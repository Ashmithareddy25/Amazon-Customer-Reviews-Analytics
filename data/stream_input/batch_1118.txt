B004I2K4DY|4.0|It is a wonderful DVD that all Les Miserables fans must have.  One can't help in comparing the current cast with the original cast (or the 10th anniversary cast).  Nevertheless, the members of the 25th anniversary cast had brought different aspects to their roles. They radiated youth, emotions and ideals in their characters.  Alfie Boe has a good voice and he interpreted Jean Valijean well.  At the encore / finale, it is absolutely splendid to hear the stunning performance of \\"Bring Him Home\\" by the four Jean Valjean's.  The singing of \\"One Day More\\" by Colm Wilkinson, the original 1985 cast and the 2010 team was another speculator performance.
0307455874|1.0|'Audacity' is full of vague promises which sound good, but ultimately remain vague.  The writing style is politically correct, and this seems more important in the book's construction than the actual political issues.  It does not contain specific plans of action for a better society, and at times sounds preachy (especially regarding 'mainstream' family values) and feel good (as in 'proud to be American').<br /><br />After reading it, I was asked what philosophy Obama stood for, based on the positions expressed in the book.  I said: \\"He stands for getting elected and what people want to hear.  He is definitely for education, Living Constitution, and the American Dream.  I don't know his policy positions, even on issues he favors.  Half the book talks about fluff like his successful Senate campaign, his childhood, or his family, but it's appealing narratives and not issues stances.\\"<br /><br />Full disclosure:  I voted for Obama in 2008, but in 2012 I voted for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.  The intellectual level of this book disappointed me.  It plays up patriotism without substance, and the positions taken on political issues are not specific.  The mind behind this book is definitely an exceptional one, but it was written in the style of a demagogue.<br /><br />Instead of this hollow work, I would recommend reading a critical analysis of Obama's actual performance in office, preferably one written by an objective journalist -- check the comments, I'll post one when I find it.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I'll start by saying I was skeptical about them doing a retake on Evangelion because it's my #1 all time favorite animation series from Japan. I was wrong however ^_^ Evangelion 1.11 is a breathtaking, beautiful, visually stunning retake of the series and now I'm hooked. I will be getting Evangelion 2.22 and anymore they come out with in the future on blu-ray and for die hard fans I'll say get this blu-ray/ dvd. Ah I can't wait to see Asuka Langley in Evangelion 2.22 she's my favorite character, but anyways 1.11 is awesome and if you liked Neon Genesis Evangelion you must look into this one.
0316154687|4.0|It took me a while to get started, but after finishing this book I realized I enjoyed this book as much as any other David Sedaris book.<br />His humor is not loud but his writing and observations will have you laughing out loud at times.

031603438X|1.0|Just because you are a rock star, doesn't mean you are a writer.  The style, grammar, sentence stucture and randomness is awful to the point of annoyance.  He rambles on about nothing for pages at a time.  The story is disjointed, incoherent and full of mumbo jumbo about songwriting and guitar tuning that makes absolutely zero sense (unless you are a junkie/rock star).  This is not the exciting book I was anticipating.  Other than the opening chapter, it is dull and disappointing.  It is nothing more than an attempt to justify his drug use.  He never atones for any of his erratic, harmful behavior.  \\"Not my fault\\", is a common phrase liberally peppered throughout the book.  He is an incredibly selfish person - you'll miss the one or two lines he alots to his children - but he blows on about his \\"god given talents\\" and friends who are not really friends at all.    All in all, a pathetic piece of work.  He clearly did not use Mr. Fox's services to help write the book.  There are much better biographies out there.
B003LWN8F8|5.0|I first bought this CD after seeing Marina live in Boston in September 2010.  Great show, except that she didn't include her best song, \\"Hermit the Frog\\".  The CD is full of catchy synth-pop and well-orchestrated sass.  At first I felt some of the songs went too easily into frothy dance-floor vampiness, but over time even they have not grown tiresome.  Indeed, six months later, its freshness seems to have increased.    Marina's songs are candidly self-referential, and slightly irreverent.  She tells us she was \\"chemically calm\\" when she signed the deal that led to this CD.  And have no doubt, she is driven to pursue her pop-star dreams.  In \\"I am not a robot\\", she gives a pep talk to the aimless mall-rat that she once was.  But she is \\"a machine\\" on \\"Oh No\\", and proudly so though somewhat conflicted.  She lets us know that she's proud and ambitious, and if that makes her something of a loner, that's the price she'll willingly pay, even though it sometimes hurts.  She deliciously puts down her airhead peers in the very catchy \\"Girls\\".  She includes many sly touches, such as on \\"Seventeen\\" when she starts singing, \\"Used to be a major scale...\\" in a minor scale, of course.    The standout song is \\"Hermit the Frog\\", a deliriously infectious romp and the closest thing to a happy-love song in this collection.  Piling on hook after hook, it is a very clever tune that never gets tiresome.  It's my pick for the top song of 2010, by far.    Marina has already achieved her stardom in my mind.
B000XSWVEC|4.0|Good band music is so rare and as u get older u only see it in the Rose Parade & it just isn't the same.  This movie is not only well acted, but is packed with well played music & I'm surprised it didn't get a little more buzz when is came out.  If you enjoy good music, competition, acting & slice of life u should get a kick out of this movie - time flies.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I was riveted with anticipation and dread as I read this compelling story.  From the title you know some key people will die.  I came away with a new understanding, appreciation, respect and gratitude for what these men do for us.
0783219733|5.0|It's unfortunate that Beethoven hasn't become a classic because I remember back in the day it was an *extremely* popular family film.  You see 20 years ago, comedies pertaining to dogs and cats wasn't yet beaten into the ground to the point of being predictably bland so the viewers were able to better appreciate them.  Perhaps that explains why this film isn't considered a classic- there's too many similar types out there these days.    Anyway, I'm not the biggest fan of Saint Bernards because they slobber a lot and actually strike me as the kind of dog that can suddenly turn vicious without giving warning (perhaps I'm wrong about that- hey, every dog is brought up differently) but when they're puppies it's impossible to deny just how adorable and surprisingly small they are.  I really enjoy the puppy segment in the beginning, especially the perfect timing of Beethoven hiding in a trashcan at just the right moment so the dognappers couldn't find him.  Oh, and we can't forget that biker chick who walked into the pet store looking for something suitable for her personality only to have a certain... disgusting incident happen, hehe.    This is the kind of well-written family movie where numerous scenes remain extremely memorable to me over the years, so the entire film flows with so much great humor and perfect timing.  Who can possibly forget the scene when the husband/father walks through the front door, sees muddy dog footprints all over his floor and carpet, and ventures upstairs only to be the victim of the greatest slobbering surprise of his life!  Nowadays I realize they exaggerated the amount of slobber flying around in every which direction, but back in the day I thought this segment was quite realistic, haha.  A similar incredibly funny segment that will probably make you laugh uncontrollably is when Beethoven hops into bed with the husband, unbeknownst to him, and Beethoven starts licking his face.  He believes it's his wife doing it, lol!  Perhaps a mildlyinappropriate moment, I admit.    I definitely do not like the one scene with the bad guy walking up to Beethoven's doghouse and deliberately trying to get Beethoven to attack him so he has a good excuse to put the dog down.  I know when the movie was being written the actors were actually playfully teasing the dog (and you can tell because Beethoven is wagging his tail the entire time) but to me it looks frighteningly realistic like animal abuse.  Also the scene where the camera is positioned through a living room window showing the little girl of Beethoven's family falling into the swimming pool and nearly drowning while the babysitter is occupied playing the piano and totally unaware what's taking place outside is VERY uncomfortable for me to watch.  Another unintentionally realistic moment.    Other memorable scenes include those two business people who not only get a spitty-tasting glass of lemonade, but receive a chair-flipping (and perfectly timed landing) adventure of a lifetime, haha.  Oh, and the bacon-stealing scene at the kitchen table is great too.    The film is incredibly brief though, at just over 80 minutes.  It felt so much longer to me back in the day.      I don't know, Beethoven just seems like such a perfect comedy to me with no flaws.  I wish more people agreed.
B00178H27S|5.0|I looked everywhere for a ball pit for my daughter's toy room and came across this.  There were two identical listings for this Intex pool except one of them (the cheaper of the two) had all poor reviews and the other had good reviews.  The particular one that I chose had the bad reviews (2 of them).  I'm guessing that perhaps the previous reviewers had been sold outdated versions of this pool.  The pool that I received has a drain spout, does not leak, and seems to be VERY durable.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|This show had extreme promise and delivered - its first 2 episodes. But then it got bogged down in a Jericho-like syrup of a story that made the zombies less and less the focus. I have no doubt that a good zombie series will play up human interactions as much or more than the zombies, but the last 3 episodes of this already-short first \\"season\\" almost had to make up a subset of the story just to have an excuse to show a few zombies. Why call it The Walking Dead when they are so minor to the story before you're halfway through??? So, 5 stars to the first 2 episodes, 4 to the third, and 1 to the final 3 equals a mediocre rating of about 3 stars. We enjoyed the story of the last 3 episodes but the title IS The Walking Dead and the Walking Dead had better play a big role in the shows or else it's a broken promise of a series.
B002IW8V0E|4.0|Love the movie and the music CD. Wish the movie would have been in full screen though. With the wide screen everything shows so small, even on a large screen. But overall really glad I got it. Meryl Streep is a riot. As long as you like ABBA music, I'd recommend this.

1416972242|4.0|In part two of Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments series, we find the characters fully engulfed in the battle to retrieve the Mortal Cup from Valentine.  In the midst of their conflicts with demons and Valentine, the love life problems continue.      In this case, not only are we dealing with a classic love triangle but a potential incestuous relationship which makes readers, including me, very uncomfortable.  Clary's determination to pursue the relationship with Jace, regardless of the consequences is really too much at times.  I do have to respect Clare for having the guts to make this choice to write this relationship in however.  She also does a great job with the Alec's sexual orientation.  She manages to intertwine his problems very naturally with the story without the use of stereotypes so commonly found in other stories of this kind.    I find Clary much more annoying in this book than I did in COB.  Maybe it's the pursuit of Jace or her use of Simon, I'm not sure.  She is a bit of a spastic personality.  One minute she yelling and taking over like she's a big, bad shadowhunter herself, the next she's weak and useless again.  I think she could have been developed a little more in COB (something that volume lacks) instead of going from a weakling to super-powerful creator ruins, something that seems to just come out of nowhere.    I still adore Jace, even with his moody ways.  Alec and Isabelle are shaping up to be great characters.  There is a lot of potential here for both to be more at the forefront in the next editions.      As with City of Bones, there is a bit of overuse the flowery, of metaphors and some long descriptive elements that slow things down a bit.  However, the book still remains a page turner.  I managed to read it in about two days, sneaking in as much time as I could to read at work and home both.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book is about Nazi, which is my favorite topic in history. Sad but touching. Love how the author organizes the story. It is a little long for me. But as a non-English speaker, this book gets rid of my obstacles and brings me into the book. Thanks for giving me this wonderful story.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I was expecting an enjoyable film, but this movie was great!  It had a good blend of action and humor, that had me hooked from the beginning.
B0016NF06O|3.0|Live recording with two star musicians performing in front of enthusiastic audience.  Guys are in top form and it must have been exciting evening,but I can't shake the feeling that we are hearing note-perfect exercise in music genre - \\"here,this is what blues sounds like\\" - I am aware that this is not New Orleans of 1920s anymore but this is music that was played for fun and dancing,not in front of seated audience with long solo instrumentals. This brings up the whole question of live recordings - exciting as they might be to audience,it is very hard to share that particular magic with listeners who were not there - some records work,some don't.   Uptempo numbers like Louis Jordan's \\"Caldonia\\"  are welcome change from flat-out monotony of blues,unfortunately there are also never-ending instrumental solos that prevent me from listening this album again.
0780622553|5.0|With nearly 500 reviews already, my input hardly counts, but I love this movie so much that I just had to add my two cents. There's a novel that accompanied the release of the movie; the book is obviously based on the movie, but it does contain a couple things not in the film. Unfortunately, these extra pieces add nothing to the story; I'm not even sure why they are in the book. For instance, when the Bumstead and Emma discover the body of the hooker John met at the Automat, Emma finds a child hiding in a side room under a bed. She obviously witnessed (her mother's?) murder, but she's never mentioned again in the book.<br /><br />Just enjoy the movie. Rufus Sewell is top-notch! Check him out in \\"Dangerous Beauty,\\" released the same year as \\"Dark City.\\" He's great! And so is \\"Dangerous Beauty,\\" for many reasons.
0345494768|5.0|\\"The Making of Star Wars\\" by JW Rinzler is a must have book for any serious fan of Star Wars or Filmmaking.  For Star Wars fans, the need to have this book is self explanatory, but for Filmmakers this book might not grab you first off as being a definitive film making resource, but it is!    This book chronicles the entire process of the making of Star Wars, one of the most successful movies of the 20th century.  Rinzler did a great job tying in George Lucas's past experiences with what eventually was seen on screen.  It also shows you the money trail that allowed Lucas to make this movie, something that a lot of \\"behind the scenes\\" books leave out.  Want to know how Lucas retained the merchandising rights to Star Wars in a time when the studios retained All rights to all movies, it's in there.  Wonder how ILM got those amazing special effects on a such low budget ($3 million), it's in there.  This book is an exhaustive resource on film making the the film business as much as it is a look into the lore and story of the movie we call Star Wars.    For costumers, the full page glossy photos are a very good resource at times, but for the most part the photos in the book are focused on production stills from the producers and concept artist points-of-view.  There are enough exclusive behind-the-scenes images in this book though that justify a Star Wars costume fanatic to buy this book.    All in all I would recommend this book to anyone wo is a Sta Wars fan of an level.  It's is a monster read (took me three weeks to read it in my off time) but the time spent in these pages is well worth it.  Buy-Buy-Buy!!!!
B003Y5H53S|3.0|Rango is a western that just happens to star animated animals instead of humans.  Little kids wouldn't care for westerns, and shouldn't be taken to them for reasons of violence, and they will not find the subject matter interesting.<br /><br />The same logic can be applied here as well.<br /><br />I took my 6 year old daughter to see Rango today, and it became apparent within 5 minutes of the movie that this would not be the ideal film for her, or any other young children.  The entire time the movie was playing, kids were talking, barely laughing, and many were obviously bored.  It's difficult to summarize quickly what was 'bad' about Rango because it's difficult to do.<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />- the animation is absolutely top-notch, picture perfect and beautiful<br />- Johnny Depp and other actors did a great job with their performances, probably due to the unique way lines were recorded<br />- tons of inside jokes that referenced other movies (I love the Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas moment)<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />- the story will bore any young child in no time flat, they just won't like it<br />- most laughs are from the inside jokes, I can't remember the theater laughing strongly at any moment<br />- the language is not good for a kid movie; others have complained about \\"hell\\" being used over and over again, I was unhappy that \\"damn\\" was used at the end for no good reason<br /><br />For adults I recommend Rango but just barely.  The story 'should' work better, but there is no clear flow to the film.  It feels jagged and rough around the edges, and just doesn't grab you.  If you appreciate animation for what it is, then I can lay 5 stars on this.  It's a treat for the eyes and will no doubt get you to say \\"wow\\" several times.<br /><br />I expected a lot more from this movie and it didn't deliver.  If the target audience truly is little kids, then higher ups should have intervened long ago.  If the audience was adults, then I guess the end result is good, but it's a shame the animation effort was used on a movie that just doesn't hit any home runs.<br /><br />***esn't hit any home runs.    ***
B000001G5H|5.0|These are magical performances. Chopin's Etudes do present the interpreter with a certain standard dilemma - how to balance the virtuoso element, the technique-related thrills and brilliance, with the musicality and poetry of the music, and while Pollini admittedly leans towards the thrill and brilliance I found these accounts utterly absorbing. His tone is beautiful, the phrasing astonishing and the color and the range of colors and expressions second to none. Even the more introvert and reflective studies work fantastically in Pollini's relatively straightforward approach due to the nuances of touch and tone he is capable of. In the faster music he is simply exhilarating; take for instance the very first track, the \\"fanfare-like\\" op.10 no.1 - I cannot believe there is a more captivating version out there.     Overall, however, there is no doubt that he is at his very best in the more dramatic and faster music. The final study of op.25, for instance, is just as breathtaking as the opening; it is an utterly gripping experience and perhaps, I wonder, the reason why this set does not include the three later etudes. In any case, the absence of these late studies is my only real objection to this recording. The sound is very vivid, although the piano tone occasionally tends towards the slightly dry. No matter; this is a marvelous release, strongly recommended.
B00013F38K|5.0|I loved this series as a child. It was a under rated t.v. program. I love the theme and plot dealt with a lot of racial issues our country was dealing with in the 40's and 50's. I defintely recommend this product.
B00110K62U|3.0|If you really want the 2008 version, go to BBC America - they are selling the 2-DVD set for $32 bucks.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|This is a movie that really isn't anything new. In fact, if you seen Black Hawk Down and District 9, it may look familiar. What this film does that makes it so great is that it can combine these elements together so well, that you really can't believe that this hasn't been done before. They made the right choice by including a Marine platoon into the script, rather than some nameless group of soldiers or whoever wears a uniform so that Johnny Civilian can get the picture that they are U.S. troops. It isn't the most perfect depiction of Marines, as I was one and remember the \\"F\\" bomb being used a whole heck of a lot more frequently, but it is passable. Aaron Eckhart really does a great job in his role as a battle tested Staff Sergeant. I think anyone else playing this character would have a hard time pulling it off exactly how he did. The rest of the cast is not all that bad either, given the scope of the story. And I am not a fan of Michelle Rodriguez, but she was tolerable- for the most part.    You have to remember that this is a movie about an alien invasion, it is not mona lisa smile. You have probably seen these movies before, but not like this. This is urban warfare fighting in the streets of downtown Los Angeles. It's fun and exciting, and better than half of the other \\"realistic\\" war movies that are already out. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes sci-fi and military movies. You wont be disappointed. The critics have taken a proverbial dump on this movie, but what do they know anyway. This is exactly the movie I expected it to be when I walked in to the theater, and a little bit more with some character believability and Aaron Eckhart's acting. I will be eagerly awaiting the Blu-ray release so that I can watch this all over again in HD in the comfort of my living room. So suspend your rational thought process for a bit and enjoy Battle: Los Angeles for what it is; a science fiction war movie. Hoo-Rah.
1582406723|5.0|I'm obsessed with The Walking Dead television show. When I learned it was based on graphic novels, I immediately had to find and read them. I was not disappointed. In fact, I was perhaps even more blown away by this first volume, Days Gone Bye, than I was with the first season of the show.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I started reading Days Gone Bye is that it is entirely in black and white. I don't have a lot of experience with graphic novels, but those that I have read have always been drawn in color. The black and white totally worked here. The drawings are beautiful, or at least as beautiful as zombies can be, and the stark lack of color matches the tone of the subject matter.<br /><br />Reading Days Gone Bye made me appreciate how well done the television show is. The show seems to have stayed very true to the story in the graphic novel thus far, with a few exceptions. Obviously, some things had to be added to the show that weren't in the original graphic novels in order to provide action for an entire season. Only one major change is glaringly obvious in the reading of Days Gone Bye and it's a complete shocker. This is worth reading for that moment alone and has completely hooked me to this series. I must find out what happens next as soon as humanly possible.<br /><br />I'm always wary going into reading something I've already seen a TV or movie adaption of. Volume 1 of The Walking Dead, Days Gone Bye, has completely amazed me, going far beyond my wildest dreams. The Walking Dead graphic novels may have just become my new obsession. Zombie mayhem at its finest.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I saw this film about two weeks before the Oscars and came out of the theater hoping that it would be recognized. There is so much more to this film than the relationship between King George VI and his speech therapist. Yes, the king had to overcome a very real problem for him. I laughed when Lionel Logue told the king's wife that her husband should get a different job and her response was \\"what if he is the king?\\" That certainly changed the tone of the therapist as he realized how important his work was to become.    I am happy that this film won the 4 awards that it did, not only for their achievement, but also for the hope that this film can bring to others with speech impediments. It is wonderfully encouraging and should be shown in all classes with students who have speech impediments. It is difficult to live in this world if you are not \\"perfect\\", and this film shows that even a king can have such problems.    If you see no other movie this year, go see \\"The Kings's Speech\\". You won't regret it!
B00127RAJY|4.0|The first couple of times I did it, I had difficulty getting through the entire workout while doing the workouts with good form.  It was definitely challenging and as I progressed, I was able to do the workouts better.  Even after using this regularly, I still get a good workout from this video each time.
B003EYVXUU|3.0|Interesting story, pretty good acting, saw the outtakes and don't understand (even with the directors reasoning)why they were left out. They didn't amount to a lot of time and in my opinion would have made the movie a little bit better. Glad I didn't spend a lot of money to watch in the theaters though.

0141439688|4.0|I purchased this book to read as an assignment for school in my British Literature class and am extremely pleased. I was not sure if I would like Jane Austen but this is an well written love story that kept me  wanting to read more with every page I turned.

1439102724|4.0|Zoe and Max have been trying to have a baby for nine years. Nine years of needles and medicine, IVF treatments and fifteen-thousand dollar injections that don't work. Nine years until Zoe is the closest she has ever been to becoming a mother [...] 28 weeks pregnant and it looks as though nine years of trying will finally pay off [...]. until it doesn't, and Zoe has a stillborn.<br /><br />Max has had enough. His wife is forty-years-old now, the wrong side of statistics for successful IVF treatments. He doesn't want to try for heartbreak anymore. He doesn't want to try for a baby, and he doesn't want to try for Zoe either. So he files for divorce.<br /><br />While Max finds answers at the bottom of a bottle, Zoe trudges through her life believing she has lost her last chance for a baby. And then she meets Vanessa. Vanessa is a school counsellor who has employed Zoe as a music therapist . . . and then she becomes Zoe's best friend. And then she becomes the one person Zoe can't live without.<br /><br />Max drank to forget and to feel. Max drank, and almost killed himself - until Jesus saved him. After a near-death experience, Max is welcome into the fold of the Eternal Glory Church. Max is born again, and he can see the mistakes he made with Zoe. Mistakes he vows to never make again, now that Jesus is his personal lord and saviour.<br /><br />Zoe and Vanessa are in love, and they want a family. It doesn't matter that the state of Massachusetts doesn't recognize their marital status, or that Zoe has never felt more targeted than when she walks down the street holding Vanessa's hand. They want a family, because they know they have love to give. So when Zoe suggests using her and Max's remaining three frozen embryos, it seems motherhood is within reach for her once more.<br /><br />But if Zoe can claim the embryos are hers by biological right, then Max can claim the same. And Max steadfastly believes that Jesus Christ does not want his deviant ex-wife to raise his children in a house of homosexual sin.<br /><br />[...] SPOILER ALERT [...]<br /><br />I always have to prepare myself for a Jodi Picoult book. Because I what will happen while I read one of her novels - I will be turned into a blubbering mess as I read vicariously and viscerally about the characters. I know that Jodi Picoult books are mostly formulaic - take a water-cooler issue; leave it to simmer and hit close to home, then sprinkle with a little courtroom drama for a finishing touch. I know this, and yet Picoult gets me every time! Without fail, I will find myself hiccup-crying throughout her books and muttering insults and \\"oh my gawds!\\" through the reading. And she does it to me again in `Sing You Home'. . .<br /><br />The first-half of the book follows Zoe and Max through the stillborn birth of their IVF baby, a tragedy that proves to be the final straw that breaks their nine-year marriage. Picoult's exploration of IVF and the couples who navigate the peaks and valleys of infertility treatments is interesting in itself.<br /><br />Picoult writes about infertility from the perspective of the husband. Max has a low sperm count, and when coupled with Zoe's own infertility issues the pair spend their nine-year marriage in and out of fertility clinics, ruled by Zoe's ovulation and bankrupted by expensive IVF treatments ([...] a pop!). Mostly when infertility is mentioned it's to the sympathies of the mother who can't conceive. After all, what is more natural and womanly than childbirth? The very yardstick by which society measures a woman's femininity and worth. Picoult observes how all-consuming the baby race can be as Zoe admits to letting pregnant friends fall by the way-side out of spite and jealousy over her own inability to conceive. Until, nine years later, Zoe and Max are wholly-consumed by their baby needs. All that's left in their marriage is scheduled-injections and money crunching for more treatments.<br /><br />Picoult delves in Max's mindset, at being unable to impregnate his wife. The humiliation of having to fill up a plastic cup and walk into a clinic where everyone knows what goes on behind closed doors. More than that, Max articulates the seemingly overwhelming emphasis that society places on fertility and reproduction.<br /><br />All of this is very interesting, and heartbreaking, but not terribly Picoult-esque. Anyone who has read a Picoult book knows that she thrives in the gray areas - her stories burst to life with contentions and tensions. And so I spent the first-half of `Sing You Home' wondering where the drama lay in the heartbreak.<br /><br />. . . And then Zoe falls in love with a woman, while Max is `born again. Zoe wants to use the embryos she and Max created to get her new wife pregnant.<br /><br />Ah, there's that drama!<br /><br />As the story begins and Zoe miscarries, only to be divorced by her husband, she seems sure to be the wronged party. Readers (the majority of whom will be female) may think the story black and white, Max malicious and Zoe wounded.  But Jodi Picoult is best for her shades of gray. She doesn't give her readers an easy out; her characters are neither heroes nor villains, and she refuses to write situations that have clear paths and obvious conclusions. At least, this is where Picoult normally excels.<br /><br /> I will admit that in `Sing You Home' Picoult is heavy-handed with the religious right. She does portray them as hate-mongers and uneducated bible-thumpers. By contrast, Zoe and Vanessa are two smart, caring and witty young women (a school counsellor and music therapist who works with burn victims and abused children, respectively). `Sing You Home' is one of the few Picoult books that occasionally lapses into shades of black and white. . . Admittedly, I am one of those who think that religion has no right to say who anyone should love, let alone marry. I support gay marriage (and with that Julia Gillard did too). But even I thought that Picoult was painting a very villainous picture of religion in this book.<br /><br />If reading Jodi Picoult has taught me anything, it's that there are never just two sides to a story - there's more like twenty-two. But in `Sing You Home' Picoult seems reluctant to write beyond the open-minded GLAAD (The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) and evilly close-minded religious right.<br /><br />I missed Picoult's trademark unbiased writing when it came to the politics in `Sing You Home'. But that doesn't mean she didn't sucker-punch my emotions while reading this book. As always with a Picoult book, I learnt a little something - about IVF treatments, the legal standing of gay couples in America and the religious foundations that inform `right to life' campaigns. I blubbered, I power-read in one day and I definitely intend to pass this book on to friends and family . . . Picoult may have a formula, but it's a winning formula to be sure!cup and walk into a clinic where everyone knows what goes on behind closed doors. More than that, Max articulates the seemingly overwhelming emphasis that society places on fertility and reproduction.     All of this is very interesting, and heartbreaking, but not terribly Picoult-esque. Anyone who has read a Picoult book knows that she thrives in the gray areas - her stories burst to life with contentions and tensions. And so I spent the first-half of `Sing You Home' wondering where the drama lay in the heartbreak.    . . . And then Zoe falls in love with a woman, while Max is `born again. Zoe wants to use the embryos she and Max created to get her new wife pregnant.    Ah, there's that drama!     As the story begins and Zoe miscarries, only to be divorced by her husband, she seems sure to be the wronged party. Readers (the majority of whom will be female) may think the story black and white, Max malicious and Zoe wounded.  But Jodi Picoult is best for her shades of gray. She doesn't give her readers an easy out; her characters are neither heroes nor villains, and she refuses to write situations that have clear paths and obvious conclusions.

B002ZG99CC|3.0|First of all, this really should be called The Kung Fu Kid. The reason it's not must be fear of separation from the marketing brand name.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie both covers familiar ground, and strays from the details in the original...if not the formula. \\"Wax on, wax off\\" has been replaced by a muscle memory training technique that is SOOOOOOO Jackie Chan. And speaking of Jackie Chan, it's cool they cast a real martial artist to be the kid's teacher this time. In the pivotal fight scene, he turns the young hoodlums' own energy against themselves in classic Jackie Chan clownish fashion.<br /><br />Some of the plot points are a little weak, and the bad guys are as B-movie Nazi diabolical as ever, but the fight choreography is superior to that in the original IMO.<br /><br />This is a nice flick to enjoy with the family.<br /><br />Henry Brown is the author of historical comedy-adventure Thus Spake the Bard, as well as the military thriller Hell and Gone. He is the columns editor at New Pulp Fiction, and does some blogging of his own at the Two-Fisted Blogger.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Richard Gere plays Parker Wilson, a college professor, who encounters an abandoned dog at the commuter rail station.<br /><br /> Gere has to convince his wife, unconvincingly played by Joan Allen, to allow him to keep the dog.<br /><br /> The story develops around the relationship between Gere and the dog. The dog is somewhat idiosyncratic and won't fetch balls and such mundane things. But he becomes Parker's boon companion accompanying him to the train station in the morning and waiting for him to arrive back at the station at night. Hachi becomes well known in the small town and everyone from the stationmaster to the hot dog vendor to the local meat market treats Hachi well.<br /><br /> It's a touching story, but only a prelude to the real story, the one that will quickly bring out the tissues. I'm not going to throw out any spoilers here, but Hachi goes on to prove his devotion to Parker.<br /><br /> Gere does well in the role, but the real stars in this movie are the director (Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m), the writer, the dogs who play Hachi from puppy to old age and the animal trainers.<br /><br /> There are no hidden messages here. Just a sentimental journey and a good one at that.<br /><br />Jerry

0802798225|5.0|i am gonna make it short and sweet. This book is amazing! It has the perfect amount of humor and romance, it will make you laugh and cry all in one page. Alex is so sweet behind his bad-boy persona, all he really wants to do is protect the ones he loves. I would probably have hated Brittney if not for her inner vulnerability as well as how kind she is to her sister. The romance was torn between hot/cute, which was perfect. All in all this book is one you will read over and over.
0061726826|4.0|This book started out very intriguing, I was impressed with the writing style and the details. It was set up for a great story. Somewhere in the middle however, I began to lose interest. Maybe it was too many details on the love story without going more indepth into the character of Lena and the decision she faces, I'm not really sure, but I began to get bored and by the last third I was rushing through just to find out how it ends. The ending I also found a little unsatisfying, it felt like there could have been more. I have heard a sequel is planned, so if that is the case then maybe we will get more. Either way, it was a good book but if it could have kept up the interest the way the first third did it would have been great, in my opinion.
B004G5ZXVQ|1.0|Been a big REM fan.  Thought their best work was Up, Reveal, Automatic, Out of time.  Their last great album was Reveal.  Since then, all subsequent albums have gotten worse.  Collapse is no better.  Just awful.  Maybe it's time for REM to just go away.

B0037KMHRY|5.0|Not always favored of strange music, but this music used in Tron is entrancing and does not bore me.  Some of the older titles of music that use electronic instrumeting and scoring I have also great to listen to, like Switched on Bach.  I guess I appreciate more the music versus the vocals (sometimes just too hard to listen to or understand) in my selections.  If you have other music you enjoy, if you can mix some of the tracks inbetween other tracks, this will provide a bit of diversity in music while on a jog or just quiet time at home.

B002KH4KSY|5.0|In this movie, it follows the original short story, much more closely, lets ignor the fact it has a downer ending. and go into specifics      The children arent as Sadistic, as they were in the original movie. They act out of a genuine, if to our perspective, mad, piety.    Isaac, lacks the Smarmyness, he had in the original, there It seemed he was just enjoying feeling important and being manipulative.    It also in other parts of the original Children of the corn series, suggested that the children were mind controlled.    In this verison though, their simply acting out of piety, mixed with desperation.

1442337966|4.0|I was familiar with Rhonda Byrne's Book/film, The Secret and gained much insight into the power of The Law of Attraction. So I was eager to get The Power. Basically the reason I didn't rate it a 5, was that the first part seemed to just restate what I learned in The Secret, but in a different manner. The Power has a lot of very good information & principals and I've gained much from reading it; I was just a little let down that it wasn't as good as her previous book.

B0045TQF88|4.0|12/8/2012 * This 2 disc set is going out of print, so if you are on the fence better act quick!<br /><br />This review pre-supposes the folowing things...<br /><br />#1. That what is on the release is what is on it, not what \\"isn't\\" on it. (We all have hopes of what could<br /> have been included, but they may not exist or may not be finnancially realistic for this re-issue)<br /><br />#2.That this isn't compared to other Rainbow albums, because each one and each line -up must be compared within the context of what personnel are involved and what style/direction the music is.(e.g. This is not Rainbow \\"Rising\\")<br /><br />#3. That an understanding of sound quality exists in order to compare your expectations to that of what actually is on the tape! (e.g. Some Rainbow albums were recorded better technically than others, and Rainbow often recorded in \\"unconventional\\" environments. Also, who produced the album. Big difference in Martin Birch and Roger Glover.<br /><br /> \\"Down to Earth\\" was never my favorite Rainbow album. It is a very commercial album. The lyrics, written by Roger Glover are just horrendous. Having said that, here are my thoughts. I look at this release, and the added expense, as being able to get a glimpse into the recording process. It will probably be the final time I buy this album, unless they re-do the catalog in 5.1 surround. (Which would be awesome) So until or if that happens this is the definiive version for me. The bonus tracks are not just the tracks without the vocals such as \\"some\\" of the Black Sabbath \\"Paranoid\\" bonus tracks. These are various renderings with the emphasis on different combinations of instruments. To me the most interesting was \\"Making Love\\" as it reveals many Blackmore licks that were otherwise buried.(And his incredible melodic nature) Some of the bonus tracks have the solos, some do not. It's a chance to hear Cozy again and to realize how much frequency space was given to his drum sound! These are interesting glimpsesinto how the songs evolved. Graham Bonnet was a perfect choice at this particular time for this more -commercial-version of the band. His vocals are just incredible. *Even after listening to the greatness of Ronnie Dio on the Deluxe Rising edition I still marvel at how good Bonnet was. The guy had one powerful voice. Blackmore was amazing at finding talent.<br /><br />The remastering is good but don't expect something drastic. This IS remastered and IS clearly from the masters/multitracks. The album has a very dry and focused sound. (I listened with Sennhieser HD 280 pro headphones on this ,so that is worth noting as headphones are a different listening experience than speakers.) While this may be a controversial statement I believe this album is lacking a certain clarity. This is not a comment on the way it is mastered!<br /><br />I recommend this as a replacement for previous issues to any serious Blackmore fan.  Even though I am a bit of an audiophile I am aware that there are differences in the circumstances and ways albums were recorded. Some albums will never sound as clean and or warm as others. Some albums were over driven at the recording stage \\"Deep Purple In Rock\\" was that way. I hope reviewers won't use the word \\"compression\\" too much because that word is so misunderstood and mis-used. This release IS an improvement over the last remaster. It is also an improvement over the the Japanese mini lp sleeves too, as I have one.<br /><br />This edition has the UNBELIEVABLE instrumental \\"Weiss Heim\\" on it too!!! (If oly Rithie would give us a full album of instrumentals like this)<br /><br />The standout performers are Blackmore & Bonnet here. Don Airey has always been amazing, but the other two really stood out to me. There are some neat synthesizer moments that were revealed in the bonus tracks that were not heard before. Interesting stuff to me.<br /><br />I am happy with the product. There's some nice liner notes inside too. (Some from Blackmore's diary apparently)<br /><br />I have noticed some European reviews that \\"may\\" have missed the point. They intimated that the release was sort of a desperate money grab. To me, it's an expanded release, and if you don't want to spend the money, then dont!<br /><br /> I give it 4 stars. Minus one only because (I believe) Roger Glover didn't capture Ritchies guitar tone that well on this album and that it isn't one of my favorites. It is a good value. The CD is for those who want it all. Whether or not you will listen to the bonus tracks over and over isn't the point. I have listened to the bonus disc three times now. (I like hearing the little details like how Cozy emphasizes high-hat hits and things like that.)Rainbow weren't a band to do lots of unreleased tracks. The point is that is is a privelage that we can hear these alternates at all! Would you have paid $25 to sit in the corner of the studio to watch this band record? This isn't that, but it's closer to that than we were before this release!<br /><br />By the way Ritchie did have input on this release as his management is mentioned. I look forward to the other albums. Please release more Ritchie! (Like those studio guitar instrumentals over the drum machine from \\"Slaves & Masters\\" era)<br /><br />This \\"Down to Earth\\" line up was killer live too! Very English sounding and very unique, almost \\"aristocratic melodic Rock\\" Too bad \\"Castle Donnington\\" hasn't ever been released in it's entirety on DVD!<br /><br />Serious fans should pick this \\"Deluxe Edition\\" up<br />:)

159420229X|5.0|As Joshua Foer explains and demonstrated by winning a memory competition, it's within our grasp to master memory techniques and they work.  Mnemonic techniques include the Roman room system; the journey system, the link method and story method - and more.  The more mental tools one can use, the better.      Memory issues are everywhere.  We make lists; file electronic documents; use calendars and tickler files.  We place things in visible locations so we don't have to remember to use them or tote them somewhere.  Yet we can't capture, store and properly retrieve most information using such external systems.  We're stuck relying on our physical memory.  Fortunately, per Moonwalking with Einstein, our physical memory is robust.  We can do more than we think, and this affects our self-confidence.    Using techniques covered in this book, I was able to recall most of what I wanted in a snap.  This made me feel more confident in myself, and that helped me to remember even better.  My experience with this book makes me believe the two go together:  memory and self-confidence.

B003L20IDI|4.0|The Adjustment Bureau, directed by George Nolfi and starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, is something of a rarity - a romance movie within a sci-fi setting that actually works. The reason for this is that while The Adjustment Bureau is nominally based on a short story - \\"The Adjustment Team\\" - by Philip K. Dick, at its heart its true roots are to be found in Michael Powell's 1946 romantic fantasy film Stairway To Heaven (also known by its original UK title A Matter Of Life And Death), where two people who meet by chance and fall in love must deal with divine powers bent on seperating them.<br /><br />A rising young New York politician, David Norris (Matt Damon), on election night of his first senate bid, has a chance meeting with a young dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) that changes his life. But unfortunately he comes away from the encounter with only her first name and nothing else, leaving him no way of finding her. One morning, a short time later, we become aware that a group of men, all wearing hats, seem to be taking a strange interest in Norris. One of them, who goes by the name of Harry (Anthony Mackie), has been given the strange assignment of making sure Norris spills his coffee on himself by 7:05AM. Things, however, do not go as planned, and as a result, two things happen:  (1) Norris runs into Elise on the bus, this time getting her phone number, and (2) Norris inadvertently stumbles across the existence of the Men In Hats in the act of manipulating events in his life. And is told by them that he must never reveal what he has learned to anyone, and that he must never see Elise again because it's not part of their plan for him. And because seeing her will not only ruin their plans for him, it'll ruin the bright future they have planned for her as well.<br /><br />The cast is excellent and is a large part of what makes The Adjustment Bureau work.  Matt Damon and Emily Blunt project a believable chemistry of two people who from the first moment know they were always meant to be together. John Slattery (best known from TV's Mad Men) is perfect as Richardson, the officious leader of the team of agents managing Norris' life. Terrence Stamp is marvelous as always as Thompson, the hard-nosed trouble shooter nicknamed \\"The Hammer\\" who is brought in when things really go awry. But it is Anthony Mackie who gives the movie a lot of its heart as Harry, the low-key agent with doubts about the plan. Mackie never raises his voice, never lets Harry's feelings show on his face, but conveys everything with his subtly expressive eyes.<br /><br />There are also a host of cameos of public figures from the political and media arenas, meant I suppose to make things more realistic, but in truth they're incidental, particularly in a film like this where a good deal of suspension of disbelief is necessary.  Still, some people will have fun seeing how many they can spot. I counted at least eight.<br /><br />As enjoyable as The Adjustment Bureau is, it does require certain periodic suspensions of disbelief which I cannot dwell on without revealing certain parts of the plot. And while it does at least toy with questions of free-will vs predestined fate, in the end it is a romance story and does opt for the ending that most easily satisfies. It might have been a deeper, more complex movie if Nolfi had had Norris make a less conventional choice, either choosing to stay with the plan the Men In Hats have laid out for him, giving up love for career, or sacrificing his own chance at happiness so that Elise can have the grand career he knows is awaiting her.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen Stairway To Heaven will instinctively know how this all turns out.

Favorite quote from the movie: \\"You're never really done for, as long as you've got a good story and someone to tell it to.\\"  That quote applies well to the movie.

0811870413|5.0|I have purchased several artisan bread baking books which were interesting and informative.  However, this book gives key steps to perfection in making artisan bread.  While my previous sourdough loaves were acceptable, my loaves now are full of flavor lasting several weeks without deterioration allowing me to bake several loaves at a time.  A sandwich from bread made using these methods is a savory treat.  And butter is a distant memory when eating the bread unadorned.  I highly recommend this book.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|DVD REVIEW: 'Inside Job': Documentary on financial meltdown pulls no punches, blames Obama, Bush 43, Clinton, CEOs, economists, regulators who didn't regulate -- everybody<br /><br />I have a bone to pick with movie distribution: Why can't we see documentaries on the big screen when they're released? If ever there was a timely documentary, it's \\"Inside Job\\" written and directed by Charles Ferguson (Sony Pictures Classics, 2010, 109 minutes, PG-13, released on DVD March 8, 2011) and the winner of the feature documentary category at the recent Academy Awards ceremony.<br /><br />I've read and reviewed several books, maybe even a dozen, about the financial meltdown, the villains, the causes, the failure of the government to regulate, the power of the lobbyists -- who seem to favor and reward with campaign contributions Obama as much as they did Bush and Clinton -- and the guilty people escaping with their fortunes intact while ordinary people around the world were scammed. \\"Inside Job,\\" narrated by Matt Damon, covers all these topics thoroughly and adds a dimension I haven't seen covered adequately in the books I've read: the co-opting of academic economists by financial institutions that pay them megabucks to shill for their fraudulent products.<br /><br />If I'm being too harsh on the likes of Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase, Lehman Brothers, A.I.G. and the rest of the scummy bunch, so be it. Ferguson interviews several academics and to a man -- and to a woman, counting Professor Laura Dyson of the University of California at Berkeley, a favorite of Bill Clinton -- they saw nothing wrong in touting deregulation and writing articles for financial firms for fees that would support me and a couple of my friends in style for a year.<br /><br />\\"Inside Job\\" focuses on changes lin the financial industry in the decade leading up to the crisis that erupted full blown in 2008. I was especially pleased to see Ferguson mention one of the contributing factors to the meltdown, the repeal of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act that separated commercial and investment banks. Glass-Steagall worked well for almost 70 years and should have been retained.<br /><br />Glass-Steagall was an impediment to the new financial products the scamsters wanted to foist on the public, so it was repealed in the Clinton Administration, in 1999, with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a product of Wall Street, one of the leading cheerleaders. It was replaced with the weak Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (AKA:  the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999),  which removed the Chinese wall separating relatively safe commercial banking from highly speculative \\"investment\\" banking. The Gramm in the bill is Republican Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, now thankfully a former senator, whose wife, Wendy, was a former chair of the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission and later a member of the board of Enron, where she picked up gigantic  bucks for her efforts at the failed Houston company. Talk about conflicts of interest! This kind of \\"modernization\\" we don't need!<br /><br />In addition to repealing strong legislation like Glass-Steagall, \\"Inside Job\\" covers the revolving door conflicts of interest of people like Wendy Gramm, Martin Feldstein and many others -- conflicts of interest that Ferguson says are not properly disclosed. Then there's the matter of the three rating agencies -- Standard & Poor's, Moody, and Fitch -- that gave the highest rating  -- AAA -- to subprime derivatives that turned out to be toxic assets, an oxymoron if ever there was one.<br /><br />Ferguson and his outstanding  production and writing and research team makes it possible for the average person to at least get a grasp on the fraud involved in such products as the derivatives, as well as the scamming that went on at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The housing bubble is properly blamed for contributing in a major way to the superheated market, which collapsed so spectacularly in 2008.<br /><br />\\"Inside Job\\" is on target again when it shows how the high risks underlying subprime lending by Countrywide Financial and many other financial institutions were passed hand to hand like a red hot steel ball from investors to other investors, who believed the phony ratings from the Big Three and ended up losing all their money.  Institutions like the Mississippi retirement fund ended up the losers, as did the entire country of Iceland, whose financial meltdown is shown in the film's cold open (starting the film before the opening credits).<br /><br />Ferguson says we're not getting \\"Change We Can Believe In\\" -- an Obama campaign slogan, because President Barack Obama not only hasn't unleashed federal agencies on the scamsters, he has ended up appointing or reappointing many of the same people Ferguson says were behind the meltdown in the first place -- among them Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, economic adviser and former treasury secretary Larry Summers and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Ferguson ends his wonderful documentary be saying that Obama's much touted and recently passed \\"financial reforms\\" are so weak that we're in the same place we were  before the meltdown, with an unchanged underlying system. Countrywide's Angelo Mozillo isn't in prison, nor are his fellow fraudsters, Ferguson points out.<br /><br />I wish Ferguson had included an interview with Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), who is highly critical of the opaque Federal Reserve System, but he did have an impressive lineup of people who were interviewed, including NYU economics professor Nouriel Roubini, AKA \\"Doctor Doom.\\" To my knowledge, nobody has hired Roubini for big bucks to tout derivatives or deregulation!<br /><br />Get a copy of \\"Inside Job\\" and look up the study guide that goes with it (Link: [...]). If you thought the meltdown was bad, you ain't heard nothing' yet! The entire system was --  and is -- rotten to the core.subprime lending by Countrywide Financial and many other financial institutions were passed hand to hand like a red hot steel ball from investors to other investors, who believed the phony ratings from the Big Three and ended up losing all their money.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|The chemistry between the characters is GREAT. And the humor is so subtle (and not so subtle sometimes) the characters have great deep personalities. The victims die in cool ways. Its not as predictable as some other \\"cop shows\\". Castle himself is hilarious. Great great cast, hope this show is on forever.

B00005JLSE|1.0|If men were in the lead roles, the film would rightly be condemned as a cynical, misogynistic pile of garbage.  As it stands, it gets oscars.  What gives?  What if I made a movie about black people who own white slaves?  What if I somehow was able to make that movie without it seeming ironic?  What if I dressed up a movie about horrific, barely provoked, let alone justified, violence with snazzy 1930's style musical numbers that glorified the perpetrators of said violence, with their names writ-large in glowing neon letters?  Would a large percentage of you still love the movie?  What if instead of \\"Roxie\\", we had a male character who shot the woman he was cheating on his wife with, treated that wife like garbage, then became a media darling...would you all love it so much then?  What if the character playing that male slimeball was anorexic and could neither sing, dance, nor act, THEN what would you all think?
0307454541|2.0|The first chapter does grab you, but after that it was easy to figure out what happened to the main character - no surprise there.  I did not find any of the characters likeable, nor did I enjoy the author's writing style.  I became tired of reading the same adjective to describe Lisbeth - \\"taciturn\\" - yes, we figured that out when she was first introduced in the story.  I just wasn't enthralled with the bondage theme throughout the book, nor with the listless relationships between Blonkvist and Berger/Lisbeth.  I will not be continuing the series.
0375831002|5.0|This is a beautifully, creatively written novel. The metaphors and the emphasis of the story on relationships and the power of the written word is quite spectacular. For a fairly long book, I never tired of it, it held me captivated from beginning to end. It is a story that opens your heart to the human condition in such a lovely way.
B002ZG976U|5.0|My husband and I watched this on pay-per-view this past weekend; boy, has Cher still got the voice.  Christina has always been one of my favorites, and she was at her all-time best.  She can dance as well as she sings; can we say Broadway musical? We do regret not going to the theater and seeing it, because of the AWESOME music; it would have sounded way beyond great. One more thing: what woman do you know, at 65-years-old, still looks and sings THAT AWESOME?  No one but CHER!!
0452284392|4.0|Linked explores how networks are formed across a variety of perspectives ranging from urban development to in-person networking to the internet. I must admit, I'd be fascinated to see what the author would say about social networks, but this book was written before they were developed. With that said, this book provides some fascinating information on how networks are formed and maintained as well as giving some consideration on how people can understand and work with networks better. It's a useful book for anyone to read because it will help you understand what networking really is and what it could be.
0545265355|3.0|I thought it would be a great trilogy and would capture me, like Twilight and Harry Potter did, but, I am having a hard time getting into this book.  It isn't bad, I am having a hard time being sold on the premise.
B004I2K4DY|1.0|Why was he cast in the first place?? He isn't even close in vocal talent as the rest of the cast.  He had short breathy phrases and had the same pained look on his face throughout.  I was actually embarassed for him.  I am not sure I am going to buy this dvd because I couldn't bear the thought of having to watch Nick again!!  I think I'll get out my 10th anniversary concert instead!
B00000J0O2|1.0|Ordered from Adorama camera store (adorama.com) - as a spare for my HP laserjet 3100.  I needed it and tried to use it about 1 month after receipt.  It is completely useless, was either too old or completedly used but can hardly read the print.  Adorama refused to allow a return and replacement as the return period had expired.  Warning to all those who want to save like me.
B002436WFI|2.0|I read the book \\"The Color of Magic\\" and found it extremely amusing. The DVD? Well, it didn't seem like anything Terry Pratchett ever wrote. I can't see Rincewind being that old either. Perhaps he was, but to me he seemed younger. In the book, the story flowed, but in the film, it seemed to jump around from one thing to another...in other words...to me, it was a dissapointment.
B003D83DPA|1.0|I have to agree with multiple others here who have said that this product is deficient and sub-standard in virtually every respect. In fact, it is so poor in terms of the overall package (audio + video) that it does an incredible injustice to the world class artists involved. When all is said and done, Mark Knopfler will go down as one of the top five guitarists of all-time, and fortunately, the audio portion of this disc continues to preserve his outstanding artistry with a Fender Stratocaster, but to characterize the grainy, scratchy, 2nd rate video portion of this disc as \\"Blu-Ray\\" is misleading and almost unlawful! The quality of the video on my VHS tape of this same concert is INFINITELY superior to this so-called \\"Blu-Ray\\" disc. Save your money and hope that they re-release this performance again some day with video of proper quality.
B000BVXC7Q|5.0|Some beautiful music. I was considering this and David Zinmans's set (B000BITTYE), which I haven't heard. I chose this set because of the selections included and am very happy.

1569242739|5.0|I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but I bought this book cause I thought vegan baking would be a nice challenge.  I started out with the basics: golden vanilla cupcakes with vanilla \\"buttercream\\" frosting. I really thought there was going to be some sort of trick to making these turn out ok but there really wasn't. The recipe was just easy! Almost fool-proof. I made 2 batches and, the second time around, I didn't even have to look at the recipe, it was just THAT basic. The cupcakes turned out fantastic! A lot better than regular, non-vegan, cupcakes I've made recently. The cake was moist, but not \\"heavy\\", and fluffy. The cupcakes almost turned out as if they were made with store-bought mix. The frosting was also perfect. I frosted these the night before bringing them in to work and the frosting kept it's shape without melting or falling flat and tasted like normal buttercream frosting. This will likely be my go-to cupcake baking recipe book from now on, vegan or not.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|If you're into seeing things how they really were this is the series for you. Was pretty graphic but told the story well. If you liked \\"Band of Brothers\\" chances are you like this series.
0802473156|5.0|This is a great book. I learned a lot of myself and my spouse. There's an underlying religious tone to the book, but the author doesn't throw God or the Bible in your face so if you aren't very religious, you could still learn a lot from this book. I'll be recommending this book to anyone who's in a relationship.
B004R0WKNE|4.0|I wanted to see this in movie and didn't get a chance so I was glad to see in here.  I enjoyed it all good story line, music, nothing bad to say at all, and I have already recommended the movies to family and friends.  Watch it!

Turn it on, and let it take your mind to sweet and refreshing places. If you're on the fence about buying it, take the plunge...you'll listen to this album again and again.

B000001FFJ|5.0|I'm a long time fan of Tom Waits and own 10 of his albums and Heart of Saturday night, Rain Dogs, Bone Machine, and Mule Variations all fight for the spot of best album by him for me. Rain dogs is a nice place to start if your new to Tom, which unbelievably so many people are. If you don't know about him he is an amazing artist and may take a few listens to find beauty but he is definitely worth your time especially rain dogs which is an amazing place to start so buy it if your reading this. Enjoy
1400079276|3.0|Haruki Murakami is one of the most famous contemporary Japanese writers. He has gained a cult status worldwide, and his \\"Kafka on the shore\\" displays the characteristics that have made his literature famous: the Eastern sensibility filtered for the Western expectations. His combination of ancient legends and pop culture assure him to be read and loved outside Japan.<br /><br />\\"Kafka on the shore\\" is a rollercoaster ride populated with strange creatures and bizarre events. Here old Greek tragedies and oriental beliefs bring exoticism to the narrative, that intertwines the stories of two characters. One of them is fifteen year-old who wants to be called Kafka. He flees his home, because his father makes a prophecy: the boy would sleep with his mother and sister and kill his father. He has never met his mother and sister. After a strange event when he was a child, Satoru Nakata acquired the ability to talk to cats, and have unusual dialogues with felines.<br /><br />Murakami follows an annoying structural rigor that alternated first person chapters (Kakfa's) and third person ones (Nakata's). Both characters, at certain point, are on the road, and it is not a surprise that they story will meet in the end. It would be too bold of Murakami to keep both narratives apart. It feels like a plastered book, replete with anticipation since from early the reader is aware that The Big Meeting will happen.<br /><br />A rain of fishes instead of water, or Kafka's alter-ego, to whom he refers as `the boy called Crown\\" added to Murakami's taste for symbols and metaphors may scare the reader, but, after all, it is an easy reading. Maybe we shouldn't expect too much of the novel - we should only lay back and give ourselves to the pleasure of the strangeness.

B003E8P9G0|4.0|Like most people who are considering this book, you probably are a fan of the author's Percy Jackson series as I am.  But before buying though, you have to consider one thing: THIS IS NOT A PERCY JACKSON ANNEX!<br /><br />Honestly, I'm torn about commenting on this book, there is something strange that I can't make out which has stopped me from giving it 5 stars and almost giving it a 3.<br /><br />1)  Though technically, the book was written in a superb fashion, I found finishing the book an arduous task.  I felt like I just wanted to finish it to just get over with it.  Sometimes, I even skimmed through paragraphs where the author is describing the scene just to get to the meaty stuff.<br /><br />2)  The author has successfully escaped the \\"Harry Potter\\" parallelism that which Percy Jackson was cursed with.  But the thing is, this book is tethering on being an Egyptian version of Michael Scott's THE SECRETS OF THE IMMORTAL NICHOLAS FLAMEL series, which a lot of people has pegged as the \\"new\\" Harry Potter.<br /><br />3)  The author was too blatant in putting clues in this book that there will be a tie-in with the Percy Jackson / Heroes of Olympus series in the future (near or distant).  It was too obvious that I actually thought \\"OK I'LL SKIP THIS SERIES AND WAIT TILL THE SIBLINGS MEET UP WITH PERCY AND JASON\\".<br /><br />4)  There were some inconsistencies regarding one of the major character's past (the sibling's immortal side-kick for those who've already read the book).  The nature of the Egyptian gods has also made understanding a definite timeline/sequence of events rather difficult for light reading.  If you enjoy taking notes while reading a YA book, then you might probably enjoy this element of the novel.<br /><br />5)  The only reason I didn't give this a 3 was of the plot twist in the end, making the 2nd installment a promising read.<br /><br />In summary, if you enjoyed the Percy Jackson series and believe that this book will quench your thirst while waiting for the next installment on the Heroes of Olympus series .. it won't!!!<br /><br />I think the chunk of the reason why I didn't enjoy this as much as the PJ series is that I am not too familiar with Egyptian mythology as I am of Greek & Roman.  If you really want to read this book though, and you have limited Egyptian Myth background,  I suggest you dabble in it first by reading online.  If you find Egyptian Mythology interesting, then you would probably enjoy the book more than I did.  If you don't, then reading this book will just confuse you like I was in some instances.<br /><br />The book is well written, but if Egyptian Mythology isn't for you, reading the novel will feel like making a pyramid yourself.series .. it won't!!!

B0000263JN|5.0|First heard this back in about 1971 or so.  Had a greatest hits compilation in the 80s and now I've got the original. It's a unique sound particularly against the grain at the time. A very cellular song is the bomb!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I truly enjoyed this CD. I really wanted to hear the rest of the CD after hearing 'Little Lion Man' and 'The Cave'. I bought and it's a very soulful and fun CD. 'Awake My Soul' is so great and the harmonies make me smile. Mumford & Sons has their own unique sound and it is apparent in each of their songs.

B0000033OZ|5.0|I just listened to this album full time through for the first time.  It's a nice piece of work at times smooth or disjointed, harmonious or semi-chaotic.  The words seem kind of profound as well from what I could hear.  Then I noticed this album cover and kind of \\"saw it\\" for the first time.  You've got this dove like bird half forming the back and top of a man's head while the other wing vibrates off into the rest - the world, the unknown, the spirit, the air, the ether..  just seemed kind of suitable for an album where you can tell the players are often riding the groove both musically and psychologically. A nice album if you're in the space for it. Lucky Man ties it up beautifully.    Also enjoyed tonight one of the CDs from the Jimi Hendrix Experience Box Set.  They've done a nice job there as well, with lots of previously unissued renditions remastered up nicely. That and the ELP were a fun combo.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The movie itself was fantastic, one of the best translations from book to screen yet! I'm really disappointed though at the lack of features on the DVD, as well as the fact that there doesn't seem to be a 2-disc special edition available for those of us (however small a faction that may be lol) who do not have blu-ray players. Hoping they'll release a 2-disc at a later point so I don't have to miss out on the special features completely.

0930289234|5.0|Of course made popular now because of the movie - this graphic novel is both idiosyncratic and revolutionary by Alan Moore.  This graphic novel is a must read for newcomers to the medium and can often serve as a gateway drug for the comic book world.  If you don't \\"get\\" comic books, you will start to \\"get it\\" after reading this.

B001MEJY8W|4.0|I rarely watch horror films, the only series ive ever watched through are the saw series because i had to follow the storline through to the end to see what happened and try to guess the plot twists before they happened. I didnt even get through this 1 film the first time I watched it because it played with my head so much! This was the first film ive had to walk out on in my life, not because it was a bad film but because of how well the film makers put it togethor to do exactly that. This is definetly a challenging film for anyone who has any sense of the real world because it is so believable. This is a good film and the plot, characters and performances deserve credit.    SPOILERS: I walked out just after anna was taken in by the cult and the purpose of this seemingly mindless torture when it became clear that she being the main character would be going that extra stage that none of the other test subjects had. Coincidently i had been reading a book about how thousands of modern day near death experiences, NDE's have masses in common with eachother and with accounts written in the 2'500 year old tibetan book of the dead and the 4,440 year old egyptian book of the dead. Also the reason women are more responsive to this is because they are close to the source of life since they bring it into this world and are therefore closer to next world when you leave this one, just so you understand why i found this film so realistic and effective. its details like this that made this such a memorable film for me.
B00021HBGS|4.0|The pieces are all attractively painted and include a train, plane, car, trucks and other modes of transportaion.  The track snaps together easily but doesn't conform or adhere to the walls of the tub.  My 2 1/2 year old grandson still loves the transport pieces and runs them around the sides and top of the tub creating races, crashes and sand traps.  Great for child's own imaginative play.  I would buy them as a gift for another child.
1594202842|2.0|Good Lord!  This may be the most disturbing book I have read in quite some time.     I won't spend too much time trying to figure out the point of this book.  The author clearly doesn't understand that western culture is a made up of all cultures; it's a blend of all peoples who live here now or have lived here in the past. To generalize and place all westerners into a single sweeping steroptype is foolish and dangerous.     Respect for others is a two-sided coin- fear is on one side and admiration on the other.  The trick is to find balance. Respect that relies too much on admiration can lead to one person taking advantage of the other.  Furthermore, respect that relies too much on fear can lead to hatred.  Neither is optimal.      Maybe the key to parenting is raising children with respect that includes both freedom and guidance.      Clearly, The Tiger Fear factor is not optimal.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|The library lends TV series if it has them. I borrowed the first season to see what it was like. I was reading Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series before vampires were a trend. Back when the books were funny, quirky mysteries. Janet Evanovich with vampires. There is much less humor now that the author seems to be writing more for the TV series. I watch it anyway, and still read the books.    During the first episode or two, I thought this series might not be worth watching. Teen angst, etc. I gave it another episode or two and was hooked. The plots kept getting better and more complicated. Usually, it surprises me in some way in each episode. It is scary, but not too scary for me. The music is perfect for each episode, and adds a lot to the story. There is no humor in the series, but it is appropriate.    There is still some teen angst in each episode. That is the main audience. I think. It is no longer the focal point, however, and that widened its appeal for me. I'm learning more about the vampires' back stories, as well as Elena's and Bonnie's past. I'm very glad I borrowed it.
0205191584|3.0|THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE has sat on my shelf for more years that I care to admit. I kept hearing what a wonderful little book it is, a must read for writers. Unfortunately for me that wasn't the case. On the most part I was lost. I couldn't really grasp the concepts. But what I did get out of it was worth the read. For the price and the number of pages, I recommend it to all who write.
B0042U94UQ|3.0|when i first was getting ready to write my review i was going to give it 5 stars!! i loved the movie thought it was very funny. after reading some of the lower reviews one customer made a very good point about the girls being in an orphange and the box of shame. and i totally agree now. even though i still like this movie i dont think children in an orphange is something to poke fun at. i know it is just a cartoon but stuff like that does actually happen and its sad.
B002W1GCX4|5.0|Whilst the multiple (yet varied) recordings of different songs are wanted by the quintessential Bowie collector, where does this place your run-of-the-mill rock fan? That's what I'm here to answer.<br /><br />Those of you who are already Bowie fans will appreciate this plunge into the past as you get a chance to see that which was formative in his later, much more widely known career as the charismatic entertainer; Ziggy Stardust, a glowing beacon among other subdivisions of his personality and style. For others, it will be a trip down memory lane as you are reacquainted with the old music hall style of music.<br /><br />However, this album is not merely a hallmark of a bygone time, as it faces up to the demons of yesterday and tomorrow in the form of the very real issues of sexual leaning and identity. The album has a very jaunty, jovial feel overall (with the marked exception of \\"Please, Mr. Gravedigger) which only lends power to the message which is laced within it. It paints a sad picture of the fate of the non-conformist, whilst maintaining an energetic and unexamined veneer which belies the earnest truth within.<br /><br />All in all, the tracks translate with clarity and no disambiguation over to the 21st century from their 60's setting, poignantly refreshing the everyday soundtrack of an average life, and displaying a sliver of the inspired young artist which Bowie once was, and remains today.<br /><br />Every listen reveals a new wealth of meaning, which I shall allow you to uncover for yourself.<br />Most importantly, the album is immensely enjoyable, as it manages to lift spirits with its cheerful demeanour, whilst remaining un-flippant in its delivery as it tells the enduring story of the sublime innocence which encapsulates youth as it is peeled back to reveal the exclusion of differences and yearning for conformity.
0385342039|4.0|My mom bought me this book over a year ago and it's just been sitting on my nightstand waiting 2 be read so i started last friday and i found it utterly riveting - i couldn't put it down - yes it was far fetched but it was also too funny so that compensates the only thing that bugged me after i read it was -  she had lied  Sadie about her boyfriend wanting 2 become a scientist and opening a zoo which means that Sadie had never put it right... so if you are compelled 2 listen 2 her and do what she says then what happened to him because she obviously never fixed him lol - maybe i'm overanalyzing - anyway great book i would recommend it 2 anyone
B00005K9LK|5.0|I could never get sick of this album! I could play it over and over again. This right here is one of my favorite albums of all time. The dual attack of tipton and downings guitars are amazing and heavy. Judas priest in my eyes are one of the best heavy metal artists of all time. Buy this right now it wont disappoint.
B004DK5CYM|4.0|FILM RATING: 4 stars<br /><br />Since I first heard about this film, I've wanted to see it. The story of Secretariat is legendary and epic...the stuff for a potentially great movie. And Director Randall Wallace came through on this one. On first viewing, the story struck me as a bit too PG and \\"Disney-fied\\", but as I've watched several times since, I appreciate some nuances that at first blush passed me by. So I've upgraded my initial rating of 3.5 stars to 4. The film has an emotional depth and maturity that I think will hold up well over the years.<br /><br />Secretariat is the story of the famed horse that won the Triple Crown in 1973 (the year I was born ironically), winning the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes all in a row in a single year. It's also the story of the horse's owner, Penny Chenery Tweedy, played very well by Diane Lane. In supporting roles, John Malkovich, Margo Martindale, and Nelsan Ellis help make the story of the people behind the horse interesting. Secretariat is the most famous racing horse to this day, and no horse has repeated yet as a Triple Crown winner in over 37 years. Who knows...maybe this movie will inspire a new Triple Crown winner this year!<br /><br />Set in the late 1960's and early 1970's, Secretariat brings that time period and the world of horse racing to life just like Seabiscuit (2003) did a few years ago...and like The Black Stallion (1979) did when I was a kid. I personally think Secretariat is a little better than Seabiscuit, but both are really good horse racing films. I haven't seen The Black Stallion in a lot of years, so I'm not sure how I would rate it cinematically, but I remember I loved it as a kid! Disney and director Wallace made a film here that is accessible to a broad range of audiences like the other two films I mentioned. That both helps the film and hurts it. By making a PG film, Wallace and Disney don't quite give the film the edginess it needs to propel in to the cinematic hall of fame, but kids today now have a new story about horse racing that they can cling to and come to appreciate like I did with The Black Stallion. I've always loved horses in movies, and Secretariat reminds me of the simple joys of watching a horse race, like I did a few times as a teenager with my parents.<br /><br />What strikes me more than anything about Secretariat is the cinematography by legendary Director of Photography Dean Semler. He is truly one of the greatest cinematographers of all time, bringing us unforgettable images in Dances With Wolves (1990), Dead Calm (1989), Apocalypto (2006), We Were Soldiers (2002), and Appaloosa (2008)...to name a few. Semler really went outside his normal camera box with Secretariat, using images from all sorts of resources, including small digital cameras in addition to 35mm film. One of the special features on the Secretariat Blu-ray discussed some of the photography during the horse races, which fascinated me as a photographer and filmmaker. Semler uses small digital cameras to capture some fascinating images of the horses and the races up close and personal, giving us an up-close and personal look at  horse racing like we've never seen. Kudos to Semler and Wallace for daring to look outside of just the standard horse racing images we've seen before and bringing a fresh take to this sub-genre of movies. The photography definitely gives this film at least 1 of it's stars because it is so striking compared to the average film.<br /><br />Production Design by Thomas E. Sanders and Art Direction by Sarah Boardman and Naaman Marshall really shines in Secretariat as well. With so many well designed productions these last few years, we seem to take these talented film team members for granted, but I for one really appreciate all the hard work they put into getting all the details of the sets, locations, costumes, make-up, and props just right. The magic of film is that when its done right (like here), you are transported toanother world, another time, and another place. If something distracts you from the believability of that escape, then it doesn't work as well. But the production design of Secretariat is spot on, supporting and enhancing the story, as it should.<br /><br />While the true test of Secretariat will be how it holds up over the next decade, it's definitely a film for the whole family. Kids and adults alike can find something here to grab on to. If there was more of a male lead character that I could strongly relate to, this story might be stronger for me. But getting in to Penny's shoes for 2 hours is enough to make me like this film more than most. While Secretariat won't make me revise my Top 10 films of 2010, it's probably in the 11-20 range. 2010 was just such a competitive year in movies that in another year, Secretariat would surely rise to the top like the horse itself did in 1973. Now I have a film to remind me of what was truly great about the year I was born...other than me being born of course!her place.

I asked for help from the company and a week later I still didn't get a reply. I also asked for help in many other places and didn't get any. Maybe my computer isn't compatible?

B000002INJ|4.0|In the long history of heavy metal there have been many,many strange bands, with outrageous behavior, ideas and style. But none of them are as serious about their particular style than Manowar. i do not know if there is a classification as viking metal but if there is they are the best by a mile. Did they watched  Conan the Barbarian way too many times? Possibly. Is their music full of violence and bloodshed? You bet. But that cannot and do not takes away from the fact that these guys are talented and they enjoy what they do. Silly ? Maybe. Powerful? No doubt about. Is an experience. All hail the kings of metal!

The amount of information on the cards are perfect.
0802473156|5.0|For most men, this is a really helpful, really easy to read book that confirms much of what you probably already know.  The most helpful part of the book is the short quiz that you can take at the end of the book.  There is also a test that your spouse (or lover) can take.  Then, you can compare scores and realize (or discover) what words/acts of love are important to you (and to her!)  I suggest that both of you take the quiz before reading descriptions of the different love languages.  Unfortunately, most of us have learned to look for the \\"best answer\\" in a test.  Instead, you each have an opportunity to be brutally honest as to how you really behave.  Then, you can learn how one or more of the five love languages will enable you to become a better lover.
B003O85W3A|5.0|This album gives the feeling of the Beatles' Abbey Road album. Emotionally not as powerful as Funeral, but the pieces are constructed amazingly well to create a different kind of uniqueness. But, what made the Arcade Fire unique is still there. Subtle shaped melodies, strong beats integrated into soft pieces to create a striking and balanced flow. Repeating the same structure over and over again, each time with a different melody. Occasionally presenting the listener with strongly captivating tunes, in, for instance, Ready to Start (the synth seduction) and Suburban War (the drum seduction).    For an album, rating may refer to a lot of different things. In my case, it refers to the enjoyment quality. And, in that aspect, this album gets a perfect score. Suggested to anyone who is interested in listening to albums that has the power to shape a genre.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have literally read hundreds and hundreds of books. So many, that I must  track them on an Excel spreadsheet to remind me if I have read something or not.  Having said that, this ranks at or very near the best of the best.    We recently lost our 16 year old lab mix and it was a gut wrenching experience. Now, after completing Stein's book, I have a whole different insight on what it is like to be a dog.  I know this is a work of fiction, but it still brought me to a different perspective.    I wholeheartedly endorse this as a book that will take you  to many different levels of humun emotional experiences. what a wonderful ending!  Enzo is a hero.
0375701427|4.0|Essentially, American Pastoral is an etiology, a study of the causes of disease. In American Protagonist Swede Levov spends his life trying to determine the cause of the disease that claimed his daughter, made her a murderer and turned her into a nut, and this becomes an allegory for whatever it is that undermines the American promises of prosperity, civic order and domestic bliss.    Maybe that sounds boring or depressing.  However, I think American Pastoral is an excellent book. It's a compelling read that builds with surprising momentum, even though we know what happens from the start. It's a long book, and the sentences and paragraphs sometimes go on for days, but the ones that do are often the most affecting.  Roth can turn a very sharp phrase, but, in the end, it's not his ability to put words together that stays with the reader, it's their emotional impact: the intense sense of loss and futility, anguish and rage, and the desperation of the main character's attempt to hold himself together.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I very much enjoyed this purchase. While i had already seen the film a couple times in the past it was very nice to have a physical copy of the movie. If you want to watch a good Movie you can't go wrong with Princess Mononoke.<br /><br />GOLD STAR A+

B004EQAVHI|4.0|I thought this was a finely crafted, beautifully realized film. Having said that, it's also one of the most horrifying films I've ever seen. I found it severely depressing.  Though I believe that I fully understood the underlying themes and the inherent message about fully living the life you've been given, I still get very angry when I think about this film.      The problem is that while I see the underlying 'truth' of the film, it also made me feel like there's absolutely no point at all to life. I walked away from this movie feeling like society is a cancer and that we should all just go ahead and kill ourselves. I know. I know. That wasn't the point, but still...     In summary, it's hard not recognize the artistry of this film, but I still regret having seen it. It left me feeling I had a cancer that I couldn't get out of my body and that all of life is damned.      Life is already hard enough. Who wants to carry the added burden of feeling like it's completely pointless too?
0321525655|4.0|This is a wonderful book. Describes in a lucid style and with exaples how to make a really good presentation.

No matter which browser I try (and I tried them all) they just won't draw anything on the canvas.  Furthermore there's no errata or any place to post questions on the books web site.    DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!    You will learn nothing because the examples don't work.    I was going to sell this to a used book store, but I don't want to inflict it on anyone else, so I think I'll just throw it in the nearest dumpster.

The 3d affects were awesome! This movie is a great buy whether  in 3d or not, but what they've done to it in 3d, makes you feel like you are actually touching the characters as if they are in the same room with you. The plot is great! Everything from start to finish was awesome. I won't give details about the exacts of the movie cause I hate when people do that to me before I'm able to see the movie. I've watched it 3 times already and it's still as intriging as it was the first time I watched it.

B000F1IQNC|5.0|Sometimes I just need to have a talk with myself. How can I rate the propaganda of \\"Unthinkable\\" with the quietly moral and charming values of \\"Nanny McPhee\\"? Worse, how dare I? Pointedly, \\"Nanny McPhee\\" is one of those movies you want to buy to have on hand for company in case they feel like a good old-fashioned, happily-ever-after story. Truly, if there is really a happy ending, this film provides it.<br /><br />Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) is this most unattractive woman who works as a nanny. Admittedly, I missed the first 20 minutes and don't know why her face is rife with warts and one protruding tooth and one long eyebrow and somewhat amorphous body. Why she looks this way and then another way by the end of the story is a magical occurrence I cannot explain (because I missed the beginning). I can assert that she administers discipline with a calm voice and stalwart presence. Each of the rules she successfully teaches results in the disappearance of a facial wart or other.<br /><br />Basically, the story line is simple: Mr. Brown (Colin Firth) loses his wife (she dies). They have seven children, his job does not make enough money to support his vigorous brood, and his wife's old maid aunt (Angela Lansbury) supports the family in jolly ol' Victorian England. She orders him to marry by the end of the month so that his children will have a mother (never mind what kind he might get). The only handy one--in his class--it is Victorian England--is a widow. But, yikes, this woman is long in the tooth and randy to boot.<br /><br />Of course, there's the sweet, young thing, the scullery maid--not of his class--who becomes the adopted daughter of this aunt--you know, to lessen the brood count at Mr. Brown's house. Is it OK to take a child (actually, she is an adult, but the aunt has terrible eyesight)? Yes, if you're rich enough, and two, if it is Victorian England. If Mr. Brown doesn't marry, his children could end up in the workhouse like Dickens characters of the same time period.<br /><br />All the while Nanny McPhee \\"arranges\\" things, but cannot force things. The most clever part in Emma Thompson's script is allowing the children freedom to find within themselves the resources to mend their own lives.<br /><br />It's a lovely story, filled with life, love, and laughter--and troubles, problem-solving, cues, and miscues, but, best of all, learning to take responsibility and accept people based on their character, not their looks.while Nanny McPhee \\"arranges\\" things, but cannot force things.

The book tries to communicate through the use of quite remarkable real life examples from Nazi concentration camps, the lesson that life holds a potential meaning under any conditions whatsoever, even the most misarable ones. it teaches that we must always say YES to life in spite of all tragic aspects of human existence.<br /><br />A psychology classic worth reading by anyone.

0061726826|5.0|Set in a not-too-distant future, Lena Holoway can't wait until the operation that will remove any possibility of being infected by the disease amor deliria nervosa. Lena is fairly unique amongst her peers in that she's always tried to suppress her emotions, feeling incredible shame after her mother, immune to the operation and hopelessly emotional, abandoned her and left her in the care of her aunt, a disapproving and fussy woman. Lena completely buys all the propaganda that experiencing falling in love will only cause heartache in the end. Her older sister also proved an embarrassment by falling in love and provoking an emotional display when it came her turn for the operation. Lena secretly worries that because of her family history she may be more susceptible to hysteria and loss of reason than most. There are little hints and clues that all is not as tranquil as one might guess, however. The fact that Lena's best friend Hana also expresses her doubts about the operation, and that Lena stumbles upon an active, forbidden nightlife scene is a sure sign that she's not as aberrant as she thinks.<br /><br />The book has a very strong sense of place. If you're going to set a novel in a dystopian, carless future, Portland, Maine is the perfect locale. Situated on a peninsula of the rocky southern Maine coast, it's a very compact, walkable, beautiful oceanside city full of notable landmarks. It was really fun to recognize all of the street names and landmarks that Oliver uses. Munjoy Hill, Back Cove, The Eastern Promenade, Old Port, Congress St., Fore St., Deering Oaks Park. I wondered why Longfellow Square was so conspicuously absent... until it's revealed much later in the story, that in this world, poetry has been banned.<br /><br />When Lena bombs the personality test administered to all young adults, she gets a rare second chance; the facility was victim of a prank by protestors who let loose a herd of cattle into the auditorium, invalidating her results. She also rather fatefully meets a mysterious young man, Alex, who turns out to be an undercover operative from the resistance. He hasn't undergone \\"the cure\\" and is able to show her that maybe falling in love isn't such a bad thing after all. The two of them enjoy several steamy make-out sessions, made all the more enticing by their forbidden allure, as Lena struggles to decide what she will do. The two of them leave messages for each other, hidden in a statue on Monument Square.<br /><br />I had many questions about how things came to be in their current state. Did a group of heartbroken people initially agree to have the operation and then impose the cure by force on others? In a world where all of the adults have rendered themselves emotionally flat, would that lend an even stronger intensity to childhood friendships? Portland is kind of a far-flung city - where's the center of government? Who's benefitting from all of this? Do people work harder and more productively when they don't love their families? There's plenty of thought devoted to the excitement and rush of young love, and parental love is also mentioned in the book. I was surprised that more people weren't actively fighting back. I also wanted to throttle Lena at times, as she deliberately put her head in the sand for a good portion of the book, and took a long time to slowly and carefully make her decisions, but given her background, perhaps it was understandable. This was an amazing book, one that lived up to my every expectation.

B004BLJQOK|4.0|I watched the original, then this version, then I read the book.  I found that the two movie versions were very similar and I enjoyed both versions.  The acting was not \\"Oscar\\" winning performances, but the young actors in both versions were great and made the characters believable.  I also found the \\"controlled\\" vampire refreshing.  Not seeing a vampire losing control at the mere sight of a neck to bite on gave the store a real chance.     The one thing that I noticed was that I was asking a lot of questions about the characters and their thoughts and reasoning.  This is where the book came in.  It really dealt deeper into the story under the story and answered some character questions.  It tied all the loose ends for me.    I enjoyed all three and would recommend each.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I got this to upgrade my Rocket Fish Universal CPU Cooler. It is WAY better than it and was about the same price (I bought it at Best Buy). I am very happy with this cooler and the BEST thing I like is that it has a 120mm fan (I also got another 120mm fan for the other side). All together I have (7) 120mm fans [1 is blue led] and also a rear blower (blue led). The Cooler Master Hyper 212+ makes a wonderful addition to my rig. My rig is a little noisy but thats what to expect when dealing with so many fans. It keeps my rig nice and cool. The contact plate is very flat unlike the Rocket Fish Universal CPU cooler. This is a wonderful investment. I would highly recommend this cooler.
B004NSVF7C|4.0|Though I read this book a while ago and cannot recall many of the details, I can recall identifying with John Gilkey -- the book thief.  If you are the type of person who scoffs at the notion of an e-reader and who must feel and even smell the pages of a book (not in the creepy kind of way you're imagining), and who would rather give away your 60\\" plasma TV than to let your best friend borrow a book you finished long ago (because the idea of letting someone borrow a book makes you moderately uncomfortable), you will find a small comfort here.  Those of us who find satisfaction in acquiring a stack of new books the way an addict finds satisfaction in attaining that next high will understand Gilkey.  Few of us will condone his methodologies for feeding his addiction (clever though they may have been), but we may very well understand the motivation behind it all.  This addiction -- as the writer points out-- distinguishes itself from many others because it is accompanied by a feeling of elevated social stature (such feelings do not accompany crack and alcohol addictions and the like).  Overall, I enjoyed the story told here and it made me curious about John Gilkey.  Oddly, there is not much information about him on the Net. On a separate note, I am glad the desire to purchase first edition classics died down after a while.

0756404738|3.0|Warning: Spoilers. Read at your own risk.<br /><br />Like many of the reviewers here, I loved The Name of the Wind. Absolutely loved it. I bought it one day on a whim and it's made its way right up there with A Storm of Swords by George R.R. Martin as a near-perfect example of what a fantasy novel should be. It's no surprise then that I waited for The Wise Man's Fear with much bated breath and high expectations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for a book that's nearly 1,000 pages long, not a whole lot happens here. That's my biggest gripe with the book. Too much of the book is spent detailing Kvothe's adventures after leaving the University, but none of it seems terribly significant for the time spent telling it. The chapters about his time with Felurian especially dragged on. As I was reading through it, I flipped a few pages and to my horror there was another 50 or so pages of this. Everything that happened in those pages could have been condensed to a couple of chapters.<br /><br />As for the pages spent hunting bandits, I actually enjoyed that more than most reviewers here it seems, though the abrupt shift from the university to Vintas to the forest wasn't done too well. It was far too sudden and Kvothe left the university, the main setting of almost the entire last book, in a manner of pages with no farewells or fanfare. That nagged at me for quite a while, until I finally settled into the new setting of hunting bandits in the forest, only to have it happen again, only to come all the way around to where we started out.<br /><br />The book seems to be more a series of short stories with no common thread to tie them together than a proper story. There's almost no driving force in this book. Before it was doing research on the Chandrian. Everything Kvothe did stemmed from his desire to learn more about them for killing his family and troupel For being such a main focus in the first book, as they should have been, they're barely given a few mentions here. They seemed to have been put on the backburner in favor of court politics and hunting down bandits, which I'd be okay with if the main plot progressed at all, but it didn't. (More on that briefly).<br /><br />Another category where this book seems to fare worse than it's predecessor is in the handling of secondary characters. Mainly Denna. Now I'll be blunt. I hate Denna. I hate everything about her character and here's why. She's static. Since her first appearance in the first book until the end of this one, she is essentially still the same, boring character. She has not changed one iota from then until now except for getting beat around by her pimp (Sorry, patron).<br /><br />This book could've done so much more in terms of plot and character development, but instead we follow Kvothe to some foreign lands and back home. Speaking of secondary characters, what ever happened to Ambrose? He had a few pivotal scenes in the first book, but he's hardly to be seen in this one. For being built up basically to the the book's antagonist, he sure doesn't have much screen time. He's talked about more than you actually see him it seems. Now I'm sure you're thinking \\"Of course you don't see Ambrose anymore, Kvothe moved on! The story progressed!\\" And yet, the second book ends quite literally where it started, both in the present day and in Kvothe's story. What really changed in those 1,000 pages? 1,000 pages and we've come full-circle to the start. I could stomach that if at least the characters had been developed somehow, but other than Kvothe becoming a man-whore who'll screw anything that moves, not a whole lot has changed. Sure he played some court politics and screws Felurian, but he's essentially in the same place that he was at the beginning, albeit with a heavier purse. For being 1,000 pages, that's inexcusable.<br /><br />This book simply spent way, way too much time on Kvothe (Who, strangely enough, I found much more interesting in the first book) and not enough time on Kvothe's friends and rivals, and next to no significant information regarding the Chandrian and the Amyr. Why is that? Why are nearly 70 pages spent detailing Kvothe's time with Felurian? I don't mind a short story interjected in the story if it's done well and kept brief like they were in the first book. I loved the bit about Tehlu binding Encanis to the iron wheel, or the story of Lanre. It's minor but it's things like that which flesh out a world and give fantasy titles believability. The whole thing with Felurian would've been fine if it were a chapter or two, but 70 pages? Over 200 pages of walking around in the woods hunting bandits? Seriously? Not once in the first book did I think anything I was reading was included just to be padding, but I felt that a few times in this book so far.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is a bad book, though my review may seem pretty scathing. It's still a good read and perfectly readable for the first 1/3 or so, but there's just too much pointless wandering that doesn't really add anything to the story or provide any answers regarding the Chandrian, who at this point we really don't know much more about than we did by the end of the first book, and to rub salt in the wound, we get a brief glance at Haliax while they're hunting bandits and just like that he's out of the picture again. This book simply needed to be taken to the cutting block and trimmed down heavily, as well as include SOMETHING to keep the main plot going. Again, it's a decent book, but it had massive shoes to fill after The Name of the Wind and it didn't succeed in that regard. It's a decent book that could've been great with some honest editing and more focus on the main story instead of these little misadventures which don't amount to much in the grand scheme of things.on regarding the Chandrian and the Amyr.

B0043D2DIM|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has a beautiful way of telling a story. I loved the university scenes and his science based magic system is very original. I can't wait to read the next installment. This is a long book but well worth the time.
1439190275|3.0|The book is ok but I like the old one best.  Dr. Atkins first book was, for me, a better guide to loosing weight.
1401223176|3.0|Because of all the hype I was expecting a bit more. The story is concise and keeps moving forward, but sometimes it is just that, no major twist or surprises. Being a Jim Lee fan since his days in Uncanny X Men I very much appreciated his art, but to be truthful I would have appreciated a more realistic art for this book, or to have had the whole book in his sketched up style (ala Deathblow) would have been amazing and different. Overall is a good read and plenty nice to look at.
B0041KKYD8|2.0|It's easy to review this movie, especially after seeing the highly controversial original from Meir Zarchi. Why? Because it's just a version for a large audience, as predictable as possible, when the original was only for adults! See this: Camille Keaton (grand-niece of Buster Keaton) was 31 when she starred in Zarchi's 1978 almost no-budget original, which came out when rape and revenge storytelling was anything but fashioned. Sarah Butler was 24 when she starred in the remake. So? The mature, aristocratic female in the original has been replaced with a little tease, escaped from the worst TV series and who moves and speaks and dresses up like any common student. She's silly enough to get lost when she has a map (and works for a magazine lol) so she has to ask around for her way. Bad luck, the guy who gives her the info is the same one who'll fall down on her later, with his mates. Predictable? You got it! In the original, Jennifer doesn't ask for her way to the cabin so we never know who will fall down on her and how - we call this suspense. When it happens, it's surprising because it's in daytime, on a river. Totally unexpected. In the remake, it's different (at night, inside her cabin!) but we can see everything coming right away, very quickly, especially after the camcorder precision. No suspense!    The rape scenes (two in a row, instead of three in the original) are shocking but they totally lack the cold realism of the original, thanks to - or because of? - Jennifer who keeps weeping like a baby, and the shaking camera. The filmmakers (like most horror directors today) say goodbye to style and cold realism, they do nothing else but shoot from one angle to another and use frantic editing that makes everything, even the simulated sexual moves, look desperately flat. So flat that the film can be followed with the sound off. The movie tries to surprise without managing to do it - it's not the goal after all -, especially with that sherif who passes for honest but happens to be as degenerate as the others, even more since he has a family. The film starts to be interesting only after Jennifer jumps in the river and mysteriously disappears, in front of the thugs (how could she stay totally out of sight for so long?) but Monroe, the director, wastes everything with plans taken from \\"Ring\\" as she brutally re-appears in a ghost-like way, with her long black hair partly hiding her face, then from the \\"Saw\\" series as she takes on the thugs one after another. She always does the same thing, taking them by surprise and knocking them down, preferably from behind, so they wake up in the most uncomfortable positions ever. It's such a piece of cake for her that the movie loses all of its interest - it didn't have much so far - from the moment we catch her revenge method. She looks to much like Shawnee 'Amanda' Smith in the \\"Saw\\" series to be totally convincing. Thing is, unlike Amanda in \\"Saw\\", Jennifer hasn't been showed and taught anything about torture 'art', so what the film shows can be described as impossible.    Many people say that the revenge scenes in Zarchi's original are poorly executed, maybe because they didn't satisfy their needs and thirst for 'voyeurism' at a time when image and real TV shows have invaded everything. I personally found them shocking - especially the scene in the bathtub, which has been removed for the remake and replaced with very common, predictable torture stuff. The thug is chained to the ceiling when Jennifer cuts his thing off (too easy!), when he's not in the original - she sexually manipulates him. Apparently the lesson hasn't been taken. And where do all those ropes and chains and perfectly cut pieces of wood come from anyway? Why does she need to use all this crap? How can she show so much ingenuity and cleverness during her revenge when she looks so traumatized? On the whole this movie is violent of course but that's all, it's shocking but grotesque at the same time, the revenge scenes are repetitive and go uselessly way too far. I saw it just after the original so it never surprised me when the original did.    If you want to be surprised, there are way better films around - notably some from the 70's-80's-90's. Today the fashion is to remakes with no intention to surprise anybody, just to allow us to see as many things as possible without thinking too much. The 'I Spit On Your Grave' original was cold, decent and new for its time, this remake is just exploitation of violence for the masses. Not to be recommended.

B0000DZ3DR|5.0|For a final studio release, I have to say that this album didn't get a fair shake from the label who signed Gene and Carla, yet it is understandable with his reputation for not liking to tour and all his substance abuse-related behavior.  Sad for geniuses like this man, because they always seem to be self-destructive.  Still, in lieu of it all, this is a great way to go out.<br /><br />A great folk-country-pop album that showcases Gene as a man who still has what it takes and introduces Carla Olson of the Textones to a marginally wider audience.  Their harmonies are surprisingly good, considering Carla sounds so much like Carlene Carter at times that it's spooky.  She contributes good songs here, particularly \\"Every Angel in Heaven\\" and \\"The Drifter,\\" but it's Gene's poetic and beautifully haunting songs that really hold all the appeal here.  \\"Gypsy Rider\\" is pure country biker genius, and \\"Del Gato,\\" co-penned with brother Rick, is speechlessly awe-striking poetry.<br /><br />There are a lot of great covers here, such as Burrito Bros.' \\"Hot Burrito #1,\\" and John Fogerty's \\"Almost Saturday Night,\\" a surprising number for Gene to tackle given his penchant for melancholy.  The real treasures here are the remakes of \\"Don't it Make You Wanna Go Home\\" and, most stunningly, Phil Ochs' \\"Changes,\\" which is very Byrds-sounding and so akin to Gene's style of poetry that I had to check the credits twice to make sure it wasn't to his credit!<br /><br />This is a wonderful album, even if Carla's voice takes some getting accustomed to, but if you want a great folk-country-pop outing that doesn't sound forced and pretentious, this is a very worthwhile one to acquire.  God, bless you wherever you are, Gene.  We miss you!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I wouldnt consider myself a religious person but Id like to think that if God had an ipod this would be on his playlist. When listening to Sigh No More in general it makes me want to close my eyes and take it all in, which could be bad when you are listening and driving. Its clean cut and brutally uplifting. Songs like \\"The Cave\\" \\"Winter Winds\\" and \\"Dust Bowl Dance\\" seem like the type to change your whole perspective on life. Marcus Mumfords raspy, but yet somewhat angelic voice brings it all together along with the big bass and dobro(sounds like the banjo). Needless to say Im already waiting on the sophomore album...along with the residents in heaven.
1843106698|5.0|My husband and I were saddened and amazed at what we learned from this book.. Sad because it \\"fit\\" so perfectly and the realization that your child has a disorder of any kind is heartbreaking.  Yet, we are grateful to learn that with consistent kindness, love, encouragement, and coaching, an Aspergers child can live a pretty normal life and show off some amazing characteristics and talents that truly makes them extraordinary human beings! This book is so well written and just packed full of mind-blowing discoveries into the world of Aspy kids. It is only the second book we've read on this subject but it's a definite winner and one you'll want to read over and over. We're now excited to learn more and embrace the journey of raising and enjoying our wonderfully brilliant teen-aged son!
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|movie was well made.  the actors did a good job.  I can recommend this film to just about anyone.
0316098337|3.0|The idea of a novel written from a child who's never known anything but captivity--because his mother was abducted and imprisoned for years in a private gaol--is fascinating, as we've all read accounts of such actual crimes recently uncovered in Austria, the U.S. and elsewhere. What would the child's experience be like? What would hers be? Even more, when released would their experience of the outside world be as disorienting, even destructive as that of famous historical captive Kaspar Hauser?    Ergo \\"Room\\" has a great premise, but it's far from a great novel. Our five-year-old protagonist Jack's narrative voice is mostly waaaaaay too sophisticated for his age. Mom emerges as just a partially-realized character, their captor completely under-realized. These are all deliberate, schematic authorial decisions, but they don't ultimately serve suspense or character development. We never wholly believe \\"Jack's\\" voice, but the author's use of that as her POV means the larger pictures of invasive media attention, overall psychological impact, etc. etc. are kept at a distance that's insufficiently depthed yet simultaneously too precisely observed for a five-year-old. If you're going to tell a story through a character voice, you have to be true to what that character might credibly think. \\"Jack\\" is simply way too precocious.    Obviously, Mom's viewpoint would have been the more dramatic one. I can respect the author's decision to avoid that, but as her psychological adjustments--from captivity to liberated joy to understandable freakout--are so much more complex, grasping them second-hand is a real disappointment. We never get a real grip on her pre-kidnap life, her thorny relationship with relatives, or her post-escape fragility. Of course that's largely because Donahue stays true to her chosen POV. But too often \\"Room\\" feels like a great story just fractionally told. It ends without much satisfaction.
B004EK91LQ|3.0|I enjoyed the dance scenes. I was not crazy about the story line. The last two installments were better in my opinion.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|I believe the most critical point in this move takes place when Owen discovers a set of pictures of Abby and a kid who in many ways looks similar to the man who takes care of her - only younger, much younger. We then understand the meaning of the words \\"I've been twelve for a very long time\\". At this point, Owen had to make the choice of his life: to choose the companionship, safety, and understanding he receives from a very dangerous source, knowing well that it may have to be a lifelong commitment to Abby, or continue with his life of loneliness. Kids are very impressible at this young age - and Owen, whose parents are divorcing, and is bullied at school, is no exception. He is the nice kid who gets involved with the \\"wrong crowd\\" - because no other crowd was truly interested in him.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out on July 16th and I walked out of the movie theater knowing I had just seen a masterpiece in film-making. I couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd so my wife and I saw it two more times in the movie theaters. When it did come out and dvd and blu-ray I was a little nervous about how it would translate, since this movie is absolutely spell-binding on the big screen. Luckily, I found that this film was just as captivating at home as it is in the megaplex. I honestly cannot stop thinking about how great this movie is. It actually makes most other movies look and feel like a bit of a disappointment in comparison. Anyway, great film. I highly recommend INCEPTION.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this cd but this was the best purchase ever. Adele has the most beautiful voice and I love the words to the songs. I got the CD on Friday and haven't stopped playing it yet. You will not regret this purchase.
0756404738|3.0|To put it in the most succinct summary possible: Rothfuss failed to deliver in this second installment. As many have already mentioned, when the dialogue slipped into conversations of birth-control, STD's, and the specific belief of what sperm does exactly... (I kid you not, this is actually a part of the story. A small but appalling part) I wanted to throw the book out the window. His writing is brilliant as ever, but he really messed up and I seriously wonder if he could possibly recover from it.    To sum up even more so: I used to think this was an epic romance fantasy. And I was sadly mistaken. Perhaps that's my fault, but I just want others to know not to make the same mistake. The romance dies in this book - dies, buried, done. But it's nearly as epic as Name of the Wind, so I can still give it three stars.

B004FGMV0W|4.0|First of all, I have always though that Avril Lavigne is, beyond the poppie image sha has carried with since the release of her 1st album, a very talented girl who showed the world how good she could compose music with most of the songs of \\"Let go\\" (2002) and then she proved that on greater songs with \\"Under my skin\\" (2004). Unfortunely with the release of \\"The best damn thing\\" (2007) that wasn't seen at all and instead of a clever Lavigne singing about real stuff we were there to check out an album that was TOO commercial to enjoy and TOO shaped into the whole \\"selling out\\" thing. Honestly I was hoping because of that that \\"Goodbye lullaby\\" (2011) were an album that brought us back to that clever Lavigne trying to define the world around her in her own terms and it actually did but not quite yet.<br /><br />The songs here sound more like Lavigne finding herself again with the kind of music she began making when she was a younger girl and it's great that she did it this way but still, there's something about the songs that makes me feel uncomfortble and that take away the feel of some of them. Those samplers that try to make the songs pumping and beating is not something that at least me as singer would've liked to include in most of this album. Here's why... I think that the music industry is not letting Lavigne be who she really wants to be. I think that eventhough she's still too young to make an \\"American idiot\\" (Green day) album or an \\"Automatic for the people\\" (R.E.M.) album she has enough talent to come up with her own masterpiece any day now (certainly that's not the case with \\"Goodbye lullaby\\" but this one is an approach to who she can really be). Songs like \\"Wish you were here\\" (my personal favorite so far), \\"Push\\", \\"Everybody hurts\\" and \\"Remember when\\" sound like a real girl struggling with her own issues (no matter the cliches people have talked about). On the other hand, there are some songs here that I feel are cut with the same scissors than others therefore you can't distiguish from one another: \\"Not enough\\", \\"Darlin\\" and \\"4 real\\" are ok but they do not stand on their own like the ones I mentioned before. Now, I have to say that the songs that really proves what Lavignes is able to do in this record are \\"Alice\\", \\"Black star\\" and \\"Goodbye\\". Although anyone would say that they're not the best songs on the album they are for sure well received with the orchestra arrangements and the piano notes all mixed up with Lavigne's still naive but beautiful voice. As far as \\"What the hell\\" is concerned (the 1st single) well, let's just say that it is there to accomplish its tasks as the first single of the album but DOES NOT represent the album vibe at all! and I am just happy about that.<br /><br />If there's something smart for Lavigne to do on her future albums is to cut those attachments that the music industry is still putting on her arms in order for her to find the way to come up with her best album ever and I really hope that one day she becomes aware of what Michael Stipe (R.E.M.) once said about all this, \\"When it comes to the work, listen to yourself over anyone else. Take business advise, but don't let it overwhelm the work\\" Congratulations Avril for your new album:)you can't distiguish from one another: \\"Not enough\\", \\"Darlin\\" and \\"4 real\\" are ok but they do not stand on their own like the ones I mentioned before.

0061876747|2.0|The premise is OK if a tad weary- innocent hero (Adam KIncaid) accused of murder goes on the lam, meets cop, falls in love and it's kiss-kiss forever.     One is left wondering how a brilliant environmental scientist can find contentment as first a beggar and then a hospital porter as he ignores every reasonable possibility that if he left London for some obscure village he'd be safety away from his pursuers. One never finds out until several chapters later when he decides to become curious about all the attention he's receiving and all the dead bodies that trail him.    Instead, our hero Adam (with a home in Tucson, Arizona) decides to stick around in an extraordinarily dangerous environment even though he finds a new identity and a passport which offers travel elsewhere- perhaps back to Tucson or his father's home in Australia; \\"I love you Dad\\". These options seem never to be considered. From panhandler to handling bed pans apparently trumps weather science.    Adam hangs tough as required from all heroes in soaps and thrillers, managing to in fact himself become the murderer of a forlorn, drunken would-be blackmailer, while simultaneously shacked up with the cop (female) who had been chasing him. Adam also manages to destroy the reputation of an otherwise decent man while the cop, in one line only (second-last page) and without further embellishment, acknowledges she knows his true identity. Wow.    Summary- a decent writer reduced to pap. I do believe he became tired of the whole nonsensical premise and quit early. Sleep well.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|There is no question in my mind that this is not only the single best Springsteen/E Street live concert video, it is probably the best I've ever seen by anyone. This is an epic, powerful, joyous, splendid 3 hours of the power and joy that Bruce brings to rock and roll. From his covers of London Calling and Stephen Foster (yes the 19th composer of \\"Oh! Susanna\\", \\"Camptown Races\\", \\"Old Folks at Home\\" and \\"Swanee River\\") to his buoyant ode to hopes of the Irish immigrants in \\"American Land\\", he delivers. There isn't a break in the three-hour set which starts in the afternoon and ends in the darkness of evening. Of course they do BTR and an achingly beautiful version of \\"Jungleland\\" where you can hear the strain on his voice near the end of the set, the smokiness that allows you to hear his age but sung with the original phrasing, not the rushing-through-the-lyrics phrasing that we've seen for the past 10 years. The sound is impeccably mixed and the variety of the show--he does songs from \\"Working on A Dream\\" and \\"The Rising\\" that blend in now as beautifully as the classics of BTR, Darkness and The River. I love the New York live set. I love the Barcelona live set. I love Hammersmith Odeon London live set from 1975. I love the older versions before Clarence's back forced him to stop vamping and dancing with Bruce. But at this point, if I could only have one live performance of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, it would have to be this one. Get \\"London Calling: Live from Hyde Park.\\" It's remarkable.

B000JIHP88|5.0|My baby loves looking at a fan so I wanted a mobile that would be similar to that--not so much noise--just a little sound but mostly the idea of something moving continuously like a fan would. This is fantastic. Now, it does have sound but it goes low enough for baby to drift off--not like the wind-ups (sooo loud and then you have to crank them) It is very pretty to look at as well. I'm so impressed by it. Great investment. Oh and the remote is priceless. I onlyyyyy wish it would spin for a hint longer--however, it runs on batteries, so I guess the idea is it should go off at some point not to drain them and if you need it on longer you restart it.

B002OG5GT8|4.0|I am new to the world of headphone amplifiers and a friend of mine who has much more experience of being an   Audiophile recommended this little guy to start off. I received the item a few days ago and have had the chance   to play through several genres of music to finally create a simple review for those who are new like me, in terms  of headphone amplifiers and solid quality headphones.     I listen to Jazz very frequently, Rock (Deftones, Breaking Benjamin, etc.), Acoustic (William Fitzsimmons,   Bon Iver, etc.), and Spanish music (Ricardo Arjona as an example). I've been able to more or less tell   subtle differences with audio quality with this little device powering up my headphones to it's full potential.   I do not have the best heads or cans at the moment, but I am able to tell subtle differences when I have   this little device hooked up versus not having the Fiio connected to amp up the audio. My current headphones   are the Sony's MDR-V6.     I am satisfied with this device seeing that it does more than what I expected it to do, I mean for $2o   dollars you couldn't go wrong. I have noticed the \\"buzzing\\" or \\"static\\" sounds when the music is not   playing, butwhen you start a song the \\"buzzing\\" or \\"static\\" goes away. It's a minor annoyance, but I   can deal with it.    The packaging is very simple, but effective in terms of informing you as to what you are getting. Seeing   that it's made in China and the packaging or advertisements are much more simple...it's pretty straight   forward with the name of the device and the model number with \\"Headphone Amplifier\\" on the bottom front   of the box.     The Fiio E5 is sturdy, well built, and is simple to use. What I enjoyed about this device is that it   includes two aux 3.5mm gold plated cables to just hook up your headphones right from the get go. I hope   this review helps the individual who wishes to enter the world of becoming an Audiophile just like me.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I can not describe to you how excited i was to finally buy this album. It'd been in my mind since listening to Welcome to the Black Parade. Finally, after four years of anticipation I buy this and I put the cd in my player and on the first track I'm thinking...wtf. The second track goes and it's actually kind of catchy and I'm stoked with joy, loving the sound. As the album treads on I realize that the sound of WTTBP is out and the sound of Danger Days is in.  I'll admit that I was a bit disappointed that there was no dark dramatic brilliance but I've come to get over it and embrace this album. I love every track. They're fun and up beat and the lyrics are still MCR. It's still all about death and destruction, but with just more of a lighter tone to it, making it in my opinion ironic. However, there are still some tracks that have that fast rock pace that has been with MCR since they became a band. I can tell by just listening to the music and the lyrics that they had a great time making this album and I think that's what it was all about. It doesn't have the heart and soul as in WTTBP, but it's still a fabulous album to rock out to.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|Don't you get tired of that cliche line? For me all of R.E.M. albums have been good. I jumped on at Document and then bought the other 4 and proceeded to listen to those 5 albums for about a year. I was always critical of everything after that release as well it's good but those first 5. In listening to Document after a friends insistence I came back lukewarm. He said listen to it again. I came back a little more enthusiastic and he came back with listen to it again and this time I really listened and I started hearing the layering. The strength of the band is a Rickenbacker  330/360 Guitar Vox Amps, great harmony, excellent Bass and pounding drum patterns that drive the tempo. I was thinking when they lost Bill Berry, hey no big deal but if you listen to the early albums it is Berry and Mills that drive the band. Buck self admittedly is not a lead guitarist in the beginning he had just E,A,D and G chords down. But he had the tone down. So Accellerate and now Collapse Into Now succeed because they go back to what made them successful in the 1st place minus Berry(trust me he is still sorely missed) and it shows that that a 3 legged dog that plays to their strength can still put out a great album. Berry's presence is felt on this so they are a 3 1/2  legged dog. I've already listened to it more than Accellerate which is a good sign. A lot of radio friendly songs so this might be a mini resurgence of R.E.M for the spring and summer. Lets hope so
0670022411|2.0|I really was excited to read this book.  One hundred pages in, I thought any minute it would get interesting.  At four hundred pages I no longer cared.  The characters weren't even boring, they were just void.  No real personality, no great dialog, no heated sexual chemistry.  What they did have were lots of meals and the food and wine were fully described, rich in character etc..  I felt at times that I was reading a book written by someone about to fall off the over-eaters annonomous wagon.  The love of food was there, the love of characters was not.  The book could also have been about two hundred pages shorter  taken from the first 4oo pages.  I read a Nora Robert series a few years back with witches, warlocks and vampires.  Great read, entertaining characters.  Look that up.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|After discovering AWOLNATION on ThisSongIsSick.com, downloading their EP, listening to it multiple times, falling in love with it over and over, as soon as I heard that they were coming out with an album I made absolutely sure that the date was marked on my calendar. I have never anticipated an album as much as Megalithic Symphony. Of course, I love Burn It Down and Sail (personal favorite), but Kill Your Heroes is an awesome addition to their already amazing lineup. I haven't even listened to the whole album yet but I know already that it shall receive all stars.<br /><br />Megalithic Symphony is the perfect follow-up to Back From Earth. It is whimsical, gritty and original. Also, be sure to check out Innerpartysystem's remix from AWOLNATION's Back From Earth EP.<br /><br />Listen. Love. Go AWOL.
160059672X|5.0|I've been a big fan of Sherry Serafini's designs for a long time, and the beadwork in this book is fantastic: romantic and inspired with clever combinations of color and form. The instructions and illustrations are clear, and there's a nice spectrum of jewelry pieces in the projects. Even beginners will find beautiful pieces they can make in this book, and experienced beaders will also find a lot of excitement. The book is 128 pages, with instructions for bead embroidery and 25 projects, and it's being offered for an incredible price on Amazon.com. The book is its own piece of artwork, and when you consider how much classes cost these days, much less classes from a master like Sherry, it would still be an amazing bargain at several times the price. This book is magic.

B003ZK58WM|2.0|While Mr.Follett's hisorical facts held one's interest to a point he tends to get lost in wandering, picky, historical detail one third of the way thru the book where it tends to drag.  It's hard to succeed the success of Pillars and WWE.  Unions, miners, rich, poor, have all been worked over till the stories are threadbare.    Save your money and wait for his next peroid epic.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|This movie was interesting, and captivating.  Mostly because of its viking appeal, which I love.  But I have loved other movies with Sophia, and James (Kainan) reminds me of a man I know and love.  The plot mixes sci-fi with historic romance.  If you're looking for another Beowulf, this isn't it.  You can nit pick all you want about the historic inaccuracies, but understand that the movie is for entertainment.    I loved how there are easy tie ins regarding Annunaki, reptilians, and humans, as well as the quest for more 'land'.  (That will most likely go over everyone else's head).    I can see why it wasn't much of a big hit, it seems like an EXTREMELY good Sy-Fy channel movie (though its not since their brand movies are always laughable and the acting sucks).  Thats why I didn't give it 5 stars.  It isn't a Braveheart, closer to a 13th Warrior type flick.  So if you liked that, you'll enjoy this one.

0307472841|2.0|This book was reviewed very favorably on NPR, so I was pleased to pick it up in an airport yesterday. The first several chapters were thrilling, if disturbing, as we discover than substantially the entire population of a small town in Sweden has been murdered, including one young boy who did not live there but who was visiting.<br /><br />Some of the glimpses we get into the police force and the Swedish courts are interesting, and the story proceeds with some intriguing parallels to the police investigation following the murder of Olof Palme<br /><br />Warning -- some spoilers below.<br /><br />The focus then shifts  to our heroine, Judge Birgitta Roslin, whose mother had been a foster child in the house of one of the murdered families, decades ago. She investigates the crime and soon discovers the insane international plot responsible for the deaths. I don't use the word insane lightly -- it's nuts, and not credible, and Mankell is wise to reveal to the reader fairly early in the story who was responsible for the killings and why. If the story had built gradually over hundreds of pages to this absurd revelation, readers would have scoffed. Instead the story is about how Roslin discovers the absurd truth, rather than about the absurdity itself. This reduces the damage of the silly secret somewhat, but not entirely.<br /><br />The final \\"thrilling\\" section in which she is herself targeted for assassination makes no sense. It is impossible to imagine the man responsible actually taking this upon himself personally.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book.
B001UREJYK|5.0|This has been a favorite of mine since it was released. The actors are superb, the story telling is perfect, and the cinematography is amazing. While it is NOT 100% historically accurate this film is a must see for anyone who likes underdog movies or just likes a good film.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|How often can you say, this is a great product and really mean it. I got my brother and Father-in-law one of these for Christmas and they really liked it so I decided to get myself one. Works well and small enough to carry in your pocket. Safe and easy enough for a youny boy to use. Love it.
0756404738|4.0|Listen, I loved this book and read the whole 1,000 pages in two weeks, which is remarkable given my schedule.  I rate this as maybe a 3.7, but because the quality of the writing is so good I rounded up instead of down.  The problems I have with it (and yes, there are spoilers below) are based around the lack of connectivity internally within the confines of the story.  I understand that there is at least one more book to come in this series, however there are so many events in this book which we spend a tremendous amount of time engaged in, but which lead us nowhere and which seem to actually serve as a discredit to one of the most fascinating Fantasy/sci-fi characters since Ender.  For example:    - Kvothe spends months learning martial arts with the Adem and searching for the meaning of the Lethani, yet when he leaves and has this strangely tack-on adventure slaughtering the Ruh imposters, he never once looks at the event from the perspective of the Lethani and whether he used his newly found skills in accordance with the wisdom he learned.    - That time with the Adem, the final test of the stones ... could this have been a bigger dissapointment?  I know we are learning that Kvothe, despite all of his heroics, is a very flawed and over-hyped individual, but again it felt as if we spent the whole time with the Adem only to kind of wrap it up in a few quick breaths and off we go again.  Outside of him learning karate and sign-language, what was the point of it all if not to either progress his heroic story-arc or to create within himself a sense of morality which he was not able to learn from his loving parents?  The test of the stones was an utter dissapointment for me.  Throw us a bone and have him accomplish something great or just skip it.  The test literally proved nothing and advanced the character and plot-line not at all.    - The Cthaeh tells Kvothe to stay close to the Maer and when we return to Severen that whole relationship just dissolves over some bigotry.  That's it, case closed.  How can we forget what the Cthaeh told him?  Ignoring this plot point to me is indicative of many incongruities in the story as it unfolds for the reader and how it actually plays out within the story.  It was an overly abrupt ending to a long and sweeping plot line.  Truly the box with no seams was one open-ended plot line too many for me in this book.      - Things like the nobleman Kvothe plays the game with in the Maer's manor (sorry I forget his name - Bredon?).  That relationship seems to be burgeoning on mysteriously profound and again in the end kvothe just says \\"look me up sometimes\\" and off he goes.  It's hard to imagine that there wasn't more intended for this relationship.  Who was he anyway?  Now, this might come up iun book 3, but at this point of understanding of Rothfuss' style, I don't think it will be and if it is, it's one more thing too many to count on in book 3.    - The constant Ambrose like enemy everywhere Kvothe goes gets repetitious and tiresome.  I have seen others here call for an end to the Ambrose thread and I really agree - it is a holdover from Book 1 that has become something of a McGuffin.  Everywhere we go now Ambrose can be the easy spoiler, the go-to villian.  He is too much like that character Malfoy in Harry Potter and really serves as little more than a plot device for the author.  We have moved past the days of innocence in the University - Kvothe has killed dozens of people in cold blood.  Does he really still need to play pranks on Ambrose?    - Denna.  Oh Denna.  So Kvothe returns from his time with Felurian a sex God.  Okay.  Howeever, through the entirety of the Felurian scene my heart is still with Denna as I assume Kvothe's is.  I thought his time there would be in service of somehow advancing his bumbling relationship with Denna.  He goes to the Inn and practically sexes up the whole bar, but back with Denna in Imre he is back to his stuttering, stumbling self, terrified to even touchher hand.  Kvothe - ditch this chick and get with Devi already!  She is much cooler.  (Sorry, couldn't resist.)    I'm being a little tongue-in-cheek here intentionally because I have some real frustration with this book.  There is a series of amazing and engrossing adventures and I feel at a genuine loss having finished the book.  I miss this world and these characters, which is great testament to Rothfuss' talent.  Yet the third act, as it were, is a shambles, starting with the totally unnecessary adventure with the \\"Ruh Bandits.\\"  While one does not need every loose end tied up, you do get the feeling that you read a collection of adventure tales written in totallly different times and with the author in totally different frames of mind.  Almost as if he has forgotten some of the threads we were following and the conclusions we expected to be drawn.  I expected some degree, however little, of resolution in the third act but really nothing is resolved at all.  His time with the Adem, Felurian, the bandit hunting party and the Maer do not seem to have changed Kvothe one bit upon his return to the University and this is the biggest dissapointment of all.  Kvothe only becoming a swinging player is not enough.     I expected to understand the character of Kote more from reading this volume and while I can infer and project a lot onto his character, I don't think the book did a good job of expressing Kvothe's own interpretations of his experiences and connecting them to changes in behavior.  I thought Kvothe might be a little closer to Kote by the end of this, but he wasn't really changed at all.    There will be a lot of ground to cover in book 3; in my opinion, too much ground.  Things are going to get glossed over and I fear this very strong series will tarnish some as a result.  You can't knock Rothfuss because this is all springing from his mind and it is a very enjoyable series.  Perhaps the bar was set too high in The Name of the Wind, or perhaps some of the flaws that were exposed in that book's third act were brought into light as a fundamental problem in this storyline.  Perhaps this doesn't need to be limited to a trilogy at all?  Sometimes the problem with very character driven narratives is that plot points get lost.  It is our nature to try to connect the dots.  I wish Rothfuss had stepped back from the story a bit and realized that some of the connections he implies are not cannonized well enough within these thousand pages to allow the character to continue it's development. For this reason I am left feeling a little hollow where we leave off in the telling of the Kvothe story and a little concerned about the Chronicler/Bast/Kote story which is yet to unfold.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|Honestly, I would give this film negative stars if I could!!  This movie made me angry.  I literally sat in the movie theatre shaking my head throughout the entire film muttering to myself, \\"That's wrong... that's wrong.... that's wrong...\\"  The changes that the director made to this film were totally unnecessary.  As someone who ADORES these books, here are just a few of the things that bothered me.  1.  Why does Annabeth have brown hair?  *seriously, how hard is it to find a blonde actress?*  2.  Where was Clarisse?  She's a huge part of the books.  3.  Why did they have to make Riptide a clicker pen?  4.  Chiron's flanks were supposed to be white... why did they make him have brown horse hair?  5.  They wasted the first part of the movie with showing him in the water.  We find out quick enough who his dad is.  6.  Grover is supposed to have long curly hair to cover his horns.  7.  The Hydra was in the 2nd book... not the first  8.  The whole fight scene with Luke was just horrid.  The scene in the book would have been so much more effective.  9.  The search for the pearls?  Not in the book at all.... wasted time and missed out on great details in the book (like the mattress store scene)  10.  Persephone had nothing to do with his time in Hades.  11.  Hades isn't supposed to look like Hell.  It's not the same place as Christians think of.    As you can see, I have severe issues with this film.. I read this series to my students each year and they LOVE the books.... it's sad that such great books were disrespected by such a poorly made film.

B000055Y0X|5.0|This is a film that never gets old; it is a true classic. Peter Sellers is marvelous in multiple rolls. With George C Scott, Slim Pickens, and an all-star supporting cast, I was constantly entertained. So what if it is in Black and White?

B0034G4ORM|4.0|Battle: Los Angeles is a film of epic proportion. It does not settle for anything less. It has an epic John Wayne hero in Aaron Eckhart. His  character concludes that he wants to leave the service, and epically says that all the promotions and the glory was an interest of  the past. The film has an epic young Platoon leader, Lieutenant that Michael Nantz. The film has epic aliens which are so various that we often think they came from a planet which was epically advanced. So advanced that they lack the usual lobes of the brain, and ordinary organs. They have an epic Command and Control which like an elevated island. The film has epic scenes of sacrifice from a to-be father and a civilian. It has epic close-ups filled with as much emotional intensity as a McDonald's meal has calories. Aaron Eckhart looks at Corporal Jason Lockett, and epically remembers his fallen brothers information that you assume he had committed identity theft. It has an epically intriguing and well-developed hypothesis (NOT) about why the aliens are attacking the globe, and firstly Los Angeles. I may be the loner in this, but I believe they were hunting for Walt Disney's Oscars.<br /><br />Before  Staff Sargent Michael Nantz can retire, he must undergo this last mission which unlike his last, is larger than a middle eastern country-it involves the entire planet. Under young Lieutenant William Martinez, their Platoon is supposed to empty the city before the bomb raid against the belligerent aliens can begin. Unfamiliar with the enemy, obviously, this turns out to be a larger than life mission which the faith of the platoon is dependent on a handful of men.<br /><br />The first paragraph was fun to write, but it also rings true about the spirit of this movie. This film is meant to be seen on a large screen-theater or huge TV. The film maybe spends about a minute and a half giving us a half hearted hypothesis concerning the point of this invasion-from the view of a CNN correspondent. This film is visual candy. It is explosions of the highest order given to you from Jonathan Liebesman who in private must admire Michael Bay, or know that he is indebted to the master's mindless action. Like Pearl Harbor which took itself too seriously, with its clich&eacute;d dialogue that was inspirational in the fifties, I believe that Battle: Los Angeles thinks it's a love letter to the men and woman who serve selflessly, and with so much responsibilities back home are still willing to sacrifice their existence for their country and its glory. Like many similar films, this is wishful thinking. The film knows deep down it is their to entertain, and that's all it does, and does it well. Very few films can escape my writer's mind with such a minimal plot, and still make me enjoy them thoroughly. This does because of two elements: the swift, engaging action scenes, and Aaron Eckhart.<br /><br />The film knows that the key to its success are the actions sequences, and it does not disappoint. The action is swift, fun, engaging, and often believable. No superhuman emerges that can put this aliens in their place-this is not a battle of wits versus brute identifiable power. From Nantz to the civilians, everyone is lucky and fortunate to survive. The film does not hide the fact that the alien forces are superior in their arsenal, and were it not for an eventual revelation from Nantz, they would destroy us and inhabit our planet. To its most minute details, the film is realistic about the faith of our characters. Michael Nantz does not survive because he is superior to the rest of the Platoon, but besides being and courageous side, he was very lucky. So, were the rest of the survivors. However, even the men who are unlucky, pass on because of their bravery. Were it not for courage, Joe Rincon would have darted out of the alien's way, and grown old watching his son become an adult. He chose the less glamorous way, but one which showcased his selflessness in front of everyone.<br /><br />The other element is the indispensible Aaron Eckhart. On a review of Basic Instinct 2, Roger Ebert said (I'm paraphrasing) that only someone of Sharon Stone's caliber could play this cardboard seductress. In the same vain, I don't believe anyone but Eckhart could stare into the camera and deliver his lines with so much enthusiasm and seriousness. It is not often difficult to be authentic in serious drama, but when dealing with a cheesy alien invasion like this, only an absolutely phenomenal actor can pull of a good and convincing performance. Besides being emotionally suitable for the role, Eckhart disheveled look also fits a man who tired of conflict and war, is sprung into of the most barbarous military encounters. The other performances, including Michele Rodr&iacute;guezes', are also authentic, but the weight of the film is on the shoulder's of Eckhart.<br /><br />Though the film at times takes itself too seriously, deep down it knows who its out to service and entertain, and it delivers for the audience. Critics have not been harsh on this film, for there are serious gaps in the plot, to be honest. For example, the alien's reasons for invading earth is not implausible, but it so marginally discussed that one tends to believe that it seems to be taken from the first draft. However, I don't believe that the makers were oblivious to the problems, but they seem to have embraced the shortcomings. Often when filmmakers embrace underdeveloped aspects of the script, and emphasize other secondary elements, it can come off as lazy and boorish. Yet, here, the action is so well done, and the characters are so believably cheesy, that it appears like they hit their goal of entertaining the masses on a Saturday afternoon.sible Aaron Eckhart.

1935251740|4.0|I was intrigued by the premise of this book (that biology, rather than other sciences such as physics, will reveal the nature of reality). I don't have a strong background in science, but I enjoy science books that are accessible. This book can be enjoyed by scientists and lay people alike. It challenges conventional thought about the nature of the universe, consciousness, and spiritual concerns. It will \\"blow your mind\\" if you take the time to absorb the ideas. I like this kind of experience and recommend it.

B004DMIIOG|3.0|first off, amazon sluffed up on my order by not including the nice embossed dustjacket that goes on the case, which is shown in the catalog, so don't be surprised if you're missing yours if u get one from amazon.  it'll kinda suk if i'm the only one that get's screwed on that end of the deal.  the movie is excellent.  it's about family and all that mushy crap we all love.  dialogue is good, plot is good, charcters are interesting, pacing and action are great.  I've read the reviews on the transfer, and everyone thinks it's great, but i found it to be a \\"soft\\" picture.  the colors didn't \\"pop\\" as much as they could (except in the \\"cyber-scenes\\"), and the black line art seemed a bit blurred and not as distinctive as other blu ray anime.  Granted, some line art in anime is thinner or thicker, depending on the movie, but it should still be very distinct and bold, not weak and slightly blurred.  It almost felt like an \\"upscale\\" transfer, like FLCL, just slightly better.  My TV is a new Sony and properly calibrated, new blu ray player with best cables btw.  I hope they \\"re-encode\\" this movie in the future, because it's durn good.  Not the worst transfer by any means, but coulda been way better.
B004N62KTG|5.0|Just grabbed a copy at Wal-Mart... who I would like to thank for making this available to all of us little monsters.. A few of our local music stores don't even have this today as a new release.. how ridiculous. The remixes are very good though wish there were more, most likely will be another remix ep part II. So this is a nice teaser for BTW album which GaGa fans are finding a challenge to wait for... May still seems so far away... cannot recall the last time I so eagerly anticipated a new album/cd... crazy... the samples of 'Government Hooker' on Thierry Mugler fashion show were HOT!! Forgot where I saw online where someone had an opportunity to listen to snippets of the BTW album... they said after playing their 'speakers were thirsty'... they had raves for what they heard.. get ready everyone for what WILL be an incredible journey...bass in your face... dance floor thumpers & rockin' beats that we will play over and over again. As far as copycat rumors can we ALL just get over that already... there will always be comparisions.. GaGa didn't take a yr and half to make an album of retread material... she def will pay homage to 80's & 90's pop and more. The woman is out there but in a great way... interesting, whacky, wonderful..... GAGA!!!!
B003UESJHY|5.0|As a Screen Actors Guild member I have the honor annually to vote on the performances that are nominated for the Awards. I make sure that I see every performance even when the film doesn't particularly interest me. I felt that way going into the theater to see The Fighter. I had the pleasure of performing in Rocky Balboa, and going into this film I thought, \\"how many times are people going to try and remake the Rocky story?\\" I grew up in Philadelphia so watching the trailer for this film was uncomfortable, I grew up having the family fights over girlfriends and the neighborhood knowing every thing about you and your life, it's small town just like the feel you get when watching the ads for this film. I have the crazy drug addict who was a brother to me lost in my past too. I just felt this was going to be a two dementional ride to a predictable ending. I was wrong. The performances were riviting, the story though familliar had merit and dimension, and Christian Bale steals every scene that he is in. I beleive Christian said it best himself at the Golden Globes when he said \\" you can only give a Loud performance when you have a quiet anchor, thank you Mark Wahlberge, I've played the stoic part and it never gets noticed\\" Wahlberge anchors the film and the insanity that unravels around him is beleivable, palpable and exceptional. I walked away wanting to see more, which truly surprised me, Well done.

B002ZG99N6|4.0|Ben Affleck's second directorial effort is based on the novel Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan, with a screenplay by Peter Craig, Affleck, and Aaron Stockard, who co-wrote the screenplay for Affleck's first film [[ASIN:B0010ZR160 Gone Baby Gone]]. Taking place in Boston, an area which Affleck is quite familiar with, The Town is a heist movie that has been inevitably compared to Heat with few mentioning how it compares to recent ventures into the \\"heist\\" sub-genre. In comparison to most of the mindless, non-stop action heist movies that have been released in the last few years, The Town is a welcome return to the heist films that had both story and characters that were more than mere pawns of the screenplay. As a whole, The Town is a terrific, though imperfect film expertly handled by its unlikely director who has proven himself a worthy director with his two films.    \\"One blue-collar Boston neighborhood has produced more bank robbers and armored car thieves than anywhere in the world. Charlestown.\\" While I can't testify to the accuracy of this, the film's opening title card sets the stage for what's in store and the opening scene puts us right into the middle of a bank robbery, where the robbers expertly infiltrate the bank and make off with the money and a hostage named Claire (Rebecca Hall). The robbers are lead by the level-headed Doug MacRay (Affleck), although commissioned and basically controlled by the florist, Fergie Colm (the late Pete Postlethwaite). The group is paranoid about the wild-card in their group James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), who was responsible for the kidnapping during the robbery and now may need to tie up loose ends when he finds that their hostage lives only a few blocks from them. With their latest job attracting the attention of the F.B.I. and the driven F.B.I. agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm), Doug offers to make sure the girl is not a threat. This sets up an unlikely relationship between the former hostage and her kidnapper.    Whether you've been to Boston or not, it's clear that Affleck knows the rhythm and the language of the area very well and his Boston-setting is almost a character itself. While Affleck's acting career soured in the early 2000s due to a string of high-profile flops, it's clear this Boston setting he's in his element both as an actor and director. The Town is a dramatic heist film, certainly not the first of its kind, yet Affleck handles the material with both confidence and skill. With bits of drama, action, romance, and even some humor, Affleck handles these elements capably by establishing strong, distinct characters whose decisions seem natural and not just fueled by what the script requires of them. The heist sequences are tense, exciting, and intelligently executed without sacrificing the story and characters for mindless action. Even the exaggerated masks that are used lend to the tone established and make the scenes more memorable, despite not bringing anything new to the sub-genre. Making its setting such an integral part of the story would not succeed without a strong cast and Affleck has assembled a cast that elevates already strong material.    Affleck and Renner, the latter of whom received a Best Supporting Oscar nomination for his role, brilliantly contrast each other with Renner playing a despicable psychopath allowing a more extroverted, attention-garnering role and Affleck playing the good-hearted, introverted role that tends to garner less acclaim. It's obvious that Affleck's ability as an actor has matured quite gracefully over the last few years and he proves to be an impressive force here. With what seems to be a renewed passion for his craft and the freedom to play by his own rules, he brings both depth and a disarming charm to his role as Doug. Displaying both confidence and vulnerability, he's presents himself as an actor ready to be taken seriously again. Meanwhile, Jeremy Renner manages to upstage nearly everyone with his great performance. A far cryfrom his role in The Hurt Locker that thrust him into recognition, Renner marvelously alternates between intensely charming and venomous, depending on what the moment calls for. His character is dangerous and unpredictable which Renner makes wholly believable while adding an acute sense of humanity as well. Few performances of this sort are as convincing as Renner's here; you wouldn't want to mess with him and you can see him ready to snap at any moment, yet you feel empathy for him as well. Hamm, Hall, Postlethwaite, Slaine, Blake Lively, and Chris Cooper all do some great work as well, making this a true ensemble effort. As an actor, Affleck knows how to work with actors and he gets impressive the best from all involved.    Quite simply, The Town is fast-paced, very entertaining, and (best of all) well-made. It's not a masterpiece, although I'd be troubled to go on about its imperfections at any great length and Affleck is proving himself to be an impressive filmmaker who has crafted a heist film that stands alongside the few great/really good films of this genre. He tackles his film with passion, energy, and vision proving once-and-for-all that he's worth taking seriously and reassessing. The Town may not be his masterpiece, but it's got me excited for what he'll bring to the film world in the future.    GRADE: B
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|If you are familiar with some of the newer Miyazaki films (Sprited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo), you might be in for quite a shock with this film.  Princess Mononoke is a little out there, this is waaaaaaaaay out there (in a good way).<br /><br />When Miyazaki tells a story, one can't help but be drawn into the realm of his imagination.  This film is based on a series of manage (Japanese adult/young adult comics).  The theme boils down to this question: can humans truly coexist and find an equilibrium with their environment.  Set in the distant future of earth, this story gives a warning as to the futility of war (violence begets violence; killing begets more killing) and shows that despite the seeming difficulty, peace can often be more powerful than violence.<br /><br />Though the animation is dated, I enjoyed taking a trip down memory lane, having grown up in the 80s and familiar with Dragon Ball, Thundercats, G Force, and other fun little 80s anime titles.  For the time, this was cutting edge, and despite the lack of computer editing, the quality of animation is superb.  I do enjoy traditional hand drawn animation and this doesn't let me down.<br /><br />With the new Blu-Ray DVD combo, I hope that this film can be re-introduced to audiences and gain new fans young and old.  The message in this film is one of hope, and we can all use a little lift in our spirits every now and then.<br /><br />Note: I prefer viewing in the original Japanese; though Patrick Stewart is a strong reason to watch the English dub!
B0042JIL1U|5.0|\\"Authentic\\" period performance now means anything a conductor wants it to mean, and this \\"life is a box of chocolates\\" attitude can be refreshing. No two sets of Brandenburg Concertos sound alike, which was true in the  pre-HIP past, too, since the score lacks dynamics and expression markings. Some may choose to take this as a sign that Bach wanted the musicians to play without expression -- a strange interpretation but one that is quite prevalent in many flat-as-a-pancake period performances. But just as many performances use strange and wild types of expression; the only thing that is never allowed is romanticism. Until Abbado, that is, who adopts a style that is affectionate, very quiet, and as reflective as Chopin -- it could easily be played in a small room for an audience of one.<br /><br />The aging, esteemed conductor has been championing HIP style for some years, most recently with an Italian period group called Orchestra Mozart. Up to now Abbado's Bach has not been represented in his commercial recordings, although there have been concert performances, some of which, according to his discography, have found limited release, usually by private means. I had assumed he was scared off by the rigors of period dogma. The days when a Karajan, Bernstein, or Klemperer routinely recorded the B minor Mass or the Passions have flown away. As with brain surgery, you must invite in a specialist to operate on Bach. Abbado doesn't break the ground rules. We get the usual hallmarks of period style: quick-step pacing, no vibrato, recorders instead of flutes, clipped phrasing instead of legato, etc. But his gentle ways are quite striking; almost every movement is unassertive and soft. The dynamics rarely rise above mezzo forte, and where you expect joyous outbursts, as in the clarino trumpet solos of Concerto #2, the balance remains subdued, with the trumpet no louder than the recorders.<br /><br />One advantage of tis approach is that the harpsichord, a very soft instrument, doesn't have to be artificially miked. It's recessive in tuttis but still audible in a natural way. In solos the harpsichord is soft as a feather, although played at lightning speed in Cto. #5. Prominent players have been brought in for prominent parts such as harpsichord, recorder, and violin. DG's sonics are natural and not too close. You are given a perspective in the middle of a chamber-sized hall. The real question has to do with what the music means. I still prefer the Brandenburgs under Benjamin Britten because he applies the tactics of a great conductor while recognizing the niceties of period style (in part). Abbado is more discreet, but without stepping forward with bold gestures, he manages to create a refined, civilized mood that in the end makes these readings highly enjoyable and different from the usual jog-trot HIP performances., doesn't have to be artificially miked.

B0049OSQ18|2.0|I really had high hopes for this album. I liked Crane Wife and I loved Hazards of Love. I really thought they were on to something, but The Decemberists definitely dropped the ball on this one. There are a couple good tracks on the album (Rise to Me & Down by the Water), but I have to ask, what is with all the harmonica? Seriously, do people enjoy listening to the obnoxious shrill of that horrifying instrument? I guess it's back to Hazards of Love until the Decemberists decide to pull their heads out of their asses.  Yours hopeful but totally disappointed,  Calvin
B00007KWHO|3.0|Yes' second album was a transitional work that found the band working with an orchestra on several tracks.  The band was really beginning to spread their wings on this one with many allusions to musical styles that the band would explore much further in the future.  Chris Squire's bass and Tony Kaye's organ really stand out on this one.  The album would also be the last one for original guitarist Peter Banks who turns in some very nice work here.  The album opens with a very different cover of Richie Haven's \\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\\" complete with full orchestral arrangement fusing the theme music from the movie \\"The Big Country\\" in with the track.  A bold move for sure and a good example of the innovation that would eventually set Yes apart from the emerging progressive rock pack in the early 70's.  The rest of the album feature several Yes classics that still make their way into live performances from time to time especially the title track \\"Time And A Word\\".  Yes would go on to do much better albums than this one, but \\"Time\\" is a fine early effort from a young innovative band just getting their creative feet wet.

B00005OAE6|3.0|Seger had hit the big time with his previous two albums, \\"Live Bullet\\" and \\"Night Moves\\".  He was now a huge rock n roll star who could fill arenas from coast to coast.  The pressure was on for more hits and with \\"Stranger In Town\\" Seger delivered the goods.  Many tracks from this album were (and still are) all over AOR / Classic Rock radio.  \\"Hollywood Nights\\", \\"Still The Same\\", \\"Old Time Rock N Roll\\", \\"Feel Like A Number\\", and \\"We've Got Tonight\\" have been played to death over the years which may be why I am a bit lukewarm on this album.  I don't think that it is up to the same level as \\"Night Moves\\" and is probably on a par with the next one \\"Against The Wind\\".  \\"Brave Strangers\\" and \\"The Famous Final Scene\\" are highlights and the song \\"Feel Like A Number\\" always reminds me to treat my employees (I work as a production supervisor) as real people and not like the character in the song.  Overall this is a solid Seger disc but not quite as good as \\"Night Moves\\" in my opinion.

B000002KCC|4.0|I p[icked this album up when it first came out...having read the Rolling Stone interview that preceded it. Neil said of this album, something to the effect of: \\"If you're partying, this isn't the album you want to have playing. Put on The Doobie Brothers instead.\\" He wasn't kidding. This is not a feelgood album. It was something he presumably had to put out to release some inner demons. Most of it comes off just fine, as ragged as it is. The one exception that I still cannot listen to even after this many years, is \\"Mellow My Mind\\":, containing one of his hardest vocals to sit through. He strains to hit the high C in the bridge and after the one time I heard it, it's just to hard for me to sit through again. It reminds me of Joe Cocker's last note in \\"You Are So Beautiful\\". I wish both of these songs could be recut with better vocals in those spots. Few things rip through me like that, and it's a shame that one thing can ruin a great album that way. I'd love to hear an alternate take on \\"Mellow My Mind\\" from perhaps a session that came out differently. I'm very attuned to pitch and tone and some may criticize me for saying this, but certainly Neil Young could have done better than THAT.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|Wow ,what a great movie ,with white snow as background ,red riding hood's cape in  blood red ,Amanda's blonde hair ,and blue eyes ,makes for one startling scene .even the trees are amazing with large thornlike spikes coming out of them .Gary oldman did a wonderful job as the priest who comes to battle with the big bad wolf.This is one delicious movie to watch at the theater.Very good pacing ,keeps you in suspense the whole way through as to who is the wolf .I would say to you just go watch this movie ,it's way above average .
B0042RUMJG|5.0|Plane and simple.... remarkable.  The sound, the new life, the classics revived.  I can go on and on.  How many artists of his caliber can keep the high level of artistry like Sting ? Not many.  He truly is an icon in which every genre of music respects and looks up to.  We all know how great of a song writer he is.  But no one can really match up to how versatile Stings music and lyrics have withstood the test of time.  This DVD really showcases the beauty and how moving his music really is. You go to his concerts and you see all age groups and all people from around the world are represented.  I attend many concerts for many other artists, and his crowds by far are the most versatile.  He appeals to everyone.  This DVD will renew your love for his art.   I cannot say enough about the man.  I had the honor of meeting him, and the best thing about that moment was how humble he presented himself at that moment.  That sealed it for me.  For all his fame he finds himself with, it has not spoiled the man.  The man who all artists look up to.  Everyone should be so humble.  Enjoy !
0312600844|1.0|I belong to a book club. This book is on the best sellers list, and recommended by Oprah. It was our book for March. After meeting only 1 person finished the book. Every one disliked it so much that we gathered all the books after the meeting and discarded them. This is the first time we have done any thing like this. It was unanimous that  the book was not only awful, but none of us would even share it with any one.
B004LOJPLQ|4.0|This film was fantastic. I really enjoyed the true-life adaptation of some pretty larger-than-life characters. This is one case where truth is more bizarre than fiction, especially when it comes to Dicky. Christian Bale does a great job as the hilarious crackhead half-brother of boxer Micky Ward. Marky Mark does what Marky Mark does... he plays the understated emotional guy with abs of steel. Amy Adams does white trash quite well, but not nearly to the level of Melissa Leo. Wow! She leads an army of cigarette skinned trashettes though a world of emotional self-centered drama like no other! Between her and Bale's performances - I was almost inspired to grow a mullet and buy a Trans Am with T-Tops.     The story is what you would expect: Rocky 10, but with far superior acting. Yet, I don't care - I really enjoyed it! Great action, heart-felt drama, wacky fun moments, and that never give up spirit that is always hard to deny. This film didn't come with any preloaded Oscar pretense. They kept it real. Amy Adams even kept on her baby fat and showed it off with halter tops. That's Chevy proud!    As far as the 2010 market of true story inspiration films go, The Fighter delivers the emotional punch that the King's Speech didn't for me. Maybe it's because I'm biased. I'm an Amuricun!
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I love Jodi Picoult's writing. I fell in love with her when I read \\"Second Glance\\" as a very broke student. Her latest novel once again blew me away. The issues dealt with in the book are very close to my heart and I overslept more than once because I could not put it down. Her utter lack of judgement towards the viewpoint of the different characters (except the vile and miserable Wade) impressed me to no end.  She is an amazing author and I cannot wait for her next books. I wish that I could hear the music composed for the book, but it is not available locally yet. \\"Sing you home\\" is a beautifully written novel with a host of great characters. Dara is my favorite probably she reminds me of my own very interesting and slightly eccentric mother. Jodi Picoult never disappoints and deserves the highest praise for a gorgeous and thought provoking piece of writing.
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|I thought this would be a typical romantic comedy, and in a few ways it was. Man/woman falls in love, has self doubt, overcomes self doubt to become happy.     The rest of the story was much deeper than I expected. It dealt with mortality issues, acceptance, true love, material living vs happiness, our corrupt health care system, self-esteem and greed. I felt at times it pulled in a few too many directions, but not enough to make me lose interest. The acting was good. Some of the supporting roles seemed a bit shallow, but the focus was on the main characters for the most part - and they did a pretty good job. Development of the characters was decent. There were enough cute and funny parts to lighten up the pretty serious drama of Parkinson's disease. It also shows a good amount of nudity of both actors, so beware if that isn't or is your cup of tea. Overall I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could. I would rank most romantic comedies in the 1 or 2 star area, so I was rather pleased, but not blown away.
B003YV64OI|5.0|Excellent CPU, unlocked its 4th core and its running smoothly, just perfect.

B004R36QUE|3.0|Maybe all of the hype had me expecting more. I didn't see this as an Oscar winning best picture at all. I thought it was a good story that was well-acted. Every actor was fantastic I'll admit. The plot was solid yet typical. It's based on a true story, so the artistic license didn't have the liberty that some plots enjoy.    I felt at times like the story was rushed. I wanted more out of the relationship with the king and the therapist, but at times it felt like we got the Cliff Notes version of their relationship. Plus, I was expecting an overpowering sense of happiness and achievement in the end. A feel good money shot so-to-say. And maybe for some that is what they felt. For me it felt like the emotional fever pitch was taken up to around 70% instead of 100%. Perhaps that is the downplayed British nature versus the over-the-top American style of drama that I have become accustomed to seeing. I don't know. I guess a lot of people thought Titanic was great too. 3 or 3 1/2 stars at best. I liked \\"The Social Network\\", \\"The Fighter\\" and \\"Inception\\" better for this year's Oscar picks.
0312370830|4.0|This was a cannot put it down read for me. I got it as I was traveling in Paris and wanted a novel set in the city. The chapter narrations switches between Sarah, a child in 1942, and Julie, a journalist in 2002 looking into the French round-up of Jews. Yes, I found Julie rather spineless in terms of her allowing herself to be verbally abused by her French husband and his family about being \\"L'americaine,\\" but ultimately, she was a satisfying character. I've rather turned away from Holocaust novels due to their intensity, and this one was a relief due to the back-and-forth nature of the narration/plot. I'd recommend it as a good novel that delivers a punch but ends satisfyingly.
1439102724|2.0|This book is very dissapointing for Jodi Piccoult. I usually reserve books at the library to save money, but couldn't wait so I purchased this as soon as it was released. I was so excited for a new Piccoult read. What a waste of time. I read the book so quickly because I kept waiting for the tone to change from judgemental to conflict which is the normal for her books. This never happened. I am fairly open minded and this book wa stotally one sided. The gay saintly lesbians vs the evil christians. What a dissapointing take and very boring read. The ending was absolutely predictable for the tone of the book..no surprise here. Don't waste your time or money, just read a quick synapsis and you will figure out the ending. VERY DISSAPOINTING READ!
B004G5ZXVQ|3.0|Only this much is objective: Either you like the ironic, Beatles-y, highly produced, world-weary tone that steadily colonized R.E.M.'s recordings after Document, or you don't.    Me, not so much. So I was pleased by 2008's Accelerate, and delighted by 2009's Live at the Olympia, for resurrecting the energy, conviction, and pure singability of the band's early, Byrds-influenced garageterpieces.    Here on Collapse, the Viagra is starting to wear off. Sure, the energy is still here, as is producer Jacknife Lee. But irony and uninspired overproduction are starting to ooze back in.    The disc has a few irresistible tunes. (To my ear: \\"That Someone Is You,\\" \\"ÜBerlin,\\" \\"Me, Marlon Brando...,\\" and \\"Blue.\\") A few other songs start out infectious, but then deliberately distance you with calculatedly angular arpeggios or chord progressions.    Then there's filler in which wily Michael Stipe seems to be proudly proclaiming utter lack of inspiration -- usually with plenty of studio tricks larded on.    Several songs play like paint-by-numbers reworkings of earlier R.E.M. tunes. \\"ÜBerlin\\" owes a big debt to \\"Losing My Religion,\\" but in a good way -- it's a beautiful song, nicely produced in a completely different vein.    \\"Oh My Heart\\" recalls \\"Houston,\\" but in a smirking, calculated way. \\"Every Day Is Yours To Win\\"...well, if anyone wanted a reprise of \\"Nightswimming,\\" here you go.    I streamed the whole CD a few times during NPR's preview window. Then finally bought it, for the few songs I like (see above). A couple are fine anthems that will stand with this great band's best work. I just wish the rebooted R.E.M. could sustain such inspiration and conviction more consistently. Early fans beware, they're losing their religion again.

Justin Timberlake doesn't have much to do, and I'd never heard of the kid who plays Mark Zuckerberg, but his acting was no great shakes. Of course, by all accounts, Zuckerberg is kind of a computer zombie, so there wasn't much to work with. If you want the same tale in a somewhat more enjoyable print version, check out \\"The Accidental Billionaire.\\" It seems to be the movie, down to a T.
B004O88LPA|4.0|I have tried reading some of the Discworld books before about ten years ago, and never really sunk my teeth into them because I just couldn't follow Pratchett's oddball humor.  After watching this mini-series, I think I will have to go back and try re-reading them now.  The dialog of the script is very tongue in cheek and quite witty, very British style humor.  I found myself appreciating the play on words and dry humor that reminded me of watching the [[ASIN:B002LFPAUM Black Adder]] series.<br />The cast of characters throws modern cliches at fantasy/sci-fi archetypes, and the end result is humor that sits at about a 90 degree turn from the rest of the genre. Anyone who has ever been a \\"Tourist\\" in a foreign country will laugh at some of the things they recognize in Sean Astin's character.<br />The special effects are quite well done for a made for TV special.  I would never have found this video without browsing through the free streaming videos for Amazon Prime members, and I found myself wishing there was more to this series.  Now I'm keen to try a bit more patience with the rest of the books.

B000001FTD|5.0|Anthrax released arguably their masterpiece in the spring of '87 with `Among the Living', a definitive thrash metal statement and still a favorite for many fans today.  After solidifying their now classic lineup with `Spreading the Disease', the band followed up that mission statement with the complete package. The heavy speed riffing, the double bass drumming and a melodic and rangy vocalist to sing over the top were the key ingredients to Anthrax's metal machine. Any best of survey of the band's catalog would include such triumphs as \\"Caught in a Mosh\\", \\"I Am the Law\\" and \\"Indians\\" in any listing and they show up loud and proud as does the title track.  Tributes to Stephen King, Judge Dredd and John Belushi (though this would hardly be called a tribute as the uselessness of a life wasted by drug abuse) are all part of the savage chronicle that Anthrax presents as their interests in pop culture. \\"Indians\\" and \\"One World\\" show a cultural consciousness that maybe many outside the metal community would think couldn't be possible from a scruffy metal band. Anthrax always wanted to present themselves as different, even in the thrash world and it's this unique approach to metal which has made them one of the genre's greats. `Among the Living' would be the highpoint of the Joey Belladonna era as a staleness started to infiltrate the Anthrax sound and changes would come in the next decade but in the Eighties everything still worked. Don't mess with success.
B000M53GQS|5.0|There are lots of reasons for buying this item. Firstly, 2 of Gerry's best albums. Secondly, the price, and finally you can't go wrong with anything by Gerry Rafferty.<br />If you have never listened to him before this is a superb album to purchase. It shows the songsmith at his best. Gerry was one of the best singer song writers of his generation and it is impossible to understate the mans talent. Buy and enjoy.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|First of all, I went to my local video store, and got one of those 'rental exclusives' copy of HEREAFTER. The first thing I noticed, was how out of focus most of the scenes were. More like 'soft focus' out of control. At first, I thought there was something wrong with the production of this DVD. Many straight vertical lines and objects appear curved, like they were shot with a wide angle lens. But, thats supposed to give you more depth of focus, not blurriness. This hampered my enjoyment of the film very much.<br />The story line hardly grabbed me at all. Its like Eastwood wanted to make a European film. Vague, understated, and bleak. Matt Damon gives his best performance. Because, Eastwood made him drop all of his routine expressions. You know, that half smile-half smirk look. He completely transformed Damon's performance, into quite a magnificent understatement.<br />But, the story just never really grabbed me enough to hold my interest. I nodded off to sleep on more than one occasion.<br />So, this film is still a mystery to me. I hated the way it was filmed, unless those rental exclusive copies were defective. The story did'nt interest me, but Damon's performance is so outstanding, because it is so...un-Damon like. I dunno Clint...I just dont know.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Great
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|... as opposed to a really long cinematic. The time added to this version of Advent Children in my opinion does wonders for it. Little more action thrown in which is always nice, but most importantly there's some much needed character and story development.     And Red XIII STILL didn't get any more lines, darn it all.     If you love FF7 and liked Advent Children at all, or if you DIDN'T like AV because of what it lacked, AV: Complete throws in what the original didn't have and it's all the better for it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I've really enjoyed The Name of the Wind and now The Wise Man's Fear. WMF picks up right where we leave off in the first novel. Some have mentioned that the book could have been shorter, but any book could be shorter. Do you want a fully developed story of a man's life or just your run of the mill Fantasy? This series requires patience, but it is rewarded. This reads like the autobiography of Kvothe, which essentially is what it is. We're getting all of the things: good, bad even mundane that have happened in order to shape this man's life.    This is far from your average questing fantasy novel and well worth the time you put into it. Rothfuss is a master world builder and he wants you to really engage this world. Read outside of the box on this one. There's some action--not as much as others, but no less than Name of the Wind either. In fact we get a bit deeper into Kvothe's time in the Fae...he is changed dramatically by it.     For younger readers I would caution against heavy use of foul language as well as many quite sensual parts, especially involving Felurian. Still, Wise Man's Fear is a superbly well-written continuation in the story that leaves us tired by the end of the over 1,000 pages, but still eager to know how the story will conclude. Recommended for Adult Fans of Fantasy who enjoy a departure from the cliche.

B003R0LBVW|3.0|I have to say, this is no Corrections, the 2002 Jonathan Franzen novel that first got me hooked on this author. Freedom certainly makes for a good read, but it is taxing in several places, partly because of the unusual structure of the novel (very long chapters, switching focus and narration among several characters). Most of the book portrays a pretty bleak picture of human relations, though the author manages to somehow make the reader actually care for the deeply dysfunctional characters that the novel follows over several years, even when said characters are clearly at odds with each other. The conclusion is surprisingly optimistic and redeems pretty much everyone - which frankly was a bit of a let down, since it simply didn't seem to be in synch with the tone of the bulk of the novel, nor with the personalities of the characters as portrayed up to that point. Still, a good read if you are not depressed.
1844137864|5.0|Banksy is one of the most relevant modern artist of our time and this book shows an excellent sampling of his works along with commentary from Banksy himself on how he accomplished some of his most daring feats.  Notably excluded is his work at Disneyland.
B00004W4UB|5.0|One of my top 5 all time favorite movies.... I haven't been able to get away from it... An excellent way of portraying the Jekyll and Hyde persona... They could not have found better candidates for the characters if they tried, John Malkovich and Julia Roberts are perfect for these rolls I couldn't see anyone else in their respective parts... The suspense was wonderful yet slightly frustrating through the entire movie I just kept wanting to see more of the romantic aspect between Jekyll and Reilly, although it would have ruined the romantic tension and thus a very large part of the movie...    The only real problem I have had with this movie is the fact that there are parts in the preview (which I saw many years ago, as well as many times since) which are not in the actual movie in which I would have loved to see in the dvd release of this movie... I doubt I am the only one who feels this way... Someone should really think about making another release of this film including the deleted scenes I have no doubt it would make some money!!!
B004BLJQOK|3.0|I wasn't too sure what to expect from this movie. I've watched other 'vampire' movies but this was different. Not better, not worse, just different from the usual commercial vampire storyline.<br /><br />I didn't see the original and I didn't read the original book so my expectations were open. The movie is pretty dark and gloomy most of the time (which makes sense because of the main character's 'condition'. I was enjoying it to some extent until the first attack scene where the special effects went very 70's. Unrealistic, odd, stilted movement quickly dissolved any suspension of reality while watching.<br /><br />It has such a dark and depressing theme throughout, the scenery, characters, and events were all big downers while watching.<br /><br />What I did like is the fact that it was not the usual box office American movie. It was unique enough to keep me watching but too depressing to watch again.
B0045MPPJK|3.0|The album is good, and I got this version instead of the cheaper version at http://www.amazon.com/O-Explicit/dp/B0045IZW9W/ thinking that the digital booklet might be cool.  As near as I can tell, it is the CD insert.  It's 6 pages long, with a couple of photos, plus the production credits.  No lyrics, no \\"behind the scenes\\".  Not worth it in my opinion, get the version minus the digital booklet instead.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|As a work of art in its genre, it is unsurpassed: riveting, slick, concise, explosive in its revelation. Hell even the music is good. What's ultimately so upsetting is that it shows that American culture and its government is so infected by and inseparable from the interests portrayed in this film that nothing short of dramatic upheaval of our political system will change anything. I don't see that happening; not when the seemingly most progressive President we've had in half a century appoints these malefactors to his staff, and the voting process is about as effective as fighting cancer by democratically electing your favorite brand of cigarette.    Like his previous work, and unlike many socio-political docs, the filmmaker doesn't just present an emotional case for something you already believed; he shows you (at least many of us) entirely new things to be angry about, and has you marveling at the fact that you weren't aware of them already.    Not that it does any good.
1569242739|5.0|i got this as a bday gift for a vegan friend and she absolutely loves it! the recipes are delicious and use basic ingredients you can find in a grocery store, nothing too exotic that you have to hunt around for. surprisingly the cupcakes taste remarkably un-vegan, which is a great compliment! i definitely recommend!!!
B002ZG98FU|2.0|I agree with another reviewer that this movie started out boring and was almost too silly.  I was looking for something on the scale of 27 Dresses. The story line was drawn out a bit.
030746363X|4.0|I did extensive reading to see if this was just some guy BSing his way through the book, but turns out it wasn't. Of course,there's an enormous amount of text considering the meal plan is pretty straight forward and could be resumed in a paragraph or two.   I also haven't paid attention to the rest of the book, except for the Improve Sleeping section.  I didn't weight myself as I just don't care about weight but I do care about measures and about fitting into the rest of my clothes and dumping my fat suit and it went as follows.  I started on a 48.3 inch circumference of fat around my belly. Eating a protein, side of spinach and beans. As soon as I started I noticed how I didn't feel swollen anymore so I finished my first week to the letter. On my no diet day I ate and drank till I felt sick. On week two I started getting creative with my food and came up with some really interesting stuff (i.e. sandwiches with garlic rosted eggplant instead of bread, and so forth). I also couldn't keep away from wine, leaving beer aside for the duration of experiment. On my first 13 days, before I went on a binge I had lost 2 whole inches off my beerpot, no exercise whatsoever.  By week four I had to sew the waist of my pants as they kept falling. From then on I have derailed from the food plan and I'm not strict about it as I used to be.  I will eat carbohydrates on some days but try to not go overboard with them, you know, just to get a taste.  By week five I didn't miss my carbs and still don't. I lost a total of 5 inches (I started on January 25th, 2011).  Last week I ate lost of pizza, pasta and other things I love (not a big fan of sweet, I guess that helps) since I was away from  home. I back fearing I would have to undue the fixtures on my pants but turns out I fit into them nicely and even managed to lose more belly fat, since they are now loosening again. I also ingested magnesium and potassium per stated on the book but not religiously and drank lots of water. I also hadsome meals with that lovely cola drink we all know and wine.   According to Wii Fit I used to weight 224lbs, now I on 197lbs! I didn't suffer one bit. When I got hungry I just ate more. When I got fed up of the strict plan I would cook what I call Nacho-less Nachoes which is basically the topping, and sans-the-bread Pizza Salad and so forth. I did add some cheese from time to time for flavoring.  I also found that some combination foods would just kill any hunger I would have for over 20 hours (frankfurters some BBQ sauce, huge olives and almonds, I'm eclectic, I know) to pay even further results.  Easy to do, cheaper than a digital download per meal, convenient and foolproof simple, I recommend this to anyone, pretty much. You might have some heartburn from time to time (until you tweak your food in to the right meal for you) but nothing a little pepto wouldn't take care of.  I did no exercise what so ever during this time and I ate more without overstuffing myself.   So, read the book, learn the basics, keep them in mind.  If you happen to sin along the way just hop on back and you'll be fine.  This truly was the first step to a 25% Off Me.
031606792X|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BOOK.  DID NOT WANT IT TO END.  WE REALLY NEED STEPHANIE  TO TELL US EDWARDS SIDE,  U WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN.  I HAVEN'T READ IN YEARS,  NOW I CAN'T STOP READING
0316098337|5.0|<some spoilers>    Room, narrated by five-year old Jack, is a heart-wrenching story of solitary confinement and adaptation, wherever that may be. To Jack, Room is all he's ever known, but to his young, abducted and sexually abused mother, it's hell inside an eleven by eleven foot box. For Jack it's only ever been him and Ma and Outside is just an imaginary world inside TV. Ma's continuously depressed and desperate for a way to escape while she tries to keep her son happy, healthy, and entertained with games and activities. While her sanity's on thin ice, Ma develops a cunning trick, which narrowly works, to spring the two of them free.     Once Ma and Jack enter Outside, or the real world that we're accustomed to, it becomes a struggle for Jack and his mother to adapt to a new environment. With the hungry media breathing down their necks, the newly freed prisoners keep to the medical clinic for privacy and assimilation back into society. To Jack, the Outside is very confusing and \\"scavey\\" and as the novel progresses, we learn how he interprets his new world. While Jack is learning about Ma's family and the many new rules of the world, Ma's battling her own demons and coming to grips with how seven years of torture affected her. This story brings a whole new meaning to captivity, exposure, and reality, and how our environments can change in a matter of minutes.    Donoghue creates an interesting thriller by having Room narrated by an extraordinary   five year old child. His language and interpretation of an eleven by eleven foot room and his adaptation to his new world is amazing. Her characters were deeply developed, moving, and charismatic. It is a story unlike any other and takes the meaning of kidnapping and survival to a whole new level. I was able to really feel for this child and understand isolation and desperation. What was even more chilling was how Donoghue set this book during modern times, as if this story could unfold in tomorrow morning's newspaper.Room was an excellent read and as an English teacher, I would definitely use this book in a variety of ways. If I couldn't add this book to the curriculum I would definitely have it on an independent reading list, which I plan on having my kids do throughout the year. After reading Room, I would have students do a creative project (3-D modeling, paintings, newspaper writing, reports, advertisements, etc). Depending upon my class I would discuss with them their choices and what I would expect them to report on. I would also use this book when I do literature circles and have it as an option for a group to choose. If for some reason I wasn't able to use the entire book, I would use it along with the science-fiction short story, Born of Man and Woman, by Richard Matheson. It is a story about a young child who narrates his life while he is kept in a basement. It is extremely different from Room but I believe the beginning of Donoghue's book and Matheson's short story would make a great pair. Also because Jack's language of Room tends to be broken, incorrect, or highly intelligent at times, this book would be great to look at some literary terms and techniques.    Room is unlike any other book I've read, but I'm glad to have experienced Jack's world, no matter how haunting and claustrophobic it was.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|After viewing the 10th anniversary concert, at least monthly since its release, I was overjoyed to find this concert!  After seeing it on PBS, I immediately went to Amazon and ordered my own copy.  In the role of Jean Valjean, Alfie Boe was up to par with Colm Wilkinson, as was Norm Lewis in the role of Javert.  I agree with the previous reviewer about Lea Solonga as Fantine; not quite as full as Ruthie Henshall. Cosette and Eponine were equally represented in their characters.  Nick Jonas was merely OK in singing, and stiff in the acting.  As was stated in other reviews, he was outclassed by the magnificence of the rest of the cast.  Political casting to attract the teeny boppers.  If the grand finale didn't leave your heart pounding, you missed something along the way.  I will continue to watch both productions, with preference to the 10th, but will watch the 25th on occasion as well.    The day after viewing on TV, it was announced that the 25th Anniversary concert will be touring, and in our city next April.  I BOUGHT TICKETS THIS AFTERNOON!!   My favorite show of all time!!
B000A61RO2|5.0|It's a great CD.  The sounds are distinctive, unusual, and very pleasing to the ears.  Buy it and enjoy it!  I do!
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Seriously - people still pay $100 plus at retail for HDMI cables. Snap a few of these up and keep them around. Great quality, and an unbelievable price.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|So far this has been the best of the Twilight series.  This draws you in and makes you yearn for the next movie in the series to come out.
B000002KE2|1.0|Someone decided that the aimless riffs and undeveloped ideas would make a nice Sabbath's Coda.  Leftovers! Unheated. Popular with Eagles, Justin Beiber and lots of Ozzy fans.  The only song that shines through is \\"Snowblind\\".  I don't understand the interest in this album, its as bad as Technical Exctasy and Never Say Die.  Wheels of Confusion: 1 chord jam. Tomorrow's Dream: 2 chord jam as is Supernaut and the principal riff for Snowblind. Snowblind is a great song, but the rest are terrible aimless riffing. Cornucopia, an alternating 2 chord / 3 chord aimless jam. St. vitus Dance : Yikes! rubbish. The last song is decent.  It should be noted that after Vol 4., the band blinded by the success with this album, went back to the same studio and Vol 4 part 2 was to began... but it didn't. Shaking the cobwebs of delusion, they returned to England, away from the LA scene, where finally some inspiration began to kick in: Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, and they knew they had taken a wrong turn with Vol 4. and stopped listening to the sychophants tell them how great it was. Instead, they played darts with Rick Wakeman and the band put out two great albums: Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, and Sabotage.  Cheap on the album art. That's Warner Brothers in the 70's.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|I've had this CD in heavy rotation since its release last October and all I can say is I can't get enough of it.  This is a great album of fantastic material start to finish.  Joe never ceases to amaze with his creativity and musicality.  Surrounding himself with top musicians the output is powerful, melodic, and classic satch.  While I enjoy the whole album, I especially love the North African vibe of The Golden Room.  Joe is like the energizer bunny only he just gets better and better.  Highly recommended!
0545265355|2.0|Unlikeable lead character.  Cornball plot disguised as apocalyptic catharsis; and a lack of God or faith that, for a mainstream release, has a decidedly atheist mentality.     First book?  Characters you never get to know dying = no weight.  Don't care.  The first person narrative was the wrong choice for a series about the exploitive death of children.    Second book?  Jumping the shark already.  How?  SPOILER: Back in the game again.  Why didn't she have Peeta and Kat mentor?  Could have followed the same plot line, had two new characters that would surely be more likeable than Katniss, and would have made much more sense.    Third book?  Everything falls apart.  A major surprise death at the end (again, SPOILER her sister, a character we do not know).  Seriously?  Lizard men as defense?  Hunger games methodology protecting the Bad Guy Boss?  What is the inspiration for Mockingjay, Legend of Zelda?  Video games are better these days.      Point?  If you're looking for Harry Potter Volume 2, look elsewhere.  If you want the source material she ripped off, go to BATTLE ROYALE.  The book is a great translation, the manga is stellar.  There's more emotion in the Battle Royale comic than in this entire trilogy.      I love soccer moms, but I do not love soccer mom HYPE.  This is all soccer mom hype.  It is not literature.
031261246X|5.0|A British Airways plane flying over the Atlantic finds its controls suddenly failing.  In Manhattan Fischerman, Platt & Cohen hires computer security expert Jeff Aiken to determine what caused a total system failure. Department of Homeland Security Division of Counter Cyberterrorism operative Daryl Haugen investigates a computer virus that at Brooklyn's Mercy Hospital caused several deaths.  Other deadly incidents also occur due to computer failure.<br /><br />A former government official Aiken and Haugen discuss their cases.  Each is stunned with the similarity.  They soon connect other recent system failures to theirs.  The conclusion each reaches is that a Zero Day globalization attack is coming rather soon.<br /><br />The entertaining story line is linear yet exhilarating and frightening especially since author Mark Russinovich is an expert on the topic as his r&eacute;sum&eacute; brings a scary possibility to the cyber attack that the thriller focuses on.  Aiken and Haugen seems real because they know they cannot stop all the incidents leading to Zero Day and people will die, but want to prevent the pandemic disaster from happening.  Fans will enjoy this powerful cyber-terrorist attack that showcases how vulnerable the West is.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B001H1OUWU|5.0|I've heard it said before that the artist asks questions; so those who are looking for definite answers, in a work of art, probably will never find it.  Miles Davis' Bitches Brew is no exception, there are no clearly defined answers.       This album has a dark mystique to it; ritualist rhythms, dynamic explosions of sound, and textures ranging the spectrum from harsh to mellow.  These musicians are tapping into the black, primeval caverns of the subconscious mind.  Jumping from thought to thought; note to note, just following the next idea to where it takes them.  Vibes are created rather than \\"true\\" music.  If your listening to this album to have a tune you can hum later on, then this is not your type of music.     I have heard many say they \\"don't get this album\\" or \\"do\\".  In my opinion there is nothing really to \\"get\\".  It just is, what it is.  It creates a series of sounds and moods to react to.  Living moment to moment.  No, you do not need to develop your musical palette to listen to this album, you just listen to it.     I like this album a lot and listen to it quite frequently.  The rhythms are extremely infectious.  The dynamic range builds and falls and then bursts out of the silence.  The textural qualities diverse; screechy saxophone to smooth trumpet (or vis versa at times).  The energies trading between electric and vibrant to dark and foggy; fluctuating between chaos and order.  I recommend listening to this album.  You may love it, you may hate it.  But like your mom used to say about new foods, \\"How do you know if you never try it?\\"
1416550550|5.0|If you're a fan of The Thirteenth Tale this is another great book to get hooked on.  Leaves you wondering what happens until the very end.  I thought the fairy tales inside the book were fun to read as well.  You will definitely get lost in this book.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved the Art of Racing in the Rain.  Although I read it in a few days, I couldn't stop talking about it and sharing parts of it with my family.  It made me laugh, made me cry, and was one of the few books that has truly impacted me.  I most definitely recommend this book to anyone with a pet or a soul.  It's fantastic.
0749942908|5.0|Lisa Kleypas's Wallflower series was my first introduction to historical romances.  I really liked the first 2 books in the series, but after Devil in Winter, I was hooked on a new addiction.  I have since bought and read every book Lisa has written.  I fell in love with the characters.  I loved the dialog between the characters.  I laughed and cried and loved every minute of it.  It was a funny and ridiculously romantic love story.    I definitely recommend this book.  However, you really should read the series in order because the story between Evie and St. Vincent starts at the end of book 2 (It Happened One Autumn).    If you are already an historical romance enthusiast, you'll love this book.  If (like me) this isn't your typical genre, this book will convert you.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I was surprised by this novel in a pleasant way. I love a good story regardless of genre and this is a good story. I believe all the characters and can picture them as clear as if I were there with them. I liked that it made me want to ring the boy's neck every once in a while for being so stupid; he isn't predictable. I am in awe how someone can create a living world with written words and wish I had an ounce of that talent. I'm just starting the second book and hope that it keeps up with the debut.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|I know that most people were not fans of The Best Damn Thing but I actually think it's very underrated. Most people accused Avril of selling out to the pop world and that she lost her punk attitude from the early years. First of all, Avril never said that she was punk rock to begin with and a lot of people forget that Avril was very young. She's an adult now and she just wants to be free and have fun and not take herself too seriously like she did on albums like Under My Skin, which features more darker songs. She didn't sell out, she's just growing and changing and she's doing it in a way that's not pretentious.<br /><br />Which brings me to this album. This album features her most personal songs to date. Dealing with fame and popularity and leaving behind her early years as well as moving on from the divorce from her husband. Avril is letting her fans come into her world and change with her. This music may be inspiring to others to leave behind their past as well and look to the future. Songs like I Love You, Everybody Hurts, Not Enough and Goodbye are beatutiful and uplifting, they may be sad at times but I think that it's very appropriate and it shows that Avril is just as human as anyone else. Still, this album isn't all meloncholy, it still has its fun and energetic songs like What The Hell and Smile. What I like about Avril is that she continues to change with each album, every album has new elements and it never sounds exactly like the last one.<br /><br />If you're intersted in coming into Avril's world and hear how her life has been the past couple of years then you can't go wrong with this album, she really invites you in with understanding and sensitivity.
B0036EH3U2|3.0|I bought all the series before seeing any of it earlier. The first and second seasons beats any previous Sci fi TV serie I have ever watched. Talking about Star treks; however starting the middle of the third season and up to the end of the fourth, the writers of the script were somehow lacking the right ideas and it became a mess.<br />Glad I watched it however \\"Star Trek Enterprise\\" beats it by far.
B002ZG999U|1.0|Definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only reason this tripe got squeezed through the sphincter of Hollywood and into theaters was because of Sly and his ability to get the majority of washed up action stars to costar. The dialogue is cringe worthy throughout. Bad script + bad acting = I want my money and my time back. I blame myself for even wanting to attempt to see this. I should have known going in that it would have been more entertaining to watch grass grow. At least grass can't say lame dialogue that can induce vomiting. The action teeters on cool and absolutely ridiculous. I wish I could say there is a redeeming quality to the film... but there's not.
0312600844|3.0|This is an essay, written like a novel; about society, politics & ideals; in the american contemporary life.<br /><br />The author uses the lifes of Patty & Walter, at different ages and at different status; to make the reader reflect at two levels:<br /><br />1. Our feelings towards the country (with different scenarios about the present and very rich in discussing the pendulum between liberalism and conservatism)<br />2. Our feelings about the family (in constant evolution, things are relative depending on your stage in life; but honesty and sincerity win as those are inner values in our culture).<br /><br />The book covers all; education, love & sex, music, nature, marriage & separation, business, corruption; and finally redemption. It skips religion and migration.<br /><br />In summary, I found the book very impactful as the more I read it, the more I got involved. In every single page, I ended up thinking about me and what is surrounding me at those two levels (country and family) too.<br /><br />Perhaps a couple of negatives to comment: too long chapters get you tired at times. Also, as I found Patty autobiography (first part of the novel) beatifully written and very entertaining; I also found the last part of the novel highly predictable.<br /><br />Get ready for deep thoughts when you start reading this book.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|great book, but did drag at a few places.  I am amazed at how people can run so much and so far and with a smile.  I have recently taken up running, and now barefoot running in my Five Fingers.  I am enjoying every minute of the runs I am on.  I am looking forward to my first marathon.  Enough about me though.  Buy the book, cause you won't regret it.  Great read.,
030746363X|3.0|You don't need to read the whole book. The author provides you with the chapters you need to read for the issues you are looking for
B003PIUBZS|5.0|First of all, to those who grumble about historical accuracy - seriously?!?! Does anything about this show suggest that that was the aim? Secondly, wow, this is probably the sexiest cast on television. Ladies, if you've been waiting for a show full of (gasp) male eye candy, here it is! Thirdly, it's a good story featuring some great performances. It's just sad that Andy Whitefield won't be back for season 2, as I'm having a hard time imagining anyone replacing him.........
1439163146|1.0|I came across the title PALO ALTO and thought it interesting since I reluctantly moved there as an early teenager and thankfully got out of there as soon as I graduated high school. When I realized it was written by James Franco, who, personally, I don't like or dislike, I was looking forward to a good read. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good read. It wasn't even an ok read. It was the same character pretending to be different characters telling different stories with the same tone and same language. It got quite boring and pointless after the 4th story. The only intriguing thing to me was that there was a lot of name dropping of places and streets in and around Palo Alto. Oh yeah, I remember the Bat Cave! Though I thought it was \\"The Path\\" where you could sneak a smoke (and catch your teacher too). I'm just a few years older than Franco and I certainly didn't experience teenage debauchery to this extent.    Palo Alto is a super wealthy and super conservative suburb full of doctors and Stanford professors. Most of the houses are enormous and expensive, half the cars are Mercedes, and the schools are exceptional because the city is loaded. A lot of teenagers became bored of being well to do and having status and high educational expectations to live up to. This didn't come across much at all in the book. These characters just seemed like average, stupid, overly sexed teenagers.    Aside from the location references, why was it even called Palo Alto?
B004N62KTG|5.0|I am not a HUGE Lady Gaga fan and yes this song has major \\"Express Yourself\\" qualities...BUT this song has a great hook and melody.  The lyrics are powerful and self expressive...and she supports the gay community which is more than I can say for a lot of musicians.  This song is just what it is...simple party music and the remixes are cool as well...As far as some people reviewing this single because they were waiting for her \\"swan song\\"  Have you not heard \\"Speechless\\"?  That song tears my heart out everytime I hear it...She is not the most sophisticated musician out there but she is what she is and that is a fine musician with a lot of talent...Enough said!!!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|The video and DTS audio quality far exceeds the broadcast quality as seen on PBS. Great cast - lots of surprises.  It is clear that the entire cast is having a great time and appreciate the performances of the others. Alfie Boe's performance certainly differs from Colm Wilkinson, but he is clearly up to the role. I think this concert will make him a household name. Nick Jonas has a sweet voice and face. He makes for an unassuming and naive Marius, but lacks the operatic quality heard in most of the cast.    My copy of the Blue-ray DVD contained no pamphlet, just the DVD. Is there supposed to be a pamphlet?
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Lots of characters thrown at you straight away so don't start this one unless you are peppy and alert!!! Great story with twists and turns and unexpected happenings. Big book definitely worth the read and the time. I can only hope the series on coming up on television is half as good as the book!
0670022411|5.0|I enjoyed it.  Kind of a cross between Davinci Code, Harry Potter, and a romance (Don't know any books in that Genre, so can't offer a comparison).
1594202842|1.0|This may be a memoir and not a parenting book, but why does the author sound so sure of herself as she describes her family's methods?
B003UESJFG|5.0|Loved Loved Loved this movie.  So much better than we anticipated it to be....My husband and I still greet each other with \\"O-low\\" or Hello, for those of you who have yet to watch it.... Definately in our top 10 for the year!
1423121708|5.0|This book is great on its own. Me and my nephew have read the books together and love the characters, acton and the monsters. With this version the book has pictures are very nice and my nephew loves them. Also the nice slipcover gives it a a place to keep safe. I would recomend this to any fan of the book.
014062029X|5.0|I got this book for a Literature class at the college. It was delivered quickly, and came in great condition. The pages seem a little thinner than would appear in a \\"better quality\\" books, but other then that, it's a great book for a great price. The story is fantastic.
0718154770|4.0|An excellent book that is easy to follow. Beware the 30 minutes starts from when all the ingredients and appliances have been assembled. A great buy
B000UJCALI|5.0|None of us would want to know what it is really like to go mad.  There are some exceptional sequences in this film.  There is a palpable sense of isolation, and Nicholson is particularly strong in the early and middle parts of the film when he is just starting to lose his mind, but is desperately trying to maintain his sanity, amidst the undercurrent of child abuse.  I don't want to know whether this is what it is like to go insane, but it sure convinced me.  There is a quiet scene when he asks his son to sit on his lap that is masterful in its understatement.  There is another scene in which Nicholson is on the verge of tears because it seems like he understands that he is actually losing his mind.  The parts of the film toward the end after Nicholson has gone completely mad and is on a rampage seem far less effective to me then the earlier parts of the film.  There are a lot of exceptional extras on this disc as well.
0789318121|1.0|The book cover is very deceiving. If you are a concept art enthusiast this book is NOT for you. The book's main focus is the SCRIPT , not the art. It features a few renders and and storyboard shots at the beginning of the book and quickly switches to just script. Which in my undeserving opinion has nothing to highlight (being unfair, I know).  If you just want the script I am sure you can search it online and save it as a 10Kb text file. No need for fancy misleading hardcover and paperstock. There.
1416575464|5.0|This is a fabulous book!! They took the best parts of each Domino Magazine (that I loved so much) and complied them into a pretty book.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie made me fear my plate. I completely changed how I shop for food after seeing this film. I'd like to see the same level of change at a social level as a result of this picture. Good luck to the producers.
B003Q6D25K|5.0|I loved this movie. I was a huge fan of the first one which I consider a classic. When I heard a sequel had been made I tried not to expect too much, maybe that's why I wasn't disappointed.     I won't bother giving a summary of the movie, as alot of the other reviews have done that already. I thought that the supernatural happenings started alot sooner than in the original and happened alot more frequently. I love the way tension is built through the buzzing / rumbling sound which can be heard every time something is going to happen. There were several times where I yelled out loud.    I think to enjoy this movie you have to forget about how good the first one is. Don't have fantastically high expectations and you won't be disappointed.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Heard some songs a friend had, so ordered the CD.  Wasn't crazy about it at first, but then it really grows on you.  Can't explain why, but I now love it.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I was never in to Batman until I saw Batman Begins, It was Amazing. I then bought the four Batman movies made before Batman Begins. The are all just ok, all the villains in them are a Joker copy, they don't stay true to their comic book characters. Then I saw The Dark Knight, how Christopher Nolan and the other writers write the Joker and how Heath Ledger plays him is what people needed. A different view of the Joker we have never seen, but yet stays true to the comics character. Christian Bale still gives a low voice like the first one, but that doesn't take away from the movie. Batman and Gordon's last speech in the movie is a Great example of self sacrifice by Batman. If you love Batman this is a Must Own. BUY IT FROM AMAZON NOW!!!!!! (One last note, the movie is very dark but that does not take away from it but adds to it.)
0307269981|5.0|Not only was the price excellent, the book itself was in superb condition. A+++<br /><br />This is the 2nd book in the trilogy featuring Lisbeth Salander. I'm waiting for the third to arrive so I can start it.
B004529NKC|5.0|The Dances are better in step up 3, now also in 3d. who would of thought a dance movie being in 3d not me. I did not see the movie in it's 3d format but after watching it's regular format. I think it would of been cool. The step up sereis are probably one of the best dance movie around. All three of them are awesome, great story, awesome dances, hot wemon, great music what else can you ask for in a dance movie. The Dances get more intense in this 3rd edition to the series and i would have to say the actor or dancer who did the robot was outstanding, they all were. I'm alway entertained by these movie.  If you have not seen this movie yet then i recommend that you do, you won't be disappointed
0545265355|5.0|The shipping was quick and the books are nice hard bound books. These books are about war and because of these they are violent. Good view of what war can be like to individuals.
B000EQ5SRK|3.0|not a good film or a good sleasey one. no where near the suspence of douglas\stone movie or the nudity.
B00377V6J2|4.0|I really enjoyed watching these two legendary guitar players play the blues. The CD is nice, allowing me to hear them when I can't view them. The interplay between them is a joy to see. I purchased this item on the strength of their names alone.    It was everything I had hoped for, and more. The two of them are in fine form on this one. It would be great if CD/DVD items featuring other guitarists were put together, say for example, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page.    Tom Raimondo
B004NOH9LW|3.0|I'm not going to write some kind of professional analysis of this movie. All I can say is that after seeing the trailers, it was not anything like what I was expecting.  I think people who like movies about death and dying are looking for one of two things - either an inspired answer to their questions, or a thrill.  This gave neither.<br /><br />I watched this just a couple of days after the Japan earthquake, so perhaps I was looking for something to answer that kind of devastation.  The special effects of the filming of this tsunami was good...perhaps the best part of the film.  But having subtitles while they spoke French was distracting and unnecessary since she spoke English during the rest of the movie. Between her, the child who loses his twin, and the psychic, there were three very interesting characters, but the storyline between the three just didn't make much sense.  Compared to Travolta's \\"City of Angels\\" or even \\"Michael\\", it didn't hold a candle. I'm not religious, so wasn't looking for that angle...I just wanted some new idea, new revelation about the afterlife, or at least a riveting story, and I'm afraid it didn't deliver any of them.<br /><br />I know it's politically incorrect to say so, but I think Clint Eastwood was a better actor than he is a filmmaker.  I don't recommend it unless you just want to watch a movie to pass the time. I'm glad I didn't pay $8 at the theatre to see it.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Very well done series; historically as accurate as one can tell; great acting; will need to see the series over and over to catch all the intricacies in the lives at court; Henry VIII proves the saying that there is no fool like an old fool=i put aging as he has been foolish about women all his life.
B00005NB8J|5.0|Seen all the tv episodes up to stargate universe season 2.  I love the ideas that have come out of it.
0446567337|5.0|I knew something tragic would happen in this story and I wasn't disappointed by what Nicholas Sparks decided to write in this love story. It caught me off guard that Savannah would end up marrying someone and that something would end up happening to her husband, but I had been expecting it to happen to either Savannah or John all along.<br /><br />I thought that even though both Savannah and John still loved each other, they would end up together in the end no matter what. I guess I was wrong because she ended up staying with Tim, a guy she married soon after she got tired of rarely seeing John after he went back to serving for his country. It turned out to be a shocker.<br /><br />I really recommend this book and I also recommend that you also read all of his other novels, such as \\"The Notebook\\", \\"Message in a Bottle\\", \\"A Walk to Remember\\", \\"The Rescue\\", \\"A Bend in the Road\\", \\"Night's in Rodanthe\\", \\"The Guardian\\", \\"True Beliver\\", and \\"At First Sight\\". Take my word, I guarantee it.
0545265355|5.0|I received this as a gift after mentioning the series to my mother. I devoured the entire series in four sittings. I don't understand why people have to critique every little detail. There are so many wonderful, unexpected twists and turns, well-developed, interesting characters, and such an original, mind-bending plot - not once was I thinking, \\"this sounds just like this and that book.\\" It's dark, heavy, and kept me on my toes. I cannot wait to see it transformed into a movie, so those that do not enjoy reading can be a part of this breathtaking world that sends an eyeopening message to every reader that looks between the lines.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This third book was definitely better than the second book by far, but still not as a good as the first book.  I felt like the author was speeding things up near the middle and end and the pace started to get too quick (almost like she had a deadline or she did not want to go over a certain amount of page numbers).  That was one thing I did not like about the book.    The second thing that I did not like is......SPOILER ALERT................was that the author had to kill all those children in the end, especially Prim, Katniss's sister.  I felt that it was a quick story line that did not fit well into the whole story.  The story was just about over, so why kill off children.  Now I am wondering how they are gonna portray that in a movie, unless they cut it out altogether.  It was all unneccesary and again, was so quick.  I felt like there was a different author for the end of the book.  If......SPOILER ALERT......President Coin had to die, there could have been another reason!      Overall, it was a good book until the end.  It could have been better.  I do recommend the trilogy though.
0375842209|5.0|I had heard about this book from a friend a couple years ago. I should have bought it and read it back then... I couldn't put it down. The way this book is written is truly amazing. Everything about it is... there are no words. A wonderfully written, haunting read.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I learned a lot about the story from the original book in this movie than I did from Let the Right One In. When I first heard they were gong to remake Let the Right One IN i figured it would be really bad but this is one of the very rare cases where I think the remake is as good, or in this case, even better, than the original. If I decide to watch the story again, which I will eventually, its more likely I'll watch Let Me In than Let the Right One IN.

0393338827|1.0|This is a pretty awful book.  Michael Lewis, after researching by reading a college kid's paper and then apparently not doing any more research not surprisingly has no idea what he is talking about.  He repeatedly (and bizarrely) flubs key, central concepts like CDO's and CDS, just explaining them completely wrongly.  It's not surprising that people who aren't familiar with these markets seem to find his explanations hard to understand -- it's because they are wrong and they make no sense!  And it's getting really silly after 25 years that he still trying to pass himself off as some kind of finance expert because he was low level grunt for a very short period in the mid-1980s at Salomon (which, by the way, wasn't nearly as important a firm then as he repeatedly claims it was in this book).  For no apparent reason at all, he even devotes an entire chapter at the end to reminding people he worked at Salomon for a couple years a generation ago.  Even if were actually doing anything interesting then, which he wasn't, the Wall Street of that era is nothing like the Wall Street of today, which is vastly different from the Wall Street of the housing bubble, which is way different from the Wall Street of the 1990's tech boom, which was way different from the Wall Street of the S&L period and aftermath.  On top of his technical incompetence in explaining what actually happened, the portraits of the people he chooses to focus on are as best as I can tell mostly fiction.  I know a number of the people he discusses, and in every case his characterizations of them are simply cartoonish and have almost no relationship to reality.  In general, the prose here is just painful at times, with his repeated attempts to draw big lessons from some minor thing somebody mentioned to him (or maybe didn't given how much of the personal stuff seems to be fiction).  There's actually a whole chapter where he's trying to explain Eisman as some kind of Spiderman-like presence on Wall Street because he apparently mentioned to Lewis that he liked Spiderman comics as a kid or something that is just miserable, awful, painful writing.e he apparently mentioned to Lewis that he liked Spiderman comics as a kid or something that is just miserable, awful, painful writing.
B000NY12LO|2.0|I usually love Picoult's book, but this one was a complete let-down. It started out promising, which is why I gave it two stars, and there were parts early on that were a heart-breaking portrayal of what could have possibly been going through the mind of a kid who ends up being the one behind a school shooting.    But...it's too predictable. Picoult reuses characters from a past book. She uses the same formula from her other books. Every character is a cliche, and most, a cliche she has already used before.    And the twist at the end? I completely did not buy it, and it left a horrible taste in my mouth that may have turned me off of books from this author in the future....
B001MYIXAC|3.0|I saw the American version first[Let Me In] and compared to that, I felt that this movie was slow in pace.  It is essentially the same story with slight differences.  I was a bit disappointed because reviews have said that this original is better than the remake but I found that the actors were dull.  I also thought that the \\"kill scenes\\" did not make sense. Like killing someone in the park where the trees are so sparse and lighting bright, or killing someone where anybody could see it and did. The way this was done in the American version made more sense and done with more suspense.  It was never hinted who the old guy with Eli (the girl vampire) is, until the end when the viewer will probably assume that he's been with her awhile.  This was done better in the American version when a photo of the girl and a boy who looks like the old guy was shown.  I expected this movie to be creepier but alas.  Maybe I'm biased.  It had some things that explained some questions I had with the American version like where does the girl get money to live.  The creepiest thing in this movie are the girl's eyes, and for me it wasn't enough.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Adele has music and I can't say that for every artist with a good voice. She is soulful, fun and strong on this album. At times there's a bit of similarity to the first album, yet at the same time an ability to show growth. I thoroughly enjoy listening. The first song grabs me, but there are others that relax me. She's not afraid to be classic either. It troubles me that so many so-called artists are viewed as soulful or artsy and put out the same stuff and then Adele puts out this album and gets limited airplay here in the states...
B0044RUSZM|3.0|I've owned this for 4 years, and for the most part it's been great. I logged on today to replace it. My MB Pro 13 inch has fallen off 4 or 5 times now when I've walked away from my desk. The most recent time it fell onto a concrete floor. At that point I decided it's worth it to replace this stand with the M-stand which has a lip to prevent your machine sliding down. It's served me well, but that costly flaw means it's not worth keeping.

030746363X|2.0|this is not a food plan that anyone can live on for life.  it's to restrictive, unrealistic.  if you have a lot of weight to lose, 50,60,70 or more pounds, you will lose weight simple by counting your calories and NOT eating junk food or drinking sugar laden drinks.  but if you're looking for someone to show you how to change your eating habits so you can live the rest of your life in a balance with food, this is not the book.  he seems to jump ship when he brings sexual pleasure in to this book.  not that i'm complaining it was the highlight of the whole book.  women should copy that part and give it to their partner.  who knows if you are satified in bed you might not eat so much junk food.
B000SQJ2JG|5.0|Now THIS is what I call underrated. Some people don't like Mk IV, but I think they stand on their own. The late Tommy Bolin did a nice job with the guitar and vocals. He's no Blackmore, but he still had some great musical skills when he joined Deep Purple in from 1975 to early 1976. Coverdale, Lord, Paice, and Hughes are typically brilliant with their bass, keyboards, drums, and vocals. The songs are top-notch from beginning to end. They're not perfect (like the ones in In Rock or Machine Head), but they can sure grow on you after the last song is done. \\"Dealer\\" and \\"I Need Love\\" are currently my personal favorites off of this album: both are musically magnificent. \\"Comin' Home,\\" \\"Lady Luck\\" and \\"Gettin' Tighter\\" are fantastic from beginning to end. \\"Drifter\\" and \\"Love Child\\" are 0% dull and 100% satisfying. \\"This Time Around\\" and \\"You Keep on Moving\\" are impressive closers for the album.<br /><br />This one has been getting some negative receptions from some of DP's most devoted fans (at least where I'm from). I will admit that this album isn't musically perfect, but it's not bad. In my opinion, it's just a few notches below In Rock, Machine Head, and Stormbringer. But it's better than Burn, and it's just as good as Who Do We Think We Are.

B000EF5NAS|4.0|This is a good movie  but not what I expected. I like Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates and the relationship between the two characters but did not like the story of the murder. I am glad I purchased this movie overall.
B002AF4Y96|5.0|I could start this review by just dropping Quentin Tarantino and Oliver Stone's names, which should sell the movie to nearly everyone; but doing so would not do this masterpiece justice.     Oliver Stone has a reputation of pushing the envelope in terms of content but also manages to sneak in subtle messages regarding society and popular culture in his films. He also captures the rich characters that have been elegantly written with great detail. Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis are excellent as Micky and Mallory, two young lovers who embark on a no-holds-barred killing spree, all the while being pursued by law enforcement as well as the media. As the film progresses, Micky and Mallory become unlikely heroes as their brutal actions are sensationalized by the media.    While it is difficult to refer to Micky and Mallory as protagonists in Natural Born Killers because they are obviously sociopaths, it is difficult not to root for them at some points because of their uncompromising love for each other.    Two other characters worth mentioning are those portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. and Tommy Lee Jones who play a reporter following Mickey and Mallory and a prison warden, respectively. Downey Jr.'s character does an excellent job of showing his true talent as an actor. His character personifies the media, and how it can sensationalize even the most brutal, psychotic criminals and make them celebrities. Jones' character plays the opposite role, in a futile pursuit of justice.    Natural Born Killers is in the same vein as True Romance (not a surprise considering they were both written Quentin Tarantino). Its an action movie, a love story, and a satirical view of human nature and good vs evil. The film contains strong violence, sexual material, and graphic language. It is not appropriate for small children, and those who are easily offended. However, I think that Natural Born Killers is a highly underrated film. I feel as though the title, as well as the content have caused this movie to be passed over as a mindless excuse for gratuitous violence. It may take a few times watching the film from beginning to end to truly appreciate the nuances and complexities of this film, but in the end it is well worth it.    In closing, of all the versions of this film that are available, the Unrated Directors Cut on Blu Ray is by far the best version. The special features are listed in the product description, but they are all worth owning. But this movie, keep it out of reach of children, and enjoy a great piece of film-making!
0061537969|5.0|I absolutley loved this book!  It made me laugh and it made me cry and there were a couple of times I even cheered Enzo the Dog! It touches some of the most basic emotions in a profound way.  If you are a dog lover/owner, you will never look at your dog the same way again.  Now I catch myself looking at my dog and wonder what he's thinking. Even if you don't think that this is something you would be interested in,(I didn't. I read it on a friend's recommendation.)try it, you won't be able to put it down. I couldn't, my husband had to take it away from me!!
B00003CXGG|4.0|Jet Li had been kickin' arse and takin' names long before he played the scary Big Bad in LETHAL WEAPON 4, but it's exactly that gig that got him his first lead in a Hollywood action picture. ROMEO MUST DIE is self-described as a \\"hip hop kung fu movie,\\" as apt a description as any. This flick has got one overriding flaw, but mostly it's entertaining as heck.<br /><br />Shakespeare's classic tragedy is given that urban flavor and that martial arts twist. The story's backdrop concerns the blood feud between two ill-fated houses in Verona... er, Oakland, California. When word of his brother's murder in Oakland reaches an incarcerated ex-policeman named Han Sing (Jet Li), he promptly breaks out of his Hong Kong prison and makes his way to the U.S. There, he has a chance meeting with the beautiful Trish O'Day (Aaliyah), daughter of the local mob boss. Circumstances play out and we learn that Han is the son of an Asian crime family engaged in a turf war against the O'Day syndicate. It doesn't stop Han and Trish from becoming good friends.<br /><br />Aaliyah and Jet Li demonstrate this sweet, oddball chemistry, although I don't know that they made that convincing a romantic couple. It seems more like what they share is a platonic relationship. Aaliyah lights up the screen in her film debut, and I still get sad whenever I think of that plane crash. But you watch her in this movie and you can tell she's got what it takes. The supporting cast has her back. Delroy Lindo lends weight and credibility as the head of the O'Day mob. Russell Wong - whom I really liked in those VANISHING SON television films - plays the right hand man to the Asian Mafia's boss. Bow down to Russell Wong's good looks. He always seems to get these roles that call for someone sleek and sophisticated, and Russell always looks as cool as the other side of the pillow. His character is Han's longtime friend, but time apart can inflict changes in a friendship. With friends and loved ones from both crime families being targeted, who can be trusted? If you gaze at the unctuous Isaiah Washington - who plays O'Day's right hand man - and your eyes don't naturally narrow with suspicion, then you're not reading the signals too well. Look to your own houses, gangstas.<br /><br />It ticks me off a bit that it took until LETHAL WEAPON 4 before people here got wise to Jet Li and what he brings. Because his Hong Kong martial arts films are epic stuff. Here he shows off his kung fu, and jacks up a horde of western thugs. He even indulges in a rough game of football at the park. Anthony Anderson - who as Trish's undesired bodyguard provides the film's comedy relief - gets repeatedly beat up by Jet. The action set pieces are pretty good, except that they're undermined by the overzealous wire-fu. Some of the crazy moves that Jet and Russell Wong pull just look unconvincing, and this affected how much I enjoyed the film. Anyway, this soup of hip hop and martial arts worked well enough that the formula was recycled three years later for CRADLE 2 THE GRAVE, a film which also reunited Jet Li, Anthony Anderson, and DMX (who has a cameo in ROMEO MUST DIE as a club owner).<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff is thick with short documentaries:<br /><br />- HBO First Look Special: the Making Of ROMEO MUST DIE featurette (00:14:49 minutes long)<br />- \\"Inside the Visual Effects Process\\" - about the \\"ultra pain mode\\" f/x which occasionally pops up in the movie; the \\"ultra pain mode\\" is a digitally-rendered x-ray vision sequence which depicts the internal damage Jet inflicts on his antagonist (00:03:50)<br />- \\"Diary of a (Legal) Mad Bomber\\" - about the film's practical effects (00:04:50)<br />- \\"Anatomy of a Stunt\\" - with professional stunt woman Melissa Stubbs as she performs a descender drop from a highrise, a high fall, and a fall right into the drink; this is a pretty cool featurette accompanied by pop up trivia (00:06:50)<br />- \\"The Sound Stage\\" - about the film's sound mix, that which provides balanced levels of dialogue, special sound effects, and score (00:01:32)<br />- \\"Stairway Dance\\" - behind the scenes at filming Jet's stairway tussle (00:01:34)<br />- \\"Kung Fu Football\\" - shooting the football at the park sequence (00:02:36)<br />- \\"A Benz, a Bike, a Babe and Some Badasss Kung Fu\\" - behind-the-scenes of the 4-minute car chase and Jet & Aaliyah's dance-fu (00:03:44)<br />- \\"The Hose\\" - shooting the scene where Jet uses a fire hose as a weapon (00:02:48)<br />- \\"Master on Fire\\" - shooting the climactic fight scene between Han and Kai (00:02:22)<br />- \\"Jet Li is 'Han'\\" - an interview with Jet as he talks about the film (00:03:33)<br />- \\"Aaliyah is 'Trish'\\" - an interview with Aaliyah (00:05:01)<br />- \\"Anthony Anderson is 'Maurice' aka 'Moron'\\" - an interview with Anthony  (00:02:58)<br />- 2 music videos - Aaliyah's \\"Come Back in One Piece\\" featuring DMX and \\"Try Again\\" featuring Jet Li<br />- the Making Of Aaliyah's \\"Try Again\\" music video (00:04:14)<br />- Cast & Crew credits & filmographies<br />- ROMEO MUST DIE theatrical & international trailerss balanced levels of dialogue, special sound effects, and score (00:01:32)<br />- \\"Stairway Dance\\" - behind the scenes at filming Jet's stairway tussle (00:01:34)<br />- \\"Kung Fu Football\\" - shooting the football at the park sequence (00:02:36)<br />- \\"A Benz, a Bike, a Babe and Some Badasss Kung Fu\\" - behind-the-scenes of the 4-minute car chase and Jet & Aaliyah's dance-fu (00:03:44)<br />- \\"The Hose\\" - shooting the scene where Jet uses a fire hose as a weapon (00:02:48)<br />- \\"Master on Fire\\" - shooting the climactic fight scene between Han and Kai (00:02:22)<br />- \\"Jet Li is 'Han'\\" - an interview with Jet as he talks about the film (00:03:33)<br />- \\"Aaliyah is 'Trish'\\" - an interview with Aaliyah (00:05:01)<br />- \\"Anthony Anderson is 'Maurice' aka 'Moron'\\" - an interview with Anthony  (00:02:58)<br />- 2 music videos - Aaliyah's \\"Come Back in One Piece\\" featuring DMX and \\"Try Again\\" featuring Jet Li<br />- the Making Of Aaliyah's \\"Try Again\\" music video (00:04:14)<br />- Cast & Crew credits & filmographies<br />- ROMEO MUST DIE theatrical & international trailers
1439102724|1.0|I have read all of Picoult's books.  I am always intrigued and impressed at the amount of research she does on a wide variety of interesting topics.  Clearly, she knows little to nothing about Christians, and didn't bother to ask a true believer their opinion on same-sex relationships.  Christians are not haters, they believe that we are all broken vessels.  Each time I lose patience with my children, or speak cruelly or disrepectfully to my husband, I have failed and fallen short.  I, nor is anyone else, in a position to hate.  However, the Bible is incredibly clear that same-sex relationships are wrong, just as me losing my patience with my children is wrong, just as infidelity is wrong, just as being jealous is wrong.  However, no Christian I have ever come in contact with would ever stand in a picket line with such incredibly hateful messages, or they would be clearly contradicticting the Bible.      I did not appreciate the one-dimensional, awful portrayal of Christians.  It is just as offensive to me to be slandered in this way as it is for your characters in the book to be slandered for their sexual orientation.  The fact that this intelligent writer can't see the hypocrisy in this is astonishing.  I am livid I bought this book.      On top of the offensiveness, it is by far one of the most boring books I have ever read. Everything seems undeveloped and SLOW.
B001DD63UO|5.0|I had to give Pink a chance.  I do not care for her vulgarity but love her songwriting ability.  She is a true musician.  I love that you get the essence of her music in this CD without all of the vulgarity, and I can listen to it in mixed company.  Pink will be in my listening collection for a long time to come.
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|This movie was not horrible. It was decent. I don't know why when there is a sequel it will come out very quickly after the first and is poorly written. If there is to be third movie for this I think I will wait until it comes on cable

B004132HZS|4.0|Unlike Guy Ritchie's re-imagining of Sherlock Holmes this is actually very watchable. I watched it with my nine-year-old daughter and we both very much enjoyed it. This vision of Sherlock, while updated to modern times, is much more true to the original than Ritchie's action movie garbage. I would recommend it.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|When is the sequeal coming out. Surely this talented author wont leave us hanging. Please Ms. Harkness continue this wonderfully crafted tale.  I am an historical fiction junky and alover and seeker of the occult past and present.  I couldnt put this novel down.
1591843790|5.0|Guy Kawasaki knows a thing or two about building an audience and a market for your product. The first Apple Evangelist, a frequent keynote speaker, Guy rubs shoulders with the best in Silicon Valley. This book is a valuable distillation of his wisdom and is delivered in his irreverent, humorous style. The chapter \\"How to prepare\\" is excellent - that alone is worth the price of the book. \\"Make it short, simple and swallowable\\" Good advice  - which I follow here.   Alison van Diggelen, Host of Fresh Dialogues
B003L20IFQ|4.0|The most impressive thing about BURIED is the incredibly surprising emergence of Ryan Reynolds as an actor to be reckoned with.  Usually associated with mindless fluff like THE PROPOSAL, VAN WILDER, WAITING etc., Reynolds is astonishing as our imprisoned hero.  Extremely limited physically, Reynolds uses his face and voice to exhibit his desperate situation.  Director Roberto Cortes likewise uses his limitations brilliantly--no flashbacks or syrupy sidebars.  He makes his audience squirm along with Reynolds even plunging us into uncomfortable darkness and giving us an unexpected ending.<br /><br />BURIED is unconventional film but definitely a powerful one.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|** SPOILERS WITHIN **  This is a what if tale of a medical breakthrough in 1952 that helps people live beyond 100 by the late 60s.  What is that medical breakthrough?  Cloning.  People are cloned and those clones are mentally conditioned to accept their destiny as giving their body parts to let others live longer.  You'll last through about three or four surgeries typically before you expire, or, as they term it: completion.  Even though the clones do all the things humans (i.e. love, worry, cry, compose art, think of their futures) they are chillingly determined to have no souls and are in a sense slaves of the New World.  The focus isn't upon explaining how this world all came about nor some rebellion against the New Order but instead the fatalistic acceptance of the destiny of the clones.  Unsurprisingly, this tale ends tragically.  Some audiences will likely shrug this off as make believe but as I mentioned in my review of the novel things like this have happened or are happening in the world.  There's a Middle Eastern Prince who flies around the world on his private jet and pays people off for a kidney and then there was that relatively recent tale of someone doing the same thing in NYC (who got it from some poor person in South America).  People act like there would be an uproar but I'm not entirely sure of that belief.  What about all those cheap things we get at Walmart?  A lot of those are made overseas by people who pretty much suffer under slave labor and/or slave wages.  Anyway, the tale was a bit slow and idyllic for my tastes but it was thought provoking and that is something few movies do these days.  CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus;   THOUGHT PROVOKING POTENTIAL: A; WHEN WATCHED: mid March; MY GRADE: B to B plus (less if you don't like gloomy tales).
B004AKCME8|3.0|I prefer animated movies that make me laugh and don't require a scorecard to keep up with the characters' names.<br />LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS is beautifully done--the owls are humanized well and the voice actors do good work.<br />But I found myself bored and grew tired of the battles.  It's also way too predictable and nothing made me laugh.  The addition of teen-oriented pop doesn't add anything to the film.<br />It's also kind of violent for younger kids who are obviously its target audience.  The escape of Nyra the queen of the Pure Owls sets up a sequel, but I hope they let that idea go.
B003MC5N28|2.0|The is just right for middle-school aged children.  It's the idea that by getting rid of the 'bad', such as war, starvation, and suffering, will inadvertently get rid  the 'good' , such as beauty, love, and relationships.    However, the vehicles used to prove that idea are lacking.  12 year old boys do not worry about their careers; 12 year old boys do not plot a runaway for the sake of a baby; it is not remotely convincing that thousands of memories would come over a community because one person left.  The thought behind this book is inadequate.    Brave New World has more thought behind it and gets the same idea across.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|DVD shows the live performance Avenged Sevenfold put on in Long Beach California. Great footage and the CD, Diamonds in the Rough, has some really great songs that make it worthy of looking in to. Both are a great buy for a good price.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|David Baldacci, as usual, has an excellent command of the English language and his plot doesn't have 'gaps' in it.  He doesn't call things by the wrong name because he didn't properly research them and the story does not have contradictions that he just skipped over and hoped the reader doesn't notice.  The reader is not left saying \\"But what about...\\"  He does, however, use his lit-license to adjust historical facts in order to move his story along- he even tells the reader he did it to improve the story and not because he's an idiot.    I will not explain the plot, because other reviewers have already written about it in detail.  I will mention that the characters have depth; each character has his or her own quirks and multiple aspect that make up his or her personality.  The writing style is captivating and urges the reader to keep turning pages.    Nothing is perfect, but Amazon will not let me choose 4.8 stars...
0060987464|5.0|I made the mistake of opening this book to read as soon as I received it in the mail.  I could not put it down, I was up until 2 a.m. reading, and to put this in perspective I get up at 4 a.m. every morning. It is too bad MM doesn't write more, he is an excellent author.  In a word, mesmerizing.
0887307280|1.0|This book is all about the doom and gloom of owning a business. It is quick to describe the flaws in small business ownership, but does not offer any solutions to common issues of owning a small business.<br /><br />The only business example used in this book is about a pie shop owner and her trials. It does not offer generalized business strategies and ways to succeed in any type of business.<br /><br />I do not recommend this book, if you are planning on strengthening your business, I recommend hiring a business coach!
B00262T4YS|2.0|Very formulaic and unbelievable.  Thought it was rather shallow and superficial.  I don't know about you, but from the time I saw that projected map of the US, I'd be asking a million questions.  She seems to be exceptionally uninquisative.  Who would send someone a zillion miles on an anthropoligical research mission, and then pick them up in three days, lest they die?  Makes no sense.  I hate to start a movie, and not finish it, but it was a real effort to finish this one.      I love 1970s movies though, the country is so uncrowded, and the cops are so lumbering.      One of the stars is because I love the Barney-Fife / Gomer-Pyle attitude that Bridges uses.  Pure dork.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|My husband and I make a nest of pillows and blankets, pop some popcorn and savor each episode of Dr. Quinn that we once watched back in the 90s. It's satisfying, romantic and poignant.
B002VECMAE|4.0|Well, I am. I'm wondering after reading the other reviews if anybody gets it? I loved this move, really funny. I got a huge kick out of this movie. IMHO I believe you should add this movie to your collection. I'm glad I did. PS I thought the end was good but a little like a Carlos Castaneda book. In fact, I thought the whole idea for the movie was taken from The Teachings of Don Juan but hey, that's just me.<br />Bear
B002ZG99N6|3.0|The good - chase and heist scenes are superbly done, acting is fine, the late Peter Posltethwaite is fantastic in basically a cameo role and the movie is the right length (I haven't seen the extended version)and it will hold your attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />The bad - there are far too many cliches and implausible moments.<br />For example:<br />1. Armed bank robber who really has a heart of gold and tries to control his ultra violent friend to whom he owes a favour.<br />2. Guy wants to escape his life of crime but his friends and boss won't let him go.<br />3. Girl falls for wrong guy, finds out and rejects him only to help him later when he is in need.<br />4. Guy betrayed by girl he rejects for another.<br />5. The ending is silly but predictable and leaves room for a sequel.<br /><br />See what I mean. If you've never seen \\"Heat\\" or \\"Ronin\\" I suggest you do so and see what can be done in this genre.<br /><br />That said if you like crime movies, car chases and heist scenes this will be a 90 minutes well spent.
0740785508|4.0|In order to draw or paint a realistic scene, it is better to paint from an actual 3D scene, rather than a photo, or a flat scene contrived in illustrator or Photoshop, because what makes realistic scenes arresting is the way they draw you into their depth, and it is easier to depict this depth when painting from 3D rather than 2D.<br /><br />This book is full of all sorts of suggestion abou how to set up 3D models to help in depicting things and settings which do not exist.  While the author has a certain style and typical content, that is not what the book is about.  The imaginative ideas can be applied to any individual style. You can even use the suggestions for setting up scenarios of things which do exist but which you do not have in front of you.
B002ZG976U|4.0|The film itself is AMAZING. But I took away a star because of the special features.  When I buy a DVD, I look at the special features first to see if it's worth buying.  The special features look so good on the box that I bought it right away.  But sadly, I was mistaken.    SPECIAL FEATURES  -6 Exclusive Song Performances  I thought this meant NEW performances that didn't appear in the film.  But sadly, that just meant performances of \\"Something's Got A Hold On Me (Dancers Version)\\" (which is just the instrumental opening number), Kristen Bell's uncut performance of \\"Long John Blues\\", uncut performances of \\"Express\\" and \\"A Guy What Takes His Time\\", the Alan Cumming number \\"That's Life\\" and another number.  The \\"uncut\\" performances were fine the way they were in the film, I didn't need them \\"uncut\\", I would've preferred NEW performances  -Alternate Opening  Where Christina Aguilera performs \\"Something's Got A Hold On Me\\" right when the movie starts without interruptions and then the film takes on from there, with her counting the tips on the bar with the other lady  -Blooper Reel  Nothing much I can say besides it's pretty funny. I always like gag reels haha  -Director's Commentary  Not really into commentary, but I'll watch it with that...soon..    LANGUAGES  -English, English Audio Description  -English, English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles      Overall I can forgive the movie for it's lack of special featuures because the movie itself is SOO amazing.
1580176941|1.0|If I could give a negative star I would. What a HUGE disappointment! I puchased this book after reading all the rave reviews. That was my first mistake. My second mistake was not returning this dust collector. I'm in agreement with one of the reviews (a 3 star if I remember correctly) 'pretty cover'. Don't waste your money! This book has nothing to offer; not even for someone in baking 101.
B004P9FAL6|1.0|I guess I shouldn't be surprised. As you know, Warner Brothers has officially announced the Ultimate Editions of years 5 and 6. The product descriptions are quite wordy. There's a lot of talk about how fans should be excited about these new releases. But there are two words missing from the descriptions of both these products: Extended Cut.    What sold me and so many other fans was the extended cuts. And so I began collecting the Ultimate Editions. And what excited me even more was the idea of more extended cuts to come, especially for The Order of the Phoenix.     Then Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblit of fire Ultimate Editions came out, and of course, there were no extended cuts. And Warner Bros. spun us a tale of directors and their creative preferences. And so, we all said \\"fair enough\\" (although I, for one, never quite bought that explanation). Still, I had hopes for Order of the phonex and Half blood prince. Director David Yates is on record talking about having to cut 45 minutes from The Order of the Phoenix. And yet, here we are again with no extended cut to speak of. I'm sure the studio will spin us a tale of how busy Yates has been with the final installment of the franchise, thus making it impossible to return to these previous films and give the fans what they want,AN EXTENDED CUT.    I understand Warner Bros. desire to get these editions on the shelves before the final film hits theaters. As for me, I would gladly wait a year for these editions if it meant getting to see extended cuts of the films. But this is not about the fans. This is about the bottom line. If the WB can get a half-@$$ product onto the shelves sooner, and therefore presumably make more money in the final season of Potter movie mania, then who cares what the fans want? We will buy anything with the word Ultimate in front of it. Or maybe not.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|First off, and Ill probably get flamed for it- I enjoyed Independence Day. It was a fun popcorn movie if a bit on the campy side. In my opinion, camp has a place in Hollywood just as much as serious fare and try to tell me watching the aliens getting their asses kicked at the end wasn't a rush.<br /><br />Now on the flip side, we have Battle: Los Angeles. No silliness, lasers or crusading presidents. Instead we have a platoon of trained marines doing their job. The authenticity of their demeanor and weapons usage (thanks to their actual marine training) shown through every frame. Within the first few minutes you actually believe they are the real deal.<br /><br />I also appreciated the \\"authentic\\" look of the aliens. No sleek fighters, laser guns or big headed aliens, these buggers are a nasty melding of organic and mechanics almost like marines themselves (a view shared early on).<br /><br />Interspersed through the proceedings, it is revealed or at least placed forward what they want and how they intend to get it. Of course they didnt take into consideration the chutzpah of the US Marines- a mistake they pay dearly for.<br /><br />As a Scifi connoisseur and lover of authenticity in war movies (Platoon, Saving Private Ryan etc) this is by far the most real feeling alien invasion movie in memory. Watch it and by the end, you'll be almost as exhausted as they are.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|don't get me wrong.  it was a really good book, even to the end, but i just expected a little more out of the story line towards the end.  definitely worth the read, regardless :)))
B004E547D8|3.0|[[ASIN:B004E547D8 Red (Movie-Only Edition) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />First: this movie is just plain fun, an action confection which coasts comfortably on the charisma of its familiar stars.  I contend that anyone who judges it really harshly is being way too serious.<br /><br />And I was perfectly happy to buy a reduced-price movie-only Blu-ray release.  The DVD extras are only rarely something I'm actually interested in.  I just wanted a good-quality transfer of the feature at a reasonable price.<br /><br />That's where things went wrong.  The video transfer was... perfectly okay.  But I didn't believe my eyes (and ears, once the movie started): this Blu-ray includes only nasty, muffled old low-bitrate lossy Dolby Digital audio tracks.  You know, the kind you thought were a thing of the past once you switched to a format with the bandwidth of Blu-ray.<br /><br />That's just completely cheesy and unacceptable.  This film would've been far more engaging if the sound transfer had been up to snuff.
0756404738|5.0|As a lover of true beauty, beauty that shines all the way from within, I was swept away with Kvothe by the wind that sends him on a path as straight as a leaf's path to the ground on an autumn day.  The shaping of his character was eloquently done, sometimes through a gentle summer breeze and sometimes the winds of a storm.      Through the book, Kvothe is able to maintain his core beauty, while also having to surrender to the reality of hard truths and hard decisions.  In this, we see his childish moral gray areas mature into adult beliefs and resolve.      I was able to fall head first in to the story and found that I was unexpectedly fulfilled at the end of the book, despite all the things I wanted to know. I feel Bast's fear that the wind has died and we are truly witnesses to a tragedy.     Even if it is a tragedy, I cannot wait to witness this evolved Kvothe doing what he was incapable of doing as a mere child. And despite the fear I share with Bast, I think there is going to be a sharp turn in the weather.     I just get the feeling that a tornado is coming, and its name is going to be Kvothe.     Yeah, I just said that.  I can't wait.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Set for a November 2010 release, Terrence Malick's long gestating The Tree of Life, starring Brad Pitt and Sean Penn, is our pick for the year's big Oscar film. The details of the production have been kept as secret as any major production ever, word slipping here and there that the film is the product of nearly three decades of writing by Malick. The production is said to be huge and the post-production as labored-over as any. All that said, we at ScreenTime refuse to believe that Tree's production will match that of the just released new Christopher Nolan film, Inception, surely another big Oscar film.     Where to begin? Inception, Nolan's seventh proper feature, is the British-American auteur's biggest, strangest, most promoted, most anticipated and most memorable work yet. Opening this past weekend at No. 1 with over $60 million in US sales, I left the theater wondering three things about the dreamy heist flick: 1) how many people in the theater with me were able to follow not just the bombastic action, but the delicate storyline?; 2)  How the f%#@ do you write something like that?; and 3) which of ScreenTime's favorite directors saw this film? Malick? Tarantino? Scorcese? Spielberg?! What did they think of it? This, I'd love to know.     I wasn't alive when Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi epic 2001: A Space Odyssey was released, but I can still watch it today and feel its power and originality, every time wondering how it made Kubrick's contemporaries feel. My guess is that it made them all realize that they needed to think harder and work harder. Even if your name is Spielberg and you made an epic production called Saving Private Ryan, Inception likely has a similar 2001 effect on you. More than Star Wars in 1977 or Avatar just last year, Inception just feels bigger, grander, more labored over and \\"next level\\" than anything of recent memory. Films likes Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Tarantino's original Kill Bill cut, Nolan's own The Dark Knight and even Malick's own The Thin Red Line are humbled by the mastery and creativity of Inception.     That said, Inception is not the best film of 2010. Not in our book. It may be the best made film of 2010, but a better film, Jacques Audiard's Un Prophete, has already been released and there are a couple coming yet (Tree, mostly), that stand to be better. After such a rant about the brilliance of Inception, how can I already say such a thing? Well, many reasons. For starters, Inception is an often tedious film. Using a chopped-up non-linear storytelling device, Nolan has made an extraordinarily cerebral caper film that's dressed up as a big summer blockbuster. There's enough action to make Sly Stallone blush, which is cool, but there's also an awful lot of important dialogue. You have to hear every word in the film so much so that, in fact, if you simply sneeze at the wrong parts of the film, you'll miss something that could maybe spoil your complete understanding of what's going on. (Tedious is the word I keep coming back to, even if I'm uncomfortable using such a negative word to describe such a masterful work.) If you've not yet seen the movie, imagine sitting in a theater for 150 minutes, paying close attention to every word and movement, never more than a 10 second break for a joke or two. Plan to walk out of the theater with a fried brain, dropped jaw and crossed eyes.     But hey, let's not knock an artist for being wildly ambitious. We're cool with Inception frying our brain. And, aside from that, we have very few issues with the movie. Sure, the setup (basically, these dudes gotta crack into this younger dude's dreams and plant an idea in this his mind before he turns his dad's company into a Wal-Mart-like monster) is incredibly underbaked compared to what follows, but that's no big deal. And the casting, aside from Marion Cotillard (who is perfect), seems a bit off, Leonardo DiCaprio's Dom Cobb seeming a bit too similarly played to his recent Shutter Island character, Teddy Daniels. The still-very-young-feeling Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the mature daddy of the operation? And Ellen Page as the big brain who makes things happen? Ummm.     Now let's focus on the good things. First and foremost is the writing, which is brilliant. People who write as well as Nolan usually write long, details novels - and Inception could've easily been a mini-series. But Nolan thinks equally in movement and vision, and we're the luckier for it. His writing, especially in Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight, has always been impressive, but here he makes his mark. The amount of detail and thought put into this puzzle of a story is mind-blowing. Look for Nolan to grab an Oscar nomination - and maybe statue - for his original screenplay. No. 2 on the list of things Inception does impossibly well is editing. You have to see it twice to believe it. Telling a story like this on paper is hard enough, but taking moving pictures of it, adding sound and music and CGI, then cutting it all up non-linear-style and making sense of it is the hardest part of the process.  Editor Lee Smith, known mostly for his work with Peter Weir, will win 2010's Oscar for Best Editing. He should've won it in 2008 for The Dark Knight, in 2006 for The Prestige and maybe even in 2005 for Batman Begins, but he will win it in 2010.     There's much more to say about the tedious but brilliant, visually inventive yet action-packed new Christopher Nolan movie, but let's not get carried away. It's just a movie. It's just the movie that deserves all of the attention Avatar received last year but won't (this because it makes you think too hard). It's just the movie that (fingers crossed) might change the way Hollywood studios treat big brain artists with big ideas. For a while, anyhow. And we have Christopher Nolan and his brilliant new sci-fi mindbender to thank.
0131177052|5.0|For a short review I believe this book gives what you expect exactly. Contains applicable techniques, demonstrated on realistic examples. Not just a bunch of ideas and theories put on ideal examples.    If you're working on a legacy code base, and hating your work, I strongly suggest reading this book. As it will both ease your work and motivate you to do your job better and less frustrated.
B004NOH9LW|5.0|This is a story about connectivity - about how all of us are connected to everything and about how we all will share a common fate, regardless of how we were brought into this world.    Most people will call this \\"a really deep movie\\", but it's not. It's so simple it will go over your head. It's the warmth of the sunshine in a midsummer's morning - something we all take for granted and rarely stop to really appreciate it.    I say bravo, Mr. Eastwood, and bravo to the cast and crew. Together, you made something beautiful.     Life is simple. We make it complicated.
0316044938|5.0|some women can't get past the beginning of the novel, but once past it, you'll find just how wonderful this book truly is.  one of my favorites.
0316098337|4.0|At first I was a little put off by repetetive nature of the little boy's descriptions of his confined world.  It was a little too much, I worried that the whole book would go on in this way.  It didn't.  The beginning is really very necessary to set up the rest of the book and once you get into the flow of the story you won't be able to put it down.  This book has gotten a lot of hype, but I think it is well deserved.  It is a uniquely told story that will have you thinking about its themes for days, even weeks after you have finished.  It lends itself to an excellent book club discussion.  Try taping an 11 x 11 square on your living room floor and having your book club sit inside it for the discussion.
0756404738|5.0|I have to say it: I hated this book from beginning to end. And the more I read, the more I hated Patrick Rothfuss, too.    Why?    I couldn't get a lick of work done when I had this book in hand. The entire world seemed to fade into the background. I stayed up WAAAAAY too late.     And as someone who writes fiction part time, I was terribly, terribly jealous. Because Rothfuss has the uncanny ability... to make his prose sing. I mean it - really SING, almost a sweetly as you'd imagine the main character to sing. The whole book transforms from being elegant prose into musical poetry.     It's really very frustrating.     And while I've heard some people say it paled in comparison to Name of the Wind, here is what I say - oooh please. Since the history of the book series, when have people NOT said such things? Take it with a grain of sand.    I loved this book. The characters were well fleshed out, the plot was so thick you could cut it with a knife. When something emotional took place, you felt it. Right to your bones.     This is a masterpiece, in my opinion. And when we're finally gifted with the third installment, I hope it will be remembered as a classic of fantastic literature.    But I still wish he wasn't so damn good.    Best,    Angel    PS. I did not put certain things about the plot and such into this review. Many other reviewers have done so. Honestly, at almost 1,000 pages... there is far too much plot and too many things going on.    Suffice to say, it's a great book. You'll enjoy it in some way, if you're fond of Patrick's previous work.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|Director Sam Mendes, the man responsible for modern classics American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, almost always seems to know what he's doing, be it heavy (Road to Perdition) or light (Away We Go). This is why his 2005 war film, Jarhead, is such a disappointment. The concept of the film is great and the cinematography is, at times, as beautiful as you'll see in a war film. But damn, some of the attempts to make the film seem ... err ... hip, are embarrassing. The incessant use of unfitting, of-its-time music - used as an attempt to keep the movie light and fun - is so blatant and annoying that you can't help but cringe. The playful moments amongst the Marines who make up the story of this film are borderline cheesy. Actually, they're not borderline anything - they're flat out cheese.     This is a shame because, aside from the then-hip casting of leadman Jake Gyllenhaal (at the time a sudden cult figure thanks to Donnie Darko), the casting was great. The writing was great. The production was great. These few small mistakes keep Jarhead from being the best war film of the Naughts.     The story of Jarhead is simple. Our hero, Anthony Swofford (Gyllenhaal in his first major studio lead role), joins the Marines just as Operation Desert Shield is about to hit. He spends a lot of time adjusting and questioning what he's doing, but even more time wondering what his girlfriend is doing back home. (We're made to feel like this girlfriend of his is his everything - amusing, considering the character is 20 years old.) At the urging of Seargent Sykes (Jamie Foxx), Swofford becomes a Marine sniper, which he is very good at. He's he part of an ace team of shooters, paired with the always excellent Peter Sarsgaard, as Cpl. Alan Troy.     The crew of Marines, led in rank by Sykes and spirit by Troy, almost never appear scared. Aside from Skarsgaard, who leads the way as far as acting, Lucas Black (as Chris Kruger) stands out. He's a Texas boy who goes back and forth between airhead and the most reasonable man in his squad. At one point, when the Marines are discussing the point of the war, Kruger puts it straight: \\"I know these oil guys; I've been around them all my life. They drink oil like water. This is a war about money; we're here to keep the oil cheap.\\"     No one believes him. Later in the film, when the soldiers are told to sign a waiver and take an untested pill that can supposedly fight the side effects of nuclear weapons, Kruger again stands up, spitting the pill out after fighting with Sykes. These are some of the most memorable scenes, not only because of the subject matter, but because Black (who most know as the young, twangy boy in Sling Blade), is a heck of an actor.     But don't get excited, this isn't an overly political film. There are points made here and there, but, mostly, the film attempts to show what it was like to be a Marine during Operation Desert Shield. The movie moves slow as we watch the Marines sit and wait. They foolishly hope for action as the days pass. There are side stories here and there (watching porn together, sneaking alcohol, accidentally burning up a tent full of explosives, etc.) that remind more of an American Pie movie than Apocalypse, Now.     But that's okay, in a movie this slow, I'm guessing the producers and Mendes knew they'd need some cheap thrills. Personally, I'd rather have the film be shorter and less fluffy, but, when you cast Jake Gyllenhaal, you almost HAVE to bring the fluff. My personal favorite comedy bit, and maybe the only one that works in the entire film, happens when a helicopter flies over the Marines when they're at their lowest point. As the helicopter passes, blaring the Doors song \\"Break On Through,\\" Swofford looks at the sky and says \\"that's Vietnam music; can't we get our own music?\\"     After about 80 minutes the film starts to pick up. Our crew of Marines are in the 112 degree desert, chasing a group of fire-happy Iraqi soldiers. The way cinematographer RogerDeakins (known mostly for his work on The Shawshank Redemption and every great Coen Brothers film) shoots the desert footage is amazing. I don't want to give anything away, but will say that, between Skarsgaard's powerful performance and Deakins' cinematography, Jarhead is a must-see. Sometimes it feels like a painfully by-the-books war film and at other times it stands alone - thanks to Deakins' amazing eye and mastery of his craft. (Towards the end we get to see some incredible footage of a desert filled with burning oil wells. It's the kind of cinematic imagery film fans dreamt of before all this crazy CGI stuff became so standard. I recall being wide-eyed and out of breath through many of these scenes.)     Is there a big bang at the end? Does the suspense and conflict finally come as it does in, well, every war film ever? Well ... maybe. Kinda. I don't quite know how to explain it. I will say this: upon it's initial release, the ending made the average movie-goer angry and many cinephile types happy. It's uncompromising and subtle, which is strange when you consider how much, at times, it felt likes Mendes was trying to make an artsy war film for the popcorn crowd. Instead, he ends up with a film that is only a few cheap mistakes away from being a classic.     Jarhead is full of memorable lines, but is best summed up in the final minutes when Swofford says \\"every war is different; every war is the same.\\"

B004NEDI8A|2.0|Curiosity has always been my primary reason for discovering, watching, and analyzing unique things; including of course films.  I can only think of a few occasions where my curiosity drew me toward something I wish I didn't experience.  A Serbian Film is one of those films and probably along with [[ASIN:B0019X3ZZY Sal&ograve;]] the only actual work of fiction.  It troubled me.  Something about my mood just wasn't the same a day after watching it.  I've seen [[ASIN:B0032D5ESA August Underground's Mordum]], [[ASIN:B002R8EK5E Slaughtered Vomit Dolls]], [[ASIN:B00009W0U4 Irreversible]], [[ASIN:B000OPPAEM Sweet Movie]], [[ASIN:B0043CCPLS The Baby of Macon]], [[ASIN:B00007H24I the Guinea Pig films]], [[ASIN:B0000AQS1H Men Behind The Sun]], and many more.  Those are all hard movies to watch but this was different.  This put my mind at intense unease and put an uncomfortable feeling in my gut.  It could be akin to viewing such non-fiction atrocities like the Dagestan massacre video at the beginning of the Second Chechnyan War or the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs in the Ukraine who video-taped and photographed their killing spree in 2007 (one video of which made it to the internet).  That's how unsettling A Serbian Film was, but in the spirit of William Castle and Wes Craven, remember and repeat; it's only a movie, it's only a movie.<br /><br />A Serbian Film is also not necessarily out of the realm of possibility despite having scenes that are uncalled for and at times just laughably deranged or absurd.  I simply wish I could somehow erase A Serbian Film from my memory.  With those kinds of warnings I'm sure many hardcore gore fanatics are now curious while reading this, but I strongly caution that even you absolutely do not want to see A Serbian Film.<br /><br />Milos is a former porn star with a wife and a young boy.  His life has obstacles, most of which is probably his brother who seems to fancy Milos's wife, but it all changes when Milos is given a very high paying job offer for more pornographic work, with a catch that he is not to know what is going to happen as the film is made.  The film's director is extreme to say the least and Milos finds himself in a world of child pornography, necrophilia, rape, and even outright snuff films.  Needless to say the film's arc lends itself to some shocking images but even with that in mind the film goes far enough that we have to think is it being intentionally controversial and provocative.  It wants you to hear someone say its the most horrific film ever made but it is intelligent enough to not only get away with accusations of being gratuitous in some circles, but it is also intelligent enough to enhance its horror with great efficiency.  The story itself also plays on the urban legend of snuff films of course, and even though that has been done before, it is done far better here.  I've always wondered if there could be a market for sick films like that and this film's very existence and potential for success might make a case that there is.

B004132HZS|5.0|If you like BBC programs this is a good one.  It's a good modern adaptaion of Shelock Holmes.  The use of modern devices like cell phones, computer, text messages adds a nice touch to the show.  I highly recommend.  The only draw back is that it's only 3 episodes, it would be nice to have more.
0156030306|5.0|Years ago I had to read this in high school, and I've read it several times since--I'm now 40.  In addition to reading this book I've worked with developmentally disabled individuals such as Charlie, and it makes me always grateful for everything I have, mentally and physically.  I think what makes this book one of my favorites is that it shows how someone like Charlie is actually just like a lot of people--he wants to be happy, he wants to better himself, he wants others to like him, he wants to be good at what he does.  After all, when it comes down to it aren't we all alike more than we are different?      The hardest part of the book for me wasn't the end, but the point where he starts to become arrogant as a result of his acquired intelligence.  I'm not saying I prefer the retarded Charlie, but I know many highly intelligent people who have no social skills, are obnoxiously arrogant, and think they are better than others.  It's ironic that we live in a society which pushes excellence (no less than straight A's on a report card)--does this really equal happiness?  We are always searching for more, more, more.  Perhaps it's just better to BE.      For those of you who are reading some of the lower star ratings which are affecting your decision as to whether to read this book beware:  most of those readers are high school students who have been forced to read this book for a class.  Don't let it sway your decision to read this great book.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Inside Man features an incredible cast, a great - but not perfect - crime thriller script, amazing cinematography and a World Class director named Spike Lee. On paper it's a great film. If you see clips of some of the should-be classic scenes, you'd think this was one for the ages. It's not. There are just too many problems. Problems, sadly, that could've easily been avoided.     That said, Inside Man is a pretty good film. Not the classic it should've been, but a solid film that appeals to both the cinephile set and the everyday popcorn movie goer. Lee, who didn't write the script and only casually adds his signature fingerprints, here comes off as a real moviemaker, Inside Man maybe being the movie we'll look back on as proof of his ability. Where fellow auteur types of his generation such as Wes Anderson and Quentin Tarantino seem unable to make anything other than signature films, Lee has done much for his legacy by proving that he can skillfully - and successfully - make someone else's movie.     And damn if Inside Man - which stars heavyweights Denzel Washington and Clive Owen (as well as a great supporting cast and the unnecessary presence of Jodie Foster) - isn't the by-far most commercially successful film of Lee's career, bringing in almost $200 million at theaters worldwide. To put that into perspective, Lee's films average $20 million. The concept of an auteur stepping away from his usual style to make a Hollywood picture, and then that film making 10 times more than the average of his other films, would be a great topic for a paper. Hell, it'd be a great idea for a topics course at a film school. I'd say that it's a shame, but, for what it is (an instantly entertaining bid dollar film whose only real creative touch is a small storytelling device), it's about as good as they come.     Now, how about those above mentioned problems. The usage of music, for starters, is embarrassingly unfitting and bad. Just plain bad taste. Also, Denzel's lead is a bit tooclichéd of a character. They made lots of good movies anchored by characters so obvious in 40s, 50s and 60s, but not much since. Needless to say, Denzel's Detective Keith Frazier is a snore despite the actor's every effort to bring him to life. Another major problem is the Jodie Foster character, who is just downright out of place and almost unnecessary. We know why she's there, and it makes sense, but I get the feeling that some of the scenes that would've held her storyline together were cut or written out. Her presence will likely leave you scratching your head. And last but not least we have that story telling device we mentioned above, which is best described as a \\"In Medias Res\\" style, with Owen's character teasing us from the first frame and interrogation scenes edited here and there. It's not a bad device ... it just doesn't work nearly as well as the writer, director, producers and cast probably thought it would when they were in production. Sometimes that happens in movies. Often, especially when you attempt something as ambitious as In Medias Res.     Inside Man does succeed, however, thanks to how well its made (especially the non linear editing, which is almost next-to-none), how nicely Lee injects style points here and there, and how downright memorable and well executed a handful of scenes are. But what, you ask, is the movie really about? Well, it's a heist movie. It's about some people robbing a bank and a very paranoid man who really doesn't want something he has stored in a safe deposit box to be uncovered. It's about a detective's last case before retiring and it's about a brilliant criminal. I don't want to say too much more, due to how the story is told and how easy it can be to kill the fun of a heist film by trying to describe the action. To me, Inside Man is about its director. It's about Spike Lee, who uses the film to remind us that he's one of the very best of his time.
B002Q9MZF6|5.0|This is an Opera made into a film not, as is more usual, a film of the Opera. This treatment allows the director to shoot with an intimacy that would be impossible in a filmed stage production. For me the difference is magical as it brings the characters to life and makes them more accessible and more human. Netrebko makes Mimi endearing, cute and lovable in Act I and II and that, in turn, made Act III and IV even more heart wrenching. Villazon is completely believable as Rodolfo and the chemistry is amazing between him and Netrebko. Cabel and Von Bergen make a great pairing as Musetta and Marcello (really great).    Some people have made an issue out of the fact that the actual film sound track is recorded in a studio rather than on set. They will probabaly compare the singing to other great singers and analyze it. In my opinion the singing is excellent in this film. Everyone has their favorite tenors and sopranos so while I adore Anna Netrebko I'm not going to compare her to anyone. What I will say is that my dad told me to listen to music with your heart not your head. With this film my heart has more to connect with because I do not have to imagine as much. I can see Mimi biting her lip when she knocks on Rodolfo's door and I can see her wince when he tries to touch her just before Donda lieta usci. I have yet to get through this film without feeling like I have been on an emotional roller coaster and judging by my daughter's reaction last night when she saw it she felt the same. We shared the kleenex. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. Forget about everything except what you see and hear and give yourself a treat you will never forget.
0545140323|5.0|This book was an amazing read! It was a light and fun book, I really noticed that I got attached to the characters and felt all of their emotions. It has a very original plot line and that added to the uniqueness of the book. I recommend this book to everyone.
0452287022|4.0|Most of us know the painting, if not by name, but by sight at least. You might have even watched the movie starring Colin Firth (!!) and Scarlett Johanssen. Many of us might have heard of Johannes Vermeer, the artist behind this painting. But have you ever wondered, who is the girl in the painting? What is her story? What lies behind that indecipherable expression?<br /><br />Ever since I read The Birth of Venus by Sarah Dunant, I have loved books which involve art and artists. I don't claim to have much knowledge about art, but as a layperson I can say that the book, Girl With a Pearl Earring is evocative and mesmerizing.<br /><br />Johannes, Jan or Johan Vermeer (1632-1675) was a Dutch painter who specialized in exquisite, domestic interior scenes of middle class life.The painting Girl with a Pearl Earring is one of Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer's masterworks and as the name implies, uses a pearl earring for a focal point. Today the painting is kept in the Mauritshuis gallery in the Hague. It is sometimes referred to as \\"the Mona Lisa of the North\\" or \\"the Dutch Mona Lisa\\". (Source: Wikipedia)<br /><br />Girl with a Pearl Earing by Tracy Chevalier is the story of Griet, a young girl who is sent to work at Vermeer's house as a maid. Her father is no longer able to support the family, following an accident that leaves him blind. As a result, Griet is uprooted from all that she has known to a completely unfamiliar environment.<br /><br />Griet is in charge of cleaning Vermeer's studio, a place where hardly anyone, not even his wife Catharina, is allowed to enter. For Griet, the studio is like a mysterious and enchanted land. Even before she has met him, she is drawn to Vermeer and his paintings. Soon, Vermeer is enamored by this quiet and scared young girl. Thus, starts the journey towards Vermeer's most celebrated painting.<br /><br />Girl with a Pearl Earring is a fascinating portrayal of the mystery behind the painting. Somehow, reading this book, makes the painting more magical and beautiful in my eyes. Perhaps, the actual story will forever remain unknown but Tracy Chevalier's take is enough to satisfy one's curiosity about the painting.<br /><br />I felt for Griet right from the start. Griet, in her innocence, unknowingly causes conflict within Vermeer's family as the artist's obsession with her grows. At the same time, she's as captivated by him, as he by her.<br /><br />\\"He saw things in a way that others did not, so that a city I had lived in all my life seemed a different place, so that a woman became beautiful with the light on her face.\\"<br /><br />One of my only problems with the book is that the author fails to create a very vivid portrayal of 17th century Delft. However, there's so much eloquence and passion in the way the author describes Vermeer, his paintings and his relationship with Griet, that it's easy to overlook any flaws. The book's premise is what won me over and kept me engaged throughout.<br /><br />One of the best parts about the book are the diverse characters. There's the mysterious Vermeer, his jealous bitter wife, Catharina and his powerful, controlling mother-in-law, Maria. The author has depicted the power-play, class system, poverty, the terrible conditions of the poor, religious prejudices and women's position in 17th century Holland. It may seem like a simple story, but it has so many complexities.<br /><br />There's so much left unsaid between Griet and Vermeer that it breaks your heart. Till the end I kept on asking myself - What is it between the two of them? It did not seem like love to me, but more like an intense longing and desire. I think everyone will have their own take on this.<br /><br />The movie, I think, captures the beauty and sensuality of the book. It's not perfect, but it's much better than most book-to-movie adaptations. According to the author :<br />\\"I love the film. It is like and yet not like the book, rather in the way sisters resemble each other yet also have distinctive personalities.<br /><br />As you would expect of a film about Vermeer, it is ravishing to look at - each scene beautifully lit and composed, almost like a succession of would-be Vermeer paintings, with some Rembrandts and de Hoochs thrown in for fun. Colin Firth is excellent as Vermeer, managing to retain the painter's mystery even as we get to know him. But the film belongs to Scarlett Johannson, who is only 18 and has maybe 60 words of dialogue, yet packs so much into her luminous face that I couldn't take my eyes off her.\\"<br />(Source: Tracy Chevalier's Website)<br /><br />Overall:<br />An entrancing take on the story of the girl in Vermeer's most famous painting<br /><br />Recommended:<br />Yes!

B004NFB4EO|1.0|When Lady Gaga first unleashed her crazy self all over pop culture I swore her off as a `one hit wonder' that would never amount to anything.  `Just Dance' was a decent enough techno/pop/club track that got your head moving but it had no substance and, in my eyes, no staying power.  With each and every vanity laced track that slipped through the cracks of the Gaga factory, I kept thinking it would be her swan song until it became apparent that Gaga was going nowhere.<br /><br />Instead, she was sinking her claws deep into the root of American Pop Culture for a long time to come.<br /><br />If you've read my reviews of her albums, you would know that I actually like this chick.  She is ridiculous, but in a fun and exciting way, and her stamp on relevance is undeniable.<br /><br />She's a hot mess, but I respect her all the more for it.<br /><br />With that comes this train wreck of a song that I just don't understand the hype or that adoration of.  In a world where even Madonna doesn't want to be Madonna, why in the world would Lady Gaga want to be Madonna?  In my mind's eye, Gaga just tossed her relevance out the window with the release of `Born This Way'.  This track is going to be hot for debate for some time to come, so don't pounce all over this review as a way of attack.  I still think that Gaga is ridiculously talented (say what you want about her showy nature, but her talent is undisputable) but I just feel like this was a wasted effort.  Some may claim it nostalgic or respect it as a semi-homage to the greats of before, but she does nothing to make this even remotely modern or accessible today.  It feels so dated it's embarrassing almost.  The controversial lyrics are also nowhere near extreme enough to validate the hype.  The disco/pop nature of this Madonna inspired Village People after party anthem doesn't do anything to really bolster awareness or make a distinct statement about her point of view.  Maybe it is created to illicit nothing more than pride in ones `self' but in the end this underwhelming rip-off feels like a waste of Gaga's talents.<br /><br />I hope that this was a fluke.end this underwhelming rip-off feels like a waste of Gaga's talents.

047158651X|5.0|Voet and Voet goes synonymous to advanced biochemistry. It is wonderful how he takes you through the course of the book. The detailed examples are simply perfect. He's talking about biological function of Z-DNA, he gives exact details about the conditions and conclusions that let the fact. You would very less likely ask, 'why is that' to the extent of interesting details he goes to.     It is the examples that I think make this book so wholesome.     However, as others have mentioned, the communication could be better. You always have to read twice before you perfectly get to what he says.     Also, it is intended to be a 'professor's' book. He gives so many details that although it all sounds like a fact and worth storing in memory, it isn't. It is hard to classify. Use this book, only if you are very much interested in the details of the subject. To my knowledge, a complete knowledge (as much as you can remember!) of the subject can take you straight to the field of your choice, which I am perfectly sure would not much difficulty learning since there'll not be a vastness that is not mentioned in Voet and Voet.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This album is great when you listen to it the first time, then it just gets better! I've been listening to it, on and off, for 3 months now and I can still enjoy it. It has pop it has punk and it has rock, all of this is laced with excellent drums and a soothing harp, and topped off with Florence's stunning vocals, creating a unique sound that I just love! Can't wait for her next album!
0756404738|3.0|Let me start by saying that the first book, NoTW, is one of my favorite all time books. It was soooo good. I read it multiply times. I waited years for its sequel to come out. Maybe my expectations were too high.     WMF was ok. It was not great. Parts of the book were too long and parts it seemed the author rushed though. The first 400 pages were good, but I felt that it should have been included in the first. It took forever for the main character to leave the school. Way too long for a transition.    I wish the author wasn't so locked in to making a trilogy. This book could have been three 500 pg books and done a much better job. It seems like he really wants to be like Sanderson and write super long books, but Sanderson can handle them and gets them out more quickly and tightly.     Also, it seems sometimes Patrick tries to throw in a joke when it's not needed. At times I thought, \\"Wow, he must really think he is very funny.\\"     Kvothe is one of the best characters ever, but I don't really see any growth in his character. So, I guess I expected much more since I waited three years for this book to come out.     So, check out this book because it;s worth reading and just hope the next one is better and closer to the quality of the first one.     I think this one has so many 5-star review because the first book was awesome and people feel a loyalty to the Pat.
0440241413|3.0|Initially I didn't want to read  Confessions of a Shopaholic, but as it was a gift and highly recommended from a friend of mine I felt obligated to read it. After sitting on my shelf for about a year, and by chance running into the movie on television it sparked my interest in finally reading it. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />At first Rebecca Bloomwood in theory would seem like the most annoying person in the world, but oddly enough she came across as a likable rascal and just ridiculously  outlandish. Sort of like a Lucille Ball kind of character, you can't help but like her. You see, Rebecca Bloomwood has a problem with shopping and in the realization that she must cut back, she ends up spending even more.<br /><br />What really stuck out to me was not her ability to spend so much money on useless things, but her ability to just up and lie about anything. It's a horrible trait for a character.<br /><br />Twenty-five year old Miss Bloomwood is a really flawed woman, but what I loved was that she was able to redeem herself and figure out that she is a strong person. She realizes she has people and issues she feels strongly about, and when given the chance to solve her problems easily, she turns it down knowing that it would be wrong to accept someone's money based on the lies she told them. She's flawed, but not evil.<br /><br />The romance was simple, and I would have liked to see more character development with Luke, but I suppose that will happen in the next book, Shopaholic Take Manhattan. Overall it was a fluffy book that still taught a financial message in a fun way. Don't let it sit on your shelf for a year like I did. Read it.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Why that title? Because OOP and GOF both left me too many questions about what was going on during the movie since I have not read the books. What I feel were important scenes (for us who have not read all the books) key to understanding the flow of the story were left out in those two movies ... especially in OOP, which left me totally confused.<br /><br />This, thank goodness, is not the case in HBP. The opening scenes in the film clearly establish its tie to the previous movie (Order of the Phoenex) and all sequences within the story follow upon one another ... although I am a little confused about how Snape's potion's book came to be in the cupboard at school and why it was deemed to be so much of a problem that Harry and Ginny decided to hide it away where no one, including Harry, could ever find it again. The book probably explains this a bit, but then, I haven't read the book.<br /><br />The acting, as always, is superb and enjoyable. The characterization of Horace Slughorn adds immeasurably to the story. He is complex and yet very simple and easy to understand. He is very human as well .. and has some interesting quirks about him.<br /><br />I was a little surprised to find out that Snape was the half-blood prince and do not understand the importance of the title or how he manages to have it. But this does not detract from the movie at all. Matter of fact, it's not mentioned until the last minutes of the film and was never really a question to be answered during the length of the flick.<br /><br />The ending of the movie is certainly a surprise (I won't ruin it here for those who may not have seen the film and haven't read anything on the Internet) and was a bit put out. However, in reading more on the up and coming two part movie, The Deathly Hallows, one finds out that the person they think is a rogue and traitor is not that at all. Anyway, it's a jaw-dropper.<br /><br />Technically, the DVD is as good as any made today. The picture and colors are clear and bright, the audio is free from noise or hiss and is immently understandable, and there are extras on the DVD for those that like some background to the story itself.<br /><br />All in all, a fine addition to the ongoing serial of Harry Potter. I shall be very disappointed to see the series end with the release of Deathly Hallows, Part II. But then, the adventures can't go on forever. Additionally, both the concept (by Ms Rowlings) and the films have given us a fine bit of film making and story telling that we may enjoy again and again throughout the years.<br /><br />Definately recommended for all ages.<br /><br />~P~or hiss and is immently understandable, and there are extras on the DVD for those that like some background to the story itself.

B001DHXT20|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Let me state unequivocally at the outset that in comparing Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" and Louis Leterrier's \\"Incredible Hulk\\" movies, I believe Ang Lee's version is superior. My reason for this can be summed up by a paraphrase of a quote from Roger Ebert's review of \\"1984\\": \\"(Leterrier's) version of (Marvel's tormented green character) turned (the Hulk's plight) into a cautionary, simplistic (superhero) tale. (Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\") penetrates much more deeply into (the character's psychological) heart of darkness.\\" If you are interested in a more detailed explanation of my reasoning, I refer you to my \\"Ph.D. thesis\\" review of Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" on IMDb.<br /><br />However, all that psychological complexity elicited a lot of discomfort and hostility from \\"Hulk\\" viewers. They didn't want to see a tragic, emotionally reserved character struggling with mental and father dilemmas and abuse as well as his gamma-irradiated condition. God damn it, they wanted an unambiguous superhero rising up to beat the bad guys to a pulp and save humanity, the world, or something. They wanted the most unconventional, unlikely \\"superhero\\" of all to follow the old movie superhero formula: 1) Origin of good guy superhero, 2) Origin of good guy superhero's nemesis, 3) Circumstances that bring the superhero and nemesis together to fight. Apparently, the corporate suits listened to this plea and gave the world \\"The Incredible Hulk\\".<br /><br />Consequently, Leterrier's \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" takes the character nuances and motivations Lee's \\"Hulk\\" worked so hard to cultivate and makes them slicker, simpler and more basic. The Hulk/Bruce Banner no longer is the reluctant or accidental hero who only wants to live a peaceful life and inherits his powers by accident. This time Banner (Edward Norton) is a rash, ambitious graduate student who deliberately subjects himself to gamma radiation almost as a lark, to see what superpowers he'll get and soon rues his choice. The Hulk's/Bruce's anger no longer arises from trauma suffered from years of parental abuse. This time, being chased around by the military because he is \\"U.S. government property\\" as General Thaddeus \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross (William Hurt) puts it, and has a power Ross and many others want to scientifically duplicate, makes Banner lose it and \\"Hulk out\\". General Ross himself is no longer an ambivalent character, a dutiful soldier bent on crushing the menacing Hulk but also obsessively protective of his only child, Betty Ross. Instead, he is a purely unscrupulous, selfish villain. However, the Hulk himself does manage to keep most of his pathos and sympathy in spite of Leterrier's efforts to steer him into superhero status.<br /><br />Leterrier glosses over the Hulk's creation in a frantic montage, instead of Lee's deliberate, contemplative origin story. Conversely, however, he takes more time following the creation of the Hulk's ultimate nemesis, another gamma creature known as the Abomination (not named in the film). The Abomination is actually Emil Blonsky, a Slavic (?) mercenary Ross retains to help his troops capture the Hulk. Blonsky, a veteran soldier past his prime, is apparently an adrenaline and power junkie. Impressed by his first encounter with the Hulk in South America, and gradually learning from the reticent Ross about his origin, Blonsky is insanely eager to become a match for the Hulk.<br /><br />Meanwhile, chased from his hideout in the Rio favela slums by Ross's troops but escaping to Culver University in Virginia (I think) partly by transforming into the Hulk, Banner reunites with Betty Ross and conspires with her to go to New York and meet with Dr. Samuel Sterns, to whom he has shipped blood samples in hopes of finding a cure. Unfortunately, Banner learns to his shock that the animated Dr. Sterns too has jumped on the \\"Super Soldier\\" bandwagon and has cloned his blood proteins to discover their amazing properties. Before Dr. Stearns can proceed with his research, Ross, Blonsky, and the military arrive. Having received an initial dose of the \\"Super Soldier formula\\" from Ross and already lost to the Hulk in an initial confrontation, Blonsky comes back for Round 2. Blonsky forces Dr. Stearns to give him a booster shot of Banner's proteins, which completely transform him into the Abomination. He goes on a rampage.<br /><br />To save New York, Banner skydives from a military helicopter without a parachute to compel himself to transform into the Hulk. He does so just in time before hitting the pavement. He collides with the Abomination in the night-time New York streets and the two behemoths have a battle royal which culminates on a building roof. After about a half-hour of punishing blows, the Hulk eventually triumphs and jumps away. Humanity is saved (and the Hulk has caused minimal collateral damage).<br /><br />Despite the \\"dumbing-down\\" of this iconic \\"monster\\", I still enjoyed \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" as a well-paced, exciting action flick that makes some improvements on Ang Lee's version. Much as I like Eric Bana in Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\", he's really too tall and muscular to play Bruce Banner. Edward Norton's slighter build is more suitable to the role. Norton's Banner also projects more vulnerability and desperation. Liv Tyler's performance as Betty Ross reinforces Banner's humanity even as the Hulk even more than Jennifer Connelly's version in \\"Hulk\\". Tim Roth's manic, driven Blonsky/Abomination promises to give the Hulk more headaches in sequels. And we get to see the Hulk act truly heroic, with hints that he will do so again in the future, if Banner has anything to say about it.military arrive.

B0034G4ORC|4.0|I caught \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" this past weekend (wife opted out). It turned out to be an agreeable, watchable alien invasion movie. To tell the truth, though, the battle action and war spectacle were pretty generic and didn't have much to do with the fact that the invaders were aliens from another world.<br /><br />For the most part, with the exception of an occasional glance at an alien soldier or one of their flying drone ships, the invaders could just as well have been the Red Chinese. In short, during the course of the movie, the emphasis was pretty much on how cool and brave the U.S. Marines were. Which was fine. Just don't go looking for a long, detailed look at an imagined alien culture, and you might not be disappointed.<br /><br />Further, a movie like this definitely goes to show you the value of a good actor. Aaron Eckhart (he was Harvey Dent, a.k.a. Two-Face in \\"The Dark Knight\\") plays a battle-scarred sergeant who helps a group of Marines undertake a rescue mission. Eckhart's portrayal- earthy, tough, heartfelt- makes you forget you're watching a big special effects movie and gets you to genuinely care about his and his soldiers' fates.
076115678X|5.0|Excellent book.  I've been trying to cope with my curly hair for ALL of my life.  I fought it through most of my childhood, either hiding it or straightening it with every tool or product that I could find.  It wasn't until I was newly married that I finally decided to just let it be.  Over the years I was able to figure out a few things, but there were SO many more things that I had no idea were working against me!  I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who has wavy to curly hair!
1595141715|5.0|this story follows a young girl days before,knowing she was going to kill herself.  you read the book as the main character listens to the tapes, you get exactly what he is feeling in this duel- narration. you start to hear her story and just cant wait sitting on the edge of your chair wanting to read more and more to find out the reasons that this has happened. especially why does the guy that seemed to care the most have to do with it all.    Its a great tale that will forever remain one of my favorite books.

At first I was a little put off by how slowly it went and then a little more by how it seemed a bit twilight esque but then I remembered what I loved about twilight before Hollywood destroyed it. in essence it was the perfect love story and Stephanie meyer was brilliant at Evoking Emotions so to is Deborah E. Harkness! and I love this book!! I Want moree!!!
B004DMNT2W|4.0|Good: Nicely padded. Cute inside pocket for memory cards. Convertible strap for multiple carrying options. Compact. Good quality construction.<br /><br />Not so good: Small; your video camera may not fit. May take some practice to insert camera, as the case opens in the middle, with an elastic strap to secure the camera - the opening is a bit snug, and you have to maneuver the camera under the strap.<br /><br />The cons seem more than the pros, but that's because it took more text to explain them. However, the size is a consideration; seems to be made for the more recent, smaller cameras. No room for other stuff, but that's the point of the design - easy access to the camera itself. I'm basing the ratings on the assumption that your camera fits.

0393338959|4.0|I decided to read Freefall (by Joseph Stiglitz) after seeing a talk by the author. In the book Stiglitz promises to peel back the layers of causes responsible for the recent financial market collapse. When asked why the collapse happened most people will respond by saying banks were giving out mortgages to people who could not pay back. But Why? Because the incentives of the mortgage originators and bankers were flawed. But then the question is why did the market not respond to those flawed incentives and encourage firms that had the right incentive structure. Stiglitz frames the economic collapse in context of larger debate between Keynesian's and Monetarist's. His central claim is that since late 1970s Monetarist thought has been gaining the upper hand and the current crisis is the result.    The book starts off very crisply. Stiglitz invites you to listen to the story of the crisis and keeps you engaged even while going over parts of the story that you have already heard. He gives a comprehensive account of the crisis and I learned many things even though I considered my self well aware of the events. He castigates the political administrations starting from Regan's for dismantling the regulatory system which was ultimately responsible for the crisis.    While he is extremely critical of the bankers, regulators and politicians he seems to give the homeowners who took mortgages they could not afford a free pass. He never quite gets around to explaining how the american family who took the zero percent down, non recourse mortgage was the victim when they could just walk away from the home that they had no business owning in the first place. He seems to see no difference between the hardworking Americans who save for a down-payment and only buy homes they can afford and those who get the biggest house they can with nary a thought to finances.    He also latches on to ARM's as unequivocally bad and predatory which is not really true. He mentions them multiple timesand faults Greenspan for encouraging them in a lecture. In an otherwise crisp and insightful narrative I felt a dissonance reading the simple minded rhetoric on ARM's. In an ARM the borrower takes on the interest rate risk and in return gets a lower cost for the loan. These mortgages are pretty common in many countries (like Canada) and they work as well as the fixed rate mortgages used to in America.    The above faults aside Stiglitz is spot on in his criticisms on how the stimulus has played out. Banks and their shareholders got too sweet a deal. He explains how all the reasons given on why banks and their shareholders are entitled the the tax payer largess are flawed. The Obama administration policies have failed to stop a crisis like this from recurring. The banks are still too big to fail, and thus enjoy the implicit government guarantees.    The only problem with the book is its length. After about half way through, I started feeling that the arguments and examples got repetitive. It felt like someone who has been ignored for years has finally been vindicated and now cannot stop saying \\"I told you so\\".    Overall, I would highly recommend the book to anyone who is interested in the financial crisis. It pairs really well with The Big Shot
B0068MNNOE|5.0|Both Vanessa Redgrave and Joely Richardson deliver meticulous performances in one of the most intriguing films of the 21st century (thus far), that presents that Oxfordian, centuries old, position about who authored the 37 plays attributed to William Shakespeare. The facts I learned about the period, such as that there was so much mud around the Globe theater that boards were walked upon since there were no concrete sidewalks, give this film the feel of one that has been extraordinarily well researched to the finest details. I like that. A lot.<br /><br />Movies that wreak of stupidity drive me nuts. Thus, this mastery of intrigue of a motion picture, done with extremely precise costuming for the period, sets to create that feeling on actually being in the period, and even the accents used, most especially by Vanessa Redgrave, who is so brilliant a character actor, doing period pieces and historical dramas, who can also make the most serious of moments fill up with such human emotion that audiences feel more than one emotion at a time. I mean, I know the scene is serious but somehow Vanessa Redgrave injects it with an aire of lightness of being that is nearly funny. At the very least, amusing. The heaviness of the topic of who authored the plays attributed to Shakespeare is de-centered by Redgrave's talent for taking me along her journey through becoming a character. Bette Davis is the only other actor who could do that for me. Thus, while other actors had more intense or lengthy roles in this film, for me, the elder Redgrave steals the show~
B0042816YK|3.0|I loved  the book but the movie was a disappointment. If I would have seen the movie first I would not have read the book. I am a Julia Roberts fan but she wasn't the right lead for the movie maybe because she was a distraction and I couldn't not see \\"Julia Roberts\\"
1400052173|5.0|I was reading this book at one point of my life where I had to decide my college major. I'll say that after reading this book, I've developed a keen interest in biology especially in the research of cancer cells and stem cells. I loved this book so much that it has changed my life- and that is how good it was. I loved the description, the researches and the efforts put into producing this book. The hard work put in by the author, Rebecca is so obvious and I feel and keen sense of admiration to her diligence and patience. She deserves a standing ovation. This book also provides an insight into the black community in the 50s, generally, and how they were oppressed and such. The description of the situation makes you feel like you're inside the situation. All in all, I also sympathizes the horrible experiences that the Lackses have been through when they were younger, especially for Zakkariya. I am empathetic towards him, and glad that he has finally found his place somewhere- in a religion that I respect. However, I just think that certain contents of the book might be a tad bit scientific that some people might not dig into. Not me of course- just for certain people that I know that are not that keen in the subject of cells and biology, generally.

0030565812|4.0|Just finished reading this excellent book. In Indian minds African anti-apartheid struggle has a special place, because it was in South Africa that Mahatma Gandhi first experienced the injustice of colonialism and took his first steps towards fighting against it. As an Indian, we were always taught that this was an important incident in both South African and Indian history. From reading this book, apparently not so for South Africa. It may have been a transformational moment for Mahatma Gandhi, but not for African National Conference. In fact, at least Mr. Mandela was slightly anti-Indian in his early attitudes, fearing that they would usurp the blacks in the African freedom struggle.    Something else that I liked about the book was the detailed descriptions of how the non-white Africans were repressed in day to day lives. The book gives great insight into how an organization like ANC works, the nitti-gritty of the day to day management and organization of protests and rallies. This was a contrast from the Indian independence books and histories. Looking back, I do not really know exactly how the British repressed Indians. We all know of the few big highlights, like Jalllianwala Bagh massacre, but not so much about day to day lives of Indians under British rule. Also missing is the organizational details of Congress. We all know how Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement, but we have no idea, how the message was conveyed to all the people all over India about the movement in absence of 24 hour news channels.    Long Walk To Freedom is rich in all these details, the shocking and unbelievable attitude of Afrikaners (the white ruling class of South Africa) towards blacks and repression, till so late in 20th century when it seemed all the rest of the world had left these things so far behind. Given all this, its even more amazing that Mr. Mandela espoused reconciliation with the former oppressors, and was even successful at it.    The book is also very personal, andtraces the personal growth of Mr Mandela from a fiery youth who cared more about who got credit for a campaign rather than the results, to the great selfless statesman that the world knows now. From the person who started the military arm of ANC and was its first commander in chief, to the noble peace prize winning first president on South Africa responsible for the only country in Africa to peacefully integrate former colonist into the new black dominated order.    Overall a very educational book.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|This is a great series finale and it spans the 15 year gap from TS1 nicely. Enough reviewers have detailed the movie. I will just say my nieces and I (ages 11, 22 & 48) were mesmerized from start to finish. If you stepped up to Blu-Ray, this should be in your library. The colors popped and the resolution was sharp as expected. Plenty of extras including a digital copy for my Zune, and I was very happy with the value. Nicely done Pixar and please don't even think about TS4 unless it's a prequel. 8^)
1433523930|5.0|Am enjoying the added notes of the study Bible that tell more about the meanings of words and situations as they arise in the Bible.  Our minister encourages us to enjoy this help in our private and Church classroom studies.
1400032717|5.0|This is the best book that I have read so far- and I have been reading a lot of books. Its a relatively short read, and I finished it in a couple of hours from the front to the back. I like it that it helps me understand special needs children much more- that was the most intriguing part of the book. Mark's description of the boy, Christopher in the book was so flawless, that for the most part of the book I got lost in thinking that I was reading a true-life story written by an autistic boy. It also provides a lot of insight about the problems that parents face when raising a autistic kid, and the amount of understanding, knowledge and patience that they have to practice. This book also provides a lot of comfort to a lot of people, especially teenagers feels that they are relatively different from the rest of the crowd. Basically, the message is just that there are many different people in the world, but they all belong somewhere. A must read book that would probably just take an afternoon to finish. But just a warning though, you probably won't put it down once you get down to it.

068983571X|4.0|Despite being written in 1902, this is immensely fresh and readable mystery. Sherlock Holmes and his offsider Dr Watson are investigating the mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville. It appears that he may have fallen victim to a family curse: a ghostly hound that lurks in the nearby moor at night. Holmes and Dr Watson need to solve the mystery and in doing so protect Sir Charles's heir, Sir Henry Baskerville.<br /><br />The book has a terrific gothic atmosphere. There is the dark and near empty Baskerville Hall, eerie lights and sounds coming from the moor, anonymous letters of warning to Sir Henry, an escaped murderer on the loose, secretive locals and a general feeling of menace. The mystery has a number of strands with plenty of twists and red herrings along the way. Great fun.<br /><br />I recommend the Aladdin classics version of this book.  It includes an introduction and a reading group guide, and the font is a very nice size.

1439177783|5.0|I received the book a few days ago and read it within two nights. Very well written! I was dragged right into the scenery and could easily imagine how the building must have looked like, where Ally McBeal had been produced. What I liked most was the complexity of all layers that actually led to Portia's anorexia: her profession, sexuality, family and after all...society itself. Her struggle with coming out to the public was very clear - and I guess that's one main aspect why this book matters a lot to me. To know that somebody as good-looking and famous as Portia has to deal with the same stuff a lot of people are going through.  I recommend this book not only to gay or anorexic people. It should also be the \\"mainstream\\" reading this book, in order to understand how ignorance and narrow mindedness affects individuals and can shake them merely to the bone. Congrats Portia from Europe, for being so brave to put your painful story into words!
0375703861|5.0|This book, assigned to me in a 20th century history class, single-handedly opened my eye to fiction for the first time since middle school. The only work of fiction between Steinbeck's 'Pearl' which I read in 8th grade and Smith's 'White Teeth' I read as a college senior that really stuck with me was Camus' 'Stranger'. (Wide ranging taste, I'm aware.) Strongly rooted in its time(s), it also imaginative and Smith weaves together her characters and plot threads masterfully. It's a bit like a really good Seinfeld episode, only all the light themes are dark themes taken lightly. I mean that in a good way, of course. I know Smith's sense of humor can be lost on some, but it can be laugh-out-loud funny. Smith not only has a terrific handle on her characters, she has a great sympathy for them, which is a trait (I have found) most great novelists have.
0061726826|5.0|I could NOT put this book down. It was the only book since The Hunger Games trilogy that saw my heart racing, had me staying up late, and begging for more.    Lena is amazing. Although at first I was all, \\"really Lena?\\" she really amazed me with her wit, courage etc. Favorite YA protagonist ever? Quite possibly.    I love Alex almost as much as I love Peeta Mellark. And little Gracie? How can I child with so few (two?) words capture my heart so?    The writing is beautiful. I absolutely adored this book.    Sorry for so many Hunger Games comparisons. They're really not similar at all except for the whole Dystopian thing, but I was just so happy to FINALLY find a book that I enjoy as much :) I cannot wait for the sequel.
0764137433|4.0|This book has come in handy, especially for the reflexive verbs. Yes I know that you should be able to conjugate regular verbs on your own, but guess what, sometimes I need to double check whether I've spelled the word correctly. It's especially useful for the reflexive verbs, which I usually forget how to conjugate. I would've liked to see more example sentences and accents. I know accents are not used in \\"real life\\", but as a beginner, I need to know where to stress the accent.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I absolutely love the Mortal Instruments series and cannot wait til Fallen Angels comes out in April!  From the very first book you get pulled into the world of Shadowhunters & Downworlers and you are immediately connected to all the main characters.  I personally thought City of Glass has been the best of the series so far, as many things come to a head and you get a since of closure on some things.  When Clary and Jace found out they were brother and sister in City of Bones I was very hesistant to continue reading the rest of the series, I was so bummed out.  But I figured well I've already gotten this far might as well see what happens...it was def. worth the continued reading.    I really enjoy the authors way of writing, it keeps me intrigued and I really feel like I know the characters and it creates an investment in them and what happens to them.
0060825456|5.0|\\"CORALINE\\", by NEIL GAIMON, is basically out in three different formats.  This GRAPHIC NOVEL version, a novelized, (non-graphic) version -- and the movie version.  The regular, novel, book version is definitely great for those whose attention spans are still intact, (unlike mine, which has been blasted to smithereens by a life-time of watching TV -- with commercials ruining my concentration every 10 -15 minutes! A sense of concentration I am TRYING to recover!) That leaves the movie version and the graphic novel version for most people over 21.....    This is a story about a young girl who discovers an alternate universe in the strange old house she and her parents share with tenants in two other apartments.  These tenants are strange enough -- but the \\"Other Mother\\" and \\"Other Father\\" that Coraline discovers are distinctly far more weird --and far more frightening --than the dwellers in the other two apartments in the normal, (real?) world.  The \\"Other Mother\\", and \\"Other Father\\", LOOK (more or less) like Coraline's real-world mother and father -- but they have buttons for eyes, and -- especially in the \\"Other Mother's\\" case, are definitely up to NO GOOD.    The movie version of this novel, sadly, is NOT populated by any live actors.  IT IS ACTED ENTIRELY BY STOP MOTION-PUPPETS!  While stop-motion puppet movies are amongst my favourites, (LOVED \\"Chicken Run\\"!), the heart of the story of \\"Coraline\\" is that a normal, real-world girl finds herself face-to-face with evil, \\"other-world\\" characters that look ALMOST like  their real-world counterparts -- but not exactly enough.  IN THE MOVIE, CORALINE, TOO, IS A STOP-MOTION PUPPET!  The contrast between her, and her \\"Other\\" parents is thus totally lost -- and so is much of the impact of the movie!    In this geaphic novel, however, very (VERY!) realistic drawings, (by artist P. CRAIG RUSSELL),  show up the difference between real, and \\"Other\\" people.  These differences are very subtle in the beginning....but are greater and greater as the story continues.  By making Coraline look human, and the \\"Others\\" increasingly less so, the story gains impact and thrills.  The movie -- where ALL the stop-motion puppet characters look far less than human, totally loses impact here.    CORALINE is a mesmerizing story of one girl's horrific and scary adventure, and her fight to get back to the real world and her real parents.  In the end, she actually rescues them.  That kids CAN make a difference is one of the lessons in this by-now clasic book.  And the reality-vs-unreality of the situations Coraline finds herself in is far more accurately done in this graphic novel, than in the movie version, which reduces ALL characters to stop-motion puppets!    THIS is the version to buy!
B001AQO3Z6|5.0|This movie change my mind, my life and my point of view on so many things. Please, please, please... this movie deserved an absolut billiant presentation. Its a masterpiece of a movie. The holy Ghost came into Godfrey Reggio, Ron Fricke and Philipp Glass while making this movie. And now... through these beautiful and mindblowing pictures speaks the Almighty himself! So lets take care, that these holy pictures are coming into the best quality we can get!!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|I'm one of those people who is all for parodies, especially one making fun of Ghostface, and I know what you did last Summer. I bought this movie for my birthday sleepover so all of my friends could watch it, and I could keep it for myself. It was a big hit! Some of the scenes may be EXTREMELY crude, but it isn't going overboard too much, so it was insanely funny to watch. So, if you love to watch parodies, I would definatly recommend this movie! But if you want something more along the lines of a Parody about horror characters like Freddy, Jason, Michael, pinhead, and others, watch the movie Stan Hellsing. It is by the same director, so if you like this movie, you'll definately love Stan Hellsing too!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I have to say after the City of Bones ending I was reluctant to continue on with the series, but I'm very happy I did.  I went into this book thinking it wouldn't keep me as interested but I was wrong, I was glued to the book day and night.  I think I finished reading it in under a week....which is a feat for someone with a small toddler in the house.  The author really has a way of pulling you more and more into the stories of all the characters and the Shadowhunting world.
1400052181|4.0|The book as a very fascinating true story based on the life, death and immortality of Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta Lacks was an African American woman that died at the age of 31 of cervical cancer in 1951. Some cancer samples were taken from her without her knowledge or consent and they become the first successful human cell line culture which is present in all major pharmaceutical and medical research labs all around the world. These cells were used to find a cure for polio and are used in cancer and AIDS research as well as in and many other scientific work.<br />The story is well written and well researched and the author adds a nice human touch to the narrative. The only weakness in the book I find is that the author spends an inordinate amount of pages describing her own research for the book and her personal relationship with the Lacks family, which in my opinion, does not really adds anything significant for the book.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|I have viewed this film three times already, and each time my blood boils hotter and hotter. I am not a banker, lawyer or politician but this movie proves they are nothing more than sewer scum. They have attacked our nation and should be arrested, tried for treason and hung! We can no longer sit by and complain, we must react.     First we all need to register as independents. This will make the two parties that are ruining our country unsure how \\"We The People will vote\\"..... If that's not rigged also.    Second, we must demand immediate action with all involved  tried, convicted and locked away forever. Yes we are talking about you Ben Shalom Bernanke , Hank Paulson, Timothy Franz Geithner. We must do this for our children or they will someday be modern day slaves. Please watch this movie and invite everyone you know over to watch it.   Obama are you reading this? I want my money and life back!!!!!    Oh and don't buy Hank Paulson's book. He screwed our economy then he dares to write a book on it, are you kidding me? How f-ing dumb do you think we are?
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I originally started this because I was done with the Twilight books and was looking for something else to get involved with, I got a post on this book saying you could read this book online for free through a specific date so I figured why not.  I ended up really enjoying this book and more the whole series, so when the time frame was up I bought the book immediately.  I love Jace and Clary and Simon and all that it entails.  I was a bit disappointed with the ending in this book and it almost kept me from continuing with the series but I was glad to have kept reading.  I enjoy this author and the way she writes and it keeps me coming back for more.  I've recommended this series to a number of my friends and all of them have gotten hooked on it.
0451228375|5.0|I can understant why some didn't like this novel but I loved the adventures of Merthin , Caris , Ralph and Gwenda . I loved following the impossible love of Merthin and Caris , I read it fast (less than 10 days) it was hard to put it down ! I cried -tears of joys and tears of grief , and tears of revolt . I really appreciated that Ken Follett talked about the lives of serfs during the Middle-Age , how their lives were difficult and that nobles could do whatever they liked . I appreciated how he described the life during the one hundred war , because it was 116 years of wars but 116 years of uncertainties , diseases , famines , poverty .  Being French it was difficult to read the chapter about the battle of Crécy , even after more than 700 years ! But in my head I kept telling myself that in the end we won -I still wonder how we won ! And I admit that I felt a little resentment towards the English ;)  Ken Follett speak about the situation in England , in a city , I can't barely imagine how it was in my country when 95 % of the events took place here ...   Above all I loved that Mr Follett talked about the feminine condition , I was revolted how women were treated like beings who have no common sense , who doesn't know nothing , how easy it was to accuse a woman of witchcraft , how simply because a man is a man he can have better jobs and a better life situation over a women simply because she is a woman . Follett revolted me several times and I thought deeply about all these women through all these centuries -and again now- badly treated simply because they are women . I see this novel like an ode to women , strong women who never give up . Yes the sexual scenes were really 'graphic' but it is Ken Follet , I do not like prude novelist and he is not , good point for me . And I liked that most point of view during them were from women .  I have a certain fondess for Gwenda , her life has been hard and difficult but she proved that she was a strong woman despite her little stature . Caris , I thougth very , very often , that I totally comprehended her ...  Thank you Mr Follett for this marvelous novel !

B003Q6D2B4|2.0|Red has an all-star cast that includes Bruce Willis, Hellen Mirren, and Morgan Freeman, and was well received, so I expected better than what I got. What I got was just an average film with not enough action or comedy, and I thought this was supposed to be an action-comedy.
1400064287|5.0|Move over duct tape, the stickiness factor of this book is off the charts. Or, maybe that should be securely stuck to the charts.<br /><br />What makes Chip and Dan Heath's book so irresistibly sticky? The same factors behind the other winning ideas they deconstruct in their book: it beautifully conveys its message with  Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional Stories. [Note: their use of this SUCCESS acronym results in the long-lasting stickiness of the core content of the book.]<br /><br />The book is so hard to put down--it's as if it's literally sticking to your fingers! The brother-author team offers a cohesive combination of brilliance, creativity, humor, and clarity all rolled into one. Their incredible writing talents serve as the glue that allows the engaging, entertaining, and eye-opening content to stick to each page.<br /><br />The fun-factor of the book is pretty sticky too. From the getgo, the intriguing teasers in the table of contents for each chapter spark attention (while utilizing the \\"gap theory of curiosity\\" &lt;see Chapter 2>). For example, how could you not want to read more after being intrigued by this shorthand table of contents for Chapter 3?:<br />\\"Sour grapes. Landscapes as celebrities. Teaching subtraction with less abstraction. Soap-opera accounting. Velcro theory of memory. Brown eyes, blue eyes. Engineers vs. manufacturers. The Ferraris go to Disney World. White things. The leather computer. Clinic: Oral rehydration therapy. Hamburger Helper and Saddleback Sam.\\"<br /><br />Not only is reading the stories behind these teasers fun, but the ideas stick long after each chapter is read. It's fun to go back and re-read these teasers and be able to easily recall (and smile at) their corresponding stories. The true stickiness test passes when the content behind these teasers is just as memorable three weeks after reading the book as it was three minutes after. What better proof for stickiness do you need?<br /><br />_Made to Stick_ is stickier than a roll of duct tape....and way more fun to unravel.d way more fun to unravel.
1595141715|5.0|This book is by far the most amazing book I've read in years. I don't even have the words to express it. The way Jay Asher wirtes, I felt like I was right there experiencing the same thing. I don't want to say to much and spoil it, so all I can say is read it.

B002ZG976U|5.0|I loved this movie and so did my daughters...so much that we have watched it a couple of more times.  Is this movie based Mother Teresa, world hunger or the great writings of Keats?  Ummmm...no, but who cares.  Whatever ever happened to just simple entertainment...the story line is predictable, but again who cares.  I do not know about the rest of you, but if I want serious and depressing now-a-days you seem to only have to walk out the front door...I do not need every movie I watch to reflect the same thank you.  The costumes, the music, the visuals were all amazing and it kept me coming back for more.  So a bit of advice to those of you who seem to be \\"Part-time\\" critics...have a coke and a smile!  Thank god I didn't have to do any huge amount of thinking, simply sit back and be entertained!  I give this two thumbs up!
0307702103|5.0|I listened to this book on audio CD and loved the story telling by John Grisham as the narrator.  The stories were all captivating, well written and very enjoyable to listen to.
1439102724|4.0|I completely recommend this book. I'm definitely going to re-read it. However, the end was left a bit too wide open, and you want to know what happens with a few of the characters. The music is a very nice touch.
0756404738|5.0|The Wise Man's fear picks up directly after Name of the Wind covering Kvothe's life at college and his journey to becoming warrior, not just a scholar. Kovthe matures greatly in this portion of his life experiencing other cultures and the limits of his own knowledge. Rothfuss build upon the relationships of the first book letting you truly know the characters. This is probably the best sequel you'll ever read, making you pull all nighters just to finish it. Because the book begins directly from the end of the first one, I suggest re-reading the first book or visiting the author's page where he posted a summary of Name of the Wind.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Lovely movie full of wonderful actors, including Albert Finney and Michael Gambon.  Don't know why it is not better known.  Without being at all tiresome it tells the story of the years-long struggle of William Wilberforce (1759-1833)to abolish the slave trade in England and all of its colonies.  Along the way it explains how the lovely hymn, Amazing Grace, came to be written.  Wilberforce is wonderfully played by Ioan Gruffudd who manages the trick of portraying a stunningly good and moral man with huge passion and sex appeal.
B004E547D8|2.0|i saw the movie red at the cinema and thoroughly enjoyed it, as i saw it on amazon out earlier than australia and a lot cheaper as well. The only blue ray player i have is my ps3 but i thought it would still be ok! alas i was wrong it is region locked and will not play at all, in future might have to stick to just dvd format.
0060899220|5.0|I was blown away by Anthony's honesty, but also how descriptive and knowledgeable the book is. The chapter on what not to order at a restaurant is worth the price of the book alone. But its the doomed restaurant stories that really had me laughing and unable to put the book down. I read it in three days, which is remarkable considering this is the heart of hockey season and games cannot be missed. You will ignore family, friends and pets and become agoraphobic until the very last page. I remember snapping angrily at my spouse, \\"I'm at the end of the book!\\" when he tried to talk to me.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|This movie \\"Christine\\" is very well done much like the movie \\"The Car' But this car Christine has this boy under her spell he decides to buy her and fix her up and Christine whenever anyone gets in her and the boys way of anything she gets revenge on anyone who tries to hurt her or her owner and this movie is done in pretty much the same style as the movie \\"The Car\\" but this car has an owner and it is also driven by the Devil himself and the boy does not realize it until it is to late that the Car Christine is killing people who get in the way of her and the owner of her. And at the End of the movie Christine is also destroyed and blown up by 2 of the boys friends after she kills her owner. so the boy and girl set out to destroy Christine. and suceed. Again, this movie is also very well done I highly recommend this movie also.

0780624157|3.0|Thanks to a friend of mine finally cleaning out his garage, I was given a bunch of old VHS tapes including this old WCW one from 1998.  This VHS only last around an hour & is just highlights of the main matches from this event over the years.  The first half of the VHS is the early years of the event as we seen highlights of the the Steiner Brothers vs. Nasty Boys in 1990 and Rick Rude's World Title match against Ric Flair in 1993.  The main superstar highlighted during the first half of the tape is WCW's \\"Franchise\\" in Sting as his matches were highlighted: Thunderdome Cage Match with Ric Flair vs. Terry Funk & Great Muta from 1989, vs. Sid in 1990, the Chamber Of Horrors match in 1991, and his \\"Spin The Wheel, Make The Deal\\" encounter with Jake Roberts in 1992.  The second half of the VHS is completely devoted to Hulk Hogan as all of his moments from the event are shown from his cage match vs. Flair in 1994, his Monster Truck & in-ring matches against Giant in 1995, as Hollywood Hogan vs. Randy Savage in 1996, and the cage match vs. Roddy Piper in 1997.<br /><br />Unlike the \\"Best Of Bash At The Beach\\" tape, very few of these matches have been released in full on DVD (to this date, only 4 out of the 10 matches on here) with some of them being so \\"low profile\\" that most people don't know that they were released in the first place (like the Thunderdome Cage Match) so unless you can find these matches elsewhere on the internet, this is a tape that isn't outdated & still has some value to it so it's definitely a tape I would get under these conditions.

B004DMNT2W|5.0|Compared to the -10 I reviewed, this case has multiple uses.  I had been looking for a good microphone case and this fits the bill.  Also with smaller 1080p digital cameras this would work well.  Inside there are pockets for memory sdhc cards as well as a strap across the middle to prevent items from falling out.  I can see this being used to store sennheiser microphones safely with ample padding or the smaller canon prosumer cameras.  Craftsmanship is definitely top notch with the stitching and zipper.  On the back there is a velcro closed loop to make it easy to attach to belts or camera bags.  I have the wide angle lens attachment on my digital 1080p camera and it would not fit in this case due to the oversize wide angle lens attched which I normally keep attached for 1080x1920 video.  Also there is no room for accessories if you get a camera inside like chargers or cables.<br /><br />Quality is top notch in construction so I will give it 5 stars, but keep in mind small is in with this product.  I think it would work well with wired microphones as well as cameras.

B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I plugged this into a hdmi chord connected to my tv and my mini-display port on my Macbook Pro and the screen flickered for a while and then did nothing. I looked at the directions and found nothing helpful. My guess is that there is something incompatible with my tv, my hdmi chord, or my Macbook Pro. I haven't found a lot of helpful information anywhere. My Macbook Pro was purchased about 6 months ago so it should work and support even the sound through the hdmi cable. I have not heard of having to buy a special hdmi cable in order to get this to work. I am going to try a few more things and then send it back if I can't get it to work. Overall dissatisfied.

B004JST23A|4.0|Turisas' 3rd full-length album 'Stand up and Fight' is nothing short of an epic Viking/Pirate/Symphonic Metal step in what seems to be an experimentation road they are taking. Fans of Turisas' first album 'Battle Metal' appreciated its more \\"classical\\" and controlled, yet brilliantly intriguing and complex musical structure, while more mainstream fans of the second album 'The Varangian Way' loved it for its kicked up bass, more epic symphonic feel, and overall more mainstream approach to Viking Metal. While both albums were great (the original easily beating out the second in terms of musical prowess), the third album does less of a Viking approach (despite the cover art) and more of a symphonic epic \\"pirate\\" one, featuring songs that don't so much entrance the listener in an old Norse Valhalla Viking world, but more of a 'Pirates of the Caribbean' one. Still, the album does continue to carry the Turisas sound, but the band seems to want to keep the more mainstream approach of the 2nd album while using elements of the more classical style of their first. It does so fairly effectively.     The album opens up strong with the first 5 epic tracks featuring heavy yet controlled slow to mid-tempo power riffs backed by powerful bass, strong symphonic elements that create worlds of ships and giant wars at sea as well as downing ales and getting drunk, grunted and clean deep vocals, and more choir-style chanting than has probably ever been heard by Turisas. While the songs are good, they are more fitting to being played when you are in the mood for something epic and soaring, not necessarily in a mood for heavy metal music. Some songs feature tempo changes, breaks and fantastical fantasy-land style melodies that are most definitely welcome and give Turisas a good flair of beautifying sensitivity. Therefore, do not think that after you've heard the first 2 minutes of a song that you have heard all it has to offer, as these tone changes within the songs do pay off.     Towardsthe end of the album are when things become somewhat to significantly less interesting. The Japanese import version features 2 bonus tracks which are worth picking up if you have the means, but are not as good as the better songs on the standard album, so don't think you're not going to be able to live if you are a Turisas fan and don't get those 2 bonus songs. Anyway, the last few songs on the album still hold an epic style, but simply are not as interesting overall; they are simply not creative or inspired enough to make you want to hit the repeat button. Yet interestingly enough these are the songs that do the most experimenting, yet long time fans will perhaps be turned off by when the songs tend to get a bit too progressive and epic for their own good, playing with the boundaries of Viking Metal and stepping into the realm of Rhapsody-style \\"Hollywood epic metal.\\" One thing is for certain - Turisas seems very interested in creating a catchy album. Yet the problem with catchy albums is that they have a tendency to not be interesting for too long, and before you know it, after enough plays you'll perhaps feel as if the songs sound too played out to still hold the same interest as they were when you first heard them.     So while I applaud Turisas for their experimental approach and mostly successful album in presentation, production and overall performance, they may be on a road to pigeon-holing themselves with an epic style that they may not be able to leave... because if you ask me, while Epic metal definitely has its place, there is only so much grandiose celebration-style Viking/Medieval songs that you can continue playing before the ideas run rather dry and changing one's style will only result in fans looking elsewhere. Still, even with all that said, this is a very good, if JUST short of great, and far from legendary, album that will keeps fans happy before they find themselves overplaying the songs and start demanding a new record. I would suggest that with the next album Turisas take more time and try to not focus so much on \\"epicness\\" yet more on good songwriting with a theme, as they did with the first album. It may sacrifice the mainstream sound but fans will probably be more appreciative in the long run.

B002A32I78|5.0|I think at this point it should be obvious CDs as physical media are dead.  Nobody listens to just cds anymore; if anything, buying a CD is like buying a chore.  You have to rip it before you put it on your ipod, and it's not physically impressive;  A fragil jewel case, a cd you'll never play again, and a tiny useless booklet.<br /><br />But what about Vinyl?  Beautiful cover art, large printed booklets in some cases, a physical novelty that has something of a ceremony behind it, as opposed to CDs.<br /><br />La Roux is a great album, but it's a great vinyl as well.  It comes with code for a DRM free digital copy.  It is literally the best of both worlds, physical and digital without having to rip and encode anything.

B00008H2LB|1.0|Want to know how 'Meteora' came about? A corporate guy in a suit from the record company said to 'Linkin Park' \\"Right, you guys have to make an album full of whining, tortured teen lyrics, with soft-verses and heavy choruses. Mike, you have to do your rapping thing, and Chester, you have to scream like a maniac with fake-pain. EVERY SONG must follow this formula. If you do this, the album will go multi-platinum, and you will become rich. If you don't follow these orders, you lose your recording contract okay?\\". Linkin Park said yes sir, and 'Meteora' became multi-platinum. By the way, they made some terrible music in the mean-time.    Every song is laborious teen-angst catharsis with droning, miserable guitars and cliched melodies ripped out of every other teen-angst-pop-metal song. Every song is exactly the same, no substance and the 'Meteora' is basically 'Hybrid Theory' part 2. Every lyric is predictable 'Oh the pain/ oh you're picking on me' and as deliberately downbeat as possible. There is one good song 'Breaking the habit'. 'Nobody's Listening' has a more ethnic sound, and is also a decent song (but with stupid lyrics).    There is talent in this band, but this album is 1-star bad. Rating *

B000OCXMAE|2.0|After hitting the Nu-Metal/teen world with 'Hybrid Theory' (2000) and 'Meteora' (2003) the band Linkin Park evolved and released their third album of new material 'Minutes to Midnight' in 2007.     While the previous two albums were formulaic teen angst albums, 'Minutes' find LP trying to evolve and mature. They actually succeed to an extent. At least their songwriting is deeper and there are some moments where they play their instruments rather well; there are a couple of good guitar licks in there and a couple of really good songs.     'The little things give you away' is a mesmerising epic that is melodic, well-written and simply breath-taking. The musicianship is excellent, hard to believe Linkin Park could pull that off, after two albums of verse/chorus built on repetitive power chords. 'Shadow of the day' is a pleasant ballad.    The predictable whining that comes with every Linkin Park album drags this down, though. Chester miserably whimpers and screams in every song about his pain and about how everybody has done him wrong. Zeesh, Kurt Cobain's cathartic lyrics had a really bad effect on music didn't it? Not Kurt's fault, he did it intelligently, but some people took the bad childhood thing and milked it to death.     I'd probably give this album a 3 or 2 1/2, however, they ruin it by swearing on two of the best songs. Does Mike Shinoda really feel so pumped about George Bush that he has to swear on the semi-masterpiece 'hands held high'? It is a masterpiece, mix passionate rapping with a military beat and an organ, 'stroke of genius'!. And 'Bleed it out' is kind of fun, again, ruined by some swearing. So with that taken into account, 2 stars; rating **

0061914177|1.0|I thought 492 reviews couldn't be wrong!<br /><br />I picked this book up on the Kindle. To be honest, its pretty much entirely fluff. There is some detail about different social media networks, but really very little beyond what most people already know and definitely way less than I have been exposed to as a 30 year old guy.<br /><br />This book feels like a motivational seminar. It's full of words like \\"do it now\\" and \\"work hard\\" and \\"be passionate\\". I can't believe people think that these were somehow NOT requirements of success.<br /><br />If you want to start a business and really want to develop a way to think tactically, where you can actually finish the book with some action points about next steps other than \\"Joe is crushing it. Why can't you?\\", I would highly recommend Guy Kawasaki's \\"Art of the Start\\". It's also a fairly short book, but really covers startup strategy and gives you much needed information on how to actually do things, like make a good sales pitch or investor pitch.<br /><br />All in all, I have to say this book was a snooze. Every page felt like the page before it and the page after it, and I really gained nothing from having read it. Although, it is short - I read this cover to cover in about 3 hours max. Mostly because I just wanted it to end but didn't want to do myself the disservice of not completing the book I had shelled out for.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|What's the sayings, \\"What people do for love,\\" or, \\"Love makes people do strange things,\\" aptly apply to this foreign movie.  An odd but wonderfully romantic movie with a twist. Where the final scene gives the historic meaning, as it were, to the opening scene's characters relationship.  Yes, parts of the film are violent and gory, but it is a necessary part of the plot's and character's development.  I thoroughly recommend it.
0061726826|5.0|Lena can't wait to get the surgery, that at 18, will cure her of the disease that took her mother - the highly contagious delirium nervosa (or in layman's terms: falling in love). Lena's main concern is passing the exam that will determine her future status in society. But then she meets Alex and soon becomes \\"infected\\".<br /><br />Lauren Oliver skillfully introduces us to a society where people are either afraid of love or are numb to it. For the past 43 years, the government has stamped out \\"messy\\" emotion in favor of a more ordered existence. Most accept it, as having the surgery makes you immune to heartache and pain. But of course, there are those who resist. As an \\"uncured\\", 17 year old Lena, needs to be protected from those resisters, and there are strict measures in place to ensure her protection - a curfew, raiding parties that look for offenders, unisex education and socialization.<br /><br />Though it was a bit implausible to me that a society that abhors love would allow the family unit to remain intact, putting its most vulnerable citizens - those uncureds under 18 - at unnecessary risk (if they REALLY wanted them safe, they'd lock them up in unisex dorms until they got \\"cured\\" - although that still wouldn't keep everyone safe, obviously), the world-building suited the main plot brilliantly. Because, of course, for the story to work, Lena has meet an uncured guy to her liking (and Alex fits the bill) and have the opportunity to sneak out and spend time with him.<br /><br />And DAMN, if I may say so, Lena's scenes with Alex sizzle, making the novel soar to dizzying heights of emotion.<br /><br />But it isn't just romantic love that is so well explored here. Lena has a very close relationship with her best friend Hana that is heart-breakingly real, and we also see snippets of the happy familial love she shared with her mother.<br /><br />The shock ending underlines and gives even more depth to the powerful themes of the necessity of love and the meaningless of life without it. I, for one, can't wait to read the sequel.t wait to read the sequel.
0316069485|2.0|Reversal was not as exciting as I expected, especially after the Lincoln Lawyer. No twists; no surprises. I'm betting Connolly's original draft was better than the final publication. Reversal's ending was a big disappointment, unresolved, making the whole story so predictable. This made me wonder if something was missing, or rewritten at the last minute, or edited out. I kept thinking there would be an amazing revelation of evidence, even down to the last line that would snap it all together ... but there wasn't. Maybe this was a case of bad editing because this is a terrific writer who delivers satisfactory stories. Get a new editor and write again, Mr. Connolly.
B000093FLA|5.0|this is a great Guy Ritchie film the two actors that really stand out in this movie is Pitt and Jones because the way their characters are portrayed in this movie. ive never seen this movie before i bought this just based off reviews that i saw on here. each characters in portrayed in their own unique way one stands out from the other and some are completly different. i also liked Rade Sherbedgia who played Boris is character was great and funny pretty much like all of them. this has to be one of Pitts top preformances along with 12 Monkeys and Inglorious Basterds he plays Mickey in the movie and by the way almost half of his lines you cant understand but that is suppose to be the way the character is in the movie. this movie is hilarious i would definitly recommend this as a buy. GET IT!
0756404738|3.0|I really liked the first book, and this one seemed to carry the same humor and style. It improves on the action and scope; Kvothe travels to a number of cool places, and the prose it a bit more elegant in parts. But, I can't help but wonder about seeing this story as a trilogy, or a longer saga. Kvothe's story takes us through a 40 page nimphe-loving break, and then another 40 page Bruce Lee montage. We end with Kvothe only seventeen years old. I'm not sure how he plans on filling the gap from teenager to tavern owner in the next book. Also, the ending is really not an ending, there are no resolutions, cliffhangers ect... you just turn the page and say, \\"damn, no I've got to wait another three years to see what he did after an uneventful day at the college.\\" And the mystery at the tavern is only slightly present. Really not an ending to have me eagerly awaiting the next book. So I liked the story, but for 1000 pages to fill a couple years with no resolution or building of mystery or suspense, I admit to being let down.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I must admit that I greeted HP and the Deathly Hallows Pt I with mixed emotions: Great excitement and anticipation to finally see the film version of what I consider to be the best book of the series and a lot of sadness to know that this meant that Harry Potter was actually at an end.<br />After having been extremely disappointed with the film version of HP and the Half Blood Prince, I sincerely hoped that this film would be better than expected and it did not disappoint. The scene of Hermione wiping her parents memories and leaving home had me in tears in just the first few minutes of the movie. And then just a few minutes later, the death of Hedwig during the flight from Privet Drive brought me to tears again.<br />This movie included all the important parts of the book while leaving out some of the parts that dragged on a little too long (the many nights on the run in the countryside of England) And the ending of Part I, where Harry, Ron and Hermione are caught by the Snatchers left me breathless with anticipation for Part II.<br />Any Harry Potter that has not yet seen this movie (is that even possible?) should definitely get the video and watch it before Part II arrives in the theatres in July of 2011. You will wish you had seen the film earlier and be anxious for the final film.
B000M341QE|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. All of the stars shined equally bright. Damon and Dicaprio played each of their respective characters great. (I felt they could have done a role reversal, and still nail the characters). Wahlberg also played his character to perfection. But good old Jack stole the show.  Nicholson was amazing as Frank Costello. When he was simultaneously eating lobster and prying a ring off of a severed hand, all while delivering a lecture to his newest protegee...wow.  The Departed had a little bit of everything in the plot too.  Mobsters, dirty cops, troubled cops, moles and rats.  Great flick!
1400063515|4.0|I became curious about the 'Black Swan' notion via a reference from another book; enough so to purchase and read Taleb's work. I found 'The Black Swan' fairly thought-provoking and entertaining, and appreciated Taleb's candor in acknowledging what he 'doesn't know' despite his erudition. I think his skepticism of current established models and paradigms, for predicting future patterns, is healthy, and something we should all keep in mind in our decision making. Current world events (i.e. Japan, Egypt, and Libya) seem only to underscore the validity of Black Swans. The book is a relatively quick and enjoyable read.
B0000C23DO|5.0|If you are an audiophile and a Dead Head (do those co-exist?) you will want to upgrade to the the recently manufactured Dead CDs, which are all now HDCD.

B003QP4NPE|5.0|I'd heard various reviews about this book over the past year. I knew it was a story involving tech.  But since I'm not really into mysteries and thrillers, I was willing to pass on reading it.  Until I heard a quick blub in passing on a blog about AR glasses in the story.  I'm currently absorbing anything I can afford on AR right now.  So I bit the bullet, and decided to give it a read.  I D/L'd it on Kindle.<br /><br />One over-encompassing word:  Wow.<br /><br />The tech involving AR didn't appear until 2/3rds of the way into the story.  But that didn't keep me away.  As a matter of fact, the natural progression the Daemon uses makes perfect sense. It goes from cellphones to the fabled holy grail of personal area networking in such a smooth way, the reader never misses the development transition.<br /><br />This book is almost a prophesy about a possible future.  One that I've pondered in the back of my mind for years.  The collapse of \\"modern\\" society.  Sobol's Daemon acts not to install chaos, but to initiate positive change.  It just does it quite a bit more aggressively.  In this aspect, I'm reminded of Asimov's Encyclopedists in the Foundation series.  The reduction of anarchy into a 1000 year timeline, rather than a 10,000 year timeline.<br /><br />But one line in the dialog of the last chapter really hit home: \\"If the Daemon triumphs, tens of millions will die.  If it fails, billions will die, and we will fall back to a seventeenth-century agrarian economy.\\"  Personally, I see the collapse of the global economy, and the return of small localized farms and gardens.  It could happen.  Fiction traditionally trumps reality.<br /><br />Over all, this is an excellent book!  Don't be afraid of reading it because of whatever hesitations you may have.  It's well worth you time!

B003M8NG94|4.0|\\"Mars Attacks!\\" is based on a series of unbelievably vulgar and gory bubble-gum trading cards issued by Tops almost 50 years ago. They're violent beyond belief, and so grotesque that one has to assume parents would have confiscated them. The set was reissued at the time this film was released, and now sells for at least twice its original price.<br /><br />The movie is tame compared to the cards. Had it duplicated them, it would have gotten an R rating (possibly even NC-17). The scene of the burning cattle is retained, however, and gets the film off to an agreeably weird start. Burton and friends are more-interested in spoofing '50s sci-fi films, and this they do fairly well. (Burton's approach is to underplay the spoof, rather than shoving it in the audience's face.) If you aren't familiar with this -- uh -- genre, most of the humor will be lost on you. But if you've seen \\"Invasion of the Saucer Men\\", \\"Earth vs. the Flying Saucers\\", \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\", and \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\", \\"Mars Attacks\\" will be like a reunion. Not surprisingly, Danny Elfman's excellent score borrows (stylistically) from Bernard Herrmann.<br /><br />Burton supposedly wanted the film to be an homage to Ray Harryhausen, so the Martians were to be stop-motion animated. But good stop-motion takes time and costs money. As the costs began to get out of hand, Warners insisted that Burton switch to CGI. This is unfortunate, because stop motion would have added retro charm.<br /><br />The PG-13 rating is apt. Though this is a comedy, the Martians go about killing humans in an incredibly brutal and sadistic fashion, eg, deliberately toppling the Washington Monument on top of a Boy Scout troop. \\"Mars Attacks\\" is not suitable for kids under 12 or 13, even with parental supervision.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer is excellent; I noted only one white speck. The lack of \\"extras\\" is disappointing, especially considering the disk's list price.
0763644765|4.0|We like this book, as we do all the Leslie Patricelli books. My son especially loves the part when the baby finally goes in the potty and he yells out \\"I did it!\\" It's a fun book, but doesn't clearly teach all the steps of using a potty. If your little one likes Leslie's books, he/she will like this one too. It may be best suited as an early introduction to the potty since it is a board book with minimal writing. It may be too simple for an older toddler and as I previously mentioned doesn't really explain the process sufficiently.

0393068382|3.0|In the second half of the 20th century arose the unassailable civil rights movement, centering on the atrocious and explicit segregation of races as unequal in merit. And as often happens, when an initially justified idea is gotten hold of, it tends to be generalized and carried to excesses in areas where it didn't belong.<br /><br />Prominently this happened in the women's and gays' \\"liberation\\" movements, the \\"victims\\" adopting a \\"me too\\" attitude. The present book concerns the first of these, the Introduction concluding: \\"No one knows whether males and females could ever enjoy perfect equality. But of this I am confident: So long as the counterpoints provided by the work of the many researchers presented in this book are given an audience, in fifty years' time people will look back on these early-twenty-first-century debates with bewildered amusement, and wonder how we ever could have thought that that was the closest we could get to equality.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the author is groundlessly \\"confident\\". But more critical is the ideal that \\"males and females could ever enjoy perfect equality\\". Exactly what perfect equality? And would they enjoy it? Apparently the equality advanced \\"by the work of the many researchers presented in this book\\" implies mainly that males and females are perfectly equal doing any work whatsoever. At one point (p.178), after, \\"In the early twentieth century, [then quoting] 'genius was considered an innate quality which would naturally be manifested if it were possessed'\\", she astonishingly writes: \\"No one now, I should think, would agree with this\\". Later (pp.184-5): \\"what you believe about intellectual ability--whether you think it's a fixed gift, or an earned quality that can be developed--makes a difference to your...performance\\", and: \\"when students are encouraged to see math ability as something that grows with effort...grades improve and gender gaps diminish\\".<br /><br />Then anyone, it seems, could with effort come up with Newton's \\"Principia\\". It always seemed to ignorant me that intelligence is something one is born with and that emerges without effort. But we must trust \\"the many researchers presented in this book\\". It may not sound fair, but I took note that the researchers are predominantly women, and it is difficult, in view of the preconception of \\"perfect equality\\", not to have doubts about the objectivity of those researches.<br /><br />It appears that the larger picture of worldwide and timeless experience that people greatly differ in their capacities, that men and women are inclined toward different interests, is more substantial evidence than what seems unreliable probing into multifaceted behaviors of particular individuals.\\"Principia\\".

0670022411|1.0|I saw how highly reviewed this was.  I didn't love Twilight, but didn't hate it either.  But honestly, I have no idea what the hype is about.  For the length of this book, I feel like I should have digested a lot more than I did.  I honestly feel as if for all that happened in the book, it should have been about a quarter of the length.  The premise is interesting enough, but I think this book failed on execution.  I can only say I read it because I felt obligated after dropping the 15 bux or whatever for the ebook.    Like I said, the premise is interesting enough, and I will say the plot got a bit intriguing in the last couple of chapters.  But if I happen to catch the sequel, I'll make sure to check out a library copy so I'll feel free to bail if it's as slow and painful as this one was.

B003Y5H4SO|2.0|The main problem with this film is the title. Instead of being genuinely surprised by the turn of events in the film, you'll probably spend most of your time waiting for the title character to show up.    If you don't watch horror movies, are scared of the dark, have never seen a Hitchcock film, or are claustrophobic, you might find Devil to be somewhat scary. Otherwise, you will probably be bored with the numerous \\"lights go out and something strange happens\\" scenes.    The acting in Devil is good and the cinematography is great, but with the help of the narrator/security guard, the story quickly becomes laughable. Devil could have easily been a single, standalone episode on a show about the paranormal like Fringe or the X-Files, but as a full-length feature film, it lacks any real substance.    Don't expect Devil to be a horror film, have a good story, or be in any way believable, and you might like it. Keep your expectations low before watching.
B003FSTN52|5.0|I've been watching this series on CBS but I missed the first season and purchased the DVDs from Amazon. The good wife's husband, the Chicago prosecutor, has been sent to prison, so the wife has to return to the practice of law in a large firm to support their children. The continuous problems of the prosecutor holds the series together while the law firm has a different story each week. The writing, stories and actors are all excellent and keep me watching. In the third season, I learned how the prosecutor wound up in prison, but I'm not saying.

B0001Z53F6|5.0|I know they're \\"dead\\" audio formats, or basically are, but I remain attached to DVD-Audio and SACD. Until I'm convinced I've heard something better, these are the best two audio formats ever created -- and the Who's \\"Tommy\\" a great vehicle for both.<br /><br />Of the two versions, I actually prefer the SACD, which is a little warmer compared to the somewhat glassy sound of the DVD-A. But the DVD-A also offers some visual content that's worth one's time, including photos of the band from the original recording session. Better still, a couple interviews with Who guitarist/keyboardist/songwriter Pete Townshend, who recalls the recording of the original album and also gives us information on mixing and mastering the album for the new surround formats. One reason he chose to start with \\"Tommy\\" is that it was recorded in the studio using only eight tracks. That meant fewer decisions involved to get the final 5.1 product.<br /><br />Either version is going to please Who fans. The audio purist probably will prefer the SACD, while the completist should pick up the DVD-A. Or be greedy like me and get both. I usually don't do that but ...<br /><br />... this album was pretty important to me, growing up. I didn't get to hear it when the band released it; I was only 8 years old and I wasn't tuned into such things just yet. But in my early teens, the Who pretty much walked me through a typically troubled adolescence. Roger Daltrey has said on occasion that the band probably saved him from some bad stuff, including a propensity to violence. I'm sure I could say the same thing -- the Who always have been rock's thinking (and yes, guitar- and hotel-smashing) band. Townshend's songs, along with the smaller number contributed over the years by bassist John Entwistle, gave me outlets for youthful anger but also reminded me there were things in this world -- and beyond -- far more sublime.

You will love it, whether you are purchasing it because you have fond memories of reading these stories or because you have young children. What is really nice is that the book brings a CD with all the stories, so if you are tired, or your children want to read along on their own, just pop in the CD and listen.  I liked that the reader gives the child time to look at the pictures, he doesn't rush through the stories and animates the stories well. Unlike one reviewer, I found the binding to be sturdy.
B000KKPN5C|2.0|It's compact but underpowered in low light for bounce flash off tall ceilings, and the biggest problem I experienced is inability to shoot faster than 1/250 when using this flash. That makes it impossible to shoot wide aperture in bright light when wanting fill flash without overexposing your shots.<br /><br />I'd say don't waste your time and go for a flash you can sync with a fast shutter speed.<br /><br />Also, you can't run it wirelessly so I had to buy a 40 dollar off-brand cable, and a 15 dollar diffuser, ...<br /><br />Now since I know more of what I want/need, I'm returning this and getting a larger flash. I saw the SB600 here for 220 which is only 50 bucks more than this when you add all the acessories you need but now it's more so I had to do more research.<br /><br />From what I researched, the SB600 is old technology so I was led to the SB700, but the SB700 has a lower GN and even more expensive than the SB600.<br /><br />I found that Sigma has a iTTL flash that works wirelesly and in high shutter speed sync so I decided to get that as it's cheaper than the SB700 and has a much higher gn at 35 mm (equivalent to the SB900). Will review that once I get it.
B003YNFAWI|4.0|A well done feel good movie. Some of the hallmark Bollywood excessive sentimentality and singing have been restrained. Thank God!! The picture is nice but the 5 channel sound is maldistributed. The rear speakers overwhelm the front and centre speakers many times.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This Soundfly MP3 Transmitter is simply amazing, it plays your MP3 songs with unbelievable digital clarity, completely static free on the radio channels of your choice, I chose an unused frequency to avoid any possible interference.  Best of all is the meager price tag, this transmitter was the answer to all my problems, as I do not care for many of the radio stations here in Las Vegas, especially the constant commercials.  So simple to setup and play, a child could do it, it has been a real joy to own.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|Zoey is a descent character and well rounded, but she is a little too perfect like others have described.  I like that fact that the author included the Cherokee rituals and legends.  This I found intersting to the character and gave it a different back ground then other vamp books.     What I didn't expect was all the symboism to other books and COMIC BOOKS!!  Hello, but did anyone else think that Zoey was the female vamp version of Harry Potter?  A mark on her head, different then everyone else, she has more magic then most her age, and she is a fave of the person in charge.  Then while reading I found a quote from Spiderman's grandfather!  \\"With great power comes great resopsiblity!!\\" Wow! I mean I know most young women don't know much about Comics but that was a blatent rip-off if I ever read one! What was even weirder was that Zoey's grandmother is the one who says this to her and it is in complete comparison to the Peter Parker(Spiderman) and his grandfather.     I am not quite done with the book yet but I will finish it tonight.  This book is kinda short and only took me 2 days to read.  Ill probably read the next one because I do like it.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|A fabulous release of a classic! Every detail has been addressed and upgraded to current Blu-ray standards without compromising the actual films impact and story. A film facelift that actually works!
142311339X|5.0|Rick Riordan is a genius. I had already thought so from the Percy Jackson series, but The Lost Hero has proved it even more. When I first heard he was starting a new series I must admit I was skeptical. I thought \\"How far is he really going to be able to take this?\\" But when I read The Lost Hero, and saw that he had taken it in a completely new direction I was truly in awe and appreciation. Pure genius to take the story in the direction that he did in this novel. It will allow for so many new adventures just as amazing as the original Percy Jackson adventures. I cannot wait for Son of Neptune to be released!!
B0043VCPW8|5.0|Bryan Adams is one of the greats and this album is a fine example of that. It is very much like an MTV Unplugged session. It is wonderful to hear his voice without all the background of the full band. There are some real treats along the way as well while Bryan jokes with the audience, etc. If you are a Bryan Adams fan you will love this collection of songs.
B004G5ZXVQ|2.0|Obligatory part of the review...I`ve listened to REM Since Reckoning, blah blah blah...    Ok I bought this one based on the band's collective past, current reviews and their previous album.  The bands past tells me that they should receive some benefit of the doubt and when the reviews are generally positive, and the previous album was generally good, not great, I decided that all this information tells me to give it a shot.  Not the best decision I've made, though not a fatal decision.  Possibly fatal to my purchasing any REM in the future though.    Anyhow without getting into any song specifics, the whole album has a feel of REM trying very hard to be REM again.  They sound like a band that is trying to be, trying to recapture something from the past, and it does not work for me.  The whole album feels forced and artificial.      I was thinking, if the band was not REM or if this was what they took to the record companies looking for their first record deal, would this album get distributed?  I don't think so.  Bands with a past get measured against themselves and against the market/industry/trends etc... This really hurts REM because they are not measuring up to their past output and they are definitely not comparable to the newer younger bands that they did inspire.  It falls flat and they might want to think about retiring.  They are in danger of becoming the Rolling Stones, a live act that does not produce anything worthwhile on record.
B003KK6GJQ|5.0|I found this book captivating and intriguing. The ending was exactly what it needed to be (an utter let down when I saw the movie). I've read quite a few Picoult books, this is easily my favorite! A great read!!!
0307593495|5.0|Fans of Henning Mankell who have followed his detective Kurt Wallander over the years will find \\"The Troubled Man\\" to be a bittersweet outing.  Sweet because it's the first new Wallander book in a decade, but bitter because Mankell has said that this is the last Wallander novel he will write, and given the book's melancholy, eulogistic tone, I believe him.    \\"The Troubled Man\\" in the title refers to Hakan von Enke, a retired submarine captain. One day, von Enke goes out for his morning constitutional and disappears.  Von Enke happens to be Wallander's ersatz father-in-law; Linda Wallander is in a long-term relationship with von Enke's son Hans.  Linda asks her father to look into Hakan's disappearance.  At the same time, Wallander finds himself at loose ends, taking some leave and some vacation time from work, so he agrees.  There isn't very much to go on; von Enke seems to have gone missing without leaving any clues as to where he's gone or why.  Is it suicide?  murder?  kidnapping?  Then, a few weeks later, von Enke's wife Louisa disappears.    Wallander stubbornly continues to try to unravel the two mysterious disappearances, but what will strike the reader equally is the extent to which Wallander simultaneously grapples with the age-old issue of one's impending decline into old age and one's mortality.  The book is very melancholy in tone, and Wallander does a lot of looking back over his life, trying to understand what brought him to this point, and trying to assuage his fears about the future. In this respect, the \\"troubled man\\" of the title is as much Wallander as it is von Enke.    Fans of Mankell and Wallander won't want to miss this latest, likely last, book in what is a terrific series.Yes, it's melancholy.  Yes, it's got less physical action in it. No, it isn't the first Wallander book a newbie should read. But if you've followed the career of Kurt Wallander over the years, this bittersweet, dark novel is a must.
B000002IRL|4.0|Very heavy but light on the speed. Good album to listen to when not in an all out thrash mood. Great remake of \\"Frankenstein\\". Recommend this one.
B000P0J09W|5.0|The Goonies has always been a favorite of mine. We moved and I lost me VHS of The Goonies. My Grandsons (11 and 8)were having a sleep over at Grandma's. I wanted to get them away from the Wii. I made popcorn and put my new DVD in. The boys loved it so much we watched it twice. This is a Classic movie for all generations.
055380684X|4.0|This book really makes you think about the process of developing talents. I enjoyed all the stories, case studies, and information about how the brain uses white matter to help us learn a skill. One of the main themes of this book is that anyone can develop a talent-it just takes practice-a lot of practice-10 years or 10,000 hours!
B003CM368Q|2.0|I drive an eco car into work all week, this little device makes it a little more amusing.  Turns out this device is also an FM Transmitter for MP3 players.  This is definitely useful on road trips in rentals that don't have AUX/USB jacks.  But you may need another 12V (cigarette lighter) socket to keep your MP3 player charged.    This won't work on some hybrids with dc/dc converters.  All you will hear is the V10 idle through all rpm ranges.  Vehicle needs to have an alternator.    After 3 days of use EDIT:  Ok, not as consistent as I would like it to be.  Doesn't work so well until the car is warmed up.  After a cold start, idle is higher while in neutral, and when you drive the Soundracer doesn't match the RPMs.  It also takes repeated tries to get the Soundracer to match engine rpm.  In addition, certain RPM ranges have static.  Dropped from 4 stars for the giggles to 2, as it wears off pretty quick.
B00127RAJY|3.0|If you have bad knees this video may not be the best choice. I have one bad knee that I'm going for physical therapy for and this video is not kind to it. The jumping jacks and jump rope segments are too jarring for bad knees. I improvise by running around my basement or other aerobic moving around. Overall, it is a quick workout in the morning before work to start your day.     The most aggravating thing about this dvd is that you cannot fast forward through the show commercial or even Jillian's introduction. When you are pressed for time and just want to get to the workout, you waste precious time just trying to get to the darn workout. I was so annoyed with it this morning that I almost just said \\"forget it\\" which totally defeats the purpose of doing it for 30 days. I mean, how many frigging times do you have to watch the front matter of a video?
B001DJLD1M|5.0|It was my greatest pleasure to receive this collection. The Quality was superb the content was even better. Best Movie Series ever! Received it much faster than I never expected it to and it was in perfect condition. Very good price too. A++
B004L3AQLU|5.0|One of the most complex, beautifully written movies I've seen in a long time. I laughed and cried and loved every minute!
141779738X|5.0|When I had this book delivered to my new Kindle- I really didn't know what it was about, but at $5.00 the price was right.     I was immediately engulfed in the story...  reading late into the night and getting up earlier and earlier each morning to read before work.  I just could not put it down.  The entire time I was reading my heart felt like it was being pulled in two different directions...  Sad for all the people and events during WWII and hopefulness that love and kindness would prevail.  I was actually quite sad for a couple of days after I finished the book because I didn't want it to end.  The lesson I learned from this book has stayed with me much, much longer...  While it only takes one persons hateful words to grow a forest of hatred...  it also only takes one persons words to carve a path of hope.  Which one person will you be?
B001RPD06I|5.0|This was my first time shopping with this vendor, and I was very pleased. I received my memory card quickly, well packaged and it was better than I expected!! Thank you!!
B0036OS3PQ|4.0|I wear a size 10.5 to 11 (I think I would be a truer 10.5 but it's hard to find shoes that size). I read about sizing up but the 11 is the largest size and I thought that would work. The boots are very comfortable, soft fleece lining, and I love the purple color. However, my big toe is rubbing against the front of the shoe. Other than that they feel great. But believe the other reviews and make sure you order a 1/2 to even a whole size larger than what you normally wear.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|love it!
0385335997|5.0|I love all the books in this series, but this one is my favorite. If your trying to decide if it is worth reading, don't hesitate just buy it!! This is a book (and a series) that you will want to go back to and read over and over again.
0756404738|5.0|There should be a name for the despair you feel when you wait for a book to come out for years, then it comes out, you read it, it's fantastic, and you know you'll have to wait years more for the next one.  I'm gonna call it GRRM Syndrome.<br />I see that there's more than a few 3, 2, and 1 star reviews.  I can't even bring myself to read them.  It'll be either some clown complaining about Kindle pricing or people quibbling about the story arc. If you're an avid reader of fantasy, then you must admit there's few, if any, with the story-telling skill of Rothfuss.  People might complain that parts of this book drag on too long, but it's so damn fun reading about even the most trifling of Kvothe's exploits that you're a fool to complain.  If you want all action and no prose, go read Salvatore.<br />I could read another 1,000 page book just focusing on Kvothe at the University, Rothfuss just knows how to draw you into even the most mundane of plotlines.<br />If I had one gripe with this book, it's a minor one:  what's with the incessant cat references?  I almost threw my Kindle out the window when I read the 900th so-and-so was \\"proud as a cat\\" line.  He's running dangerously close to the Dean Koontz golden retriever obsession.<br />So let's all just quit complaining and be thankful that there's a fantasy writer out there that can deliver a thousand pages on anything and make it engrossing.  Until the next one, I'll be in the throes of GRRM Syndrome.
0312305060|5.0|This book is as good as the 5 star reviews say it is. I was truly sorry when I finished it and it may be one of the best written books of the last 50 years. The only Virginia Wolf book I ever read was To The Lighthouse, possibly Wolf's finest novel, but not an easy read. However, you don't need to be an avid Wolf fan to appreciate The Hours. Michael Cunningham evokes Wolf's writing style in his attention to details that read like poetry. Imaginative, original and writing that brings tears to your eyes it is so beautiful. No wonder it won the Pulitzer.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Instant, painless device gives a serial port through any USB port.  Fine quality adapter and fool-proof driver.    What are you waiting for?
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I really enjoyed the plot, the history, the science and the magic.  I would have given it 5 stars, had it not been for the ending.  I feel the author should have given closure to this part of the storyline, before moving on to the next in the trilogy.
B003UESJHY|5.0|Up-and-coming boxer Micky Ward is the younger brother of Dicky Eklund, a once-famous fighter now living off the remains of his legend.  Micky wants to shoot for the big time, but with his mother and brother hanging on him, he doesn't have much of a chance.  Enter Charlene, a beautiful bartender who ignites something new in Micky--a will strong enough to break the bonds of family.<br /><br />Sounds like a cliched storyline?  It is.  It's also true, but that's beside the point.  The fact is, THE FIGHTER is a fantastic film.  It's not your average sports movie (until the last half hour or so); in fact, it's not even a sports movie at all.  It's the story of two brothers.  Mark Wahlberg, as Micky, is a knockout (pun intended); he's had a few flops recently, but Wahlberg dives head-first into the role, taking what could have been a two-dimensional portrayal and making it deep and meaningful.  Christian Bale, as Dicky, deservedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, even though he's really Wahlberg's costar; this is Bale at his finest, when he has room to breathe and a character to create.  Best Supporting Actress winner Melissa Leo is fantastic as the boys' domineering (but kind-hearted) mother, and as Charlene, Amy Adams (who was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress) shines like she has seldom been able to before.  Jack McGee, as Micky's step-father, is equally engaging.<br /><br />These performances anchor the film in the here-and-now; this isn't some heart-warming sports flick, it's a story about a family's struggle.  The script is good, though one gets the feeling there's a lot of ad-libbing going on (especially from Wahlberg, Bale, and Leo, who have a great rapport).  Director David O. Russell keeps the film rooted in its Boston surroundings; this is far more of a \\"Boston\\" film than it is a \\"boxing\\" film.  THE FIGHTER is one of those rare films to actually earn all the accolades it has garnered.  Is it the greatest film of all time?  No.  Is it the greatest sports movie ever made?  No--because it's not really a \\"sports\\" movie.  Is it worth your time, and repeated viewings?  Absolutely.  THE FIGHTER is one of those films where you can sit back afterwards and think, \\"Yes, this is how movies should be made.\\"made?  No--because it's not really a \\"sports\\" movie.

B001EN71CW|1.0|Most reviews I've read here were about the series.  Regarding that, there's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said.<br /><br />What I'm rating-- and for which I'm giving one star-- is the adaptation to BluRay.<br /><br />I have purchased the original DVD set, the original release of Serenity, the Serenity DVD Collector's edition, and the Serenity BluRay Collector's edition.  So when I purchased the BluRay Series Collector's Edition I expected something special.  However, the only thing shiney about the BluRay version of the series is the mirror-side of the discs.<br /><br />This is unfortunately, one of the few BluRay releases where I can honestly say the DVD release was better.  I can watch the DVD release in my UpConvert BluRay player and get splendid quality.  However, when I play the BluRay version the picture is grainy to the point of annoyance.<br /><br />I do realize that part of the series was shot in a grainy manner on purpose and have made allowance for that.  But this entire release is grainy all the way through.  Why this is the case I cannot fathom.  Was Firefly released prior to the release of HiDef television?  Was it shot in the old 800x400 standard and therefore did not transfer well to BluRay?  Did someone at the factory not know what s/he was doing, deciding to do a straight-from-DVD conversion without UpConvert standards... or perhaps attempting to push it to BluRay quality and unfortunately resulting with an extremely grainy picture?  I don't know.<br /><br />All I know is that most BluRay movies I've seen I can see the pores on the actor's chin in a close-up shot.  In this release a closeup shot looks like someone Photoshopped the faces with a splatterbrush effect.<br /><br />I am sorry to see that this series was treated with such poor rendition in the BluRay version.  And while this is a recommendation I seldom give:  for those who have not yet purchased this set, I would most definitely recommend the DVD version instead.nd the DVD version instead.
B00004W221|3.0|This sports' story proves that anything is possible. This movie might not be the best sports movie ever made, but it's a fun family story. Rudy has wanted to play for Notre Dame his entire life, and always been told it's not possible. He defies the odds and follows his dream.
0756404738|1.0|Wow.  What a letdown.  This book sucked the life right out of me.  The first one was so good, and then this...  Ouch.  I don't care what the author plans on doing with the third book, it can never apologoze for making me sit through 300 pages of random crap with Denna, who is the most annoying tramp to ever hit the pages of literature.  Then you have this agenda with the highly enlightened society of Adem wherein the women are convinced that men have nothing to do with procreation, and ridiculous sexual promiscuity is one of the hallmarks of proper civilization.  What's more, Kvothe has a problem with having sex with anyone in this society after just coming off a year long sex bender with some sex-crazed pseudo-goddess of love who kills men by over sexing them.  My opinion?  Patrick Rothfuss is trying to get his wife to sleep with him more, so he makes all the women powerful, and all the men insipid cutthroats, societal morons, or neuter gender half men who take all their cues from their inherent supply of estrogen.
630514415X|3.0|A sports movie depicting the pressures on a young star, faced with the pressures of choosing his path in basketball and in life. The characters in this film are great, and they'll draw you in from start to finish. Jesus grows to realize throughout the film the importance of love, family and the biggest decision of his life!
B00004SPVE|2.0|This movie is my all time favorite for no other reason than Tony Scott directing a Quentin Tarantino written script. The DVD is great... if you read the fine print. I purchased, by accident and my fault, a Region 2 DVD. What does that mean? I means only Region 2 players can display it. Where's Region 2, you ask? Ah, well... that would be Europe. I live in the USA which is Region 1. So it was my bad, but still wish a more active effort was displayed by the vendor to illustrate it was not a compatible DVD. Those are the breaks! I should've read closely, or at least wonder why it was so cheap.    Caveat emptor! [Latin ~ beware the buyer]    I felt I truly was romanced into purchasing.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|This movie is one of the ultimate in motivational sports movies. Nelson Mandela is in power and his support of the springboks helps them in the 1995 rugby world cup against the odds. Matt Damon is superb as the south African captain, and the movie is helped along by a top soundtrack of great inspirational songs. Morgan Freeman is a convincing Mandela.
B0001XPZGA|5.0|Some of the best relaxing jazz i have heard in a long time, i really like norah jones style very much so. She's very easy to listen to and you will not hate you bought the vinyl version of this album, i mean don't get me wrong the cd is ok! but only vinyl is the way to go. Vinyl rules and so does norah jones!!!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I haven't finished all 3 phases yet. I bought this to supplement my normal workouts when I can't make it to the gym.    This is well worth the short money, and in my opinion for someone in pretty decent shape to begin with.
0061537969|5.0|This is a well-written book that brought me to tears.   I loved it. It is one of the finest books I've read and it would make a fabulous movie.   It enlarges one's mind and heart.
B004AE34RI|4.0|The Bone Sword tells the story of Malik, a sort of rogue guardsman/mercenary whose been on the run for far too long. He's resigned to the fact that he's a killer, until he meets a pair of blond siblings, Noah and Jasmine, under rather strange circumstances. Jasmine is a healer, but beyond healing Malik's ravaged body she heals his spirit, and gives him something to live for.     When we first meet Malik, member of the Camden Guard and bearer of a bone sword, he seems like an old, battle-hardened soldier, but we figure out that he's really quite a young man (unless my figuring is way off). However, he is world-weary and stricken with a fever that he'd just as soon let take him. Then he stumbles into a tavern and kills the Earl's cousin in mostly self-defense, and becomes a fugitive. Once captured, riddled with wounds and fever, he's dumped in a cart and hauled off toward his execution.     However, he was dumped in a cart alongside Noah and Jasmine, also sentenced to die because Jasmine is a healer and therefore an aberration against the church. They were captured after Jasmine used her gift to save their father. Jasmine heals Malik, a daring escape ensues, and the healer becomes the figurehead of a peasant uprising against the corrupt nobility.     All in all, I liked The Bone Sword. It's got some incredibly awful villains, and really, what fun is it without the bad guys? Jasmine and Noah also mature remarkably during their time with Malik. Also, the writer's style is pared-down and unique, and I don't mean unique as a euphemism for bad. Everything flows well, and I especially like how he handled the fight scenes. I do wish it was a bit longer, with more character development, but for all I know the writer's leaving that for the sequel. I give it 3 1/2 stars.
B000HT3JNY|5.0|I thought this was just going to be another Adam Sandler comedy, but oh was I wrong. Yes it had its funny scenes, but this ended up being one of Sandler's most poignant movies. I was especially touched by a few scenes with Sandler and Henry Winkler. Wow, is all I can say. Watch this movie!
B00005K9LN|4.0|It's funny after reading these other reviews; they will say, this and this song are great, and that song is pure crap, then the next review will be just the opposite.  This is a very solid hard rocking album.  It is a departure from the more progressive experimental side of Priest, to a simplified,yet more concentrated version of their sound, which is heavy and pounding and more radio friendly.  It's like when Metallica made the \\"black\\" album after stuff like \\"and justice for all\\" in a way.  Breakin The Law and Livin After Midnight are still cool rocking songs, but have been burnt out on the radio.  \\"united is like a pub sing along drinking song, kind of an odd one out.  They are all good though. Rapid Fire is relentless, Grinder IS a heavy mid tempo grinder with an almost funky rhythm in the chorus.  Steeler and The Rage Rock. You don't have to be old to be wise is also good.    The difference between earlier awesome Priest albums like Stained Class and Sad wings of Destiny to this would be like you sitting down, smoking a bong and staring at the album art for the earlier releases, to dancing and banging your head at a party on this one!
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|The picture and sound quality on this BD are top notch. As for the performance itself, EXCELLENT. I was only casually into The Killers prior to picking this up, but after watching the passion each member of the band puts into a performance, I'm converted to a full-on fan.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This is a truly excellent film. Though a warning must be place here, it is very dark and may not be for every viewer.     Other reviewers may give away the ending, I will not. I will tell you this film has a very twisted plot line with a surprise ending that you will not expect.    Visually this film is very stunning. Each shot is very well composed and the actors all present their characters in a very convincing manner.     I will say as native speaker of the Korean language that the subtitles are not correct in all of the scene. It appears as if the company that did the subtitling may have attempted to censor some of the language and actual intent of some of the scene.     The most important thing about this movie is that it pushes Korean cinema into a new direction. Most Korean films over the past decades and even into the 21st century have followed a traditional pattern.  They have been very dominated by Korean society and the expectation of the Korean audience. This film steps outside of the established tradition and has moved Korean filmmaking into the next generation.
B003HKN51Q|5.0|If you like this movie, you'll LOVE the blu-ray. At first I was hoping for additional stuff like Turner had done with That's The Way It Is a few years back, but this movie is exactly the same as it was when I was a kid. I'm sure other's have mentioned some audio differences due to licensing (Johnny B. Goode is replaced by Don't Be Cruel in the title sequence, etc).    The picture and audio quality are about as good as you can expect for how old the movie is and the fact that I'm sure the master's where never taken care of as well as Elvis' other pictures.    Overall, it's a great BD release.
0061733199|5.0|If you are looking for the best book on suvival for any situation BUY THIS ONE......<br />Another book you should look for that makes for a good companion to this book is \\"The End Of The Would As We Know It\\".

030746363X|2.0|After reading a few chapters of The Four Hour Body, I can tell you it's a total kickback scam. Lucky for me, I received it as a gift from a friend and I didn't waste my money on it.    Every chapter references a brand name product or service that the reader is all but required to pay for as a prerequisite for achieving the book's claimed results. For example, the Adding Muscle section requires the reader to use a bizarre russian piece of equipment called a kettleball. Almost no gym's have it, which means you are required to purchase a $100 weight.    Conveniently enough, Mr. Ferriss provides links at the end of every chapter that point you directly to where you can buy said products.

B003IWYOF4|3.0|If you haven't bought this on BD yet, I'd hold off. This is a catalog title that will likely be revisited in the future and probably given a far better treatment than this release. Audio and video are better than the DVD of course, but far from the best it could be on BD.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|Two Americans run around Europe jumping off roofs and crashing boats, all the while doing it in fake British accents -- no wonder Europeans can't stand Americans!  \\"The Tourist\\" is a completely stupid, completely absurd movie, held together by the charisma of two of the most charismatic actors in Hollywood history.  Jolie and Depp are just fun to watch, even when it's obvious they're so bored by it all.
B001E1EOQ0|5.0|Bought this BD about a year before the US one was issued. The picture quality and (arguably more important) sound quality are top notch!
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Natalie Portman yet again dominates a film, and she's brilliant and mesmerizing in a brilliant and mesmerizing film.  \\"Black Swan\\" is the story of art as a fatal obsession, how actors must live and breathe their part in order to be perfect.  This was the theme of \\"The Life and Death of Peter Sellers,\\" where Geoffrey Rush portrayed a man who could never separate reality from fantasy -- and this schizophrenia would be the source of Sellers' genius.  Portman in \\"Black Swan\\" takes this theme to its deadly extreme.
B003KZZ4TO|5.0|The vinyl version of Recovery sounds FAR warmer than the CD counterpart I keep in my car. Good buy if you like the album.
0553805371|5.0|`Elegance' is the first criterion that the authors introduce to assess models with which we may question the nature of the universe. Its economy of text, easy style and masterful explanation of physical theory also qualifies The Grand Design for elegant status. Obviously, any potential readers will be guided by one look at its size and layout to realise that it is not purporting to be an exhaustive exposition of any area of science. Setting the scene with the concept of model-dependent realism, whereby apparently discordant laws may be utilised productively to solve problems within a certain range of operation, Hawking and Mlodinow use many broad-ranging concepts including Feynman's `sum over histories', quantum electrodynamics, Feynman diagrams, the `ad hoc' standard model, super-symmetry and M-theory. Scientific explanations are always very clear, peppered with humour, and saturated with excellent illustrations.      The last chapters of the book are more conjectural, surveying whether the evolution of the universe and life can be explained scientifically or through miraculous creation. A little history and logic are employed, working through the weak anthropic principle and then, almost teleologically, the strong anthropic principle. Having covered the appropriate background, the final chapter returns to the `why' questions asked at the beginning of the book. The authors look to M-theory for the big answers, and use a simulation to show how organisation and life could happen in our universe. The arguments here are good, although the lack of footnoting and bibliography to support arguments was disappointing for a book of this general quality.     It is likely that any criticisms of The Grand Design will focus on the final invocation of M-theory to answer some of the big questions. A little research will suggest that M-theory is more tentative than Hawking and Mlodinow indicate, however I would propose that it is probably less tentative than the alternatives, or lack thereof, offered by critics. I would vastly prefer to learn from a book that is ambitious in its scope and theories than a timid canvassing of options, and laud The Grand Design as the former.
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|The BD is Easy A is fantastic. Great video quality, crystal clear sound. If you like the movie, you'll love the BD.
1400052173|4.0|Written clearly with facts and without acrimony, this is a story of medical misuse of a person who may have received good medical care for the times but not good respect or consideration of her as a person, nor her decendents who asked \\"what happened?\\" A compelling read on what could have been a dry topic.
B0035G1K7S|5.0|The picture quality on this BD varies depending on how it was shot. But it always looks as good as it can. The sound quality is fantastic and over the movie is excellent.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I received this order very quickly.  It was in excelllent condition and nothing wrong with any of the discs.  I am a huge Gilmore Girls fan, so having every episode has been wonderful! Remind me again how it got replaced by the stupid show pretty little liars?<br />I have ordered several things from amazon.com and I have always been happy with the results!

0547258305|5.0|Could not put it down. Can not wait to get the next book, ordered it as soon as I was done with Graceling.  1 star reviewers don't know what they are talking about, great book.
B001UW58YK|5.0|If you like Buble, you'll love the included performance. The picture quality is fantastic for being sourced from 1080i. The sound quality is reference material and you could use it to show off/test ANY surround sound system out there.
0596804822|5.0|I'm a six year OpenGL/C++ guy, including two years of iPhone dev, and I'm still learning new things from this book.<br /><br />This book is a bit rote, even for an Oreilly text. So it may not be the book for you if you like \\"Dummies\\" books. But it covers just about everything you need to know to develop 3D applications on iOS.<br /><br />Much of the knowledge can also be ported to other mobile platforms, which is one of the best incentives for adopting OpenGL for your application.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|GREAT movie about guitar. Even better blu-ray! The picture quality is fantastic and the sound quality gives you a \\"You Are There\\" feel. If you love guitar, music or both, you should buy this BD!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger Games, written by Suzanne Collins, is fiction in the young adult genre. This is not my age group, but I found that I couldn't put it down! Don't let the Scholastic Publishing label discourage you. This trilogy is a combination of nerve-racking tension, thrilling action, and an engaging love story which is appropriate for young and older adults.     I was amazed on how completely engrossed I was in the plot and characters.... This story is set in the future where the government oppresses its people and forces children from ages 12 to 18 against each other in a fight to the death in The Games. Everything is televised and highly publicized all over the country. Katniss, the main character, must not only survive the Games, but deal with a romance between her and another \\"tribute\\" from her home, resolve if she is willing to kill as a \\"pawn\\" of an oppressive government, and/or be the symbol of hope and freedom.     I highly recommend reading this trilogy.
B003S897P0|5.0|THIS is how retrospectives should be done! Some are straight forward re-recordings of classics (Remedy, She Talks To Angels) others are almost completely new or semi-new arrangements (Share The Ride, My Morning Song) that only improve on what was there. The tracklist itself is FANTASTIC for any Crowes fan or someone looking to dig a little deeper. I love that they included stand out versions of fan favorites like Cold Boy Smile and Girl From A Pawnshop.    As for the vinyl itself; great packaging, high quality vinyl, sounds much warmer than the CD version of the album I keep in the car.

0061703087|4.0|I love books that look at where technology could possibly take us (If you have any good recommendations, send them to me).  This was a great story and Michael's research was impeccable. As an engineer with a keen interest in technology, I was impressed with how plausible the premise was.  Of course, there were some stretches but still, everything mentioned seems realistic enough to make this tale thrilling but still, cautionary.    Some reviewers have said that the ending seemed rushed.  I agree.  I think it was to balance out all the technical information needed in the beginning to lay the foundation.  Still, I enjoyed it thoroughly.    A good read.

B003F76HFC|4.0|It took a little while for me to get into this story.... and I'll admit -- there seem to be a lot of characters that you need to keep track of - but I actually enjoyed this book.  I'm a huge Sophie Kinsella fan, but haven't had much luck when it comes to books written under her name Madeline Wickham.  They're a little darker, and although this book wasn't exactly a light hearted romp through wedding chaos, it worked.  The story is very twisty-turny - lots of subplots along the way, but at about the mid-way point, I couldn't wait to finish and find out how everything gets sorted out in the end.  All in all - I quite enjoyed the story.
B0009PVZWI|5.0|Technically, I should have given this album a one-star rating, because the single CD version is copy-protected. This means that no one can copy the music files onto their computer.<br /><br />However, I think this album alone was also part of a huge revolution in the music industry, where music nuts started to move to the Internet to download music.<br /><br />This is also one of the best albums that the Foo Fighters ever made. It includes some of their greatest hits, including \\"Best of You\\" and \\"D.O.A.\\" If people hadn't fallen in love with the Foo Fighters before, \\"In Your Honor\\" completely changed their minds with grandiose chord progressions, edgy staccato chords and catchy lyrics.<br /><br />The album is divided into two halves, reflecting the two different sides of Dave Grohl's band. The first CD includes most of the band's loud power chord songs. The second CD focuses on their subtler acoustic sound.<br /><br />Both halves make for an intriguing look at how grunge music has changed from the old days of Nirvana.<br /><br />Although this album sparked a load of controversy over the problems of music piracy, it also provoked many people to switch to the Internet as their source of music. For once, this was one of the only albums that people could only find in mp3 form over the Internet.<br /><br />It was an intentional move that shifted the tide of the music industry. In fact, the band released an album after this one, completely devoid of copy protection. People hated the band, but this CD actually gave them a much edgier persona in a slowly developing indie music scene.<br /><br />Certainly, \\"In Your Honor\\" is hard to recommend based on the firestorm it caused about Internet piracy. However, it's worth buying as an unusual icon of the late 2000s. It's one of the few copy protected albums that you are completely unable to listen to on the iTunes application.<br /><br />Don't worry--the Dual Disc version doesn't have copy protection on it.
B0042MEQVG|3.0|the special effects in this movie are definitely improved, but the story line is becoming tiresome.  After reading other books in this genre and watching more adult movies, I found this a bit slow and definitely \\"young adult\\" fiction.  If I seem to be reviewing the book, I'm not.  the movie just seems a bit tedious and even confusing at times.  Great for the \\"Club Edward\\" and \\"Club Jacob\\"  set, but not a serious movie, even for vampires.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I do not believe one could find more beautiful music in any concert hall. It is a pure source of joy,love and hope all wrapped up in sunshine. Perhaps becouse it is born from the heart and soul of its creators. It is the best medicine I have taken in years. No matter what your troubles, it will uplift you and carry you away to a far happerier place and a better tomorrow. It is a collection of songs that every one can enjoy. My grandson and I listen to it faithfull every day when I pick him up from school. We have even started to research the words to \\" Chena Momma \\"  becouse it has become important to us.
0670022411|4.0|Even with all the vampire books out there, this one is really different and written for people who appreciate good writing as well as a great story.  Can't wait to read the next book in the series.  The main characters are not at all what you expect from this genre, 4 separate \\"species\\" living together in a sort of truce, but the humans unaware of the other three.  As the main character fights her own heritage and abilities, she finds that her denial may no longer be possible as the creatures' worlds begin to collide.  Very entertaining!

B0040UAYI4|5.0|I held off buying any console because I could never get used to playing FPS's with the console controllers.  I just needed the precision and quickness of a mouse and keyboard.  The PS3 Eagle Mouse and Keyboard Converter comes darned close to the PC mouse and keyboard.  When I tried this controller out I did get precision of a mouse.  However, because games are made with a controller deadzone in mind you won't get the snappy response as opposed to a conventional PC mouse.  It comes close, but not quite.  Mind you, the inputs you make on the mouse or keyboard is a 1 to 1 input and response.  There is no lag.  Just the slower panning of the mouse.<br /><br />There are many caveats when it comes the Eagle Eye and the PS3.  Not all mice are compatible with this unit.  That is why I bought the Logitech G500 Programmable Gaming Mouse which is widely known to work and perform well with the Eagle Eye controller.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />A list of compatible mice can be found here: [...]<br /><br />Now for those that complain about jagged vertical movements when zoomed in when playing an FPS game, you must adjust 3 different things.  The mouse DPI, the game's sensitivity, and the threshold within the PS3 Eagle Eye Mouse and Keyboard Converter.  For Uncharted 2 I set the game's sensitivity to max.  The G500's DPI set at 800 I believe.  When I zoom in and want to snipe I turn up the DPI on my mouse to 1600.  Set the Eagle Eye X sensitivity to 5 and the Y sensitivity to 7, I believe.  The movements are butter smooth.  Thanks to the logitech mouse with on the fly DPI switching I can now play console FPS's with the mouse and keyboard.<br /><br />You will not have six axis capabilities in games like Killzone 2.  Honestly though, the six axis movement is gimmicky.<br /><br />I did polish off Uncharted 2 using the Eagle Eye and I can say that my experience was great!  Getting headshots was easy.  Conquering the crushing difficulty levels was not too hard because I could use my trusty old mouse.<br /><br />A warning though about other games.  I was able to play Metal Gear Solid 4 using the device.  However, sneaking was impossible.  You only move one speed when using the Eagle Eye, and that is full out run.  So I was forced to use the PS3 controller when playing Metal Gear Solid 4.<br /><br />Honestly, I do prefer the PS3 controller when it comes to action games like God of War.  Games like God of War do not require much precision.  Combos feel better with the controller.  However, FPS's that do require precision and less combo button pressing would benefit from using the Eagle Eye Converter.<br /><br />Another perk with the Eagle Eye controller is that there is a good community supporting the device.  A good community means great feedback and advice to optimally configuring the device.<br /><br />I do not own other console mouse emulator hardware so I cannot make any comparisons.  I did a lot of research and it seemed that the Eagle Eye Mouse had the most positive reviews.  Thank god I made the right decision.ames.  I was able to play Metal Gear Solid 4 using the device.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|I really love this movie.  I have watched quite a few of the Jane Austen adaptations and in contrast, I like how the Dicken's movies have this gloomy wash or feel to them.  You just know there are going to be a lot of surprises and things you wouldn't expect.  I watched the movie with the captioning on the first time because it was hard to hear with kids around. The second time I watched it, I knew what they were saying and it helped understand what was going on.  I really love some of the characters. Ones that I thought were self-serving turned out to be very dear and warm-hearted. I feel that I have become accustomed to these movies being 600 plus minutes long.  Any shorter is a disappointment.  Bleak House is another great movie if you like \\"Little Dorrit.\\"
B0015DROBO|4.0|I, too was disappointed in the first part of the book.  But I never put a book down once I start it.  About half way through, it got really good. It's worth the effort.
0385491026|3.0|Some discerning readers spotted that the second half of the book does not live up to the expectations set in the first half. I agree. The first half was captivating. I applaud the author's insight into a vast array of human emotions and her talent for putting these into words, which she manages to do in all her books I've read so far. She has a very 'realist' way of writing, delving into the nooks and cranny that make people tick, pretty much a psychoanalysis, which showcases excellently in Cat's Eye where she gets under the skin of characters from a range of ages. The second half of the book however is riddled with trivial and uninteresting details, and the plot is somewhat gratuitous, such as the affair with her art teacher, the casual fling with her ex-husband, her's brother's death - adding little value to the underlying theme, as if she had lost the plot of the novel herself, and was just writing to fill the pages. We lose sympathy and empathy for Elaine's plight (the lead character) and the connection between us and her emotional state becomes muddled. This part of the story reads like a diary, tracking her past and present until the two periods inevitably meet. It's a fast read so probably worth reading if only for the first half.
B00003CXSP|2.0|In \\"Hannibal\\", I was looking for an epic battle of wits between the escaped, brilliant Hannibal and the focused, brilliant Clarice. Instead, for most of the movie we get Clouseau vs. Hannibal. At the same time Clarice is getting steadily beat down within the ranks of the FBI until she is finally put on suspension. Then we find that for some reason not well explained, Hannibal regards her in some sort of fatherly way ... though a predatory father to be sure.<br /><br />While this movie had less gore than I was expecting it to, it made up for it with some very unpleasant forms of graphically displayed death. This includes not one but TWO sequences of people being eaten by hungry boars. I suppose that is fitting, since hungry bore could well describe the director and screenwriter for what essentially became a waste of time for an intelligent viewer.<br /><br />Into the mix is thrown a horribly disfigured, extremely wealthy man with a grudge against Hannibal, and Hannibal didn't even exactly do the disfiguring, though he did encourage it. In the end this man's aide turns on him to gruesome result, and the motive for THAT is as thin as it gets too.<br /><br />While \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" was riveting, this film was drivelling. Hannibal's actions were all too predictable, and the general fates of everyone involved were telegraphed virtually from the beginning of the film. After 30 years of increasingly graphic violence in film, even the \\"gross out\\" scenes in \\"Hannibal\\" brought nothing really surprising or audacious.<br /><br />After the energy put into this role by Hopkins in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", in \\"Hannibal\\" there was surprising little personality put into the character. Hopkins played him throughout as smug, thoughtful, and vindictive, but with none of the smarmy charm or sudden outbursts that in his first performance made the character engrossing if, well, gross. Moore is no Foster, either. In only a few scenes does she try to raise a real emotion, and those seem quite subdued compared to the circumstances which are meant to provoke them. Liotta brings some real reverse charm to his character, but it is so entirely unbelievable that his efforts are wasted. Even Gary Oldman is held back to smug in a mask. How do so many fine actors fail to deliver on the promise inherent in such meaty roles? I'll have to blame the director, who was evidently going for a feel that just didn't work in the finished product.<br /><br />Sadly, Hannibal is likely to put you to sleep, sans nightmares.circumstances which are meant to provoke them.

B003LFLPTQ|5.0|This episode marks the return of the Weeping Angels, undoubtedly the scariest Doctor Who monster from the new series. The Doctor is called to the rescue by River Song, who manages to find evidence of a Weeping Angel hidden aboard the spaceship Byzantium. After the Byzantium crashes on an alien planet on top of a maze of the dead, the Doctor leads Amy, River and a band of clerics trying to neutralize the Weeping Angel, through the maze.    This really was one of the most brilliant episodes of a very good series of Doctor Who (possibly the best series of new Who). River's entry is fantastic, as is the mystery about her imprisonment. Amy Pond shows once again why she is turning out to be one of the best-loved companions of all time, and one of the most intelligent ones too. The whole story was as interesting as the first part of a two-part story goes, and sets things up nicely for the next episode. Among my favorite moments is Moffat's homage to The Ring in the scene where Amy encounters a recording of the Weeping Angel. The bit where the Doctor and his companions find out the truth concerning the Applants is also a fantastic bit of writing. The hints were there all along, and it took every bit of Moffat's genius to spring such a huge surprise on the viewer.    As far as the acting goes, Alex Kingston is wonderful yet again as the enigmatic River Song. Ian Glen is very good as the straight-faced cleric leader, Father Octavian. Karen Gillan shines in multiple scenes as Amy Pond. Matt Smith is very good as the Doctor, although he does seem rough around the edges in some scenes. It kind of makes sense, since this was the first episode of Series 5 that was filmed, and I guess he was still trying to figure out his way of playing the Doctor.    Overall, a genuinely entertaining episode, which makes the anticipation of watching 'Flesh and Stone' all the more unbearable.
B00005QGAZ|3.0|I used to walk to this Music when it was a tape.  The music was as I remembered it, but I didn't like all the baloney comments which made up at least half of the CD.  Even though the music was great, I would not buy this again or recommend it to anyone.  I don't need to hear Quincy Jones or others talking -- I only want to hear Michael Jackson
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie was great.  It actually held my 17 month-old daughters attention.  I was suprised!!!!  My husband and I enjoyed it too.
B001PJRAUS|3.0|This movie/miniseries could've been good in so many ways.  The concept is intriguing; after all, what Jane Austen fan would NOT like to be magically transported into one of the greatest love stories of the era?!  There are a lot of positives going for this:  many of the characters have been wonderfully cast (this is my favorite Mr. Wickham & Mr. Bingley by far!), the settings are lovely, the costumes are exquisite, Mr. Darcy smolders just as he should.    Unfortunately, there are a lot of negatives as well:  1. Mr. Darcy --as wonderfully disdainful and moody as he is-- wears on his face the most comical look of disapproval for most of the movie.  Uncock that eyebrow a wee bit, won't ya?  It makes you look silly.  2. Amanda Price...oh dear, where do I start?!  Even I --an uncouth and unrefined American-- would've been able to bluff my way around Jane Austen's England better than this character!  She's crass, she stands there with mouth gaping open for most of the movie.  I agree with previous complaints:  for someone who'd been well-versed in \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" since she was 12 years old, Amanda Price should've just KNOWN BETTER!  She sounds like a blithering idiot for most of the time.  She lies and manipulates; she says and does the most ridiculous, cringe-worthy things!  3. Given #2, how is it comprehensible that Mr. Darcy would fall in love with Miss Price?  It's just silly! There is nothing redeemable in her character, except that she is obviously fond of the Bennett's.  She shows no great substance in the movie, nothing that sets her apart as decent or worthy of his affection.  Just baffling.  4.  Elizabeth Bennett--what the what?!  How on earth, since we know the great affection with which she holds her sister Jane and father, can she so suddenly and completely abandon them?  Does not compute.    So there are obviously some flaws in the portrayals of the characters, though not (in my opinion) as many as some reviews would have you to believe.  I was entertained by the further delving into some aspects that Jane Austen never touched (Mr. Collins brothers, LOL!, Lady Catherine de Bourgh as an ally, Miss Bingley's secret, hehe).  These do not fit with the *original*...but I don't feel they do much harm to the integrity of the classic.  Artistic license and pretty funny, at that.    Overall, the movie is entertaining, but not one that I think I can watch over and over (after the first time through, I had to fast-forward through all of Miss Price's social blunders and verbal diarrhea to make it tolerable.)  But...Mr. Darcy (as portrayed here) is smoldering and moody and very, very engaging to watch!

031603438X|3.0|This is a fascinating account of the Rolling Stones that is obviously written by Keith Richards, and not a ghost writer. In it we get a personal account of the crazy and tumultuous lives of this great group through the many years of their epic career.  While this book tells us a lot about the Rolling Stones, it also reveals a lot about Keith Richards as a person.  Many are aware of his problems with heroin addiction which ended decades ago, and will be fascinated with his account of how some of the Stones' most memorable songs were written and their escapades with law enforcement determined to bust them for drugs.  In his ramblings, Keith comes across as an intensely emotional person who holds grudges.  He remains angry towards Mick Taylor who committed the \\"unpardonable sin\\" of choosing to leave the group in 1974. Keith says he \\"did nothing\\" after leaving the Stones, which isn't true. Surprisingly, Keith has even more negative things to say about Brian Jones who co-founded the Stones back in '62 and Anita Pallenberg, who is still the mother of three of his children.  The other Rolling Stones have had little to say about these people, and have been much more charitable generally, when asked, but not Keith.  A great musician and song writer, but, definitely, not one to \\"forgive and forget\\"! Many Stones fans will enjoy this inside account of the people Keith shared his life and career with, and what it is like to be in a rock supergroup but he could have been more gracious towards those who helped him reach the top of the music industry.
1423113381|5.0|Rick has done it yet again.  I was hesitant on buying this book, because truthfully, I thought nothing could compare with his Percy Jackson series.  I was WRONG.  This is just as thrilling and adventurous.  Don't miss out.  We are excited for the next one to come out in May.  I bought one for my nephew, and he too, was thrilled.  I love that there is so much history.  Rick has taught us much about the Greek gods and now Egyptian history.  He is a gifted author.
0385732554|5.0|The Giver is a highly acclaimed piece of adolescent literature by the author Lois Lowry depicting the life of Jonas, a 12 year old boy living in an enclosed society. The setting appears to be a perfectly controlled environment in which all aspects of life are chosen and managed for the characters. Although the community seems to be a utopia in its appearance of perfection and sameness, Jonas quickly realizes the sacrifices which have been made to obtain such an illusion.         Even though the main character of this book is 12 years old and the book is only 208 pages long, the subject content makes this book appropriate for a wide range of grades and adolescent students. I personally believe that both middle and high school students (as well as adults) would find this book intriguing and thought-provoking, enabling stimulating discussions. The book provides students with numerous critical thinking opportunities, including topics on pain, memories, emotions, knowledge, freedom v. security & peace, euthanasia, diversity, and the price of perfection. Social Studies teachers could use this text to talk with students about systems of governments, such as socialism and capitalism, along with potential pitfalls when people relinquish power to the government for concessions. English teachers could make text to text connections with other books featuring dystopias such as The Hunger Games Trilogy by Suzanne Collins, Lord of the Flies by William Golding, Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, and Animal Farm and 1984 by George Orwell.    Teachers should be aware that potentially controversial topics for younger adolescents, including euthanasia and sexual development, (sexual dreams being referred to as \\"stirrings\\") are portrayed in the The Giver. Overall though, The Giver has no foul language or references to drinking, drugs, or alcohol and only limited reference to sexual matters. It is an excellent and engaging book for adolescent students who are ready for riveting discussions and powerful lessons.

B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I think I finally understand what it means to be a hater. Because I hate her. Because I think she is so great, so honest, so beautiful, so real, so talented... her voice...her words...her music... it's all too much for me and it fills me with so much intense emotions that I can't define or contain them. And it makes me hate her.     That is probably the realest and weirdest album review... but that's how I feel. Being confronted with such raw beauty, so simply presented, it overwhelms me. Draws me in like some siren song and makes me ache to get closer, to hear more, to absorb it all...    Seriously, I love this album. Not even as much as I love her first album, which concerns me, because I really love this album.     I want to shove her.
043902353X|5.0|This is the second part of a trilogy so don't expect the crisp newness of a 1st book and the chaos of a final book.  This book didn't get the best reveiws of the 3 but without it there would be an enormous hole in the plot line.  ;-) This book helps us transfer from Katnis the co-winner of the hunger games, to Katnis life after the happy ending...  People don't think this book was as exciting as the first, but I find it to be more satisfying.  This is a look behind the scenes, behind the mask of the capitol.  And for me that's my favorite part.  The deep dark secrets, the dirty underbelly, the machaveleon deceit revealed.  I love this book.  Think of it like this.  Hunger games and the appetizer(for most people it's their favorite part of the meal)  Catching fire is the main course.  There is a lot to it so don't expect the whole book to be completely in the arena.  And book 3...well that comes next so I won't spoil your dessert.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Excellant action movie. Keeps you on the edge of your seat through out the movie. This was filmed in our back yard so to speak. Film crew and actors were great. This also helped our local economy during their stay.  Another great movie with Denzel Washington, Chris Pine.
0756404738|5.0|While not quite as good as The Name of the Wind, this is still an amazing book.  If you loved TNotW, you will love this one as well.  If you didn't, you won't.  That being said, I think if you don't at least like these books a little, you are dead inside.  You don't have to love it as much as I do (I thought The Name of the Wind was the best book I've ever read), but if you actually dislike it, I would be amazed.  There was a single chapter in this book less than 100 pages in that made me laugh out loud and cry.  And there are many other beautifully written chapters and entire sections throughout the book.  It is a monster at close to 1000 pages, and some sections are slower than others of course, but overall it was gripping, moving, entertaining and just a great book.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Finally! A wonderful movie the whole family can enjoy that doesn't bear the \\"Disney\\" label! Despicable Me will have you and your family in stitches within the first few moments of the movie. We enjoyed the 3D theater version as did everyone else in the theater with us. One theater goer was in tears by the end of the movie from laughing so hard. She had to have been in her 80s. We've since seen the movie in our home at least 20xs or more. This is a movie you will not tire of watching over and over and over again!<br />Gru (the main character voiced by Steve Carell) has been acclaimed as the worlds greatest villain until he is trumped by another newer and younger villain who steals the Pyramid of Giza. Gru decides he will not be out done and sets out to \\"Steal zee moon\\" with the help of his hysterical Minions (think weebles with arms) and his evil scientist. What follows is a comedic series of moments and mayhem as Gru attempts to accomplish his goal by adopting Agnes, Edith and Margo from a girls home with the full intention of never keeping them once their usefulness has passed. The girls quickly worm their way into the hearts of Gru and his minions. Toss in to the mix Julie Andrews as Gru's not-so-loving mother and Russell Brand as his hard-of-hearing Evil Scientist and you have the perfect movie!<br /><br />If you want a more in-depth look of the movie (I hate spoilers!) check out the previews and reviews on youtube.<br /><br />Just a FEW quotes you will walk away with:<br /><br />\\"It's so fluffy I'm going to die!\\"<br />\\"That book was accidentally destroyed maliciously.\\"<br />\\"Piranha Gun ... Oh Yeah!\\"<br />\\"You got to be pulling on my leg!\\"<br />\\"Oh yeah, my pinky promises.\\"<br />\\"I said Cookie Robots...Cookie Robots\\", \\"Why do you have to be so ...so.. old?\\"
B000024JEX|5.0|This collection is pure heaven to listen to. The playing is impeccable, though some of the solos are a bit long for my taste. Few others can state a melody like Jarrett.    What really makes this collection shine is the sound of the piano. It's the best I've ever heard, at least on a jazz album. Tuning, voicing, mic placement, etc. are all as close to perfect as it gets. It would be enjoyable to listen to a five-year-old play \\"chopsticks\\" through this setup.    The song selection is great. \\"Days Of Wine And Roses\\", \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\", \\"Lament\\", \\"In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning\\" -- these are tunes that don't get recorded often enough. And Jarrett's original, \\"No Lonely Nights\\", is a real stunner.    This collection is a must-have for any serious Jarrett fan, and will make a solid addition to the library of anyone who enjoys jazz trio.
B0017KP93U|4.0|Disc One: I'm well aware the band had no input on this collection, but guess what, half the collections on the market for any band are that way. Onto the songs. First off I think they needed this really. Six albums out, it was time. At 17 tracks I think it's a good amount of songs. My only complaint really is I wish it was in chronological order. However then it would have been easy to see we've got one hit from their debut and SIX tracks from The Bends. As good as that album is I think 4-5 would have been enough, making room for another couple songs. Maybe a b-side or live cut. Still, this is a hits album so it's hard to argue what's included. This is after all meant for the new fan, or the person who thinks they only need one Radiohead release, whoever that guy is.<br /><br />Disc Two: Like alot of people I'd call a 1-disc Radiohead collection to skimpy, which is why I got this version. Plus I found it extremely cheap, so. This adds another 13 songs, 30 in total which is sweet. You could call them...the minor hits, fan favorites or whatever. It's pretty much the songs you wish were on the first disc, but obviously couldn't be for lack of space. Only one from The Bends this time which is fine, because here we get our b-side and live cut. Both great. Plus two more from Pablo Honey (the most overlooked album). If I could add one more track it would be \\"How Can You Be Sure\\" from the soundtrack to the movie Nowhere.<br /><br />Let me be the 100th person to say that The Bends, OK Computer and Kid A really are essential albums to own. Just ask Rolling Stone. But if you're not that committed, this 130 minutes won't be a \\"let down\\".
0375507256|5.0|Rocks roll, and no grain of sand stay in the same place when David Mitchell writes a novel. He is a writer of invention. He demolishes something - namely the novel - to reinvent it. His \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a fascinating experience to the reader that can be amazed by the creative structure.<br /><br />Composed of six interrelated stories, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a set of Russian dolls, one inside the other. Mitchell opens them - one by one - and when he reaches the last one - which can't be opened - he starts to closed them. Each story has some element that will be mirrored in the following one, and caught up later in the second half of the book. This is ingenious and mesmerizing, because it keeps the reader waiting in anticipation for how Mitchell will tie up or bring back elements. The structure is shaped in V, with chapters ordered 1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2,1.<br /><br />Reading \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is not an easy experience - but the rewarding comes in the same measure as the demands. The advice is to get lost in Mitchell's prose, in his bizarre stories and characters, and so that the reader can be found. Some segments of the novel are more appealing to some readers than others.<br /><br />But, in the end, the execution and Mitchell's smartness is the most appealing characteristic of the entire book. Because the book is so, so creative, with such a curious structure that it seems to devour itself. Mitchell reinvents the novel as a reading experience, and his scope of themes and characters virtually covers every human journey. It is a pleasure to read, but, it is also exhausting - and that is what makes the novel unforgettable.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Having easily watched the 10th Anniversary DVD over a hundred times, I was very anxious to see the 25th Anniversary.  The first time I watched it, I was disappointed.  But after watching it again - and again - those disappointments all vanished.  There's a learning curve that we 10th-Anniversary idolizers have to go through.    From the very beginning I had complaints: What are those big screens up there?  This isn't a football game!  It's disorienting!  Can't they tell a simple story without all this gimmickry?  And why are the overhead lights moving?  Who would want to sit under those big contraptions?  Some of the songs sounded different.  It seemed that they cut-out some material, making the story-line harder to follow.  But now all is forgiven.  I feel this 25th Anniversary production is wonderful.  Here are some random observations:    The song \\"One Day More\\" is (in my opinion) the most wondrous song in all of musical theater history.  All the different characters come together at the end of the first act and in their own voices, singing their own songs, assert their reason for living.  I agree with another reviewer that this was not exactly pristine.  But with everybody expressing their own wills and singing their own words at the same time, it's SUPPOSED to be a bit cacophonous.  Even the 10th Anniversary had some messiness in it.    I thought the 25th storyline was more clear in the scene with the bishop, because the silver candle-holders were actually handed to Valjean, however it was less clear in explaining how a runaway cart was lifted by Valjean and how another man was arrested as a Valjean look-alike.    The 25th was special in showing Valjean tearing-up his yellow card and declaring that \\"another story must begin\\".  Then the stage went dark and the name \\"Les Miserables\\" displayed on the screen.  This suggested that the play was only now beginning - that everything before was just prologue, just exposition.  Wonderful touch!  (Disney is also good at movingly introducing the title after an extended prologue - especially with the movie Pocohontas.)    Like another reviewer, I too jumped off the couch and ran up to the screen when I saw the old Valjean from the 10th Anniversary appear on stage.  When he later stepped forward, I thought he was going to thank the audience, but instead the soft sounds of \\"Bring him home\\" began in the orchestra and I was ecstatic.  It was also wonderful to see the 10th Marius, as ebullient and powerful as ever.  It was touching to see the 10th innkeeper, such an endearing-looking man.  I had trouble recognizing the others.  Was the 10th Inspector there under that beard?    Speaking of the innkeeper, the 25th innkeeper was made to look evil whereas the 10th was made to just look seedy.  Both were great.  However I preferred the 10th \\"Master of the House\\" song because Valjean and the others could be seen sitting in the background laughing and clapping and singing along.  It was like an intermission.  I also thought the 10th \\"One Day More\\" was extra touching because Valjean and the Inspector were standing next to each other.    The 25th Fantine was just magical. I could not look at her face during her solo after she got fired - her expressions were that powerful.  I was surprised at the difference in height between Fantine and her boss and wondered if he might be wearing 'elevator shoes'.    The 25th little boy (Gavroche?) was very special.  He enunciated so clearly while maintaining that impish smile.    I was grateful to see the actual composer, lyricist and producer come on stage.  I feel so indebted to them for having brought such joy into my life.    One last thought: there is a depth to this work that becomes more apparent on multiple viewings.  Be SURE to enable subtitles so you can read what they are singing, otherwise the learning curve will be much longer than it need be.
0670022411|1.0|I enjoyed Twilight. I love Harry Potter. This book is a half-baked combination of the two, for adult readers. I can't even finish it. If you want to read many, many pages about how it is necessary for a woman to submit to the control of her vampire love, well, you might get through it. There's just nothing exciting here. Wait- I did like the vampire/witch/daemon yoga classes. That was cool.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I try to read Dickens' Christmas Carol every year during the week of Christmas. It's always worth it.    I read it this year while waiting at an airport in the middle of the night during a snowstorm the day after Christmas.    The story always seems fresh to me. And haunting. And inspirational.    It's a cool way to end the year with reflection on how we lived up to that point and also to begin the new year as we ponder how we want to live going forward.    Get this book. It's free. And it's good, moving, Christmas literature.
B004I2K4DY|3.0|Unfortunately, having grown up watching and listening to the 10th Anniversary Les Miserables in Concert, I found the 25th Annivesary performance underwhelming.  I think my main complaint was the casting of Nick Jonas as Marius.  Although a decent singer, the 17 year old pop star did not have the skill or emotional depth that was required to portray a leading man's struggles with love and revolution.  The highlights were definitely Lea Salonga's intriguing return as Fantine instead of Eponine and Alfie Boe's vocal talents.  Encore performances by the original cast at the end of the show were also a treat.  However, if you want to see this musical's performances at its best, I highly recommend the 10th Anniversary in Concert instead!

0439023521|5.0|You just know it when you read a pop lit that will turn into a classic!<br /><br />Current Young Adult Pop Literature has been plagued with weak protagonists.  It seems that authors who want to make it mainstream think that humanizing their main character(s) to get more people relate to them would have to involve making them look 1) intelligent but not wise (or vice-versa), 2) self-centered, 3) good-looking but with low self-esteem, 4) the object of affection by 2 or more people, 5) the center of the universe or the direct opposite of it.<br /><br />The protagonist of the novel is not any of that.  The protagonist starts off really strong, and surprisingly, develops even more as the story unfolds.  There are novels where you feel torn between liking or hating the main character.  In this book though, you will be rooting for the protagonist after reading the 1st 2 paragraphs.<br /><br />Though the main plot is quite archetypal, the author has successfully stirred it in such a way that it feels fresh.<br /><br />The author also used accessible language.  She has shown her talent by writing profoundly without the use of words which will make you whip your dictionary out of your pocket.  When some authors use sesquipedalian torrents to feign astuteness, she conveys wisdom with simple juxtaposition of words.<br /><br />There are some books where the author would distract the \\"beat\\" of your reading by suddenly putting in flash-backs or describing the scene.  With this book, telling of the past and the description of the situation were all seamless.<br /><br />In the quagmire of poorly-written Young-Adult books that plague the reading world, this book is a breath of fresh air ... a beacon of hope for future writers .. a reminder to them that breaking from the mould is sometimes worth it ...<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if 20 years from now, a young reader will be reading this review while considering buying \\"an old book\\" because I truly believe that Katniss Everdeen will stand the test of time.

B000FBJAOG|1.0|I bought this title expecting the book to be at least mildly amusing given the author's heritage. No such luck.

B004HO6HYI|3.0|Out of 9 Loriens on Earth, there are only 6 survivors.  When the alien hunters known as Mogadorians kill the third survivor - killings are sequential - the fourth Lorien knows it's time to put on his track shows.  Sounds good, right?  Well wait until the YA source material kicks in.<br /><br />Number 4 is \\"John Smith\\" (Alex Pettyfer) a kid whose appearance was perfect for casting purposes, but moronic for plot purposes.  You see, John wants to fit in, to blend, to hide in the shadows.  Despite his guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant, who gets far too little screen time) possessing some serious powers and better computer hacking skills than those in Napoleon Dynamite's dreams, John is nonetheless going to stand out since he's the prototype for every \\"big man on campus\\" since the 1950s.  In their new location, John goes to school and immediately bonds with Sarah (Dianna Agron), the clich&eacute;d social outcast who is far too beautiful to actually be a social outcast in any school known to humanity.  The two soon spend time together admiring Sarah's photography, John's ability to throw a pigskin a quarter mile, each others' attractiveness.  The Twilight formula ensues: staring contests, inane dialogue, more staring.  Then the Mogadorians show up to kill John.<br /><br />We don't really know WHY they want to kill John, or why they're going in order.  Maybe it's some sort of celestial Hatfield vs. McCoy thing?  We also don't know what's up with the one-by-one approach to the murders.  Maybe they're following some interstellar Lorien phone book like Arnold in Terminator?  Maybe this is just a poorly done YA version of the Predator series?  And that's probably the biggest flaw of this movie.  Too many loose ends.  There are several more that I haven't mentioned.  Nearly nothing is revealed about the feud, the extermination, the history.  Do they live next to Alf or Klingons?  Do they have special powers on their home planet like they do on Earth?<br /><br />The aspect I quite enjoyed was the combined special effects and action.  There were clear, crisp renditions in which the scene could be realized, absorbed, and appreciated.  The fighting scenes, with or without magic, were well choreographed and fully developed.  Special powers are appropriately extraordinary, with lasers and lights popping up with vibrancy and power from just about every orifice.  Even when John's \\"dog\\" gets in on the action it's exciting and filmed from appropriate angles and speeds.  Take note special effects coordinators and cameramen; the shaky-cam is not necessary.  In fact, we're sick of it.<br /><br />Since the source material was originally for doe-eyed, hormonally imbalanced 14 year-olds, you can guess where this film ends up.  Rest assured, goodness and justice prevails, with hints of future righting of the universe's problems.  I guess the intended audience would be perpetually distracted by the cast's dreaminess, which is fine for this type of movie.  The subplots were too underdeveloped for me, however.  Decent popcorn movie for date night.<br /><br />Jasonpecial effects and action.  There were clear, crisp renditions in which the scene could be realized, absorbed, and appreciated.

B00028HBKC|1.0|I watched the Passion of the Christ with my atheist husband.  While we were watching all of the blood and guts flying around.  He asked a wonderful question.  What is the point of this movie?  What is the movie trying to say?  Then I realize that he is totally right this movie doesn't really say anything.  All we mostly see is Jesus brutally dying on a cross and flashbacks of his life for cheap thrills.  I am a Christian and I thought that this movie really didn't have a point.  I already knew that Jesus suffered before he died; it didn't really affect me seeing it so graphically.    What I mean is that if you see it from an atheist's point of view, there is no point to the movie.  The movie doesn't tell us why Jesus was dying on a cross.  Since the movie's focus is on Jesus' suffering, the message gets lost to non-believers.  Personally, I was more affected by the Book of John than by this movie.  Jesus had a lot of love for people in that movie and you couldn't help but love Him.  You don't get that watching this movie.    Now I would recommend this movie to people who really hate Christians and love seeing artwork of crucifix's mutilated.  You guys can watch Jesus suffering over and over again and laugh your heads off.
1594202842|5.0|There's a saying in tennis:  \\"too good.\\"  That's when the shot is so good, it is simply \\"too good\\" to defend.  Point for the opponent.  That's what those of us who write and publish books would say about the mega-publicity one Amy Chua and her publisher have generated for her book \\"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.\\"    \\"Too good.\\"    You name the medium, she's been there.  NPR, BBC, NY Times, New Yorker, and every place in between.  Hundreds, maybe thousands, of reviews, blogs, essays.    You can write the greatest book in the world, but if no one knows about it, well.....(some of our greatest literati's were lost to obscurity in their own time, Melville, Whitman, but I digress).  Amy's offering is not Melville or Whitman, to be sure, but it is great sociology, and if publishing were acupuncture, this particular needle hit the mother lode of the energy field, and tapped into all the aspiration, guilt, ambivalence, pride, joy and frustration of being a parent, circa 2011.  All the buttons pushed here:  parental, familial, educational, dare I say it, racial?  \\"Are Asian mothers the best?\\" many writers ask.    And the ruckus in the aftermath, supporters and attackers?  -- would make the WWF proud.  The chest beating, the panting, the feints, the blows.  The oversize belt buckles shining in the spotlights.  The sweat, the blood, the chairs flying through the air.  All generating more publicity, more sales.  Positively viral.  Hats off, gentlemen, as composer and critic Robert Schumann said when introducing Chopin to the masses.    As I write this, the fey and well-spoken Yale Law professor's tell-all family memoir ranks very high on Amazon.  I recommend it, read it critically.  Then read Jill Bialosky's \\"History of a Suicide\\" to get the (tragic) flip side of a coin - a story about a girl who had neither a tiger mom nor tiger dad.  The reading combo will change the molecules in your brain, and prove the worth of a tiger parent, once and for all.
0393072231|5.0|The most fascinating thing for me was how those who saw the fall coming were able to believe that their perception was correct despite everyone else in the financial industry being so giddy with enthusiasm for these bonds. Each of those different stories is interesting to me-- so the book has a human interest side that differentiates it from others on the same subject.      Some argue that the author held a different position in 2007-- but he never claims to be one of those that saw things coming-- he is telling a very interesting story in hindsight- but interesting none the less!
1591843790|5.0|Let me start off by saying I am biased.  I have been a fan of Guy's ever since I read Art of The Start.      Quite frankly I was thrilled when I heard he was coming out with Enchantment, since this epitomizes his skill.  He has built on of the most loyal followings over the years.  Unlike many short lived surges of communities, Guy has a community of loyal followers that have been with him for a decade, plus.    The book does not disappoint.  It is written very similarly to Art of The Start with easy to identify sections. In Enchantment he focuses on the pillars of influence - be likeable, be worthy of trust and have a vision (something that people can follow).    While it can be argued that these are obvious components to influencing others, it seems so many companies (and people) fall short.  I find it refreshing to be reminded of these pillars.    The book is a good reminder and is written from a guy who lives the formula.  For me, the fact that the knowledge Guy departs is 100% consistent with who Guy is, makes the book remarkable.      I finished reading it in 3 days (it is an e-a-s-y read) and have already referred to it.  I expect I will be going back to it many times over the coming years.
B002ZTQVGQ|2.0|Miyazaki just cannot hold a story together.  He has ideas spewing out his fontanelle but it's rare that he can corral them all into a satisfying story arc.  In the past I've put this down to a culture clash.  But even that doesn't save this movie.  It feels like it was adapted from a book - a very long book which Miyazaki is just hitting the highlights of.  Who are these magical folk?  How and why?  Where?  If you feel like you need answers to these and many other questions, just keep moving.  Problem is, you can't just let the wonder of the animation flow over you because the closer to the end it gets, when everything should be coming to a crescendo, Miyazaki starts to stick in pointless static scenes.  If you're hoping for an ending that matches the frenzy of the middle, well, too bad.  There's some good animation of prehistoric Devonian fish swimming placidly - there's some elderly ladies who can run - that's about all I can do for you.    Okay, M said it's a movie for the kids (I guess).  But this sells kids way short.  They can follow the arc of the little mermaid, why shouldn't they expect a compelling reason for the happenings here?  I imagine that anybody old enough to match subject and verb could summon up the confusion to ask why the moon was coming closer to earth.    You get the feeling that there's going to be a grand \\"test\\" for the little boy - oh man, here it comes...  Then the movie's over.  Turns out <SPOILER> the test is simply will five year old boy promise to love the little fish girl no matter what (which, BTW, he has done nothing-but for the whole stinking movie).  I mean, really...come on!  Did he just take marriage vows or...?  I hope Ponyo doesn't turn into a nag or little boy is going to have a 300 foot sea goddess with serious hair extensions out to open a can of whoop tuna on his little bohiney.  I guess being a goddess doesn't help you see that the whole thing is just a summer fling and they'll both meet cuter people in 1st grade.  Sad really.    So I'm being harder than I should be on what was, for 2/3 of its length, a fairly magical movie with many wonderful moments.  But I'm tired of everybody giving Miyazaki a pass on story.  If George Lucas had put together such a confused narrative every Starlog website would be alight with raped childhoods.  Ironically, this is a movie that DEMANDS a prequel to explain how any of it actually happened.  Plus we'd get more of that hot 300 foot redhead sea goddess.    P.S. Wonderful Japanimation People - it is okay to wander away from the standard anime character models that were tired by the time of Speed Racer.  Please do so.  And FYI, nobody's mouth gets that big!
0061726826|5.0|I really did love this book.  There is nothing to say about what happens because it spoils the ending.  While I read descriptions of the book I did not realize what exactly was going to happen.  I guess that is a good thing...  The characters are wonderful and you will fall in love with them.  And remember them.
144937980X|5.0|After ten years of absence from programming (mainly Delphi and, yes, assembly language), one morning I had an idea that required me to jump in again. I didn't want to spend time and money explaining to some subcontractor how to make a feasibility study. I wanted to \\"feel\\" it my self. First I downloaded Processing and started tinkering with its clever examples. Then I decided upon a few reachable details of my personal project. Then, during two evenings in bed before falling asleep and a few km commuting by train, I swallowed this nice and useful book. It reassured me profoundly. Then I jumped in. Wow. I still am not regretting neither the few dollars nor the few hours spent on this book. All Processing tutorials and examples are OK, but consolidating this knowledge by reading the book was a winning decision. This is a must-read for anyone who has an idea of programming and wants to learn Processing (or Java, for that manner) by exploiting those times where accessing a computer is simply not practical.
B004HGBUVG|4.0|Lucinda Williams has one of the great voices in American music. When you combine that voice with interesting lyrics, expert production and superb accompanying players the result is, necessarily, a cd of the first rank. One reviewer complained that this record is a downer. Please! Life isn't all lollipops and roses! Some of the greatest expressions in art are not exactly happy or uplifting (Picasso's Guernica, The Grapes of Wrath, A Clockwork Orange). After a decade or more of so-so releases Lucinda is back with a bang and I couldn't be more pleased.

1847879071|5.0|I wanted a stats book that would tell me how to select analyses, run them in SPSS, and interpret the output, and that's exactly what this book does.  The terms/jargon/formulas are kept to a minimum.  This is a very practical, very easy to use book.  Andy Field is TERRIFIC and making concepts clear, getting to the point, and even making me laugh while trying to figure out if In need to run an ANCOVA or a repeated-measures ANOVA.  Great, great book.      If you're really into stats and numbers this might not be the book for you.  If you're looking for how to run analyses in SPSS, and do it well, and you don't feel the need to know how to do it by hand, you will love this book.  Highly recommended.
0670022411|2.0|I was surprised this book had such good reviews.  It was pretty interesting, and I like the actual story line, but almost nothing happens for pages and pages on end.  I can't even remember how many times I read about Diana wearing ratty leggings, loafers, and a black turtleneck or Matthew \\"snarling\\".  Cut out the long-winded explanations and Diana and Edward necking like teenagers in corners and against trees and you could easily shrink this book down 150 pages.  I just couldn't get over how Diana and Matthew are exactly like Bella and Edward, except dowdier and older.  Diana is fiesty one minute, but then the next totally submissive and does whatever Matthew wants and cries and whines about losing her parents 30 years ago constantly.  Matthew is Edward all over again, elegant, ridiculously over-protective and bossy, telling Diana what to do and when to do it. Anyway, I bought this thinking it would be a novel that stood alone and think that the author could have successfully made it so, but I might still buy the sequel and plan on doing a lot of skimming just to see what happens.

1439102724|2.0|Sing You Home: A Novel by Jodi Picoult<br /><br />I've read every single novel written by Jodi Picoult.  My Sister's Keeper is one of my all-time favorites, as are Nineteen Minutes and The Pact.  Picoult has immense talent and a solid reputation for handling tough themes and developing fascinating, flawed characters.<br /><br />That said, I struggled to finish Sing You Home.<br /><br />In her own words, Picoult writes that this novel examines \\"what it means to be gay in today's world, and how reproductive science has outstripped the legal system. Are embryos people or property? What challenges do same-sex couples face when it comes to marriage and adoption? What happens when religion and sexual orientation - two issues that are supposed to be justice-blind - enter the courtroom? And most importantly, what constitutes a \\"traditional family\\" in today's day and age?\\"<br /><br />Shortly after Sing You Home begins, the main character, Zoe, miscarries a baby in her 28th week of pregnancy.  She and her husband Max are devastated, as they have endured years of fertility issues and are emotionally and financially drained.  When Max decides he can't handle any more, he leaves, and divorces Zoe.<br /><br />Max, an alcoholic surfer turned-landscaper (um, what?), is unsympathetic at best.  After he's nearly killed, Max becomes a born-again Christian, but still doesn't manage to grow or learn from his mistakes.  Meanwhile, Zoe reconnects with Vanessa, a high school guidance counselor, and throws herself into her work as a music therapist.<br /><br />Zoe has an admirable passion for music and the way it can impact a person's life, but is also quite naïve and a bit selfish.  Zoe is desperate and obsessed with having her own child, and never really entertains other viable options - adoption, a surrogate, giving a home to a foster child in need, or remaining childless.<br /><br />When Zoe falls in love with Vanessa, they marry, and decide to have a child.  A predictable struggle ensues over the three embryos that remain from Zoe and Max's fertility efforts.  Instead of Picoult wrapping up the novel with a twist or cleverly disguised finale, the ending is almost anti-climactic.  It is too perfect, too easy, and too implausible.<br /><br />I listened to this novel on my iPod, which included a soundtrack from \\"Zoe\\" (Ellen Wilber sings, Jodi Picoult wrote the lyrics).  If anything, the songs were reminiscent of Joni Mitchell, but without the talent or lasting impact.<br /><br />I wanted Sing You Home to be a thorough, sensitive, smart exploration of gay rights and religion.  A portrait of people who learn from their experiences, or at least, have the potential to grow.  I hoped the novel might include people who acquire some level of tolerance.  A place from within seeds of acceptance can grow and flourish.<br /><br />It didn't happen.s fertility efforts.

B002ZG980U|1.0|We looked forward  to seeing this movie.  Were we disappointed.  It was like watching another X files movie with a different cast.  We never did figure out the plot.  Gave the DVD to our grown children and asked them to explain it to us.  Have not heard any explanation yet.

6301966562|5.0|Back in 1984 I saw the trailer for this film and decided that I had to see it, though I could not get anyone else interested to see it with me. This was four years before I had my own personal computer, but there was something about the film that I knew would be special. Ok, the plot line, about how a simple accident turns the computer Miles buys for work into a sentient creature who falls for the same girl downstairs that Miles does, is a little silly, but the characters and the story move along and by the end you are as happy as the characters all over the world who are hearing the same song on radios and TVs EVERYWHERE (remember there was no Internet yet), and dancing up a storm.<br /><br />The \\"Duel\\" between the girlfriend (who is a cellist) and the computer upstairs (she thinks it is Miles) as they jam together is wonderful- the Giorgio Moroder music is a plus, and another level is the wonderl, nostalgic '80s style to the whole film. Sit back and enjoy it- and let's hope it comes out on DVD soon!!!!
B00495Y030|5.0|I loved this book.  I loved how richly the characters were drawn and the different perspectives on the events that took place.  I enjoyed the themes of what it means to be a \\"good\\" person and to do good things.  I also related to the effort that parents made to do the right thing for their children and how no matter how hard you try, you can get it so wrong.  I could not put this book down.  It is a big read, but I found myself making opportunities to read it.  It is our book club book and I will be very interested to hear what the others in my group thought about it.  The only downside, from a book club perspective, is that there are so many themes and ideas running through the book, it might be hard to focus the discussion.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|Loved from the first listen! I know that some fans of the band won't like this album. It's certainly different from what's come before in many ways. The harmonica in particular seemed to bother a number of people. If you're a fan of Wilco, Ryan Adams, The Avett Brothers, etc., then this will be right up your alley. Not to say that this is just a foray into atl. country. It's much more than that.

I recognize that this is their \\"cleanest\\" album, but that hasn't turned me off. For one thing I can let it run 2 or 3 times before my wife even notices (not likely to happen with Thickfreakness). I feel like some fans dislike it simply because it will appeal to a broader audience. I doubt any of them would actually say this is a bad album if they'd never heard of the band. If it generates new fans, that will hopefully draw more attention to previous albums.
B00003CX5P|2.0|As I watched The Phantom Menace in it's first days on the big screen I kept trying to find a reason to like it.  I told myself, great special effects, good use of computer graphics...  But I realized the cause was lost when Qui-Gon and Obi-wan were in an underwater chase scene with a giant fish and I hoped the fish would catch and eat them.   Each hero seemed a cardboard cut out of superman at various ages dressed in desert rags.  There was super boy, super young man, super dad, super wise man.  Okay, they had obvious super powers, but I didn't like any of them .  The \\"King\\" was there, dressed in splendid robes, but he was a bored caricature of his former self. I preferred the scoundrel Han and naive young Luke both reluctant heroes wanting to impress a very believable princess, and all three on a journey of self discovery.  In the original trilogy the special effects were fine robes on characters I would want as friends.  It was American Graffiti in space.  Unfortunately, the Phantom Menace contaminated the second movie.  It seemed stuck in the ruts of the first, great special effects clothing wooden or unlikeable characters.  I only bought the third movie of this trilogy on DVD but I am the happy owner of the original (unrenovated) trilogy in both VHS and DVD.  I hope Mr. Lucas rediscovers the value of the human condition that he displayed so well in American Graffiti and then in the original Star Wars trilogy.
0316098337|4.0|When an adult writer assumes the perspective of a young child, too often the result is a character that seems contrived, a tone that is more childish than child-like, and a story that is just plain awful.  That being said, Emma Donoghue manages to succeed, terrifically, in projecting the smart and authentic voice of a five year-old boy, a child named Jack who has never known the world beyond Room, an eleven-by-eleven foot structure he shares with his young, kidnapped Ma.   Frankly, I wanted to put the book down after the first page, but I suspect that this inclination was influenced by my having to watch this TV show my son is obsessed with in which grown men talk like babies. (It seems like there are grown-ups doing a terrible job of imitating children everywhere these days.)  However, because I was assigned this book for an education class I'm taking, I read on, and I'm really glad I did.  I had planned on reading the first chapter of ROOM before taking a break, but I found I couldn't put it down and finished it in one sitting.  Jack emerges as a very real, very likable boy, and as much as I pulled for him, I kept anticipating that saccharin sentimentality and that all-too-perfect unity that seems inevitable in stories about children.  I'm happy to say that that moment never comes.   More than that, ROOM is a narrative that, though deceptively simple, offers an abundance of metaphor, compelling the reader to reconsider the Room we all inhabit.  I hasten to say, however, that Donoghue doesn't convey meaning in annoyingly obvious ways, something so difficult to avoid when projecting a child's voice; rather, Jack's observations are unassuming, and the meaning inherent in them is organic.   Because it is so accessible, because Donoghue never condescends to the reader or to Jack, and because it so effortlessly invites critical thinking, ROOM is a novel that would be perfect for almost any secondary level classroom library. However, aside from using it as a literature circle choice, or perhaps as a companion for a research project about abduction (I found myself looking up cases like Jack's the moment I finished reading), I'm not certain that I would formally assign this novel.  I think it would have tremendous appeal to reluctant readers, and for that reason, I would most likely give a short, oral book review to the class.  I would read the first chapter aloud and leave it on the book shelf for a Sustained Silent Reading session, though I'm sure someone would walk off with it before long.

B003UESJHY|5.0|I wasn't originally interested in this film. I thought, \\"Oh, it's another boxing movie.\\" Even seeing a few clips out of context, I didn't think it was going to hold my attention. But, with the awards it won this year, I figured I'd give it a shot. I am so glad I did. I was hooked every second. Everyone did a phenomenal job playing these real people. After watching the \\"making of\\" video included in the special features of the BD, you will understand how great of a job they really did. I was amazed particularly at Christian Bale's performance. He deserved his Acadamy award, he became Dicky Eklund: look, mannerisms, voice, everything.<br /><br />I would almost say Christian Bale was the real star/main character of the movie. The focus seemed to be around him more than Mark Wahlberg, even though it followed Micky Ward's early career. Although, it's really the whole family, and their dynamic that is the main character/focus of the film. Yeah, it's a movie about a fighter, but that's just the setup, it's a prop. The movie is about this family, specifically the brothers and their love.<br /><br />This isn't just a movie for guys that want to see something about a \\"fighter.\\" This is a movie for men and women, both, with elements that everyone will enjoy.

B004NEDI8A|4.0|A Serbian Film (Srdjan Spasojevic, 2010)<br /><br />Purveyors of overtly sexual, extremely violent, or a combination of the two, films used to have a name: exploitation filmmakers. While they've always been known for pushing the envelope, most of the time it was envelope-pushing for envelope-pushing's sake. And there's not necessarily anything wrong with that; every once in a while you'll come across an ecstatic review for Russ Meyer, H. G. Lewis, Hideshi Hino, the Dark Brothers, Gaspar Noe, Eli Roth, etc. that's ecstatic because said director's film, whichever it may have been, pushed the envelope in an enjoyable or artistic way (I just read Jonathan Rosenbaum's quick explication of Noe's I Stand Alone in his book Movie Wars, so it's not just us amateurs out there saying \\"hey, some of this stuff is actually worth watching\\").Down the years, however, \\"exploitation filmmaker\\" has come to be nothing more than a euphemism for \\"porn purveyor\\", and when one talks about exploitation filmmaking in the twenty-first century, one is almost always talking about porn, unless one is referring to one of the old greats or using the term in a somewhat twee manner. I submit that this is because, in America at least (and, I suspect, many of the other major film markets), we're somewhat blissfully unaware of the film culture in Eastern Europe, where old-school exploitation cinema has been rolling grandly along ever since the fall of the USSR. And if anyone these days should have a license to make exploitation films, it's the constituents of the former USSR. After all, under Stalinist socialism and post-Stalinist capitalism alike, these folks have been exploited through and through. This is a great thesis statement for a paper on Bela Tarr As Exploitation Filmmaker, but that's not what this review is about. Instead, I'm looking at Srdjan Spasojevic's A Serbian Film, a 2010 release that did everything, on the meta level, an exploitation film is supposed to do: it generated endless amounts of controversy, got savaged by the critics who deigned to review it, and garnered more publicity than any other film that's come out of Serbia since the fall of the USSR. Actually, let me rephrase that: no Serbian film in history has ever had news of its existence reach as many ears around the world as has A Serbian Film. Now, if Spasojevic were Herschell Gordon Lewis, or even Gaspar Noe, whose films usually have some sort of underpinning of social commentary even if it's never fully explored, that would probably have been reason enough to make his movie. After all, where there's smoke, etc. But Spasojevic is actually making a serious movie here. It bleeds social commentary, quite literally; A Serbian Film is the first true gorenography film, not that there have been many, that actually works as a movie rather than as a series of cheap (in every sense of the term) thrills. It's no surprise that the critics hated it; most of them have never run across a gorenography flick before, given that most of them are shoddy, stupid direct-to-video productions aimed, like most exploitation cinema, at making a quick buck. Spasojevic, on the other hand, is giving us the dark, ugly underbelly of Alexei Balabanov's absurdist 2007 film Gruz 200 (elsewhere in this issue), and for much the same reasons. Balabanov was already headed for the outskirts of the envelope with that one, albeit in a Pirandello kind of way. Spasojevic, on the other hand, sees nothing at all funny about the situation, and the result is one of the most brutally depressing movies I've ever sat through.<br /><br />Milos (Underground's Serdjan Todorovic) is a retired star of any number of low-rent Eastern European porn films. (In one of the film's rare touches of humor, Milos keeps his cash in a dvd box for a film he made called Acockalypse Now.) Spasojevic is not going to soft-pedal you into the movie; the opening shot shows us Petar, Milos' son (his age is never given, but he's in the vicinity of eight years old; pertinently, the actor playing him is uncredited, at least on IMDB), having stumbled upon a DVD called Milosh the Horny Stud, which he's in the process of watching, somewhat confused, when his mother Marija (The Beautiful Blue Danube's Jelena Gavrilovic) catches him at it, prompting a family discussion about Milos' former profession. (Porn, Marija tells Petar, is \\"like cartoons for grown-ups\\". Given the current state of the US porn industry, indeed.) Milos, as it turns out, has revisited the film because his co-star, Lejla (Dorcol-Menhetn's Katarina Zutic; I know you don't recognize that name, so I'll let you know that I've heard it referred to as the worst film to ever come out of Serbia), has asked to meet with him. They do, and Lejla has a proposition for him: do one more film, with a mysterious director named Vukmir (Next's Sergej Trifunovic), for which he is promised enough money for his family to live in comfort for the rest of their lives. You've seen enough movies to know what that promise means, but Milos hasn't, and after talking it over with Marija, he decides to go ahead with the project given the amount of money involved. It becomes obvious, with the secrecy of the filming and the odd choices of sets, which Milos is only introduced to as we are, that something is very, very wrong here. While you've most likely heard about many of the depths this wrongness goes to, I'll not spoil it for you other than to say that this movie goes places you've never seen in a serious movie. Ever.<br /><br />Even many of those critics who have most savaged it agree on one thing: once it's got its hooks in you, you're along for the ride. No matter how depraved, brutal, and ugly Spasojevic gets, you cannot force yourself to stop watching the parade of decadence in front of you. In an odd way, it reminds me of Tinto Brass' infamous Caligula, with the caveat that Spasojevic has more filmmaking acumen in his left elbow than Tinto Brass had in his entire career, not to mention a better vehicle for getting his point across. Yeah, he ditches subtlety (if anything about this movie can be called subtle) and smacks us in the face with his comparison between obscene, disgraceful pornography and his country's situation, but he only does it for one scene, and it actually makes sense in the context of the film (Vukmir draws a comparison between exploitation filmmaking and Serbian society while attempting to convince Milos to work for him). Perhaps more appropriately, given that, imagine Anthony Burgess, the young, angry Anthony Burgess who wrote The Wanting Seed (which is even more savage than A Clockwork Orange), having grown up in post-Soviet Serbia, and you can imagine him writing this novel, even if you can't imagine Spasojevic filming it so faithfully. (Spasojevic wrote the script himself along with Aleksandar Radivojevic, wrtier of Tears for Sale and son of Misa Radivojevic, one of Serbia's best-known directors in the seventies and eighties.)<br /><br />I'm certainly not going to say that Spasojevic's envelope-pushing is not a draw here; for those who are naturally drawn to extreme films, A Serbian Film is the must-see movie of the last decade. All the hyperbole that's flown around about letdowns like Grotesque and A'linterieur flies here. I realize that anyone reading this a couple of years from now will wonder what the hell I'm talking about, because any pushed envelope never goes back to shape, but as of early 2011, you have never seen anything like this. Not just because of the subject matter, but because the porn bits are filmed by Spasojevic to hold almost no prurient interest whatsoever, save that first bit we see of Milosh the Horny Stud, which is typical crap-porn. (Another of Spasojevic's little bits of cold humor: that clip is the only part of the movie in which characters speak English, save Vukmir's description of the most disgusting scene in the film. Think on that.) But at the risk of the same proselytizing I often accuse artists of dabbling in unsuccessfully, I rush to add that unlike most extreme violence/torture porn/gornography/modern exploitation (in the classic sense of the term) movies, that is not all there is to this movie, by any means. That is a distinction that many critics missed, presumably because they heard all the same publicity the rest of us did, passed this off as yet another Hostel clone, and then watched it through that filter. Let me go back to Rosenbaum's Movie Wars (and if you can't tell, I haven't even finished it yet and it's already one of my favorite books of the year): to paraphrase, critics bring their own baggage to the table. (I apologize for paraphrasing, but I cannot for the life of me find the quote in question.) We all form opinions about a movie before we see it, and the lenses we view a movie through are colored by those opinions. This is not an unknown thing; I know dozens of fellow film buffs who refuse to read reviews of a movie before they see it in order to avoid just that sort of coloring. I'm hoping to go the other way here, obviously, and do what reviews are supposed to do: get you to see, or not see, a movie. It should be obvious by now that my aim is the former. And given the reactions of a number of critics, I'm going to tell you right up front that unless you already understand the conventions of exploitation film as it's done in the twenty-first century, you will probably despise this movie. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't see it, because Spasojevic's art here is no less valid than Balabanov's in Gruz 200. Or, to keep on with the Eastern European absurdist theme, Makavejev's WR: Mysteries of the Organism.<br /><br />As an aside, a point of clarification: while I drew a contrast, and it is a stark one, between Spasojevic's and Balabanov's films, I in no way meant to convey that Spasojevic's film is not in the same tradition of absurdity. The difference is in how that absurdity is conveyed. Balabanov works in the same lines as the absurdists of the twentieth century in that he straddles that line between laughing and crying by mostly staying on the comedy side of that line. But remember the old saw in question: sometimes you must laugh, because the only other option is to cry. Spasojevic simply embraces the other option, which is an equally valid, though rare, form of absurdist thinking. And he does it well enough that we can be reasonably certain he is just as aware of Pirandello, Calvino, Milorad Pavic (even more on point, as Pavic is Serbian as well), and that lot as Balabanov is. The end of the climax/beginning of the denouement will show you that in no uncertain terms, if you haven't already figured it out; it should be one of those moments of black humor I was talking about before, but instead it is Spasojevic's finest moment of absurdity-as-pathos, and it is stunningly--one might say absurdly--successful.<br /><br />But back to the point I was making previously in re: the art of the exploitation film, or the art of this particular exploitation film, since \\"art\\" and \\"exploitation\\" have been mutually exclusive terms for so long. The main problem is that this is a film bound to alienate its target audience, that being serious filmgoers, because Spasojevic is as steeped in exploitation film as he is in absuridsm, or even art film. A filmmaker like Balabanov, Gela Babulani (13 Tzameti), or Gyrogy Palfi (Taxidermia) understands that in order to keep an audience of serious art-film buffs in their seats, one has to make some concessions to the art-film crowd, even when one is making that rare beast, a non-cheap exploitation film. Balabanov, as I've said, does it with comedy, as does Palfi; Babulani went the action route, but steered as clear of the gore aspect of his subject matter as he could, preferring to concentrate on the psyche of his main character. Spasojevic is keenly aware of the psyche of his main character; in fact, the phantasmagoric, disjointed quality of much of the film's secondhalf is based entirely on Milos' own emotional state. (Stick with it during the confusing bits of that passage, which seem to make no sense timewise; it all becomes clear eventually.) But Spasojevic was entirely unwilling to make any concessions at all to the art-film crowd, even though this is a film made as much for them as it is for the gorehounds. And while this is not at all a film for beginners (at the very least, ease yourself into Eastern European exploitation flicks with some of those I've mentioned above, especially Gruz 200, Taxidermia, and WR), I think that once you have a handle on the filmic language that Spasojevic is speaking, a sort of odd Esperanto of Eli Roth and Sergei Paradjanov, you'll get a lot more of what he's saying than most critics who reviewed the movie did.<br /><br />I had originally given this movie three and a half stars (mostly to give myself the option of not integrating it into my list of the thousand best films of all time, which currently ends about halfway through the three-and-a-half star movies), but in the writing of this review/essay/polemic/whatever-it-is, I've realized Spasojevic deserves more than that, not only because this is as important a film in the envelope-pushing realm as were some other films I've given four stars to over the years (Saw, Behind the Green Door, etc.), but because, as a couple of reviews I've read have said, underneath the slick sheen of gorenography on the surface of A Serbian Film, there is, quite simply, a very well-made picture to be had. The acting by all and sundry is top-notch, the script is heartbreaking, and Spasojevic is a true directorial artist, just as much as Noe or Miike, and probably a couple of notches better than Roth. There is also a great deal to be said about the genius cinematography of Nemanja Jovanov, whose understanding of the effectiveness of chiaroscuro rivals David Lynch's, the editorial flair of Darko Simic, and the excellent score from Sky Wikluh, more inspiring because the last two of those are amateurs working on their first features, but I have already gone on far too long about this movie. I have written almost twenty-five hundred words on why you should see this movie; I could easily write another twenty-five hundred telling you why you should appreciate, if not enjoy, it. To call this an important film is probably understating the case, if anything, but it's important for what most serious critics would consider all the wrong reasons. All I can say to that is judge for yourself. This is as solid a piece of cinema as any I've seen this year, but like a number of other films in my top thousand, I may never watch it again. ****fully, I rush to add that unlike most extreme violence/torture porn/gornography/modern exploitation (in the classic sense of the term) movies, that is not all there is to this movie, by any means. That is a distinction that many critics missed, presumably because they heard all the same publicity the rest of us did, passed this off as yet another Hostel clone, and then watched it through that filter. Let me go back to Rosenbaum's Movie Wars (and if you can't tell, I haven't even finished it yet and it's already one of my favorite books of the year): to paraphrase, critics bring their own baggage to the table. (I apologize for paraphrasing, but I cannot for the life of me find the quote in question.) We all form opinions about a movie before we see it, and the lenses we view a movie through are colored by those opinions. This is not an unknown thing; I know dozens of fellow film buffs who refuse to read reviews of a movie before they see it in order to avoid just that sort of coloring. I'm hoping to go the other way here, obviously, and do what reviews are supposed to do: get you to see, or not see, a movie. It should be obvious by now that my aim is the former. And given the reactions of a number of critics, I'm going to tell you right up front that unless you already understand the conventions of exploitation film as it's done in the twenty-first century, you will probably despise this movie. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't see it, because Spasojevic's art here is no less valid than Balabanov's in Gruz 200. Or, to keep on with the Eastern European absurdist theme, Makavejev's WR: Mysteries of the Organism.     As an aside, a point of clarification: while I drew a contrast, and it is a stark one, between Spasojevic's and Balabanov's films, I in no way meant to convey that Spasojevic's film is not in the same tradition of absurdity. The difference is in how that absurdity is conveyed. Balabanov works in the same lines as the absurdists of the twentieth century inthat he straddles that line between laughing and crying by mostly staying on the comedy side of that line. But remember the old saw in question: sometimes you must laugh, because the only other option is to cry. Spasojevic simply embraces the other option, which is an equally valid, though rare, form of absurdist thinking. And he does it well enough that we can be reasonably certain he is just as aware of Pirandello, Calvino, Milorad Pavic (even more on point, as Pavic is Serbian as well), and that lot as Balabanov is. The end of the climax/beginning of the denouement will show you that in no uncertain terms, if you haven't already figured it out; it should be one of those moments of black humor I was talking about before, but instead it is Spasojevic's finest moment of absurdity-as-pathos, and it is stunningly--one might say absurdly--successful.    But back to the point I was making previously in re: the art of the exploitation film, or the art of this particular exploitation film, since \\"art\\" and \\"exploitation\\" have been mutually exclusive terms for so long. The main problem is that this is a film bound to alienate its target audience, that being serious filmgoers, because Spasojevic is as steeped in exploitation film as he is in absuridsm, or even art film. A filmmaker like Balabanov, Gela Babulani (13 Tzameti), or Gyrogy Palfi (Taxidermia) understands that in order to keep an audience of serious art-film buffs in their seats, one has to make some concessions to the art-film crowd, even when one is making that rare beast, a non-cheap exploitation film.

B003UESJH4|4.0|The King's Speech (Tom Hooper, 2010)<br /><br />You know, I saw this movie way back in January. I had planned to review it the next day, but then I got to thinking about it, and wanted to let it sit. I got avalanched with other stuff, and then it won Best Picture, and I said to myself \\"I'll review it tomorrow to take advantage of the Best picture thing.\\" And you know what? I'm writing this on March 15, 2011, and I haven't yet done anything with it yet. Whoops, missed THAT train. And the thing is, it's not because I'm trying to figure out how to soft-pedal a bad review (I liked it as much as the next guy) or anything like that; I just haven't, to this point, been able to find anything to say about it, really.<br /><br />I first encountered Hooper through a picture that, in some ways, is very similar to this one: Red Dust, a 2004 historical drama also based on a true story (and Hooper's \\"based on a true story\\" actually says what it means in both cases, which is praiseworthy). The story itself is very different, but Hooper's method of constructing a film around it is spot-on. Both films are imepccably-acted, very well crafted from a cinematography standpoint (and with gorgeous set pieces, utilizing cinematographers and DPs who play to the strengths of the settings, rural South Africa for Red Dust and urban London for The King's Speech), expertly-paced, and left me feeling good about the world when I finished watching them.<br /><br />But you know what? A month after seeing Red Dust, I didn't remember a great deal about it. I had certainly forgotten Hooper directed it until I looked him up on IMDB. And here we are a couple of months after The King's Speech, and I remember a bit more. Oddly, that has less to do with either Colin Firth (very good performance, of course, but he's always that good) or Helena Bonham-Carter (was she really even in the movie enough to land a Best Supporting nom?  I grant you, one could say the same about Beatrice Straight in Network, but I will remember Straight's eight minutes long after Bonham-Carter's turn here has faded from my memory; she was much better in Fight Club, for example), but Geoffrey Rush. Unlike either Firth or Bonham-Carter, Rush is a very inconsistent chap, who makes both good and bad movie choices and turns in good and bad performances, and the two have no direct connection (excellent in Quills, the only thing worth watching in Intolerable Cruelty, and what the hell were you thinking appearing in The House on Haunted Hill at all?). So when everything really comes together for Mr. Rush, I sit up and take notice. Other favorites of mine pop up (the underutilized Timothy Spall, Guy Pearce, Anthony Andrews, a host of others) as well, but I'd half-forgotten they were there at all.<br /><br />Thus the danger of writing a movie review right after seeing the movie, something I occasionally do (but I usually let them stew for anywhere from a couple of weeks to almost a year); how you feel right after walking out of the theater and how you feel a week or a month later about the same film could very well be entirely different things. Think of it, oversimplifying things, as the difference between short-term and long-term memory; what you remember about a movie a month after you've seen it may well be very different than what you remember about it five minutes after the movie is over. I recently saw Night of the Creeps, one of the eighties' best horror-comedies, on the big screen for the first time in a quarter-century. We all cheered at bits we (probably, anyway, hard to remember that far back) didn't cheer at the first time, simply because what drew us to the film in the first place--its spoofing on The Blob, not to mention its skewering of fraternity and sorority life--took second place in our minds over the years to the cleverness of the script, the freshness of the acting, the excellent comic timing. (The entire audience called out the \\"Detective... thrill me.\\" line at the end. The entire audience.)<br /><br />All of which is just a rather long-winded way of saying that reviewing this two months later I'm remembering much different things about the movie than I would have been calling out the morning after, save Rush's performance, passed over for an Oscar, in my opinion, because compared to many of the film's other performances it's positively subtle. (One can never say such a thing about Christian Bale, who actually won the statue, or a number of the other actors in the film. Michael Gambon wielded quite the heavy hand here, though one assumes that was intentional, as did Derek Jacobi, Spall [whose Churchill caricature was almost as heavy as Meryl Streep's of Julia Child last year], and, oddly, Guy Pearce, who seemed coated in honey for most of the film.) I rush to add I'm not saying anyone here did a bad job; all the performances contributed a great deal to the overall comic feel, which is quite a relief in a Royal Family biopic, and I wouldn't have traded that for the world. The occasional sour note was almost certainly by design; how else to explain Eve Best's almost lizard-like Wallis Simpson, a woman the Brits still loathe all these years later, while Americans write romantic doorstop-sized biographies of her? (My mother collected them.)<br /><br />I'm sure you've noticed I've concentrated on the acting here, rather than going into the usual stuff I go into, and that's because it's rare that I see a film with such a hefty stable of actors that you can conceivably place Derek Jacobi seventh in a cast list and get away with it. Tom Hooper was certainly up to the task, despite every other major award he's been nominated for over the years having come from his TV work (mostly the John Adams miniseries and Prime Suspect 6, and one wonders idly if the latter occurred only because he managed to pull the fat of a once-brilliant series out of the fires that were the fourth and fifth installments); he's finally got his head around filmwork being different than television work, one of the things that bugged me about Red Dust back in the day. Hiring Danny Cohen as DP was a brilliant move indeed; I imagine Royal-watchers who knew the name were shocked. Remember that gritty-London thing I was talking about? Cohen has been DP on such excellent, and overlooked, lower-class Londond pics as Dead Man's Shoes and This Is England, which are about as far from the highbrow Royal biopic as one can get without going to Australia. One of the things that still strikes me about the film two months later is the griminess of the street where Lionel Logue keeps his offices. Back in the day, we all praised Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 for having the bits set in a makeshift hospital actually look dirty, which so few movies at the time refused to do. It's getting more common these days, but you still don't expect muck in a big-budget studio production when it's not really germane to the plot. Danny Cohen is rapidly becoming my favorite DP who didn't come from Australia.<br /><br />Good god, there's so much to write about this movie. I didn't know where to begin, which was a good part of my not starting this for so long, and now I've no idea where to stop. There are reams to be written on some of the other technical details (the sound is exquisite, and deserved just as much recognition for its subtle retro touches as did the costuming, but for some reason the press focused on the costuming Oscar nom and ignored the sound mixing Oscar nom). One could easily write as many column inches about Guy Pearce's performance as have been written about Colin Firth's. Timothy Spall continues to be ignored in the press, despite having quietly amassed a resume as deep as it is broad, both in huge productions (the Harry Potter franchise) and minuscule ones (my favorite performance of his is still as the investigator in The Wisdom of Crocodiles). Seidler's perfect script, certainly the best one he's turned in since Tucker twenty-two years previous. And yet despitethere being all this to write about it, still, two months later, it doesn't feel as weighty, or as \\"important\\" if you will (as much as I loathe the term in this context) as Black Swan, which I saw the week previous and remember far more of, or some of the groundbreaking Oskar Fischinger shorts I had a chance to see the weekend previously. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film a great deal, but I'm wondering if, twenty-five years from now, we'll be looking at The King's Speech as one of the stronger Best Picture winners or one of the weaker ones. (This is not an idle question. Out of Africa won Best Picture twenty-five years previously. Has anyone watched it in the last twenty?) *** 1/2ugged me about Red Dust back in the day.

0765326353|5.0|Despite the length of the Way of Kings, as you approach the end you will no doubt begin to dread the fact that the ride is almost over.  The main characters are all noble people with unique sets of problems and ways of handling conflict.  They have flaws...though not big, unjustified ones.  One of the things I loved about the Mistborn series was characters that I started out hating, later turned into characters I loved, understood, and pitied.  In the Way of Kings I found very few surprises when it came to character development.  This is not to say that character development was not fantastic!  I loved the evolution of Dalinar, and the see-saw of Kaladin's emotions as he struggled to come to terms with his father's words.  I loved the disillusionment of Shallan, her struggle to find morality in her actions without excusing them, and her childish lack of consideration for consequences.  The characters were so engaging that it was easy to slip from point of view to the other without getting lost, or forgetting each character's circumstances.  I must note that normally I have a favorite and don't like having to lose the thread of their story with a point of view change--this was definitely not the case in the Way of Kings (though I am partial to Kaladin).<br /><br />The world that Sanderson has created is detailed and rich, without being over described.  In fact, when it came to the Shin I found it under described!  I wanted to know much, much more about the Shin and their farmer worshipping culture, and tradition of Truthless assassins!  The world of WoK is separated into strict gender roles, but the division of those roles was unique and quite interesting.  I loved that since women do all the reading and writing, there are footnotes that are kept secret and can belay the fiction that men requested be recorded.

Spain was taken over by a ruthless dictator and the people joined together in a collective society and fought back.  However, the governments of all other western nations funded the dictator, Franco, for fear their people would also join together, overthrow their bosses, and live collectively. The USSR chose another route, though, they tried to infiltrate the collective rebels and claim unity with them but only destroyed them from within.
1594202842|5.0|I found the book inspiring and refreshing. I don't think mastering a musical instrument should be my kids' first priority, and that Amy Chua is wrong to discount how important social skills and an understanding of group dynamics (aka playdates and sleepovers) are. But it was so empowering and important for me to hear someone say that my job as a parent isn't to be liked, but to withstand a lot of griping and crying to prepare your kid for the world.     My 3rd-grade daughter was falling behind in math, and every time I sat down with her to try to help she pitched a fit, complained, faked dumb and talked baby talk not to have to apply herself, etc. My husband & I were starting to wonder if she really was learning disabled and perhaps better off in a special school of special people where they would teach her in some special way. I read this book right before spring break and it changed my attitude immediately, from something along the lines of \\"perhaps the school's methods just don't work for her\\" (pour a glass of wine, go to yoga) to \\"she's a child, she doesn't know what's best for her, complaining is what kids do, but my job is to not give up on her and I am tough enough to take it.\\" (I had do-what-you-feel hippie parents, so this attitude was/is still a little new to me). I told my daughter that we were going to work on math three hours a day  at the least, more if she wasted time, with extra chores for complaints or excuses. And darned if Amy Chua wasn't right, here it is Tuesday of spring break, and the daughter has mastered long division, we're moving into double digits and dividing fractions, and she is so proud of herself. She's been calling everyone she knows to crow about how she solved a 14-digit problem with no help. It is real, genuine self-esteem, and on my part, real pride, not just platitudes. You probably won't agree with everything in her book, but don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.
1439102724|4.0|I believe this was a much better novel than some of her past reads.  It was gripping and certainly kept your attention.  However, I found some of the subject matter hard to swallow.  Could a woman who was NEVER a homosexual suddenly become one at age 40?  I just don't know. What about the theory that you are born that way?  Could you grow up heterosexual, never think about being with a woman, be married for 9 years and then convert to be a lesbian?  I'm not sure.  I don't have any research into the subject but it just seems odd.  Notwithstanding, the rest of book was gripping. It did remind me of \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" in the way it was written.  I like Jodi's writing and this one did not disappoint me at all.  I always find her novels to be a good read, some better than others.  I believe this was one that was better.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This is one of the best start to finish albums to come along in a very long time.  start to finish, the music tells tales of lust, and love, and loss with beautiful honesty and surprising restraint when the moment calls from it all in a bluegrassy, folky sort of voice that speaks directly to our more nostalgic selves.

B004G600A4|5.0|Disney's long tradition of musical animation never dies. Once again the company's latest work \\"Tangled\\" proves that. This is a family picture everyone can enjoy, telling a good story about characters you relate to, with a healthy dose of action and comedy. But what is most impressive is the film's breathtakingly beautiful colors that saturate the animation's fairy tale world.    Based on a tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, \\"Tangled\\" revolves around a 18-year-old girl Rapunzel living in a high tower among the woods. In fact, she was kidnapped as a baby from the king and the queen by Gothel, an elderly woman who knows the special power Princess Rapunzel possesses. Not knowing the world outside (and her true identity), Rapunzel dreams of traveling to see thousands of lights that float in the sky once a year.     \\"Tangled\\" mixes the orthodox \\"boy-meets-girl\\" theme with fairy tale elements (though any sexual allusions of the original tale are carefully removed). The film keeps a steady pace with musical sequences, action scenes and nice comic turns from fearsome-looking (but actually likable) thugs drinking at a tavern, plus one non-speaking animal, Pascal the chameleon. Also, Maximus, a white horse of the royal guard, is a real scene stealer, who deserves his own movie.    But what makes \\"Tangled\\" really special is its rich colors and lush textures. The amazing sky lantern scene is one of the many highlights of the film. This alone would be enough to give the film four stars or even more.
B003Y5H54W|2.0|Let me get this out of the way: I'm mid-30's, married, and watch the Twilight movies as a guilty pleasure even though they are tragically reduced from the books.  So Red Riding Hood, having the same director as the original Twilight movie, looked to have potential for similar entertainment.  I was wrong.  This movie is outright hokey and awkward.  The characters walk around a lot with no purpose, and the dialogue was embarrassing to watch at times.  The actors (aside from Amanda Seyfried) seemed very uncomfortable and disjointed from their roles - like people trying to present something they didn't study enough - no confidence and not convincing at all.  It felt very watered down.    I wanted to like it and kept trying, but the story line was weak and the special effects were bad (like 1980's bad).  The only good part was that the identity of the werewolf remained a mystery and was not obvious at all.    This is such an imitation Twilight in so many ways - too bad it didn't work!  I know it's an alluring trailer and that you'll probably watch it anyway, but I bet a lot of you will be back to write your own similar, disappointed reviews.  As for taking another look... no thanks.  One time was enough.
B004N62KTG|1.0|Well, I have been buying Lady Gaga's CDs and have five of them in my collection. However, with the release of this song, I am done purchasing her music, especially anything with this song on it.    I definitely will not be giving her any money or support on this song. I will pray that she will repent and turn to God and use her talents for something positive. She has to understand that these kinds of songs will turn off a significant portion of her audience (no matter how successful this song is).    As should be completely obvious, the message in her song is directly supportive of sin, LGBT support and that is not appropriate and I don't want my children exposed to such rhetoric. The concept presented of being \\"born this way\\" is not based on reality as those types of sinful behavior are lifestyle choices and not genetic in nature.     The rest of you can disagree all you want to, but God's Word does not change.    The song itself is catchy, sure, but it sounds too much like Madonna.    Cheers

4770031246|5.0|I have never done bento before. When I decided to find a way to eat healthier lunches and stop buying the sodium-packed and carb-crammed \\"Healthy Choice\\" packs, I stumbled upon the concept of a bento box. I already loved Japanese culture as a whole; the people, traditions, history, everything! I even have several anime I adore. When I started reading up on what a bento was, I knew it was for me. I realized I probably couldn't just whip up a bunch of stir-fry and shove it in a Gladware, so I splurged on a real bento box, rice molds, sauce squeezers, and this book.<br /><br />I was absolutely blown away at how much information is in this book and the ease of its use. It gives step by step instructions on not only how to prepare the bento-specific meals, but how to pack the box itself, along with tons of other helpful info. I was worried that I wouldn't have time in the mornings to cook the food and have it fresh the same day, but the timelines are a huge help.<br /><br />There are countless tips, tricks, and hints throughout the book to make bento fun, easy, and healthy. The author even has website addresses in the back linking to their website with even more information, including a bento meal planner (HUGE help).<br /><br />Overall, definitely the book to buy for the bento beginner!
0061122416|3.0|The characters come alive in Coelho's \\"The Alchemist\\" and readers will enjoy the adventure. It has a light touch of fantasy that will catch the hearts of all without overwhelming those who are unfamiliar with speculative fiction. Yet at times the book is more preachy than it is \\"self-help,\\" which is the vein it taps throughout the book. The novel is short and has powerful wording.
B002HR1W1K|5.0|Okay, I ddin't actually pee my pants, but I almost did.     This is the funniest movie I have seen in years! I know I was missing a lot of the inside jokes because I don't watch a lot of cop movies (haven't ever seen Bad Boys 2, been years since I saw Point Break) and even though I watch a ton of british comedies, I know some of that stuff still eluded me due to language differences. But even with all that, I was laughing nearly the entire way through.    The editing for this movie is insanely good. Simon's movies always have the best transitions, something I think that transfered over from his Spaced days. (MINOR SPOILERS) For example, the part where the cloaked murderer beats the guy in the face with a baton transitions smoothly into Sgt. Angel falling into his chair to watch the movie. So genious! these little things are what make a good movie into a great one. It's that attention to detail in every part of this movie that shows the love the creators have in their work. When someone loves what they are creating this much, then the audience is bound to as well.    Characters are vivid and memorable, but there are just too many to keep them all straight with one viewing. Good excuse for me to watch this over and over. Awesome performances by all, esp. Timothy Dalton, Nick and Simon.    This movie is kind of a comedy/action/slasher hybrid. It does a fairly good job of balancing all these elements, though comedy seems to be the thread that ties them all together. There isn't much action for the first part of the movie, just comedy. Then the slasher mystery starts, and then the action. At first, I was really put off by the switch in tone from light comedy to slasher movie, as there wasn't much setup for this in the beginning. This is really the only thing I can find wrong with the movie. The good news is they do a good job of establishing the slasher portion and the disorientation from the switch in tone (a problem they also had with Shaun) wears off. The movie closeswith perhaps the best and most satisfying ending to any action movie I have ever seen. I was fist-pumping with joy and shouts of \\"yes!\\" the entire time (hangs head in embarrasment). It has everything! A big scooby-doo reveal, a reversal, massive gun battle (think John Woo), a car chase, a hand-to-hand fight, and an \\"explosive\\" finale. If at any point you were unconvinced that they weren't taking themselves seriously, the ending will safely do away with that notion, heh hehh.    Pegg throws in every cop movie cliche and then some, plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor, campy action sequences, and brilliantly cheesy one-liners. I really can't say how freaking awesome this movie is, it is just something you will have to experience for yourself. I liked it so much I just bought it on blu ray, minutes after watching a copy I checked out from the library. I never do that, so that says a lot.    If you don't like this movie, I will hit you with a shovel.
B003N6DB2C|4.0|C'mon, it seems like anyone can be a singer in a band these days.  The music is good, but the singer is so unmemorable I am pretty sure I will pull out this CD in a few years and spin it again just to remember what they sound like.<br /><br />However, I like the energy of the band, it prompted me to throw on a fk*n great album by an entirely underrated hard rock band called the Giraffes.  Not the artsy-fartsy one from Seattle, but the balls-out rocking one from NY.  Get the self-titled Giraffes album and you will see exactly what this Norwegian outfit is lacking.<br /><br />Four stars, begrudgingly, because I think singers and songwriters are not appreciated anymore, and this album probably will appeal to the undiscriminating masses; I'd hate to cramp their style.
1439107955|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read!  It was a gripping tale of a disease that has impacted lives for thousands of years.  Dr. Mukherjee is not only a compassionate and caring participant in healing patients; he synthesises a vast amount of complex information and renders it compelling and understandable in the form of a great story.  When it's over one has learned so many valuable things about how research, medicine and the forces that shape them have developed over the past 150 years with the outcome of how patients are cared for and drugs that are (or are not) brought to market today.  You will wish that every physician and research scientist could have the heart and mind of Dr. Mukherjee.  I highly recommend it.
B0040QYROK|4.0|Too much has already been written about the film and the found footage restoration so let me just add some general observations (based on the 2010 Blu ray release):    --This is hardly the definitive \\"restoration\\".  Methods exist for cleaning up those scratchy found scenes to perfection, It's already been done on many other films including the Beatle's \\"Help!\\", so we know it's possible.  When the money is available, this film will be fully realized;    --I consider it an error of aesthetical judgement not to have used the original text font for the \\"missing\\" scene descriptions, but it doesn't detract from enjoying the film;    --The included orchestral track is magnificent, don't believe for a minute that you won't enjoy it without purchasing the \\"Alloy Orchestra\\" version.

B002NUZ93S|5.0|Back then when Porcupine Tree was just a pseudonym for a one-man act, Steven Wilson composed (with a little help from friends Colin Edwin and Richard Barbieri who would later be part of the band) and put out a record consisting of (almost) 10 brilliant psychedelic tracks. Since it was a one-man act, the drumming was programmed for one thing.    Come 2005, Wilson partially re-recorded, fully remixed and remastered the album with Gavin Harrison's drumming replacing the electronic drumming, added a CD-2 which is \\"Staircase Infinities\\", a remastered version of the EP of rare psychedelic tracks from the same era and put out a Double-disk \\"Up the Downstair\\" a now complete and accomplished 2-CD set which could easily qualify to be one of Porcupine Tree's greatest albums!    Check out the masterful compositions on the album as a whole and be prepared to be mesmerized by Wilson's early musical genius. In the era of \\"The Incident\\" I don't think there is any going back to this style now, but if Wilson ever attempts anything like this again, I would certainly welcome it with open arms!
1427210497|5.0|You can read hundreds of reviews of Franzen's FREEDOM, but as an audio book enthusiast, I've decided to review the actual audio book reader, David LeDoux. While Franzen's book seems to be either a \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" work, David LeDoux deserves great credit for bringing this literary work to life in the unabridged audio version.    LeDoux's voice just seems to fit the story - modern, light, serious, determined. Since the book covers an enormous cast of characters, LeDoux must enbody the same -- and he does that with seamlessness and creativity. Subtle voice fluctuations, rather than blatant different voices, make this audio book easy to listen to and easy to differentiate one character from another. One of my pet peeves in audio books is listening to a masculine reader try and \\"sound\\" like a female -- it's like fingernails on a chalkboard at times. But LeDoux drops in and out of the female character with ease and without losing a sense of himself through all.    This is a LONG audio book - 19 CD's. So if you don't like the reader, nevermind if you like the story itself, you won't make it through and will waste a lot of money. But LeDoux is the perfect reader for this story. Love or hate the story, I doubt many will find anything negative to say about David LeDoux's reading of same.
B004LGPBZI|3.0|I didn't really have a lot of expectations about this album at all but I was expecting that the band members and Liam himself would come up with a record of their own in a way that I would really love. Well, unfortunely this is not the case with Beady eye's debut album. Everybody has said here that this is not an Oasis album and they're absolutely right but still you can see that these people (including Liam Gallagher) can't sound interesting without Noel Gallagher playing with them. Don't get me wrong... I'm not saying these people are lacked of talent but it's just that they do not seem to pull anything interesting here in ANY of the songs. Most of them sound like a tribute to the 60's rock'n'roll music and YES!!! The Beatles influence is WAY too obvious in many of the tracks here either when they're playing a song or when Liam is trying to sing words that remind us to John Lennon's best days in his songwriting skills (not that he achieves such task because he doesn't).<br /><br />I'll be perfectly honest with you. If Liam Gallagher is expecting to get famous and huge with this kind of music he can start forgetting about the whole thing right now because at least this album is not getting anywhere in a couple of months from now. It is not strong enough to stand on their own once the whole \\"these guys used to be Oasis\\" thing vanishes. In my humble opinion they know how to rock their instruments and Liam knows how to sing his tunes but without Noel Gallagher they have lost the right direction to make timeless music.

B002ZG99N6|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />'The Town' refers to 'Charlestown', once a predominantly Irish-Catholic section of Boston known for criminal activity. Crime apparently reached its apotheosis around 1995 in Charlestown when a series of bank robberies were committed. In more recent times, however, the area has become gentrified and probably most of its residents now would express surprise that Charlestown is currently associated with the serious type of crimes depicted in this film. Nonetheless, the filmmakers advise their audience in the trailer that \\"there are over 300 bank robberies in Boston every year\\" and \\"most of these professionals live in a 1-square-mile neighborhood called Charlestown.\\" According to Wikipedia, however, there were 23 reported bank robberies in the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the first quarter of 2010. So much for verisimilitude!<br /><br />'The Town' works best when depicting the dark underside of the criminal underclass in Charlestown (albeit, a depiction that is decidedly anachronistic, as discussed above). My favorite character is 'Fergie', played by the late character actor, Pete Postlethwaite. He's a local crime boss who runs a floral shop as a front for his criminal activities. In perhaps the best scene in the film, Fergie confronts Ben Afleck's 'Doug MacRay', insisting that MacRay participate in the next bank robbery he's got planned, despite the fact that MacRay now wants out. MacRay is practically left speechless when Fergie reveals that years ago, he got MacRay's mother hooked on drugs in retaliation for his father wanting to leave Fergie's gang. The kicker is that the mother committed suicide. Fergie ups the stakes (like all good criminals) when he threatens to kill MacRay's girlfriend, Claire, the sweet bank manager turned hostage. Postlethwaite is perfect as the scraggy-faced long-time tough guy who'll stop at nothing to protect his turf.<br /><br />There are a few other good things about 'The Town' including the excellent performance of Jeremy Renner as 'Jem', Doug's boyhood friend, who's now Doug's right hand man. Renner is utterly believable as the hot-headed psycho who always wants to take things a step further than Doug, his level-headed comrade in crime. There are also a collection of local Boston characters in the form of armored car guards, police officers and Fenway Park workers, who all show up, adding to the foreboding atmosphere. Blake Lively also acquits herself well as the McRay's jealous ex-girlfriend who can't accept the fact that she's the odd woman out. Should I also mention the first two bank robberies are neatly shot and edited and add to the overall fast pace of the film's narrative?<br /><br />Unfortunately, a good deal of the rest of 'The Town' is typical Hollywood claptrap, which disqualifies it from being in the same league as that old chestnut, the gritty 1970 crime drama shot in the Boston area, 'The Friends of Eddie Coyle'. At the outset, it doesn't make a lot of sense that Jem decides to take Claire hostage as it soon becomes apparent that she lives in the neighborhood and could perhaps identify one (or all of them) as the perpetrators of the bank robbery.<br /><br />The hostage 'faux pas' is a necessary contrivance in order to allow Doug to hook up with Claire. Many have criticized Affleck's performance, arguing that he seems out of place as a local boy from Charlestown. Maybe so, but Affleck is really saddled by a script that calls for a character working at complete cross purposes. The screenwriters want us to believe that McCray is on one hand, a bit of a psychopath who doesn't hesitate to join his pals in committing bank robberies where people are killed (although McCray insists he never does any killing himself). But when his chivalrous heart is offended after girlfriend Claire informs him some local bully has been harassing her, he has no qualms in breaking into the apartment of the bully in question and beating this guy (along with psycho buddy Jem), to a bloody pulp. As long as he's doing it for 'a good woman', McCray's violent outbursts are 'justified'.<br /><br />Rebecca Hall is equally saddled by the film's unconvincing script. In one of the worst scenes in the film, when Jem intrudes on Doug and Claire's luncheon date, no bells and whistles go off in Claire's mind after she meets him. It's quite obvious that Jem is not only from 'the other side of the tracks' but is also thoroughly unsavory, and Claire ends up saying nothing to Doug afterward about him. You would think that that it might occur to good girl Claire that Doug's 'buddy' also puts her new boyfriend in a bad light too. The films' scenarists also lose points when they have Claire and the FBI agents standing at an open window where Doug can easily see that they're forcing her to entice him to her apartment. Hey, how about standing inside the living room, away from the window, where Doug can't draw any definitive conclusions as to whether the FBI is at the apartment or not.<br /><br />'The Town' wears out its welcome completely in the final (third) bank robbery scene. While the first bank robbery was quick and for the most part fairly believable and the second one featured some comic relief with the gang dressed in Nun masks, the third heist appears to be simply derivative. Doug and Jem simply dress up as cops and rob the payroll room at Fenway Park. There is the obligatory shootout, with Jem doing his 'suicide-by-cop' routine. Meanwhile, Special Agent Frawley, stares mindlessly, as Doug makes his getaway in a cop car, right in front of his eyes. In a nod to the 'Shawshank Redemption', all's well that ends well when Claire digs up the stolen cash in her garden and donates it for the renovation of a local kids' hockey rink.<br /><br />There you have it. 'The Town' manages to entertain in some respects but ultimately must resort to the tired trappings of the heist genre. It's a mixed bag that should at best, engender mixed reviews!dy pulp.

1594202842|3.0|\\"Okay for entertainment, dismal for parenting.\\"<br /><br />\\"What Ms. Chua provided with her `Battle Hymn' is a startling and sad example of parents who gave their children every material, genetic, and educational advantage, but still left their children woefully emotionally needy.\\"<br /><br />\\"Chua's `Battle Hymn' is either a source of deep pride or utter embarrassment to Chinese-Americans.\\"<br /><br />\\"Chua's `Battle Hymn' best serves as a significant, thought-provoking case study, one that serves as a warning to all parents that any form of extreme parenting, Chinese or Western, is not the answer.\\"<br /><br />This is just a handful of some of the reactions to Yale law professor Amy Chua's parenting memoir \\"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother\\", and most of them have rarely been tame, roaring their condemnation like the powerful cat of its title.  Chua is a love-her-or-hate-her kind of woman; the same school of thought is applicable to her memoir.  It is well-written as far as memoirs go - coherent and to-the-point, the reader rarely gets the wrong idea about her and her motives, her self-described \\"can-do\\" attitude presiding over everything she does.  Failure is not an option for this woman; she has so much grit and determination that it's almost contagious, and may even manage to \\"inject Chinese iron into a Nerf Western spine\\", as author Ayelet Waldman so humorously put it.  However, most who partake will find that it brews a murky and toxic reaction within them, Chua the wicked witch stirring the emotional cauldron.  It takes a brave woman to risk widespread hatred.<br /><br />At only 229 pages, \\"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mom\\" is a quick read made quicker by one's outrage at the author's conduct towards her daughters (a chapter entitled \\"The Birthday Card\\" was my jaw-dropping moment, one that made me cross over from feeling moderately critical of her to flat-out despising her). She insisted that her children learn Mandarin Chinese (for what reason, I'm not sure), be the #1 student in every subject except gym and drama, and play classical instruments (piano, violin), practicing them for hours on end (even on family vacations and during illness - she ushered her younger daughter off to an audition at Juilliard after a 24-hour bout of severe food poisoning), all the while hovering over them and nitpicking/haranguing them as they did so.  She frequently criticized/insulted them, threatened to give away or destroy toys, and eventually became so overbearing that her younger daughter Lulu exploded with rage at her one day, saying she hated her, that she was a terrible mother and that \\"you just make me feel bad about myself every second.  You've wrecked my life.\\"<br /><br />Chua and her book have a Howard Stern effect: the reader begins to loathe her but continues on with the book despite it, unconsciously engrossed in the material because they want to see what outrageous thing she does next.  Chua is overly confident and selfish with a will that refuses to be contested, so controlling and self-congratulatory that it can make the reader ill with incredulity.  \\"Brag Hymn of the Tyrant Mother\\" would've been a more appropriate title.<br /><br />Her wandering subtitle (if it could be called that) claims, \\"This is a story about a mother, two daughters, and two dogs.  This was supposed to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones.  But instead, it's about a bitter clash of cultures, a fleeting taste of glory, and how I was humbled by a thirteen-year old.\\"  Parents of all ethnicities and backgrounds whose drive and personality matches Amy's will see her as a model parent; those who prefer to take a gentler and kinder approach based on cultivation of free thought and self-esteem will view her with a bulging eye of disapproval.  To describe what she does as \\"parenting\\" is laughable; \\"subjugation\\" seems a better fit, Chua every bit the autocrat in her home and doling out obedience training as if there were little difference between her children and her dogs (perhaps that's one of the reasons she included her Samoyeds in this tale, showing the reader that you can dominate neither dog nor human being - they both have wills of their own).<br /><br />My natural reaction to all her pomposity is to pick apart her rhetoric; there's a particular passage at the end of Part I (pg. 62, chapter \\"The Little White Donkey\\") that becomes more and more maddening with each sentence:<br /><br />Amy says: \\"There are all these new books out there portraying Asian mothers as scheming, callous, overdriven people indifferent to their kids' true interests.\\"<br /><br />My response: What books are those, besides this one (she just might be a pioneer for that)?  Chua does not offer even one title of these supposed books that seek to paint the Chinese as ruthless, not even in her pithy index.<br /><br />Amy says: \\"For their part, many Chinese secretly believe that they care more about their children and are willing to sacrifice much more for them than Westerners, who seem perfectly content to let their children turn out badly.\\"<br /><br />My response: Some source quotes from the \\"many Chinese\\" would've been nice, as well as the Western parents who don't care about their kids.  Someone needs to tell Chua that her confident assumptions aren't hard evidence.<br /><br />Amy says: \\"Western parents try to respect their children's individuality, encouraging them to pursue their true passions, supporting their choices, and providing positive reinforcement and a nurturing environment.  By contrast, the Chinese believe that the best way to protect their children is by preparing them for the future, letting them see what they're capable of, and arming them with skills, work habits, and inner confidence that no one can ever take away.\\"<br /><br />My response: She provided no argument as to why the Western parent's method fails to produce successful children that grow into successful adults.<br /><br />Then there's this tripe from pg. 101 which has no research whatsoever to support it: \\"When I look around at all the Western families that fall apart - all the grown sons and daughters who can't stand to be around their parents or don't even talk to them - I have a hard time believing that Western parenting does a better job with happiness.  It's amazing how many older Western parents I've met who've said, shaking their heads sadly, `As a parent you just can't win.  No matter what you do, your kids will grow up resenting you.'  By contrast, I can't tell you how many Asian kids I've met who, while acknowledging how oppressively strict and brutally demanding their parents were, happily describe themselves as devoted to their parents and unbelievably grateful to them, seemingly without a trace of bitterness or resentment.\\"<br /><br />Again, no quotes from all these people she's allegedly met, nor any research from some reputable family counselors and/or psychologists/psychiatrists to support it.  In the interest of impartiality, I wonder whether Chua made these oh-so poignant observations on families who were below her social and financial stratum and whether she knew the exact circumstances as to why those families fell apart or stayed together.  She should've known that her frequent generalizations between two cultures that were unsupported by statistics would be subject to dissection and criticism.  Then again, Chua knows that Western culture loves sensationalism and that her theorizing paired by her air of superiority and her monstrous mothering would be her unfailing selling points.<br /><br />Bottom line: As you can see, it's hard not to get incensed and insulted when reading \\"Battle Hymn...\\" - Chua rarely has anything good to say about Western parents or their methods (I don't even remember her extending credit to her husband Jed for being a good father) and can tend to make the lot of us feel like hacks and/or underachievers when it comes to extracting the best from ourchildren.  Perhaps she does it in the hopes that we'll be so slighted that it will inspire us to be better, that it will have the same effect on us in striving for excellence as she claims it has on children of Chinese parents.  Whatever the intended result, it will certainly make those Western parents who are plagued by issues of self-esteem wonder whether they could've been a better shepherd when guiding their own flock.the Western families that fall apart - all the grown sons and daughters who can't stand to be around their parents or don't even talk to them - I have a hard time believing that Western parenting does a better job with happiness.

This movie is amazing and I have loaned it to many friends and watched it over again myself.  I heard an interview of Ruckerberg where he says he still has the same girlfriend he has had since years before this all started.  Only point of objection from him.
0131177052|5.0|One of the best books about design, testing, pragmatism, and overall programming.  I wish I had come across it sooner. I bought it after reading through Test Driven by Lasse Koskela where he gave this book praise.  Test Driven is also a very good book and I recommend it as well as Working Effectively with Legacy Code.  A programming canon for sure.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|This was an awesome soundtrack with 3 of the best musicians there are.  I had someone give it to me to watch and loved it, so I bought it myself for my boyfriend who is a bass player in a band. Watching it was an inspiration, the music was great and the interviews with each of them was something you won't see anywhere else. It's a classic and a must buy for everyone!!! I don't know who I enjoyed the most, Jimmy Page or Jack White......

B004APVI1G|5.0|This movie in 3d was simply beautiful.  The clarity, the quality was amazing.  Purchased for my granddaughters, they really enjoyed the story line.  The 8 year old has seen it 3 times.  Am so very glad I bought it.
B002AOWXQ8|4.0|Positive simplistic music which achieves a melancholy mix of bittersweet sentiment without resorting to cheesy-ness. The best parts are the the interaction between the male and female singers, creating an intimate yet playful tone. A fun yet deep album. Should be a good live show at Electric Forest 2011!
B00475BUVM|4.0|Like i say Loved the movie but the 3D was basicaly non existent. Save yourself some money and buy the regular Blu-Ray version then watch it in 2D-3D mode on your tv.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Even though I saw Sicko in a theater when it was first out, I bought a copy of the DVD to see again and to share with others. I really need to buy dozens and hand them out. Moore tries to inject a little humor, especially at the end, but the situation this movie illustrates is far from funny.
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|First off the 3D wasn't that great my wife and I watched this on a Samsung UN55C8000 and other 3D movies have been amazing. What both my wife and i found very annoying was the constant drivel about the now defunct Global warming.  Now i am a believer in recycling actually i threw this DVD in the recycle bin this morning.
B0041KKYD8|5.0|I wrote a review for the original and I state that the original is the best, but this remake does the original justice.  What made the original a classic was how far they would go in the story telling process in order for you to feel for the characters.  This one even takes it farther.  Sarah Butler plays the lead character and she brings new life into such a classic story.  Sarah was a great choice for this role, because she can play the sweet girl (sexy), victim, and then executioner (sexy).  I still recommend watching the original, but I would say give this remake a try.  The idea is the same, but the way they tell the story is not.  In some aspects it makes you feel like you are watching a whole new movie.

B004BLTNL6|5.0|This movie has held up over the years and it still is considered a classic.  Like most classics, it has been remade (2010) to try to reach out to a younger audience.  I am sure that once people see this remake that are going to want to watch the original and what better way to do that , then in 1080p blu ray format.  I have seen both the original and the remake and I can say that the original is still the best.  This is a must watch.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I had to wait a few days to write this because I had to sort through my emotions. At first I was a bit disappointed with the book, but now it makes sense. Yes, there were a few sensless things in the book, but overall, I am happy with it. I was satisfied with the ending, but there were parts that I did not like and felt that they could have been changed without affecting the story overall. With all that being said, I still think this is a wonderful series and I would recommend it to anyone!
B000PMG16U|1.0|Back in 1999, all of us fans tried so very hard to convince ourselves that Phantom Menace was good, and then did the same three years later with Attack of the Clones. Some actually managed this feat with the third prequel, Revenge of the Sith, telling themselves that it was \\"darker,\\" and thus, somehow \\"better.\\"    Do yourself a favor and watch the Red Letter Media reviews of Episodes I-III on YouTube. The video reviews are exponentially more entertaining than the films themselves.

0240815807|5.0|I've been mixing my own music for nearly 30 years now, when I got my first cassette four-track! I've read so many books and manuals on recording, mixing, mastering, etc. I subscribe to Sound On Sound, Tape Op, etc for several years. I have been posting on Gearslutz (music production forum) for a decade now...<br /><br />I feel like this one book could replace all that.<br /><br />Serious.<br /><br />Every page is packed with amazing tips and tricks. Which makes sense considering this the man behind Mix Rescue in SOS. He gets so many problems thrown at them and he solves them in very elegant, practical ways. He is a professional audio problem-solver! Quite often I'll listen to the before and after mixes at Mix Rescue and think the 'before' sounds perfectly acceptable. Then I'll hear Mike Senior's mix and he's elevated it to a love of professionalism that just sounds classy.<br /><br />I'm used to reading pretty dry manuals and reference books. This one is written in a very down-to-earth, readable style with a sense of humor as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who mixes professionally or casually.
1439102724|1.0|Let me begin by stating that I am a great fan of Jodi Picoult. I have read all of her previous books(most of them repeatedly). But I was so disappointed with this one. I thought the character development was weak, and the end was visible a mile away. I actually had a hard time even finishing this book.   I love that Ms. Picoult tackles difficult, and extremely time- sensitive issues, but I thought this book read like a rush job. Poor Plot, boring characters, and a weak ending.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|Red Riding Hood is a re-imagining of the fairy tale. The film is very atmospheric in creating a medieval village, and the sense of doom is palpable. The lead character, Valerie is in love with an orphaned woodcutter named Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) but it has been arranged that she will marry the far richer Henry (Max Irons) who is a blacksmith.  The only problem is that the village is terrorized by a werewolf and has been for more than a generation offering up a sacrifice when the moon is full. When the werewolf kills Valerie's sister, the village is galvanized into hunting down the creature.     Into this mix comes a werewolf hunter named Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) who is ruthless in his methods to find and destroy the werewolf.  There are limitless possibilities as to who the werewolf could be and Solomon becomes more of a curse to the village than the werewolf does.  The filmmakers created a great look for the village and the film was well cast. Gary Oldman is perfect as Solomon, and it is refreshing to see him play a villain again. Amanda Seyfried is nicely cast as the lead character as are her love interests.  Virginia Madsen was also excellent as Valerie's mother, who has her own dark secret. It was also good to see Julie Christie in a film as Valerie's somewhat sinister grandmother.     The movie teeters toward a B-movie romance (one wonders if Valerie will suddenly declare her love for Henry as he proves himself very noble-hearted) but the mystery and horror of the werewolf kept my interest in the story.  Although Red Riding Hood may seem like \\"Twilight for werewolves,\\" I liked the story and the overall feel of mystery. Red Riding Hood is a film that I would like to see again maybe only for the marvelous visual realization of the village, grandma's, lonely but cozy cottage and the over-the-top performance of Gary Oldman.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|i got this cause i love the more. the quality is okay but i guess it would look nicer on a 120hz tv
B0009UC810|1.0|Warning - I just received my copy of this DVD from Amazon and disappointed to find what appears to be a pirated DVD. The disk itself looks somewhat suspicious being almost completely blank (no printing), but really revealed itself when played. The video quality of some of the scenes is so bad you would think you were watching a 20 year old VHS tape. Some scenes are so grainy it looks like it's from a video taken inside the theatre. I have no idea who actually made this, but don't waste your money on it.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Glancing over these reviews I see that a few people think there are better versions of the novel.  Hard to imagine.  I thought the acting, the scenery, everything, was perfect.
030745455X|5.0|Excellent book... haven't finished it yet.  Just finished \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" and couldn't wait to start this one.  Hope to read \\"Hornet's Nest\\" next!
B002ZG98C8|1.0|I don't think I've ever been so sickened by a movie. This is politically correct garbage with the message that illegal immigration is wonderful, Mexicans are innocent victims, and Americans are monsters. I may, for the first time in my life, snap and step on this DVD.    And no, I am not a borderland redneck with no education, I am an incensed educated American with a master's degree who is sick to death of this white-browbeating trash.
1416550534|5.0|I found Kate Morton on amazon and she is a wonderful story teller! Her books are full of twists and turns and sometimes you as the reader can figure out one of the bigger secrets early on and you wait and watch when the character comes to the same realization as you! Its almost like watching your child figure something out for themselves!
B003RNXIBK|5.0|This album is personal, probably out of the pervious albums the most in depth album done by Eminem. His style is calmed down now, but this is not a negative. Rememeber back in 2003 when 50 Cent said, \\"Go head switch ya style up and if they hate, then let them hate and watch the money pile up.\\" This is exactly the case, artist at times will switch up their style and it can either make them or brake them. Cold Wind Blows, Not Afraid, Love The Way You Lie, Won't Back Down, No Love, On Fire, Cindarella Man, and Talkin' To Myself, from top to bottom this album is great! Looking forward to the next project.
B000Q66JXA|5.0|I love this movie. Fantastic soundtrack, and killer visuals/acting. What's not to like? It probably is the definitive Arthur epic. Most likely based on the Once and Future King version by TH White as it aligns pretty closely with that story. Recommended.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|A big dissappointment, unlike the original and not as good as the original.  Basically a mindless story with no direction or explanation of what is happening.  At least the first one told a story and you understood who Perseus was and what the whole purpose of the movie was.  In this one...there was no explanation, no accurate narration, and no purpose to the movie.  Friends of mine who saw it and didn't see the original first, didn't understand it at all.
B000IHQTLY|5.0|I have never been a sandal wearer because I treasure the use of my toes too much to be jamming them into foreign objects,rocks, gravel, stickers and splinters. But that was before I discovered Keen. That big black toe box that I used to think was ugly on casual shoes has now become a required element on every shoe I buy. It's a lot like the VW Beetle- you grow to love it. I love Keen and now have casuals, winter boots and hiking boots with the same beautiful big black toe box. I finally gave in and bought the sandals. Now my toes are still happy but my feet can enjoy the air that they haven't felt in many years of wearing sneakers. PEW! The soles on these are amazingly comfy and they are really well made in real leather and waterproof unlike most sandals. I'm impressed.
B002ZG98J6|1.0|There were too many changes from the book and too many liberties taken by the director, Chris Columbus.  The ages were not appropriate to he story.  The movie was unlike the book in too many ways.  Very poor adaptation.   The movie also had a mis-matched and bad cast.  The acting was marginal, especially from the star - Logan Lerman.  The kid who played Luke was a far better actor than Lerman.  He is a poor actor, at best, and more \\"deadpan\\" in his delivery than the others in the movie.  The girl heroine was fair.  The kid who played the satir was far better and had more energy and enthusiasm than the others.  Pierce Brosnan as the centaur was disturbing and almost laughable.  A big dissappointment!
B002KKCWP4|4.0|About six weeks ago I set out on a goal to get in better shape. I love walking so I figured I'd start there. As a woman I naturally love shoes but primarily have lived most of my life barefoot or in flip flops. Over the past 6 weeks I've gone through an array of high end running/walking shoes. Including being professionally fitted plus insoles.     I was battling shin splints, blisters everywhere, I tried different shoes, toe socks, etc.. I started thinking that maybe something like the Vibrams were a better fit because of my foot structure. I have medium arches, no gait abnormalities, my feet are wide, and straight. I start researching and saw that an alternative option was trail sandals. I went into a local store and tried these on and felt instantly better. So as is my normal routine came to Amazon to find them and of course they were cheaper.    They arrived yesterday and I am so happy I made this switch! I am a 8.5 W in women's so I ordered the 7 in men's. I found that the men's naturally had a wider foot bed. My feet have plenty of room. There are three great adjustment points, sufficient support, as well as padding. I was nervous about moisture because in S. Florida but these weren't a problem. I walked about 6.88 miles last night. The only complaint I have and is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the seams on the neoprene padding on the straps did give me a small blister on both heels. Nothing a little moleskin won't fix. Other than that I would highly recommend these for anyone who is looking for an athletic shoe alternative for long distance walking. Especially for women with a wider foot. I ordered the Brown Bombay and it's not too masculine at all.    Enjoy!

B001IAOEXU|5.0|These are literally the best accessories you can buy for your PS3 controller for games that use the L2 and R2 triggers a lot, like racing games or shooters. They greatly increase the comfort of those buttons as well as helping you maintain your grip when pressing them. Your fingers will never slide off the triggers again with these things, which is a great improvement over the original design. I use these especially for racing games and it is definitely more comfortable to use them to accelerate and brake than using the X and Square buttons, and my hands don't get nearly as tired after extended play. As for them falling off, I haven't had it happen to me yet while using the controller, regardless of how hard I press on them. They do pop off if you drop the controller, but they attach right back on without any problems. I greatly recommend these to anyone who would like better trigger buttons on their PS3 controllers. Best $5 I've ever spent on video games or accessories.
0689859414|5.0|My daughter loves the Spiderwick series and the illustrations in this book are beautiful!!  Makes the story completely come alive.  Excellent book!
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|I was surprised how much I ended up liking this film.  The actors are truly great, and the writing was witty.  The story is a romantic comedy, but with an edge, a significant edge, so it isn't as sappy as one might expect.  Yes, too good to be true, it IS hollywood after all, but thoroughly enjoyable.  Both my husband and I loved it.  How's that for a review?  A great date movie.
1416589473|5.0|I really liked this book and am glad I got it, not only does it give me a view for the world both in lore and in setting but also it tells me a great story to keep me interested with a nice little twist towards the end.
0316044695|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  It is alot more than just the one mission that went bad in Afghanistan.  The story goes back and forth between Marcus' family life and upbringing in Texas, his navy/SEAL training, his earlier missions in Iraq/Afghanistan and stories about all his SEAL buddies.  After every action movie character is made an \\"ex Navy SEAL\\" it has become a throwaway line without much meaning, so to read the accounts of the brutal training these guys go through and the missions they are given on active duty the reader is reminded that these are truly the best our country has to offer.  I couldn't be prouder of these guys.      The turning point of the book is the decision of what to do when they bumped into the goat herders while on a reconnaissance  mission.  That situation is incredibly difficult and I hope our military is using this example in shaping its rules of engagement.  The book does a good job of explaining how the enemy knows our rules of engagement and use them against us.  When they are in a dangerous location and are discovered by unarmed civilians, what should they do?  There's no easy answer.  Obviously in hindsight they should have executed these unarmed civilians because they turned out to be spies.  But there's no way of knowing it at that time.     The only thing I thought was missing is more information on the rescue helicopter crash.  Maybe since there were no survivors there was no one to tell the story of what happened.  I don't know.    I hope it gets made into a movie.
B001TH16DI|4.0|A great edition of these movies! My only wish is that they had included the Director's Edition of Star Trek: The Motion Picture! But otherwise, incredible.
1594202842|3.0|Enjoying this book requires recognizing irony.  Clues are that the author calls pitches notes and says the Temple of Poseidon is in Athens.  I expected the book to be about applying the Taoist ideal of humility to raising children to value giving more than taking.  But this ramble isn't about Chinese culture or any social values but rather about Amy Chua's or your cappuccino-driven egocentrism.  Apparently, she's a typical spoiled occidental professional jerk and treats her children accordingly, and she writes as Charlie Sheen talks.  Her idea of humility seems to be saying that a bamboo hut \\"has its charm.\\" Such judgmentalism apparently defines her.  So any joke's on her.  Or on you.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I cannot wait for this product! It is going to be the best way to experience Star Wars as George Lucas imagined it. If you don't like the additions that Lucas made, than don't buy it, and certainly don't post negative reviews when you haven't even seen the final product. The bonus features alone make this a worthy addition to any Star Wars collection.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|Twelve-year-old Owen is mercilessly abused by his schoolmates.  He is befriended by a strange neighbor, Abby, who doesn't wear shoes in the snow; Abby has been twelve years old for a very long time and keeps insisting she's not a girl.  Abby is a vampire who feeds on her neighbors.  Victims of child abuse, Owen and Abby form a romantic bond that will eventually have tragic consequences.<br /><br />  \\"Let Me In\\" is a horror film that I would've enjoyed more if I hadn't already seen the original Swedish version \\"Let the Right One In.\\"  \\"Let the Right One In\\" is a superb psychological horror film centered around lonely, troubled adolescents who can empathize with one another; based on the best-selling novel of the same title, it has developed a worldwide cult following.<br /><br />  The acting in \\"Let Me In\\" is superb.  Child stars Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz give excellent performances.  However, the real surprise came from Richard Jenkins who gave an award-winning performance as the mild mannered music professor in \\"The Visitor.\\"  Coincidentally, in \\"The Visitor,\\" Jenkins befriends and aids two illegal immigrants.  In \\"Let Me In,\\" he befriends and protects the vampire Abby and is even forced to kill for her.  These scenes were quite shocking.  From the commentary, we learn Jenkins performed all his own stunts.<br /><br />  The plot for \\"Let Me In\\" is very similar to the one for \\"Let the Right One In.\\"  Much of the dialogue, especially from Owen and Abby, was verbatim.  The major difference was the introduction of the policeman who replaces the role of the nosy, vindictive neighbor in \\"Let the Right One In.\\"  The policeman made \\"Let Me In\\" more realistic; however, viewers developed a liking for the policeman's character.  The outcome of his investigation draws sympathy away from the children who are made to look more like evil villains rather than the ill-fated victims of the novel's intent.<br /><br />  Despite the fact that \\"Let Me In\\" is a low-budget Hammer production (famous for their classic horror films of the late fifties to early seventies), the special effects are quite awesome.  The extra features on the DVD are required viewing.  They display the computer graphics used when Abby viciously attacks her victims and climbs trees, fences and hospital walls.  The elaborate car crash sequence was filmed outdoors using a cameraman mounted on the vehicle who was actually driving it; the scene was also filmed on stage in front of a blue screen and the vehicle was attached to a giant chicken rotisserie that spun it around and around.<br /><br />  The commentary from Matt Reeves (visionary director of the innovative, groundbreaking \\"Cloverfield\\" - a gloomy, claustrophobic monster film as seen from the lens of a home video camera) is interesting and informative.  I was never bored.  It was unbelievable to learn what was actually filmed at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and what was created by computer graphics.  For example, remember when Jenkins attacks the boy at the railroad tracks?  The train never existed.  Also, from listening to Reeves, one learns more about Abby's background and why she keeps telling Owen that she is not a girl when he wants to date her.  One must watch the deleted scene titled \\"Be Me.\\"  Actually, the entire film is about Owen empathizing with Abby's plight.  She kills in order to survive; however, Owen can't judge her because he fantasizes about killing Kenny and the other bullies.<br /><br />  The viewer learns there are numerous instances of child abuse in \\"Let Me In.\\"  Owen seems to suffer the most in the film.  He is psychologically harmed by his parents' divorce and is bullied at school by Kenny.  Kenny is bullied by his older brother; therefore, he relieves his pent-up anger and stress by abusing Owen.  Many years ago, Abby was forever physically traumatized by an elderly nun.  Now she is forced to feed on the blood of others.  \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is a novel read by Owen and his classmates whichis apropos to the film.  A tragedy, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" mirrors the doomed romance of Owen and Abby; eventually, it will lead to tragedy.  The commentary suggests that Jenkins' character was once a twelve-year-old boy who developed a friendship with Abby.<br /><br />  With the aid of a powerful magnifying glass, I read the full color miniature comic book, \\"Let Me In: Crossroads,\\" that was included with my copy of the DVD.  It has good illustrations.  The first of four in a new series, this comic is a prelude to the film.  Taking place in the farming community of Wellsville, Indiana, it gives Abby's guardian/protector a name, Thomas, and depicts more of Abby's vicious quest for blood.  Fans of the film may want to read this comic book series from Dark Horse Comics and Hammer.<br /><br />  I would've enjoyed \\"Let Me In\\" more if Matt Reeves had made it more different from the Swedish film \\"Let the Right One In.\\"  My dad said the same thing.  While watching the opening scenes of \\"Let Me In,\\" he asked, \\"Didn't I see that boy and girl in another film?\\"  I told him we had watched \\"Let the Right One In,\\" which has the same plot.  Reeves should have taken into consideration the fans who had already seen \\"Let the Right One In.\\"  Also, the gory finale of \\"Let Me In\\" would've been more enjoyable if the bullies hadn't turned the lights off in the pool house.  If it hadn't been for the commentary, I wouldn't have known exactly what had happened.  \\"Let Me In\\" is gorier and has superior special effects than \\"Let the Right One In.\\"  However, the latter came first and has the element of surprise.<br /><br />  I have no regrets watching \\"Let Me In.\\"  I feel that I learned a lot more about the relationship between the vampire and the boy.  In order to learn the complete story, I feel compelled to read the novel \\"Let the Right One In\\" by John Ajvide Lindqvist.  According to Matt Reeves, the film would have to be a miniseries in order to give justice to the highly involved novel.  I have read Lindqvist's novel \\"Handling the Undead,\\" which is an expertly written psychological horror novel focusing on people's reactions upon learning their loved ones have returned from the grave.  \\"Let Me In\\" is required viewing if you want to delve deeper into the mystique of the Swedish horror sensation \\"Let the Right One In.\\"<br /><br />Joseph B.

The thing that struck me was there are many new cutting edge learning techniques being used very successfully but they are NOT being used in our educational  institutions - why not? An eye-opening and brain expanding book - use some of your plasticity and read it.
B000002H2H|5.0|Easily one of my favorites of all time, Ride the Lightning is what I could call upon if anyone asked me give offer an example of thrash metal. This album contains some of Metallica's most tasty cuts such as \\"For Whom the Bell Toll's\\" \\"Fade to Black\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Creeping Death\\". If you are into the genre you probably already have this album... But if not, just get it already!
1401923127|1.0|The subject of beliefs and their effects on our mind body is certainly worthy of exploration and I had hoped The Biology of Belief would offer some useful insights. I had heard Dr Lipton speak on the subject and never quite got what was talking about. I really wanted to like this book. Instead I found it a monumental chore as I dragged myself from sentence to sentence trying to understand the scientific jargon he uses to explain his concepts. He is well respected in his field but I found this book to be wholly lacking in any kind of takeaway of practical, applicable value, pedantic in the extreme. There are some<br />hints at useful information and they could all have been written in plain English<br />on about 20 pages. I never made it to the end, just an unbearable grind all the way.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica used to rule the thrash metal scene with an iron fist. With albums like \\"Master of Puppets\\", who could not admit that they were the best at what they did. Possibly the greatest metal album of all time (I like \\"Ride the Lightning\\" a little more though), \\"Master of Puppets\\" hits hard from start to finish. I would certainly recommend purchasing this album to anyone.

B004IJZFP4|4.0|(NOTE - a portion of this review is featured in Maximum Ink Music Magazine. Used by permission.)     Sometimes the next best thing is all we can hope for. Even better is when the next best thing exceeds expectations. This is the case with the new CD release of unreleased recordings by late guitar virtuoso Tommy Bolin.    Bolin made his mark in the early to mid 70s by playing some completely mind blowing lead guitar on Billy Cobham's 'Spectrum' and Deep Purple's 'Come Taste The Band'. Fans of the musician's meaty chops and dizzying triplets were pleasantly surprised by his subsequent solo records, which showed more expressive range and beautifully delivered vocals. The first of these albums, 1975's 'Teaser', has never been released on CD form domestically, and the import issues have been sorely lacking in sonic quality. The last this reporter heard, Sony/Universal didn't feel the project would generate enough return to make it's reissue a priority.    Therefore, 35 years after it's release, the new 'Teaser Deluxe' project, spearheaded by Greg Hampton with the blessing of Johnnie Bolin, is truly reason to rejoice. Hampton has unearthed previously unheard multi-tracks of the 'Teaser' sessions, and brought alternate takes of those tracks up to 21st century audio standards.    Originally, Bolin envisioned the 'Teaser' project to be half instrumental, half vocal, but management shied away from featuring too many instrumentals. This new CD brings back some of Bolin's vision, with the inclusion of two out-takes of the far-out jazz metal romp \\"Crazed Fandango\\". One version displays the soaring saxophone of David Sanborn, while the other features more piano and guitar. Additionally, some songs that were closer to the 4:00 mark on the 1975 release, now run well over eleven minutes in length, giving Bolin room to stretch out his frenetic soloing. The extended jamming functions better on the smoother \\"Lotus\\" than on the straight-ahead rock of \\"Wild Dogs\\", but both are intriguingto compare to the final LP edits. Also of interest is the inclusion of Bolin singing along to some of the lead parts in \\"Wild Dogs\\" and \\"Savannah Woman\\".    Attention should also be given to the addition of intro riffs counting off \\"Homeward Strut\\" and \\"Marching Powder\\", which gives the listener a little teaser of sorts before the song as it's known materializes. In some cases, such as the rhythm guitar flanger on \\"Homeward Strut\\", subtleties are brought to light that were lost, or simply not present, on the '75 LP.    'Teaser Deluxe' is a must for anyone who enjoys sincere rock and roll with diversified flavors. I'm thankful that these aural treats can be tasted once again. Play loud!

B002ZG99NG|5.0|Years ago a young actor named Ben Affleck soared to super stardom with the critically acclaimed film \\"Good Will Hunting\\". To follow that up Ben starred in a series of very successful (although not always critically appreciated) blockbusters such as \\"Armageddon\\", \\"Pearl Harbor\\", and \\"Daredevil\\". But after suffering a string of box office disappointments (everyone remembers \\"Gigli\\", need I say more) Ben disappeared for a brief time from the public eye.    Then in 2006, he re-emerged as a talented dramatic actor in his excellent portrayal of the late George Reeves in \\"Hollywoodland\\". To which he followed up with his surprisingly brilliant big screen directorial debut with \\"Gone Baby Gone\\". Since that time, Ben has chosen his projects with much more care, and his most recent directing and acting effort is the stellar heist film, \\"The Town\\".    \\"The Town\\" is the story of a crew of bank robbers that are as close as brothers and led by the increasingly reluctant Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck). Despite their numerous successful heists, Doug has grown tired of \\"the life\\", and having fallen for a young woman named Claire (Rebecca Hall) he now has a reason to walk away from not only crime, but his \\"brothers\\" and the only city he's ever known. However, the more Doug tries to break away, the harder his best friend Jimmy (Jeremy Renner) pulls to keep him around for the proverbial \\"one last job\\"; all the while a seasoned FBI agent (Jon Hamm) is closing in on the crew and time is running out.    With so many heist films having been released over the years it's undoubtedly become difficult for any writer to craft a story that can be considered fresh within this sub-genre. However, the approach this movie takes by allowing the viewer a fly-on-the-wall perspective for every step of the crime gave it a more original feel. Of course, having a solid script and top-notch acting didn't hurt either.    The screenplay written by Peter Craig (first-time screenwriter) and the writing duo behind \\"Gone Baby Gone\\", Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard, is the perfect blend of intensity, drama, action, and even a little bit of romance. Each facet of this film's story works flawlessly together to create one of the strongest entries into the heist film sub-genre in quite some time.    The story for the entire film was perfectly paced to allow for plenty of character development, along with a natural increase in intensity and/or anxiety prior to the heists. Nothing about the film seemed rushed in order to get to the next job, and the intensity (or anxiety, depending) of each character was shared by the audience throughout the film. Truth be told, drawing an audience in to a movie to such a degree is something that not every film manages to accomplish and to do so is an achievement unto itself.    Guiding the story is director Ben Affleck, who was pulling triple duty on this film serving as co-writer, star, and director. With his directorial work here and in his previous film, \\"Gone Baby Gone\\", Ben is shaping up to become one of the best directors of his time. Some have even gone on to say that he could be the next Clint Eastwood (in terms of directing), and with that statement I would have to agree.    Ben has now shown that he clearly knows how to execute intense dramatic pieces, and even some well orchestrated action sequences as well. Also, his ability to get top-notch performances from his fellow actors is a testament to how respected he is as a director, despite his past as a media lightning rod.    From Ben's previous film and now to \\"The Town\\" one can clearly see his incredible talent as a filmmaker, and I for one look forward to seeing what he directs next.    While on the subject of Ben Affleck, let's discuss his performance, along with his costars while we're at it. Leading the ensemble cast, as I've already mentioned, is Ben Affleck, and his performance here is one of his best. Actually, it is probably his absolute best so far, narrowly beating out his terrificjob in \\"Hollywoodland\\".    As Doug MacRay, Ben displays a decidedly darker edge, necessary to lead a crew of thieves, but also a surprisingly gentle nature that values life above all. Whether it is the lives of his fellow crew members or their victims, Doug will go to great lengths to plan his heists with every life taken into account.    On the opposite side of that coin is Jeremy Renner's character and Doug's best friend, Jimmy. Jeremy who is no stranger to an excellent performance (see him in \\"The Hurt Locker\\" for further evidence) truly earned his Academy Award nomination with his fiercely malevolent portrayal. In this role, Jeremy is almost unrecognizable from his Boston accent to his physical appearance to his downright evil nature, this character is as much of a departure from his role in the aforementioned as one can possibly get, and he excels in it at every turn.    In the other primary supporting roles we find even more incredible performances, including one I found to be very surprising. First off, is actor Jon Hamm who has found himself with an incredible surge in his career with a terrific performance in this film coupled with his continued success on AMC's \\"Mad Men\\". I find myself perplexed by the fact that Jon hasn't been more prominent in feature films prior to this one, a problem that I believe will likely be remedied from now on.    As the lead FBI agent tracking Doug and his crew, Jon exudes authority and strength every step of the way, and an intensity that reveals a man consumed by his work. Jon had moments in the film where he could have played the role more over-the-top and borderline maniacal in his quest for justice, but Jon played everything believably and never once made a moment feel forced.    Serving as Ben's love interest is actress Rebecca Hall (\\"Frost/Nixon\\") who is not the most recognizable of actresses out there, but soon could be with performances like this one. Her performance was incredibly raw in its emotional punch, yet withan inner strength that belied her character's troubled life.    As the most surprising cast member in terms of performance is actress Blake Lively (TV's \\"Gossip Girl\\") as Doug's off-and-on \\"friend with benefits\\". Blake's performance as a drug addicted, possibly abused, single mother is unexpectedly profound given that I always felt she seemed like just another pretty face that couldn't act for anything. I now stand corrected, and if her future performances carry as much weight as this one then she will definitely be one to watch.    Lastly, are two always amazing and top-notch character actors that only appear for a short time in this film, Chris Cooper (\\"The Bourne Identity\\") and Pete Postlethwaite (\\"Inception\\"). Despite their lack of screen time, both actors make the absolute most of there scenes and deliver terrific performances as well. Typically when actors of their caliber are placed in such small roles, I would have felt disappointed that their talents were used for so little. However, in this film, I think their brief appearances were appropriately limited and served the movie perfectly.    Sadly, the ever-reliable Pete Postlethwaite passed away a month or so ago, but at least he got to appear in two of the best films of 2010, \\"Inception\\" and of course, \\"The Town\\". He was never the most well-known of actors, at least not by name, but whenever you would see him in a movie you would always recognize him and know that his would be a performance to watch.    In the end, boasting incredible performances from the entire cast and a terrific story, \\"The Town\\" is a taut, intense heist thriller that is expertly handled from start to finish courtesy of director, co-writer, and star Ben Affleck. This movie was essentially the shot of adrenaline that was needed to reinvigorate this increasingly generic sub-genre of cinema.    \\"The Town\\" is rated R for violence, language, drug references, and sexuality.

0060512806|4.0|First, I never would have read this book if it had not been for my Kindle.  For a good number of years I have avoided lengthy books because of their weight which makes them tiresome to handle and typically the print is small which also makes them tiresome and hard to read, so the Kindle is a great tool for reading a long and heavy book like Cryptonomicon.    As regards the book itself, overall I found it quite enjoyable as it blends history, technology, geography, important historical personalities, excellent writing, mathematics, computers, and many other subjects of interest to me into a package that at times reads like a Clive Cussler Dirk Pitt novel.  At times I really could not figure out how Neal Stephenson was able to come up with such original phrasing combined with a vocabulary that I must admit is well above my own.  On almost every page I found it necessary to refer to the dictionary for words that I had not seen before or could not remember their meaning.  In every case the word Neal used was the perfect one for the circumstance.  As he is relatively young and did not get a Harvard or M.I.T. education, I can only attribute it to him growing up in a family of highly educated professionals who did a lot of his education at the dinner table.    Another thing I liked about the book were the main characters Bobby Shaftoe, GoTo Dengo, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, Randy Waterhouse, Avi,  Alan Turing, the Dentist, and many others who were well developed and given real personality by the author.  This and the overall plot were the things that made this book quite enjoyable.    On the somewhat less enjoyable side and the reason I did not give this book five stars were the following.  First the ending, after asking the reader to slog with him throughout the world and all the way through World War II, I thought the ending was really weak and almost like an afterthought.  It seemed like Neal ran out of writing energy at this point.  It also seemed like he got kindof goofy at the end by bringing Bobby Shaftoe, GoTo Dengo, and General Douglas Macarthur together in the middle of a baseball diamond during the final battle for Manila.  This is fantasy that loses its entertainment value.  Also I did not like the forty or fifty pages devoted to the relationships between various Greek and Roman Gods, a good editor would have gotten rid of this entire segment.    Another thing I hated in the Kindle edition of this book is the two hundred page article about worldwide undersea laying of communication cables.  This article is dated, more than ten years old, uninteresting, old technology, most of the companies talked about have gone out of business, and has no place at all being in this book.  Maybe this tourist trip was of interest to Neal ten years ago but it really turned me off by being inserted in this book.  Amazon and Neal should do us all a favor and permanently delete it as irrelevant.      In spite of my complaints on these few issues, I would still highly recommend that you read Cryptonomicon.  When I recuperate from reading it, I will probably read Quicksilver but it will be a few more months before I am ready for it.

0316098337|4.0|\\"Room,\\" by Emma Donoghue is an incredibly complex novel.  It is at once deeply disturbing yet redemptive, humorously clever yet terrifyingly unflinching in its honesty.       The story is told from the perspective of Jack, a five year old boy who's entire world, from end to end, exists within the confines of an 11'x11' room.  His mother, kidnapped at nineteen years of age, is a sex slave and he is the product of the repeated rapes.         It is without a doubt a taboo subject.  Upon reading, the true complexity of the novel comes out.  As a preservice English teacher, I can't help but ask myself \\"Could I teach this in my classroom?  If so, how would I go about it?\\"  The book addresses a very real issue; people are being kidnapped, bought, sold, raped and killed everyday in the underground world of human trafficking.  Many of the details, and the subject matter itself, may appear to be far too graphic for a classroom, but there is so much more to this book that comes to the surface upon reading.  One can analyze the book through a psychological lens, delving into the issues that present themselves as byproducts of isolation and abuse...how about that Freudian \\"Room/Womb\\" construct!?  The book can launch a fantastic discussion with a feminist slant, touching on concepts of sexual agency and repression.  These are only two examples, but the options are many and varied in nature.       Truly, this books greatest asset, in an education context, is its complexity.  The softest, warmest heart of human compassion is on display.  Conversely, the darkest, most depraved side of humanity is starkly and unapologetically depicted as well.  The book was thrilling, heart-warming, at times too \\"real\\" for comfort, and most importantly, entertaining while being informative.  Great literature shouldn't go down smoothly; it should poke and prod, forcing a reaction out of the reader, and this book does this in spades.
B004B63M1S|5.0|This movie was ridiculous, overly gory, simplistic, and full of stereotypes.  I loved every minute of it.    Seriously, it's a typical Rodriguez movie with lots of blood, action, and hot women.  Yes, there is some political innuendo but unless you're a card-carrying tea party member with no sense of humor it's not bothersome.  If you liked Planet Terror and Desperado you'll love this movie.  That said, I'm waiting to buy until the Director's cut with bonus features comes out...

1591843790|5.0|\\"Enchantment\\" provided me with the opportunity to experience a moment of simultaneous personal and professional illumination.  I say this having had this happen only once before (about 35 years ago) when I read Albert Ellis' book \\"A New Guide to Rational Living\\".  I was in the middle of grad school in Social Work, training to become a psychotherapist and it wasn't until I read Ellis' book that I was able to understand how my natural style of relating to people was actually  congruent with the theories he was positing about human behavior and emotions and how best to be effective in helping people cope.  It was an \\"ah ha\\" moment.     Fast forward to 2005 where after a long and successful career as a psychotherapist, I closed my practice to start a toy company.  I always had an entrepreneurial streak but it pretty much manifested itself in the public sector in the form of program development for at risk populations.  After conjuring up an idea to create plush grandparent dolls that would sing traditional Spanish language lullabies and nursery rhymes, I felt compelled to take my idea \\" the distance\\".  I put together a partnership team of creative and talented people in design, music, and business and within 18 months of having the initial idea, our dolls were and are in Walmart, Target and Toys R Us.  Our dolls and concept of highlighting the iconic role of grandparents in families really touch an emotional chord and I receive amazing emails from people who have really been impacted by the early memories the dolls evoke.  When I heard about this book, my first thought was, \\"that's what Baby Abuelita does...it enchants the customer...young and old\\" [[ASIN:B000AX23P2 Baby Abuelita Productions - Rosa]].  As a psychotherapist, it means so much to me that our dolls have this unintended benefit and bring our customers so much joy.  (the mission of Baby Abuelita is to preserve Hispanic musical cultural and traditions for all generations)    So, while in my two professionsI have always seemed to follow my instincts, both conscious and unconscious, it is once again great to know that there is actually a \\"method to my madness\\".  I now have a new word that captures the essence of who we are!  Thank you for writing this book and for sharing your insights, wisdom and knowledge.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I bought this because I had been looking at it for a long time now and found it on eBay for $70 brand new. Got it today and opened it, checked to make sure all the discs were right and they were all over the place. They slide down through the flimsy cardboard cover and I had a bunch that were on top of each other and out of the plastic covers they're in. Also, a lot of the cardboard sleeve tops, where the disc goes under, has broken away from the back part.... So now you put the disc back in the spot and it immediately slides out the sides, through the bottom under the disc below it, or straight out of the top. I don't like the Barbie case thing, but I mean, oh well, they're all in one place and that's good enough. The actual case is nice and sturdy though unlike the sleeves.    At $20 for individual seasons +shipping, even on Amazon you are paying about the same amount and getting it in one package. The extras are nice, but I'm afraid they might ruin the show for me, so I just glanced over them. So if you have all of the seasons already and they are in good condition, DO NOT get rid of them for this. Once they get ruined as DVDs do, then buy this. If you have no DVDs and want them, get this. Some seasons, then it's really up to you, I would say get this anyway, but it's obviously your choice.    I'm not a DVD seasons kind of person. I have Netflix and I used to just DVR Gilmore Girls episodes everyday when they aired in order (thank you abcfamily), but I got this. They're too expensive. So I would recommend this to anyone who really likes the show. It's a series set and it's quality. It's not like this is some unauthorized series set made up by some random person.. it's pretty standard DVD quality stuff. Don't let the packaging turn you away from a great thing. Since all it is is two pieces of cardboard with semi circles, you could honestly get some super glue and glue a little stopper on the back part and then reglue the front to the back and it'll be better thanwhen it was still in the factory.    Anyway, I recommend to any fan, unless you have 1-7 already. There isn't much extra to warrant getting this, you basically have it already. Everyone else, no seasons, or just some, look around and find a decent price, then jump on it.

0316098337|4.0|Emma Donoghue's \\"Room\\" pulls us in within pages and takes us on an exceptional journey that is unlike any other.  Donoghue does not hesitate to astonish us since it begins with two characters held captive in a single room.  Jack, our child narrative, and his \\"Ma\\" must construct their lives around confinement and minimize their reality.  Although Jack is pleased with the confinement of his life this is only because he has never known the vastness of the social world.  Donoghue's dialogue immediately draws us into Jack's delightfulness and his mother's pain of being a continuous rape victim by her captor.  The remarkable relationship between Jack and \\"Ma\\" requires us to invest in their journey to find a way to escape in hopes of eventually adapting to a world outside \\"Room.\\"    Even though a rewarding read for any older age, this novel particularly belongs in the high school classroom.  It can easily fit into any hands without the fear that it favours boys or favours girls.  Besides its gender-neutral composition, it has a riveting plot that can grab hold of any reluctant young reader.  This is a perfect story to instil and encourage the ultimate goal of English teaching- Life Long Reading.  But an attractive plot isn't the only benefit this story brings to the classroom since Donoghue beautifully illustrates a perspective on reality unlike any other, which is worth exploring with students. And even though the story exposes life as sex victim, Donoghue writes in such a beautiful way that is appropriate in the classroom.   Overall, it is a remarkable journey that students should not miss out on.       \\"Room\\" is a wonderfully written story that tugs at nearly every emotion.  This matchless tale will have you once again hiding under your bed sheets with a flash light, determined to get from start to finish.

1439102724|3.0|I have been a Jodi Picoult fan for years, and have read every last one of her books and enjoyed them immensely.  This book was such a disappointment.  It felt like one long preaching moment.  It wasn't so much a novel as it was a statement for Gay Rights, and a rant against Christians.  Sure, I believe that maybe some Christians can be cruel in saying that the Bible condemns the practice, and I believe that Gays should have the right to marry, but in a novel I was hoping for more neutrality.<br /><br />As for the characters, those on the side of Gay rights are the saints, and the church-goers are the sinners, or maybe just flat and boring characters.  Zoe is a music therapists and one of her beliefs is that music therapists are saints because they use their talent for good, while other musicians are all about ego.  Where would a music therapist get the music they use for 'healing', if it weren't for the egotistical musicians who wrote the music.  So all the songs that make up the background of our lives, that help us through our sorrows and help us celebrate, these were all written by ego-maniacs who are all about ego?<br /><br />As Sing You Home states, no one would choose to be gay.  Would choose to be a musician?  To be haunted by beautiful music from the other side and never be able to recreate it.  To play for crowds who tell you to turn down your heart's message because they can't hear their drunken selves think?  To hit the road, away from all you love, living in hotels all so you can sing for 2 hours to a crowd that might not understand what you're trying to say? How a broken heart feels?  How being in love feels?  Seems as if musicians might suffer for their art, just like Gays have to suffer for their lifestyle. I bought the hard-cover because it had a CD in it that Picoult wrote the words to?  I thought it was a great marketing tool to get people into bookstores to buy the hardcover instead of a download, but is Picoult an ego-maniac too because she chose to write beautiful music?<br /><br />  SPOILER ALERT READ NO FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED THE BOOK!!!!!!<br /><br />I had a hard time even liking the main character?

0517548232|5.0|Henry Hazlitt was a truly great writer.  The arguments he develops are simply and clearly stated.  While written in a way that any literate person can digest, this may not be a book for someone completely new to economics and government policy.  However, if every student read this after an introductory primer on economics, I am confident the world would be a better place.  Economics is of primal importance to society and everyone owes it to themselves and their children to make sure that this important knowledge is shared and not lost from our generation to the next.  My kids will be reading this as one of their required books before graduating from high school.  I also recommend anything from Murray Rothbard.

1423101502|4.0|So I finally come to it, the fifth and final book in the Percy Jackson series and the culmination of his coming-of-age story. At the age of twelve our hero found out that his father was the god Poseidon, making him a demi-god with a place waiting for him at Camp Half-Blood, the summer camp designed to teach and train the children of the gods. As Percy quickly realizes, it's a dangerous world if you're a half-blood, particularly since he attracts monsters like a magnet.<br /><br />Under the guidance of the centaur Charon and his best friend Grover the satyr, Percy thrives in his new environment and has already proven his worth by having undertaken several quests over the course of the past four books, alongside his friend Annabeth (the daughter of Athena) and various other camp members: the children of Hermes, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephasteus and other gods of the Greek pantheon.<br /><br />But always hanging over Percy's head is a prophesy declaring that on his sixteenth birthday he will make a decision that will either save or destroy Olympus. With the rise of Kronos and the Titans, who are steadily gathering their allies and building up their armies for an assault on Mount Olympus, Percy and his friends prepare their own defenses. It's a grim battle that awaits them, for leading the assault is their former friend Luke, who was corrupted by Kronos and currently possessed by his spirit.<br /><br />Needless to say, if you have not caught up on the previous Percy Jackson adventures, you'll be rather lost jumping on the bandwagon this late in the game - you'll have to start back with [[ASIN:0786856297 The Lightning Thief]] and work your way up. Now with his birthday fast-approaching, and his allies spread thin across the land, sea and air in their attempt to hold back the forces of the Titans, Percy is astonished to find himself the appointed war-general of the half-blood campers, defending Manhattan from the onslaught of Kronos's army of monsters.<br /><br />Though most of the book is straight-out action sequences, in which Percy (having made a startling strategic decision early on in the book) fights the legion of monsters bombarding New York, there is also time for some back-story into Luke's tragic past, the threat of a spy in the Olympian's midst, a strange destiny unfurling before Percy's mortal friend Rachel Elizabeth Dare, and an internal crisis when Percy ponders the possibility that maybe the Titans have a *point* when it comes to their vendetta against the neglectful, vindictive, irresponsible gods.<br /><br />Essentially, if the previous books were all set-ups, this final installment is all pay-off - though whether or not you think Riordan delivers is up to you. Riordan has kept careful track of his various plot arcs and dangling threads, and there's very little left hanging by the end of the book. Most of the characters introduced in the previous books return here to help or hinder our heroes, whether they be mortals, half-bloods or gods, and Riordan ensures that each of them gets their personal moment of glory.<br /><br />Completely gone is the usual formula of the cross-country adventure fraught with monsters, (just as well, as this was getting rather stale), for \\"The Last Olympian\\" rushes by at a turbulent pace that never slows down for a second, from the opening act in which Percy attempts to blow up Luke's cruise ship, to his secret mission alongside Nico de Angeli to secure invulnerability for himself, to the battle for New York, which takes up most of the book. Some may find that this battle gets rather repetitive after a while: the half-blood campers fight furiously against a variety of monsters, only for a third party to arrive at the most opportune moment.<br /><br />As always, Riordan keeps Percy's first-person narrative, a dangerous technique in the wrong hands, but which ends up being the strongest element of this series. Percy's inner monologue is self-effacing and down-to-earth, with plenty of snarky commentary on himself, his world, and the crazy scenarios that he finds himself thrown into. I'm going to miss his voice. In fact, at the risk of scandalizing the throngs of Harry Potter fans, I find myself enjoying the character of light-hearted Percy far more than that of moody Harry. Although your opinion may wildly differ from mine, I found that when the time comes for the protagonist of each series to make their character-defining choice, Percy's decision was more stirring than Harry's. Perhaps not as heartbreaking, but certainly more life-affirming. At the conclusion of the Percy Jackson series, I got the sense that Riordan felt it was not enough to simply save the world - it had to be changed as well.<br /><br />Speaking of Harry Potter, the comparisons are inevitable. This is a series named after its lead hero concerning a battle between good and evil fought with magic by teenagers, with a romantic subplot, plenty of monsters and a prophesy that probably doesn't mean what the protagonists think it does. The world of Percy Jackson is (much like the wizarding world of Harry Potter) a secret world within our own, in which updated versions of the Greek gods still continue their immortal lives, just as carelessly, recklessly and hypocritically as they did back in Ancient Greece. Because they are manifestations of Western culture and tradition, they move along with the shift of power in the world, which means that Mount Olympus is currently located on the top of the Empire State building in New York. It's a nice twist on the old stories, and for those with foreknowledge of the Grecian myths, it'll be even more rewarding to see what Riordan does with his updated versions (I especially liked the replaying of the Achilles and Patroclus friendship replayed between two half-bloods).<br /><br />All in all, I've enjoyed reading the Percy Jackson series. It's had its flaws and its quirks, and it's doubtful that the movie franchise will take off in the same way the Harry Potter films did, but for the duration of the five books it was a wild ride - with a pretty big hint that there's more to come.<br /><br />Oh, and if you're wondering who \\"the last Olympian\\" of the title is...you'll be surprised.that he finds himself thrown into.

B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I've been underwhelmed with her last few books, mostly because I can figure them out very quickly. This one not only touched me, but kept me guessing. I thought it was great.  I'd give it 4.5 stars.
B003W5C0VM|5.0|As the saying goes \\"The Greatest Rock n Roll Band in the World,Ladies & Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones\\", this is the Stones at their VERY BEST. Before Mick became a parody of himself and just before Keith fixed his teeth, Bill is still in the band and so is Mick Taylor and Bobby Keyes. Great concert audio and footage perfect selection of songs not just the usual, I really enjoyed it...made me pick up a Tele and rip off the low E, tune it up to open G and rock out on Brown Sugar...yeah yeah yeah wooooooo! Way cool video of the iconic band...
031250926X|1.0|My 12 month old son loves the Brown Bear book - we already had 2 copies of the board book (one hand me down and one given as a gift) and it is my son's favorite book.  He especially likes pointing to all the animals on the last page.  I thought he'd especially like this version and he does like the slide and find feature.  But the missing last page is such a disappointment that I am returning this book.
B003VANOFY|4.0|These headphones are great, the audio is great, the G-buttons work fine. Most of the issues people complain about are probably sound card related or something because I've had mine for three months and they've worked like a charm. I bought them on the recommendation of a friend and I have not regretted it.     There is one issue I hope Logitech will address. The headset itself when powered on interferes with wireless internet connections for any nearby networks (I'm using a Cisco router). This is remedied by powering off the headset, allowing the other computers to reconnect, then powering the headset on again. I am also pretty sure that changing the wireless router's broadcasting frequency will also correct the issue, but I haven't tried it. It's a minor annoyance but does not diminish the value of the headset. I've gone through countless headsets before this one, including other similarly priced ones, and this one is by far superior.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This movie is for all ages, great color, just a great movie.<br />Was received quickly. Great price and product.Came in original<br />packaging. A must have for classic movie collectors!.
B002ZG98G4|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie.  With the cast of McAdams, Keaton, Goldblum, Ty Burell (Phil from Modern Family) and, of course, Harrison Ford who would think that anything could go wrong, but it just falls flat.  It starts off great as McAdams is hired  as the executive producer of a last place morning network show that supposedly is supposed to rival the glorious Today Show.   She comes in and shakes things up, juggles things around and tries to save the show's ratings by bringing in Harrison Ford who plays a disgruntled former anchorman who longs to do REAL news and not fluffy crap.  The dynamics between Ford and Keaton start strong as the two do battle and insult each other and McAdams tries to contain her disappointment in her idol by finding out that he is an ass.  There are a few tender moments and then it seems like they needed to race to the finish.  Suddenly, the characters all see the light at the same time and the grand finale of the movie just leaves you dry.  There are a few funny moments where McAdams forces the weatherman into Jackass style wacky stunts to boost the ratings, but other than that, you don't really feel much for these characters.  The characters seem to flip-flop from being bastards to suddenly being team players.  The story arc here seemed to collapse in on itself.  It did have hints of Working Girl to it, but McAdams never sits still long enough for you to get to know her character on a personal level.  A valiant attempt, but it needed some more work.

0143034901|4.0|I'm a romance reader so I didn't think I would like this book very much. But I got it for my birthday so I was \\"obligated\\" to give it a try. I read the entire book and liked it. So, give it a chance.
B000000W5L|5.0|I bought a second hand CD, and I am totally satisfied. It is like a brand new one. For the less than a half of its price.
B003YOZNBU|2.0|My first impression, amusingly, was that this reminded me of an old episode of The Wild Wild West TV show.  My second thought was that this was a very dark and ugly movie...and by dark I mean poorly lit!  There were far too many night scenes, half of which I couldn't see what was going on.  Not that there was much to report.  This film took a curiously old fashioned approach to violence being that most of it was suggested or simply done off screen.  I kept thinking, what kind of horror film is this, it's afraid to show violence!  Oh wait, is it a horror film?  Have I been misled?  Is it just another run of the mill western!?  Then I've been duped!<br />As far as the acting goes, it didn't.  With the exception of one actor, everyone else either looked bored or was lost in thought about their  laundry list or getting their car washed (Wes Bentley was gone before I even realized he was in this film!).  Only one actor seemed totally involved and/or committed to his part: Michael Fassbender.  He managed to steal the film (not hard when everyone else was more than willing to part with it).<br /><br />Too tepid, too lackluster, too little too late: not a keeper.
0312330871|3.0|I did not really like this book. It was too wordy and wasn't suspenseful at all with all of the accusations thrown around by those still among the living. It was further ruined by who I actually figured out was the murderer. There was no climax, no fear, nothing. The poem sounded so suspenseful, but didn't deliver.<br /><br />Everyone is so flat. And it's hard to remember who is who, and I felt like I spent half of the book trying to remember who each one was. Sometimes Christie reminds you, but most times she doesn't. I found myself hopelessly flipping through pages of repetitive dialogue to get to the next murder, only to be disappointed it was no big spectacle. I understand that things were more \\"conservative\\" when she wrote it, but I've read more suspenseful things during that time period than this.<br /><br />Needless to say, I will not be picking up another of her novels.
0061122416|1.0|When I bought my Kindle, one of the selling points was that I would be saving money on the many books I buy. However, I am finding over and over again that this is not the case! In fact, many times, as in the case of this book, the cost is higher for the digital version than the actual tangible book. Crazy! Indeed it would be more cost effective to buy the books, get the free shipping because I'm an Amazon Prime member, and then be able to give this book to someone else once I am done with it. With my Kindle version I cannot even pass it on. Hmmm.
0547258305|5.0|This book had a good premise and was always full of action, never lulling. The characters were dynamic and unique. It almost felt like it was two books in one, because it pursued two different story lines within the book. That wasn't a draw back, however, because they were linked together well and flowed beautifully.<br /><br />Worth reading, especially because the romance is not heavy and the main character is so spunky it's very amusing seeing her be girly.<br /><br />A must pick up for a great summer read! Even if most of the book is set deep in the wintry mountains!
0393338827|5.0|This is one of the best books I have recently read. It is very technical, but I am in no way an economist. I was able to understand all of these financial concepts very well. This was thanks in great part to the way the author explained these financial concepts. Even more important this book was a fun read. I haven't been able to put it down. I just started reading it this week and I am almost done with it. It is a real page turner. We all need to understand the fraud that went on prior to the crisis that was done completely with in the confines of the law. It leads me to understand that just because it's legal doesn't make it right. Even more to the point many of the conartists that thought up subprime mortgages should be brought to justice as the frauds they are.
B003DZX44I|4.0|Disney animation is always amazing but in Blu Ray format it's even better! This is a great family film with a fun storyline and soundtrack.

0060936223|5.0|Funny that amazon's rating system when you write a review just happens to be by blue stars (I think they turn yellow after a review is finished, but I digress).  As it turns out, Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe chose a blue star as the enduring symbol of their relationship, and the book is punctuated with a little star throughout as a subtle reminder to the reader of how important the symbol was, and remains to Smith.    The two of them met by complete chance (or, if you believe in fate, then \\"they were meant to be\\") when they were literally just kids.  In \\"just kids\\", Ms. Smith chronicles the couple's financial struggles and slow road to fame and financial independence and (probably,) fortune.   Throughout this period, he especially, and she to a lesser degree, went through some dramatic personal changes.  Mapplethorpe wrestled with his sexuality, and eventually became more attracted to men than women.  Ms. Smith, for her part, had several relationships with others, and even moved to Detroit with her husband, but the relationship between these two \\"kids\\" never waivered.      The book is about a beautiful life long romance (with a small \\"r\\") beautifully written in the Romantic (with a capital \\"R\\") style which so influenced the two artists creatively.     While she never says it directly in the book, the reader gets the sense that neither she nor Mapplethorpe would have become who they became if the two hadn't met.      Guaranteed to bring a tear in your eye, especially toward the end of the book.
0739384198|5.0|I'm not a huge book guy but once I read the first book of the series (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), I was hooked!

B004DK49DW|4.0|Unlike some here, I haven't been a Social D fan since the beginning (I wasn't born until 1978), but I have been a fan since first hearing 'White Light, White Heat, White Trash' around 15 years ago (one of their best in my opinion, a toss-up between it and 'Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell'). It's hard to believe that it's been that long, but I'm guessing that's a common feeling among Mike Ness and Social Distortion fans. I've seen them in concert and they can still rock it out (although I wish I could see them at a venue that's a bit less saccharine and sterile than the House of Blues, but that's my only real option). So all this is to say that, yes, I am and have been a fan of the band. I really can't imagine that changing.<br /><br />All that said, 'Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes' disappointed me, at least initially. Sure, there are some great songs (the cover of Hank Williams' 'Alone and Forsaken' is worth the price of admission on its own), but there seemed to be far too many filler songs for my taste, and even worse, a bunch of them seemed to lack the hard, driving punk sound I'd come to expect from Social Distortion. It didn't really sound like a Social D record at all, I thought to myself, growing increasingly disgusted. Mike, how could you fail your fans so?<br /><br />That's when I had to stop and give myself a kick to the head. Was I really moaning about Social Distortion not conforming to some standard of nonconformity? That's what I'm seeing from a great deal of reviews, people not being able to get past their idea of what \\"punk\\" is supposed to be, how this isn't it and how Mike Ness is just getting old. Ultimately, Mike Ness is still doing what Mike Ness wants to do after 32 years. In some ways, it's a departure from what you've come to expect, but 'Prison Bound' was a departure from 'Mommy's Little Monster' (a departure that continued with their self-titled album and 'Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell').<br /><br />While I can't help not liking all of the songs (and I'm not going to try...I can't think of a single album where there haven't been a few skippable tracks; 'California (Hustle and Flow)' and 'Far Side of Nowhere,' I'm looking at you), for the most part, the album has grown on me by leaps and bounds, with 'Gimme the Sweet and Lowdown,' 'Diamond in the Rough' & 'Still Alive' being my personal favorites (along with the Hank Williams' cover, which to me is the single best track on the album...Mike nails the cover). If your idea of punk music has to do with a certain preconceived sound, Social Distortion isn't your band (and honestly, they never have been). There are plenty of cookie-cutter, color-by-number bands out there that cater to you. If it's about attitude and making honest music that evolves and matures with those making it, then Social D is still Social D.oing to try...I can't think of a single album where there haven't been a few skippable tracks; 'California (Hustle and Flow)' and 'Far Side of Nowhere,' I'm looking at you), for the most part, the album has grown on me by leaps and bounds, with 'Gimme the Sweet and Lowdown,' 'Diamond in the Rough' & 'Still Alive' being my personal favorites (along with the Hank Williams' cover, which to me is the single best track on the album...Mike nails the cover).

B000UX6OHK|2.0|I got this watch for my birthday, and I haven't even had it a year. The face is made of plastic, rather than glass, so it is much more prone to scratches. Also, I was spraying my arm with mosquito spray last summer, and a few drops got on the face. They left a permanent white spot of the face, and that's been frustrating. Now, it has trouble keeping time. Last week it was moving slow, now this week it's moving fast! Not sure if it needs a new battery, but it's only 9 months old, so that seems unlikely. I'm shopping for a new watch, but will stay away from the Swatch brand.
0670022411|3.0|Although I enjoyed this book and read it twice before I put it away.  I find it extremely frustrating when authors begin a series without indication to do so. I had no idea from pre-release or reviews that this was simply an introduction of characters and conflicts that would take at least 2 more books to be resolved. I am of the further opinion that the overly oppressive(protective) nature of the male main character leaves quite a bit to be desired.  I find it implausible that a forward thinkning, exponentially powerful witch would allow herself to be bullied by anyone.  Harkness has Diana acting just like Bella in Twilight over a love interest.  Where is a heroine who insists her partner treat her as an capable and equal partner?

1594202842|1.0|I read the book in 2 sittings. I read many passages outloud & laughed throughout the book. Chua can be very funny, very entertaining. Many of her antics remind me of people/mothers I care about who refuse to consider any alternative, ever. When I first started reading the book, I hoped that perhaps such a person could read this book and recognize the craziness of their behavior, but by the time I finished I was pretty convinced that this book would probably serve to reinforce obsessive and narrow thinking.  For this reason, I do not recommend this book for anyone other than people interested in writing - it is a page turner - and/or psychology.  It took time to realize that Chua is for real. She is magnetic, entertaining, alarming & infuriating - in much the same way Sarah Palin and Charlie Sheen entertain & infuriate.      I was drawn to the book because of the title.  Great title.  It worked. But the title is so much more noble than the contents of the book, I find myself referring to it simply as \\"Chua's book\\", or \\"TigerMomma\\".       What bothers me most about Chua's book is her flagrant disregard for truth and honesty. It makes me mad and sad. She is a most unlikeable narrator.  She lies to her children, admittedly, about all sorts of things.  She exaggerates the risk of stepping foot off a porch, or the dangers lurking beneath the surface of a pond - but somehow neglected to properly \\"train\\" her children not to hop out of moving vehicles.  (She ran over her child's foot.  When I read this passage out loud, the listeners unanimously suggested she probably did it on purpose.  By that time in the book, the reader realizes she is capable of doing just about anything to get her way.)      Chua fabricates lies and backstabs, apparently without any remorse. She is seemingly oblivious to the hurtful consequences of her verbal behavior. There is a passage that describes an interaction during a piano lesson, in which one of the world's great instructors introduces musicselections for an upcoming competition. Chua looks at the Prokofiev sheet music and instantly determines it's too easy, not impressive enough.  But because she doesn't want the teacher (who after all she needs at that moment) to think she is questioning his judgment (which she is), she lies. She states that her daughter's former teacher thought the piece was too easy. The expert apparently shouts her down - and Chua backs down.  This is one of a very few times when Chua's gut-level-self-appointed-expert opinion does not prevail, and she spends paragraphs describing - sniveling, a la Eddie Haskell - about how much she values experts such as this great teacher.  Meanwhile, she misrepresented the opinions of her daughter's former piano teacher to a fellow musician and instructor. To add insult to injury - Chua is disappointed, some months later, when the former piano teacher did not attend the performance at Carnegie Hall.  She describes efforts to maintain a \\"relationship.\\"  What relationship is that exactly?  Most people try to get away from people who use them, then lie about them for personel advantage.    She is ruthless.

B003L20ICE|4.0|I enjoyed this film but in the end I thought the meaning of human sexuality, intimacy and pair bonding within the context of a contemporary marriage, brought into sharp relief by the arrival of Paul (Mark Ruffalo), was left unresolved and unacknowledged. Perhaps that was the director's intent. The fact that Nick and Jules are gay is almost beside the point. The very existence of Paul, an affable stranger with a biological connection to the couple's offspring and no male to male competitive issues, wouldn't make sense in a story involving a heterosexual couple.  The real drama here is Nick and Jules' relationship which includes many of the traits and strains of many long term relationships, straight and gay. They are both attractive, but the sex has been getting workmanlike and probably a bit boring. They are getting on each other's nerves. Kids are growing up and in their own way pushing back and asserting themselves as newly minted adults. Now that her full time childcare duties are winding down, Jules is eager to move on to a new phase of her life with a new business that will allow her to flex her long dormant design skills. Nick (the alpha half and a bit of a control freak) isn't taking to these changes very graciously. Enter, Paul, who is invited into contact with the family by the \\"kids\\". He's a nice guy...attractive (did Ruffalo purposely model Warren Beatty on his Paul) non-needy, owner of his own business who makes a genuine and healthy connection to Joni and Laser. In his private life, he's probably polyamorous...but we really don't know for sure. Jules however is feeling somewhat unappreciated and condescended to by Nick and Paul, now a client of hers, is the perfect tableau on which to project her longing for a lover who listens to her, appreciates her talents and isn't so controlling and self absorbed. Her evolution from consultant to lover is slow, sweet and entirely understandable. The sexual release is explosive. Jules still loves Nick but their 20 or so years of pair bonding intimacy has downgraded their sexual passion and therefore, in turn, their relationship. Sound familiar? After being \\"discovered\\" by Nick and the recriminations begin to fly Jules shouts \\"Do you even find me attractive anymore?\\"  By this point I though the film was really covering some really important ground but then.... it doesn't quite know where to go. After beautifully exposing the real challenges and contradictions of monogamy in long term relationships and the need for couples to take a hard look at how their love life may be undergoing atrophy, the ensuing \\"crisis\\" is wasted with a brief heartfelt but lame \\"marriage is hard\\" speech from Jules and rather selfish tossing away of Paul,halfheartedly re-branded as some sort of villain by the de-facto family \\"bad cop\\" Nick. Are we to asssume that everyone else agrees or is Nick just being the same \\"old\\" Nick and making everyone elses decisions for them....or do they ALL want Paul (who they invited to this gig in the first place) to disappear?      As for Paul, contact with this family has ignited a desire for a real pair bonding relationship with loving partner and much to his surprise, he falls for Jules...who really, I think, just needed a passionate fling (with the ever controlling Nick out of the picture) to help her re-find her inner self and begin building a better relationship with Nick. This is life! We don't always like the consequences. Paul goes away (I guess) somewhat heartbroken (again....I guess), and we are (or at least I was) left hoping he'd get over it and, some day have \\"the kids\\" back to his restaurant for some braised lamb shanks and a good bottle of wine while the moms are off on vacation, making love in some hotel room in Paris.  In the end...I think, Paul has done this family a great service but alas...it's not really acknowledged by the filmmakers (or characters). Make up your own mind.
1591843790|2.0|Guy Kawasaki is a most successful guy and wants to share the secrets of his success with you. However, this reader has seen most of it before, having read Dale Carnegie's 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' many moons ago.     For me the only chapters which had relatively new material were the ones on how to use social media such as Facebook, Twitter and of course Linked-In. The rest was rather yawn making and by the end I was totally sick of the word Enchantment as it's sprinkled ad nauseum throughout the text.     To me, most of the content of this book (and to be fair this also applies to most books on how to get ahead in business) is just plain common sense. Believe whole heartedly in the product or service you're involved with; be nice to people - especially your customers, your staff and your boss; be likeable; be honest and trustworthy in all you do. Achieve all these things and employ the right tools to do the job and the world is your oyster.     I'm probably the wrong person to review this book as I've seen it all before, hence my lowly two stars. Someone starting out in business or wanting to harness social media more effectively will probably avidly devour everything Kawasaki has to say and give it a high five.    Update: I was on of the 2,000 or so AllTop bloggers who took Guy up on his offer of a review copy of this book. In the weeks leading up to the book's launch I had many emails purportedly from Guy telling me how wonderfully the launch was going and urging me to write up my review.    Just after the launch Guy was interviewed by Social Media Examiner and the 2,000 reviewers was cited as a marvellous way to market via social media. This shows the cynical way in which Guy was using the members of the Alltop site for his own gain. Not very enchanting at all. Note I'd written my review before I found this out and it reinforces my my original view of the book.

Throw in the rock n roll and what a ride.  thank you sixx for having the guts and courage to tell your story.
B004NIFSRA|5.0|I could barely bring myself to read the cover, as it was long and boring with words but no pictures.  Inside the book each page is beautifully illustrated with descriptions about the top 200 things that men think about apart from sex.  If I were to brainstorm my own ideas for this book I think I would have come up with pretty much the same thing.  Each page captured my attention and I could barely wait to see the end of the book... because as a modern man I have only a three second attention span, which is about how long it took to go thru the book, and I was eager to get back to things that men think about NOT apart from sex.  I think this was the perfect number of pages for a book like this.  I think if there were say 250 pages then I would have lost interest before reaching the end of this book.    Other merits include an eye-catching yellow star-like shape in the upper corner of the cover which promises amazing truths inside.  The book does not disappoint.    The book is the perfect size for a large pocket so that I can carry it with me for those infrequent times when I ponder whether men like me think about something apart from sex.  I can simply pull the book out of my pocket and then have probably already forgotten why I even pulled the book from my pocket as my mind is already thinking once again about sex, and then put it back in my pocket for next time.  Ocassionally I'll wonder why this strange book is in my pocket and then I'll look at it and see by the bolded letters on the cover that it has something to do with a MAN and then something to do with... oh yeah, SEX. With some other probably irellevant words in between.
B0041KKYDI|4.0|The movie was done very well, with beautiful cinematography and great acting. However, it is a very limited story, which causes it to be relatively boring. Besides Franco, the actors with the most face time are probably the ants. There just isn't enough meat on the bone. While this may have harmed the integrity of the movie, I would have preferred longer more in-depth flash backs or maybe more time at the beginning of the movie to get to know the main and only character. They do achieve their goal though, and triumphant ending of him cutting his arm off and being helicoptered to safety were very strong. I admit I had a tear in my eye when the credits rolled. So, I don't advise buying this movie, but it is a great rental if you don't mind the slowness and slight gore at the end.

This is the great exception, and well worth hearing. See the videos on YouTube as well, from the original MTV video to the Glastonbury concert 15 years later. Wow.

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Saw this movie when I was 8 or 9 years old in theaters and ever since then I was hooked. This movie receives alot of flack mostly because of it's success. This is probably the most romantic movie ever made. It has a great love story, and it has a great action sequence in the realism of the sinking of Titanic. If anything, at least watch the moving for the sinking sequence. The reason they have a love story in the movie is so that it will tug at our hearts more when the sinking and death starts taking place. Its easier to feel the kind of pain the women who had to leave their husbands behind, when you see the main characters you have grown to love in the same situation. Every rendition of Titanic, with exception to A Night to Remember, has had some kind of love story, and if you want a successful movie, you have to have a plot, not just a documentary.    Don't listen to anyone who downs on this movie because I have seen far worse such as Gone with the Wind, which is both racist and historically inaccurate, if people are going to fawn over a movie like that, then what is wrong with Titanic? Nothing, most people hate it because of how much hype surrounded it.    Titanic is the big romance flick of our generation the way movies like Gone with the Wind and Casablanca were 60-70 years ago. It is a true classic and 40 years from now, people are going to look back at this movie the same way society looks back at old movies, even the worst, as great films.    As for the dvd features, I have the 3 disc version which includes a 10 minute deep sea dive, and 45 minutes worth of deleted scenes. If you decide to buy Titanic, shell out more for the 3 disc 2005 version because the 2008 2 Disc 10th Anniversary edition, is basically the first 2 discs of the Collector's edition minus the most interesting features (deleted scenes). I plan to see this movie when it is rereleased in theaters next year, and I hope they put it out on blu ray soon or make another, more spectacular dvd release that beats the 3 disc version.    I also suggest getting Ghosts of the Abyss as a great companion to this, its basically an even longer more recent (2002) deep sea dive to Titanic.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved the many narrators, and was disappointed each time the story shifted to a different point of view, only to become captivated by each new point of view.  The only exceptionally boring narrator was Daenerys -- perhaps because she is far from the rest of the action, perhaps because I found her Stockholm Syndrome tedious.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is the first 5 star book I have happened across in years.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"A Game of Thrones\\" in much the same way as I enjoyed the first two installments in Sarah Monette's \\"Melusine\\" series: it is dark, complex, intriguing, and successful in its use of multiple narrators.

B0013FDM7E|3.0|This film starts out with great promise, with WS as a lone man in a world of chaos.  He is hunting, through the streets of Manhattan, for food and uninfected humans, all the while working on a vaccine for the bio-engineered virus that has more of less destroyed humanity.  WS is convincing as an anguished, intelligent man, who is struggling with his isolation, though his dog is a vital companion.  With flashbacks and preserved video cuts, past history becomes clear:  WS was an army scientist who is the only person to understand the vaccine, which is what makes him immune to the disease of the savages who come out at night.  He has lost his family, understands what has happened to the world and what needs to be done, and has a charismatic strength of character.<br /><br />So far so good.  You see WS suffer and think as well as act with the decisiveness you would expect from a hero.  There are many excellent details, such as the relationship with his dog or his golfing off the wing of a grounded jet fighter.  It is vivid and beautiful, completely believable.<br /><br />However, once the night bad guys come to the fore, the film begins to falter.  First, the night baddies are simply not well executed technically:  they don't look real, so you can't believe in them; as one reviewer noted, they look too much like video game characters.  We expect better in computer animation, I'm sorry.  Second, from an introspective survivor film, you get grotesquely violent action.  Not only is the plot unrealistic - the baddies have not discovered him until the night he is rescued by an immune woman and then they come in force - but the action is kind of ridiculous:  the baddies seem invulnerable, though they have lost their human intelligence as they transformed into hairless half-dogs and behave as if they have rabies.  They are seeking human flesh and seem to have some kind of hive mind, like an insect society, but none of the promising threads are developed into plot and theme.  There is not even enough to enable the thoughtful viewer to connect the dots, which is another indispensable component to great scifi.<br /><br />That being said, I am quite a sucker for these end-of-humanity films.  This one got me to believe, at least for the first half.  It is a mistake to have made it into an action film in the end, though WS is a good action hero.  WS' role is more dramatic than his usual roles, more complex as a character and not at all happygolucky as we expect of the fresh prince.  He is a good actor and did well here, but the script and direction  take it over the top.<br /><br />Recommended, but not with much enthusiasm.ere is not even enough to enable the thoughtful viewer to connect the dots, which is another indispensable component to great scifi.<br /><br />That being said, I am quite a sucker for these end-of-humanity films.

0307593495|5.0|Readers should undoubtedly rejoice in A Troubled Man, which marks the return of Henning Mankell's Swedish policeman Kurt Wallander.  In this book Wallander must solve the reasons for the disappearance of Hakon and Louise von Enke, future in-laws of his daughter Linda and father to his new granddaughter, Klara.  Were they murdered, or did they voluntarily disappear?  The story is, as one character put it, not what it seems.<br /><br />Against this background, Kurt Wallander must deal with his entry into senescence with its health, memory, and loneliness problems, the psychological disintegration of Mona, his ex-wife, being reunited with an old flame under sad circumstances, and coping with the persistent demands and bitchery of Linda, his daughter.  This reader really rooted for something good, some joy to come into Wallander's life in the narrative.<br /><br />In solving the mystery, Wallander finds that events of the Cold War, Swedish politics, and the skeletons from familial closets may possibly continue to inform the present.  In the Faulknerian sense, \\"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\\"  His Odyssey in finding a solution takes him to Stockholm, then Copenhagen, then Riga, then Berlin; with assorted sinister figures who might or might not have been involved in the happenings which cumulate in a surprise ending,<br /><br />A word of caution: this Wallander book is rather downbeat; and persons in a melancholy mood might defer reading it until times are happier.  Still, it is a compelling read, and worthy of five stars.
1400052173|3.0|I bought the book on the basis of the overwhelming positive reviews... and can't understand how it got so many positive reviews now that I have read the book. It is thorough for sure, and mildly interesting, but certainly not fasciniating.  I am a scientist, and don't work directly with HeLa cells, but hear about them from time to time; a one-page brief history would be enough to satisfy my curiosity about where the cells came from. Also, I just can't get caught up in the idea that the taking and reproduction of these cells without the family's permission is a huge scandal.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Bravo, Clint Eastwood, you really outdid yourself on making this movie.  Also, bravo to Matt Damon for not pigeonholing himself into roles but instead flexing his acting versatility every chance he gets.  I just got done watching him as Tina Fey's pilot boyfriend on 30 ROCK and the Texas Ranger in TRUE GRIT.  You would be hard pressed to tell any of these roles were the same actor!<br /><br />This film has an incredible opening, one I can see again and again.  A French female tv broadcaster is on vacation at a beach paradise on the Indian Ocean.  While she is shopping at the stalls, the tsunami which erupted from that ocean in 2004 crashes towards her.  She struggles for her life in the water but a car hits in the water and she dies and starts to cross over.  This, however, is one of those deaths where she is subsequently brought back with life guard techniques.  Yet she now is forever drawn back to that transition point.  Hers is just one of three stories but what a bang up opening to this film.<br /><br />There are two other stories.  Matt Damon is a reluctant psychic located in San Francisco.  He is the real deal unlike just about everyone else in the field.  The reason he doesn't want to do it is that it is absolutely ruinous to one's personal life as it obliterates the distance needed to carry on personal relationships.  It is hard to romance someone when you can see her entire life with just one touch. He has such an encounter with a would-be girlfriend played by Bryce Dallas Howard.<br /><br />Finally, there is a boy who loses his twin brother in a fatal collision.  He desperately wants to get in touch with his brother.  His life is a mess because after his brother's death he is removed from his mother and put into foster care. (Although, one evidently can get far better foster care families in the UK than here in the US.) It was interesting for me to see that the boy uses a computer with internet connection as his lifeline in almost every situation.  The other characters are too old for them to have been raised with a connected computer since earliest childhood.  However, with the newest generation coming up, it as natural as breathing to use it everyday for everything.<br /><br />All three of these people will ultimately come together in London.  This too works very well.  It is just an astonishing piece of filmmaking and I consider it at the very top of Eastwood's directing efforts.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B003YHSE7W|1.0|Iron Man 2 is ridiculously stupid movie. So what was good about the movie? I did like the way 2 of the iron men suits were moving and the special effects. I have a feeling that Scarlett had a significant role in this movie. As a sexy, unbeatable agent. Lol I had seen what Hollywood did to her moves, she didn't blink even once(script don't allow that because in Hollywood we are the heroes and we set the rules. And rules are:America as a world dominator, world saviour,world's best bla bla bla they have the sexiest women on earth with no American descent in real life, plastic surgery, lots of make up, even more added sexiness with special effects to already pretty women and they should know at least 9 languages, marshall arts,be special agents and they should in the end win over the bad guys easily, whatever, you name it). And her moves so ummm ''very realistic''. I swear when I saw her moves in the air and all that, I was looking for defects in the movie like a cable or cord around her waist that allowed her to move freely. I don't do that usually. It was the first time that I recall when I was laughing over all these things. And then she just had to train all her moves and repeat them until it goes flawlessly. And remember real American hero kicks ass and does not blink and it all shall be paced within 1 minute. LOL. What next? Downey is not one of my favorite characters. In the first Iron man he was a lot better. But in Iron Man 2 he is so arrogant and boring I was hoping for a bad guys to kick his ***. His relationship with his lover is looking cheap, similar to other movies, where if it worked in one movie, the other ten movies will destroy it by copying all the things that once made it fun to watch. And which we loved. This movie has money, special effects but no story whatsoever, plot is terrible. Some actors could have been better. If there should be Iron Man 3, I wish it to be something set in the far far future where it has nothing to do with Downey and previous suits or actors. Like as if it is another suit by design with other upgrades. And please no rubbish. Special effects put here and there and everywhere will not go well with a bad story and characters which some of us can't and don't want to see anymore. And for the last. It is very typical of Hollywood to show off Russians like that. And who was that actor who played Russian? Mickey Rourke. I didn't like nothing about what they've done. It's just a Hollywood standards. Directors get paid, people eat this rubbish and so they think they are the most supreme race in the world? Oh please. When will there be done a real good movie by Hollywood that will not include all this ****? I'm sick and tired of all the same things.
B001DCQI9Q|5.0|Many of my friends, Haydn-wise, tend to run with the period practice wolfpack. The mere mention of this set is enough to make them bristle up and growl . . . . Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.<br /><br />There's a deep affinity between Haydn and Beethoven. Herbie was a great interpreter of the latter. In the early 1980s, just before the fissure opened up between himself and the Berlin Phil, he measured himself against the Paris and London symphonies. \\"One gentleman's tribute to another\\" is an apt description of this set.<br /><br />Firstly, the recording is superlative. The once-off Herbie Gold reissue of 94 & 101 demonstrated that further improvement is possible but the current remastering is satisfactory. The bass line is strong. There is little evidence of the 'digital sheen' in the treble. It is far more listenable than its counterparts in the Bruckner set.<br /><br />To the interpretations themselves. Sure, there is weight here but it's not onerous. Where else will one find a better Miracle (their &eacute;lan in the first movement is phenomenal) or Drum Roll (one could listen to the last movement ten times over)? The London was one of Herbie's war-horses and this performance is his best (his pacing is unerring in the outer movements - one is left in no doubt as to the real climax of each). The Berlin Phil are at their luminous best; they tear into the symphonies as if their lives depend upon it.  Above all, their musicianship is showcased: they listen attentively to one another; the solos are magisterially performed and their enjoyment is self-evident (as an aside, what orchestra does not like playing Haydn?).<br /><br />The minuets are on the slow side at times but they're never funereal. One can live with them<br /><br />If you believe that Haydn is a great symphonist and a premier orchestra can do him justice cosmically, this set is for you. This survey came with the imprimatur of H C Robbins Landon; his enthusiasm is understandable. It'll be a sad day if Haydn's symphonies become the sole preserve of HIP ensembles or their faux-equivalents among modern-day orchestras (such as Rattle and Abbado).<br /><br />Auden once commented that alienation from the collective is always a duty.<br /><br />Here's an opportunity to raise the Jolly Roger.come the sole preserve of HIP ensembles or their faux-equivalents among modern-day orchestras (such as Rattle and Abbado).<br /><br />Auden once commented that alienation from the collective is always a duty.<br /><br />Here's an opportunity to raise the Jolly Roger.

B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Can I just say that I had no interest in taking my daughter to see this movie until a friend told me that it was great. I really haven't liked Disney's last few animated films and wouldn't even let my 4 1/2-year-old daughter see The Princess and the Frog, but this movie was fabulous.  The music is GREAT, there is nothing objectionable in it, the animation is great, and the story is very cute.  I couldn't help but to pre-order this movie for my daughter (and myself) because she has talked about it ever since we saw it.  I actually can't wait until it gets here so I can watch it again! Great movie that I know we will enjoy for years and years.  I might even go so far as to say that it might be my second favorite after Beauty and the Beast!

0061450162|3.0|This book was my introduction to Neil Gaiman as I've had a few friends rave about his work and so was curious to read some. I found this and one other book (Coraline) in a box and decided to read this one first.   Eh, I can't really say I enjoyed it. It took me a while to get through it, mostly because quite a few stories were either hard to digest, hard to follow, or boring. There were a few gems that kept me interested, but that's about all I can say for this book. After reading a few other reviews I think I will read another of Neil Gaiman's books, preferably a novel, before I give up on him.
0670022411|4.0|I enjoyed the book immensely.  Interesting views on the exploration of knowledge, time and history in a world filled with magical, powerful people with secrets to keep. I like how some vampires in this story, with their long life span, have time to study and to live a variety of useful, creative lives over a long period in which they can explore the world. The witches and demons were interesting, too.  There were a lot of things left undone so it was not a complete story in the first book.  However, I look forward to learning more about these fascinating characters in the next book.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Add me to the crowd of fans who love this album.  I bought it after seeing Mumford & Sons perform on the Grammy Show.  Pure audio energy!  Most of the cuts on this disk are listenable, but the driving rhythm and dark lyrics of \\"The Cave\\" make that song a real standout.<br /><br /> Wonderful album well worth buying.
0142501123|5.0|Got this at the library tonight and read it at bedtime to my 3 1/2 year old boy. It was so fun! Great fun story and great word rhythm. I loved reading it. Beautiful illustrations. Also, he is a little scared of witches so this seemed to put him at ease with them because this witch is not scary.
B002WY65W4|5.0|When people ask me what this movie is about, all you can really say is that it's just the guys on the cover in a world full of zombies. People may wonder how a day-in-the-life-of zombie movie could get five stars from me but it really comes from the humor of the movie. The characters each have something they are living for and they all have their unique personalities which pushes the movie forward and keeps you laughing the whole time!

B004EBT5CU|2.0|I listened to this album based upon all the \\"soulful\\" hype and rave reviews this album received.  She is a talented artist but I was not impressed by this album.  I did enjoy He Won't Go, Love Song, Someone Like You and, to a lesser extent, Take It All.  The band backing her is more than adequate.  I'm just not that into her sound.  She reminds me of a female John Legend... another artist loved by many whom I can take or leave, usually the latter.  Actually, I am inclined to see Adele as the talented sound-child of John Legend and Bonnie Raitt.    This album is just not for me.  I will get my soul elsewhere.
B00428CPUY|5.0|I've got all 3 of the Clapton CrossRoads DVD sets. It just keeps getting better and better. You can tell that by this time around the musicians are getting to know each other better and there appears to be more collaboration, and a relaxed friendliness in the behind-the-scenes footage. Bill Murray is fantastic as ever. It was especially nice to see musicians like Robert Cray, Hubert Sumlin and Johnny Winter.  The Thrill is Gone is still a show stopper, this time with most of the players up for cameo appearances along side the great Mr. B.B. King.

B003VANOFY|5.0|The G930 is a quality product that I would recommend to any user.  The sound is amazing and it is light and easy to wear.  The 7.1 surround sound of the G930 is phenomenal... sounds like the people are talking inside the same room when using vent / mumble etc.  So many great features and a really nice looking, easy to use UI.    Really makes Creative's poorly designed, double the price World of Warcraft headset bow it's head in shame!!!      Purchasing through Amazon's Market Place (Electronica Direct) was great value and super efficient too.  Product was shipped from US and delivered to Australia in 10 days... FANTASTIC SERVICE!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Witches, vampires and daemons forge an unlikely alliance in this adult twist on the Twilight trilogy.  It's very romance-y, with some history, some genetic biology and a little bit of Buffy the Vampire Slayer thrown in for good measure.  Not a huge drain on your gray matter, but generally entertaining.  It gets three stars and not four because the ending is highly unsatisfying -- as if the author had wanted to write a 750 page book, but the publisher decided to cut the book in half and get a head start on the sequel.  Almost every loose end remains untied and if you care at all about what happens to the characters, you'll need to wait for book No. 2!

B000F3T3E6|5.0|Handel - Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno is a recording under the direction of Emanuelle Haim who leads the Le Concert D'Astree on this EMI recording from 2007. Anthony Hicks has written the liner-notes which are intersting and informative. The lyrics are available in French, German, Italian and English. The booklet also contains photographs of the performers from the time of the recording. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
B0036EH3WK|4.0|First 4 seasons are absolutly fantastic.  The 5th season is still alright but not as good.  The last season is not very good at all.  Not sure what happened to the writers on the last season but what a complete waste on some of the directions they took and how they tried to pull it off.  Just doesn't work.  They needed to focus more on the mythology and giving answers and less time on squirrel Claire.  How they explained the whispers felt like a 6 year let down.  Also, the last season needed more of Desmond!  The series is worth it for the first 4 seasons alone though.
0670022411|5.0|Harkness combines so much history woven into an accessible story making you wish her characters were real. She knows her wine so for any oenophiles out there, that alone is entertaining. This is much more mature than the Twilight series (which I also loved) and her ability to bring history within arm's reach is commendable. The story of family, friendship and love is timeless, yet not sugar coated. Families bicker and each character comes to life in vivid detail, including a house. I am on the edge of my seat for the next installment. For the reviewer who was so upset about not realizing the book would have future installments, it sounds like it is time to lose some negativity, for if one wants to keep reading after turning the last page, then Harkness has succeeded in capturing your imagination! A true joy. Thank you!

1594202559|5.0|I tell my kids there are two ways to make money in this world.  The hard way is to develop a new product or service that adds to the well-being of the world, like Bill Gates or Henry Ford.  The easy way is to take advantage of the stupidity of government.<br /><br />Genius is a sometimes thing, but stupidity is a constant.  You just have to keep your eyes open.  The majority of the stories that Mallaby tells so well have to do with pricing anomalies resulting from government policy.  Currency pegs that no longer made sense; restrictions on short selling; the regulations that allowed banks to equate AAA rated mortgage debt with treasury bonds in terms of risk; the sudden reversals, such as the ban on short selling in 2008.  The policy trap that virtually required the government to bail out the banks that were too big to fail, saving them from their own stupidity.<br /><br />I hope my kids are geniuses, but I will be satisfied if they can feed themselves and their families.  I will encourage them to look for stupid things that governments do and to line up at the trough.  If they do turn out to be bona fide geniuses, then I would encourage them to emulate the real heroes of Mallaby's opus, the guys like Jim Simon and Julian Robertson who are able to use pure intellect to capitalize on pricing anomalies left by other investors<br /><br />Regulation is an arena in which government stupidity is on constant display.  The banks had been regulated since the Glass-Steagall act of 1933.  Prior to deregulation the banks were pretty clever about getting around it, then they were clever at manipulating the political process to have it removed, and clever once again at circumventing whatever restrictions were still imposed on them.  Campaign finance reform, which might have restricted the flow of Wall Street money to members of Congress who oversaw the financial sector, was a predictable fiasco, actually designed by the legislators to fail.<br /><br />Mallaby argues that the hedge funds are better off largely left unregulated.  While in an ideal world this may not be totally true, given the sad history of regulation and regulators, I am sure he is right.<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted that Mallaby tells his story by choosing a select group of successful hedge fund operators.  I believe that this selection works well.  It shows the great variety of strategies used by hedge funds, and illustrates the fact that there would be no form of regulation that would be anywhere nearly applicable to all of them.  He concludes in saying that the hedge funds today fill the role that was once played by the privately held merchant banks such as Lehman Brothers and Solomon, rapidly and efficiently deploying private capital to the benefit of both society and the capitalists.  I agree with his conclusion.eft unregulated.  While in an ideal world this may not be totally true, given the sad history of regulation and regulators, I am sure he is right.

0316098337|5.0|Warning: the following review may include some spoilers.     Room is a fascinating, and heart-wrenching novel by Emma Donoghue. The novel is narrated by Jack, a five year old boy who was born in raised in an 11 by 11 foot room. Donoghue's choice to make Jack the narrator, allows the reader to experience this, at times, disturbing novel through Jack's young perspective. Jack is a clever, energetic, and innocent narrator. The reader experiences \\"Room\\" through Jack's eyes; As Shannon said in her review, Jack tends to anthropomorphize everything in \\"Room\\". Donoghue illustrates Jack's feelings towards the things in \\"Room\\" by writing words like \\"Door Wall\\" and \\"Bed\\" with capitals. He shares the room with his \\"Ma\\" who was brought to \\"Room\\" when she was 19 years old, and who has been held prisoner there for 7 years. \\"Ma\\" was brought there by a man that Jack refers to as \\"Old Nick\\" and she is constantly abused and raped. Jack has never seen or known the outside world. He believes that outside the walls of \\"Room\\" there is \\"Outer Space\\" and that everything that he sees on TV exists solely in TV. Jack's love and affection for \\"Room\\" is juxtaposed with his \\"Ma's\\" frustration and loathing of it. When \\"Ma\\" tries to tell Jack about the world outside of \\"Room\\", she says, \\"Room's only a tiny stinky piece of it\\". Donoghue has Jack fiercely defend his beloved \\"Room\\" when she writes in reply \\" 'Room's not stinky.' I'm nearly growling.\\" Jack has a hard time processing the concept of an outside world with real people and things that he has never experienced. In response to his mother's story of her life outside of \\"Room\\", Jack wonders, \\"Why she's pretending like this, is it a game I don't know?\\" Readers will feel compelled to keep reading to discover what happens to \\"Ma\\" and Jack.    Besides the disturbing aspects of rape, abuse, and captivation, the novel also illustrates the strong bond between mother and child. Both Jack and \\"Ma\\" love each other tremendously and are extremely protective of one another. His mother's ingenuity and love is shown through her creative ways of trying to give Jack a normal life. Ma develops countless of games for them to play together, she reads him books, tells him stories, and she develops a fitness routine for them. Their close relationship and fierce love for one another warmed my body from top to bottom.     I feel that this novel would be a valuable book to teach in schools. However, because of the sensitive subject matter I would gear it towards 11th or 12th graders. I would also discuss the novel with my students beforehand and gauge their reactions. This novel could be taught in many ways. One of the most interesting things to look at in the novel is perspective. Readers are given a unique perspective through Jack. I think that students could use \\"Room\\" to understand how important perspective is in a novel. We could discuss how the novel would be different if it was from \\"Ma's\\" perspective or from \\"Old Nick's\\". In addition, I could have students write the same short story twice from two different perspectives. The novel could also be be used to have discussions about the power of relationships, survival instincts, adaptation to new environments, freedom/imprisonment, and our need for contact with other humans. I could also ask students to write a short piece describing how they would feel in the position of one of the main characters. I think that this novel would definitely draw students in and encourage them to keep reading.    Overall, I really enjoyed this novel yet I felt myself frightened many times for the safety of \\"Ma\\" and especially for Jack.

B002ZG98FU|3.0|\\"Morning Glory\\" aspires to be the movie equivalent of a morning latte (a perky, frothy concoction), but it more closely resembles a shaken-up can of diet soda, as once all the fizz has dissolved, there is not much left to enjoy other than a few empty calories.  The heroine, Becky Fuller (a dynamic Rachel McAdams) is an ambitious young producer surprisingly given the opportunity to resurrect the long-ailing, 40-year old network morning news program, \\"Daybreak.\\"  With cantankerous new co-anchor Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) to constantly babysit, relentlessly upbeat Becky (she's practically a human espresso machine) has her hands full reviving \\"Daybreak\\" while still trying to make time to fulfill other basic needs in her high-pressure, workaholic lifestyle.     All in all, \\"Morning Glory\\" initially made me wonder if it could be a stellar 21st Century equivalent of \\"I'll take on New York and win big\\" movies like 1987's \\"Secret of My Success and 1988's \\"Working Girl.\\"  The only problem is that this movie's minimal storyline probably would have worked better as an above-average TV movie rather than an inflated big-screen spotlight vehicle for Ms. McAdams.  Admirably, she performs just as well as other talented actresses, like Anne Hathaway, Kate Hudson, and Reese Witherspoon would have done with the same role.  Beyond McAdams, her best able support comes from Diane Keaton, as peppy (at least, on-air) co-anchor Colleen Peck.  Keaton has done better work elsewhere, but here she is spot on as an aging yet spry morning news personality willing to try almost anything to keep her jeopardized program afloat.  Further, John Pankow (as Becky's assistant), Jeff Goldblum (as her world-weary division chief), and Patti D'Arbanville (as Becky's mom) add some nice supporting performances.  Patrick Wilson, as Adam (Becky's love interest), does the best he can with a pretty clichéd role, but he is unable to add much glimmer to the tired plot.    Unfortunately, even less could be said forco-lead Harrison Ford, who, in an all-too-ironic parallel to his grouchy on-screen alter ego, appears to know he is slumming here and his coasting performance clearly pays for it.  It is not all Ford's fault, as he was simply miscast probably for star power purposes.  Even cameos by real television anchors and an \\"interview\\" with Condoleeza Rice can't provide Ford with the necessary credibility to make viewers visualize his character as being up there with Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw.  The film instead really needed someone like Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, or William Shatner, who could have gleefully contributed the funny zip, zeal, or quirkiness to bring a pompous jerk like Pomeroy truly to life (after all, this movie is supposed to be a sparkly romantic comedy). Even another retread of the late Ted Knight's bombastic, self-important Ted Baxter persona would have likely worked here.    The problems with \\"Morning Glory\\" can readily be captured by its underwhelming climax (during which Becky must choose between a revitalized \\"Daybreak\\" and another network's dream job) by demonstrating that some terrific little moments end up lost in a clichéd-driven finale.  If this flimsy script had been sent in for needed repairs early on, \\"Morning Glory\\" may well have been easily salvageable.  Otherwise, for Rachel McAdams fans, one should enjoy it as a preview of better works from her down the road.    Rating: 6.5/10 (Watchable and undemanding, probably a nice date night choice).    P.S.  Very little is provided on the special features, including only one deleted scene.  It only reinforces my suspicion that there wasn't much plot here to begin with.
B000UR9T8W|3.0|I got this as a Valentines Day gift for my fiance he LOVES spiderman. However the 2nd disc wasn't packaged right & was loose inside the case resulting in scratches! So of course it doesn't play right. Was a bit disappointed.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|To understand truly how great this film is you should watch the original TV series Neon Genesis Evangelion which this Tetralogy is based on. The differences and improvements to the characters may seem subtle, but in a 2 hour film those differences are magnified compared to a 26 episode series which had a lot of time to develop characters.<br /><br />That being said the animation, CG, lighting, etc are incredible and I can't remember seeing anime action look so incredible in a long time. I watched the English subtitled version of this film and voice acting and subtitles where fine, don't know about the English dub but the voice actors are supposed to be the same from the TV series so they probably did a fine job.<br /><br />Also in case you don't know this is the 2nd out of 4 films, so if you haven't seen the 1st film you will be lost and be prepared to want more once the film is over. This film I will recommend to anyone regardless of a preference to anime or not, this is a great sci-fi, action, and drama mixed together. I will make my friend who was angry by the ending that the TV series left us with watch this because it improves and clarifies the story the second time around.<br /><br />The TV series in the end failed to tie everything together, still the TV series ranks in my Top 5 TV series ever. I can only hope the films complete the story. But judging by the first 2 films I would have to say they are right on track.
0091939526|3.0|This is a fascinating book to read.  I learned a lot from Timothy Ferris' research.  I believe his advice on exercise is very helpful.  I  am still learning how to use a kettlebell.  However, I am finding out that the diet he recommends, while initially resulting in weight loss, is eventually like every other diet.  It results in regaining the lost weight, actually quite rapidly.  I found the diet impossible to follow after about two weeks.  I think the gas and the cravings did me in, I just couldn't face another egg breakfast.  That said , I found a lot of information in the book very helpful.

The eerie/quirky music matched the artistic renderings of the sometimes lovable characters and created the perfect atmosphere for each scene in the game. Every weekend we looked forward to having another go at seeing where the story would lead us.  We were not disappointed by any aspect of the game.  It's amazing that all of what you see in this game is hand drawn.
B00447RA9Y|5.0|This is the sort of thing that once I saw, I knew I would value having it fifty years from now.  As a filmmaker, Inception was glorious to see - it is an example of how good a movie can be.  Everything about this movie meshed, especially the original score.  This score did exactly what any film score should: heighten the emotional intensity, and make itself inseparable from the film: the movie would not be nearly the same without this music, and never will I hear this music and not be transported back to the high of the film.       The product sounds amazing, and this is on the cheap turntable I have here at college - I can't wait to play this on my system back home.  You'll feel the music more than you've ever felt it before.
B002JCSRKC|5.0|LOVE these boots! I ordered the same size I wear in all my crocs (and other shoes).  They fit well on my calf's ( about 13.5 inches where the boot comes to), big enough I can tuck in a pair of skinny jeans.  My complaints would be they make my feet rather sweaty and they are kind of stiff to walk in (no more than regular rain boots). I did however wear them during a 10 hour shift at work (I am on my feet all day) and my feet felt good after work.  If I had an unlimited budget, I would get them in every color!!
B00007M5CO|5.0|I was in Argentina surrounded by tango. Liked (somewhat) the traditional recordings with Gardel, Triollio, etc.  We were in a restaurant/tango club in Mendoza and while waiting for the live music, they were playing this.  I went up to the bar and asked what it was. Went on my iPod to Amazon, ordered it, and it was waiting for me when we got home.<br />You can get your tango yayas in an updated way, lots of bass and heavy beat and electronics, interesting interplays of riffs and instruments.
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|I saw the TV show and wasn't sure if they were going to live up to the expectations that they were setting for themselves and they certainly have exceeded them! With all of the \\"boy band\\" fever lately, it's hard not to like Big Time Rush. They look good, and they sound good. They have great harmonies and great lyrics. I am a \\"boy band\\" enthusiast so had very high expectations for this album, hoping it would be like Nsync, Backstreet Boys and other, and they were much like them. At times their harmonies are exceptional, like in Nothing Even Matters, and Count on You. Sometimes, like in Oh Yeah, I felt like it was one sided, and more of a solo song. Overall though, the rock pop flare of the whole album was great! My favorite song is Worldwide, but all of them are great. Can't wait to hear more from them!

031261246X|4.0|*Rating is 3.5*<br /><br />Mark Russinovich works at Microsoft in one of the senior-most technical positions. Considering the background of the author, the premise of Zero Day becomes even more compelling.<br /><br />Zero Day has a thrilling start. Several seemingly unrelated incidents take place all over the world, all involving computer failures. The controls of a British Airways flight fails. So do the computers in a highly reputed firm based in NYC. A glitch in the computer databases in various hospitals causes many patients to die, due to wrong administration of medicines. Jeff Aiken, who used to previously work for the Government, starts to see a pattern in these incidents. What emerges is more deadly than anyone could imagine. It's up to Jeff to stop the impending disaster before all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Zero Day involves a very realistic portrayal of cyber-terrorism. It's disturbing and terrifying since it's so real; and it's scarier because of the author's knowledge and background. You can't really discount the scenario presented in Zero Day - the things described in the book can certainly happen. Ever since 9/11 attacks , there has been increasing paranoia in the world. Terrorism has expanded and with advancement in technology, the threat has increased further. Taking into account how depended we've become on computers and internet, the book's premise is only too real. If someone was to launch an attack via the internet, the effects can be enormous and more horrifying than what any one of us can imagine.<br /><br />Zero Day is a fast-paced, heart-stopping thriller. I was unable to put the book down. The book compels you to ask - \\"What if?\\" This thought-provoking thriller, packed with action, will keep you reading late into the night. I instantly connected with Jeff. All through the book, I wanted him to succeed. I felt his emotions as he raced against time to stop the looming disaster.<br /><br />A major problem I had with the book was the technical aspect and details which were beyond my comprehension. All the technical parts got very monotonous for me. Perhaps if I had more knowledge of programming and cyber-crimes, the book might have been a 5 star read for me. However, the author did manage to make up for the boring parts with some very surprising twists.<br /><br />Zero Day is a book that's very relevant today. We do need to be aware of how hugely dependent we have become on technology. Our lives are almost run by technology. Most of us will have a panic attack, if our internet suddenly stops working or if we are not able to check our emails. Zero Day forces one to ponder on how vulnerable we are to any kind of cyber-crime. Technology has definitely helped mankind, but like every great innovation, it does have its flaws. Thanks to technology, you can shop at home, book flight tickets sitting at home, talk to a person on the other side of the world, pay your bills online and even control your bank accounts. You hardly even need to step out of your homes. Do we realize how much of ourselves we give out on social networking sites? Almost our entire lives are so out there, so open to any kind of attack. Zero Day, apart from being action-packed, is also informative.

B0036EH3WK|4.0|Lost was without doubt one of the great tv series of the last 20 years. The great shame is that a series which promised so much was unable to deliver a satisfying climax which the viewers craved. Nevertheless, although some viewers have let their disappointment at the ending colour their judgement of the entire series, I feel a bit more magnanimous and recognise that for the majority of its 6 seasons it kept me entertained and emotionally invested the way few other programmes did.  There is much to admire about Lost but for me its three greatest assets were;  1) The construct of the show: The flash-forward's/flash backwards/flash sideways constructs allowed the writers the freedom to explore the back-story of the characters. Obviously flashbacks are a fairly common device used in tv programmes, but Lost fully integrated them into the fabric of the show, cleverly using them to show some previously unknown aspect of a particular character or undermine a previously held belief of the viewers - generally these flashback complemented the on-island action adding a level of depth and pathos to the events which were occurring. They also cleverly intertwined the characters lives prior to the crash.  2) The acting: Not much needs to be said, for a show which contained such a large ensemble cast there are very few bad performances. Particular mention to who really steals most scenes that he is in.  3) The story: - This is the most important aspect of any piece of fiction - for the first couple of seasons Lost seemed to have more than enough plot to sustain 5 different programmes. Perhaps in some ways this led to the unsatisfying conclusion as the writers were unable to tie up all the questions they had raised. Still, it was a wild ride while it lasted and I can remember the excitement of tuning in every week just to see what was going to happen next.    No review of Lost is complete it would seem without mentioning the ending. For some reason American series seem to have a particular problem with delivering satisfying endings. The Sopranos and BSG suffered the same fate. In fact, of the small number of truly great programmes, only The Wire produced a conclusion that felt absolutely right. On reflection, my over-riding feeling is one of sadness; the writers had proven their capabilities over so much of the series so it certainly wasn't lack of ability which caused the ending to fall flat. I think in the end they opted for a safe option which they felt would please the most people - the irony is that they actually pleased very few. I suspect that given the chance they would do things differently. The ending does undermine some of the replay value of Lost - but it can't rob the series (as some reviewers have asserted) of its merits.  I suspect that when that in 10 or 20 years time, history will be a lot kinder to Lost and it will be looked back on as one of the great tv series of all time. It wasn't perfect, but its failings were as much to do with its ambitions to tell an epic story being so great. I personally will remember the series with a fondness I feel for few other programmes.
B0002DB52M|4.0|Mr. von Trier doesn't always make films that appeal to me, but you can be sure he'll get a dynamite performance out of his lead actress, in this case, the magnificent Nicole Kidman. A (sort of) tribute to Thornton Wilder's Our Town, there is no discernable set, some props and some sound effects, but it's basically a tour de force for actors creating a world without the benefit of a real milieu. The actors, all of them, succeed brilliantly. We're not talking about theatre workshop actors; Kidman, Paul Bettany, Lauren Bacall, Jeremy Davies, Chlo&eacute; Sevigny, James Caan, and all involved are in tune with the narrative and the settings don't seem to matter. At 3 hours, it didn't take long to realize that I never noticed anything other than a good story, though it's not always pleasant. Von Trier became my champion after Breaking the Waves, with Emily Watson. After that, I saw Dancer in the Dark, with a brutal story about futility, with a perfect performance from Bjork; I can't watch that film again. After Dogville, I realized that von Trier is mean-spirited and it's good to be cautious. Dogville catches the basic evil in human nature, though it's more about survival than true evil. Any film freak should see Dogville, if only for the experimental novelty. Thanks to a bravura cast, it succeeds on that level. Don't expect laffs 'n stuff because they won't be there. There's also a twist ending that adds a bit to Kidman's extraordinarily complex character. No spoiler: There's something going on with Grace, but she's not talkin'...I heard von Trier has never been to America; if the voice-over didn't say it took place in the Rocky Mountains, I was sure it was more like Appalacia.

1582701709|1.0|I have a neighbor who keeps trying to tell me to think positively, and peddled this piece of nonsense in my direction.  Her whole agenda was to get me to be more optimistic and less negative.  She is, in fact, a psychologist of some sort with a specialty in behavior modification (or so I'm guessing).    \\"The Secret\\" is premised on the notion that your thoughts can effect the world, or your surroundings at the very least.  We all fantasize about that.  Everybody knows it's all hokum, but Joe average likes to fantasize that his prayers can somehow magically be manifested somewhere and someway.  You know it's not true, but praying keeps you going in low points.  It's why we have faith in a deity of some kind.  The idea that there's a corrective force out there with your same moral outlook, and that it'll correct the short comings or the world, or what you see as negative experiences.    This book plays up to that, but it plays up to the actual notion that the reader believes their thoughts control or manipulate actual events, and also plays up to the notion that since you're not into other people's favor, you therefore are placed at a disadvantage.  Again, this is another schizophrenic trait.    Me, I cracked a few pages, thought it merely new age BS, but upon reflection I now see it as another tool in the mental health crusade that the United States has been on in the last twenty plus years.  Big deal.    I'm guessing there are two categories of fans for this book; those who innocently believe in it, and those who invest mind, body and soul into this trash; i.e. actually BELIEVE it contents.  The first category are the sweet and lovable morons who are essentially harmless.  The second category are those with potential schizophrenic symptoms, and, in the eyes of the so-called experts, in need of treatment or hospitalization.    I guess there's a third category; those in on the joke.  They're either researchers or mental health advocates/experts of some kind trying to shape this nation's policy for a healthier and more \\"positive\\" existence, or they're mercenaries out to cash in on this work either by selling material relating to this work or, worse yet, actually using the techniques.    Me, I can't believe anyone in their right mind would ACTUALLY BELIEVE that they could influence the world with the power of thought.  But then again I have hard time with religion, and tons of people seem to believe in that.  Which leads one to wonder why religious types aren't given the same kind of treatment as fans of this book.    Just a thought.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|I have been a follower of Darren Aronofsky's films since Pi, and with each release, his stories have gotten more precise, more refined and more visceral. He's been getting the most out of his cast and has a handful of Oscar nominations and three wins in the category of acting that can be attributed (in part) to his visionary way of storytelling. Black Swan is responsible for one of these wins as Natalie Portman carried the movie on her wings.<br /><br />I saw the movie for the first time tonight, and my initial excitement of seeing the traits and characteristics of an Aronofsky film quickly turned to confusion before turning to disappointment. The elements that make up an Aronofsky masterpiece were there, but they lacked the cohesion to draw it all together. I stopped caring about Portman's character and quickly grew to dislike her. I am honestly baffled that this movie was nominated for best picture/best director, and equally stunned that Natalie took home the Oscar for best actress in a leading role. Her dancing was impressive considering she hadn't danced ballet before signing on, but I was truly uninspired by the character she played. She cries in virtually every scene, and when she's not crying (and even when she is STILL crying) she hallucinates. For no reason. To sum up: Crying in every scene. Hallucinating for no reason.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br />Some are going to try to convince you that it was the pressures of her job that drove her to go mad, but if that's the case, it's never explained. I was expecting to discover that she was schizophrenic or had a drug addiction or SOMETHING that would give credibility and legitimacy to the hallucinations -- you know, the way Darren did in Pi, or Requiem or The Fountain or even The Wrestler. I can assure you, I work in an EXTREMELY stressful environment on a daily basis, and at no time have I had visions of a lesbian encounter, followed by me stabbing someone to death followed by me sprouting wings followed by me discovering that instead of stabbing someone to death an hour earlier I had actually stabbed myself but never noticed until now, but since the show must go on, I think I'll dance a little more and then die.<br /><br />Great storyline, Darren. You putz.t instead of stabbing someone to death an hour earlier I had actually stabbed myself but never noticed until now, but since the show must go on, I think I'll dance a little more and then die.    Great storyline, Darren. You putz.
B001GCUO5W|3.0|This is a decent movie -- which puts it at the low end of the spectrum for a Scorsese film.  I thought DiCaprio's performance was also subpar for the movies he's done lately.      * SLIGHT PSEUDO-SPOILER ALERT *    Plot-wise, this is one of those movies that probably would have been revelatory if it had been made, I dunno, 30 years ago.  As it is, audiences have been trained to expect at least one twist in any kind of suspense plot, so what comes across to the characters as a surprising turn of events really isn't surprising at all to most viewers.  Case in point: if you're watching a movie about some sort of elaborate heist made at any point in recent memory, you basically know someone's going to get double-crossed.  It doesn't register to you as a twist until that double-cross is revealed as all part of somebody else's triple-cross, and there's maybe even a quadruple-cross going on.  This movie felt to me like it stopped at the double cross and then went, \\"Ta-da!\\"     Other reviewers have made good points about it not being all about the twist, but I ultimately disagree.  The movie itself seems preoccupied with the question of what's going on, and once you know definitively, there's not a lot left to care about.  Yeah, there's some psycho-drama here, and asking of big questions, but I've seen that done better in lots of other movies, including Inception with DiCaprio in the same year.  And that movie was a lot more fun to watch.  (Christopher Nolan also did Memento, another movie that did the cerebral parts of this movie way better.  I think Scorsese should stick to crime and stylistic violence; he does those better than anybody else.)    What really bothered me about this movie, though, is that DiCaprio just doesn't convince me at all in his part as a tough guy everyman.  His mannerisms and facial expressions look to me like someone doing an impression of a '50s tough guy rather than someone actually smoking or grimacing or whatever.  He constantly thrusts his lower jaw forward to look salt-of-the-earthier, and it does not work.  Really, his performance in this movie could be summed up as his role in Inception plus an impression of Marlon Brando in \\"On the Waterfront\\".
B004FQKY5Q|5.0|This is an amazing album!!!!! My first reaction to it was happy tears - they are back, they are as great as ever,this is everything I expected from their comeback and even more! I loved each and every song on Charm School. It's a must have for every Roxette fan out there. And as far as I am concerned, this is just the beginning, there will be more albums and the tour is already massive to confirm how successful and popular they are and always gonna be!

I think this book is a great gift fro any one who enjoys reading like I do.
B000RH0C8G|4.0|I figured since the new braintrust of the New York Mets figures so prominently in the entire 'Moneyball' philosophy, it makes sense for me as a fan to read this book. I'm glad I did because, as a life-long baseball fan, it changed my perspective of the game. It also helped me understand why Billy Beane was a bust for the Mets, considering I was a kid when Billy Beane was drafted and I remember all the hoopla about him back then.<br /><br />If you are a Met fan and you can't make sense out of the moves Sandy Alderson has made this offseason, you need to read this book! Also, it gave some insight into Paul DePodesta, who was Billy Beane's right-hand man in Oakland and is now one of Alderson's deputies with the Mets.<br /><br />Also, as a politics buff, I found it funny how the panel assembled by Comissioner Bud Selig included George Will and Paul Volcker, where the conservative Will lobbied for the maintenance of socialism in baseball while Volcker, an Obama advisor, was the one skeptical if small market teams were really suffering under the current structure.
B003Y5H53S|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />1. The above is one synopsis of \\"Rango\\"'s plot.<br /><br />2. Speaking of which, will Culture Club's \\"Karma Chameleon\\" make it onto the soundtrack?<br /><br />3. Some moviegoers will have a blast spotting the cornucopia of movie references \\"Rango\\" throws at us, particularly \\"Blazing Saddles\\". The Star Wars Tatooine saloon scenes, \\"The Road Warrior\\", \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\", and even \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" also come to mind. However,there is another movie from which \\"Rango\\" borrows its premise which I bet nobody ever considered: \\"Flushed Away\\" (except the danger there is too much water, not the lack of same). Check it out on IMDb, and you'll see why.<br /><br />4. If you have young children, instead of \\"Rango\\", where they'll probably fidget, yawn, and whine, take them home and pop SpongeBob Squarepants's \\"Pest of the West\\" episode into the DVD player instead. Same boisterous \\"Rango\\" premise, but much more attention-grabbing.<br /><br />5. In that vein the PG-rating is too lenient. I would elevate it to PG-13 for mature themes, killings, scatological humor, and risqu&eacute; references. Smart, sophisticated, irreverent moviegoers who appreciate intelligent, polysyllabic, sizzling word play will probably get the most out of \\"Rango\\". Stoned people, too, though of course I don't advocate this. It will probably be extremely popular at college campus film festivals in the near future.<br /><br />6. Most of the time, Sheriff Rango (Johnny Depp) seems to channeling the late Don Knotts's Barney Fife, or Knotts's character in \\"The Shakiest Gun in the West\\".<br /><br />7. Yep, the cinematography is even more realistic-looking than that of \\"Wall-E\\".<br /><br />8. With its menagerie of mangy, unsightly desert critters, \\"Rango\\" seemed to be shooting for a gross-out \\"Ren and Stimpy\\" or \\"The Misadventures of Flapjack\\" vibe.<br /><br />9. I went to see \\"Rango\\" with my mom. She liked \\"Rango's\\" theme of ultimately accepting responsibility. \\"But, Mom\\", I said, \\"you were asleep for half the movie!\\" \\"That's okay, I was awake for the climax (the showdown with Rattlesnake Jake), the important part.\\"<br /><br />10. By the way, Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) was my favorite character in the movie. Imposing, malevolent, intimidating, he was like a venomous anaconda. Ironically, he humiliatingly and mercilessly exposes Rango's phony lawman stunt and forces him into temporary, suicidal exile, where he has an epiphany.<br /><br />11. As for the gigantic eye in the tunnel, it was either a heat-induced hallucination or a reference to the 1998 version of \\"Godzilla\\".<br /><br />12. Now, did I enjoy the movie? Generally, I did because it was ambitious, whip-smart, engrossing to look at, and lively. However, it was also derivative, meandering, a bit self-conscious in its humor, and sometimes difficult to hear. Still, it was worth the $6.25 I paid.<br /><br />P.S.: I think Rango should team up with the gecko in those Geico commercials.s okay, I was awake for the climax (the showdown with Rattlesnake Jake), the important part.\\"     10.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|Ok right off the back, disregard everyone complaining about the music because you absolutely WON'T notice it unless you've gone back and watched every originally aired episode and watched the DVD side by side just to compare.     This is an amazing show and I've been watching the DVD's for about a month now. I just got to the final disc today and I'm almost sad that there aren't more than 65 episodes.     The discs come packed with many episodes and the menu is SO simple: Play All or Select Episode - such simplicity is great, especially for me because I like getting right to the point. Pop the DVD in and start watching! No boring warnings and advertisements, just start the show.    BUY THIS DVD! This is one of the most amazing animated shows ever, and it really opens my eyes to how much TV has gone downhill. Quite sad really, but it's a walk down memory lane for people like me who were around to know about such great shows as this one and others from the 90's.
1439153663|5.0|Every now and then I read a book to find out it is written by a first time author and it just takes my breath away.  This is an amazing book and kept me up a couple of nights unable to sleep because I needed to keep reading.  I was so deeply drawn into the storyline.  These characters feel like flesh and blood people.  They will make you laugh at times, which is a challenge in itself given the book was written during the slavery period.  Mostly I found my heart racing as this family clung together to protect each other as much as humanly possible throughout all their suffering...and then I cried.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. It essentially disproves the romantic notion that a person's hard work and perseverance overcame any and all obstacles and their achievements are entirely of their own accord with no luck and no help from anyone else. Malcolm Gladwell gracefully weaves through a wide variety of topics ranging from Canadian Junior Hockey to Bill Gates to New York City's late 19th century garment industry to show how outliers thrived in their time and place.<br /><br />It reminded me of a comment Warren Buffett made at a lecture I saw him give in the Spring of 2000. He talked about how his wealth came from being lucky enough to be born at a time and place when his skills and abilities were valued. He said that had he been born 10,000 years earlier, he would not have survived because his skill set is not conducive for the life of a nomadic hunter-gatherer.<br /><br />The key point to take away from this book is \\"Outliers are those who have been given opportunities-and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them\\". This is something I have known about my own life; that certain lucky breaks and fortuitous random encounters with new people has led to many of my own personal and professional accomplishments.
B004GGQMTW|4.0|I would consider that after all this years, Thelma and Louise has become a classic, it's amazing how Ridley Scott being British captures the feeling of this two American women, the cast is good Brad Pitt's first roll I believe, and Michael Madsen is great, but the greatest performance is delivered by Geena Davies, which makes you think whatever happened to this great actress. Thelma and Louise is a road movie, with many surprises that arise along the road.<br />I definitely recommend this movie!!!
030726999X|4.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in the trilogy as they built suspense for the last book but I think \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\\" failed in some ways to measure up to the other two books.
B004HGBUVG|5.0|I knew within seconds of hearing the opening to; \\"Buttercup\\", that this is a MUST HAVE. The song title had me expecting something entirely different. \\"Buttercup\\" is traditional Lucinda; raw, gritty, dirty and full of the 'in your face attitude' that defines Williams when she is in such a mood. \\"Blessed\\" is her \\"Salt of the Earth\\" on a more mellow note, but not lacking truth. The truth Lucinda writes and sings of is so damn apropo today. So it is too for any time past or future.<br /><br />I have yet to find a 'toss away' on this set. Each song wraps around you and hauls your ass into every emotion Williams honors us by sharing. You have no choice, you WILL be captive and happily so. The band is extremely TIGHT without being over produced. The guitar work, rips, tears and puts you on notice that you can expect riffs that will be anything but expected. Low dirty guitar work that throughout the record, will make you wish you had taken Mellencamp's advice. It is undoubtedly the most solid, cohesive, hard and soft string work to be found on ANY record of late.<br /><br />Lyrically; \\"Blessed\\" (entire album) is some of the strongest and most poignant words ever written by Lucinda or anyone else. These are lyrics that songwriters ache for and when hearing them, become filled with envy. No mistake though, these words ARE Lucinda Williams. A portrait of her painted by life, set to music that defies a proper critique and that evades all proper description. Words that describe that which most of us MIGHT find something, however small, in our own lives to compare. Such comparisons will only dissolve away as we continue to listen and reality makes us see that these words describe Lucinda Williams. Words wrapped in the color of music that most assuredly too is Lucinda Williams.<br /><br />Yeah, that's Lucinda. Welcome back. It has been a far too empty world without you.<br /><br />Respect,<br />Gunner<br /><br />(If you go to Lucinda's web site and provide a receipt of proof of purchase - you will receive 4 unreleased tracks.

B002ZG99TK|1.0|...and enjoy this popcorn-flick?? Rather blow out your brains! Poor script, action-sequenses so overdone it makes the Lethal weapon-movies seem deep and realistic. The characters are so unsympathetic you don't care about who gets run down or not. The beginning was promising yes, but not longer than when the train takes a stroll on its own, if I'd been a railroad-worker I'd really be offended by this movie. These guys here appeares as idiots one by one. The \\"best\\" part is when Denzel becomes Indiana Jones and jumps his way across the runaway-units before one of the worst endings I've ever experienced at the cinema.     Based on a true story?? \\"Runaway train\\" - watch that instead. Not a true story, but far more believable!
0316098337|4.0|Emma Donoghue has crafted a world of infinite possibility within the constrictive environment of an 11x11 room.  Told from the perspective of a 5 year old boy who has never ventured outside his room, this story offers a unique look at the ways in which we learn, and often create knowledge from the world around us - even one as small as Jack's Room.  As educators, we must realize that each student is going to bring a similar limited perspective into the classroom.  Addressing individual beliefs and abilities is a requirement for any responsible teacher.  And if we are to teach them how to read, write and interpret the world, it is imperative that we stress the importance of context, of bringing that content into the real world.      The text's unique setting and distinct narrative voice also provides an opportunity for a lesson in creative writing.  By showing students how imaginative and powerful a writer's voice can be (even if it does become somewhat cumbersome at times), we can encourage them to seek out their own authorial voices and explore the world within their own Room.

B001EC3JME|1.0|This looked good and I wanted it for my Red Line flashlight.  Less than a week of use and the stitching came apart.  The light had only been in and out maybe 10 times.  I emailed Nite Ize and got back a form letter from Kacy Lee Duncan of Nite Ize that completely ignored the issue I brought up.  It was clear that the email I sent was never actually read.  I mailed back asking for them to review what I had said about the holster coming apart and have not heard back.  Nite Ize products are VERY hit and miss.  These things seem like patented items made under license by Nite Ize because some are great and others are amazingly bad.  You need only check the reviews on Amazon to see what that's like.  I am VERY disappointed in Nite Ize since I thought they were an American company that would actually stand behind their products; clearly, they do not.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />Almost 2 months after the initial contact (and two more e-mails) and NOTHING.  The lesson as usual is buyer beware.  Nite-Ize WILL NOT stand behind their products.  I thought this would have been a fairly straight-forward warranty issue.  Stitching can come apart; that's life...then not only ignoring your customers, but trying to placate them with form letters while they have real issues is very sad.  The products are hit and miss but Nite-Ize customer service is non-existant.
B00127RAJY|5.0|1.  My favorite part of this DVD is that it combines cardio and strength very effectively. I found myself really appreciating the way she puts the two together and explains, for instance, that you can't do just bicep curls by themselves. You need to combine them with lower body strength for maximum calorie burn; she also points out that you should never be static so your heart rate stays up even during the strength portion of the circuits. It's tips like this that I value.    2. I liked Jillian on Biggest Loser but felt that she went a little overboard sponsoring and promoting everything under the sun. I was hesitant to buy her products, thinking she was a sell-out, but she is very likeable in this DVD. Surprised to find she has a good personality and is so smart about what she does. Also, she does not yell or get too intense (something you might expect from watching Biggest Loser).    3. I consider myself a reasonably fit person. Got this DVD because I am not that great at cardio, though. I found that while Level 1 (20 mins) definitely got my heart rate up and got me sweaty, I needed to do Level 2 as well to feel like I got a full workout. So I do both for a 40 minute workout total. There are two assistants, one who does a beginner variation and one who does the movements in the advanced  way. I almost always do the advanced version. Again, I wouldn't call this DVD easy, but for those with some experience in strength training already who want a challenge, completing 2 levels at once will do the trick.    4. You need a set of hand weights to do these workouts, and if you'll be on a hard surface, a mat. I have done the workouts without the hand weights and they are still pretty effective. I do the motions anyway, flexing the muscles and trying to create a natural resistance. This is a good way to get by if you don't want to purchase hand weights...you just won't get quite as much of a workout in your shoulders, biceps, and back. (However, her push-ups and push-up variations target some of these areas for sure! Phew!)    5. Overall very effective, well-organized, encouraging, and modern setting (it annoys me when the backdrop and music are outdated). Jillian does give a fair amount of tips on how to avoid knee injury by doing the movements properly, but if you already have knee issues and do not like jumping jacks or jump rope type exercises, do not purchase. There is no variation for the jumping cardio in this video.

Very watchable, well written and paced, with clever plot twists.  Though I usually don't like mystery type series, this one's exceptional because you can't guess \\"who done it\\" and it's not predictable.  Kudos to the brilliant writing team who creates the stories and crafts the dialogue -- it's some of the best tv in recent years.<br /><br />I originally got the first season because I liked Nathan Fillion's acting in Joss Whedon's legendary \\"Firefly\\" series (a must have). Liked the homage to it with the space cowboys reference during halloween party episode (hey is firefly ever coming back? we can hope).  Nathan's immensely likeable, very watchable, and the way the chemistry between him and the lady detective plays out is a perfect balance between suspense and wit.<br /><br />Superb series, thanks to everyone involved for doing it right; one of the top series in recent years.  A++ highly recommended.<br /><br />-ken

1595141715|2.0|Someone suggested this book to me.  Since I have grown children, maybe I am not in a mind set to understand the dynamics of some of today's teens and the peer pressure they go through.  Perhaps in my day, when we got bullied it was far worse then I feel Hannah went through. We dusted ourselves off and started all over again.  I understand that some of the things that happened, could have been prevented but her guilt about the events was not enough for me to understand her ending her life.  She sounded that there were many underlying problems with her that may have led her to ending her life.  When I was a kid we were made fun of, left out of clicks, had reputations etc. we either kicked the crap out of each other or called it a day.  I believe Hannah was a coward and weak at best and her biggest guilt of all was leaving her words to haunt all she told on tape.  Now that is selfish.  I found this book disappointing.
B00383ZTXO|5.0|As we know this is a great album but the remixing sounds horrible, i'm just wondering did it always sound this muffled? The bonus disc is cool, it's great to hear iggy berate the audience not to mention its a pretty decent soundboard recording, i think theres a bit of distortion near the end. The live disc also has great longer versions of raw power tracks before they were presumably told to edit them in the studio.     5 stars for the album's music 2 stars for the remix and for the second disc 5 stars great live show and two bonus tracks.

The case has a slight edging around the face which I like because that keeps it from laying on the screen if I set it down that way. The edge is not high enough to get in the way of texting or reaching any of the buttons. The ports are all easily accessed while the phone is in the case. I like this case because the back is textured just enough to not slip out of my hands, but not so much it sticks going in and out of my pocket. A nice case. The red color is even and deep. The case isn't made to take hard drops, like an otterbox, but is is good at keeping the phone scratch free and easily gripped.
B0036S4C6G|1.0|Although I found the book to be well written, it never fully drew me in. The characters were under developed, as well as the story jumping back and forth from different points in time was annoying. The story line was difficult to follow, as the reader lost track of who was narrating half the time. The author fails to use quote marks for dialog which is off putting.    Also, and probably most importantly, if you are not particularly interested in \\"punk\\" or the era of \\"punk\\" you may find the story tedious and uber-boring. I respect the author, but this book just fell short for me to the point I could not even finish it.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|Unimaginable what big coprorations, people on wall street and politicians will do in the name of greed.   No one cares about the little people, middle class and hard workers.  All about greed.  Why now they are making profits are these corporations not being made to repay the bailout.  They are still receiving huge bonuses. Why?   Its the rich and the poor.  Its a me world.  What has happend to our morals.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My son will only take the soothie pacifiers so when I found this I had to try it out.  He LOVES it and wants it constantly so I'm going to have to buy him another one!  It's nice also as he has been learning how to put the pacifier in himself and hold it in by holding onto the monkey.  It makes mom and dad's life easier too!  The only issue is that it is attached so cleaning is a little tricky.  You have to cover the stuffed animal while you wash the pacifier.  He spit-up on the monkey so now I need to wash it, too... and I'm thinking I'll just throw it in the washing machine in a garment bag?  We'll see how that works....
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|This film could not arrive on the shelves at a more appropriate time: natural disasters such as hurricanes/tornadoes/earthquakes/tsunamis/winter blizzards cover that part of the news that is not flooded with stories of man's inhumanity to man, lending a yearning for discovering some meaning to all of this.  If that meaning comes at the point of death then that is at least something to comfort us.  HEREAFTER is a thinking man's film from Clint Eastwood, a film that carries his trademark concern for human communication to a new level,  And it works.<br /><br />George Lonegan (Matt Damon) had an experience as a child with encephalomyelitis that left him with the ability to communicate with the dead -a psychic.  After some years of using this as a profession (with the aid of his brother Billy - Jay Mohr) he has given up this disturbing 'curse' and become a construction worker. Billy pleads with him to continue as a psychic but George is too disturbed by his talent and seeks peace.  Simultaneously we are introduced to a French TV journalist Marie Lelay (C&eacute;cile De France) and her boyfriend Didier (Thierry Neuvic) as the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami destroys their vacation and Marie is drowned for a while - but revives: the experience  changes her outlook and she takes a break form her Parisian YTV job to write  a book about her hereafter experience. And simultaneously the brothers Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) try to keep their drug addicted mother whole and Jason is accidentally killed: Marcus is devastated by the loss of his brother and by the fact that he is to be placed in a foster home. These three people's lives intersect in a course of events that lands them each in London and their shared belief in the hereafter is what manages to bring them a semblance of sanity, despite the world's negative opinion of their beliefs.<br /><br />Peter Morgan  ('The Queen', 'Longford', 'Frost/Nixon', 'The Other Boleyn Girl', etc) wrote this absorbing tale and Clint Eastwood directs with a true flair for the subject matter.  The special effects are extraordinarily well done, especially the underwater sequences.  Damon and the beautiful and talented C&eacute;cile De France are excellent in their roles as are the boys who play the brothers  and the cameos by such luminaries as Derek Jacoby, Marthe Keller, Steve Schirripa, and Bryce Dallas Howard.  Though the music score is attributed to Clint Eastwood, for the most part the music is provided by excerpts form Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto!  The film goes on a bit long (over 2 hours) but the twists and turns of the action keep it well worth watching.  Grady Harp, March 11ith a true flair for the subject matter.

B003L20IFQ|5.0|I was not expecting much--except to be bored.  It was so compelling that I'm still reeling.  It takes a lot of guts for a director to do this kind of movie, and a skilled one to pull it off.  He pulled this one off, and it was one of the most rewarding that I've seen in a long time.
B000QCQ9O8|2.0|The first 20% of the book (Kindle reader) was enjoyable:  then the author decided that sex needed to be the focus of the story.  It ruined it.  Too bad.  The story line was interesting.  I liked the characters, but after sex became the story line it was ruined - sent it to kindle's storage room.

As many of the reviewers have said--not his best work, nor his scariest, but certainly one of the more thoughtful novels that he's done.

0670022411|2.0|I really wanted to like this one....but....    After hearing an interview on NPR with the author, I was so so anxious to read this book that I went immediately to purchase it.  What a disappointment!  The book started slow, as I was cautioned by other reviewers, so I stuck with it.  It didn't get any more interesting.  I was greatly disappointed that an author of Harkness educational background would rely on so many tired, overused and excessively quixotic story lines in an attempt to engage the reader.  Throwing in historical background is a nice touch but hardly makes up for the uninspired story archetypes.  A deeply disappointing reading experience.

If you want something that is entertaining enough then watch it...if you want a good Zombie film from an accredited Zombie Film director and producer then look elsewhere...i rented it to watch and see if i wanted to add it to my Romero collection...i will not be purchasing it

0756404738|3.0|This book is deserving of almost any superlative you can imagine. And only a single middling criticism.<br /><br />First for the good stuff - breathtakingly well written book that you simply CANNOT put down. The characters are the same funny, complex and enchanting bunch from the first book. Its full of action and adventure and mystery. The pace of the narration is measured to perfection to deliver the utmost enjoyable reading experience and is successful. Its a huge book and I read it faster than most 200 page modern \\"novels\\". It seemed that I was reading the final lines barely moments after picking it up (yep, read it mostly in one sitting :)) At that moment I couldn't have been happier with the book I had just read and I certainly could not have been more disappointed that it ended.<br /><br />And as I lay in almost post-coital bliss I was horrified to discover that not only was I not slowly drifting to a happy and content sleep, but was in fact experiencing increasing and increasing discontent. Discontent and disappointment because the book ended. And nothing happened. Read this again - NOTHING HAPPENED.<br /><br />The single criticism of an otherwise magnificent book - it ended exactly in the same place where it began. The book takes close to 1000 pages to accomplish exactly NOTHING. Yeah, its full of adventure and all that... but nothing happens. The two timelines the narration is based around DO NOT progress one single nanometer. Tell me if the following describes the beginning or the end of the book - Old Kvothe is telling his story as he battles dust bunnies and bakes pie. Something horrible has happened or is happening or is about to happen. Well, there is something horrible in the air, that is certain. Young Kvothe is strutting around the University being snotty to his teachers (GASP!) almost having mastered the Name of the Wind (DOUBLE GASP!!!), pining after the mysterious but untouchable Dena (GASP GASP GASP!!) and something horrible is stinking up the air with its completely invisible and intangible presence (CCCCOMBO GASP!!!!). Start? Finish? Something insultingly pointless? Decide for yourselves.<br /><br />I am disappointed with this book. Not because its a bad book, but because its an trully good book that ends up being utterly pointless. A book, especially a fiction novel such as this, is at its core a story. The value of the book is the value of the story it tells. Yeah, you have the bells and whistles of the actual telling, but it all boils down to the core story. This book tells no story. It has no intrinsic story. It is empty. You can skip this book entirely and move to book three of the series and it would make for an almost seamless transition. And that is just not good enough.<br /><br />Going back to the review title - reading this book is a bit like molesting yourself.

B004H4XI5O|5.0|Upon buying this book, I was under the impression the book would be a somewhat trivial inverstigation of how memory operates and some ways in which one specific writer would try to apply those understandings of memory to the real world. The reality of the book couldn't be further from the truth. The book uses this narrative story of Foer's remarkable journey into the depths in a world of memory training and mneumonic techniques as a foundation from which Foer creates a palace of background investigation into the workings of human memory and its context in human culture. From the book's opening allusion to the Ancient Greek story of Simonides and the creation of \\"the art of memory\\" I became enamored with Foer's thesis: The human mind holds more potential than most would consider possible.
B00338QENI|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is the best non-fiction book that I have read in years. It is fascinating, eye-opening, and at times horrifying. It is the story of a woman, her family, her cells, and science. It is rare to find a book that deeply touches both the mind and the heart at the same time. And this book does exactly that.<br /><br />In 1951, a black woman by the name of Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Along with treating Henrietta, her doctor also took a sample of her cervical cells for research purposes without her knowledge. Surprisingly, the doctors were able to successfully grow Henrietta's cells in vitro; cells collected from other patients always died outside of the body. Henrietta's cells grew to become an immortal cell line named HeLa. They have helped the progression of medical research in incredible and unimaginable ways. HeLa cells have helped in the development of the polio vaccine, AIDS research, cancer research, research on the effects of radiation, and gene mapping, among many other research projects. Not only have Henrietta's cells made serious contributions to medical research, but they have also made the people who grow and sell her cells a lot of money. And yet Henrietta's family remains unable to afford health insurance.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot deftly alternates between the story of Henrietta's family and the story of the HeLa cells in science. She brings Henrietta to life. She shows you where she grew up. She makes you sympathetic towards Henrietta's family. And through it all, she writes in a way that makes the daunting science accessible to the layperson.<br /><br />This book brings a number of medical ethical issues to light and makes you think about them with a new perspective. In some cases, our society has progressed since Henrietta's time. Protecting patients' privacy and using informed consent have become legally actionable, standard practices. However, even to this day, doctors are able to take your \\"discarded\\" cells for research purposes without your permission just as they did with Henrietta. Is that ethically right? Should people have property rights over those cells? I don't know the answers, but the questions are worth thinking about.<br /><br />This book has my highest recommendations.your \\"discarded\\" cells for research purposes without your permission just as they did with Henrietta.

B004ETVAH0|4.0|Without Les Paul contemporary music would be a very different listening experience.Paul created some of the greatest signature guitars and was a terrific player. Paul also created great music with his partner Mary Ford and Beck's intent here is to recreate some of these classics from a different generation with the help of others in tribue to Paul. Fans should not expect typical Beck however as the purpose here isn't to celebrate Jeff Beck but to recreate the music of the 50's with as much gusto and fidelity as possible. The album opens with a Rockabilly one-two punch of \\"Double Talkin' Baby\\" and \\"Crusin'\\" before settling in with Swing and some of the Jazz standards that Paul was fond of. Gary \\"U.S.\\" Bonds makes an appearence on some of these oldies as well.<br /><br />Featuring guests such as Brian Setzer and Imelda May (who recreates Ford's lush overdubbed vocals on recordings with pre-recorded backing vocals), Beck dives in whole heartedly on this release sounding energized in playing his friend's music.<br /><br />I'd suggest listening to samples to see if this is for you. I heard this stuff as a kid because my brother-in-law and sister loved Les Paul and Mary Ford and used to play this stuff endlessly. At the time I had no appreciation for it but as I've gotten older I appreciate the craft and art in creating those classic tracks and Paul's playing which influenced an entire generation of guitar players.<br /><br />I'd also suggest renting or buying the DVD or Blu-ray as it has the whole concert plus footage of Beck and Paul playing together in 1983 where they playfully try to pull each other's amp cords out after blistering solos (all in good fun I might add). It's clear from this album that Beck was very fond of Paul (who continued to play at the club where this was recorded every Monday up until his death)and that fondness and love of Paul comes through loud and clear on this recording.<br /><br />The best price online (at present)is here however Best Buy has a Limited Edition 2 disc set that also includes the burn-on-demand/digital download (although it's pressed on a regular CD in this case for Best Buy)appearance at the Grammy Hall of Fame for Beck offered here and at Rhino (as a digital download)that might be worth your while picking it.that also includes the burn-on-demand/digital download (although it's pressed on a regular CD in this case for Best Buy)appearance at the Grammy Hall of Fame for Beck offered here and at Rhino (as a digital download)that might be worth your while picking it.

0060751967|2.0|Roman Draganesti, leader of a powerful vampire coven in New York City, finds himself in need of emergency dental care.  At an all night clinic he finds Dr. Shanna Whelan, a young dentist living incognito in a witness protection program.  Roman arrives at the clinic just in time to rescue Shanna from her would-be killers, offers her his protection, then promptly falls in love with her.<br /><br />This didn't work for me, partly because I prefer my heroines with more brains and my vampires with more `bite', but mainly because the author's writing style did not appeal to me.  The writing is so simplistic, the characters so painfully one dimensional and without a shred of nuance that I felt like the story was geared for an adolescent audience.  (There are a couple of fairly explicit sex scenes, so this is definitely not intended as a young adult novel).<br /><br />As for the characters themselves...Roman is the typical tall, dark and handsome vampire leading man, albeit one that inhabits a watered-down vampire world.  These vampires have hearts that beat, they drink synthetic blood, they use the bathroom and they have to watch their weight.  If immortality ever held any appeal, the thought of spending eternity worrying about cellulite and muffin top pretty much squelched it!<br /><br />Shanna is annoyingly juvenile and almost painfully dim.  It's easier to believe that there are vampires living among us than to buy into the fact that this is supposed to be an adult woman who has graduated from med school. I was so bored by her endless internal turmoil - \\"I love Roman.  But Wait! He's evil.  No, he's good.  Evil!  Good!\\".<br /><br />Any obstacles to their happily-ever-after are easily overcome.  Vampires are dead to the world during the day?  No problem, Roman will develop a potion that allows him to stay awake in daylight.  Can't father children?  Roman figures a way around that one too.  I'm sure if Shanna wants a Caribbean honeymoon he'll whip up something that allows him to lay on the beach all day.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of something positive here, but I'm pretty much drawing a blank.  The Highlander vampires were kind of interesting, but then I've always been partial to men in kilts.  There is some humor but it's the in-your-face variety, nothing subtle or witty.<br /><br />Oh, and if something smells a little \\"off\\" to you, that would be the sequel bait planted conspicuously throughout this story.  That's right, if you enjoyed this then you'll be happy to know that this is just the first in a series.  Think I'll pass.<br /><br />No strong language (unless you count \\"God's Blood\\", which is used no less than 50 times).  Two fairly descriptive sex scenes.day.

Little Marie (Hughes), the teen who insulted Rocky when he suggested she clean up her act, is this final picture's leading lady. Sly's kid brother Frank, who had singing cameos in the first three movies, appears briefly in a restaurant scene.<br /><br />Archive footage vividly depicts several ghosts from Rocky's past: his beloved wife Adrian, manager and best friend Mickey Goldmill, and ring opponents Ivan Drago and Clubber Lang. Conspicuously missing is Apollo Creed, although Rock reminisces about their epic first bout.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />In this emotionally moving last chapter, Adrian's dead, Rocky lives only for the past. At 55, he has bouts of melancholy over her loss. Paulie (Young), Spider Rico (Lovell) and trainer Tony (Burton) are all that remain of the old days. Even the ice rink where Adrian and Rocky had their first date is rubble.<br /><br />A computer simulation of Rocky fighting current champ Mason 'the Line' Dixon (light heavyweight champ Tarver) revives interest in the old slugger.

0060936223|3.0|I was waiting eagerly for this book to come out in paper. I had been reading reviews and excerpts for a year and have always been interested in Patti Smith, mainly as a fashion, lifestyle paragon.  Even though I have seen her in concert, her music has never caught on with me.  It is touching to read about her and Mapplethorpe as young hipsters helping each other make the scene so skillfully in the big city and i respect their talent for that.  But, really being touched and moved by the music of a musician is missing, and Mapplethorpe photos may be technically awesome but the subject matter has never interested me much so I feel a little empty and superficial after devouring the book so avidly.
B002ZG9774|5.0|This is a must-see movie, really. The music makes you wanna dance, it makes you wanna be up there, onstage with the actors. It´s always great to see Cher, and it was about time she made another movie. What a comeback after all this time !!! What can I say about Christina? She´s gorgeous. A more than fair start for a newcomer in front of a camera. Honestly, the movie deserved more prizes. It should have been nominated for several academy awards. Anyway, I´d like to keep writing, but you´d better find out for yourselves if you haven´t seen the movie yet. Don´t waste any more of your time reading my review. Hurry, go see the movie, what are you waiting for?  By the way, this might be very, very interesting to overseas customers like me: The blu-ray edition WILL play anywhere. I didn´t know till I got it. I must confess that I took the risk and purchased it anyway. Luckily, it turned out right, thank God. It is region A, B, C, not region 1 ( or A), as the Amazon details read. I hope they don´t take this comment the wrong way, but they should provide the right information so we know what we can or cannot purchase for sure without taking any misleading steps.   Well, thanks for your time.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I was a bit skeptic at first when I heard about the idea that the next Star Trek movie is playing at a time before the original series starts and worse, with Captain Kirk still being at the academy. Although I consider myself a Star Trek fan, having all episodes of the original series and Next Generation as well as all Star Trek motion pictures; I did not like the \\"Enterprise\\" TV show spin-off, which also played at a time before the original series.<br /><br />I decided to give this movie a chance anyway (especially when I found out that even Leonard Nimoy (Mr.Spook) had a part in it, even though he swore years ago never to put on those \\"pointed\\" Vulcan ears ever again). Well, I was positively surprises about it and understand why Mr. Nimoy made an exception for this title after passing up the requests to take part in several of the previous Star Trek installments. Here is actually an example where the Prequel does NOT suck. The movie is also well done that non Star Trek fans can enjoy it without having a disadvantage of not being as familiar with the Star Trek universe as most fans. Star Trek knowledge is no prerequisite to ensure being well entertained.<br /><br />They also did a great job with this Bluray release, because they packed it to the roof with tons of great bonus features, including extensive documentaries and interviews about the process of creating this movie from start to finish.
075695195X|2.0|This book is excellent in many ways. The alternate reality of London ruled by wizards is well drawn, the plot moves right along, so that if you start the book you will want to finish it. There is a hollowness at the core of it however, in the character of the protagonist, Nathaniel. Both taken from and given away by his parents at the tender age of 5, and given to the care of a self absorbed nincompoop of a mediocre magician, it's certainly realistic that the boy would be emotionally damaged. Unfortunately, it makes for a very unsympathetic main character. His  Djinni slave, Bartimaeus, is funny and compelling. When the balance of power between them shifts, the possibility of a real relationship peeks into the equation. Unfortunately, the author chose not to pick up that possibility. Nathaniel is self absorbed, arrogant, vengeful, and incapable of seeing the slave/master relationship from any perspective but that of the righteous master. The author chooses not to delve into that moral quandary either. Nathaniel does have some moments of nobility, but it doesn't seem to come from a deep place within him. Nathaniel does not come across as a fundamentally noble person whose nobility and goodness was temporarily obscured by his dysfunctional upbringing in a corrupt world. Rather, he comes across as a petty, self absorbed, power hungry potential tyrant who understands nobility intellectually and therefore acts on it in small ways. Guilt over the fact that his petty revenge resulted in the murder of the woman who was like a mother to him leads him to want to get revenge, but there was no transformation of character there. This was so painfully disappointing because I really wanted to like the book! Reading about the sequel it appears that, as an adult, he is only a more powerful and successful version of the small minded person he was as a child. There are lots of great fantasy books out there. Read this one if you don't look for greatness, nobility, compassion or character transformation in your protagonist.
075666733X|5.0|This is an excellent book.  My sister had checked it out of the library and I thought to myself \\"whoa, I really want that book in my medical library\\".  I ordered two of them and am soooo glad.  One is a gift for my daughter and I know she will love it, too.
B002ZG9774|5.0|If you are a Cher Fan or Christina fan you will LOVE this movie! You will also love this if you love musicals or camp over the top productions. Cher has two fantastic songs in the film and Christina has eight. If you loved the soundtrack....BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The \\"Alien Anthology\\" has been long-awaited in high definition goodness pretty much since the technology hit the market.  This is one of the sets everyone wanted and was eager to see how the technology would make these films look and sound, with only \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" perhaps being more anticipated.  There was much pre-release speculation that this might be a letdown, especially after James Cameron (who was deeply involved with the restoration of \\"Alien\\" made some comments about \\"de-graining\\" it which had purists reeling with concern that it was a victim of the dreaded digital noise reduction , leaving it with a waxy, smeared look (much like the recent release of \\"Predator).  I am happy to report this set not only meets all expectations, but exceeds them.  Each film looks brilliant in 1080p high definition.  The films have been restired frame by frame with the original directors supervising and even technical problems that plagued the prior releases have been corrected.  I could go film by film but it would be an exercise in redundance as they all look fabulous, grain structures have been kept in tact.  \\"Aliens\\" did have some DNR applied, but for good reason given how bad it looked before.  The cameras that were used at the time were supposed to be state of the art, however, they were recalled the year after this was hot.  The film grain remains in tact, but the scratchy noise which washed out the color scheeme is gone.  These films have never looked better since they were each in the editing bays.  The soundtracks for each is a bombastic DTS-HD MA 5.1, and it's everything you would hope for.  \\"Alien\\" in particular ( made in 1978, released in '79) looks and sounds like it was shot yesterday.  Your house will shake every time a ship passes the screen.  Directional effects on all the films are awesome.  I heard sound effects I have never heard before thanks to the lossless encode.  \\"Aliens\\", the most action heavy, will blow you out of your seat and pulverize the listening area.  Alien 3 looks spectacular with David Fincher perfecting the visual look that would follow his films up to the recent \\"The Social Network.\\"  \\"Alien Resurrection\\" probably fares the best of the bunch, as it was the most recently made, and the colors just pop off the screen and the gunshots and explosions are deafening.      The special features are the most comprehensive, exhaustive set I have ever seen on any DVD release.  There are too many to list here, but there are dozens of featurettes, documentaries, all films have audio commentaries, isolated scores, etc.  Each film comes with an extended edition.  This is a first-rate DVD set and it is everything we fans could have hoped for.  This is the best these films will ver look and sound and with all the special features this makes this set a no-brainer.  Even if some may find the price a bit steep, you are getting 4 films, each with the director's cut and theatrical editions mastered at the highest level of quality.  Think of it as an investment and something you will enjoy over and over.  The special features alone will take viewers a long time to get through.  It is an experience and it is what blu-ray is all about and what makes the technology so exciting.  Highest recommendation.
B003UESJHO|5.0|this has to be the most realistic boxing movie i have ever seen Wahlberg took all the hits just like a real fighter he didnt use any stunt double he tookt he punches and he brought the pyshicality to the movie no other actor could have played Micky while no other actor could had played Dicky like Bale has done in this movie. in the movie Dicky is one of the most colorful characters in any movie i have ever seen he did just a magnificent job at playing Dicky they made this movie about two brothers who get through tough times to take each other and make it to the top. hopefully from what ive read that there will be a sequel about the three Gatti fights which is what Wahlberg wants to do. also in the cast is Amy Adams and she brings to the table something different than what she is used to not playing some one so cheerful but playing a fiesty Charlene who is Micky's girlfriend (and future wife)so great she brings some of the sexiness to the screen because you have to admit Amy Adams is sexy. but overall this movie is a must see i have to say its no just about boxing but that is the main focus in this film but its about family get this movie you will not be disapointed.
B004DK5CW4|3.0|While this movie is named \\"Secretariat\\", it really does not have that much to do with the actual horse Secretariat but mostly about the people around him.  As a native Virginian who watched this horse's career with avid interest, I found mistakes and controversies that should have been brought out, i.e., the fact that the Preakness record was actually bested by Secretariat (all those stop watches could not have been wrong) but the stewards' faulty clock was accepted as the official time.  Only the Triple Crown was presented and not the remainder of his racing career.  All in all, however, it was an \\"all right\\" movie.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|A stunningly gorgeous film with some of the most brilliant animation to date; using its fancy visuals to bring to life the wonderful love story of a family who sticks together, which brings forth the best of humanity. Trolls beware; you're about to meet your match.
B003UESJHO|5.0|I wish I'd watched this movie sooner. Of course, I knew of the well-known actors in it, knew of the Academy nominations and wins, but for some reason I didn't catch it till its release through Redbox this week. \\"The Fighter\\" surpassed my expectations.<br /><br />Based on the true story of two small-town brothers, both boxers, \\"The Fighter\\" tells of Micky Ward, a welterweight fighter who got in the ring with Alturo Gatti three times. Although his will and heart became the stuff of legend, it's his struggles at home that make him interesting. His older brother, renowned in their town for having knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard, is now a crack addict whose life is being documented by HBO. While he fights his addictive and narcissistic ways, he also brings down his younger brother who has more realistic chances at a world championship.<br /><br />From Micky's relationship with Charlene, played with surprising toughness by Amy Adams, to his struggles with a controlling mother and interfering sisters, \\"The Fighter\\" ends up showing a lot of empathy for all involved. It is a story of triumph over one's background, one's personal demons, and co-dependency. It is a true ode to what it means to be a fighter in all areas, and Christian Bale deserved his Best Supporting Actor award, as did Melissa Leo her Best Supporting Actress nod. This ranks with \\"Rocky\\" as one of the great sports movies, for its heart, its honesty, and its tale of triumph over adversity.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and I cannot wait to read the rest of the books in the series.     It did not grab me from the first page, or even the first chapter. I had to read 3 or 4 chapters before I really started getting into it. But once it gets rolling, hang on to your seat, because you are in for a wild ride.    The storyline is quite brutal, and quite frankly I am surprised that this is considered a \\"Young Adult\\" book. There's no outright gore that I can remember; the violence is cleaned up a bit. There is no sex here, other than some brief kissing. But there is also no shortage of death and violence. The plot revolves around a fight-to-the-death arena match with 24 contestants ranging in age from 12 to 18. And yes, there are scenes where young people whom I would consider children are killed. So while it didn't bother me, I certainly would not recommend this book to someone who is overly-sensitive to such things. I think some of the later Harry Potter books are pretty dark, but I consider The Hunger Games to be perhaps just a tiny bit more-so.     Having said that, I'm an adult (age 40) and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story is great, the characters both in and out of the arena seem deep and real and other than the initial ramp-up in the beginning, there was never a single dull moment.    The contestants are not cardboard cut-outs for the heroine to knock down, they each have realistic strengths and weaknesses and often surprise the reader with their depth.    The action is well-written, entertaining, and often more than a little heart-wrenching. But even before the action starts, there are deep moral questions to contemplate. The heroine faces emotional challenges and political intrigue before she even gets to the arena.    I don't want to give too much away, but all-in-all, this is a thoroughly enjoyable, but often dark and brutal read. I highly recommend it to adults for sure and teenagers, also, as long as they are not overly empathic. If they can handle the last 3 books in the Harry Potter series, they can probably handle this, as well.
1591843790|5.0|This is one of those books you need to own. You're going to want to re-read it, take notes, tab pages and possibly mark it up. Yes, it's that good.    My full review:  [...]
1607886278|5.0|Just finished the audiobook of \\"Room.\\"  It was a riveting story.  So original!  I was absolutely amazed by the voice artist Michal Friedman as the voice of 5 year old Jack.  Fan-tas-tic!  The inflection in her voice was amazing.  So insightful.  Even if you read the book, do yourself a favor and also enjoy the audiobook version (from the public library as I did?).  You will not be disappointed.  I didn't want the story to end.  Goodbye Room!
030746363X|3.0|I absolutely loved the book, \\"The 4 Hour Work Week.\\" I thought it was breath of fresh air, offering creative and innovative ideas for people to revamp their way of thinking about work. Particularly these days when the economy is so poor, the ideas contained in the book are even more applicable. I also thought that people who were used to a 9-5 world exclusively, would develop an appreciation for what is it like in the independent, entrepreneurial world, and thus think twice about topics like high taxes and excessive spending. That is why I had such high hopes for the follow-up book, \\"The 4 Hour Body.\\"<br /><br />After thoroughly reading it and going back over many sections, I would consider it a mixed bag at best. Some of the ideas are solid and highly useful -- controlling glucose for fat loss, reversing \\"permanent\\" injuries and innovative ways to pay for a hospital stay turned vacation. Implied within some chapters are exceptional messages -- People can do more than what they think, most things (maybe everything?) is correctable and most of all, eat right and get moving. For these, I soundly applaud the author. Exceptional messages!<br /><br />Where I found the booked both disappointing and deeply flawed was in the \\"how\\" portions; that is, the ideas and suggestions that were provided had many problems associated with them and some of the notions that his suggestions were built upon are simply wrong. There were quite a number of them, but allow me to provide 3 examples:<br /><br />1. The use of Cinnamon for everyone, to control blood sugar.<br /><br />A little explanation is needed here. You cannot \\"jam\\" the model of Natural Medicine into the model of Standard Medicine. In very basic terms, Standard Medicine (for the most part) views external pathogens as the problem and looks at what pharmaceutical can be used to kill or at least control it. Antibiotics are the most obvious example. The emphasis is on the drug. As such, it is very common for 10 people to receive the identical pharmaceutical for symptoms that are similar.<br /><br />Natural Medicine looks at the INDIVIDUAL, not just the \\"disease\\" or symptoms and asks the question, \\"What substance(s) can be used to strengthen the constitution so that his/her system can defend itself against said pathogen.\\" The emphasis is on the individual. As such, it is  UNcommon for 10 people to receive the same herb (or other nutrition) for symptoms that are similar. Instead, each person would most likely receive substances unique to their constitution. 10 people. Maybe 8 or 9 different substances.<br /><br />Cinnamon is an herb that is very warming by its nature. As such, it is prescribed to individuals who have issues with cold or cold-based problems (or constitutions). It works beautifully. It is a disaster for individuals whose constitution is warm or hot, and/or have heat-based issues.<br /><br />If a person has any type of  \\"-itis\\" (ex/ colitis) which is a heat based inflammatory, digestive issue, giving them cinnamon would be a disaster. Gasoline to the fire. . . . . One would consider something cooling in nature, like Aloe. Water to the fire. . .<br /><br />Those whose constitution are cool or cold will prosper using Cinnamon to control blood sugar. Those who have a warm or heat-based constitution will over a period of time, suffer issues such as adrenal exhaustion, mineral and trace mineral deficiency, hydration issues and potentially heart-based problems and more. It will end up being a major problem for sure.<br /><br />2. \\"Slow Carb Diet.\\"<br /><br />This is not nearly as problematic as the aforementioned, but it is simply not an accurate one. It is based on the mistaken Glycemic Index theory; that is, some foods are said to have higher or lower GI indexes and evoke  stronger or weaker glucose responses. I could list about 40 different citations here but space constrains do not allow this, so let me list the following:<br /><br />The British J. of Nutrition confirmed prior findings, noting \\". . . There was no association between GI and insulin index or the amount of insulin generated.\\" Ice Cream has a lower GI than a baked potato. Anyone think ice cream is healthier?<br /><br />Bottom line - all that matters (for fat loss) is the net reduction in all types of carbohydrates. If you replace high GI foods with low GI foods in the same amounts, you will get fat. . . just 15-30 minutes later, the time difference between \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" GI foods and insulin responses.<br /><br />3. \\"You can go from running a 5K to a 50K in 12 weeks.\\"<br /><br />That is the claim. Can you really do this?<br /><br />I don't know. What I do know, having done 7 marathons now,  is that the VAST majority are not in any type of shape to do this and even for those that are, this is the ideal prescription for injury and burnout.<br /><br />Also, as I mentioned in my prior blog post on \\"The Misguided Art of Hacking,\\" ([...]) why would you want to? Ultramarathoner Dean Karnazes said it best, \\"There are no shortcuts to excellence.\\"<br /><br />In summary, I would describe this book as a well-meaning, curious case study. The ideas and suggestions appeared to work for the author and may work for those who have a similar or virtually identical constitution, physique, energy level, dedication, determination and mind-set. Should any of these vary, his suggestions could prove to be extremely unhealthy. . . to say the least.of insulin generated.\\" Ice Cream has a lower GI than a baked potato.

B0038Z5SEW|2.0|Since this movie has been reviewed numerous times and most everybody has already viewed it, my two star rating is for its failure on Blu-ray.    The issues are simple:    1. There are no extra features related to the movie.  All you get is the movie.    2. The colors are washed out and gray and the movie is darker than the DVD.  The instant download from Amazon which I streamed through my Blu-Ray player while waiting for the disc to show up had better colors, but not picture.    I've come to expect better quality and more features with Blu-ray although that is not always the case as The Edge proves.    3 stars would make it average.  The lack of extra features and the sullen picture put it below average, hence 2 stars.    The movie has aged well and is still entertaining.  It is just too bad there was not a feature on Bart the Bear, or on the Making of The Edge.
B000MRAAJM|1.0|Ordered Planet Earth on blu ray. Product came really fast, with no problem. Found out right away that I ordered the wrong version and contacted them. They were helpful about their return policy... until I mailed the DVDs back. Then they stopped responding. Emailed lots of times, but no response. Didn't get any refund back at all. Still waiting for a response. Ridiculous.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I have Rachel's other videos as well, and once again with Serpentine, she really delivers!  The yoga section is absolutely fabulous, and has become an intrical part of my workout plan, whether I am bellydancing or not!  All the movements and drills she shows here positively impacts all my dancing, as was the case with her other videos.  I liked this one in particular because it can be used in so many ways.  I LOVED the music, and I fell in love with \\"Whisper Hungarian in my Ear\\" that is used on this DVD.  Rachel does a beautiful dance performance to it.  This DVD is definately worth the money, whether you want to try the yoga flow, the drills, the dancing, or just to see Rachel dance!  I can't wait to see what she does next!
B002MU4NL8|5.0|We originally had this movie on VHS.  Great movie; hilarious!  I believe my wife sold the VHS at a garage sale...  So I wanted to replace it.  The Blu ray itself doesn't have alot of frils but it definitely works!
B004L3AQFG|4.0|127 Hours is a movie based on actual events of a man who found himself trapped by a boulder in a remote Utah canyon. The majority of the movie is Aron Ralston(played by Franco)coping with being trapped. The movie includes some beautiful scenery shots by Director Danny Boyle. In order to give the viewers a better idea of what's going through Ralston's head and take you out of the canyon,there are several flashbacks and daydreams, along with a diary which he video tapes. It's not an eventful movie really, so if that's what you are hoping for you may want to just rent this one. It is a movie with some beautiful camera work and good acting from Franco, that shows how powerful the will to live can be, even when things look hopeless. This is a movie that sets out to inspire and move you, not so much entertain you. Somehow it managed to do all three for me.
0061914177|1.0|This book contains no new information.  It is nothing but empty cheerleading to have passion.  You will not close this book any closer to success or passion.

B004QPOVE6|4.0|This new release is the first live concert CD/DVD release of any kind for the 2008-2010 Black Ice Tour. I've seen the trailer. Looks really cool. And it's ACDC so what more do you want.
0312370849|5.0|I did not know much about French Holocaust until I read about this book. From the little girl, Sarah,'s point of view, I was able to learn about the event step by step. Also as Julia, a journalist, learns about the Vel' d'Hiv, she adds more information to what Sarah has given. A great book, easy to understand especially to those who didn't know about the Vel' d'Hiv.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Pros:   This is one of the best coolers for the money. It's cooling an AMD Phenom X2 with 2 extra cores unlocked and overclocked to 3.6Ghz.  I tried 2 different aftermarket coolers but they are having a hard time cooling my cpu under load. Temps always reach 65C+ running on Prime95 for just an hour thus leading to a system reboot. =(  With this cooler, I ran Prime95 for 4 hours and the maximum temp only reached 51C. Two thumbs up for Cooler Master on this product.   Cons:  Check clearance first if you have a memory(RAM) with high heatsinks. With my G. Skill Ripjaws, I couldn't use the 1st slot. No problem with low profile one though  Installation can be a little tricky for some. In my case, I have to remove my mobo and took my time for a better install. Btw, be careful with the fin edges, they are a little sharp.
B002VRZEYM|1.0|Michael Pollan and his cohorts are activists against agriculture, along with the likes of HSUS, who want to destroy the food production system in the U.S.  The ability to feed our population, both at home and abroad, cannot rely solely on locavore efforts.  od
B003CIG7AE|2.0|Like many people, I fell in love with Band of Horses when [[ASIN:B000YN32BM Is There a Ghost]] was kicking around the scene. With Infinite Arms, the band's 3rd album (first on a major label), the lyrics seem more purposed than their previous albums. As other reviewers have noted, the tone of the album is more subdued and mellow. While some claim that's also maturation and evolution of the band, I strongly disagree as in several cases it just sounds lazy, dropping harmonies and cord complexities in favor of shallower, simpler sounds. On the upside, the sound editing and mixing is much better this time.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether to blame the band, if this &#34;effort&#34; (if it can be called that) was a deliberate decision by the artists, or whether to throw this at Columbia's feet. Either way, BOH is undeniably in there, this release just sounds a little lazy and lackluster compared to their other two stellar albums.
B000V7O0IA|5.0|Well, guys, don't think of this movie only as a \\"chick flick\\" movie.  It is a good people movie and has a good story as well as to why something strange in time is happening to these two people.    It was well written, well directed, and well acted.
B000002LAB|2.0|I felt that the electronic instruments were not well integrated into the music. It felt forced and uninteresting. There also seemed to be a lack of verity that I would normally here from Davis' music. I was underwhelmed.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|This is the most impressive piece of artwork I've explored for a long time. I don't know her previous work as much, but the complexity and the mature artistic expression of it are profound. Substantial art finding its original place between heaven and earth. Only very good artists on their zenith can create like this.    I could write about the details and the style and instrumental qualities of this music - or rather poetry -, but this art is about way more. Those formal expressions are truly just serving the purpose of an artistic revelation. If you can free yourself from the style of music and enjoy any high level art you should not miss this one!    (There's a similarly profound concept album dealing with the 1st World War in Hungarian with an obvious different national coloring regarding the music and the lyrics: Bakaballada (Soldier's ballad) by Hobo and Ghymes - in case someone understands that language. Stunning how despite the obvious artistic, cultural differences they evoke a very similar emotional \\"atmosphere\\".)    Peace.
0440238609|5.0|This series is original and thought provoking. I personally love these books, I'm just sorry I waited so long to finally read them! True emotion, creative ideas, and great characters make this an excellent trilogy. Most of the negative reviews here have less to do with the writing and story and more to do with intolerant Christians that can't handle people having beliefs contrary to their own. As long as you are openminded and enjoy fantasy you will love this story.<br /><br />Now about the actual books themselves, I probably would not choose this box set if I had it to do over, because the books are quite small and as a result the font size is tiny and it is harder to open the books fully. I would choose some of the larger sized paperbacks, which are more comfortable to read.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|my daughter loves cats so she was thrilled when this movie arrived, she loves the music and the characters, its a great addition to any movie collection
B0000AK7AB|5.0|Does anyone remember seeing a movie called BABE?  Maybe about 15 years, or so,  ago?  It is a story about Babe, a pig who is raised by sheepdogs, and learns to herd sheep, with a little help from Farmer Hoggett, played by James Cromwell.     I have never been able to forget that mean cat in this movie who said to Babe, \\"You don't have a purpose.\\"     Worse than that? The look on Babe's face when she realized she had no purpose - that was a killer. Babe was perfectly happy before being asked that question but suddenly was so deflated. That cat was really a rotten cat! Or was she? Maybe Babe needed this incident, cruel as it was, to make her desire a purpose!      There is a wonderful barnyard filled with animals, all with a purpose. All delightful. Do you remember James Cromwell, the farmer?     I am writing a story on Finding Your Purpose and using the song James Cromwell sang . . . If I Had Words. I think seeing this scene reminds me of how excited GOD might have been right after he created Adam. Having foreknowledge does not mean you can't be happy and excited (in the moment) when something wonderful happens.  Cromwell has dust on his finger nails from working on the farm; the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground so would he have had dust on his fingernails?  Imagine that!     This movie, aside from entertaining, made me think a lot about having a purpose and what my purpose was. What a great teaching tool that was for me! Everyone is born with a purpose and gifted for that purpose from his or her mother's womb. We often miss it but we wander around a lifetime until we find it - that is,  if we keep seeking for happiness and being fully alive.     God gave Adam a purpose right off - he gives us all a purpose built in - a chip?  maybe in the soul?  maybe?  But he gave us a purpose and will have given us the gifts to fulfill that purpose.  We should all look for that purpose!     One day, maybe today,  he will rejoice over us with singing -  Zephaniah 3:17 The LORD, your God, is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory; he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you* in his love; he will exult over you with loud singing as on a day of festival.     Surely he will when we find our purpose and use it.    Go track down If I Had Words and be entertained by James Cromwell.
B003F3NDWG|4.0|I don't spend much or anytime watching extras on DVD's; in fact those things hold little importance with me. This DVD set is for fans, of which I count myself. If you are unfortunate enough not to be a fan, yet, then why are you reading this? Go watch a few episodes then buy this set and season one. This show offers a wide range of entertainment: Comedy, few, if any, touch Fillion for his wry and geeky touch to the story and timing - Oh and by the way, Katic holds her own in this area aptly; Drama, hard hitting general and personal subjects are well done; Gross anatomy, Doctor shows don't do it for me but do for my wife, this show satisfies because there's just enough med here to make her very interested; Chemistry, It has been a verrrry long time since I've seen 2 costars that I'd like to see get \\"together\\" on screen; Last, Nathan Fillion - ruggedly hansome, yeah & Stana Katic - HOT, need I say more.
0756404738|5.0|Forget trying to compare him to Tolkien, Rowling, or even Martin.  It's not a carbon copy, it's not a modification, and it certainly is not poetry.  The Kingkiller Chronicle defies the potency of any summary I can think to draw for you here.  Though, I can hardly imagine any song more worth hearing, a translation of Rothfuss' work here is beyond my 'waking mind'.      The Wise Man's Fear is a literary seduction worth the wait, plucking the strings of its readers with the knowing of a long-familiar instrument and yet still capturing the wild and strange and free pitch only a magical musician might hope to accomplish.  A beautiful game indeed, sir.
B0034KHFM4|5.0|Wow got it for a real low price and all the songs are excellent as expected but i didnt like downloading the amazon mp3 downloader.
B0034G4ORM|3.0|One thing you can say for Battle: Los Angeles - the film delivers exactly what the trailer promises:  lots of jarring, rousing combat action in a sci-fi alien invasion setting where you always know exactly what's going to happen and all of the characters are the same stock ones you've seen time and again in countless other war films ever since John Wayne hit The Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) and James Cagney learned What Price Glory? (1952).<br /><br />There's no point going into detail on the plot.  I mean, how many ways are there to say 'marine platoon fights alien invaders in urban setting'?<br /><br />And while the talented cast - Aaron Eckhart (Rabbit Hole, The Dark Knight), Michelle Rodriguez (Avatar), Michael Pena (Crash, TV's The Shield), Jim Parrack (TV's True Blood) and others - do a fine job with the roles they're given, the script calls up just about every possible cliched war movie character there is: Cliche #1, the grizzled sergeant haunted by memories of men he lost (who also happens to be Cliche #2, the soldier who was just on the verge of getting out of the service when the crap hits the fan and he's pulled back into duty). Cliche #3, the green lieutenant who has to be taken in hand (who also serves as Cliche #4, the soldier whose pregnant wife is about to have their first child). Cliche #5, the virginal baby-faced private who you know from the moment you see him is a dead man walking. Cliche #6, the soldier who's about to get married when the crap hits the fan. Cliche #7, the soldier who carries a grudge against the sergeant for a brother he lost. Cliche #8, the plucky female marine from the air wing who kicks serious butt. Cliche #9, the medic everyone calls 'Doc' who hopes to become a real doctor some day. Cliches #10a & 10b, the civilian boy whose father ends up dying and asking the sergeant to promise to save his son. About the only cliches missing are the prostitute with the heart of gold and the idiotic staff officer who gets people killed from sheer stupidity (though even money will get you that they're probably on the cutting room floor somewhere).<br /><br />On the plus side, when the action is moving, Battle: Los Angeles is great and you completely forget about the predictability and the cliches (a considerable accomplishment, all things considered). Though highly derivative of both Independence Day and District 9 (and Saving Private Ryan for that matter), Battle: Los Angeles does have a gritty, realistic feel to it and the tension is palpable and constantly being jacked up. The movie does a good job of getting the feel of what it would probably be like for a marine unit with conventional weapons having to fight off attacking aliens with otherworld tech. The moving camera effects do make things confusing and hard to follow at times, but given the often chaotic nature of actual combat, this actually adds to the overall realism. And frankly, this film really needs the chaos and the breakneck pacing because if you ever stop to think about what's happening, you start to ask questions that make everything fall apart.<br /><br />As it is, there are too many poignant lulls in the action where various characters must reinforce their cliches with emotive speeches or declarations. It's those moments that make you start wanting to pick up the nearest weapon and join the aliens in shooting at them if only to make them stop talking and start moving again.  Even Aaron Eckhart, who otherwise does an excellent job of bringing some life to the cliched character he's been given to play, succumbs to this in an over-the-top emotive recitation of the names and stats of all the men he lost that goes on so long that all of the other characters are left with nothing to do but stand and wait until he's done (for some reason, the aliens never attack while characters are emoting, even though you wish they would).<br /><br />Only slightly less annoying are the moments when the talking-heads of experts appear on the news to explainwhy the aliens are doing all of this. The reality is that the audience for this kind of film doesn't need to know and in fact doesn't care why the aliens are invading; they just want to see the good guys kicking alien butt. Especially since the ostensible object of the invasion (our water?) turns out to be something so stupid it feels like it belongs in a satire like Dr. Strangelove rather than what's supposed to be a serious movie. On hearing it, all I could think about was Colonel Jack D. Ripper's famous rant about Commies going after \\"our precious bodily fluids\\".<br /><br />It is in fact the talking heads that point out the movie's core fallacy.  They claim that the aliens' objective is one of colonization and that this requires killing off 'the indigenous population' (i.e. humanity). If that were so, then _why_ would they bother with a standard military invasion (air cover, bombardment, establishing beachheads, sending in ground units, etc) when they could accomplish a great deal of the same goal with almost no risk at all?  I mean, they're coming from _outer_space_!  In the words of Robert A. Heinlein who had the idea over fifty years ago, all they'd have to do is 'drop rocks on us'.  A few well-targeted asteroids nudged in our direction and hitting the ocean would've wiped most of coastal California clean before the first alien ship would reach the ground.  Think the recent tsunami in Japan (and the one a few years ago that hit Thailand and Indonesia) and then multiple that a hundred times over.  Think dinosaur extinctions. Of course, that wouldn't make for much of a war movie. Plus the fact that that particular movie's really already kind of been done (Deep Impact - 1998).  Like I said, you really don't want any lulls in the movie where you can start thinking about things like this.<br /><br />But all that said, if you like adrenaline-pumping scifi combat action films and can handle putting the rest of your brain on auto-pilot for two hours, then I can recommend Battle: Los Angeles as worth seeing. It's a good high-tension ride for the most part, even if the ending is as suspension-of-disbelief hokey as Independence Day and admittedly most other films of this sub-genre tend to be.The reality is that the audience for this kind of film doesn't need to know and in fact doesn't care why the aliens are invading; they just want to see the good guys kicking alien butt.

B000HEWEDK|5.0|Great scifi classic to add for a collection<br />The bonus dvd portraying more of Robbie the Robot<br />Are great too
B004DMNT2W|5.0|I use this case with the Canon HF100 and both it's regular and extended life batteries. With the very large (generic BP-827) extended life battery the case zips very snuggly around the camera, with the regular battery it fits much more comfortably in the case, but either will work with it. The case has excellent build quality. The multipurpose strap can be a belt loop, hand grip, or hanging strap, depending on how it's attached with the Velcro point at the bottom. The case is well padded and with an elastic band inside the top opening, it holds it's shape very well. The zipper pull also inspires confidence with a looped cord and rubber grip. The only accessories the case allows for is 2 SD sized cards. All these features make it the perfect compact day bag for your diminutive camcorder. However, it also limits it from being your only bag since you cannot fit your charger, extra batteries, lights, adapters, cables, etc. that you might need if you were going on vacation (unless you carried these items separately of course).<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Small size encourages bringing the video camera along.<br />+ Great build quality.<br />+ Just big enough to fit small flash based cameras with extended battery.<br />+ Room for two extra SD or Memory Stick cards.<br />+ Strong and padded for protection.<br />+ Versatile strap.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- No room for accessories that would be needed for a longer trip.<br />- The rigidity of the case keeps it from compressing flat to be stored empty in luggage.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Did not see this in theaters back in the day. But I rented, then bought DVD , now upgraded to blu. If you have not seen I recommend watching original version first. Blu ray has different version that paints a slightly different picture. Really liked the original.
B0041VIJQG|1.0|This is terrible.  The album he made with Alison Krauss was even worse.  Ever since he and Jimmy Plant broke up it seems like Plant is trying to scratch out a vibe or a direction to find where his voice belongs.  Logically speaking he NEEDS to get back into the studio with Jimmy, John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham because that's where his voice belongs.  NONE of his subsequent singing, after leaving LZ, have ever showed the fire and passion that he is well known for and respected as well.  RP, if you are reading this, please call Jimmy Page as soon as possible!
B0018QOIXU|2.0|Going against the flow here...don't much care for this album.  There are certainly glimmers of talent though.  Her voice reminds me a bit of Sharon Little.  My daughter likes '21' better and usually knows what she's talking about so I'll have to check that one out.
0756404738|5.0|This book is phenomenal. I love it as passionately as the first book and for the same reasons: Good language, great characters, unuasual (=fresh) and very skillful storytelling.     And I am a bit surprised at the ambiguous reception The Wise Man´s Fear is getting at the moment, so I wondered why that is. I think people had certain expectations towards this book that were not met. This book doesn´t actually cover a lot of time, maybe two years. People expected the overall plot about the Chandrian to advance a significant amount. But I don´t think that´s the real heart of the story. At the heart of it are the wonderful musings, descriptions and dialogues. There is so much beauty, humour, sadness and also simply interesting thought in this book, that I cannot really understand how anyone can be disappointed by it. An example (just one sentence, no spoiler, except if you wish to discover these little gems on your own): \\"Tell me what I want to know or God will weep when he sees what I have done to you\\".     Another thing that could throw people off, but which I for one enjoy like a fresh summer breeze, is the unusual structure of the story. And I´m not talking about the brackets and interludes in the Inn. I´m talking about the fact that this is not the typical three act story line. There´s no arc for large parts of the book. I don´t know how to describe the story structure, but I enjoyed it. I was constantly gripped and fascinated by each new emerging aspect. For example (again spoilerfree): Kvothe finishes something on point A and you expect him to go straight back where he came from (point B), but something happens on the way and he wont get back to point B for several hundred pages.     Many people seem to agree that they were captivated by this book, loved its content, are looking forward to book 3 and intend to buy it on release date... and then proceed to give The Wise Man´s fear a 3 star rating, because it wasn´t what they expected. If I read somethingunexpected that I love, I am even more happy about it then I would be if I read something I expected all along. So I can´t follow that logic.      So, in closing: If you liked The Name Of The Wind because of it´s characters, it´s beautiful language and great storytelling, then don´t be afraid. The Wise Man´s Fear is, if anything, even better.
1439102724|5.0|I have read all of Jodi Picoult's books and \\"Sing You Home\\" is one of her best!  I just finished reading the book and I am truly inspired by her willingness to focus her books on the most controversial topics.  The key to Jodi Picoult is that she presents ALL sides of the controversy.  She even likes to present more than one controversial topic in her book.  This book examines infertility, gay rights, religious freedom and depression.  Jodi Picoult's extensive research from all points of view on this topic creates a story that helps you connect with characters from views similar to your own, but also open your mind to characters who hold your opposing view.  In today's society, it is important for all people to have compassion and to respect all humankind no matter what gender, race, ethnicity or sexual identity.  I have a hard time believing that the God I know would agree that people treat others with such hate and anger because they do not agree with their lifestyle.  Thank you, Jodi Picoult, for once again opening the door to acceptance and more understanding to those who have previously had the door shut and locked.
B003EY7IRC|2.0|I have been absolutely enthralled by the first four books, so much so that I got my daughter the books for Christmas and was looking forward to giving her Shadowfever for her birthday in February. We both had the same reaction...very, very disappointed, borderline annoyed after investing so much emotional energy into this. It was as if KMM just threw a bunch of stuff into a pot just to get finished, without any regard as to whether it made sense. Too many things happened that seemed to come out of the blue, with no foreshadowing and the ending was COMPLETELY unexpected, only it wasn't the kind of \\"unexpected\\" that happens when you realize you've missed subtle cues along the way (i.e., The Sixth Sense); it was the \\"unexpected\\" as in \\"completely blindsided.\\"    I regret spending the money on this.

1439152780|4.0|Story is engrossing and has many layers; the author does a fine job of painting a haunting and creepy landscape for her story.  There are lots of directions the reader thinks the plot may go, but then twists in another direction.  I found it suspensfull, but I was not totally invested with the narrator, Edie, she sort of stands outside the plot as an observer.  I wish there had been an \\"ah, ha\\" moment when she discovered more of a connection to the castle.  And I never really understood her mother Meredith's angst about talking of her time there.  Still don't understand why she kept it all a secret, and I can't even remember if the reader ever does find out what was so upsetting about receiving the letter from Juniper after so many years.    I would actually give this 3.5 stars - but rounded up to 4 because it was a pleasant book to go to every night to read; but did leave me a little unsatisfied.
B004DMNT2W|5.0|The Lowepro Digital Video Case 30 for Camcorders (Black) is not going to work for your Canon XL-2 or that old VHS home movie camcorder. A quick look at the dimensions will quickly tell you that. But, if you are looking for a great little case for your \\"Flip\\" video camera, a Canon FS 100 or similar small format video camera, this is a great little case. It is well padded, has a full length zipper and interior pocket for memory cards. The case fits nicely in the palm of your hand and will tuck easily into a suitcase, briefcase or purse.
0316044938|5.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is just what the title implies, a juxtaposition of what horrifies us and attracts us to life as human beings. The novel throws together a serial killer and a young girl blossoming into womanhood and in doing so shows us a bit about ourselves, our capacities and our inclinations, both noble and despicable. We are immersed in a world of very human and very real characters without the benefit of rose-colored glasses, a 12-step program or a Hollywood plot.<br /><br />The book follows Susie Salmon's view of the world after her murder at the hands of a serial killer. She enters an ethereal world she calls her own personal heaven. There she and other departed souls observe activity on Earth and contemplate their own future. Most of the novel's action revolves around attempts by Susie's family to deal with her death and the police investigation that follows it. Herein, the beauty of Sebold's insight comes to fruition. In the daily life, the small details, the on-going needs of the living, we come to know and love both Susie and her troubled family. In time, the horror of the murder blends seamlessly with the eternal joy of living. We see perspectives of this in the earthly events as well as in Susie's Heaven.<br /><br />To know the story of Susie Salmon is to know a human life in all of its complexities, pains and beauty.

B0034G4OY0|5.0|It's almost shocking that Clint Eastwood, at his age, is still crafting such risky, memorable and important films like \\"Hereafter.\\"<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's \\"Hereafter\\" is great in every way a movie should be great. The characters are layered, psychologically complex and always interesting. The performances are natural, restrained and effective. The writing it timely, thoughtful and intricate. The story is deep and probing without being melodramatic or overly sentimental. The directing is stylish, calculated and visually arresting. \\"Hereafter\\" is a fantastic film, and I'm not entirely sure why it's being met with such hatred. Sure, the film has a slow pace but that shouldn't deter it's effect, for me, it enhances it. \\"Hereafter\\" may be a somber experience but it's Eastwood at his most thought provoking, emotional, and daring. Certainly one of my favorite films from 2010.<br /><br />It's also quite refreshing to see Matt Damon in such a restrained performance, he too, like Eastwood, keeps turning out surprising work. If you are a fan of serious minded, thought provoking and emotionally relevant filmmaking, please support \\"Hereafter.\\"
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Abby is, to all appearances, a young girl of about 12 or so.  She arrives in a small New Mexico town in the early '80s and takes up residence in the apartment next to that of Owen, a lonely, bullied young boy whose isolation and anger are just beginning to twist him in ways that Abby may find useful.  See, the man who appears to be Abby's father isn't: he's more like her Renfield.  And as much as he loves Abby, he's beginning to grow old, and the cost of keeping her fed is taking a heavy toll on him.<br /><br />Abby is a vampire trapped in the body of a child, and she has a problem: soon, she'll need a new caregiver.  And Owen is looking like a good prospect.<br /><br />LET ME IN is a quietly effective horror film done the way horror used to be done, with great subtlety and quiet seduction.  It draws its audience to it the way that Abby draws Owen to her, a little bit at a time, letting the tension build and then revealing itself in slow stages.<br /><br />This was an excellent movie.  Do not miss it.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|This movie is awesome. Usually a movie gets kinda run down after the 2hr mark but this movie kept me and my family interest throughout the 3hr mark and left us in awe. Its hard to follow if you dont pay attention to it. Buy it on standard dvd because the sellers on here are selling it way to high for a blu-ray movie. i won't go into any detail as to all the reviewers have done that. buy this movie without hesitation
1844256383|4.0|This book is nothing like the Haynes repair books that have those rudimentary b+w photos/drawings that they publish for repairing your vehicle.  It is hands down the best book on saxophone repairs that I have ever seen.  It has excellent descriptions and full color pictures outlining the many details of repairing saxophones.  The first half of the book is a buyers guide reflecting the opinions of the author and the second half gives you a detailed description on almost every facet of saxophone repair.  My only complaint is that it is written by a British author which means that the buyers guide and the list of suppliers is not always indicative to the American market.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|An exhausting & insightful visit into the world of captivity.  Engrossing & endearing (mainly due to the innocence of our narrator, 5 year-old Jack) I was completely drawn in.  Great read!
0439023521|5.0|i am a high school and college theatre teacher/director. some of my students were reading this book and suggested i try it.  i found it to be a great story, one that was difficult to put down and filled with believable characters. i, too, am a writer  and seem to demand a lot from a story. it must flow, action must be constant and there should be no \\"down time.\\" this book  has all of this and more. i recommend this for high school kids and their parents alike.

1423101502|3.0|I liked all the action and how there was a little romance in the novel, like at the beginning, but then after the fighting stopped and right at the end, I felt like something was missing. I mean okay, Percy and Annabeth kiss, but then they run after each other. I mean this whole series was leading up to the romance, so you would think that when they finally got to the romance, it would have been a bit more then just what it was. I mean even if after the ending, he could have said something else that would have explained more, like how their life continued or something that tells us a little more about their future and their romance or something like how Percy got rid of his invinsibility or if he just lived with it.  It just felt like a bit of a let down since the whole series led up to it and then once it finally happened, he didn't even tell us much about it. I mean the ending is one of the most important parts of the book, and he just doesn't describe how everything is going to be.  If posible he should make another series about Percy grown up and his life after this book ends.
0143116177|1.0|The book you see in the pictures is not the book they are going to send you,  The book they will send you is printed on cheap paper in black and white. Spent $22.00 on this book, really hate being riped-off.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|From the beginning with the Police Sting's songs and his voice were very special and very present...<br />On this DVD (and CD) I know many songs by heart, but I'm very impressed by the fresh and craftfull voice of Sting with the splendid accompaniment of the whole orchester and all the solist singer, saxophonist, gitarplayer, rythmicsection etc., who make this concert with many different and everytime changing songs to a splendid event.<br />I was very surpriced!!!
B003J27WFW|5.0|Beyond... is a masterful film documentary. Interesting throughout, and well-paced. Some things that were edited for the pace of the film happily appear on the 2nd disc, so they're not lost to a cutting-room floor.    Even my wife, who hates Rush, loved the film. It is deeply human, at times hilarious, and very moving. Plus there are plenty of musical clips, details behind the formation of each album, tour, and numerous individual songs.    A warning to parents - there are a few F-bombs dropped, and Gene Simmons (of the band Kiss) is interviewed, and gets rather crude at one point.    Five stars easily.
B000063TE5|4.0|I'm a huge fan of this album with all of it's little details and things that you only hear after listening to it multiple times. The record format for this album lets you hear everything as if for the first time. I'm a sucker for this vinyl and it's difficult for me to say anything critical about it.     You should buy it.

0316069485|2.0|This is an entertaining book, which is exactly what a potboiler should be. But it appears Mr. Connelly wrote himself into a corner, realized he didn't know how to end the story, and just threw up his hands and decided to quit writing. Too bad.

B002ZNJW0O|4.0|This book takes you on a slow meandering journey through the relationships involving friendships and family and the various degrees of love one experiences in each relationship.  Like all Nicholas Sparks' books his characters are thoroughly enjoyable and well defined.  It wraps up a little fast, but you will love spending time with the characters of this book. If you are after a fast pace story this is not for you, but if you want to curl up with a nice hot cuppa and some chocolate or soak in a long warm bath then pick up this book and lose yourself.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|The Lost Hero starts off with Jason, Piper and Leo as they are carted to 'wilderness camp' a place for 'bad kids' and Jason has amnesia. Soon after arriving at the Grand Canyan the three are attacked by Venti and thier camp consular (who is actually a satyr) is abducted. Magically they are whisked to Camp Half-Blood, and thus begins thier adventure.<br /><br />The Lost Hero brings back alot of what the Percy Jackson series introduced: Greek Gods, nasty monsters and great quests. Hera is stolen and a great evil is about to be unleashed, its up to Jason, Piper and Leo to save the day. The action really never stops in the book and i think thats why i am so in love with Riordans writting style, its always exciting and keeps you guessing.<br /><br />This time we are also introduced to the Roman aspects of the Greek gods, while this is a nice change.. it was a little confusing, and i am far more interesting in the Greek aspects rather than Roman. It does however, add an extra bit of flaire towards the end when it all gets metted out and the story really gets interesting.<br /><br />Jason is supposidly the hero of this book but i found myself liking Leo alot more, sure hes a clown but hes a loyal one and his backstory is trajic and i just wanted to hug him. Piper is also interesting, her backstory isnt nearly so tragic but still good. The host of new campers adds charm and we get to see some old favorites: Chiron, Rachel, Annabeth.. however someone is missing.. Percy! Thats right, no Percy this round, but im sure he will show up eventually. The Lost hero has all the goodness of the Percy Jackson, plus a sixty foot bronze dragon. If you enjoyed the Percy Jackson series your sure to enjoy this one.

1594202842|5.0|As a piano teacher I see this all the time.  The Asian kids are the ones winning all the competitions.  Why? because the caucasians won't work as hard and don't have mothers who make them practice as hard.  We have become a nation of wimpy parents who are raising overindulged kids.  If we want to compete with the rest of the world academically and musically we are going to have to get rid of our current, very destructive, parenting philosophy.  Americas kids are ending up as lazy, overweight, video game addicts.  Moms (myself included) need to toughen up, get to work, and incorporate a little of Chua's drive for perfection in their children or we are going to find ourselves and our education system on the same level with Mexico.

B004R36QUE|5.0|I agree with most of what people say however I want to take a little more time with Geoffrey Rushs portrayal of the speech coach.Like a basketball player who hands off fifty assists ,this movie would not be the same  without Rush.As moving and Superb as Colin Firth is,it the astonishing \\"assists\\" that Rush delivers framing every move by Firth with magic, which make this such a fine film (that and Beethoveens Seventh)Imagine ,there are other superb actors who could have done Firths role,though I am not at all trying to take away from his beautiful job  .THere is NO one who could have handled Logues character and brought the humanity depth,humour,and \\"supporting\\" role necessary for this to truly fly quite the way Mr.Rush did.And so why didn't he get best supporting actor.I don't think I have ever seen a movie where someone so richly deserved it.But then again he is always a class act ,whether in the heart rending end of \\"Shine\\" for which he won a best actor award.It probably doesn't bother him because he is that good.It just annoys me,I am relieved it won the other awards as it is a momentary return to understated elegance in acting,superb ensemble play,incredible staging and scenery historically fascinating. in a way that is a throwback to filmmaking that is real and intensely moving.In a general culture of sham entertainment ,ten second wonders,and infinite bad taste ,this movie is a simple revelation of the highest degrees of professionalism and true entertainment.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|I missed this movie when it was shown at theaters so wanted to see it as soon as it was available and Amazon came through great on this. I just watched it and feel the beauty of Clint Eastwood Direction: Actors; Screenplay; as well as the cinematic team he brings together regularly in his varied \\"Art\\" films.    I love this film. I am very interested in \\"life after death\\" as well as a life lived fully \\"aware and awake\\".  The film beautifully and abstractly shines light on many subjects including people's experiences/stories and finding their way.  Magnificently done. Kudos and Many thanks Mr. Eastwood and Team for making this significant film which is an \\"Art\\" work with so many layers.  Highly recommend this film.

B001LRJH0K|3.0|We were looking forward to viewing this movie because we had enjoyed the book, written in the last few years of Parker's life.  We were disappointed.      The story trudged along like a marathon runner who was back in the pack and had little reason for celebration.      I have always respected Ed Harris' work, but I do not think that he allowed himself to be more than a one dimensional character.  Renee Zelweiger was miscast as the cheating valueless, woman who really gave no reason for Cole or anyone else to be so infatuated. She, also, has shown herself to be capable of much more. Viggo Mortenson did turn in a fine performance, but I do not think that it was good enough to rescue this the movie.    I think that I am being a bit generous in rating this as ordinary (three stars), but I guess it was not a total wast of our two hours.     North Bay Bill
B002XTBE6K|1.0|For an average television production this is adequate. Beautiful costumes, beautiful settings, adequate acting. But as a televisions adaptation of Emma by Jane Austin I am simply shocked that this program has received so many good reviews. Why? The story does not adhere to the book. There is so much artistic license that at times I think that the writers have no sense of the spirit of Emma at all. The characters are not true to their literary nature. I could go on criticizing but I actually don't enjoy putting the creative efforts of others down. If you are looking for an entertaining period drama this is great. If you are looking for Emma you won't find her here. The writers are primarily at fault. Then the Director. Then the primary actors... in that order. If this were any old period flic I would give it a three star rating. As a adaptation of Emma by Jane Austin I wish I could give it a zero... a one star had to suffice.

B00008CLOA|3.0|As one other reviewer wrote, I'm not a big Pink Floyd fan either.  This is the only album of their work that I actually liked every track on it and, it is their best masterpiece.  Maybe for that reason, I didn't care for the rest of their releases because it can't be topped.<br /><br />Call me old fashined but I prefer the original vinyl LP of the album to this one.  I honestly miss the traditional pop and hiss noises that are inherent on vinyl.  I feel analog gives you better sound than digital although digital has given us music that is highly portable.  The best one could do in my generation was to make a cassette/reel-to-reel of well loved vinyls.<br /><br />Also, the album art didn't really need to be updated.  That was one of the coolest things about the album is that prism refracting light.  Plastic CD/cassette cases really don't do album art justice.  Would we have noticed all the neat things and faces that Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band album has in it if it was shrunk for a CD/cassette case?  I don't think so.<br /><br />If this is your first experience with this album, you will probably enjoy it just as much as I did the original release.  As for me, I'm sticking with the original release.  Some things should not be tampered with, remade or whatever the hell is done with it.  Why attempt to remake perfection?

B00008G7UF|5.0|The editorial reviewer from amazon knows absolutely nothing about the elements of making a good movie! This movie is funny and sweet from start to finish. Filled with memorable lines throughout, from Meg Ryan's \\"I just ate that cow\\" to Kevin Kline's \\"Don't ever touch my vine\\" This is the type of movie that never gets old. It's one movie in my collection that rarely collects dust!

B000SEHJGQ|5.0|As an Angelino, there's a part of me that has always returned to Charles Bukowski(and \\"Ham on Rye\\" in particular) when I needed a much needed lift from the occasional overload of this megalopolis. Bukowski offers me a way to view my city and my world to some extent, through the prism of another no less difficult but perhaps more intriguing time that perhaps still exists somewhere right here within the confines of my own L.A.  To make ruminating on these matters even better? How about if just for a little while I view it through the masterful, epic, sarcastic and humorous skew which I used to think belonged solely to Charles Bukowski? That's a little bit of heaven right there.<br /><br />Sometimes you'll hear people call something \\"authentic Bukowski\\" or \\"the real Bukowski\\" which means that we who already \\"get it\\" know what it is we're defining without necessarily laying down that definition. It's an irreverence, a humor darkly, a sharp wit, an acute eye....the list is long and each reviewer would necessarily add his or her own pieces to that puzzle. I'm hitting this book with 5 stars and there's more than enough reviewing in here to tell you why - it's sad, it's hilarious, it's \\"authentic Bukowski.\\" To be indoctrinated into that understanding you need go no further than to hit the \\"BUY\\" button.<br /><br />So yes, 5 stars and \\"BUY.\\" Also since I review a lot and the Bukowski audience is a special one into which there is quite literally no new material flowing I have a recommendation. I read, recently reviewed and loved the novel \\"The Nimrod\\" by Mark Kelliher. If Bukowski and Vonnegut got together in heaven and collaborated on a work, \\"The Nimrod\\" would almost certainly be that book. So there's my two for one review of similar works. Check them BOTH out. You won't be disappointed.[[ASIN:B0049U47M4 The Nimrod]]

0316098337|5.0|Although I attempted to write this review with no explicit spoilers, I may have implied more than was intended. For those who have not yet read Room, please do read it. Among other things, the novel reveals aspects of human nature and perception that we often take for granted.  But, if you have yet to read Room, continue reading my review at your own risk.    ---      Emma Donoghue's Room, narrated through the perspective of Jack, a five year-old boy raised in utter isolation from the outside world, is a realistic and moving.  The anthropomorphized \\"Room,\\" as well as the anthropomorphized objects within it, taking on attributes assigned by Jack's imagination, demonstrate how knowledge and perspective are entirely context-based. This is particularly evident through examples of contrast in the last section of the novel, \\"Living.\\" The rejection Jack perceives in regard to how he sees the world and his place in it is easily sympathized with by the reader.  As identity is a universal, yet highly personal, struggle, I feel Room can be enjoyed by a variety of readers of different backgrounds.    While reading this poignant novel, I was often struck by how Room could be used in English classrooms to teach perspective, specifically the perspectives that outsiders may have to mainstream life. In schools, different worldviews are often taught along cultural lines, but Room's example of a child raised in isolation within the Western culture demonstrates that perspective and worldview are more basic and primal than they are often taught. Jack is precocious and engaged in his new world, but he lacks the contextual knowledge to effortlessly fit in. This idea can be extrapolated to microcosms within societies. For instance, in schools, differences in cultural contexts and perspectives can be highlighted among the stratification of school cliques. While this next point is a tangent to the review, teaching Room and context-based perspectives made me think of an activity in which groups of students agree on upholding arbitrary taboos (such as not saying a word that begins with the letter H, not saying hi to every individual member of a group before sitting down with group, not tucking in one's shirt, etc.), then having individual students completely unaware of the taboos join groups and be treated with polite hostility until they ask the right questions to figure out the taboo. Through this activity, students would have more nuanced perspectives about how outsiders must learn to navigate within new contexts.     Regardless of teaching applications, Room is a worthwhile read for any reader. Despite the monstrous events which brought Jack into Room, he learns how to be a sensitive and caring person. Along the way, I think the readers can empathize with Jack in some of these lessons of humanity and learn about themselves and how tolerant they are to different people.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Critically-acclaimed horror films are a rare sight. Rarer still when they star a 95 lb ballerina. Darren Aronofsky's newest film, Black Swan, could be seen as a companion piece of sorts to The Wrestler. Both films center on individuals whose single-minded pursuit of their professions could be termed noble, maddening, and ultimately tragic. Where The Wrestler starred a 230 lb rock of a man, however, Black Swan gives us someone much different, and ultimately even more distressing; that would be the innocent and naive Nina, played with surprising fearlessness by Natalie Portman.<br /><br />Nina is a ballerina, one of a bevy of dancers in a New York City company lorded over by the brilliantly egocentric director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel in a riveting performance). The next ballet is to be Swan Lake and Nina is picked to be the company's next prima ballerina. Thomas knows that Nina has the technical skill needed to portray the White Swan, but openly questions whether she possesses the sexuality and passion to master the role of the Black Swan. We follow Nina as she prepares for the role, navigating her unstable mother (a disturbingly brilliant Barbara Hershey) and a new arrival to the company (the lively Mila Kunis), a fellow ballerina whose raw sexuality and unbridled passion pose a direct threat to Nina's ascendancy. All of this builds to a head in the film's final 40 minutes, which stands as one of the most intense movie finales in recent memory. To say any more about the film's plot would be a great disservice; suffice to say that it's doubtful you will ever look at clipping fingernails the same way again.<br /><br />Aronofsky has long been known as a director whose principals display a madness of some sort, whether it be the heroin addicts of Requiem for a Dream or the mathematician of Pi. As Portman's Nina descends down these same narrow steps, so too does the film itself. Over 300 effects shots were employed in Black Swan, often to harrowing effect. The result is a surreal and dark world in which both Nina and the audience are never quite sure what is real and what is illusory. Featuring absolutely breathtaking cinematography by Matthew Libatique, the film is a visual treat the likes of which we haven't seen in theaters all year. The overarching story structure of the film is admittedly pretty conventional, however Aronofsky's committed direction and a bevy of knockout performances combine to elevate the material to near-classic status.<br /><br />Portman has never been better and the ferocity with which she tackles the role is stunning. The power of her performance ensures that her tiny frame looms large over the entirety of the film; indeed, she appears in every scene. It is a demanding and difficult role and Portman knocks it out of the park; anything less than the Best Actress statue would be a crime. Not to be outdone, both Cassel and Hershey deliver fantastic performances, and the sense of unease that all three actors contribute to the proceedings cannot be overstated. Kunis also acquits herself well, although her role is perhaps the most one-dimensional of the film.<br /><br />I'm aware that many people (mostly males) will discount Black Swan due to the ballet setting. This would be a mistake, as they will be missing a brilliant, twisted journey into the world of competitive ballet, replete with sex, violence, and disturbing imagery galore. This is one of the best movies of the year. 5 out of 5 stars.d dark world in which both Nina and the audience are never quite sure what is real and what is illusory.

B003Q6D25U|4.0|This movie continues to bring the thrills as things go bump in the night. I really like that unlike most sequels, this one actually involves the characters and circumstances from the first movie. Although it was not perfectly integrated it did work out well. PA 2 is definitely more of a pop and flash type of scary movie where more things kinda jump and bang where the first one was a little slower and creepy. I would recommend that you do watch the first one before buying this one although you don't have to to enjoy or understand this one it does help if you know who the characters are. Going with the blu ray instead of dvd was a very good decision as the sound on a home theater system is fantastic and will make you jump out of your pants. The only reason this didn't get five stars is because I'm very picky and think that the story line in the first one was a little better and the camera on this one isn't a hand held, instead a home security system and instead of watching the one camera the screen cycles through all the different rooms before it shows you the action which can be sort of annoying but I would definitely buy this threes times again.
B002ZG981E|5.0|The power of an idea. Just as Christopher Nolan's latest epic centers around this concept, so too does this review. Inception is a completely new and original idea - no small feat in a Hollywood overflowing with sequels, reboots, and retreads. Over the past fifteen years, Nolan has proven himself to be a fine director blessed with the ability to craft epic thrillers with no shortage of intelligence, style, and technical virtuosity. Much was made over 2008's The Dark Knight and rightly so, but with Inception, Nolan has upped the ante in nearly every regard. This review will be extremely light on plot details as I firmly believe one should go into the theater with as little knowledge as possible - the experience of discovery is so great, that to take that away, even just a small amount, would be a cinematic travesty. I, for one, won't be the reviewer to do it. So if you must know all about the events that fill Inception's 2.5 hour run time, look elsewhere.<br /><br />There is so much that I could mention here that it's difficult to know where to start: the technical wizardry on display in nearly every frame, Hans Zimmer's bombastic score, and the murderer's row of acting talent all merit their own discussion. However, I must start by describing, in broad strokes only, the concept of Inception and how this complicated film springs forth from such a universal act - the act of dreaming. This is one of Nolan's many masterstrokes throughout the film. By creating a world in which perhaps 80% of what we see takes place in various dreamworlds, Nolan has captured the imagination of everyone. This is not The Matrix or eXistenZ, there is no computer knowledge or enthusiasm required; everyone dreams, and therefore every single member of the audience is able to live out various scenes of the film, because we know many of these rules. Do you ever remember the beginning of a dream? No. All of a sudden you are right in the middle of it. And how often do you wake up right as the killer is closing in or the bullets begin to tear through your chest? These are basic concepts ripped from the dreams of all the people in the world and then woven into a narrative so deep and complex that it makes The Prestige (Nolan's other masterpiece) seem as complicated as a Care Bears episode.<br /><br />So yes, Inception is a complex film, but that doesn't mean that's it's inaccessible or overly complicated. Far from it, in fact. Those who simply wish to see a glossy heist movie will not be disappointed, just as those in search of something far deeper will leave the theater happily shaking their heads at the sheer enormity and ambition of Christopher Nolan's vision. This is the ultimate thinking man's blockbuster. It is filled to the brim with magnificent action set-pieces including a zero-gravity fight in a hallway and an assault on a snow-covered hospital fortress, both of which must be seen to be believed. The academy might as well send the best special effects and art direction statues right over to the Warner Brothers lot, as both categories should be a lock after the insane display put on by Nolan and his talented crew. It's an enormous task to translate dreams to the big screen, but Inception passes every test with flying colors. This is a beautiful movie, just as The Prestige and both Batman films before it.<br /><br />I also must mention Hans Zimmer's score. Rumor has it that Nolan would not permit Zimmer to see the film as he wrote the score, and this only enhances the impact of Zimmer's deep and booming music. Not since Up and The Dark Knight, have I been this impacted by a film score. The music adds the perfect amount of grandiosity and emotion to the proceedings. Nowhere is this more apparent than the film's climax, a gut-wrenching finale that assaults the senses on every conceivable level.<br /><br />Finally, I must mention the terrific ensemble cast of Inception. Utilizing many actors he has worked with before, Christopher Nolan has brought togetherwhat is arguable the greatest cast in years and there is not a dud in the bunch. Leonardo Dicaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Marion Cotillard, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine, and the list goes on. It's an astonishing collection of talent, each of whom is utilized perfectly. There is no filler here; no characters written simply to take up space. Everyone has a part to play and the actors fill these roles perfectly. Dicaprio once again proves that there is no one better working in Hollywood today. He has come a long way since his Titanic days, and just as in Shutter Island, he commands the screen with such vigor and intelligence that it's impossible not to identify with the guy.<br /><br />Watanabe and Murphy, both villains in Nolan's Batman Begins again prove that they can absolutely command the screen whenever they want. Watanabe is an absolute marvel here, the guy's gaze could back down a pack of hungry wolves, I swear. Ellen Page continues to move away from her Juno persona and into young-Jodie Foster-territory and Marion Cotillard nails one of the most difficult roles in the film, portraying a figure both sympathetic and terrifying without seeming to break a sweat. Caine's role is not much more than a cameo, but damn he's good. I really don't know what else to say about Michael Caine, he just adds such gravitas to any film he lends his name to.<br /><br />That being said, in my mind this movie really belongs to two actors: Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy. Both are young up-and-comers in the film world, and I'll be damned if this movie doesn't launch both to stardom. JGL has come a long way since his 3rd Rock from the Sun days, exhibiting the confidence and charm of a young Brad Pitt with the range to match. His zero-g hallway fight is a sight to behold and throughout the film, Gordon-Levitt exhibits a cool factor that would be unmatched ... if it weren't for Tom Hardy. Previously confined largely to British cinema and thus unseen and unappreciated in the states, Hardy exploded onto the scene with last year's Bronson and continues his ascent with a wise-cracking bad-ass role which he tears into with unabashed enthusiasm. Hardy was a crowd favorite at the screening I attended and I dare you to feel any different. The man simply oozes charisma and he possesses the physicality necessary for any role. Indeed, he will next be seen in the remake of The Road Warrior, and as much as I detest remakes, this one will be on my radar for one simple reason: Tom Hardy.<br /><br />If you haven't figured it out by now, let me spell it out for you. I love this movie. As I left the theater I was struck by a sensation very rare for the jaded would-be film critic: pure and genuine excitement. I couldn't get Inception out of my head all night long and when I woke up the next morning, it was the first thing to enter my mind. I simply can not give any greater recommendation than that.

0316098337|4.0|Jack is the 5-year old narrator of this captivating novel.  This was my first exposure to the writing of Emma Donoghue, but based on just this novel she is a master of character development. She walks us through a fictional, but scarily realistic tale of a woman who has been kidnapped and sexually tortured for seven years and, as a result of the rape, births Jack. Donoghue allows us entry into the minds of many woman who like `Ma' are kidnapped off the street and how they deal with the struggle of being cut off completely from society and everyone they love. The imaginary world she constructs to prevent her son from suffering the same evils that plague her on a constant basis is nothing less than magical! The turning point in the book came almost from left field which I found to be very refreshing considering the predictability with the plots of novels as of late.    I found a huge disconnect between the believability in the first half of the novel to the second half. I found that the second half of the novel lost this realistic feeling that was so prevalent in the first half. I found that while Jack's character transitioned in a realistic fashion, Ma's character is a different story. She underwent such a transformation that it didn't seem like I was reading the same woman's story. It didn't bother me enough to want to put down the novel; however, I did find this disconnect somewhat irksome.    I have contradicting feelings about this novel. As a lover of literature and a mother, I loved this novel! It is an amazing story about the struggle of a woman who does her best to raise a child in a 11x11 garage shed and the struggles that re-entry into society raise. The novel is a page turner and hard to put down once you form a bond with the characters and invest yourself into the story; however, as a pre-service English teacher, this book would be completely useless. Though I do believe that the story would captivate students' minds, there is very little material that could be pulled from the book for any meaningful lesson other than plot discussion.  Also, the situations that arise from the plot of the story  are way too controversial for a classroom. The way I see it, with all of the new works of literature that could be incorporated into a lesson plan that have so much more to offer in terms of teachable content, this book is not worth wasted class time.

B003XRZZFM|3.0|This is definitely not the best album they have ever Dimmu Borgir released. Their previous works are much better. This album is a little monotonous (most black metal albums are - but Dimmu Borgir is an exception to the rule). I don't like also the fact that in most tracks there are some speakers to provide some kind of atmosphere but the result is not good. I also don't like this production , and Dimmu Borgir in their previous 4 albums have an amazing production. The songs overall are not bad but they are also not good that the reason i rate this album with 3 stars -> just ok

B000FBJAOG|5.0|this book is worth every cent, it explains everything you need to know about zombies from their anatomy to recorded attacks. It explains various weapons that are bad and good for killing zombies, how to rebuild after an apocalypse and even the stages in time after getting bit by a zombie until your transformation into the ranks of the undead. This is probably my favorate book out of all of them and it will probably always be. I hope you get a chance to download this book because I know you will love it and if you dont you will still love it anyway.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Really loved the book, plot, characters, etc and am looking forward to reading the rest of the All Souls trilogy. Well worth reading, now I plan to buy the hard copy as well for my library. It's a story that is beautifully paced and plotted. I think the author is immensely talented. The story starts slowly and blossoms into a rich and colorful tale. Can't wait for the next one!
0385737955|2.0|This was recommended to me as someone who like \\"The Hunger Games\\" but I have no idea WHY this would be recommended for someone who likes that series. What I loved about HG was the connection I felt to the main character and the completely out of this world situation she experienced. In Maze Runner, there is also an out of this world situation (that's probably where the recommendation came from) but it didn't draw me in. Neither did the main character. I found myself not really caring what happened to Thomas or anyone else in the Glade. The main issues, for me,    1. The 'slang'. I realize this is part of a series, and maybe this slang will play a role in it (if it does, then I retract this statement). As it stands in this book, it just annoyed me because it played no role in this book or in the plot.   2. The predictability. SPOILERS AHEAD. I knew Chuck would sacrifice himself from the moment we were introduced to him. I knew Thomas had a role in the Maze's design from the first chapter. And I knew the way out of the maze involved the Cliff as soon as Thomas saw it. There were some suprises to his book (that's where the 2 stars come from) but not enough.  3. The Grievors. I couldn't really picture them and they didn't scare me. I kept picturing giant slugs with wheels and a claw with a needle. It gave me a cartoon-ish feeling.    There are positives to this story...it is a fast read and I loved Frypan. And you get a conclusion to the story despite the fact that it's a series.     The best way for me to review this book is to say that I generally don't mind series, and if I read the first in a series I will, 99% of the time, read the rest of it because I feel like I started it, I might as well finish it. But I won't read the next in this series. I didn't even care to know what happened after the maze project was over. For me, that's very telling of how uncompelling this book is.
030746363X|3.0|Remember that old saying that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is? The 4-Hour body promises to show you:    ·        How to lose 20 pounds in 30 days without exercising;    ·        How to increase fat-loss 300% with a few bags of ice;    ·        How to sleep 2 hours per day and feel fully rested;    ·        How the author gained 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days, without steroids, and in 4 hours of total gym time;    ·        How to go from running 5 kilometers to 50 kilometers in 12 weeks    ·        How to reverse \\"permanent\\" injuries;    ·        How to add 150+ pound to your lifts in 6 months;    ·        How to pay for a beach vacation with one hospital visit;    ·        How to hold your breath longer than Houdini; and much more.    I'd like to tell you that all the promises are true and that the author discovered some new information in each of these areas that reveals all these secrets. But I'd be lying. The truth is that most of the above examples are wildly overstated, greatly exaggerated, impractical, ill-advised or simply physically dangerous.    Let's go over just a few examples.    In the chapter on how to lose 20 pounds in 30 days without exercising, Ferriss says that it's possible to do so by \\"optimizing any of three factors: exercise, diet, or a drug/supplement regime.\\" He then goes on to note that in 2007 he went from 180 pounds to 165 pounds in six weeks.    But how is losing 15 pounds in six weeks the same thing as losing 20 pounds in 30 days, you might ask? Ferriss explains that he added about 10 pounds of muscle during this time so that he really lost about 25 pounds.  Two questions immediately come to mind. One, how do you know you gained 10 pounds of muscle during this six weeks? Two, you promised to show folks how to lose 20 pounds in six weeks without exercising - so how did you gain 10 pounds of muscle if you weren't exercising?    Ferriss claims he lost the weight by doing what he calls the Slow-Carb Diet:    1.Avoid \\"white\\" carbohydrates. He writes that you should avoid any carbohydrate that is or can be white \\"except for within 30 minutes of finishing a resistance training workout\\" as described in other chapters. (Workout sure sounds like exercise to me - don't you think?) So no bread, rice, cereal, potatoes, pasta, tortillas, and fried food with breading.    2.      Eat the same few meals over and over again. Basically, eggs, chicken, beef, fish and pork for proteins. Legumes include lentils, black beans, pinto beans, red beans and soybeans. For vegetables, choose spinach, asparagus, peas, broccoli, green beans, cauliflower, and sauerkraut.    3.      Don't drink calories. No milk, soft drinks, white wine, beer, or fruit juice.    4.      Don't eat fruit. Except for tomatoes and avocadoes (in moderation), don't eat any fruit.    5.      Take one day off each week. Eat whatever you want one day a week. Ferris has specific instructions on how to minimize weight gain and insulin release on your binge day.    He also recommends supplements to increase insulin sensitivity: PAGG, which is 4 different supplements (Policosanol, Alpha-Lipoic Acid, Green Tea Extract and Garlic), taken in a combination at particular doses. These supplements are taken six days a week, with one day off each week and one week off each two months. Ferriss also recommends that you do air squats, wall presses, and chest pulls with an elastic band a few minutes before you eat and 90 minutes afterwards on your binge day (again, what ever happened to that \\"without exercising\\" claim?). He says that the diet causes you to lose excess water and recommends that you take additional supplements: potassium, magnesium, and calcium.    If this seems all a little daunting that's because, well, it is. The hype is: lose 20 pounds in 30 days without exercising. The advice: give up all bread, pasta, rice, cereal, potatoes and fried foods with breading. Don't eat fruit, drink beer, or have fruit juice. Eat the same fewmeals over and over and over and over.    Let's turn to something else Ferriss promises: how to pay for a beach vacation with one hospital visit. In reading this chapter, Ferriss explains how he went to Nicaragua for two and a half weeks and spent about $2400 on travel expenses, housing, auto rental and food. So how does a hospital visit pay for his vacation?    Ferriss explained that he went to a hospital and had seven MRIs taken at a negotiated price of $400 each. He estimates that if he had to pay for those in the U.S. that they would have cost approximately $750 each so he \\"saved\\" $2450. He also estimates that he saved $640 on comprehensive blood and urine testing. This resulted, according to Ferriss, is a total cost savings of over $3000 which more than paid for his trip.    Does this make any sense? Ferriss claims it does because he uses the seven MRI for testing and prevention. But I question that assumption. First, who in their right mind needs seven MRIs? I'm over 50 and I haven't had seven MRIs in my lifetime. Second, I have health insurance and the few MRI's I've had didn't cost me $750 - something substantially less. Third, MRI's taken while you're healthy might not be beneficial to your doctor if you're injured. If I injure my knee running and my doctor wants an MRI, one taken three months ago in Nicaragua isn't going to be any good. Fourth, how do you judge the quality of the medical care you'll get in another country?    Again, the hype is much better than the advice.    What about the claim to sleep 2 hours per day and feel fully rested? It called polyphasic sleep and sounds great until you realize that it requires that you get your 2 hours sleep by taking 20-minute naps every 4 hours. Ferriss cautions that you can't oversleep and can't skip naps or you'll be a zombie.    Come on. Really? Who can handle this sleep schedule? And even if you can adjust to it after a few weeks, how practical is it and how long can your body endure it? And how healthy isit? The idea is that most folks only get a couple of hours each night of deep REM sleep, but isn't there also some benefit to the other phases of sleep?    I could go on and on in analyzing each of the claims in this book but I don't want to leave the impression that the advice was completely worthless.    It wasn't.    The Slow Carb Diet is similar to the paleo diet, or the Atkins diet. As such, it has some health benefits - with some tweaking. Taking a day off each week in your diet has been proposed by others (can you say Body for Life?). Many of the exercises proposed by Ferriss are valuable. He had some common sense rules about getting a good night's sleep that were valuable. His ideas on running with proper form (Pose method) are a Reader's Digest version of the training advice in Born to Run.    This is a big book in many sections. For those new to fitness, you should take all the claims with a grain of salt and proceed slowly. I wouldn't, for example, expect to go from running 5K to 50K in 12 weeks without injury. Ferriss has a couple of chapters where he consults with Brian MacKenzie (a former tri-athlete) to come up with a training plan.    Ferriss indicates in the book that he followed the plan. Did it work for him? He ends the chapter by saying that there wasn't enough time to update the chapter before going to press but that the outcome is on his blog. My book is a 4th printing and Amazon says the book was first published on December 14, 2010. But the link on the author's blog detailing how he did in his 50K run is suspiciously missing with a note that it's \\"coming soon.\\"    Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
1449382673|5.0|I've been worrying a bit about pigeonholed into the JEE slot, so I bought this to get a bit of experience to leverage into Jython, and thereby keep my professional career alive until I can start sucking the life out of younger social security contributors.    What?  Oh, right, internal monologue.    As to the book, the chapters build, there are lots of good examples, and there's an especial emphasis on how to do things \\"The Python Way\\", as opposed to, oh, coding up brute force iterative algorithms.  You really can't ask any more from a book.  In fact, I'd like to audit one of the author's classes - it's that well done.    I like this book very much.  I think it's very well done.      Oh, the rest of y'all Americans, learn about Fiach McHugh O'Byrne.  And Irish rebel songs.  It's almost 3/17, for God's sake.
1591841666|1.0|Another ' who moved my cheese'. The author has 3 or 4 lines and keeps repeating them all along the book.  Dip, quit, average, number 1, best in the world, dead end; these few words constitute half his vocabulary.     Don't waste your money or time on this book. Your mom probably has better insights about success than what is offered in this book.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|We ordered this for our Baby Jogger Summit XC stroller and love the storage.  It is a great, cost efficient alternative to the Baby Jogger Universal console.      It holds two water bottles with an area in the middle for a sippy cup, keys, phone, etc.  The only catch is that you have to watch it when you fold up the stroller or everything will fall out.     Very glad we ordered this and highly recommend it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I discovered this album after reading that the song `Paranoid Android' is featured in the anime `Ergo Proxy', so I finally decided to borrow the album from my local library. Since then, I've listened to it several times, and I've been trying to understand the concept of the album. Sometimes, I played the album more than once a day (which I don't often do). Though I'm sure there is a theme to the music (whether it's cultural or political), a thought hit me: \\"FORGET ABOUT THE CONCEPT. THIS RECORD SOUNDS AWESOME.\\" From the beginning to the end, I was drawn in by the first two songs `Airbag' and `Paranoid Android.' Every song seemed to flow-in (in a good way) through my ears. Most of the songs give very up-lifting feelings through them. I've listened to the album almost everyday since I borrowed from library. After maybe the 100th time I listened to it, another thought hit me: \\"BUY THE ALBUM ALREADY.\\" I just recently became a fan of Radiohead, so I'll definitely look into more of their albums. In my opinion, the best song on this album is............ (Sigh) I can't say. With this album, it's hard to have just one or two, or even three favorites. I would've thought the song \\"Paranoid Android\\" would be my favorite until I listened to the whole album.
0061245097|3.0|I was going to re-read this book until I read that book 3 is a little disappointing if you are still on a high from this one.  So I am going to go straight to the next one.  But man...did I want to flip back to certain chapters!<br /><br />I wasn't feeling book 1 and couldn't stand how innocent and dumb (IMHO) Cat was but the character eventually grew on me.  By the end I couldn't wait to read this one and the inevitable reunion between Cat and Bones.  I did really like this book although it wasn't perfect.  I felt as if Bones is slowly becoming a doormat and existing simple to protect Cat.  At least in Book 1, he had a mission.  The ending seemed slapped together for me but I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt since the saga between Cat and her Father continues.<br /><br />The sex scenes were some of the best I have read, although I missed some the emotional connection between Cat and Bones that occurred in the previous chapter.  Okay...I'll admit it...perhaps this book is getting 3 stars because I was completely hot and bothered over one sex scene in particular.  I still wish the story flowed better, focused on the love, gave Bones more of a purpose and made Cat just a tad bit less annoying.  I'm hanging in there and holding out hope for more depth and character development.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I watched this movie for a elective class at school and all of my class loved this movie, most of us had never seen a \\"Hitchcock\\" before and we were on the edge of our seat most of the time. Highly recomended along with \\"The Birds\\", \\"Psycho\\", \\"North by Northwest\\", and \\"Vertigo.\\"
B002WCLG48|2.0|Okay. Let me explain for anyone raged at my title. First off. I like anime, there is some good stuff out there and I'll be one of the first to let ya know the good titles. Second off, I am a HUGE Halo fan. I have the O in Halo tattoo`d on my wrist, I hope that says enough about my love for Halo. This DVD was CRAP. It's all anime, I thought it was just drawn by Japanese or done in an Eastern style, no. The whole thing is written, drawn, produced and everything else in Japan. The one thing that draws me to Halo when you remove the story and the fun factor, is the fact that Americans came up with it. This DVD crap`s all over that. The whole thing is basically an anime revolving around the Halo Universe and really just does not fit. The first two parts, Origin I and II I liked, after that none of them could keep my attention. It was sooo ridiculous. Covenant in ancient Japanese huts and clothing? A Spartan who acts like Kikuchiyo from Samurai 7? It goes on and on. If you like anime and don't care about the Halo lore, you`ll love it, it's straight Japanese anime, but if you're like me and expect a good cartoon with a lot of Spartan butt-kicking, forget it, it's full of lovey-dovey, out of Halo-norm junk. Just steal this one for the box-art. Lastly, the only reason I gave this 2 stars was because I did like the aforementioned parts.
B004DWKOE8|5.0|What If is the brilliant new album from the original Mr Big lineup that ticks all the essential boxes including virtuoso performances, memorable songs, and a really good vibe and energy from the band. The sound of the album is very live and Eric Martin's vocals are still as strong as ever. Paul Gilbert, Billy Sheehan, and Pat Torpey are still monster players and they all get to shine throughout these songs. Highlights include the amazing opener \\"Undertow\\", the Van Halen inspired rock of \\"American Beauty\\", the intense musical shred of \\"Still Ain't Enough For Me\\", the odd meter groove of \\"Once Upon A Time\\", the high quality ballad \\"All The Way Up\\", the massive chorus of \\"Around The World\\", and the party vibe of \\"I Get The Feeling\\". The deluxe edition includes a bonus DVD that contains a 20 minute behind the scenes look at the making of the album and two cool film clips with nice dance moves from Eric on \\"Undertow\\"! The packaging is really good with lots of cool photos and a nice lyric booklet. Mr Big is a supergroup worthy of the title and What If is a brilliant return from one of the best bands of the past 20 years.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This might be smaller than you think. It's about 15% smaller than regular Jansports backpack. So if you are tall and big, it kinda look funny. But, the storage area is large enough to carry all the accessories. The velcroed dividers are completely customizable; you can put them anywhere you want and of course you can remove them if you want. The bag itself is pretty light which is obvious because it's relatively small and have thick enough paddings all around. I think you can throw it with your lenses and bodies in it and they are still safe (but don't).    Overall, it does what it's meant to do.
0060751967|3.0|This book was ok. Defineetly on the lower scale of writing. I liked the story, but it was not very well written. If I had played a drinking game based on how many times Roman say \\"God's blood\\" I would be dead from alcohol poisoning
B004AHNIGM|4.0|Finally, this incredible fusion of sounds of rock, country and blues are back for our enjoyment. If you were one of those who loved this sound years ago or new to the sound it is inspiring - rocking with soul!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|No spoilers here.<br /><br />This is an excellent show, and I am anxiously waiting for the next season.  This is so much more than Man vs. Zombie.  It is the story of survival of Man vs. any disaster.  In this case it is zombies, but it could be disease, virus, war, whatever, but it ultimately is man trying to survive in a massive world breakdown.<br /><br />I thought each episode was well thought out, and flowed very well.  It's only six episodes -- more like a miniseries in that the story was continuously played with the only gap being when the characters broke for sleep.  The only real complaint I had is that I didn't really connect with some characters, but only because I didn't think the acting was that good in those cases.  I thought the main leads were excellent and perfectly cast, especially Andrew Lincoln, John Bernthal (both new to me) and of course, Jeffrey DeMunn who always fits every role he plays.  Andrew Lincoln is incredibly believable in this role.<br /><br />Frank Darabont is all over this series.  I think the graphic books that this series is based on are really good, but they do  seem like Man vs. Zombies.  Darabont fleshed out the books (and changed much) but I think for the best.<br /><br />I haven't watched all the extras, but the set is loaded and plan to go through each.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|Great sound quality, but the wire that goes from playstation to head phones always pulls out of head set, they need to develope something better. I've sent the 1st head phones back, and know seecond one is doing the same thing the volume controller is to heavy- I know they have clip for it but he clip is bulky and gets in way better design would be the answer -sound quality is great!
B000UX6THK|5.0|Yes, I am one of those Twin Peaks Geeks.  I loved this series and have been waiting for years for this collection.  I enjoyed the \\"log lady\\" intros.  Brings back so many memories.
0634022296|5.0|I am not really an aspiring songwriter, but I do like to write songs from time to time.  Somebody once told me to look at the structure of Beatles songs to get a better grasp of how good songs are put together, so I got this book just for that reason.  really gave me an appreciation for this act and their ability to write great songs!    I think this would be good for beginning (and up) guitar players too.  Will get you up and playing songs very quickly, so you'll have fun while developing your playing.
075640407X|5.0|For fun, I just read through about 20 of the \\"1 Star\\" reviews posted here. Like so many of them state, \\"I can't believe we read the same book.\\" It saddens me that 38 of the 800 or so reviewers of this book were so infuriated by their lack of enjoyment of it that they felt the need to warn others off of it.     I wanted to comment on a couple themes that recurred.     Several of the 1 Star people suggested that Mr. Rothfuss gathered 600 or so of his closest friends and family and coerced them into placing great reviews on the site. Really? It couldn't just be that maybe you didn't pick up on his writing style? That maybe the way he turned a phrase wasn't the way you wanted to see it written? Are these people living in a fantasy realm themselves? It's just a silly notion.     Another complaint was that Kvothe was too much larger than life, too good at everything he tried? So what?!? Several of these people brought up Robert Jordan as a better example of Epic Fantasy. I had to smack my head. Rand Al'Thor picked up a flute, a sword and the ability to use the \\"One Power\\" and became master of all three and king of the known world over the course of two years (yes it was 20 years worth of books, but the 13 or so books tell the tale of a course of time that only spans a couple years). The fact is, Kvothe is not going through life without encountering hardship or enduring hard knocks, he encounters challenges and faces them.     The fact is, the book concept itself and the style of phrasing is new and interesting. There are lulls and imperfections, but there are enough points of brilliance that they are forgiven and even appreciated as quiet moments between thunderheads. Do yourself a favor, go in and read the first chapter at the bookstore. If you're not hooked, put it down and walk away, nothing lost. Otherwise, enjoy.

B0002TKFRM|5.0|This recording offers some of the most exciting music you will find on any disc anywhere; if you have any interest in exciting music performed with a maximum of enthusiastic abandon then this is one you should not miss.<br /><br />I want to consider two aspects of this recording, the music and the engineering.<br /><br />First the music<br /><br />One of the biggest features on this disc is a first class recording of \\"A Night On Bald Mountain\\" with the original Mussorgsky orchestration. It is more likely you have heard the arrangement of this work by Rimsky-Korsakov as his calmed down version is more frequently performed. This selection alone is worth the price of admission if you enjoy wild, dramatic Russian music; it doesn't get much better than this.<br /><br />I have never heard better sounding recordings of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra than the ones on this disc; the orchestra performs the music with fresh drama that brings it to life. If you have any notion that these performances are just more of the same, put that thought out of your mind; they bring a life and sparkle to the music that is sadly absent on most other recordings I've heard.<br /><br />Although I had heard of Fritz Reiner for almost all of my adult life I had no idea what a gifted interpreter of music he really was and how much he truly deserved his reputation. His conducting of these performances presents the music in a way that opens up new horizons; I felt as if I'd not really heard them before, this was the way they were meant to be played.<br /><br />I already have most of these works by several different conductors and orchestras and had a few reservations about getting yet another rendition; fortunately I overcame those reservations and am delighted that I did.<br /><br />There is a dramatic presence to these recordings that places the listener right on stage with the conductor; I do not know how the microphones were placed but the results makes one feel right on stage there with the orchestra. The sound is sumptuous with sparkling cymbals, resonate bass drums and a smooth string sound that is free of any harshness.<br /><br />Reiner believes in keeping things moving so none of the works drag; the tempi are brisk and bright.<br /><br />Now the engineering<br /><br />My hat is off to the RCA engineers that had the vision to record these so beautifully in three-channel sound; the results in SACD are fantastic. The sound stage is wide and very smooth. It's easy to locate the instruments positions in the orchestra. The dynamic range leaves nothing to be desired. The truth is I cannot find fault with any aspect of this recording concerning music performance, interpretation, or engineering! It is saddening to consider that some of the newest DTS-HD Master Audio recordings don't measure up to the musicality and beauty of this recording.<br /><br />My hat is also off to the engineers and producers who remastered these recordings and transferred them to the SACD format. It is interesting that the full implementation of the early vision had to wait for technology to catch up.<br /><br />I've been ordering a bunch of these \\"Living Stereo\\" recordings and the more I hear the more I go back and order the ones I don't have yet.
