B0000542D2|5.0|This DVD is the best reproduction of the movie experience i have seen. The picture quality is excellent, the dialog is clear. Honestly my memory of the sound of the tunes isn't all that great from the original when I saw it in the theaters. The excitement of seeing this movie at the theater was such that any sound at all would have been acceptable. The sound of the tunes on the DVD version is all there, though I would have preferred real stereo or 5.1 surround. The only tune that seems to have that is in the \\"live performance\\" scene where you hear the girls screaming in the rear channels. This will have to do until they remix the entire movie...which i am sure they will. It is now in  the wide screen format with some chop off at the top and bottom...but who cares? It wasn't obvious enough to make me aware of it, and frankly I like everything in widescreen anyway. This DVD took me back to that time in the sixties...and thats what i was looking for. Well done.

B002JM1VJG|4.0|Madonna is definitely the \\"Queen of Pop Music\\" and a celebration is in order. Madonna has truly revolutionized the music industry -- and deserves more credit for. I'm disappointed to a certain extent that her former record company, Warner Bros., would not put together a respectable collection. Don't get me wrong -- the songs and music videos selected are awesome; -- but, some great videos have been omitted. The \\"Bad Girl\\" video for example; was one of the many (hard-to-believe)omissions. This mini-movie music video is one of Madonna's greatest videos of all time (great cinematography and directed by acclaim David Fincher). Nonetheless, 'Celebration' is a celebration indeed! Celebrating the great and infectious music of one of the most influential artist of the modern era! I hope next time they will honor Madonna with an anthology! Long live the Queen of Pop...
1601251505|5.0|Bless Pazio for having the good sense to see 3.5 as my entire gaming group did, a great product that just needed a tune up.  This book did just that taking the great 3.5 system and revising it to be more balanced.  If you are a gamer and hesitant about switching over to 4th edition, which by the way is a joke (4th ed = pen & Paper World of Warcraft) then pathfinder is the product for you!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I caught this on TV last night and just loved it. I missed a little of the beginning, so I can't wait to watch the whole movie now that I've ordered the DVD.  Simply put, this film is just ... sweet. I love nothing better than seeing innocent love well depicted. Of course, it does compress some episodes of Beatrix Potter's life, but it does so brilliantly -- and anyway, who cares? This film will not disappoint anyone who appreciates the beauty of true love.
1594488916|4.0|I wasn't sure I would like this book at first for a couple reasons.  First, I don't normally read nonfiction.  Second, it read kind of like a paper for school at first.  But, it didn't take me long to get wrapped up in the world of rare books and book theft.<br />  I've never given much thought to rare books.  Sure, I collect books but that's about it.  I was completely amazed at some of the books and the stores/dealers that carry them in this story.  In fact I might make a trip to Salt Lake City to see Ken Sanders store sometime in the future (it's only 2 1/2 hours from me so why not!).  It actually made me want to find out more information on rare book (not that I plan on collecting lol!)<br />  I've also never thought about book theft.  I know about the destruction of books throughout history.  But, people actually going out of their way to steal one...wow.  I was enthralled with how Gilkey would research out a book and then go about adding it to his \\"collection\\".  I was even more amazed at how he never felt remorse or that what he was doing was wrong.  If anything he almost felt it was the dealers fault for putting his beloved books out of reach.<br />  The only thing that bothered me was at times I wasn't sure whoose side the author was on.  She does mention taking to lawyers about legal responsibilty in reporting Gilkey, but I never felt like it really bothered her.  And I'm pretty sure she should have reported when he admited he was violating his parole.<br />  Overall, it was an interesting and enlightening read!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|In late 80s' I moved to US and bought all The Beatles' CDs.   Somehow they sounded bit dull, and I thought to myself, I've out grown The Beatles. Apparently not, these new recordings took me right back where I was.  I highly recommend it.
0385504225|3.0|Let's start this way:  Dan Brown's books make great movies. Why? Because the films don't have time for his \\"mystic-tristic-bulls--t,\\" -- they can get down to the heart of his thrillers.<br /><br />I've been dealing with esoterica, especially the religious kind for the last 40 years of my life, ever since I started my journey away from Catholicism.  Brown's books are generally convolutlated paths as he picks and chooses between established history and fact and the pseudo-history and commonly held falacies which guide people away from reality, to a degree that sometimes confuses people who understand which is which. (Warning:  If you read a book that promises to tell the truth about a mystery, count the exclamation points.  If there is more than one in the first 20 pages, put it down and never come back unless you're reading it for a giggle.)<br /><br />The Lost Symbol falls into this category.  Brown has taken historic and \\"occult\\" information and twisted them into a mishmash to support his plot, even if there is no real sense in the ideas. This is a boring attempt at something that he succeeded at in The DaVinci Code (although the allegations in that book include things I truly wish were true).  Poor Robert Langdon must deal with the torture of a friend, all the while trying to stop something that he has little background to help himself, since he, himself, has no access to the hidden secrets that are contained in the Masonic dogma.  &<br />While Masons do, indeed, have secrets, as Langdon contends in his lecture, they are neither occult (in the commonly held definition) nor people who are trained to lead the world:  For every Washington or Franklin, there are thousands of members who treat the Order as a form of fraternity with secret handshakes and signs, dedicated to trying to make the world a better place.  The best of them are more responsible for the creation of projects like the Shriners' Childrens' Hospitals than in plotting world domination.  This dedication to making the world better is why Masons exist, and if some of the world's greatest leaders have been members of the group, it is because of this goal rather than a craving for some magical power to employ it attain their greatness.<br /><br />Go rent the DaVinci Code or Angels & Demons and you'll have a better time and won't waste the many hours it takes to read this thing.<br /><br />Read it if there's nothing entertaining on TV or because you really have nothing else to do, but don't take it seriously.  On second thought, wait until the movie comes out -- at least then you can enjoy a shorter, more coherent version.rld better is why Masons exist, and if some of the world's greatest leaders have been members of the group, it is because of this goal rather than a craving for some magical power to employ it attain their greatness.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Going through the Mono Box all was fine... until I got to Help! and Rubber Soul.    Instead of 14 tracks, both discs have TWENTY EIGHT.  The mono album is followed by the album again, in STEREO.    I've checked Revolver and Pepper and they have the correct 14 and 13 tracks.    But it gets even stranger.  On Rubber Soul the biggest single difference between mono and stereo mixes is the false start at the beginning of the stereo mix of \\"I'm Looking Through You.\\"    Like I would expect, the mono track doesn't have it.  But neither does the stereo version (which is definitely in stereo).    I don't have the remastered stereo Rubber Soul so I can't say for sure the false start is still there or not.    Has anyone else noticed any mention of this anywhere?
B001TH28EO|5.0|I purchased this DG Complete Brahms for my wife. She could not be more pleased. The recordings are superb and the price is amazing. This is a worthwhile addition to the music library of any serious classical music fan.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|ok....being a megadeth fan i had to get this album on release day. no questions asked. now, i have been burned before by this policy (anyone remember 'risk'?)  well suffice it to say that after the last few albums, getting this one on day one was a no-brainer.  both 'the system has failed' and 'united abominations' were stellar albums and both showed megadaves push toward a more heavy and thrashy sound. much like old and classic megadeth. he seemed to put the days of 'risk' and 'twnah' behind him.  ENDGAME takes this to a whole new level. and what a wonderful revelation it is!!!!!    my god this album kicks major a**!!!    i'm listening to it even as i write the review.    track by track:    'dialectic chaos' - ok i have no idea what the hell the title means but damn. what a way to open an album. with an instrumental thrashfest that will get you banging immediately. pure thrashing madness!    'this day we fight' - a ture thrash masterpiece. heavy and brutal with amazing riffing. i can only imagine how this song will be live. the pit will be insane on this one. it's THAT fast and heavy. true 'deth song if there ever was one.    '44 minutes' - a song based on actual events. i've actually seen documentaries of the events that are retold in this song. it starts with a great opening guitar lick. very ominous and it presents a great atmosphere with the spoken word police chatter. very melodic chorus. rockin track overall.    '1320' - this song shows daves love of auto racing. a lot of people will compare this song to deth's older song '502' but whatever. it's a fast and heavy track that gets you moving.    'bite the hand' - the fast and chunky riffs work together to make a great song. i like this one.    'bodies' - this one is not as heavy as some of the other tracks but it's still heavy in it's own right. good song.    'endgame' - a classic megadeth song with dave spitting his political venom. all the riffs are easily recognizeable as classic megadeth riffs. will definately remind you of older 'deth. this one sounds like it could have been taken off of 'countdown' or 'youthanasia'.    'the hardest part of letting go.....sealed with a kiss' - the ballad (if you can call it that) of the album. the first part starts out slow with the second part kicking in with the heavy. the first part of the song describing the love at first sight while the second part contrasts with the revenge theme, as love goes bad. a lot of people have been slagging this song but i like it. it breaks the album up a little. some of the melody in the 2nd part of the song reminds me of nightwish.  is this song indicative of dave's possible impending divorce? decide for yourself ;p    'headcrusher' - pure thrash brutality. no other way to describe it. true old school megadeth.    'how the story ends' - a good rocking track. another that could have been taken off of 'countdown' or 'youthanasia'.    'the right to go insane' - not my favorite track on the album this one is a little bit slower but still a good track.    all in all i'd say that megadave is back in form on this one. over the last few albums we've seen the progression back to the heavier stuff. and if this is what megadeth is, now, THEN I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ALBUM!!!!  the album is tight, produced well, and kicks a**. not much more can be said about this masterpiece. it will easily rank among megadeth's best ever.    GO BUY THIS ALBUM!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!\\"

B0025KVLU6|2.0|So much good was said of this new re-mastering of the Beatles' sound, that I enthusiastically bought this record... only to discover it was much noise for less than little. The sound is firmer, which is nice, but there is so much space between each instrument that you can proudly show of your loud speakers, but the coherence of the sound has disappeared. The texture is as metallic as techno music can be, but the charm of the Beatle's sound has completely disappeared. No humour, no warmth, no pleasure, no charm. In other words the final result is even worst than the previous CD version. It is as if the engineers wanted to prove the Beatles are a pale copy of Michael Jackson's music. If you still have the LPs, hang on to them.
B001CDLATE|5.0|This film is uniquely beautiful, especially in high definition.  Its hard to describe it justly, but its almost a visual meditation - no narration or dialog, just a stream of consciousness showing scenes of nature and of mankind, both striking and beautiful.

B001P9EQH8|5.0|My portable set-up:  ipod \\"classic\\" 80 gig, Sennheiser HD595 headphones, MP3 files ranging from rock to classical.  I have in the past considered myself an audiophile, but as my ears have aged, and with an annual \\"hearing check\\" I know my upper range is about 18K Hz --barely-- and I have some drop off in the 7500-8000 Hz range --- I know my organic equipment is just not as good as the hardware I use at home or on the road.  As an educated listener, I know what distortion, low signal to noise ratios, \\"surface noise\\", and other normal defects sound like.  As someone who has been exposed to professional mixing set-ups, I can also hear bad mixing, mix-downs, mix-ups (!), and equipment/engineering/quality problems.<br /><br />Normally I use Shure E-4 earphones for listening to music on my ipod, but sometimes I want a less intrusive and wider soundspace than earphones can provide, so headphones are it.  Unfortunately, the ipod alone just cannot adequately drive the Sennheiser headphones.  What the heck, I will try this inexpensive Fiio E5 headphone amp -- even with some of the mixed reviews.<br /><br />I was a little surprised that the quality was very acceptable.  The volume boost is just right, not only for my ipod but right off my laptop also.  I suspect that those that are hearing hums or other noise from this amp may have source material problems or maybe some other output defect. For portable listening I use MP3 files and everything I listen to is at 320 kps directly from the original wav files ripped from CD.  I do prefer to listen to CD's at higher resolution but find 320 kps acceptable as a portable listen. With that, I can hear source problems either related to the original recording, mix, or transfer to digital, and listening through headphones only magnifies those problems.  For the Fiio?  I do not hear any significant humming, buzzing, distortion, or any other noise from good source material at 320 kps.  With many headphone amps being much more expensive and larger, the E5 purchased for $20 from Head-Direct (the US distributor), is pretty sweet and a keeper.purchased for $20 from Head-Direct (the US distributor), is pretty sweet and a keeper.
0316044695|5.0|Marcus Luttrell has written a book about sacrifice:  Keeping the faith, serving your country and an unsurpassed willingness to survive while still willing to die for your country and fellow soldiers.<br /><br />The book is really two stories:  The first presents the brutal challenge of becoming a SEAL and the story of the events during and after Operation Red Wing. The first half, takes you inside the training to become a SEAL.  As a stand alone book, it would have been worthy.  The second half, Operation Red Wing, almost defies description.  In June 2005 Operation Red Wing was underway on a mission to identify and eliminate Taliban leadership.  While on patrol, the 4-man SEAL Team was discovered by a goat herder and his son.  By all military rules, they knew they should have killed the pair.  But they could not.  As expected, the man told the local Taliban about the Americans and all hell broke loose, ending in the deaths of 19 Americans - the largest loss of life in Navy SEAL history.<br /><br />The Lone Survivor, Luttrell, was described like this when he was found:<br /><br />...(he) lay in the dirt. His face was shredded, his nose broken, three vertebrae cracked from tumbling down a ravine. A Taliban rocket-propelled grenade had ripped off his pants and riddled him with shrapnel.<br /><br />This book includes an emotional and graphic recollection of that brutal battle. That his survival was aided by a local Pushtun village who provided him Lokhay, protection, from the Taliban is a window into the complex political and inter-tribal relationships that dominate Afghani culture.<br /><br />In the end, we learn that becoming a SEAL involves a mental state that forces the body to follow but that these guys are not unthinking killing machines.  This dichotomy is almost impossible to understand for a civilian, but common for these elite warriors.
0312427999|5.0|An excellently written indictment of the forces of Chicago School laissez-faire capitalism and the incredible misery it causes in the pursuit of profit and power. It could probably be easily denounced as an ultra left-wing diatribe were it not so impeccably researched and masterfully woven. The dots are undeniably connected between disaster, whether natural or man-made, and the subsequent forced economic liberalization imposed by large corporations, their governments and the IMF and World Bank. These liberalizations lead to the selling off of a country's natural resources, the privatization of government industries and the removal of the people from the entire transaction, leading to general impoverishment and ever widening gaps between rich and poor. Meanwhile the ruling powers of these countries enrich themselves and even further enrich foreign multinational corporations. These changes are imposed with an iron fist of repression, terror and murder of those with the temerity stand against these outrages.    The book illustrates that these patterns have been played out again and again since the 1970's when Friedmanite neoliberal economic theory got it's first test cases in Latin America, beginning with Chile and its dictator Augusto Pinochet. Against shock of a military coup the nation's economy was radically liberalized, immediately impoverishing millions of its citizens and those who asked for a say in the country's future were disappeared, tortured and murdered. This was replayed again and again through Latin America, Russia and several other countries up until the present.     The Shock Doctrine reveals the sordid details of this radical approach to capitalism, the motivations of its adherents, its methods and terrible results. This is a must read book for anyone concerned about the current state of the world and how it got there. The fortunes of any country and the world at large is inextricably tied to economic forces and this book shows how the dark side of capitalism can wreak untold havoc on countries and people, impoverishing the masses while the rich grow even richer. I give it the highest recommendation.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|To tell the truth I was expecting a much better album from MK after having bought 'Kill To Get Crimson' And yes I definitely say as for lyrics (great to listen to different stories from the past) and musical instruments applied 'Get Lucky' is my favourite MK album.<br />'Get Lucky' resembles the 'Golden Heart' album in terms of using similar or the same musical instruments. If anyone wants to 'get back' the former Mark 'Dire Straits' Knopfler has to wait for good. This one is another style and also great. 'Get Lucky' is highly recommended.
0684833395|5.0|Yo Yo Yo, here I go again.  This is MC Book Review reviewing Catch 22.  I mostly read this book, because I wanted to know what \\"Catch 22\\" meant.  Apparently it means something different than what I thought it did.  I thought it meant something like you achieved a great goal or something.  Like a fisherman who had caught 21 fish and caught one more and would say, \\"Yo, that was a Catch 22\\".  So I have been going around and saying stuff like, \\"Yo yo yo, I just got payed.  What a Catch 22!!!\\"  I don't think anyone else around me knew what it meant either, because they would give me high 5's and stuff.  Now I feel like Will Ferrel from Anchorman.  \\"When in Rome\\".
1416955070|3.0|The story goes with the team of the supernatural which is so popular (with the Twilight saga). I got this book, because of S. Meyer review. I am not disapointed with the story, but I didnt love it. Its not to original, but its entertaining. Now for the mothers that are interested on what your children read, I dont recomend it for kids. There is no sex, but the book ends with the two main characters falling in love and finding out that they are brother and sister. Nothing really happens between them (just some kissing), but when you start being ok with this kind of things (seeing it as something normal), you know that something is really wrong. I just can imagin what a girl would think: \\"its not fair. it´s ok to be in love, they didnt know they were related. They weren´t race as family\\". A young mind should not be having this kind of thoughts.   Now, if you are not to young (like me) and enjoys fiction it´s OK. I am going to buy the complete triology. But if my daughter wants to read it, she will have to wait until she is like 18 or 20. Remember: you keep what you read.

0143038583|4.0|I was recommended to read this book by a vegetarian yoga instructor several years ago and never got around to it.  After several years, I was ready to hear the message and remembered the title.  Most books that indict the way we Americans eat are very one-sided with a left wing agenda, i.e. Skinny Bitch.  This book is totally focused on the facts and leaves the author's opinions out of it.      Michael Pollan does intensive, detailed research and lets the facts shape the reader's opinion. No scathing rant could be nearly as effective in revealing the U.S. food industry's relentless drive for maximum profits and efficiency.  Mr. Pollan has done and continues to do a great service by pulling back the curtain on where our food comes from.

0060925000|5.0|A friend asked me why any book needed to be 1,500 pages long. I explained: the author needed the first 500 pages to get the reader familiar with the characters and their relationships, introduce the readers to the setting and to get the storyline started; then, within the next 500 pages he had to stir up things a bit so the story line could more fully develop and the reader could feel a part of the process; and finally, the author had only 474 pages left to get to the climax and resolve everything (not an easy task, I can assure you). Hence, a book of nearly 1,500 pages - and I can only imagine the editing it took to keep it to that size.<br /><br />Seth managed to get all of this done without the book dragging at any point. That is unique. This being India, we have politics mixed with religion; caste mixed with both; and extended family is overriding everything.<br /><br />The convolutions surrounding the finding of a husband for Lata, the main storyline, reminded me of Samuel Richardson's 'Pamela' and 'Clarissa'. There are seemingly dozens of other storylines running throughout the book, all interrelated.<br /><br />We get to know the people so well that the myriad of details aren't overwhelming. This is not a great place to someone new to Indian literature to start; perhaps start with Narayan. But, don't forget to come back to this one later.<br /><br />Overall, this was phenomenally well written.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|Ok, I'm going to tick off the \\"real\\" Muse fans by saying that I am one of those who found Muse through \\"that vampire movie\\" (thank god). I went and bought Black Holes and Revelations, Origin of Symmetry, Absolution and Showbiz (in that order) within a couple of weeks and just received HAARP for my birthday. Muse has brought me back to listening to songs - not just instrumentals. My taste over the last 15 years has tended to run more towards classical and score music, and at work the radios play \\"classic\\" rock and pop so as not to offend any clients near by.  So, quite frankly, I would've NEVER discovered Muse without Twilight - which would've been a shame!      Ok, so that is my background, and the long-term fans can turn away from this review right now.  For those looking for a comprehensive track-by-track review, please check out M Chris Billing's review - it is a wonderful critique of this album and I think it will be very helpful for many (although I disagree with his line-up that puts the Symphony in the middle instead of the end, which I'll explain in a bit).    Prior to The Resistance, Absolution was my favorite album (recently edging out Black Holes after MUCH listening).  I think the reason that The Resistance has taken the top slot is because of the mix of styles in it, from classical elements (Chopin, Samson & Delilah, and the Symphony) to a hint of Queen (United States of Eurasia) and a touch of U2 (Resistance - easily a standout on this album).  Undisclosed Desires definitely has the Depeche Mode thing going (a risk - but it works).  MK Ultra and I Belong To You are simply great (I really like the change over to Samson & Delilah and then the change back).  And I think Uprising, overall, is a solid song that is easily accessible to more than just Muse's regular fans.  Others have said Unnatural Selection is too much like Micro Cuts, but since Origin of Symmetry is my least favorite Muse album, I can't confirm that; I haven't listened to it enough.    Now, one of my favorite songs on this album is Guiding Light, which I notice no one else is impressed with.  Others have called this song the weakest on the album, but I actually think it is just the simplest, most straightforward song on the album...and to me simple does not equal weak.  This simplicity is very powerful to me.  I especially like the lead-in from US of E and Collateral Damage; this song just flows out of that one.      Last, but definitely not least, the Exogenesis Symphony in 3 parts.  These songs alone are worth the price of this album.  The combination of Muse and an orchestra is simply amazing.  In Billings's review, he mentions he would have put this as the centerpiece of the album instead of the ending, but I disagree on that point.  To me it is the grand finale, and I think it would have seriously annoyed me to move from Part 3 (Redemption) into another song.  The album starts with the rhythmic beat of Uprising and ends with Matt at a piano.  That order works just fine for me.    This album is a bit of a risk for Muse with the classical elements and glimpses of influences from other bands, but I highly recommend it.
B000LE16VW|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites and I had to watch it once again when I heard the news about Patrick Swayze. Wheen I saw him interviewed earlier this year he had so much grace and strength.....    Here he plays a man who is killed, but like Ghost Whisperer, he is not able to leave until unleft matters are taken care of with his wife, Demi Moore.  Whoopi Goldberg is wonderful as the psychic who brings the two together.    A wondrful love story that is also more - there is tension, mystery and comedy as as Swayze works to protect Moore from a plot that has unfolded to obtain money.  A classic movie that should be owned by any movie fan and one I will always enjoy.
0385504225|2.0|I listened to this book on tape and was so glad I had other things to do while listening.  Aside from the DC and the Freemasonry historical references, which I did find interesting initially, but repetitive and preachy, I think the rest was cliche: the villain always one step ahead, bloodthirsty, and almost invincible; the hero stumbling in the dark; the CIA - now that actually, of everything in the book, surprised me in turning out to be the \\"Good Guys\\" - though why couldn't they tell the hero at the start; and last and least the denouement - Of course that's where it would be and what would be there...what a let down.
B000002KDI|5.0|Neil Young is one of the most creative people to have ever lived. The music of this album is a great work of art. There are many places where Mr. Young's skill with his guitar are very pleasingly evident. I forgot how good he is. This is also a testament to how pure and sweet his high notes were in his younger days. As I listened to this cd, I realized that he has a tremendous number of melodies that those who know him immediately recognize after three or four notes. And the poetry of his lyrics is astounding. In Cortez the Killer, the line \\"His subjects gathered round him like leaves around a tree\\". How beautiful a picture (even if it may have been more a wish than reality). Neil has painted some of the most beautiful and memorable pictures of any musician. There is the negative aspect of his which seems to be the failure of his music when he is preaching. His masterpieces greatly out way his failings, however. I believe that when all is said and done, Neil will shine brightly in the rockey sky.
1400049628|5.0|I used to stay awake all night in cold sweat fearing that zombies were coming for me [Dramazation]. This book told me what to do when the dead do inevitably rise again. For instance, I now know that a bank safe is NOT a good place to be during a lvl. 2-4 outbreak. Despite the immediate advantages such as protection- \\"The steel walls of a bank safe could stop even zombies armed with rocket launchers (No, zombies do not know how to use rocket launchers)...\\"- Quote from the Zombie Survival Guide.- you would eventually run out of air and food in a vault. This book informs you on what guns to use, how many to have and what melee weapons to bring along. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has any remote fear of zombies in any way.
0316017922|5.0|Great book!!! As it says it will change the way you look at the success. I enjoyed reading it and shared the thoughts with other people. I will recommend it to everyone.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I'm glad this was finally brought onto DVD. We had it recorded off tv, but seeing the unedited version was much more entertaining and I loved watching it again! The music is great and the storyline is interesting, not to mention it is fun to see some of the other actors making a special appearance, especially Steve Martin's character!
B002GY9F9K|1.0|The first few are fairly close to the book story, and I was fairly excited by how they did them, particularly the fight scenes.  After that, just pretend you've never seen the books.

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|I have been a huge fan of this band since first discovering them when \\"Stupid Dream\\" was first released based on the recommendation of someone I knew on the Internet.  I fell in love with that album, and as with most bands that impress me that much, I go out and buy their entire back catalog.  The amazing thing abut PT is that you hear something different on every album, yet something that carries over from the previous one; it's like a long musical journey that unfolds with every album released.  They change, they grow, they evolve; and the latest release is no exception.  It captures many of the elements of the last three albums (the fantastic \\"In Absentia\\" and its follow-up \\"Deadwing\\" as well as the fine \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet\\"); that harder edge they were exploring...but now they seem to return to an earlier sound in their catalog.  Take the best elements from \\"In Absentia\\", \\"Lightbulb Sun\\", \\"Stupid Dream\\", and \\"the Sky Moves Sideways\\" and add the new elements of sound that are created as a result of this and their further musical exploration...and what you have is simply the best thing they have ever done.  It's is a stunning masterpiece that takes their music to the next level; one that is rare to hear from most rock (or progressive rock) bands of the modern era.  With this absolutely incredible musical statement, Porcupine Tree have raised the bar to a new height.    There is a reason there are two discs in the set, even though the 75 minutes contained within the release could have easily fit on one CD.  There is such a powerful and memorable musical experience contained in the 55 minute collection of \\"sub-songs\\" that combine to form the title track of the album.  You really do need a bit of a break after hearing it for the first time and digest what you've just heard.  The second disc, while in the same style as the first, simply serves as a coda to the brilliance of the first disc.  \\"The Incident\\"'s many parts range from silent and quiet moments to passages of outright fury reflecting the stories of each \\"incident\\" contained within.  The middle of the album has three pieces that combine to make the crux of \\"The Incident\\": \\"Your Unpleasant Family\\", \\"the Yellow Windows Of The Evening Train\\", and \\"Time Flies\\"...the latter a stunning 15 minute piece of music in its own right.  There are some great hooks, most especially on \\"The Blind House\\" and \\"Drawing The Line\\".  The sweet and thought provoking finale \\"I Drive The Hearse\\" is positively beautiful.  As for the second disc, all of the songs are excellent, but the stand out is \\"Remember Me Lover\\"; another beautiful and impassioned composition.    The caliber of musicianship on this album is unparalleled.  Gavin Harrison proves that he is probably the best drummer (along with Dream Theater's Mike Portnoy) in modern rock.  The bass playing of Colin Edwin is spectacular as he locks in with Harrison's driving beat to create a superb rhythm section.  Richard Barbieri's underrated keyboard work is absolutely stellar; he creates the palate of musical color which the rest of the band explore on top of.  His bubbling and ebbing synthesizers surface from time to time as a perfect accompaniment; no flashy keyboard solos or lightning fast runs...just wonderful and expressive sound.  And Steven Wilson's guitar playing is SPECTCULAR while his vocals soar and sooth simultaneously.  He is the guide, the teller of the stories, the cosmic narrator.    The production on this album is simply perfect and pure.  I have the Special Edition, and both the 5.1 mix and stereo mixes are totally opposite the current trend of high compression and loud sound with no dynamic range.  Steven Wilson is a master in the studio and has been for years, but this album is something special.  If you want a collectable with some beautiful photographs and paintings and cannot wait for the eventual DVD-A Advanced Resolution 5.1 mix to rear its head, then by all means pick it up while you can.  It truly is something special and is indeed a work of art.  Otherwise, purchasing this masterpiece on the regular two disc edition is essential.    This is quite simply the best album of the band's career and the best (progressive) rock album of 2009.  This is not just an album, it is a musical event.  Nothing else comes close and nothing probably ever will for the rest of this year.  Stunning, and highly recommended

1601251505|4.0|Ive been following the Pathfinder project since Paizo first announced they would be continuing to make products for WotC's (now-defunct) Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 line. There ere many changes made during the earlier versions of the game that i am surprised and pleased to see have reverted back with this the final product.<br />In covering the product itself, the book is extremely well put together and easy to navigate. The art is fantastic and the ink doesn't smear as it does in other products ive picked up. it's a big book, so it can be a pain to tote around, but essentially it combines what was the 3.5 players handbook and dungeon master's guide. Type is easy to read and it handles abuse pretty well.<br />Mechanics-wise, i like it a lot and think it's an interesting upgrade to a lot of the base 3.5 material. There are several changes to various classes, not so much with a look to balance, but to either bring them more in line with some of the splatbooks or to simply make them more appealing to play. There are changes i wish had been made, but i think what's been done otherwise is just fine. It's a good product, and im looking forward to running/playing in a Pathfinder campaign.<br />Ill admit i wouldnt chunk out the full 50$ cover price, but the amazon price is more along the lines what im willing to pay :D.<br /><br />Pick it up, i dont think most folks would be disappointed.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|Short and sweet - I loved this movie. If you are in love, have ever been in love or are planning to be in love, do yourself a favor and see this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are perfectly cast and the story was true to life ( one person is always MORE in love than the other - at least that's been my experience.) Again, go see this movie - I'll add it to my collection as soon as it is released on DVD.
0756405890|5.0|An incredibly well written, page turning, fantasy adventure!    Patrick Rothfuss creates a well narrated tale, with interesting characters, amazing descriptions of the world, and a unique and complex magic system.  This book is incredibly difficult to put down.    I read 720 pages in 3 days.  *A New Record!*    Story:  After some demonic creatures appear near a small farming village, a mysterious stranger with a dark past narrates the early years of his life to a scribe in order to clear up half-truths and exaggerated rumors about his fascinating life.    World:  The world is a medieval fantasy setting, but magic is more about endothermic reactions, chemistry, concentration, and complex runes than shouting \\"Magic Missile!\\"  There are some fantasy creatures, demons, and humanoid races, but this is a mostly a story about people.     Characters:  Kvothe is the main character and he's lived a very difficult life.  The book is about the trials, tribulations, and successes of Kvothe.  One complaint is that he may be too good at everything, but there are hints in the story that he's not your average human being.  Kvothe has many adversaries, friends, and mentors as he struggles through his quest for revenge.  He's an underdog and it's really easy to experience the ups and downs through him as he scrapes through challenges.  This is a great underdog story!    Writing Style:  The actual writing style of this book is outstanding!  All of the text just flows together from song lyrics, to environment descriptions, to dialogue, to the action... It's GREAT!    Action:  There is some action in the book; it's exciting, and easy to follow.  I wish there was a bit more, but the book is entertaining enough without it.  This is mostly a clever dialogue / quick thinking type of story, rather than a \\"chop a guy's head off with an axe\\" adventure.    Overall:  This is a great book!  It's not a perfect book, but it is incredibly entertaining.  It could have used more epic scenes, but the main character is a teenage student at a university through most of the story.      Read it if like cheering for underdogs that never give up, can appreciate complex magic, or want a more grown up version of Harry Potter.    I also think Robin Hobb and Witcher fans will appreciate this book quite a bit.    Avoid it if you want your good guys noble and honest, your books need to be crazy epic over the top adventures, or you need massive battles.  You'd probably say the book was boring.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Similar in style to The Da Vinci Code, this new tale is an engaging yarn which kept me hooked until I finished.  Some of the premises and extrapolations are far-fetched and wishful thinking, but the pace of the book keeps you engaged.

B00192KCQ0|3.0|I tried to like this album. But not once did it make me feel like playing air guitar or banging my head.    When an epic band that you love begins to release so so music, and show vulnerability in the media - then your perception of the band changes for the worse. I wish i felt as excited about the band as i did < 91.
B00278U1W0|2.0|I really loved to see Eric and Steve playing together again, and the show is amazing! The image on blu-ray is really incredible, and the selection of songs are also phenomenal. You will find very good musics like:<br /><br />* After Midnight<br />* Rambling On My Mind (**)<br />* Georgia On My Mind<br />* Little Wing<br />* Voodoo Chile<br />* Can't Find My Way Home (**)<br />* Cocaine<br /><br />The down side of the blu-ray is the sound quality, reason why I'm returning the blu-ray (and will try the DVD - hope it is better), is horrible with an intermittent noise on the guitars, for both: Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood. I tried both formats DTS and Dolby, but the noise persist. I read other reviews for the blu-ray format and I noticed I was not the only one complaining about the quality.<br /><br />It was good to hear my favorite Eric Clapton songs again (**), but if you are looking for a good quality sound, look for the Jeff Beck blu-ray - a fantastic show and excellent quality.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Really, it is difficult to find words to describe the wonderment of this BBC series.  I watched in on HD Cable when it first came out, and every time I pull out my Blue Ray DVDs and watch an episode, my breath still catches in my throat.  It is simply magnificent footage.  And you do not need to be a nature video lover to appreciate it.  I normally have absolutely no use for nature shows, but the time and care and effort that went into this project was so incredibly painstaking, they have created a masterpiece to be enjoyed for generations to come.  They have captured quiet, private moments of peace, joy and sorrow as well as heart-racing moments of predatorial instinct and struggle that define the  massive span of wildlife on our seven continents. Many of these moments were never captured on video until now. The thoughtful editing and interesting behind the scenes footage round out this beautiful series. I have the version that is narrated by Sigourney Weaver that I purchased directly from the Discovery website, and I purchased the version narrated by Sir David Attenborough for my Dad though Amazon.  I prefer Weaver's smooth, calm voice, which is the version that was aired on TV when the series premiered. Watch it, you will not be disappointed!
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I've been watching all of the seasons in succession over the summer, and I've loved them all.  While there are definitely good and bad episodes, overall this is a great series.  I appreciate all of the extras, and was not disappointed in the season eight DVDs either.  There were plenty of extras to make it worthwile to buy the DVD set, and the price was reasonable.  I also love that this season was released in a plastic case, instead of cardboard.  It's a sturdier design, but has a matching slipcover, so it blends right in with the other seasons.  Nice.
B002P79RIC|5.0|This has to be one of the best television shows on right now. In my opinion it is one of the best shows EVER. Dr. Sheldon Cooper is my new hero. :-)  I gave this a 5 star simply because the show is so funny. I also love the fact that i can stop the credits and read the hilarious writings of the writers at the end of each episode.  The only down side so far is I cant seem to find it out on blu-ray.

B0021L8US0|4.0|The start of this film really presented somewhat of a unique challenge for first time feature film director, Neill Blomkamp as it adopted a realistic documentary story telling style for the majority of this bizarre Sci-Fi picture. This was a unique style and for the entire time that was maintained I found myself being utterly enthralled by the whole ordeal. Something went wrong however, and in the last 45 minutes or so, Blomkamp abandoned that cinematographic method for a generic action sequence that, although still successfully told the story, took a lot away from what the first half of the film worked so hard to build up.  The curious but strangely inspired choice of Johannesburg, South Africa as the setting for this film really worked on a lot of levels and as I think more about it, I struggle to really believe if this film could have been set anywhere else and work just as well. Focusing on the main theme of racism, this film has a really powerful message to send and Blomkamp purposely does not try to gloss over the truly harsh nature of the events being depicted in the film.<br /><br />In 1982 a large alien mother ship was stranded hovering over Johannesburg unable to leave as some suspected the ship had lost its navigation device which was apparently seen falling from the mother ship but was never found. As exploratory team cuts their way into the ship to find a large number of insect-like aliens, malnourished and leaderless they are contained within a government district known as District 9. 20 years later a mass public hostility has grown towards the derogatorily labelled Prawns and a decision is made to move them to a new camp which would be safer for both humans and aliens. A private military contractor called Multinational United (MNU) is brought in by the government to move the now 1.8 million alien population to a new camp, District 10, placed 240 Kilometres outside of Johannesburg. Leading this mass relocation campaign is MNU field operative Wikus Van Der Merwe. During the time of him serving the eviction notices and inspecting the alien huts, he discovers an alien device which sprays dark liquid into his face and infects him with a virus that is slowly transforming him into a prawn. In order to be cured Wikus must team up with a prawn to help get the device back from the MNU and help the aliens return to the mother ship.<br /><br />Although the character of Wikus has a pivotal part in this film, the triumph of the whole feature is the alien species more affectionately named, Prawns. The creation of New Zealand based Weta Workshop, famous for their work on the Lord of the Rings films, they made the conscious decision to create a creature that we could both be intimidated by and feel sympathy for. A lot of the latter emotion has to do with the eyes of the creature as they are truly the eyes inspired by a puppy dog. The creatures interact and behave exactly the same as humans do in the conditions the aliens have found themselves confined in. It comes across as a film about the third world conditions and the aliens as a metaphoric representation of how we treat things that are \\"alien\\" to us which I found to be quite an endearing aspect of the film. Wikus is the loveable loser who's faced with a massive obstacle that he really struggles to overcome and that is the largest part of his charm. He's a real person and although he does display a truly despicable side, his redeeming qualities outshine the evil nature we first see.<br /><br />The setting of Johannesburg, as mentioned before, is a truly inspired choice of setting for such a movie as is the general consensus with alien movies we would usually expect to see them set in some major US city. Johannesburg is a perfect choice to tell such a story as the desolate, detritus landscape of the alien slums is the only real setting that can tell this story and if set in an American city or state, I think this film would have struggled to achieve the same impact. Setting the alien story parallel to the true conditions in which the South Africans live allows for that additional element of terror and sympathy not just for the South African people but for the alien characters also. The gore and language of the film is smattered with 80s and 90s Sci Fi nostalgia, reminiscent of the likes of Robocop and Starship Troopers, which creates a more aggressive feel to the atmospheric tone of the film.<br /><br />Out of everything in this film that can be both praised and condemned the overall film works superbly to allow for one very enjoyable experience. Being the first major acting job of Sharlto Copley (Wikus), this is without a doubt the stepping stone that will lead onto an immensely successful career for this very talented actor. I won't spoil the end but it is open ended and there is certainly room for a sequel which I hope we will see at some point. I am especially optimistic with the news of Blomkamp expressing interest in creating a sequel. I would say you should really see this film in any way you possibly can as it's genuinely worth your time. It may not be the best film you will ever see in your lifetime, but it will definitely be one that you will have a fondness for.o the true conditions in which the South Africans live allows for that additional element of terror and sympathy not just for the South African people but for the alien characters also.

B002BSHWUU|4.0|I love the sound of this new box set. Since other, more knowledgable reviewers have scrutinized it and already expressed their opinions in detail, I won't add to the raving, cheering and (some little) jeering regarding the remastering. Suffice it to say, if you love the Beatles, you cannot go wrong with either this or the mono box. I did opt for the stereo one not only for the sound (I tend to prefer stereo over mono), but for practicality. Since the stereo titles are available individually, I need not worry if one gets scratched, damaged or misplaced; I'll just trot off to the nearest outlet and buy a new one. With the mono box, you don't have that safety net should the unthinkable happen. Which brings me to the packaging, and bless all the previous reviewers who provided warning as to what to expect. Unlike the mono box cds, which have miniature LP sleeves along with protective plastic, the stereo cds slide in and out of cardboard slots which on some of the selections (for example, the White Album), are a very tight fit indeed. So...I purchased a bunch of slimline jewel cases, very carefully removed the discs from the original packaging and stored them in the slimlines.  I felt a bit miffed having to do this after paying so much for this box set, but it is what it is and the packaging could have been more thoughtfully designed. It's a shame that both of these otherwise superb box sets have such serious flaws that could have been avoided. Five stars for the music and the remastering, and deduct one star for the packaging.

Some of it's good, some of it is kinda out there.    The book is divided into three sections - Ram Dass's journey, spiritual enlightenment writings, and lastly how you can go down the path to enlightenment.  He has a good message.  The only moment you will ever be in is the here and now.  He is a Buddhist, and keeps in line with their philosophy of enlightenment through cutting your attachments to your ego, your thoughts, and desire.     While a lot of this advice is good, I don't wholly subscribe to the Buddhist philosophy that to be pure you must drop your ego and all desires and merge yourself with the universe.  Is one human after one does this?  Unless you plan to be a monk and meditate all day and have no personality, I don't think this is very realistic.    All things in moderation, you can take away something good from this book.  Most of our unhappiness comes from our attachments to desires, trying to control the future, and letting our thoughts control us.  When we step back away from that, we feel more at ease.  So just be here now.

Edition (Special Collector's Edition)]].<br /><br />And though I've seen it several times since then, I really couldn't remember why I liked the movie so much.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I was 3 years old in 1980, the year I discovered the band that would change my life forever.  My mother's record collection was like looking at a mysterious treasure chest sitting there on the floor of her closet.  I would always sneak in there, pull out a few of the records, and gaze in amazement at the covers.  My mother told me, \\"You can look at any of my records but you are not to touch my Beatles records in the front.\\"  That was all it took.  I nagged and nagged her to show me these \\"extra special\\" records that I was forbidden to touch.  One day she took her collection out to the living room, slapped side two of \\"The White Album\\" on the turntable and I was mesmerized.    Since that first introduction, I've always known The Beatles' songs in stereophonic sound.  My mother never bought a mono Beatles album, not even in the '60s.  I learned of mono mixes when I purchased the book \\"The Beatles' Complete Recording Sessions\\" in high school.  I figured all mono mixes just sounded like, what I would later find out was called, a stereo \\"fold down\\" where both stereo channels are combined onto one track, creating nothing more than a compressed sounding version of the stereo mix.  When I started hearing about how different the mono \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" was compared to the stereo, I eventually sought out and scored a decent vinyl copy.  I was amazed at all the cool differences I heard in the mono version!  Especially the phasing effect used on the vocals for the chorus of \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" and the delayed intro to the \\"reprise\\" version of the title track.  If only I could have this version on CD!  In 2009, the dream of many a Beatlemaniac has finally come true.  From \\"Please Please Me\\" to \\"The White Album,\\" and for all of their singles from 1963 to 1969, The Beatles created a separate mono and stereo mix for each song.  Some original mono mixes have been available on CD, some have not.  But never have ANY of them been available looking or SOUNDING this good!  \\"The Beatles In Mono\\" box set is gorgeous!  All of the original mono L.P.s are presented in authentic Japanese replicas, right down to the original inserts and sleeves included inside!  The CD's comes in a rice paper sleeve that you can place INSIDE the paper sleeve that comes along with it. I don't see how this set could have been manufactured any better.  But what's the preference, mono or stereo?  Both have their merits and if you're a hardcore Beatles fan you should have both.  Let's break it down by year shall we?   1963:  One listen to PLEASE PLEASE ME in it's entirety and you'll know why this is one of the greatest debut albums in the history of rock and roll.  This album is just so gosh darn CONSISTENT for it's time!  Because The Beatles were recording on twin track tape machines, the mono mix is the way to listen to this album.  If you think the original CD release from 1987 sounded good, wait 'till you hear this one.  Their second, WITH THE BEATLES, is nearly as good.  Though the mono mix may be preferred, I like this album in both formats simply because I grew up with stereo versions of these songs.  The first big difference you're going to hear between the two mixes is the intro to \\"Money (That's What I Want).\\"   1964:  It's a toss up between the mono and stereo versions of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT and BEATLES FOR SALE.  If you want a more clear, spread out, surround sound go for the stereo versions.  If you want a more cohesive, live sounding performance from the Fabs, then go for the mono.  I absolutely loved the blending of John and Paul's harmony vocals on \\"Baby's In Black.\\"  You'll also hear Paul hit his high register note for the line \\"was in vain\\" perfectly on \\"If I Fell\\" instead of the strain he does on the stereo version.    1965:  The mono version of HELP! isn't as murky as some people have said it is.  The mono version of the title track most definitely contains a different lead vocal track from John.  That's obvious.  On the monoCD you get the original 1965 stereo mix as a bonus which prompted me to ask the question, \\"What was wrong with it?\\"  Sounds fine to me!  You may prefer the original stereo mix over the '86 digital mix.  I do.  As for RUBBER SOUL, both mixes sound great!  \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" features a longer fade on the mono.   1966:  Here's where you're really going to start hearing the differences between the stereo and mono mixes.  REVOLVER is essential in both mixes.  The \\"I look at all the lonely people\\" of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is much more blended.  There is more backwards guitar on \\"I'm Only Sleeping.\\"  \\"Love You Too\\" features a longer fade at the end.  You can clearly hear John's reply of \\"life of ease\\" on \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and the strummed acoustic guitar starts right as Ringo's vocal does.  There is no cymbal flourish from Ringo for the last verse of \\"And Your Bird Can Sing.\\"  The fade out to \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" is completely different.  And the tape loops on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" rise and fall much more rapidly while the middle eighth backwards guitar break sounds downright FREAKY!    1967:  The mono SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND really is the way to go when listening to this album.  What they've always said about the mono mix of \\"She's Leaving Home\\" really is true.  Slowed down on the stereo mix, the emotion doesn't come through the same.  On the mono version, the strings will pierce your heart and so will Paul's vocal.  MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR is presented as a mini replica of the American Capitol album.  Differences?  The last bit of scat vocals on \\"Flying\\" are missing and the fade is longer with more mellotron.  Both of the creepy sounding \\"aahs\\" after George's first two lines in \\"Blue Jay Way\\" are missing and the distorted cello chops off suddenly at the end.  Ringo's drums are \\"phased\\" for \\"Your Mother Should Know.\\"  For \\"I Am The Walrus,\\" Ringo's snare doesn't start the 2nd verse and the backing track falls out completely after John's \\"I'm crying\\" in the 2nd verse.  You get to hear \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\" as everyone heard them both in the '60s.  The \\"leslied\\" piano on \\"Baby, You're A Rich Man\\" comes in much sharper after the verses.  \\"All You Need Is Love\\" has a longer fade with the orchestra playing \\"Greensleeves\\" and both the bass and the drums come in right as the band starts singing \\"Love, love, love.\\"    1968:  For THE WHITE ALBUM, good gosh, where to begin?!  For starters, the sound effects are in different places for \\"Back In The U.S.S.R.(Paul's \\"Yeah, ooo yeah\\" is missing during the guitar solo),\\" \\"Blackbird,\\" and \\"Piggies.\\"  There are no hand claps at the start of \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.\\"  One particular multi-tracked vocal from Paul on \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" stands out way more than the rest.  Paul's harmony on \\"I'm So Tired\\" stands out more than on the stereo.  George's last yelp on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is missing.  John's muttered \\"down\\" is missing before the \\"I need a fix\\" section of \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" and the \\"Mother superior\\" section sounds much heavier.  The fiddle coda is different to \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" (as well as the tape being sped up a bit for the mono mix).  The bass starts later on \\"I Will.\\"  \\"Yer Blues\\" sounds about five times dirtier than it does in stereo.  \\"Helter Skelter\\" is missing it's fade down and up that includes Ringo's famous scream.  George's double tracked vocal on \\"Long, Long, Long\\" is out of place for the first verse and the organ is pushed down in the mix.  And \\"Savoy Truffle\\" features a extra bar after the guitar solo plus an extra heavy sounding last verse....\\"Cream tangerine.\\"  The mono mix of THE WHITE ALBUM seems to have a more cohesive power than the stereo version does, like you're watching a play with 30 different acts.  I think it's because of the aural consistency that takes place with the mono, as opposed to stereo where your ears and mind have to readjust to every track whether you know it or not.    1962-1970:  MONO MASTERS contains all the singles as they were originally first heard.  The riff for \\"Paperback Writer\\" is going to hit you harder than ever before!  \\"Revolution\\" is a masterpiece of DISTORTION and the previously unreleased mono mix of \\"It's All Too Much\\" from \\"Yellow Submarine\\" rocks even harder than the stereo version.  I don't know what else to say but if you are a hardcore Beatles fan, you need this.  The demand for this box set has been out of control, surpassing EMI's expectations.  To all my fellow Beatle Brethren, I hope you get the opportunity to hear this set for yourself.  Mind blowing.

037571457X|4.0|Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi is a graphic memoir detailing her childhood in revolutionary Iran. I have read a few other books from this time period and so far all of them have given different accounts of the revolution and just what it meant for the people of Iran and for the country itself. Yet the basic facts remain the same.<br /><br />Satrapi's memoir isn't a dry telling of events her words are poignant and honest and told only as a child can tell it - even though she was an adult when she wrote this. Satrapi's memoir gives the reader a clear and straight forward telling of the events as she saw them. The comic book style only add to the power of her words give an additional layer of detail to events that can be hard to describe with just words.<br /><br />While I may not have always agreed with Satrapi's interpretations I couldn't fault her reasons for them. I also took heart in the small acts of defiance that she, her mother and other women in Iran showed when wearing the veil (among other restrictions) was forced upon them. Satrapi grew up in an uncertain and war torn world where what is known and believed can be changed overnight. Her memoir clearly shows how unnerving that can be and how with the power of family you can still find solid footing even though the world around you is shaking.<br /><br />[...].

0060765488|4.0|This book still had all of the wonder and magic that it had for me when I was a kid. In fact, the book probably means more to me now then it did then. Because now I can understand all the various undertones of the story. When I first read the book I was too young to understand all that was going on under the surface of the main plot. So, to be able to see and digest all the many layers made the book more rewarding and enjoyable. This is a great series and I plan on re-reading the rest of the books at some point.<br /><br />[...].
B002NY731U|5.0|this albym is a good blend of classic and contemporary Megadeth. Much of the album is solid thrash, real old school 'Deth. i love this album and would say it is going to end up being one of there best albums. Endgame is as political as Megadeth has ever been, and that makes for a good sound, if you are a fan of metal or hard rock at all i would highly racomend Endgame.
0061689246|5.0|Normally when I know that there is a movie that I want to see that was based on a book I will try to read the book first. Usually I find that without a doubt the book is ALWAYS better than the movie. However, that isn't the case with Stardust by Neil Gaiman.<br /><br />While there are parts of the book that I like better than the movie....there are also some parts of the movie that I liked better than the book. The book was enjoyable and well worth the read. Just as the movie is well worth the viewing.<br />The characters are well written, although some of them not as fleshed out as in the movie, and the plot was good. The villains could probably have been more villainous, but overall they weren't so horribly written that you became disgusted with them.<br /><br />[...]
0316096199|2.0|As one who enjoyed \\"The Lovely Bones\\" (until the end, which struck me as more artifice than art), I was severely disappointed by Ms. Sebold's memoir. Like \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" the beginning of \\"Lucky\\" starts strong, the events she relates are gripping and well told, and we are drawn into the narrative's chilling details because of her almost clinical point of view. However, the rest of the narrative is far less engaging. For the most part, \\"Lucky\\" struck me as an inauthentic, clumsy, and occasionally cliched reporting of an event that Sebold has yet to deal with and recover from emotionally. We are told a series of episodes in Sebold's life, some that are relevant to the rape, others that appear thrown in for no apparent reason other than they may have been associated in her mind in some way with the rape. Unfortunately, Sebold relies almost entirely on telling us the logical connections between events; rarely does she shows us the emotional connections and, more importantly, her emotional reactions to them. In short, I felt cheated by Sebold's lack of emotional engagement with her ordeal. The fact that she eventually resorted to heroin and a series of emotionally-detached serial sex partners makes me wonder how she could categorize the last section of the memoir as the \\"Afterword.\\" Clearly she was still in the grips of PTSD, which was, from my perspective, where the memoir should have begun. Of interest to everyone, not just other women who have been raped, or, for that matter, anyone who has experienced a traumatic event (the death of loved one, the horror of war) is this: how did she recover her former self-respect and self-confidence to the point of being able to turn this traumatic experience around and use it not only as the focus of a memoir, but as the gist of a best-selling novel? By the end I was still wondering if Sebold ever recovered from the effects of the rape.    Perhaps I was left with this question because Sebold's irritating self-absorption killedany sympathy I may have had for her as both the central \\"character\\" and and the narrating author. Rather than take us into the fear, panic, loneliness, even alienation from others she must of felt during and after the attack, most of the time we hear Sebold's \\"author\\" voice summarizing and sanitizing every experience. Ironically, we could infer that in her own life Sebold failed in her roles as loving daughter, compassionate friend, and caring lover because in the memoir we see her exerting an almost obsessive, predicable, even mechanistic control over all of her relationships. Take her desperate need for Lila's friendship after the rape. When Lila eventually \\"dumps\\" her, Sebold takes pains to describe how she was snubbed publicly. Where is her private grief at the loss of her closest friend? In fact, who is Lila, apart from Sebold's \\"clone\\" or, as Sebold seems to suggest, her doppelganger? That Sebold can only describe Lila as a reflection of herself (literally, Lila is raped on Sebold's bed), would be repugnant if it weren't for the fact that Sebold seems totally unaware that she is abusing a real person for literary effect. Moreover, except for the inclusion of her poem \\"Conviction,\\" which is emotional catharsis dressed up as a literary exercise (merely clever, but not convincing), Sebold would have been far more convincing had she quoted directly from her journals (which she frequently mentions) to show us authentic expressions of grief, loneliness, anger, depression in all its unmediated rawness.     Ultimately, like any fictional narrative, a successful memoir must exhibit the qualities of good story telling: include only what we need to know, show rather than tell, and most importantly, leave the reader with something experienced, felt, and learned \\"with\\" the author, not \\"by\\" the author. Sadly, Ms. Sebold's memoir failed to convince me that she lost more than just her virginity that night in the tunnel.
0375714669|4.0|Persepolis 2 by Marjane Satrapi is a graphic memoir detailing her high school years away from Iran and her eventual return to the country of her birth. This book is a follow up to her Persepolis and pretty much starts off where the first book left off.<br /><br />Once again Satrapi uses the graphic style to tell her story and the visuals really add to her words and in a few places taking the place of words altogether giving weight to the phrase that a 'picture tells a thousand words.' In this part of her story Satrapi chronicles the isolation she felt while going to school in Austria. The uncertainty of never really fitting in to any one group and the search of trying to figure out just who she was. While in Austria she experienced so many freedoms that she never could have dreamed of while living in Iran. She also had to deal with peoples misperceptions of what it meant to be Iranian. In the end, once she graduated from high school she felt that the only way to learn who she was, was to return to the country of her birth.<br /><br />Once back in Iran Satrapi faces a new struggle. The one of trying to fit back into a box that she no longer fit into. It was a hard reality for her to face when she realized that she had become so adjusted to the freedoms she had in Europe that she forgot what living in the repressive atmosphere in Iran was like. Satrapi had fled back to Iran looking for a place to belong and instead she found that even there she didn't have an identity. She was too westernised now to fit comfortably back into her old skin.<br /><br />Satrapi does a wonderful job of telling her story and in conveying all the emotions and the struggles that she faced both at school in Austria and back home in Iran. Her search to find out her identity was at times tragic and at others times amazingly beautiful. Her style of writing and drawing really conveyed all the emotions that she must have been feeling at the time. I thoroughly enjoyed this additional glimpse into Satrapi's life and will be on the look out for any additional works that she might come out with. What can I say....sometimes I'm a horrible voyeur!<br /><br />See my other reviews at tickettoanywhere.blogspot.comon the look out for any additional works that she might come out with.

B001FB4VZS|3.0|The cast returns for a new, and decidedly darker season of the runaway hit series.  After resolving last year's cliffhanger, Clark decides to leave Smallville behind and focus his energy on the Daily Planet, where he can more closely monitor the goings on of the crime-plagued city.  This, of course, means more time for Lois and Clark to gel.  Meanwhile, Tess Mercer steps in to steer the Luthor empire in the absence of Lex.  Oliver Queen returns to continue fighting greed and corruption with the still fledgling Justice League.  And Chloe embarks into some very dark territory in the increasingly tragic love triangle between her, Jimmy Olsen, and new character Davis Bloom.    The producers effectively dodged the bullet of losing Lex from the show.  Cassidy Freeman is an excellent choice to pick up the mantle as Tess Mercer.  She is commanding on screen, strong in the right places, and also vulnerable in just the right measure at all the right times.  Justin Hartely (Queen) and Aaron Ashmore (Olsen) also bring much to the table with expanded roles this season.    The biggest change is that these episodes are much more connected than in the past.  The major arc becomes a leading factor in almost every episode.  Indeed, this season of Smallville might be more aptly dubbed Splitsville, as in splitting the viewers.  On the one hand, there are those who feel this darker and more connected direction is the boost in the arm the show needed to stay fresh.  Then, there are others who miss the former days where each week was its own story, and the larger arc was more of a background factor, mostly relegated to mid-season and season finale episodes.    I can see both sides - there were moments when the epic nature of the season made me nearly forget the teen-angst ridden past it has risen from.  Yet I couldn't help but miss the more lighthearted touches of the former days.      Indeed, this season has a serious lack of humor.  That's not to say it is wholly absent,  but it is rare.  Erica Durrance's fantastic work as Lois is too seldom utilized this season, and the episodes in which she is absent are harder and harder to get through as the season progresses. The few times she is allowed full reign are priceless, including STILLETTO, in which she assumes her own superhero identity to try to break a front page story, or HEX, in which Chloe inadvertently becomes Lois through a wish and a little magic.  Also fun is the return of Linda Lake (Tori Spelling) who forces Clark to reveal his secret to the world in the episode INFAMOUS.      These \\"fun\\" episodes are rare respites in a season that is mostly focused on the brutal character of Doomsday, who is here from Krypton to destroy the world.  Finding out which human is Doomsday ultimately forces Clark to face his ultimate issue - can he kill a human to save the rest of humanity.  This deep issue consumes the entire second half of the season.  Along the way is a five episode arc that brings back Lana and gives a proper and creatively logical end to the relationship between her and Clark, which is itself consistently tragic for the season.  And the finale, while not quite as big as former finale's, does hint at some major changes to come.    But of course, you cannot mention the finale without discussing what a major letdown it was.  Now, I don't judge it as harshly as others do.  As a tie up to the long running ethics discussion of the season, I actually thought it was pretty good.  The major shock near the end was, in my opinion, quite brilliant - and it made total sense in context of everything that people had been arguing with Clark about.  However, I will agree that the big showdown was woefully disappointing.  Far too short and lackluster.  When Clark and Doomsday landed at the power plant, I figured the gloves would come off and the BIG fight was about to start.  I was shocked when the screen faded to black.  WHAT!!?  This has been coming all season, the destruction of Doomsday, and we don'teven see it!?    But, even with this less than stellar final episode, I still think there is hope for the show yet.  They've had their season of ethical issues explored - they've recovered from the loss of Lex - and they've FINALLY rid the world of Lana Lang.  Now, what they need to do is let Season 9 be the end - which means in the course of the next season, Lois and Clark need to become dedicated reporters under the employ of Perry White.    I'm not going to tell you this is an overall bad season, it's not.  There is still plenty to get out of it.  But I will tell you that it's probably the first season I wouldn't go back and watch again.  However, it might serve a larger purpose in being a catalyst for what comes in Season 9.  I just hope they can bring back the fun that the show used to revel in.
B002GZQYMK|3.0|Uprising - was a promising and a solid Muse tune. Got a massive air play, so I guess everyone already heard it zillion times. Lyrically, it's average at best. I'm already bored with it.    Resistance - the best song on the album. It consists of several parts (like 4 or 5) that are beautifully executed and crafted together. From start to finish this song shines. It's one of their best work.    Undisclosed desires - Oh... Timbaland/Timberlake \\"influence\\"... it works though. It's a catchy, meaningless tune but is half finished. There's a copy & paste feel without the spark. It ends with the same chorus you already heard in the song without any change.    United states of EA - the most \\"fake\\" and dejavu song on this album. It's a Queen track with a typical Arabic & eastern spices than ends with a Chopin. Where's the Muse music here? Oh sorry, they were the performers...    Guiding light - another great and underrated song. This is a slow burner and you really have to listen to it a few times before you start to sink in. Again, parts of the music and his singing remind me as something on U2's Unforgettable fire. But nothing serious, it's a good track.    Unnatural selection - good, heavy with a catchy riff. What kills the song is the boring middle part that is a bit out of place and too long. What saves this song is that catchy riff that goes with \\"Counterbalance this commotion...\\" Unfortunately that riff is a total ripoff of one Abba song.    Mk Ultra - Muse track that is average at best (filler)... it's pretty heavy & synthy though.    I belong to you - great track, not entirely original, but works. It's a twisted, happy and daring. Real refreshment on this album. Not without the annoying parts - his french singing is lame. Why did he do that? To sound more important, different.... ROMANTIC? It's pathetic. He doesn't sound like a french guy so leave it. I really don't like when musicians try to sing on other languages with a strong native accent.    Exogenesis - too many people and press reviews praised this and my expectations were high. But for my taste, it's mellow and again I have the same dejavu feel I had before. It's the music you already heard in the closing credits. It didn't evoke my emotions. The overture promised but haven't delivered... Cross pollination was plain boring while Redemption starts like Moonlight sonata, but builds and is actually the best part of all. Maybe it needs time. The problem is, there aren't many hooks so I feel no need to return. If you want the real metal/rock opera, hear the Ghost love score from Nightwish. It's a work of genius.    All in all, I'm not impressed at all. Reviews blindly praised it, probably because Muse got a cult status. In reality, it's an ok record but MUCH worse than Black holes and Absolution. There are no strong tracks like Map of problematique, Starlight, Knights of Cydonia, Butterflies, Hysteria, Apocalypse, etc...   Everything they know best - rock with urgent, heavy, catchy, layered and screaming tracks - is not here. What's more disappointing is how they shamelessly ripped off many artists and musicians without thinking twice and now they sell it as their own creation. Lame. The next album will have to be their own or I will get rid of them for good.

Rothfuss is a man after my own heart with his descriptions of the University bar scene, it was definately something I could relate to. I loved how witty this book was at certain parts, especially during a certain ballad.<br /><br />To be honest, I can't wait to re-enter Kvothe's world.

B0025KVLUQ|3.0|The Beatles were before my time and undoubtedly I do not appreciate them as much as I would have had I heard them when their music was new.  I have had to wade back from my musical birthing grounds in the early 80's through countless songs undoubtedly influenced by or stemming from a musical inheritance from the work of The Beatles.  To remain true to my subjective perspective, I cannot provide the best testimony to their value and influence.<br /><br />Come Together - Groovy cool song; heavy sound but laid back.  I imagine the lyrics were considered \\"totally far out man\\" at the time.  They are still inventive and poetic.  With lyrics that balance sense with non-sense you can achieve an unconscious impact that can make it harder to separate lyrics from music.<br /><br />Something - Sultry keyboards and guitar and strings all melt together as they swell the sentimental passion.  Beautifully expressive guitar solo.  Poignant song that dilutes its sadness with hope.<br /><br />Maxwell's Silver Hammer - Back to the march step rhythm section of The Beatles earlier work; nursery rhyme lyrics and light-hearted music barely conceal the successive acts of violence making what is psycho a bit of crazy fun.<br /><br />Oh! Darling - 50s sound; Paul McCartney pleads desperately to good effect with his lover.<br /><br />Octopus's Garden - Part two of \\"Yellow Submarine\\"?  This song caught my attention as a child.  Guitar accents sound right for this underwater adventure.<br /><br />I Want You (She's So Heavy) - The sound here is reminiscent of \\"Come Together\\".  One reason I suspect that I don't like this song as much as I would like is that I am not a blues fan.  Another is that try as they might, The Beatles are not a blues band.  I have meager amounts of the blues to compare it to but it does not compare favorably.  Still they try admirably.  Also, this must be one of the Beatles' longest songs and for that reason also I wished I appreciated it more.  What was an appetite for the coda on \\"Sgt. Pepper...\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" has found its way deeper into the song bringing you to the progressive, instrument-oriented music not just once but twice.  This song has a psychedelic strain with a slightly disturbing wind sound that evokes a strange, alien atmosphere and then leaves you startled and gasping for breath at the song's abrupt end.  For me these are positive elements that don't make up for other elements in a song that I'm sure many will consider much more favorably than I do.<br /><br />Here Comes the Sun - Although this song's lighter than air openning is a stark contrast with its predecessor it moves towards a similar instrument-oriented progressive passage; this time in more favorable terms.  The guitar provides the elegant path through which this song strolls.  Again what would have been an interesting coda is brought in in the midst of the song and again at the end.  This same song form is used frequently by bands with superior instrumental abilities to great effect.  The Beatles ability to bring us into the high of \\"the jam\\" however is tragically limited.  This song and its predecessor point the way to a great many great progressive rock song.<br /><br />Because - Slow chant comes off slightly comic with its 60s mysticism, but poised as it is just before the Medley it is full of presentiment as well as sounding like a conclusion to what preceeded it.<br /><br />Medley<br /><br />You Never Give Me Your Money - This medley frames the songs ahead just as \\"Sgt. Pepper...\\" with its openning track and reprise framed that album.  There is a note of sadness under the light-hearted lyrics.  The various moods and melodies in this song also give it an overture-like, mini-medley feel preceeding the series of much shorter songs which follow.  Moreso than any of the other songs in \\"The Medley\\", this song could stand alone.  As the song fades we gradually discern night-time crickets and the next song starts right up...<br /><br />Sun King- ...as a kind of brother song to \\"Because\\" with its slow pace and 60s mysticism.  Hot summer day slow tribute to the sun I presume.  There is a strange tension between a joyous appreciation and a lazy tempo, a tension which resolves somewhat with the latin verses at the end.  Spills out into...<br /><br />Mean Mr. Mustard - ...a much shorter song that also picks up the tempo.  We have the familiar Beatles march style rhythm with the just as typical catchy tune.  One verse ends and...<br /><br />Polythene Pam - ...one more notch up on the tempo and on the energy brings us to the next song.  Complex drums, cryptic lyrics, rock guitar solo rests languidly on the rhythm section and drops us into...<br /><br />She Came In Through The Bathroom Window - ...the next song which has us in the bathroom relaxing the energy a bit.  The rhythm kicks back a notch and the guitar and the vocals have a vigorous back and forth.<br /><br />Golden Slumbers - After the first significant gap between songs since the medley began, sweet strings and gentle piano surge with passion and quieten again.  Two times we breathe in and out and then into...<br /><br />Carry That Weight - ...a triumphant anthem.  Horns come in to shout joy in a short progressive chorus.  Then the reprise of \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" comes in as if somehow we never left it so many melodies ago.<br /><br />The End - Sudden transition to a rock n roll mini-melody with an slightly understated drum solo.  One of the harder guitar solos for The Beatles is found here.  Another sudden transition brings up down a notch and back up for the final orchestral climax.<br /><br />Her Majesty - Couldn't leave on a serious foot; hidden track although not too far down the groove, an outrageous poke at nobility.<br /><br />(5 stars) I rate the medley (\\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" through \\"The End\\") as a single song with 5 stars.  The other songs on the album just don't add up to enough for me to justify a higher overall rating.  I'm sure that this has a lot to do with the fact that the elements of these songs I've heard first elsewhere and performed in ways I prefer.  Had I heard it first from The Beatles, my rating would have been higher.  I've chosen to rate the albums from my own subjective view.  This certainly will rub many people the wrong way but I think it is more honest.  Undoubtedly my favorite music will receive a great many ratings knocks from the majority that don't appreciate it.<br /><br />I heartily recommend \\"The Medley\\" to progressive rock fans for its outstanding collection of catchy tune ideas strung together in a highly effective way.  Although I am not as turned on by \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\"  and \\"Octopus's Garden\\" as I would like to be, those songs along with \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" may also appeal to the progressive rock fan.  As The Beatles bow out of the recording studio as a band an era of music has just been inspired that is where I find my heart and soul: progressive rock.Hot summer day slow tribute to the sun I presume.

B0000029LG|5.0|The Amazon editorial reviewer Steven Mirkin is way off base about this album. Some of Michael's masterpieces such as Stranger In Moscow, Earth Song, Tabloid Junkie, Scream. Money, They Don't Care About Us, Childhood and Smile are on this CD. This is a MUST HAVE. And the History 2 DVD is simply awesome and also a must have. No one made videos like Michael did. They're all masterpieces. This is a great collection of some of his very best videos.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love the show so much I wanted to share it with a friend. I bought this as a birthday present. I have read almost all of the books that True Blood is based on, and I appreciate them both separately. It's a great show to give a try if you haven't seen it already.
0316044695|5.0|In depth and personal view into the author's life before the SEALs, the training they underwent to earn that title and the mission that devastated his team. Gripping and by all means a page turner. I learned about and came to a respect and reverence for the SEALs and what they stand for.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This movie has it all: wonderful script, endearing kid actors doing a great job, dry English wit, sight gags galore, and outstanding set design and costumes. Mrs. Quickly's knick-knack strewn parlor is one of the greatest sets I've ever seen in any movie. Too bad the camera couldn't have lingered there a little longer. Very big laughs in our house when the measles medicine was going down. All in all, a triumph for Ms. Thompson.
0060594896|5.0|I was introduced to the work of Jack Canfield long after Chicken Soup for the Soul came on the scene. In fact, I was in rather a bit of resistance to Canfield's work because I thought it would be all about warm fuzzies. Not true! This book has some of the most practical advice of really making effective change in life, and not just for adults, but for young people as well. Jack Canfield uses his experiences asan educator, a psychologist and a someone who was mentored by W. Clement Stone to create a book that is phenomenal!  I have bought this book as gifts for my son, my bosses, and I would go as far as to say if this book was required reading in school, we would definitely have increased self-esteem, creativity and drive coming out of our schools and into the workfroce.  I cannot recommend this book enough. Also, consider getting the Audio Recording as well. You will listen to it over and over again!
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I had never heard of Muse, but I heard Glenn Beck mention this album and I HAD to check it out. Let me be honest, I do whatever Glenn Beck tells me to. Seriously, if he told me to go out and buy a pile of poop I would probably do it. It was a great suggestion on his part for me to buy this album. Pure libertarian bliss. The singers voice is a little high, which takes some getting used to, but overall this is great music for true patriots.<br />U-S-A!<br />U-S-A!<br />U-S-A!<br />U-S-A!<br />U-S-A!<br /><br />Edit 9/26/09: Apparently the sarcasm wasn't thick enough in this review for you all...
1563898586|3.0|I'd heard a lot of really good things about this book from different people, but after buying it I find myself asking, \\"Wha huh?\\" or saying, \\"Pffft.\\"<br /><br />As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the *idea* is a good one but the execution is lacking in a horrible way. Being a fan of comics and graphic novels in general but not enough to know people's names or what else they've worked on, I can't compare this book to anything else in order to point out its flaws. My main problem is this: the story itself bit the big one. Some of the characters were (I felt) inaccurate, the villain in the story was more amusing than anything else, and the plot was so artificial I literally had to force myself to finish.<br /><br />And now I'm going to say something that some might consider blasphemy<br /><br />The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen the book was just as bad as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen the movie.<br /><br />There I said it.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|I realy enjoyed Loreena's music. Excellent DVD, Excellent CD's[[ASIN:B000SO7OMA Loreena McKennitt: Nights from the Alhambra (Amaray - DVD + 2CD)]]
B000002NZO|4.0|or 3.5 stars. most mellow of early genesis lps. dont get the mca studio version-bassy, unclear, murkysound. all tracs are good. tracs 1,3,6 are heaviest; the rest are mellow. the best is 6 then 5, 2, 1, 3, 4 where the last 4 tracs are hard to prioritize. cd is long: apx 51mins, cuz they stretched the tracs too long. they could've made more songs instead. the best early lp of all genesis lps is NURSERY CRYME-only 38mins though.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Jason Mraz is Awesome... I can listen to him all day.... then add Colbie Caillat with him.... I'm in heaven!!!  We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things is a Great CD.... so talented, so bluesy, so many great songs on one CD!!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Super when I am on an airplane and have forgotten to turn on the wireless to pick up new books.  Doyle never ceases to amaze and provide entertainment.  I think I started reading Holmes in the 60s (early 60s) and have yet to stop.  Good emergency book to have if you have a Kindle and enjoy deductive reasoning.  easons to get it are elementary my dear reader!
B001CIPU3G|4.0|In my opinion, this is Trivium's best work to date. However, this band can do better. This is a band that creates enormous amounts of hype and is insanely talented, and their work is influenced by some of the best to grace our cd players. These guys are young, so they haven't quite found their true sound. The sheer fact that they are so young is mind-blowing. Ascendancy is their most popular work and alot of people's favorite collection. I, on the other hand think this is their best. The Crusade is an experimental album that saw the band take a different, and it was unsuccessful. We saw more of their influences style (Metallica mostly) than their own. Shogun is basically an extension and a more heavy approach of Ascendancy. This album shows more talent. Better and more riffs, Matt's vocals have improved, the solos are great, but i want more. This is a band that's capable of being one of the best bands of the 21st century.
B00005AG7K|5.0|I was looking for a DVD of Help and came across an offer for teh Magical Mystery Tour.  I had looked for this long ago and scratched it off my to get list.  What apleasant surprise.  Low price, good condition, fast shipment.  Truly magical and a nice memory fo many years ago in Europe/
B001GCUO16|1.0|I'm sure the movie is terrific but the blue ray would not play on my 3 month old player, the digital copy was unplayable on my state of the art mac, customer service was unavailable for both and I am extremely irritated.  The only customer service option was by filling out an online form and waiting -- well waiting longer than I want when I had movie night planned at a time certain.  I'm sure security is a concern but is it too much to ask that I be able to watch a movie I just purchased -- on new equipment -- without a multi-hour customer service component?
1594488916|3.0|The title of this book is great, isn't it? We readers, we do love books.    I loved that for a book about rare books, obvious care was taken with details about the physical book -- thick paper, the deckle edge of the pages (well, it might just be trimmed instead of cut, but there seems to be some gray area there).    I wish the writer wasn't so involved in the story itself. It's all academic in form -- endnotes (I like footnotes so much better, am I alone in this?) and all, very formal -- but the writer inserts herself into the pages. I can understand this later in the book, but I wonder why she didn't at least open the book with herself outside the story. I felt like this took away from the main characters she was trying to portray. As she inserted herself and her thought process into the book's pages, I also felt like she over elucidated. When there's a logical progression of thought, I, the reader, can follow those steps. I don't need someone to spell it all out for me. And sometimes I actually get frustrated by the speller -- it takes a lot of time, when I could otherwise be moving forward.    I did learn a lot from this book. I learned about the world of rare books. I learned about collecting and collectors.    As much as I say I love books -- and get excited when I get bookish packages in the mail and am sometimes disheartened by a lack thereof -- I can't imagine stealing books. Or even collecting rare books. I'm in it much more for the stories. To have books I felt like I couldn't read? Heartbreaking. As much as books are tangible objects, and I love their physical form, they're still, first and foremost, vehicles for story to me.

B002EWD08Q|4.0|I read that the album would really grow on you as you listened to it more, that turned out to be really true. At first listen, the album seemed dark, muddy and nothing really stood out. I was kind of shocked and disappointed. After 3-4 spins it started to take on a life of its own and the songs became distinct. If you look at the really good groups, they evolve. Not to compare them to Zep, but this is like Zep II vs. physical graffiti or houses of the holy, different, growing and great on it's own merits. How may songs can a group make that sound a like, with out one becoming bored. At the end of the day, this is clearly musical progress and growth for this band and maybe they will be around for a long time and endure. I am looking forward to what is next. I now can say I really like this album and it has it's own heaviness and catchiness, just in a different way. I will probably listen to it longer because the songs took time to grow, not wham bam thank you mam. If you buy it be open minded and give it some time, it will be worth it
B000002VMD|3.0|The Bodyguard soundtrack sold millions and millions of copies thanks to the song, I Will Always Love You. That song was written by Dolly Parton, Whitney's version is a homerun - but everytime I hear it now I kinda cringe. I Have Nothing and Run To You are the best tracks on here. I never cared for I'm Every Woman, I'd be so happy if I never had to hear that song again! This is when Whitney could really sang! Good soundtrack but not essential.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|Listening to \\"The Resistance\\" is exploring a world on the brink -- war, controlling governments, and a brewing revolution thinking about rising up. Those dark and conflictive sentiments boil slowly through Muse's fifth full-length album, which is equal parts brilliant and awkward. While many of the songs are exquisite and expansive, the whole synthy Depeche Mode vibe just doesn't work.<br /><br />\\"The paranoia is in bloom/the PR, the transmissions will resume/They'll try to push drugs to keep us all dumbed down/And hope that we will never see the truth around,\\" Matthew Bellamy sings over a stabbing bass melody and colorful swathes of electronica.<br /><br />That more or less sets the mood for the songs that follow, although they tend to be a bit more restrained -- the slow piano-and-drums build of \\"Resistance\\" blooms into a hard-rock explosion. Then there's some dancy synth-riddled melodies (I smell MTV), slow-burning stretches of bass-blazing prog, and hundred-mile-an-hour avalanches of volcanic hard-rock (\\"I'm hungry for some unrest/I wanna push it beyond the peaceful protest!\\"). Not to mention the truly brilliant, multifaceted expanse of \\"United States of Eurasia.\\"<br /><br />The last third is basically one big climactic build-up, followed by a spectacular musical finale -- it's like sitting through a good-but-not-great movie, and then being blown away by the final act. After the symphonic piano-rock of \\"I Belong To You (+ Mon Coeur S'ouvre A Ta Voix),\\" Muse begins a spectacular three-part \\"Exogenesis: Symphony\\" that harkens back to their older work, with string instrumentation blending seamlessly with the exquisitely painful, rich Britrock.<br /><br />I've adored everything that Muse has ever produced, even the albums that didn't quite rise to their full potential, but \\"The Resistance\\" strays too far from their signature sound to be truly engaging. It still has some rich rock songs that blaze with internal fire on their own, but don't really stick together into a cohesive album.<br /><br />The first few songs of \\"The Resistance\\" are rather awkward, with lots of fuzzy hard-rock, buzzing bass and a glitzy synth sound -- and some like \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" is the stuff of art-rock nightmares. You keep expecting Britney Spears' robotic voice to chime in.<br /><br />But gradually the classical and hard-rock influences start to blend more seamlessly, and you end up being swept away by the lush expansiveness of \\"United States of Eurasia\\" or the aching \\"Unnatural Selection.\\"There's also a hefty dose of buzzing bass guitar and multicolored synth, mingled in over the epic stretches of guitar, symphonic strings, and some piano buildups that add a melancholy edge to all the angular rock'n'roll stuff.<br /><br />And Bellamy sticks to the tried-and-true messages in his songwriting -- the world is in turmoil (\\"And these wars; they can never be won/does anyone know or care how they've begun?\\"), governments are rotten and the world is a mess, so get off your butt and act. Much of the time, he sounds like he's standing on a cliff raging against a storm.<br /><br />As much as it pains me to say it, \\"The Resistance\\" failed to grasp my mind and heart like the previous Muse albums. It has some moments of pure brilliance and rock'n'roll beauty, but it also has some moments of colorful awkwardness.st few songs of \\"The Resistance\\" are rather awkward, with lots of fuzzy hard-rock, buzzing bass and a glitzy synth sound -- and some like \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" is the stuff of art-rock nightmares.

B000002UAX|5.0|First off, it's necessary, or at least much better, to at least listen to a side at a time like the pre-historic days of 33 1/3 long players with turntables and large, black, bulky records and no remote controls. This is not an album to choose favorites and put them on your I-Pod.     I have initially purchased this album as well as Abbey Road and Past Masters as well, to get some old and new mixed together.    The White Album has blown me away. Of course, if you're listening to it through $9.99 earbuds on compressed mp3 files, you're probably not going to hear any difference. Even if you're listening through a home \\"stereo\\" system worth a few hundred bucks, you probably won't hear much difference. But, if you have the opportunity to hear this on a decent system, and you are familiar with the album, you'll hear things you haven't heard in forty years of listening to it.    I've especially noticed how easy it is to tell Lennon's and McCartney's voices apart. Lennon's voice on Bungalo Bill \\"all the people sing\\" is amazingly detailed. And, overall, the drums sound more defined. And, the horns no longer sound like kazoos..... With the proper equipment.
B002NXPTDK|4.0|Although I've always respected his obvious creative ability, I've never gotten into Kanye West's music due to all of the other b.s. that goes along with Kanye. This led me to be a little apprehensive about diving into this release by Kid Cudi. But let me tell you right now: don't make the same mistake that I made. This album is easily as rewarding as anything I've heard from Kanye, but without all of the melodrama and self-promotion. Sparse, compelling, a bit dark, and forward thinking... a memorable Hip Hop album, for sure.
0385504225|3.0|When I bought this book I wasn't expecting great literature but I was hoping for something more than a Da Vinci Code retread.  The set-up is almost exactly the same, and while there isn't a one-to-one correspondence between the characters in the last book and this, there certainly is congruency.  So that was vaguely disappointing.    Of course, what we all really came for was the art & architecture, the symbols, the history, etc., and that's all here and as fun as ever.  And there's science in this one that certainly gives you something to think about (though I'm not too sure the proof for that science is quite the slam-dunk Brown thinks it is).    So for me, it's a mixed bag -- and a mixed review.  I think it's too much like its predecessor, but at least, if he's going to be formulaic about it, he has a good formula.  Borrow, don't buy on this one.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I was unsure that it would be possible to top the second season with the whole Lila and Doaks thing, but boy the writers of this show are amazing.  I enjoyed the characters evolving and growing and seeing what they are going to do next. The new adventures and chapters that these folks go through was fresh and new.  Ahh, Jimmy Smits, what a great,deceitful and complex monster, even though you hate him you love him and at least for me I wanted him to be turned loose on the world.  Too bad he didn't know how to play nice with Dexter.  Ohh, and Rita, really are they having a baby?!  The Third season is just fantastic and it didnt let me down one bit.  Waiting for the fourth season.
B000002J1S|4.0|4 1/2    Few, few recordings (especially doubles) sound as good, for long, as this-one of rock's most haunted conceptual masterpieces- possessing enough pockets of perfection to often come out on top in their spectacular first-half discography amongst fans.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I think it would be more helpful for potential buyers to compare the various incarnations of Beatle material out there so that buyers can make an informed decision about what is right for them. There really is not a definitive package of Beatle recordings. Each has it's own magic and benefits and you just need to figure out what you are after.     As for me, so you know, my background is a musician and recording studio owner with 32 years of experience. As for my perspective in comparing Beatle recordings, I've owned the entire Beatles catalog, both American and British versions, in multiple and various pressings on vinyl LP, as well as many unique foreign pressings, cassette and some 8-tracks. I currently have the 1980's box, the Capitol box sets, the Apple remastered stereo box and the Apple remastered mono box and I've been listening to them all side-by-side for this review.     I think buyers of these discs may fall into a few key categories:   1. Long-time Beatle fans who had the original LPs   2. Audiophiles who are looking for the most pristine audible version   3. Young/new fans who just want a nice copy of everything     In short, I'd recommend the following for the respective categories:   1. Apple remastered mono box or Capitol box set, rounded out with individual missing discs   2. Apple remastered stereo box   3. The previously-available 1980's box set     Here's why:     For category 1, the remastered mono box set (or the Capitol box sets, which are stereo and mono) may be the way to go, then just round it out with the individual copies of the missing discs. The mono box has much better sound, clearer than ever before, but still reminiscent of the original LPs tonality and far superior packaging. The mono remasters mimick the original LP packaging even down to spine text and the printed paper inner sleeves! Each disc in the mono set has a resealable outer plastic sleeve (Japanese style) and a plastic inner sleeve to protect the actual disc. The box itself affords direct access to any CD without disturbing the others and the overall box is about the size of CDs, so it fits nicely on a CD shelf (albeit a slightly taller CD shelf; e.g. CD/DVD shelf).     The remastered stereo box is a terrible package. It's 12\\" high and vertical, doesn't fit on the shelf with other CDs/DVDs. You can't access any CD individually. Instead you have to lift this cloth strap to pull an entire stack of CDs out to get to the one you want, frequently spilling the others everywhere like a deck of cards. You are forced to grab the disc surface to get it out of the cardboard sleeve it's in. Only the front cover reproduces the original artwork. Everything else, back, inside and booklet, while it's nice that there are new, never-before seen photos, makes it hard to reminisce if you remember the original LPs. But for audiophiles and new fans, this packaging might be fine, or even preferred.     The remastered mono CDs only have the original liner notes on the back cover, as they were on the LPs, but this is difficult if not impossible to read. The mono set also lacks the album recording notes that the stereo box has. Only notes for the past masters discs seems to be included in the mono set. The benefit of the remastered stereo CD packaging is that the original liner notes are printed in a booklet for each disc, so they are easy to read.     Unlike the mono remasters, the stereo CDs themselves have significantly different sound from the original LPs. Whether you consider it better is subjective depending on your listening goals. For example, Please Please Me (and all other discs that Paul Hicks remastered) seem to be bass-heavy compared to the original LPs and CD sets. While it's quite an improvement that you can now hear the bass lines clearly and the balance seems more up to date with modern recordings, it just won't be as familiar to those who owned all the original albums. Additionally, the beautiful reverb tails that were on the original Please Please Me album seem to decay quicker on the remaster. (Possibly due to various limiting/compression/eq artifacts?) The mono remaster of Please Please Me seems to suffer this same way.  The reverb tails are slightly shorter than previous CD editions like the Capitol box or 1980's Apple box.    The mono set, being mono, all musical elements have to fight for audibility in the center, so, for example, you won't be able to focus on a particular instrument all the way through as easily.  The real benefit of the remastered stereo box sound is that you can now clearly hear many of the little things that were previously buried in the mix. It is beautiful and incredible sounding. The various layers of overdubbed parts across the entire box set are clearly audible, which is a treat to hear clearly for the first time.     There are a very few cases, however, where this isn't true. One very small example is on Don't Bother Me. Early in the song George can be heard saying \\"Fast\\" on the backing track, but only on the Capitol box set stereo version is this completely and clearly audible with the level of detail other tracks in the Apple stereo box have. This gets back to my point that there really isn't one definitive set. Details come out differently in different versions. There are also some strange artifacts of this latest stereo remaster. For example, on Maxwell's Silver Hammer, the lead vocal occasionally seems to shift between being perfectly centered to splitting into a duophonic kind of sound from both the left and right. None of my other copies exhibit this characteristic. I believe this may be caused by phase artifacts introduced in the remastering from the heavy processing required to being out all the details. I also noticed that on some songs the lead vocals actually were quieter than on other available CD editions, possibly caused by the same.     The short movies included on the stereo remaster CDs and the DVD are sometimes interesting, but not great. There area few comments buried in there that I had never heard before, but there are also strange inaccuracies; like seeing stills from Paperback Writer/Rain promo films during the Rubber Soul segment. In general, the movies are only a bonus for Beatle completists, due to a couple details that are revealed. They aren't terribly enlightening otherwise.      While the mono set lacks the videos, the bonus of the mono set is the complete original cover art (front, back and inside, where applicable) as well as all the original inserts, e.g. the 4 individual photos from the white album and the original green cut-out card in Sgt. Pepper, not to mention the groovy rose-to-pink paper inner sleeve, etc.    These sets are a bit overpriced. If the stereo set had the mono packaging, then it would be worth the price. The mono box really should be reduced to the price of the stereo set or less, particularly since it's no longer a limited edition (or at least the edition has been expanded such that it's not as much of a rarity now) and it doesn't have all the music or extras (no booklet for each album, no movies).     The terrible packaging, the overpriced price tag and significant deviation from the original sound (in general) knocks the remastered stereo box down to 3 stars for me. (Yes hearing all the little details is great for me as a fan, but the tonal balance was compromised notably to get that, and that is not how these albums were originally mastered nor intended to sound by George Martin and the band themselves. I think these details could have been brought out reasonably without changing the sound as much as they have.) Because of the cost and significant differences from the original cover art and sound, I can't consider the stereo remaster a 'definitive' set, but rather a supplement to the others sets that are available.      The mono remaster box however, I give 5 stars for having pristine sound without sacrificing the original tonality of these legendary recordings, having the original LP packaging and inserts, much better protection of the discs and sleeves, as well as sized to fit on a CD/DVD shelf.    In summary:     If you are a long-time fan who wants to reminisce and re-experience the original LPs, I would suggest either the new Apple remastered mono box set or Capitol box sets, then round it out by buying any individual stereo discs that are missing (Abbey Road, Let It Be, etc.).     For the new fan who wants a copy of everything but isn't nit picking over whether they can hear John say, \\"Cranberry Sauce\\" on Strawberry Fields or whether everything is in mono or stereo, the previous 1980's box set would be just fine. You might even find it used/cheap on an auction site, now that these remastered boxes are available.  For what it's worth, the previous 1980's box set actually does sound like the original LPs.  It's just that people are listening to them on modern equipment.  Those mixes were originally created for equipment with tube amplifiers and real wood speaker cabinets, which impart a great deal of bass and warmth to the sound.  Putting the same mix through printed circuit board stereos with modern plastic little speakers doesn't quite work with the music to produce the intended result.    For the audiophile who must hear the creaking chair on the final chord of Sgt. Pepper in stereo, the newly-remastered stereo box would be the way to go. The remastered stereo set is also good for anyone who wants to read the original liner notes from the albums and learn more about how the albums were originally recorded.     For the Beatle-completist who must have a every version of a Beatle recording, I'm assuming you already own the 1980's box, the Capitol boxes, the Apple-remastered stereo and the mono box sets prior to reading this review, and there is no review that would help you, since a Beatle purchase is compulsory.

B002JM1VJG|4.0|I have enjoyed your music and stage shows from the very beginning in the early 1980's.    But Madonna, we NEED you to PLEASE release this \\"Celebration: The Video Collection\\" on Blu-ray. Would also like to see \\"The Virgin Tour\\" & \\"Blonde Ambition Tour\\" with remastered picture and sound released on Blu-ray also. My VHS tape of \\"The Virgin Tour\\" wore out years ago. Madonna, I just turned 50 this year and have waited years for these titles to be released. I don't want to be over 60 before I see these titles on DVD. Luckily, I transferred \\"The Virgin Tour\\" to DVD, but it's just not the same as an official release.     Thank you for all these years of great entertainment and great music!
0765350386|4.0|The fantasy world is so interesting, and pretty unique compared to some other mainstream fantasy series. The quality of the writing is really good, and the characters are strong. This book won't disappoint, and neither would another of Sanderson's books \\"Elantris\\". I'm glad this guy was chosen to finish off the Wheel of Time series.

0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown has done it again.  And I mean really done it.  The Lost Symbol has received huge amounts of publicity and has been highly promoted, largely due to the overwhelming success of The Da Vinci Code, and the surrounding controversy.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol promises to be no different.  It's already sold over a million copies, and that's just on its first day of sales!<br /><br />At the very front of the book, just before the Prologue begins, Dan Brown makes a statement very similar to the one found in The Da Vinci Code.  He says that there is a cryptic document locked away in the personal safe of the director of the CIA tat has Masonic implications.  Is this true?  Hard to tell.  Brown also states that all organizations mentioned in this novel exist, as well as all rituals, science, art and monuments.  Ok, easy enough to verify.<br /><br />But what he doesn't say is crucial:  This is a fictional story.  While the setting and locale are based in reality, the simple truth is this:  This story is just that, a story.  It is fiction.  It is the product of Dan Brown's (very creative) imagination.  Just like The Da Vinci Code.  But so many people read his fiction, and are convinced that it is real.  We need to wake up and take a look around us.  We need to stop accepting the truth of a statement, simply because it is in print.<br /><br />The story itself is gripping, though.  I have to admit, I've read all of Dan Brown's novels.  He is a very talented author.  He spins a tale full if intrigue and suspense.  I had a hard time putting down The Lost Symbol, or any of his other works.  The story is well written.  Brown has achieved literary excellence, in that regard at least.<br /><br />However, his fiction contains highly inflammatory and controversial elements.  If you remember that these are simply part of the plot of the fictional story, you're ok.  But if you start to believe that these statements are true glimpses of a dark and hidden reality, you've stepped out of the world the rest of us live in and entered Dan Brown's fictional realm.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol contains several of these un-truths.  And I'm convinced that these reflect the author's own opinions, since they can be found to varying degrees in most of his other books as well.<br /><br />Some of these frightening deceits include:  We have the potential to become gods.  We have the capacity with our own minds to harness the cosmic power of the universe and make our own reality, and hence or own morality.  Jesus was nothing more than a man who had harnessed the full power of his mind.  And all world religions essentially speak the same truth:  that we make our own destiny, and once we reach enlightenment, we become gods.<br /><br />Brown claims that the Freemasons are the protectorates of these frightening \\"truths\\" and will one day allow them to be revealed to the world, which will cause the Apocalypse (which he defines as \\"unveiling\\" or \\"revealing\\") and usher us into a new age of Enlightenment.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is frightening at best.  Downright terrifying at worst.<br /><br />Not because of what he claims is in the near future for humankind.  But because of the twisted web of deceit that he has spun.  And the fact that so many people are going to buy into this as truth.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is full of twisted lies and untruths.  I lost count of how many times he \\"quoted\\" Scripture, only to look up those passages for myself and see how he had twisted the words around to say something completely different than what was there.<br /><br />And if he misquoted and misrepresented the Bible, which I know and trust intimately and implicitly, I can only guess that he misquoted and misrepresented the texts of other major world religions (not that they are true anyway...).<br /><br />Dan Brown has effectively removed God from his throne and set ourselves up in His place.  He leads us to conclude that we don't need God, because, we are, in fact, God ourselves.<br /><br />This is blatantly the opposite of biblical reality.  And we have been faced with this temptation since the very beginning of time, in the Garden of Eden.  Adam and Eve ate of the Tree of Knowledge, being told by the deceiver that \\"in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil\\" (Genesis 3:5).<br /><br />We have been faced with the temptation to become \\"like God\\" ever since.  Mankind has struggled to lift ourselves up and take the place of our Creator ever since that fateful day in the Garden.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol takes us right down that same unfortunate road.  And instead of helping us to draw closer to God and become more like Him, Dan Brown has taught us (once again, like so many other examples in human history) to draw away from God, dethrone Him, and become Him.<br /><br />As I finished reading The Lost Symbol, I was almost physically sick; distraught over the fact that so many people will be led further astray by this hugely over-popular author.  Dan Brown has displayed the capability to sway the opinions (or solidify the defiance) of millions of people with The Lost Symbol.  And he has the potential to destroy the faith of countless people who don't know the truth of God's Word very well.  God's Word says that Dan Brown will one day be held accountable for the false teachings he has propagated within his stories.  My prayer is that he leaves this path that he is on, and turns in a new direction, one that leads him closer to the ultimate Storyteller.<br /><br />Lord, help us to speak Your Truth to a lost and confused world.  Lord, help us to the Your Word for what it is, Your love letter to us, sharing your desire to save us and bring us into a right relationship with You.<br /><br />Lord, help us to seek You, and not seek to become You.ion since the very beginning of time, in the Garden of Eden.

B002BE7JE8|5.0|CHILD'S PLAY is simply one of the most effective horror films released in the 80's.<br />It benefits from a solid screenplay, a great cast, a great director and special effects that are a wow! Before CHILD'S PLAY, director Tom Holland gave us another 80's classic [[ASIN:0767817664 FRIGHT NIGHT]] and I must say this was a director in the top of his game.<br /><br />Little Vincent (Andy Barclay) lives with his single mom (Catherine Hicks) who works hard to make ends meet. He is sad because he wants for his birthday a Good Guy doll (a doll after a popular TV show). The dolls are great: they talk, each one has its own name... and they are very expensive. But mom (knowing her son is sad) finds a street seller who happens to have a Good Guy doll for sale - a doll he stole from a toy store where something horrible happened...<br /><br />...And this is just the beginning because inside the doll is the spirit of a murderer (Brad Dourif) who managed to transfer his soul to the doll before getting shot by Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon). So the doll will kill his way to Norris in search of revenge.<br /><br />This is an amazing film in every way. So good it turned out becoming a franchise. But in my opinion, none of the sequels matched this first film for all its qualities.<br /><br />Plus: finally we get all the extras we deserve.<br /><br />Recommended.
B002GZQYMK|3.0|I have been a Muse fan for a while, and was looking forward to this CD after having been disappointed with about half of the Black Holes and Revelations CD.  Unfortunately, this CD just doesn't cut it compared to Absolution or Origin of Symmetry.  I bascially enjoyed the last half of the CD, with MK Ultra being the only track that I am really excited about.  I also enjoyed I Belong to You and the Symphony, but the rest of the CD has too many \\"What were they thinking?\\" moments to stand up to their best work.  If you took half of Black Holes and half of the Resistance, you would have one classic Muse CD.  Here would be my song line-up:    MK Ultra  Assassin  Exo-Politics  Hoodoo  Map of the Ploblematique  I Belong to You  Exogenesis Part 1  Exogenesis Part 2  Exogenesis Part 3  Unnatural Selection  Starlight  City of Delusion  Knights of Cydonia  Soldier's Poem
B000067J24|1.0|This disaster does not deserve even 1 star. Horrible acting - especially the husband/boyfriend seem to read their lines from a teleprompter. Screenplay is dumb and boring. The scene were half of the cities male population follows in P. Cruz fotsteps is ridiculous. Half way thru I thought this can't get any worse, guess what - IT DID! An insult to intelligent movie goers. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. Maybe eye candy for the guys - Penelope C. is beautiful, an actress she is not. r,
0385504225|1.0|I was looking forward to this new book, but I must confess I have rarely been this disappointed. This book is incredibly slow and overly complicated. It is like a flight that never takes off. It is not worth the money. There are thousands of other books that are signficiantly better. Pardon me, but I do not understand the hype!
B00006JDVV|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I like the action and the special effects.  Actors are ok.
0451169514|4.0|It is the first Stephen King novel I have read. I was not scared by the length, as I have read Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. Anyways, this novel is a great read, as It is different for everybody, and thus people will be scared and see It as their worst fear. I won't ruin the book if you want to read it (pun intended), so just go out and buy it. I took about a week reading It, but I was hurrying and it was so engrossing I found myself reading for hours late into the night.     Overall, an amazing book. Read It.
B001TODCII|5.0|This is a great action movie that we all enjoy.  I also like it because it has a good ending. Fast delivery too!!!!
B000PMGNK4|4.0|I liked solid state society, and I think that if you like the stand alone complex series, you will like solid state society as well.  It is more like the 2nd gig than the original stand alone complex series.  The quality is great.  It is rather convoluded though, as ghost in the shell can be at times, but I would say its no more complex than 2nd gig was, and for the most part, it is an interesting cyberpunk action movie.  I strongly recommend getting the soundtrack.  It comes with the steel book edition (only $1 more on amazon when I bought it).  Yoko Kanno's music is absolutely fantastic.  This soundtrack is much more in the classical genre, but there are also some good techno/pop tracks.

0307266303|5.0|McDougall's book is a quick, engaging read. His suppositions about being barefoot typically reflect the evidence presented in scientific literature regarding participating in activities barefoot, though I think at times McDougall borders on blind zeal. That being said, most of us could benefit from stronger feet and better form while running. In fact, the book inspired me to experiment with going barefoot myself; currently I am running entirely barefoot two days a week and incorporating shoes that mimic barefoot running into my longer runs. The book also reignited my passion for ultra running. I am currently training for a 50 miler and a 50K. What more can you ask of a read?
0385504225|1.0|I've read The Da Vinci code. It's brilliant, amazing plot and a great ending. But this book goes from \\"ok\\" to \\"really bad\\" in no time and is tedious to flip through. As a Dan Brown fan, I'd say this book is \\"same old candy in a new wrapper\\" but leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth. Sad. I knew it would be nearly impossible to top Da Vinci code, but this turned out to be the worst of his books.     # Spoilers Ahead #    The lost symbol is about a lunatic's dream to become god. This lunatic is really wealthy, has a loving family, all the comforts you could imagine. But he's a ... lunatic.    Lunatic loses his mind thanks to drugs, watches a documentary on freemasons, gets every mm of his body tattoed, becomes invincible thanks to tons of steroids which actually seem to make him superhuman, but wait, there's more... he wants to be god. So lunatic decides to go after  his family to get hold of the legendary pyramid, kills people, cuts hands of people, oh and kills birds, rats, rodents and performs all sorts of evil sacrifices. In the middle of all this melee, a group of people must protect the lost symbol, no wait.. it's the lost word... no, no, the lost mind, the lost language, oh wait.. it's actually a book = The Bible !!! You got that right ! And the CIA has a job too... To prevent the lunatic from uploading a video to YouTube or whatever.    Lunatic finally gets the pyramid and tells dad to kill him with a $1.6 million knife.. Alas, knife breaks into two but lunatic has his wish fulfilled anyways.    So you're thinking, what's the moral of the story..... Easy, Say No To Drugs. Don't get me wrong, this is a page turner... the first few hundred pages have exciting moments but as the story nears the end it becomes a drag.... and the biggest letdown is the secret that was being protected for which so many people had to die. Turns out we can channel our mind to reach unimaginable potentials... and other philosophical mumbo jumbo. That's it, that's the secret. THE SECRET, was a much better book than this. It actually tells you how to channel your mind properly.     But this book is a waste of time.  The climax made me want to tear apart my hair, but it's too precious a thing to lose. Maybe if the secret was a hair growing cream, wouldn't that be something?
0765317389|2.0|I received this book as a gift from a very well-read friend who shares very similar interests as me. I was advised this book was one of the best novels ever written. Unfortunately I received terrible advice.    This book follows the tales of Ender Wiggin. A product of a government that intends to breed military geniuses. Ender is definitely a genius, but that's about all he is. Every character is essentially the same and do not change throughout the entire book. Ender is criticized for being a \\"third\\" (third born child) and faces many obstacles throughout the novel in \\"battle school.\\"    In most sci-fi/fantasy writing a book is believable in its own world. It can be completely unbelievable in the sense of our world, but at least in its own world it makes sense and fits. This book is NOT believable in its world and does not make sense. Card does a terrible job making anyone believe that a small child thinks the way Ender or either of his siblings do.    This book is hardly sci-fi. It's not until very late in the book that you learn anything about the \\"buggers\\" or get any description of anything outside of Earth and battle school.    On the plus side, the overall plot is decent (hence it receiving 2 instead of 1 star) and Card does a decent job of building a lot of suspense and tension.    Overall, this book is no more than a 2/5 stars. I can't possibly see how this is the best novel ever written or even close to anything above 2 stars. Do yourself a favor and read an Arthur Clarke book.
B00006L85B|5.0|I love this album. I am so grateful for being able to buy it through Amazon. The seller sent this very quickly and I have   ejoyed listening to it for many hours. I'm still trying to learn the lyrics.  It also came with a bonus DVD which I have not viewed yet.   I hope I can find similar Luis Miguel albums. If you like Spanish ballads, this is a great album.
0385504225|3.0|As usual Dan Brown takes us on a mythical, historical and a magical journey. From the first chapter to the last, I was glued to the story. The final outcome or the message of the story is believable, and encouraged me to do more research on the subject.    Now, there are lots of flashbacks. When I say 'a lot' ...I mean 'A LOT'. Almost all of the main characters past history are introduced as flashbacks and....I felt it was bit distracting or unnecessary. Other than that, I have no complains.    Still, The Da Vinci Code' is the number one for me. Lost Symbol can be put on #2 ...for now.    Also, the book has only 133 chapters :-) When you finish reading it, you will understand what I mean....
B000GDH9J6|5.0|I found this by chance in a bargain bin somewhere and bought it because I adopted my daughter from China and am always on the lookout for asian films and documentaries.  I have to say - if I'd seen it in the theater and had to pay full price to acquire the DVD, I gladly would have done so.  It's an excellent film and went straight to the shelf with my most prized classic movies.  From a cinematography standpoint, it's a masterpiece of storytelling through use of wide shots.  Like other films in which the environment is so overwhelming that it becomes a character in the story, these stark mountain plains quickly move from geographical backdrop to a shifting role as ally/antagonist.  The plot is suspenseful and the acting superb.  Because of the violence of the storyline, I can't show it to either my young daughter or my middle school film class although I'll probably show a clip the next time I do a unit on cinematography because it's just so well executed.  In the meantime I'm happy to shelve it for myself and look forward to the day when I can screen it for friends, lend it to a another film buff, or rewatch it.
B002GZQYMK|3.0|The Resistance is my introduction to Muse. After hearing several people talk about them recently, and reading the seemingly glowing reviews of this album, I decided to give them a shot. At first, I couldn't enjoy it. Even a hardcore Muse fan would have to agree that many (if not most) of the lyrics are downright embarrassing. Particularly on tracks \\"Resistance\\" and \\"Undisclosed Desires\\". I am actually ashamed to play the album around other people because the lyrics are so silly. That's not to say that these songs aren't enjoyable. Muse is technically very talented, and they have quite a skill for creating catchy tracks. Most of the songs on the album have been stuck in my head at one time or another over the past week. But catchiness doesn't necessarily make for intellectually stimulating music, and I really wish Muse had focused more on subtle, meaningful lyrics, rather than garbage like \\"I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart\\". Gag me.    Still, The Resistance definitely has an audience, and there is a good chance you will find something to like about it even if you have to shut off your mind a little bit. I don't regret buying it, but I am also definitely not confident recommending it to people.
B00005MP58|1.0|I've received this DVD for Christmas almost 2 years ago and I was so disappointed with the picture quality. Mine is all dark and the details of the costumes and furniture doesn't show.<br />Before, I kept rending the DVD from Netflix and their disks were so nice (it wasn't the special edition though but the regular DVD which they have stoped selling by now). So I was used to seeing the nice detials, colors.<br />Today, I've broke down and purchased a used copy of this older-version DVD from Amazon marketplace. I hope and pray that copy will have a nice picture quality because the movie is 5 stars otherwise and have watched it countless times!<br />Good luck with your copy.
B000784WMW|5.0|This version is by far the most accurate to the beloved book (which I have read 7 times) Although there are a few differences it is all around very accurate and I love the acting on both parts. This is a great buy and I highly suggest purchasing it!
B001XJEKGC|2.0|[[ASIN:B001XJEKGC Live from Madison Square Garden]]<br /><br />I really looked forward to owning this DVD... but in one word the quality of the sound STINKS! What a pity, concerts from the eighties sound better than this. HEY AMAZON - can I return this?
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Despite reports to the contrary, the DVD is wonderful.<br />First, as to the technical quibbles - it's all about the music and the performance - be glad it was captured! The picture and sound on my copy is GREAT. Watched on my 40\\" LG plasma and on my 23\\" PC monitor. The video in 4:3 480P is excellent for capturing a live performance in a low-key theater lighting situation.  The audio is clean, sharp and full range. The DVD experience is much more than the \\"just music\\" CD version some technophile has recommended. I find nothing negative about the technical quality. Enjoy the show.<br /><br />Musically and performance-wize, this is one of the all-time great shows to see. Cohen's troupe of amazingly multi-talented and versatile musicians is a joy to witness.<br /><br />Leonard is in his 75th year and is the master of his game. He touches all your emotions in a deep and complex way. This is a good DVD to watch with your sweetie along with some wine in a private location. Loaf of bread optional.<br /><br />For vocals Leonard is supported by long-time collaborator and songwriter Sharon Robinson, and the wonderfully pure harmonies of the Webb sisters Charley and Hattie. Band members  Roscoe Beck (the musical director and Bassist) and Dino Soldo (winds & keyboard) also add to the harmonies. In the final hymn, everyone sings.<br /><br />The musicians seem eclectic at first glance yet blend wonderfully. Cohen's music might suggest the very late night smoky atmosphere of a jazz club. The wide variety of musical traditions represented by the troupe, rather than conflicting with that atmosphere, bring it to a high level. The are all clearly deeply talented. One can sense that individually they could dazzle you with expertise in widely varying traditions but in this ensemble they have chosen to blend beautifully and masterfully in an understated way. At every point they are unforced, comfortable, deep, and delicious. If you are a musician of any of any caliber you will be in appreciative awe.<br /><br />I'd go on and on praising each member, but better than that, just buy the damn DVD, grab your personal thou, and settle in for a great treat. Later, send Leonard a thank-you note.

1416583408|2.0|I expected to love this book. Unfortunately, it leaves a lot to be desired.    First, there is surprisingly little information in it. The author touches on each subject so briefly that only the most superficial observations can be made. Dog body language gets maybe two pages and includes such revelations as the meaning of a tucked tailed (discomfort and/or submission). Is there a dog owner in the world who doesn't already know that? Note: if that's new to you and you own a dog, stop reading this review and find a dog trainer immediately. In the 250 pages I managed to read, I found two things of interest: the description of canine vision, and speculation on a potential flaw in experiments on dog intelligence (to wit: dogs know that humans are great providers of food, so if a dog that gives up on the puzzle in front of him and runs over to the researcher for help, maybe he's being smart, not dumb).     Second, the author spends way too much time bemoaning human chauvinism. Apparently, all research into animal behavior is done to shore up our belief that humans are the rightful masters of the earth.     Third, the tone of this book is insistently, forcibly whimsical. Sometimes it hits the right note, and I did find myself laughing out lot a few times, particularly at an anecdote about a doberman put to work guarding a collection of valuable teddy bears. Unfortunately, it's more often grating, and I found myself rolling my eyes at the little vignettes about the author's dog that start every chapter. It truly pains me to write that, as love between a dog and an owner is such a wonderful thing.     Fourth, the text has some odd contradictions, one which is noted by the reviewer below me. The author also starts one chapter raving about dogs' almost preternatural ability to understand our intentions -- and supports this assertion by noting how easy it is to fool a dog into thinking you've thrown a tennis ball.    Finally, I came to the point where I had to put the book down. The author begins to describe dogs' sense of personal space, which she gets almost entirely wrong. She makes a common mistake in saying that dogs have a much smaller radius of personal space than we do. This may be true of ultra-friendly, well-socialized dogs like many retrievers, but it is *not* the norm. Dogs are in fact extremely concerned with personal space, and much of what we know about their communication involves conveying the boundaries of their \\"bubbles\\".    The final straw was here: \\"Repeating itself on sidewalks across the country is a scene that demonstrates the clash of our sense of personal space: the sight of two dog owners as they stand six feet apart, straining to keep their leashed dogs from touching, while the dogs strain mightily to touch each other. Let them touch!\\" This is horribly bad advice. There are a thousand reasons why two strange dogs should not be allowed to greet each other unrestrainedly, first and foremost that lunging towards another dog is actually very aggressive behavior. Dogs have a plethora of signals indicating that their interest is respectful, including look aways, medium-to-low tail carriage, and a sideways approach. A dog that jumps straight up into another dog's business is socially inept at best, and intending harm at worst.    Instead of this book, I would recommend almost anything by Temple Grandin (who isn't always right either, but has a fascinating perspective), Turid Rugaas, Karen Pryor, or Brenda Aloff.
B000001FT0|5.0|I've loved Steve Winwood for years and go back and forth between listening to his various albums (sometimes, this one, other times Arc of a Diver, etc.). I always listen to full albums, not just singles, but the one exception is the song 'And I Go'. I can listen to this over and over again. It's such a romantic song and he sounds perfect on this - instrumentally and vocally. I love Winwood.
B0000029LG|5.0|CD is absolutely exquisite!!! Stranger in Moscow is a beautiful ballad; Earth Song, phenomenal; History is a real piece of work, sounds more like an anthem but beautiful nonetheless, makes me cry; Scream, just awesome., lyrics well written.  Yes he does exhibit anger in some of his songs and rightfully so. The media was unrelenting and never fair in portraying the man for whom he really was, an unprecedented, gifted genius. very loving and just wanted to be loved. This Cd is awesome, the man is awesome. I love him, always will.... The world has loss a true genius but his legacy will undoubtedly live for ever. I recommend this CD whether or not you are an MJ fan, if you're not, you will become one. 5 stars all the way......

1601251505|5.0|While any RPG is going to be far from perfect, this is a much better version of What an RPG should be; not some system playing in the world of Nintendo and being just a mechanism to sell books and suplements.  With my first supplement purchase for Pathfinder, I've already invested more in Pathfinder than I ever will for D&D 4.<br /><br />If Hasbro wants me and my crew back as customers they would do wise to fire the persons responsible for designing a pen and paper rpg based on the world of video gaming, and begin work immediately on putting a 5th edition out.  With Pathfinder being such a superior project, Paizo just may become the minnow that swallows the whale.
B00142X56Y|5.0|This is the first opera I have ever listened to in it's entirety. Have never been a fan. But I happened to get the Opus Arte sampler and heard the selection from the Queen of the Night and was so moved I bought the blu-ray version of the entire opera. I am not disappointed. I love all the singing, the set and staging. The sound quality, which got me here in the first place, is stunning. Bluray is the newest hi-res reference sound and will hopefully accomplish what SACD and DVD-Audio didn't; mass market education and demand for hi-res, video and audio. I am looking froward to sharing with my daughters, 8 & 12. We'll see. Kudos to all involved.

I had high anticipation and when I finally got it I could not put it down.   The story is about how the joker is trying to prove one thing, and he wants to prove it on Batman's greatest ally, Commissioner Gordon. What he is trying to prove is that one bad day can turn even someone so great into him, that everyone has a breaking point. This is a true legend. It is worth the money for something this great.

B00288KNJU|4.0|Coraline tells the story of a young girl who moves into a country house with her parents and finds a doorway into another universe.  This other place has a house similar to her real one and a mother/father that look like her real parents, but things aren't quite right; the house is too beautiful and perfect, the \\"parents\\" are too loving, and all the people in this world have buttons instead of eyes.  Her new \\"other mother\\" wants her to stay in this perfect world forever.  Then things get spooky.    I haven't read the book by Neil Gaiman, who's a terrific author, but I thoroughly enjoyed this creepy movie.  The portrayal of the \\"other place\\" is just right: at first it looks beautiful and enchanting, but things just start getting a little wrong and wronger.  The other tenants (the country house is split into apartments) are terrific characters; the theater performance of the old ladies in the basement is a scream.    The movie was done in 3D stop-motion animation, and it's the best I've seen.  The settings are so colorful and imaginative that for a while I thought it was computer-generated animation designed to LOOK like stop-motion.  The blu-ray includes both a 2D and 3D version (with the 3D glasses), but I haven't looked at the 3D yet.  Home theaters can't replicate the same 3D technology used in theaters so instead they do the ol' red/green glasses thing.  This REALLY screws up the colors which would be a shame in this very colorful movie.  In watching it in 2D, there are clearly elements that were added for an in-your-face 3D effect, but you don't really need it or miss it.    Critics have said this movie is too scarey for children.  What do I care, I'm 54.  People are always underestimating children's ability to process scarey fantasy anyway.  I KNOW that when I was a kid, this movie would have scared the daylights out of me and I'd have loved it.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Great story, great characters, great direction. Jane Austen produced so many high quality works it is difficult to choose just one, but \\"Persuasion\\"is high ranking.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This just HAS to be the most underrated movie of 2007 (although I noticed it DID make many reviewers end-of-the-year Top 10 list).  The movie is based on a Neil Gaiman novel, so it's typically wildy creative.  It follows the story of Tristran Thorn, who lives in the rural England town of Wall.  Wall has a wall on one side that separates it from the magical kingdom of Stormhold (in the land of Faerie, although I don't think the movie uses that word).  At the bequest of his \\"true love\\", Tristran crosses the wall to retrieve a fallen star; however when Tristran gets to the star he finds out it is a beautiful young woman who was knocked out of the sky by a flying gemstone on a necklace.  Meanwhile, also searching for the star are the surviving sons of the old King (because the owner of the gemstone inherits Stormhold) and the Queen of the Witches (because the heart of a star confers youth and long life - when eaten).<br /><br />This makes for a pretty exciting action film, a cross between an adventure fantasy and a romance.  I've seen it compared to Princess Bride but I don't agree.  Princess Bride is a comedy, and it's really a PARODY of the fantasy genre more than actually BEING a fantasy.  This movie really IS a fantasy and is NOT a comedy (although it certainly has some humor in it).  Not to mention this movie is FAR better than Princess Bride. The acting is across the board excellent; Michelle Pfeiffer is gorgeous (and also hideous in just the right way), Claire Danes is terrific as the star Yvaine (she has a moderately long soliloquy on the nature of love, which I at least found fairly moving), and Robert DeNiro does an excellent job in possibly the strangest role he's ever performed.  The storyline is excellent, with a terrific climax and a moving ending.<br /><br />The movie is gorgeously done with impressive scenery and visuals, and a really outstanding soundtrack.  Unfortunately, this movie was released fairly lately to Blu-ray and the Blu-ray transfer is acceptable but not particularly outstanding.<br /><br />BTW, I read Neil Gaiman's book AFTER seeing the movie (the text-only book, he also issued it as a graphic novel).  The first part of the movie follows the book faithfully, although the book has more characters and scenes in it.  However, the movie departs quite significantly from the book beginning at the appearance of Robert DeNiro's \\"Captain Shakespeare\\" character (who is not in the book at all).  Somewhat surprisingly, I think the movie's storyline is quite a bit better than the book; it wraps up the story quite nicely whereas the book just sort of gradually drifts to a gentle ending.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I do enjoy the Austen's tales. This is one of the best. The current remakes of Jane Austen works are excellent.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|I enjoyed the DVD Music much better. Just being able to watch their physical, and emotional input with every song they perfomed was a high for me.

B0014L5Z18|5.0|At least for those of us who don't appreciate those thin little twelve-year old girl squeaks Sarah ejects into the air, and prefer a womanly voice.  Way more pleasing to the ear.<br /><br />This album blends a mild metallica sound with an epic, creepy, opera sound.  Nice and moody.  I love it!  I also love those sharp industrial roars, clacks, creaks, and booms used in the background of several tracks here.  The track Ciaren's Well goes a little too into the metallica side for my taste, while You Would Have Loved This and Calling Grace were too slow.  But I would not take a star off for them.  The only track that I really don't like is My Little Pheonix--it emulates Sarah's childish style too much.  I Walk Alone and Poison have a fun, yet haunting, whimsical pop to them. Damned and Divine (Live - Bouns Track) is dark and groovy.  Oasis is downright breathtaking.<br /><br />I'm glad this artist split from that other group.  I listened to them to see what the fuss is about, and found them abrasive and boring.  Her talent was wasted with them.  This though, this is amazing.  I hope her future holds more of this kind of music.
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown's third Robert Langdon book is predictable, in a literary writing sense. The plot, as in most Dan Brown's novels, is twist-turning and shocking.  The story is well-paced and characters are well portrayed, even though most of them are Dan Brown's cliche.  This novel captivated my interest from the first page to the final revelation.      After finishing this novel, I looked on Amazon to see how reviewers rated this book.  I was definitely confused when I saw all the 1 and 2 star reviews. I question the validity of these absurb and unconstructive reviews. Must of these 1-star review claimed that they are avid Dan Brown readers (such as \\"I read all of Dan Brown's books...\\" or \\"Believe me, I am a Dan Brown fan...\\") and naturally, I would assume that they are familiar with Dan Brown's literary style.  Most of these so-called fans criticized Dan Brown's writing style and how it was \\"boring\\" and \\"unnecessarily detailed secondary characters\\".  I admit that Dan Brown borrowed his formulated writing style from his earlier novels, so I can understand how some would deem it \\"repetitve and boring\\".  But wouldn't the so-called fans expect this style of writing from the beginning anyway?  And overly detailed secondary characters is a problem now? I would think that readers would want to care about the characters rather than not caring what would happen to the characters (for example, in The Lost Symobl, I actually cared about Trish even though she contributed little to the ongoing plot).      I even read some reviews saying that this book has no controversy (opposed to The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons)... well, they obviously haven't finished reading the novel.  In my opinion, this book is even more controversial than his earlier novels (I am not going to spill the bean here).   I find The Last Symobl a highly enjoyable read, and it really makes you think about your view on life and the mysterious world.  Again, this book might go aganist some's religious beliefs,but it shouldn't stop you from reading a good fiction book.

B001BJ690Y|5.0|The storyline is rather simple - \\"the Bride\\" is out for revenge against Bill, a former boss and father of her unborn child, and his followers who turned her wedding into a bloodbath, almost killing her. However, Tarantino's style and writing along with a superb performance by Uma Thurman elevate this movie to greatness. There is never a dull moment and the viewer cheers for the Bride, despite the fact she's also an assassin who's out to kill people. Part of that is due to her reason for revenge, and part is due to Tarantino's style which actually makes the movie \\"fun\\" in a way.     By now I think most people are prepared for the amount of violence in Tarantino's films. In this movie he takes advantage of the freedom in an anime-type sequence to have even more blood. The violence in \\"Kill Bill Vol. 1\\" is over-the-top to the point where it's humorous at times.     The performances by all the actors are very good, especially Thurman. While there is plenty of action, there are also a good number of dramatic scenes and it does include some humor. I particularly enjoyed a series of scenes where the Bride was visiting Japan to obtain a special samurai sword which demonstrated a sense of honor. And there was a scene with Lucy Lui's character - also an assassin - in a board room meeting which was hilarious! Overall, I think it's a great action movie and is one of Tarantino's best.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|Hello music lovers,<br /><br />In January 1956, just days after attaining age 21, Elvis Presley invented something that did not exist in the world before: a pop version of a blending of blues, R&B, Gospel, a tinge of C&W to make a new sound that he hoped people would like all over the world.<br /><br />They did. The song was \\"Heartbreak Hotel.\\" He had already lived out the song, as he usually did {excepting those \\"movies\\"}, but it was this new SOUND he was making: it didn't have a name yet, but he knew what he wanted. The record made him a King, but the sound would not have a name for some time.<br /><br />It's called soul: a blend of gospel, blues, R&B, some C&W lyricism that has enough of a \\"pop\\" gloss to it to attract people from all corners of music throughout the world. And ya gotta FEEL it! He struggled for years after leaving the heavy-handed approach of Sun's Sam Phillips to make this ideal sound. That struggle resulted in bunches and bunches of great recordings. But none like this one from his \\"comeback\\" era {'68-'70}: \\"From Elvis in Memphis.\\" The \\"Stranger in {his} Own Hometown\\" returned in January and February of 1969 to take the brilliance of an adolescent genius and transform it into some of the greatest artistic masterpieces in the history of recorded music. By then of course, it had a name. But not this particular voice or creative vision.<br /><br />On \\"From Elvis in Memphis\\" you hear the very sound of what Memphis had to have felt like to Elvis in early 1969. You hear him pick through the ashes of his \\"town\\"'s broken dreams, struggling for hope and rebirth. It amazing: a musical document{ary} of a man, a time, and a once-great city. But it's much more than an documentary: it is the truth that great art reveals. {Yes, of course, the title could have been more creative: how about simply \\"Memphis Dreams\\" with \\"Elvis Presley's\\" in small writing above it. And the original back photograph with the yellow sweater-jacket is definitely NOT indicative of thehistory in these grooves.} Would it have cost RCA Victor back then too much to photograph Elvis on what was left of Beale Street in post-1968 Memphis? Just let him walk, sit, look up, look down, whatever, and with some black&white film, just snap away until they got \\"THE\\" picture to go with the music?<br />Why, of course it would have been too much for them to do for him. But the work is so strong that it actually didn't matter: not in the long run. Sure, perhaps the lame cover art {especially the back!} probably harmed both chart position and any hope of a Grammy nomination or award, but it's been 40 years since that young man walked into that little pink \\"dump\\" of a building and said \\"man, what a funky studio\\"! He loved it.<br />The first song he tore into may have been the best: a not-very-well-known country plaint about a loved one leaving the folks back home for {his} \\"dream\\" in the big city. In a country song, there's gotta be sadness, so the innocent youngster, corrupted by The Big City, comes back later in a hearse. Sounds corny, huh? Well, you'll have to listen, then. Elvis Presley struggles, with brutal honesty, to an extremely powerful full-on southern soul arrangement - but with Chips Moman's perfectionistic care to remove anything non-essential and leave a beautifully doomed and stark ambiance that turns the country weeper into a powerful backdrop for Elvis's unimaginably electrifying vocals. If Elvis Presley had written every word, note, and chord, and had this arrangement {which he helped shape}, it would have been EXACTLY THE SAME.<br /><br />Someone once complained of a book by a thoughtful friend that it did not explain Elvis's \\"politics.\\" Those \\"politics\\" are here on these sessions, which are a coherent statement about \\"dreams turned to ashes and gone\\" {\\"Without Love\\"}, which is so strong it actually carries the morbid, but strangely hopeful spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s final speech the night before his murder not far from where Elvis grew up, and not far from the little pink studio. The speech was given in the old Ellis auditorium, where Elvis used to go to thrill to ecstatic shouts of gospel fervor in the all-night sings there as a teen through his very early 20s. On this masterful work, Elvis looks at his world and his place in it and struggles to pick through those \\"ashes\\" to \\"be a man {and} take a stand\\" {\\"Only the Strong Survive\\"} in search of the \\"better world\\" he sang of in \\"If I Can Dream\\" about six months earlier. By the end of the following year, he gave up, both personally and politically. All he seemed to care about, by then, was scoring dope without getting busted {especially if his one last dream: touring the world, could actually come true -- of course, it did not}.<br /><br />He wasn't the only one: by the early '70s, popular music was slipping into a malaise that would claim both souls and lives. Elvis sang a song about that, too: it was called \\"Where Did They Go, Lord?\\" and was, in his hands, a powerful cry of despair over the loss of youthful idealism and hope. Back in 1956, he was proud to tell a newspaper reporter in New York City that he would be voting {his first time!} for Adlai Stevenson because \\"man, he knows the most\\" although he didn't \\"dig the intellectual bit.\\" The reporter probed a little deeper asked about the draft and its necessity in cold war times. Elvis said the words he would regret 'till the morning of his death: \\"there should be no draft!\\" A little over a year later, he cried in Sun records singer Barbara Pittman's arms after picking up his own draft notice. {It was NOT his idea to pick it up himself: he was told to do so, and realizing there was no way out, anyway, he did. It was a few days before Christmas.} Yeah, Parker saw some publicity potential in the thing, but in truth, he did not want his charge so close to his true homeland in the Netherlands. Parker claimed to have Great Powers with people in Washington, but he was, as one observer astutely putit, like the actor Frank Morgan, who played the powerless little man behind the curtain pretending to be the all-powerful Wizard of Oz. Only difference was that Elvis never quite saw him that way, or felt he WAS trapped. Parker had every little mistake the Presley's had ever made neatly collected and ready for distribution should Elvis ever try to tell him he's through. Elvis and his father were both insecure enough to believe he could destroy them when he could not {he plenty to hide, himself}.<br /><br />Yes, Elvis Presley should have faced his mammoth insecurities and taken complete creative control of his material at this time. I mean COMPLETE, as in sitting in a room and not coming out until he'd written some real songs without any collaboration, and certainly without his defense mechanism of using profanity to kill the release of almost any of his very own feelings in song: the Rolling Stones' first manager locked them in a kitchen and they wrote \\"As Tears Go By\\" -- not their best, but it got them started. It's not rocket science, and Elvis understood songs from the inside out. {He apologized later in '69 to Johnny Tillotson [sp?] for changing some lyrics, which left Tillotson stunned -- at the apology.} If Parker actually had listened to any music after, say, Follies of 1920, he would have known such an action was necessary at this time, but that would be like asking RCA to have taken some real photos for the first great album from these sessions -- and liner notes, too! On this record, it didn't matter. Instead, they paired a second batch of songs {mostly excellent} with a live Vegas album for an appropriately tacky two-fer. Elvis should have been playing Carnegie Hall first.<br /><br />In any case, it's all THAT GOOD. Get out your debit card and buy it!<br />rm
B002BSHWUU|3.0|Day Tripper was always fun to listen to because of the funny little mute for a split second in a couple of instances in the right channel during the course of the song. Why did they get rid of it? Hang on to your old CDs my friends!    As someone else mentioned, hopefully they will release the songs all remixed as they did some ten years ago on Yellow Submarine. The music was truly incredible remixed -- I could definitely here instrumentation that was not [[ASIN:0634010360 The Beatles - Yellow Submarine]] readily apparent in the old mixes.

B000PTYPAC|5.0|First off, let me just say that this is NOT the kind of music I ordinarily listen to. My favorite bands are prog metal bands such as Between the Buried and Me, Dream Theater, Devin Townsend, Opeth, and Periphery.    That being said, (and I almost feel embarrassed saying this, like I'm betraying my musical duty) this is one heck of a great album! The instrumental work is nothing extraordinary, but Hayley Williams' voice is AMAZING, and every single song is extremely catchy. None of this even feels like filler. I feel like the problem with most popular bands these days is A) they are extremely repetitive and all their songs sound about the same, and/or B) their sound is very generic and they aren't unique at all. But Paramore doesn't fall into either of those categories. Their songs have a decent amount of diversity and there is actually some vamping, as opposed to bands where the singer comes in on the first beat on every single song and doesn't stop singing until the 2 and a half minutes is up. But what really makes Paramore stand out and have their own unique, recognizable sound, is Hayley Williams. Her vocal talent is absolutely phenomenal, her voice is very unique, and she comes up with some really great vocal melodies and hooks.    Bottom line, buy this album. Or at least torrent it. Actually, just torrent it. Enough people have bought this already.

0385504225|5.0|I was shocked to see so many negative reviews for this book.  Both the writing and the story are better than Brown's previous attempts, though there are still a few annoying bugs in his style.    I'm extremely pleased that Brown finally learned how to write compound sentences.  His other works are choppy enough to be distracting, but here the narrative flows smoothly, allowing the reader to become truly immersed in the story.    I found \\"The Lost Symbol\\" to be just as much of a page-turner as Brown's previous novels, if not more.  Honestly, I have no idea why so many people had trouble with the pacing.  Yes, he uses an obvious trick - short, punchy chapters with cliffhangers at the end - but it's exactly the same thing he's done in his other works.  Surely we were all expecting that?    As for the subject matter, it felt like a surprising and yet natural progression of the philosophy presented in the first two books.  I actually found it quite inspiring, even - or perhaps especially - as an atheist.  Best of all, the story motivated me to continue my own research on several topics, ranging from science and art to philosophy and religion - and it's certainly decided my next vacation destination for me!    Highly, highly recommended.
0439023483|5.0|I had high hopes for this book after reading the blurb on the back. I was not disappointed. [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] paints a bleak picture of the future, in which citizens live behind barbed wire and are kept on the very edge of starvation. As punishment for a revolt that took place thirty years before, each city is forced to pay 'tribute' in the form of two of their citizens. Each year, on the day of the 'reaping', the citizens of each city are forced to gather and watch as the names of one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen are drawn from barrels. If your name is chosen, you must participate in the 'Hunger Games' - the ultimate reality TV show from which there can be just one survivor.<br /><br />This is the most suspenseful young adult novel I have read in a long time.

I can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy!

This is far from a GREAT film, but it's certainly quite enjoyable and engaging through a combination of believable dialogue, good casting, solid directing, and a well-chosen soundtrack.<br /><br />It covers no new ground---we've all seen this type of \\"1970s-summer-romance/coming-of-age\\" story before, with a healthy dollop of \\"endearing-geek-gets-really-beautiful-girl.\\"  Yet it shows admirable restraint in not going over the top with the geek-chic (unlike \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\") and the characters are both familiar and somewhat original at the same time.  So despite faithfully following certain narrative conventions of this genre, it manages to retain a sufficiently redeeming amount of authenticity and realism.  For instance when the two leads finally get it on, they don't just effortlessly and flawlessly shed their clothes and melt into each other's arms as most films would have it---there is still a lot of tentativeness and awkwardness on both of their parts, and the camera cuts away before the fireworks even really start.<br /><br />And of course the fact that Kristen Stewart, probably thanks to some masterful makeup and lighting and camera angles, looks strangely exquisite here (especially in the night-time profile shots of her driving) doesn't exactly hurt, LOL.
B0029358GM|5.0|I just discovered Wilco about a month ago, and decided to try out their new album. I was very glad that I did, as I found it to be very poetic with some lovely, catchy melodies. Some favorites are \\"Country Disappeared\\", \\"I'll Fight\\", \\"Everlasting Everything\\", and \\"You and I\\". However, there is not a bad song on there! I have listened to the album several times, and it just gets better and better with each listen. I highly recommend it to brand new fans of the band, and to those who have been with them from the start. I plan to go back and listen to their older stuff too, and look forward to hearing what they sounded like in the beginning. A big thumbs up to Wilco. Long may they run!
0385504225|2.0|Much like a zillion other people who will buy this book, I anticipated a fast-paced pager turner.  I pre-ordered, looked forward to its release and read it almost straight through without pause.  If nothing else, Dan's books are easy to read.    Overall, I was disappointed.  It is nowhere near as good as his last bestseller.    Reasons:    1. No controversy. Come-on, Dan, where's the \\"real dirt\\" on the Masons? I was expecting \\"fireworks\\". You didn't hesitate to take on the Catholic Church, yet the \\"all-powerful\\" Masons gave you pause? Come on.    2. Nothing new. I'm pretty sure that I saw every tidbit of his research on one of several dozen History Channel documentaries.    3. A bit preachy. Especially towards the end. Come on, the big \\"treasure\\", the much sought after \\"word\\", is a bible? OMG.    4. Evil son. Come on. I have to imagine that every reader with a pulse saw this coming at about chapter 27.    5. Mason ceremonies. Maybe I'm just jaded, but I think Dan was more impressed, and even frightened, by the \\"secret\\" ceremonies that I am. The details provided were redundant, and not scary at all. Silly maybe.    6. CIA involvement. National security is at stake because our \\"enemies\\" will see select government and political elite talking so scarily about killing, death and the like during Masonic rites. Are you kidding me? I couldn't help but think about the \\"lodge\\" segments in Flintstone cartoons I watched as a kid. Sinister?  Professional D & D by successful geeks, dorks and members of the lucky sperm club, maybe.    7. Tom Hanks. I simply cannot get him out of my mind.  As I'm reading, in my mind, I see Tom acting out the lines.  Painful indeed.
1416562605|4.0|Aravind Adiga truly portrays the real India. Though there are many books selling on the tag of 'realistic approach towards India', this book exactly hits the point. The author chose this form of story telling to make us understand the real meaning of what he meant through his text. How he portrays the hidden 'entrepreneurship' in an unfortunate yet impassioned India poor man is the best part of his approach. Though I am from India, I was having very meager exposure to the Indian caste based society. But as I came to know more about the caste system and binding of the people to it either by force or fate, I got more interested in reading this book. This book not only exposes the problems but also the causes which are creating them. Take the instance of the scene where the book's main character Balram goes to the government hospital for a treatment to his father suffering from Tuberculosis. The hospital conditions, the ward boy's recklessness and the doctor's approach towards treating the patients are shown in an utterly realistic way. The scene where balram's mother dies in the initial pages of the book almost left me with tears and tender heart. A must read if you are looking for something like exactly what it is to be an Indian, a poor Indian and yet having entrepreneurship qualities and the consequences he wld face.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour showcases Michael Jackson the performer better than any other DVD available from the King of Pop. Filmed in 1992, this video features non-stop dancing and incredible theatrics set to some of the greatest (mostly live) pop music of all time. Highlights include \\"Jam,\\" which kicks the show off with a bang after Michael pops up from under the stage, \\"Human Nature,\\" featuring some of his best dance moves, and a phenomenal performance of \\"Billie Jean\\" - moonwalk, white glove, and all. It's also wonderful to see Michael and Siedah Garrett share the stage for their duet \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You.\\" There is not a dull moment throughout the entire show. Even after the encore, an MJ look-a-like straps on a jet pack and soars above the stage. Yes, there is a lot of editing. Constant crowd shots of obsessive fans (from multiple concerts) become a little tedious, and a few of the songs are lip-synched. The footage is not HD and ought to be remastered. Still, this video is perfect for anyone who appreciates Michael's showmanship and otherworldly talent and wants to see it first hand. 4.5 Stars.
B001PPLJIQ|2.0|Vastly over-rated oscar hyped movie.  Largely nothing happens during this movie.  The first half-hour is kate and the kid in bed with about 30 shots of her breasts.  Then there is a drawn out court process with little complexity or intrigue.  The central question of law vs. moral responsibility in the concentration camp is interesting, although meekly explored.  Pretty dull movie that doesn't cover any new ground.  Over...rated   Saying that, Kate does give a strong performance.
B002C6K7N0|2.0|This is for those Megadeth fans who like \\"Countdown to Extinction.\\" It is not for those who like \\"Peace Sells.\\"  The first two songs really try -and they are impressive- but this album is over produced and it just sounds too clean; Too polished. It is however much better than Metallica's last one. Its not the old Megadeth you were hoping for though.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|MOVIE WAS GREAT THE VIDEO BROKE UP OR SKIPPED A FEW TIMES OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS FINE
B0025T65GC|5.0|Suppressed insanity is probably the best term I can think of to describe this album.  It will take you from a quiet, flowing stream to a screaming soundscape of madness.. and you'll love it.  Considering the mood changes, it's a bit odd to think of it as a contiguous listen, but aside from an odd break in 'Trainfire' Ki comes off more as a single musical experience than a set of individual tracks.  It's a bit drawn out at times, and some would say a few of the songs (Disruptr, Gato and Heaven Send) are too similar, but I think it all adds to the aforementioned cohesiveness of the album.  4 1/2 stars.
B001OBT3FM|5.0|I have watched this DVD several times now and have been overwhelmingly impressed by it. The Beethoven and Tchaikovsky are brilliantly played. The soloist, conductor,orchestra and setting could not be better. Each piece is a thrill to listen too. And watch the performers and the audience respond to one another. You will catch some of the enormous excitement of this  performance. High emotion runs like a powerful undercurrent in the whole production.    I think the above reviewer has said most else of what needs to be said about this outstanding performance. I would only add that there is no better performance of either the Beethoven or Tchaikovsky on DVD of which I am aware.    Buy this. You will very pleased that you did and have many an enjoyable evening watching it.
B000002AVF|5.0|By 1995, Mariah Carey was one of the most famous vocalists in the world. Her previous studio album, Music Box, was well on its way to Diamond status in the United States and had become a worldwide smash. For her next outing, she made some slight but not unnoticed changes to her pop formula. Daydream incorporates urban R&B and Hip-Hop into many of its songs, including lead single \\"Fantasy,\\" which is built around a popular Tom Tom Club sample, \\"Genius of Love.\\" That single would become one of Mariah's most successful, debuting at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. She collaborated with Boyz II Men on the eulogy \\"One Sweet Day,\\" a song that turns tragedy into triumph. It is one of the most beautiful songs both Mariah and Boyz II Men have ever recorded, and it is still the longest-running number one in American chart history. On Daydream, Mariah began one of her most successful partnerships with Atlanta hip-hop producer Jermaine Dupri. The two co-wrote \\"Long Ago,\\" her most urban song yet, and the smash hit \\"Always Be My Baby,\\" a slice of infectious pop-soul perfection that remains one of Mariah's signature songs. The Minnie Riperton-inspired \\"Underneath the Stars,\\" with its oozing harmonies and gentle bass and Rhodes piano, is one of Mariah and Walter Afanasieff's best collaborations. \\"Melt Away,\\" featuring Babyface on background vocals, is an incomparable slow jam that Mariah produced by herself. She even brilliantly dabbles in house music on the David Morales mix \\"Daydream Interlude.\\" Daydream managed to outsell even Music Box in the United States. It is quite simply her best album. It is the perfect blend of pop/adult-contemporary and urban/R&B, capturing Mariah at a transitional moment where she offers the best of both worlds. Her vocal control and flexibility are outstanding. She has never sounded more passionate or mature. If you have any early Mariah album, make it Daydream. 5 Stars.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|....and buy something you know you'll enjoy. Reading this book as about as exciting as reading a math book. Impossibly cobbled together characters and thin relationships. Dan Brown even got the CIA involved in doing and investigation (inside the USA which is against their mandaate as most people know) and shooting locks off of mysterious doors in the basement of the Capitol building. (I was reminded of the guy in the DiVinci Code who jumped out of a heliocopter with a sheet of canvas as a parachute) A completly improbable story line. When I get  minute I'm going to dump it off my K-2 and go back to someone like R. A. Salvatore who I know is writing fantasy and from whom I can get a readable book with solidly developed characters.
1433502410|5.0|Summary: The ESV Study Bible (and accompanying web site) is a great tool for personal study and family worship; it leads the way in breadth, depth, and innovation for a new generation of study Bibles.  Book Info    I. Why *this* study Bible?    Study Bibles are tools designed to help readers understand the text. Since there are so many Bible study tools to choose from nowadays, what features distinguish the ESV Study Bible among other options for  the Bible reader's tool belt?    A. Achieves balance and expertise with multiple scholars.    The advantage of having multiple experts rather than one main voice (i.e. the \\"John MacArthur\\" Study Bible, et. al.) is twofold. First, balance; second, expertise.    On balance, the biases and limitations of a single author approach are unavoidable. What if that  man has peculiar views which skew his interpretation of particular passages-who will provide a balancing voice? How could one man be an expert on all 66 books of the Bible? These hindrances are significantly mitigated by the ESV Study Bible's collective approach. Thus, instead of getting just one man's reflections the ESV Study Bible employs 95 Bible scholars and teachers all of whom share a firm commitment to the truthfulness of Holy Scripture.    On expertise, reading through the list of contributors is like walking down a hall of \\"who's who\\" in Evangelical scholarship. Now, the eminence of the scholars is not the important bit; however, what is important is that multiple experts in their respective fields are contributing notes according to their areas of expertise. Thus, the scholar who has spent his or her career studying a particular book (or books) gets to contribute his or her deep, wide, and mature study of the text.    B. Explains redemption history and literary features.    Two large difficulties constantly confront the reader of the Bible: (1) How does a particular book fit together? What is the storyline of, say, the book of Genesis? (2) How does the Bible as a whole fit together? Is there an overarching narrative connecting the individual books?    The ESV Study Bible presents aids on both scores: (1) On the individual book level the introduction to each book includes sections on salvation history and literary features of that book. Also, the study notes within each book contain specially-shaded notes to indicate the literary structure for the book's large sections and individual scenes. (2) On the overall level, the articles include an \\"overview of the Bible,\\" and both the Old and New Testaments are preceded by significant introductory materials which cover topics such as: the date of the Exodus, introduction to the Pentateuch, the time between the testaments, the Roman empire and Greco-Roman world, and Jewish groups in New Testament times. Furthermore, the ESV Study Bible presents an introductory article on the theology of the Old Testament    C. Presents all new notes.     Some study Bibles have notes which strikingly resemble one another. For example, the introductions to the individual books of the Bible in R. C. Sproul's 2005 study Bible bear a very similar resemblance  to those of the 2003 Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible. Not so with the ESV study Bible. All the notes are fresh, up-to-date, and reflect current scholarship.  Avoids topical agendas; Lets God speak.    While topical-based study Bibles (i.e. the \\"manly man\\" study Bible, the \\"teen\\" study Bible, the \\"spiritual renewal\\" study Bible, the \\"women's\\" study Bible, et. al.) may have a useful purpose in some contexts, such topical approaches tend to favor one theme or topic to the exclusion of many others. Thus, due to nearsightedness the reader misses the richer interrelations of the wide variety of themes throughout the Bible.    The ESV Study Bible, on the other hand, does not so limit itself to a particular theme or to a specific sociological interest group; rather, it seeks to let God be heard in all that He has spoken and to all generations, young and old. Therefore, this study Bible is particularly well suited for family worship.  Includes useful web site.    When you purchase an ESV Study Bible you are actually purchasing two products-Each Bible comes with an access code to the ESV Study Bible Website. In addition to providing all the charts, maps, articles, and study notes of the print edition, two features add value for study purposes: First, the search feature allows you to perform keyword and string searches on the biblical text; Second, the notes feature allows you to add your own notes to an individual verse or to an entire chapter. For more features try the free preview.    D. Presents beautiful, full-color charts and maps.     View examples at the ESV Study Bible web site.      II. Critiques    All in all I think this study Bible is a wonderful study tool. The following comments are suggestions for further improvement on a few \\"little things\\":       1. The paper thickness for individual pages of the hardback edition is slightly too thin for my liking. (The full color maps in the back, however, are printed on heavier stock.) Nonetheless, there is no significant bleeding between pages, and the text is highly readable.     2. Due to its girth (Amazon lists the ESV study Bible at a 4.7 lbs shipping weight; compare the Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, which weighs in at 3.2 lbs shipping weight), the hardcover edition is slightly heavy to hold and a tad awkward to carry around. Nevertheless, I have seen at least one person carrying the hardcover edition to church. I find myself using the hardcover either in my lap or on the kitchen table.     3. The search feature on the accompanying web site needs the following improvements: (a) the ability to search the study notes and (b) a larger input text box on the search form itself.
0385341008|2.0|A vastly superior book that also takes place in the Channel Islands during World War II is The Book of Ebenezer LePage by G. B. Edwards.  Ranked by some as one of the best novels ever written, it is now back in print.  Thankfully, its resemblance to Potato Peel Pie ends with the setting.  Regrettably, it is the only book written by its author.  CCMartin
B00009RAJJ|5.0|When you put on this album, it's not rock music you're wanting -- it's Fleetwood Mac music. It might take a few years to see how much better this is than RUMOURS, which has a few great songs but not this measure of cohesion, and is not this complete an achievement in terms of distinction. I've determined that what makes this record rock in such style is mostly the mastery of rhythm by the apparently underrated Mick Fleetwood. Check out the intensely seductive use of restraint on \\"Brown Eyes.\\" By the song's end, you've had to stop yourself several times from lustfully grabbing this Christine \\"sha-la-la\\"-shimmer persona cooing to you -- you have to \\"respect\\" this woman or this waif...so you check back to what the beat is telling you; it does a few things to be sure; and then, THEN, at fade-out, Mick's drums finally let your hips slam her in full 4x4 time. So the rhythm isn't about license, it's about priming your body. What also helps with the cohesive style is having Christine grab ahold of so many songs because either she simply does them better, or Stevie was in the bathroom. Nicks does give us the best ballad here, \\"Storms\\"; almost as good as the ballads McVie usually gives. But you sense the sophisticated collaborative chemistry of the band when Christine sings, and you smile at her raspy \\"yeah!\\"s and how a tune can go from 0 to 60 in the first half-bar and still have something great to make you feel on more than one level. Now you're rocking with the band who's giving you the best of their career. In my opinion, MIRAGE is Mac's other album where every song is mature and a winner.<br />UPDATE: the remaster is not up to the quality of Bill Inglot's work on the Yes catalogue the previous year. Slightly better bottom sound but muddier highs than the old CD.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This particular recording is recommended in several reputable opera sources as the best recording of \\"Turandot.\\" I have seen a live performance, and this recording will not disappoint.
B000BBOV8U|5.0|Glad to see a lot of positive reviews regarding this release.  First, if you were lucky to get this when it first came out, you got a pretty awesome concert DVD with it, which makes this a pretty good value right off the bat.  I was exposed to Bryan Adam's music driving up and down the east coast and watching MTV before it became Reality-TV.  Let's face it, these are all songs you can sing to with a smile on your face, or sing while missing that special someone.  Disc one has all the songs you know from the 80's:  Straight From the Heart, Cuts Like a Knife, This Time, Run to You, Somebody, Summer of '69, One Night Love Affair.  All songs that rock.  Yes there are the ballads but you know you can sing along with them too and still be cool.  Disc 2 covers his career from 1993 until 2005.  This is when his career slowed down a bit, but allow yourself the pleasure of being introduced to some of these songs.  Yes, the beat has slowed down, but the songs are still good:  Please Forgive Me, All For Love (with Sting and Rod Stewart), Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman?, Rock Steady (from the Bonnie Raitt CD \\"Road Tested\\", and \\"The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You\\", one of my favorites of his 1990's hits.  Another bonus is the booklet which accompanies this CD, where Bryan gives the back story on every song on this CD, along with instrumental credits.  If you don't own \\"So Far, So Good\\", pick this one up for a longer career overview, or if you do own it, pick this up anyway and get into Bryan's good songs from the 1990's.  Oh, and sonically, the rockers rock out, and the ballads are smooth so you won't go wrong with this CD.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|It just keeps getting better.  Season 3 is the best. Cant wait for Season 4.
B000002H33|5.0|I started out reading the one-star reviews on this site first, and I have to tell you that I cannot understand them. First-off I've been a Metallica fan since I was roughly 9 years old (I am 30 now). So it's safe for me to say that they really really suck now. I mean seriously everything after And Justice For All, (when they switched producers from Flemming Rasmussen to Bob Rock) is just a downward spiral of suckiness. They are old and not doing anything good with their music and need to stop making music.        Now with that said I want to review the album. There is not one bad song on here - not one song that you could say was \\"filler\\". Some of the best musicianship ever! I am a guitar player for over 19 years now and I have to say that I grew up playing those riffs, and they are still fun to play, and they still sound amazing. This is one of the most influental albums of all time. Yes, I know there is better guitar work out there (I am an avid fan of players like: Satriani, Vai, E. Johnson, Jason Becker, Marty Friedman, Jeff Loomis, Yngwie, Petrucci, and other virtuosos, but this is when Kirk Hammett was at his best. The tightness of them all playing together, the imagery, just beautiful (albeit morbid), but you didn't just listen to the songs - you entered them and watched them unfold like dreams or stories. This is one of the albums that will always be a classic and will NEVER die. As for all the people who are saying things like \\"metal is poison and makes you suicidal\\" those people should not comment on albums like this. It would be the same if I commented on Gangsta Rap. Obviously these people have never heard of Norwegian Black Metal - that really is (mostly - admit it) Satanic. Master of Puppets = not Satanic - not poisonous. If they took the time to hear the intricacies of the music they would see that it is nothing short of great classical music not unlike Beethoven, Bach, or Paganini. In short - this album is a definitive masterpiece, and at the risk ofsounding \\"poisoned & suicidal\\" I think that the naysayers should just go back to listening to Taylor Swift, Hannah Montana, and Jonas Brothers - we don't need you trying to join the Metal Militia. You will never understand, and we don't care - cause your music sucks - just like your pathetic, insignificant lives, and we don't care if you die. Go be suicidal to Miley Cyrus - in your unintelligent whorish Lady Gaga lives.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I am a Dexter fan to the core and season 3 was greatness. I do have to say the season finale was a bit of a let down BUT am anxiously awaiting season 4!!!!!!! Hope the kid looks more like Rita though...lol
B000PC6A3E|1.0|If you are a batman fan this is the movie to see. We start at Bruce Wayne's beginnings and travel with him as he trains to become the Dark Knight.The script was approved by DC comics and therefore holds more truth to the original story than the \\"Batman\\" movies before it. Christian Bale was a really great casting choice as he has the duality to play both the suave Bruce Wayne and the haunted Batman. Micheal Caine, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman played their characters with the great skill that we've come to expect from these legendary actors. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Dr. Jonathan Crane was amazing and complex. I look forward to the next movie in this remarkable new series.
0440241901|5.0|The book was in good shape and came very quickly.  I usually read more serious books but this was completely enjoyable and nice change for me.  I would recommend this as a good vacation book.
0385504225|2.0|The book gets progressively worse from start to finish. I kept on reading in hopes that it would redeem itself in the end, it doesn't. I skimmed the last few chapters, as they felt completely unnecessary after the so-called revelation. I feel this book is a rip off for fans of The DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons. It seems as though the author was just trying to milk more money from his fans. This book was a big disappointment, and often annoying with the long explanations and thoughts of the stale characters. And I am tired of the author creating a so-called love story between the leading lady and Langdon in his books, there is just no chemistry. It was a waste of money--do NOT buy it.
B0025KVLU6|4.0|At this point I've listened to a half a dozen of the Beatles remasters.  All have been cleaned up sonically to a point.  The White Album is no different.  On these discs, I feel that the drums and acoustic guitars gained the most, both gaining depth that adds to the overall sound without overshadowing all the parts that we have been listening to for centuries...well, decades.  Here and there throughout this album you pick up nuances that might have been muddled by the original analog recordings.    The softer songs gain a great deal in this set.  You can hear the guitarist tapping his feet to keep time on numerous tunes, whereas prior to this remaster, it was more felt than heard.  It was a pleasure to hear these nuances anew.    That being said, in a side to side comparison, there is a definate increase in the overall volume on this disc as opposed the other remasters that I have listened to.  Generally, many complain of the loss of the softer passages with this increased volume, but in this case I do not feel that it distracts in the least.    This is a great album and remaster, but there are too many throw away tunes on here for my liking, so I rate this one a solid 4 stars.  Recommended.
1931559317|3.0|This is a very precise atlas, but it is not for beginners or those who don't read the map very well. It's in latitude/longitude terms and diagrams.
0385504225|1.0|I was looking forward to  great read.What i got was a lot of historical mishmash and the actions of people who were supposedly highly intelligent. Oh, My! What bumbling idiots. And the whole book is about 200 pages too long with all the Mumbo Jumbo and mystical meanderings. Don't wast your time with this one. The movie will probably be better and at least, you can watch it without having to wade throough the mire of the book. Gag.
B001EN71DG|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, this is the ONLY edition of the Star Wars trilogy worth buying because only here will you get the original 70s & 80s versions of the classic films - the movies that defined a genre and the movies we fell in love with.  (Mind you, these are the bonus discs.  I guess you can use the other three for sun-catchers or coasters for your coffee table.)  Gone are the awkward juxtapositions of the original special effects (based on painstakingly hand-crafted models) with nasty-looking CGI short-cuts.  Other benefits:    - No silly scenes in the Tatooine hanger with a much less feared & respected Jabba  - Han shoots first!  - Hear the Ewok celebration song in its entirety!  - No bizarre appearance of the ghost of Hayden Christensen at the end of Return of the Jedi!  - The plant from Little Shop of Horrors no longer caught in the throat of the great Sarlacc!  - Original nude slave wrestling scene returned to scene in Jabba's palace!    Ok, I think I may have dreamt that last one, but STILL!  This is all cinematic history, and Lucas was wrong to mess with it.  Cheers!
B0025KVLTM|5.0|I have so far purchased several of the remastered discs, this one included. I have been a huge fan since I can remember, buying the LP's and then the '87 CD's back when they were first made available. I am very familiar with the music and the different mixes available. I have read reviews both positive and negative regarding these remasters and all I can say is that there is an improvement in the overall sound on these recordings. They are not gonna bring forth never-before heard sounds, but the sound is 'livelier' than before, especially on all the vocals and acoustic instruments.  One thing that comes to mind is the whole remix debate. While I understand all fans were not going to be content with the original stereo mixes, it's the mono mixes everybody refers to when talking about the definitive mixes because The Beatles were actually present for those. If that's the case, why weren't the stereos remixed and the mono left alone? I guess they had the 'purists' in mind for these releases. For now, we'll have to be happy with these releases. If you're a casual fan and already have the original CD's, save your money. For the Beatle fan who is going to buy everything anyway, enjoy - they are better!
0064407667|5.0|A Series of Unfortunate Events is an unfortunate, twisted, fiendish book series, a phrase which here means \\"A series of books.\\" But on a more serious note, and not copying the books (which could also double as a dictionary!) It is a great story of three clever orphans who see misery and woe at every turn. To make matters worse, they are sent to live with Count Olaf, who is the main source of their pain. He overworks them, all the while plotting to steal the massive fortune they will someday inherit. In a daring atempt at the Baudelaire fourune, Olaf makes up a plan so evil that no one believes the orphans when they try to get help. Curious? Read this book, The Bad Beginning, by Lemony Snicket (Daniel Handler). It is an exciting book and fun to read, as the Baudelaires find out that in the midst of their suffering, they still have each other.   Personally, I thought the book was very enjoyable. It was a story that, to me, said that even when adults sometimes don't believe kids or think  they can do anything, sometimes kids are the ones who know better (sometimes). I would highly recommend this book.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|This book falls well short of the Da vinci code, which I found to be enjoyable and engaging.  in comparison &#34;the lost symbol&#34; is badly written and annoying. I don't know whether it was the repeated non-surprises, the jarring way that Brown inserts encyclopaedic descriptions devoid of any literacy, or the fact that I found it hard to care what happened, but this book scored so highly on the &#34;outburst&#34; score that my wife told me to read it somewhere else. it is rare that a work of fiction can make me angry but Mr. Brown managed it without breaking a sweat. Truly shocking.
0385340575|2.0|Years ago, I loved Child's [[ASIN:0440245990 The Enemy: A Reacher Novel (Jack Reacher Novels)]] where I first became aware of Reacher's analytical-ness; running numeric calculations almost obsessively. The loads of fine geographic detail of the more obscure locales where Reacher hung out added authenticity.<br /><br />Maybe because I went to high school in Manhattan so know it very well, that I found the endless text about the subway system, 59th street, Union Square... which hotel is at what address... got very, very tedious. How about more of Reacher's insubordination, recalcitrance, irony, smart-mouth retorts...? Reacher seemed less cartoony in this novel than in some of the earlier ones, but not by much. Maybe Reacher novels have had their run, and Child is lapsing into contempt for loyal readers, like so many successful novelists do?<br /><br />Maybe the Reacher movies (the back of the book says all the Reacher books have been optioned) will have script writers (not Child, who was a script writer) who will move the plot along more crisply as well as add better dialog? I wonder who might be cast as Reacher?<br /><br />Oct 2012<br />Tom Cruise will be Reacher. The movie, titled \\"Reacher\\" is announced to be released around Christmas. Reacher has been described in all the books to be 6'5\\", 250 lbs and sandy-haired. Well, maybe with camera angles and optical illusions, Tom Cruise can be made to look taller and he had already appeared in a movie with grey hair. With blue contacts, he too, can become blue-eyed and sandy-haired. Or Lee Child can change the fictional character.
0385504225|5.0|At the risk of sounding too enthusiastic, I'm going to be completely frank here. This is the smartest, wisest novel so far published in the 21st Century. It's a super page-turner, too, but that tends to get lost in the wit and wisdom Dan Brown offers to an entertainment consuming public sorely in need of tales with substance. No doubt the novel will irk those with established interests to protect, but hopefully it will also inspire thought and discussions about the bigger picture humanity is part of. If you have ever thought about truth, religion, or the direction mankind is taking, read this book - you'll enjoy it!
B001O9CEGY|5.0|(This may be considered a bit of a spoiler!) Author Agatha Christie hasn't been called the Queen of Crime for no reason. This book tells the suspenseful tail of ten people who are mysteriously invited to a dinner party on a gloomy island. Expecting only a ime of merriment, they agree and join each other on the island. As the dinner wraps up, they retire to a parlor, where the real reason for their ivitation is revealed. Someone named \\"Mr. Owen\\" is trying to have justice served. Each of the ten has been convicted of a crime, for which they either were never charged or released. Mr. Owen, the man behind the \\"game\\", decides the only way to be sure they get what they deserve is to kill them, one by one. The thing is, the only evidence they have that Mr. Owen exists is a record he's left the frightened guests. The kicker? The murders are based on a gruesome nursery rhyme, the \\"Ten Little Indians.\\" Hidden beneath the seemingly harmless poem are clues to how each guest will die, and it also serves as a warning. Will they make it out alive? The only way to find out is to read \\"And Then There Were None\\" by Agatha Christie.<br />This was a thriller of a book that kept me wanting to read more.  Agatha Christie \\"reveals\\" the killer almost from the very beginning, the reader just doesn't know it yet, not until the end. I had to read it a couple of times to fully understand it. And the ending will suprise and shock you!
0385340575|4.0|For pure entertainment value, Lee Child has been tops with me since I stumbled onto \\"The Persuader\\" and subsequently devoured the entire series. His last book, \\"Nothing to Lose\\" was such a disappointment (see my panning review) that I wasn't sure I wanted to try another of the Reacher series. However, after encouragement from another Lee Child fan, I picked up \\"Gone Tomorrow\\", and was pleased to find the return of Jack Reacher.    As with most Reacher stories (except Nothing to Lose), the hook gets set early, and this book does not disappoint. By page 4, I was riveted.  The story slowly loses pace and becomes a bit of a whodunnit mystery until about 2/3 of the way through.  There was too much development of good guy/bad guy ambiguity and not enough Reacher ass-kicking for my taste. Child makes up for the lack of mid-story excitement with a terrific terrorist showdown climax and Reacher at his best. As with most Reacher stories, the plot was contrived and has gaps that don't stand up to close analytic scrutiny. However, the story flowed, was coherent and was believable- a huge improvement over the \\"Nothing to Lose\\" debacle. I was disappointed that one of the plot elements went unresolved, but that was part of the story. There was almost none of the distracting politicization that intruded into \\"Nothing to Lose\\".  I think the old Jack is Back.    Compared to other books in the Child/Reacher series, I give this story an overall 3.8/5.0, and a 4.8/5.0 in redemption quality vs. the \\"Nothing to Lose\\" lemon. Definitely worth a read.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Another great season.  Love what they're doing with all the characters.  Can't wait until next season.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Classic!  I'm very glad to own this book in it's Kindle edition and for a very reasonable price too, $0.00!  There is not anything that I could write that hasn't been written before about Mr. Holmes and his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  These stories are timeless, they are indeed short stories and may be read quickly in one sitting, and, for me, be read again and again.  While reading these stories I can't help but see and hear Jeremy Brett, the ultimate and best Holmes of any visual media. Ever!  The mannerisms of Holmes as written by Doyle, as well as much of the dialog, are transferred accurately and brilliantly to the small screen by Brett, the BBC, and PBS.  I also recommend this series on DVD for any and all Holmes fans.    Not to forget \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes,\\" also priced reasonably on Kindle at $0.00.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|Epic, heart-wrenching, beautiful, haunting, inspired, an absolute masterpiece!  It's truly astonishing this late in the game, Judas Priest makes something this special and gets almost no credit for it, while other metal bands half their age are just struggling to string together 50 minutes of competent music!  How did they do this???    I'm usually much more specific in my reviews, but I'm so moved by this record, I can't bring myself to pick it apart.  It's a wonder!    There was talk of a live performance of this whole record for DVD, I hope so much that they do it!
0385504225|2.0|Yes, it's a familiar formula for anyone who has read Dan Brown's prior work: solve a mystery under a time crunch; wrap up the story in about 24 hours of \\"real time\\"; leave the reader hanging at the end of most chapters; fill in the background with flashbacks or monologues; and have the clues be in symbols. Don't forget the faith/science theme. Still, the book works. Not as literature but as entertainment.    On most levels \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is a standard crime/mystery novel plus Masonic symbols. Brown skills as a storyteller, coupled with the now-familiar task of figuring out the symbols, are enough to keep the reader interested. I'm sure some loyal readers will love it and others will absolutely hate it. I can hear them now: \\"National Treasure has already done DC,\\" \\"Same book/different city/country/continent,\\" and maybe even \\"Dan Brown hates football.\\" (Not a spoiler, just a comment as to how far I expect someone to go to be offended by this book.) Color me lukewarm. It's not especially good or bad.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|Who Knew?  Yes, that is what I said!  Who knew that Crowe could do such an amazing job on dry witt in a comedy.  This movie was a breath of fresh air.  Just delightful!  All the actors were cast so perfectly, and the wonderful views of the rural Italy were just so breathtakingly soft to the eye.  I loved this movie so much that I even bought the soundtrack. A treat for the eyes, ears, and heart!
B00005JPTK|5.0|I thought that this movie was great as a teenage thrill seeker, but if I was an actual critic, I would have to say a couple things about it.    First, both endings were not interesting, they left me feeling \\"what the h*** just happened? is it done just like that?\\". Second, if you were going to watch this movie with little kids, don't. It is at some points scary.     On the positive side, the theme of the story was captivating, and left me wondering for many weeks whether such a story could possibly happen to humans.
0439023491|5.0|So I know I am a little farther behind then everyone else, but I decided to be patient like a good girl and wait for my copy to come into the library. Let me tell you, it was well worth the wait.<br /><br />Winning the Hunger Games was nothing like Katniss thought it would be. Instead of being relieved to be home, she is tormented not only by the nightmares about the games, but by the way her life is progressing.<br /><br />Her berry trick caused such a raucous around the country of Panem, that President Snow is worried about rebellions and uprisings as her actions were seen as a direct threat to the control exerted by the Capitol.<br /><br />Her relationship with Gale seems irreparably damaged and her \\"relationship\\" with Peeta is strained when the cameras are gone. Her mother and Prim are safe at home with her, but she can't seem to shake this feeling that something still isn't right.<br /><br />When the 75th Hunger Games theme, the 3rd Quarter Quell, is announced everyone is shocked to find that the surviving victors are going back into the arena.

0385504225|1.0|The most dissapointing investment in a book  I've ever made.<br />From  a pretty well crafted Da Vinci Code, and Digital Fortress, the authors writing has degenerated to the point I believe the original manuscript for the Lost Symbol had to have been written in crayon.<br />Then edited by spell check.<br />Sorry Mr. Brown.<br />Who made you write this silly thing?

0385504225|5.0|I just finished reading Dan Browns latest novel, and I couldn't put it down. On the surface, this book is about Robert Langdon (as we know him from 'the Da Vinci Code'), somehow getting involved with the Freemasons in a frantic race spanning a time period of 12 hours, chasing all over Washington DC at night, while deciphering ancient symbols and codes,solving mysterious riddles, and fighting the ultimate villain, a mortal guy with a brilliant but sick brain turned monster. The plot is somewhat similar to the `Da Vinci Code'    Granted, what we learn here about Freemasonry is fascinating. Ultimately though, this story is about ancient philosophies and forgotten messages and wisdoms that bite us in the nose every day where ever we look, and the regrettable fact that most people are not open minded enough these days to be able to perceive them. He confronts us with the common but arrogant assumption that the 21st century and its technology and achievements is mankind at its peak. We are encouraged to consider the idea that ancient philosophies and cultures might have been well ahead of modern knowledge, and that cutting edge science is just about to catch up with what in essence has already been known millenniums ago.     This resonates with me. I was lucky enough to have a teacher in high school who introduced us to Einstein's special theory of relativity, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, all rounded up with a nice background in philosophy. I have a masters degree in science, but philosophies and religions from all  over the world kept fascinating me until today.    So Dan Browns idea is simple: take all this heavy food for thought and wrap a nice, fast paced suspense thriller around it that people can easily enjoy and dismiss as pure entertainment. The author himself is pulling his own leg a little when putting the reader in Langdon's shoes, the skeptical scientist: `Ironically this same code had been a plot twist in a mediocre thriller Langdon had read years ago'.    This book has to be read between the lines if you want to understand what the author wants to get across. Here is what he really wants folks to think about: Quote \\"From the crusades, to the Inquisition, to American politics - the name Jesus had been hijacked as an ally in all kinds of power struggles. Since the beginning of time, the ignorant had always screamed the loudest, herding the unsuspecting masses and forcing them to do their bidding. They defended their worldly desires by citing Scripture they did not understand. They celebrated their intolerance as proof of their convictions. Now, after all these years, mankind had finally managed to utterly erode everything that had once been so beautiful about Jesus\\".    And I can see why it Dan Brown six years to finish this novel, he poured an enormous amount of research into this book. While the plot is fiction, the facts for the most part are not. I couldn't help but google along on my computer as I read, and many times the search results left me flabbergasted.     Read this book open minded, as the wisdom within is hidden in a big spoonful of sugar. Not many of us like bitter medicine straight up after all ;-)
0547258305|3.0|Graces are supposed to be gifts. How is the ability to fight extremely well and kill anything a gift? Katsa, a young, female warrior has pondered that very question for most of her life. Her uncle, the King, uses her as an enforcer and she has caused more pain than she cares to remember. There is no hiding her abilities because not only is she incapable of just not fulfilling her grace, but her eyes give her away. All gracelings have two different colored eyes.    Her unparalleled abilities are what allow her an escape. She is given a wide berth by many in the kingdom, so she is free to do as she pleases. She chose to create an alliance of local citizens who right wrongs and injustices committed by the King. During one such mission, rescuing an old man from prison, she meets a fellow graceling. Her mission and the graceling have more in common than she first realizes and soon she finds herself, along with some trusty side-kicks, on a quest to discover the plot behind the kidnapping of the imprisoned man.    An enthralling fusion of fantasy, adventure, and love, this debut novel is sure to capture your imagination. It's a little bumpy towards the end, but still a fabulous piece of work for a first-time author.
0783226845|5.0|The movie has been well reviewed by others.  I shall add that the feature that compelled me to add it to my collection is the tango by Pacino and Gabrielle Anwar.  That scene is something to watch over and over.  It is poetry embodied, with music, in an elegant setting, with an appreciative movie audience that reflects the viewers' awe.
B002GZQYMK|3.0|I have been a fan of Muse ever since i saw them at the 2004 Big Day Out, and since have been one of my favourites.  I was excited about the release of The Resistance, especially since the bands last outing Black Holes and Revelations was a piece of pure genius from Matt Bellamy and co.  Upon my first listen the only thing i could think of is this doesn't sound very much like Muse.  This album is a lot lighter with no really catchy song to hook you in.  No Knights of Cydonia, Starlight, Time Is Running Out, Plug In Baby, if you would.  My favourite track on the album is Undisclosed Desires, a track that is all electronic and does not sound like the Muse it's fans know and love, but is still a great track.  I was told by some friends that they had harnessed the spirit of Freddy Murcury and while some parts of this album are reminiscent of Queen, i wish they had stuck to this throughout the album, instead of going for a more classical piano stream of consciousness (don't get me wrong, Bellamy is a modern day master on the piano, but there is a little too much, such as the Chopin tune he plays in United States of Eurasia).  Don't get me wrong, this album is still a great listen, but Muse just seemed to hit it right in 2006's Black Holes and Revelations, and this seems more like a step backwards for the band.  I would recommend this album for fans of Muse and british rock in general.  However, if you are a new Muse fan, go and get a copy of Black Holes or Origins of Symmetry.  A good outing, but not their best.
B000UR9QHQ|4.0|Beginning in 1978 the landscape of cinema changed forever with the introduction of one knife-wielding, masked killer named Michael Myers. The film that introduced audiences to this man was the seminal horror classic \\"Halloween\\". With this one movie director John Carpenter (\\"Escape from New York\\") launched his directing career to new heights, and made Jamie Lee Curtis into a movie star (\\"True Lies\\"). Not to mention, the monster success of this low-budget horror thriller subsequently created an entire sub-genre of horror known as the slasher film.<br /><br />\\"Halloween\\" centers on the sleepy little town of Haddonfield, Illinois. For most people, Haddonfield appears to be the most idyllic place to live; however, beneath the surface lays a deadly secret. Fifteen years ago, on Halloween night, a deranged young boy named Michael Myers murdered his older sister. Now, all these years later, Michael has escaped from a mental institution and is returning home to continue what he started so long ago.<br /><br />I don't know about the rest of you, but I personally find it strange to refer to a horror film as a classic in any regard. Because for the most part, entries into this genre are some of the most forgettable movies ever committed to film no matter how many sequels they may generate. However, with \\"Halloween\\" John Carpenter created a movie that was more in the vein of a thriller than previous horror titles, resulting in a movie that still stands relatively unchallenged by its genre, even to this day. So, to say that this is a classic horror film, a feat that doesn't seem that hard to achieve, is nothing short of the truth.<br /><br />In my opinion, the key to why John Carpenter's vision of that horror-filled October 31st remains so resonant with audiences is due to the way he used the camera to bring the viewer into the events. Unlike most modern horror films, well truthfully any horror film made since the release of \\"Halloween\\", this one opts to not rely on buckets and buckets of blood and gore to freak out audiences. Instead, John took a much more innovative approach by imbuing the film with an atmosphere saturated with a foreboding sense of terror and dread; thus, keeping the viewers in an almost constant state of suspense from start to finish. In addition, Carpenter filmed many scenes with these slow-moving tracking shots that were designed to give the audience the unsettling viewpoint of virtually being in Michael Myers' shoes as he methodically stalks his prey. If it weren't for the ingenuity of John Carpenter on display while filming this movie, some of which may have been a result of the film's tiny budget, \\"Halloween\\" would most likely not have been the often imitated and respected movie that it is today.<br /><br />With all that being said, I don't want to diminish the story's impact on the film's long-lasting appeal. Co-written by John Carpenter and Debra Hill (\\"Escape from L.A.\\"), the screenplay is a nearly perfect example of how a horror film, or thriller for that matter, should be paced to allow the tension within the story to naturally build from moment to moment until it reaches its maximum potential for the final act. Both Carpenter and Hill were smart enough to not rush the story to get to the scares quicker, an approach ignored by the majority of horror films released these days. By not rushing into the horror aspect, the screenplay takes some time in attempting to develop the characters, especially Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence).<br /><br />Also, the story preys upon many people's fear of the mysterious and unknown by taking the less is more approach to showing Michael on screen. This move was both bold and brilliant all at once, and again is a tactic ignored by modern day slasher films. By placing Michael predominantly in shadows, the story escalates the audience's apprehension, because now, they aren't even sure where he's going to strike from next. To me, if I'm a horrordirector, this is one movie that I would study over and over, because it seems to be that this is the film by which all others are compared.<br /><br />While the storyline played a very pivotal role in the success of this film, it is not without its share of problems. As a horror movie one must expect certain faults to be evident in the story; however, that still doesn't excuse them from being noted either. For instance, the various characters in the movie are, for the most part, given very little to do other than potentially serve as fodder for Michael. Now this doesn't apply to Jamie's character or Donald Pleasence's, both of theirs received numerous moments of development, and the movie benefits greatly from those times. But if your character doesn't happen to be as important as either one of those two... Look out. Most likely you'll end up appearing as little more than a horny teenager heading for a not-so pleasant demise at the business end of a knife.<br /><br />Another area this movie suffers, to an extent, is in the dialogue, which seems like a common problem for many a horror movie. There are areas of the movie that are well-written and polished, but other times the characters sound as if their brains have been removed and they're just making pointless, inane conversation. Although to be fair, some of the dialogue problems may have had more to do with the actor or actress speaking the line rather than the actual line itself.<br /><br />The acting in this film is a mixed bag of surprisingly good performances and those that are barely average or below. Leading the cast was the relatively unknown (at the time) Jamie Lee Curtis. I still am impressed by the work Jamie put into creating Laurie. The innocence and naivet&eacute; that she displays is what makes her so endearing to the audience, resulting in us rooting for her survival all the more. Her compassion and bravery during the more harrowing scenes her character goes through are also very commendable. It is not often in horror movies that the characters appear to be as genuinely concerned for the safety of others over their own. Within these moments for Laurie Strode I believe John Carpenter really excelled in driving home her maturity and development as a character over the course of the film.<br /><br />Veteran actor Donald Pleasence, whose character of Dr. Sam Loomis shares nearly as much screen time as Jamie's, delivered to audiences a character that could have been written off as being one dimensional by so many other actors. Donald portrayed Loomis with an interesting mix of fierce determination to stop Michael's reign of terror, and also an underlying remorse for not being able to cure Michael of his bloodlust. It was this dichotomy within the role that made him an intriguing member of the cast for not only this movie, but the numerous sequels that followed in which he co-starred.<br /><br />The remaining characters in the movie are easily forgotten, but I would be remiss not to mention the less than stellar performances from the movie. First off, we have actress Nancy Kyes (or Nancy Loomis as she was known back then), who gave easily the worst performance in the movie. Perhaps some people liked her character of Annie Brackett in this film, but I for one found her to be whiny, brash and irritating. Nancy's performance in the movie is the reason for why I earlier proposed that perhaps it was the actor or actress speaking the lines that made them sound bad rather than the line being poorly written. Her delivery was incredibly slow and at times painful to sit through as she struggled to get the words out in anything resembling a normal speech pattern. What's disappointing about the character of Annie is that in the hands of a more capable actress, perhaps she would have been a more likeable addition to the movie; instead, I hated almost every moment she was on screen.<br /><br />Lastly, there's actress P.J. Soles, who was given the role of Lynda, a character whose sole purpose was to provide the obligatory sex appeal that these movies typically contain. The role of Lynda was a complete waste of time and P.J.'s phoned-in performance didn't do anything to strengthen her character's paper-thin story arc either. At least with Nancy Kyes' character the script gave her more to do, it's just she wasn't able to really sell it. Perhaps P.J. should have been given the role of Annie rather than Nancy Kyes, because out of the two, P.J. is the more accomplished actress. Maybe with a different role P.J. could have given a better performance in this movie. Although, to be fair one would be hard pressed to find anything in this film, other than her looks, that shows how good P.J. Soles can be.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, of which there are several, \\"Halloween\\" still stands tall as one of the best horror movies of all-time. Featuring a relatively solid storyline, good acting from the two principal players, a reliance on creating genuine scares rather than gore, and one of the eeriest musical scores I've ever heard, \\"Halloween\\" birthed not only a popular movie franchise, but an entire sub-genre.

B001FB55H6|5.0|Great film, nothing to add other than this is the sort of film Blu Ray was made for and the fact that this is so much of a better version than our UK release, longer by miles. Works fine on a UK PS3...make sure your PS3 is updated to the latest Firmware release properly though as this has lots of flashy in-film extras to take advantage of..
B000089RVX|4.0|After reading most of the reviews, there's really not much that I can add. It is a great album. the only \\"defect\\" is that it's all in the same key. Amys voice is incredible. I just bought the CD, and I popped it in when I was driving. After I heard torniquet, I realized something I wasn't prepared for. It's a christian oriented band. ususally I never like Christian music because it's too preachy. The opposite is true here. She relates her beliefs, and trials and tribulations in a way that makes the message palpable. While Creed went overboard with it's Messiah complex, Evanessence delivers the message without ramming down your throat. The band is incredibe too. I wish she would change the key she sings in once in a while, and maybe show a bit more \\"bad girl\\" stuff.
B001SO6KNS|2.0|Blu-ray Video - Average (up-converting a DVD is almost the same to me)    Blu-ray Sound - Poor - The sound was loud when ths DVD loaded (level 16 on TV), then the titles and soundtrack of the movie were very low (level 30 on TV).  I prefer movies that I do not have to turn up and down while watching.    The movie was ok to watch 1 time.  The movie began strong with a wing chun sparring match that was  really good.  The fights started to become less and less realistic after.  The story of Ip Man, became  less and less like a biography, and more about 'The Legend of Ip Man' as the film continued.    I think my fundamental issue with the movie is that Ip Man was a real person, and the fights in this  movie started to violate physics.  I can accept this in fantasy movies, but not in supposed biographies.    'Dragon : A Bruce Lee story' was more realistic to me than this movie.  And if you have seen that one,  you will understand my frustration with Ip Man.    Read a book about Ip Man if you want to know the real person.  If you want to watch an action star  do some Wing Chun, pretend he is not Ip Man and watch this movie 1 time.    \\"Get the non blu-ray DVD and use up conversion, or find the whole film on youtube\\"

B000OCZD5G|5.0|First of all, get your media straight.  This is a blu-ray rating, not normal DVD!    The blu-ray quality on this movie is the best I have seen for a live-action, non-special effects movie.  The very first scene in the movie is a road moving past you at high speed as if you are straped to  the hood of a car.  The picture is perfectly clear.    The movie itself is also very entertaining and fast pace.    It is a real unique movie that is hardly made these days.
0143034901|3.0|I am a plot guy, I love reading a good story centered around a plot that unfolds with style and grace. I probably should love Shadow of the Wind because the plot here is just about everything one could ask for. The depth of the story telling is insane, and you can tell that the time and effort required by the author Zafon was enormous.     Mainly what disappointed me with this book was the authors hesitancy to unfold the narrative in a quicker fashion. I diligently read about two thirds of this story and then found myself flashing forwards through the pages as fast as I could to move the narrative along.  By this I mean that either their is so much unfolding that the story starts to bog down as Zafon catches up and tries to fill in missing pieces, or Zafon is just plain focusing on details while the greater story arc is left to languish.     In the end the story is suffocated under its own weight and its own cleverness. Too many scenes that could have been quickly alluded to and as another reviewer here said \\"to much emphasis on unnecessary atmospherics\\".     Another couple of authors you might want to check out if you enjoyed this book and are looking for others of a similar ilk. \\"Quincunx\\" by Palisner, and \\"Foucault's Pendulum \\" by Umbeto Eco.        I just wanted to say, I have been thinking about it, and this might be one of those books that is perfect to listen to. It might be that the narrative structure is ideally composed for a listener who is trapped and unable to flip forwards a page or sentence. Because their was a lot that was amazing here. Its a hard book to hold in check.
0385504225|1.0|This book is pretty boring and it was hard to finish.  I was very disappointed as I was very excited when Dan Brown started writing again instead of making movies, which were not very good. I was hoping for something as good as the other books he has written.

0385504225|5.0|I started reading Dan Brown 5 years ago when a friend handed me Angels and Daemons. A&D made me read all other DB books published previously. After reading The Lost Symbol I still maintain Angels and Daemons as his best book.<br /><br />I still give Symbol a 5 because despite the similarity in plot to all his other works Dan Brown is trying in a story format to convey his excellent understanding of Freemasonry and the spiritual laws that govern it. He also shares a view of religion that I believe is capable of saving the world if humanity embraces it. Apotheosis, or the potential of man as God, is a common theme across most religions and DB does a great job explaining it to a world that has lost the idea or would consider it as heresy. I thought Brown did a great job expressing the Freemasonic and spiritual leanings of the founding fathers of the United States and presented a view that I believe settles the debate over whether we are a Christian nation or not. His answer is that we are a spiritual nation that believes in decency towards others and a view of the whole world as creatures with a potential to become gods. This prospect makes any differences or disputes over religious issues insignificant and distracting from what we can truly become.<br /><br />A word about controversy. This view of man's destiny to become god is where the controversy lies in this book and I expect to see some heated discussions about it by the clergy in the coming weeks. To those who thought that DaVinci Code and its theories about the Virgin Mary were a source of controversy wait and see until the clergy read this book and understand the message it is conveying.<br /><br />I am glad that Brown did not succumb to conspiracy theories. I liked the spirit by which he portrayed the great craft of Freemasonry and the mature understanding of religion and spirituality which he portrayed during the book.<br /><br />Looking at some of the reviews that are already online it is unfortunate to note that many of these reviewers had such a narrow focus and failed to comprehend the great message within the story.had such a narrow focus and failed to comprehend the great message within the story.
0385486804|4.0|\\"Into the Wild\\" by John Krakauer is a book that holds very little immediate suspense.  Anyone not familiar with Chris McCandless's story will learn from the cover's description that he hitchhiked into the Alaska wilderness after selling off most of his earthly possessions and never made it out.  What \\"Into the Wild\\" has to offer its readers is a thorough examination of what was known about Chris McCandless and some educated speculation about what happened to him.  This is mixed in with Krakauer's examination of what made a reasonably intelligent, well-educated young man from a well-to-do family distance himself so entirely from society.  It is a question he doesn't necessarily have any answer for, but the journey of examination is definitely unforgettable.<br /><br />In April of 1992, Christopher McCandless cut himself off from his old life entirely, intent to discover some undiscovered, unpolluted area of Alaska and survive off the land.  This quest had its beginnings years prior, when during summer vacations from college, McCandless would travel solo across the country earning his living at odd jobs.  Along the way McCandless met several vagabonds like him, leaving an indelible impression upon them, their raw emotions at his loss laid bare for all to read in Krakauer's account.  Krakauer traces McCandless's travels across the country, interviewing the people he worked with along the way, before fully exploring his fatal trip off the Stampede Trail outside of Fairbanks, Alaska.  In an attempt to understand the motivation behind this enigmatic youth who willingly turned his back on his family, Krakauer mixes in accounts of other souls like Chris who have risked their lives to venture out on their own in pursuit of some dream.<br /><br />Krakauer is a talented writer; his reporting is intimate and detail oriented, and his interviews with those most touched by McCandless's death are harrowing, especially those with his family.  Yet where Krakauer fails with \\"Into the Wild\\" is interjecting himself into the story - while he warns of this at the beginning of the book, the two chapters dedicated to his mountain-climbing expedition seem out of place.  I understand he feels a connection with what drove McCandless on his journeys, but the book would be better without these too personal touches.  Also, the structure of the story is rather scattered; it seems to move back and forth in time, and the interruptions that don't add to the story disturb the pace of the story.  All in all, \\"Into the Wild\\" is a compelling read.  While it doesn't offer answers for McCandless's actions, it offers readers a glimpse into a unique soul who saw a way to live in this world that others do not see.  It makes one wonder what McCandless might have done if he had not met his death in the Alaska wilderness.cting himself into the story - while he warns of this at the beginning of the book, the two chapters dedicated to his mountain-climbing expedition seem out of place.

Metheny's virtuosity is unprecedented and the team (Metheny & Mays) fails not to produce gem after gem.      This album is more 'straight ahead' than the other PMGs (less fusion-y) except when it comes to the title track.

1400034779|4.0|Mme Precious Ramotswe finds herself taking care of her father after suffering through an abusive marriage in which her husband leaves her. When her father is on his death bed, he tells Precious that he has enough cattle for her to be able to sell and buy a business so that she can have a good life. She decides to open her own detective agency rather than purchase an existing business. Since a woman owns and runs the the No. 1 Ladies Detectives Agency, that makes it the only agency of it's kind in Africa.    I will admit that I didn't expect to like this book, but it turned out to be a surprisingly enjoyable read. It was very charming and pleasant. The cases that Precious has are not the kind of criminal cases that I typically read about. They're more human. She looks for missing persons, tries to catch cheating husbands, even follows around a teenage girl for her father. I enjoy her ways of thinking and the way she deals with these people. Some of the cases are touching, while some are slightly humorous. I look forward to reading the next installment in the series.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|In this tear jerking drama Will Smith trades in his super hero cape and takes up the role of an average Joe. No saving the world this time, instead his fight is to give his son a better life. After what seems like a lifetime of misfortune and bad luck Chris Gardner (Smith) is left alone to raise his son (Jaden Smith). The only problem is he barely has enough money to keep a house over their heads. The only glimmer of hope they have left is an internship at Dean Witter a stockbroker company. This may turn out to be the job of a lifetime, but with every glimmer there is always an obstacle course that guards its way. Of course this case is no different, not only is Chris up against nineteen other well educated candidates who have plenty more experience, but the internship doesn't pay a cent. Chris finds himself questioning whether or not this risk is worth taking and we find ourselves hoping with heavy hearts and watery eyes that it is.    The Pursuit of Happiness is jam packed with hard-hitting emotion. Good luck getting through this one without shedding a tear. With a story that hits so close to home for so many of us, it can be almost painful to watch. Many of us on some level know the struggle that Smith's character faces, we know all about that horrible feeling of helplessness we feel when assuring your child that \\"everything will be ok\\" when you   yourself are not so sure. The train station scene is a perfect example of how this movie taps into our emotions, and leaves us feeling completely vulnerable.        Smith incredible in this film, proving to us once again that he deserves his place as one of our most loved actors, but it his son Jaden Smith (who plays Christopher) who shows us that acting definitely runs in the family. He is quickly following in his father's footsteps. Even at a young age he has flawlessly portrayed his role (and he is just so adorable!).     The Pursuit of Happiness gives us all hope; it gives us something to dream for, and something to strive for. It is a great story with amazing acting and a great message. It is completely clean (no swearing, alcohol/drug use, violence or nudity) and it's easy to follow making it a perfect choice for a family movie night or a relaxing evening on the couch.
1439102813|5.0|Alice Howland is a world renowned cognitive psychologist at Harvard University.  At the age of fifty, she suddenly starts forgetting things, getting lost, having trouble thinking of words, etc.  She notices that it's happening too much to be normal, so she goes to her doctor.  After being sent to a neurologist and taking many tests, Alice is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers.    What makes Still Alice such an amazing book is that it's written from Alice's perspective.  You're able to see firsthand the disease's progression.  You're there to see it when she repeats herself and doesn't realize it, you feel her fear when she's lost, you feel her pain when she can't communicate with her family the way she wants.  It's terribly heartbreaking.  I finished this book last night and found myself thinking about it all day today.  It's very powerful and very well written.

0765342294|5.0|At the tender age of six, Ender Wiggin is taken from his home by the military to train.  Ender is a genius and Earth's last hope for survival if a third war with the buggers, aliens that resemble large ants, comes to pass.  The humans were nearly destroyed in the previous two wars.  Their survival was mostly thanks to luck so the military is willing to do anything, even fight the war with a small child in command, to insure Earth's future.    This is an amazing book.  The story is original, the characters are very well drawn, and the author kept me wanting to read way past the time I should have been in bed.  I fell in love with Ender, but I did find it hard to see him as only a child sometimes.  His thought processes were so much more than that of a child, yet at the same time there were moments when he did feel like a child to me.  Those moments when he was isolated from everyone and felt so lonely were heartbreaking.  I wanted to just put my arms around him and give him a hug and yell at the trainers \\"HE'S ONLY A CHILD!!!\\".  Even though I'm not generally a sci-fi fan, I found this to be a wonderful book that I would recommend to anyone.

B002GZQY6Q|4.0|I was hoping for another Fear of a Blank Planet or Deadwing, and am just a little disappointed.  I'm a big Tool fan and discovered Porcupine Tree by Googling \\"bands that sound like Tool.\\"  Given that, I prefer PT's more recent, heavier albums.  On FOABP and Deadwing, I really appreciated Wilson's occasional elevated vocals (for example, on the songs \\"Shallow\\" and \\"Anesthestize\\").  Much of the music on The Incident still tends toward a harder metal sound, but his vocals remain much softer throughout the album.  I find soft vocals juxtaposed by metal much more effective if the vocals eventually transition into a louder, angry climax (like Tool's \\"Vicarious\\").  Unfortuanately, this never happens and it makes the songs feel anti-climatic for me.  Still it's 95% more intelligent than the rest of the junk out there!  I still need to listen to the album many more times b/c PT albums take a long time to fully appreaciate.  Buy this if you like dark, haunting music and are sick of mainstream rock.

The articles appear to be written in the mid to late nineties and covers everything from holidays, to playing with the garbage disposal, to airport security, etc.    I've heard wonderful things about Bill Bryson's books, specifically, how funny they are.  I didn't find this book very funny.  There were a couple of instances when I found myself laughing, for example, when he was talking about his mother's cooking and said they had come to think of saran wrap as a gooey topping on the food, but for the most part, I found the book kind of \\"meh\\".  I did learn a few things though and probably won't count him out because of this one  book.  However, if the next book I read by him is along the same lines, I don't think I'll be rushing out to get another one.

(No pun intended for you Trekies reading this!) I now know there's so many twists and turns in this story you could easily write the proverbial book!<br /><br />The end is ironic because it brings up a lot of important issues I can't discuss without spoiling the movie. It really catches you off guard on so many different levels! I even now have an insight into an old friend I haven't seen in many years, who behaved in a similar fashion to Mr. Whitacre.<br /><br />I think it's important to keep in mind that the real story is ADM (Archer Daniels Midland) (no pun intended again for you Trekies starting to put two and two together!) an incredibly powerful transnational corporation that cost the world's consumers billions of dollars. We get to see at the very end of  The Informant what happened to all the key players. It's very troubling, indeed. The Supreme Court ruled in the 19th century that corporations have many of the rights of a living, breathing person.

0316096199|5.0|After I had gone through some intense emotions over my rape experience, a friend suggested I read this book. The first chapter was very difficult to get through. I was able to picture it all very vividly, and it brought back some memories of my experience that I thought that I had forgotten. Somehow, even though I was crying, I was able to get through that first chapter.     The first chapter goes into great detail about a black stranger who drags her into a tunnel under an outdoor theatre in Syracuse and rapes her, leaving her to walk back to her dorm alone and get help. This book is about the long court process and her recovery.     Part of rape therapy is writing a story about your experience. This book shows a woman who had (and still has) a great deal of strength. She says in her book (and also on the back cover) \\"you save yourself or you remain unsaved\\".     This book left me with a better understanding of my emotions about my experience after hearing similar feelings from someone else.     If you can get through the first chapter, I would totally recommend this book.

How can you beat full color maps, current, relevant theological notes, amazing layout... it's all in the description above. I know Francis Chan uses it at his church. John Piper says, \\"The ESV satisfies the preaching, memorizing, studying, and reading needs of our church, from children to adults. We are building all of our future ministry around it.\\" The translation is really the best of both worlds. The English Standard Version (ESV) Bible is a new, essentially literal Bible translation that combines word-for-word precision and accuracy with literary excellence, beauty, and depth of meaning.<br /><br />But get THIS version of the ESV to take full advantage of all of the features.

This causes devastating revenge by the monster's ruthlessly vindictive, but beautiful mother. Beowulf becomes King and then dies while fighting a dragon.<br /><br />Beowulf is a challenge to interpret into something commercial that all will enjoy.  Artistic license was taken and some parts of the original poem were changed.  The movie honors the poem in many ways, and reveals respect for the time of heroes. Some parts do not match the poem at all, but you give the writer's creative credit for trying.

The last two are the only ones thus far that I did not care for, but others seemed to like them. The rest, especially the biscotti and meltaways were awesome. Tonight, I try the rum raisin cookies...<br /><br />I have read some of the reviews of this book saying that most of the recipes are the same ones over and over. For those of you who have or will recieve this book, Ms. Stewart points out that most cookie recipes contain the same base elements -- butter, milk, eggs, flour, etc. When you add different flavors, you will get different cookies. Any one who bakes should know this. Add several other ingredients and you will get a totally different textured cookies. Take away an ingredient or two and yet again, another texured cookie. As consumers and bakers we expect this from every type of edible food. This book, nor any other, is any different.<br /><br />This cookie book is simple and beautiful. Also delicious... the Cookies, not the Book :) I highly recommend.

Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Along the way, he meets the air cavalry commander Lt. Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall) whose biggest concern is not fighting for democracy in Vietnam but good surfing. On the other hand, the motley crew of Williard's boat are unable to handle the stress of combat and completely lose it at more than one point, with tragic results. Two of the army outposts that Williard and his support crew pass through are in complete chaos with no commanding officer to be found. An American photographer the group encounters upriver (Dennis Hopper, in the role of his career) has been so overpowered by the circumstances that he can only babble nonsense. Coppola repeatedly underscored the irrationality and senselessness of war. Once Col. Kurtz appears, it is revealed that the calculated tactics necessary to overcome this senselessness are even more appalling.<br /><br />Coppola shot far more footage than he could ever fit into a traditional Hollywood film, prompting him to supplement the original cut of the film with a Redux version in 2001 with 49 minutes of never-before-seen material. I've never felt completely satisfied with either version. In the original cut, Williard is an emotionless killing machine, but the Redux version fleshes out the protagonist's internal conflict of moral law versus animal instinct by giving him some moments of humanity, such as prankishly stealing Col. Kilgore's surfboard and setting his men up with some women they encounter. On the other hand, the Redux version brings in far too much extra, such as the tiresome debate amongst French plantation owners about their country's defeat at Dien Bien Phu. APOCALYPSE NOW is a memorable film with many fine performances, but the lack of any truly conclusive edit stops it from really triumphing.<br /><br />People wanting to get a copy of the film would do well to get this Complete Dossier set, as even though it is one of those \\"deluxe collector's editions\\", it is usually fairly economically priced.the film would do well to get this Complete Dossier set, as even though it is one of those \\"deluxe collector's editions\\", it is usually fairly economically priced.
B002FOQXZK|5.0|To say Kid Cudi is the next best rapper in the game is a lie. To say Kid Cudi can save Hip Hop in its slump is a lie. And to even say that this album is revolutionary to Hip Hop is also a lie. BUT, this album IS a small step to Hip Hops rejuvination towards becoming an actual respected genre again. Kid Cudi has actually been around for quite some time, I've heard his song \\"Day n Nite\\" way before the song got overplayed on the radio, this song actually came out late 2007 when I was still a sophomore in High School. Pratically 2 years later and the song became a new hype for people to jock and say they so called \\"heard it first\\" type thing. Kid Cudi's rap style is a little reminicent of Kanye's old style but a lot more wierder, he sing-songs his raps but it works. I have to give it up for the production on this album, its so new and refreshing to hear, its spacey atmosphere full of synths and hard hitting bass is a nice change of pace from the god awful predictable productions in Hip Hop nowadays. This album dares to be different, Kid Cudi's style is a rare find, he isn't your typical rapper when it comes to rapping, he is the type to paint a picture vivid and make you wonder and think about what he is talking about in his lyrics, unlike Lil Wayne which is straight forward attacks with lame metaphors. Man on the Moon: The End of Day is an album that deserves recognition in the music industry, this is the type of music that Hip Hop should be \\"different and intuitive\\". BUY THIS ALBUM<br /><br />Favorite Tracks:<br />1) Soundtrakk 2 My Life - love the beat and Kid Cudi's delivery when he raps. Basically the title tells it all, whether or not it is true, the story is a re-telling of his life as a boy growing up.<br /><br />2) Simple As... - The track is a great catchy upbeat ride. The line \\"Simple As that, Simple As that for ya Simple Ass.\\" may not make sense but in time will be clear as day. Cudi's lyrics are just plain funny, simple as hell but hilarious.<br /><br />3) Day n Nite - the overplayed song everybody should know. This song has actually the most simple produdtion out of the entire album. This may actually be the weakest song on the album, but remains my favorite cuz of the catchy simple beat and also this is the very first track that introduced me to Kid Cudi.<br /><br />4) Up, Up & Away - the final track is the most epic song in my opinion. The production is the most different from the rest of the album, it takes a Coldplay approach with a bumpy beach boy like sample. The lyrics explains Kid Cudi's personality humorously \\"I'll be Up Up & Away, cuz they gon Judge Me Anyway, So, Whatever\\" this shows me the way the only thing the album shows its true motive as an album.

Since the questions in this book were once part of the actual test, you'll know exactly what type of questions to expect when you take your test.    How to Turn the Good to Work:  To make the best use of this book, use it after you undergo a thorough review of all the math concepts. The best source for doing so would be the Kaplan book if you need a quick refresher, or the EZ Solutions GMAT series if you need a thorough review of each and every math concept imaginable.     The Bad:  Although this book has real test questions, the level of difficulty doesn't go too high. If you are specifically aiming for 700+ score, you ought to do a lot more practice question than what you can find in this book. The answer explanations are not that great because of two main reasons. First, the explanations are not clear. Second, sometimes you can find an easier/shorter way to reach the answer. Moreover, don't expect to get any review of any math content in this book.    How to Overcome the Bad:  Like mentioned above, use the EZ Solutions GMAT series for in-depth math review and practicing problems of all level, from basic to advanced. Another great resource would be the Kaplan math workbook to get some additional practice problems.    The Bottom Line:  In spite of the \\"bad's,\\" the \\"good's\\" makes this book a must-have for all GMAT takers. For under $15, you'll get to see real math questions published by the test makers. Before you turn to any other book for practice, this should be your first choice. Of course, like I mentioned earlier, you'll need to seek additional sources for reviewing math concepts and practicing math question.    Final Note:  Whatever your case may be, do not skip this book. I can't stress enough, but if you are preparing for the GMAT, get this book, along with the main Official Guide.    In my opinion, the above is exactly what you will get from this book, not an inch more, not an inch less. I hope my review would help at least a few of you, if not everyone. Thanks for reading. Good luck.
B001R0KH3M|2.0|There ARE positives to this DVD - Stevie is in good voice, his band is very talented and it's clear they're having a heckuva good time.  The problems are the song selection and the pacing.  As others have noted, the setlist leans too heavily on slower and unfamiliar (Wonder hasn't had a Top 40 hit since 1987) numbers that get repetitive after a while.  When he does pull out the hits, they crackle for the most part (if the opening bass line of \\"I Wish\\" doesn't get your toes tapping you might want to check your pulse).  \\"Visions\\" from \\"Innervisions\\" is a nice surprising \\"deep cut\\" from his classic era, but where are \\"That Girl\\" or \\"I Was Made To Love Her\\" or \\"You Haven't Done Nothin'\\" (which could have been 'dedicated' to George W. Bush, thus providing a more coherent social statement than the clumsy Al Gore-isms he throws in instead)?     The biggest problem is that there's just far too much wasted time - about five songs into the set the band just sits on a stagnant vamp forever, and then Stevie whips out a talkbox (remember Peter Frampton's \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\"?) for a pointless and torturous 20-minute \\"medley\\" of \\"London Bridge Is Falling Down\\" and some snippets of Beatles and Rolling Stones hits.  Later, one of the \\"audience participation\\" bits is an overlong call-and-response intro to \\"Part Time Lover\\".  Oh, and Wonder plays harmonica a grand total of TWO times.    My recommendation is to Netflix this one and keep your finger near the \\"Fast Forward\\" button on your remote.

0385504225|5.0|9/19/09 (embedded mystical numbers of course)    Finished the \\"Lost Symbol\\" - all 770 (embedded mystical numbers of course) pages of it!    Think you'll like it very much. A real page turner.   Ah, the joys of turning those pages late into the night.    Cleverly created story.    Have read all of Dan Brown's books.   Enjoy seeing his storytelling craft develop.    Did I read the same book as the people giving it a poor review?    This was my favorite.    Anthony's Bobby, word evolutionist
B00005QDW1|5.0|Re-write on March 20th, 2013<br /><br />If you got the chance to read my original review on this disc I was less enthusiastic about it back in 2009. Now I've listened to it recently (March 2013) and everything changed. Here's the review I wanted to post on Rdio's website but couldn't for still unknown reasons. Stay with me. High praise is coming.<br /><br />I can't start this review any other way: This is No Doubt's most underrated album of all time! It's a really popular album and has some of their biggest hits on it to date like \\"Hey Baby\\", \\"Hella Good\\" and \\"Underneath It All\\" but in reality I think the feelings on this album by the fans are really split. I caved initially giving the album a mere 3.3 star rating and calling it a \\"mixed bag\\" basically. But pulling it out and listening to it again after so long two days ago (after thinking I gave it to a friend to keep) made me see the light. This album is genius. It's No Doubt's most upbeat album to date and in most spots is very dance-y. However, it is still completely injected with Gwen's relationship issues to make the album that much crazier. Genre wise, it's a lot of pop, some dance, some pop rock and there's even a track with Prince that's more R&B-infused. It's called \\"Waiting Room\\". Although that track has its appeal (the Prince appearance works and his voice compliments Gwen's) it's still my least favorite on the album.<br /><br />\\"Start The Fire\\" fares a little better and has a killer sound towards the end but otherwise is a little cheesy. Other than that I really love all the tracks. This album is something special and it's funny how I saw a lot of the tracks as filler before. I admit that this album won't be enjoyed by everyone because there are some repetitive qualities about a lot of the tracks (choruses repeated ad nauseum). But the awesome production, insightful lyrics and Gwen's vocal delivery on most of the tracks (mainly the verses and on some bridges) keep this album ahead of the pack.<br /><br />Before I talk about my favorite tracks I'm going to say I used to favor \\"Return Of Saturn\\" as their best work. Not so anymore. While both albums are great they are very, very different. \\"Return...\\" comes off as more emotional because you can take the beats more seriously and they were kind of dramatic with the combination of the honest, heartfelt lyrics. But this album is just more fun and dance-y.<br /><br />OK. My all-time favorite track from this album was \\"Underneath It All\\" for the longest time but track #6 has bumped it a little lower into spot #2. \\"Detective\\" is said track and I find that it really has a great feel to it production-wise while showing some of Gwen's deepest relationship insecurities inside. I am also quite partial to the short bridge in the song that shows off Gwen's voice in an addicting manner. The track is repetitive in spots but the repetition works. The \\"peek in's\\" in the song are really funny towards the end because you know that Gwen is looking through her man's closet trying to find dirt on him. The song just works. \\"Underneath It All\\" is the next standout with its killer lyrics about love, amazingly laid-back production, useful feature from the necessary Lady Saw and (probably most importantly) the absolutely stunning bridge which contains the album's most loving lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Hella Good\\", the first official song on the album is very vibe-y too and I love it. Initially when it came out I didn't \\"get it\\" but I love the lyrics and the production is on fire. \\"Hey Baby\\" while slightly annoying is also a good track. One of the catchiest songs on the album it's just fun to hear and even easier to sing along to. \\"Running\\" is another standout which stands out as the album's only ballad. It's a gorgeous song if I do say so myself but it is also one of the tracks that contains some computer \\"bleeps\\" and \\"bloops\\" in production and could possibly be a turn off to some. However, there's a lot of sentiment there. And again the bridge (although too short once more) is to die for where all you hear is Gwen sincerely coo a few \\"do, do, do's\\" and say \\"the fuuuuuuture.\\"<br /><br />Although almost every track is a standout here I'll just touch on one more track. \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" a fun, bouncy track is one I gobble up every time. It's a cute song and is up there with \\"Hey Baby\\" as the album's most upbeat and carefree sounding material. The production is again a true highlight. Another of my favorite parts of the song is the chorus where Gwen spits, \\"So don't blow it/even a little bit/'cause now you're all mine/don't you forget it.\\"<br /><br />Basically (by an inch), this is No Doubt's magnum opus. Come here if you want fun sounds and want to get up and shake your ass. Pull out \\"Return Of Saturn\\" if you want to reflect. That's No Doubt's somber record.<br /><br />4.5 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Detective\\"<br />\\"Underneath It All\\"<br />\\"Don't Let Me Down\\"<br />\\"Running\\" &<br />\\"In My Head\\"ugh too short once more) is to die for where all you hear is Gwen sincerely coo a few \\"do, do, do's\\" and say \\"the fuuuuuuture.\\"<br /><br />Although almost every track is a standout here I'll just touch on one more track. \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" a fun, bouncy track is one I gobble up every time.

B000V86OKG|5.0|Notice that most of the low reviews are from people who don't know how to use Amazon properly and are rating the sellers.<br />That is because almost everyone who sees this show falls in love with it!!<br />Dark, yet funny, Dexter is one of the best shows on TV. I wish the DVD had a \\"play all\\" or subtitle feature, but with such great content on my screen I can hardly complain with the small amount of extra effort needed to watch it. Micheal C Hall is such a great actor, and Dexter is a masterpiece!

B000002MIF|5.0|Hatful of Hollow being a compilation album that spanns the years 1983-1984. I agree with another reviewer that this is landmark release as the quality of the tracks is astounding. Here we have my all time favourite Smiths track \\"How Soon Is Now\\" along with other great tracks such as  \\"This Charming Man\\", \\"Hand in Glove\\" and \\"William it was really nothing\\". The booklet is very nice with all the lyrics included and many very nice photographs. 5/5.

B00009V2ND|5.0|I had the unexpected pleasure of meeting Gene Kranz in person and talking with him very briefly during the celebration of the 40th anniversary of Apollo 8 in San Diego last winter. I already knew from his book that his rather forbidding appearance is just a facade, but I was still surprised at how approachable he was. I also had the chance to talk briefly with a few astronauts, but meeting Kranz was still the night's highlight for me.    What impressed me most about Kranz's book, aside from his very straightforward and no-nonsense writing style, was the importance he placed on giving credit to others, especially those he felt hadn't been properly recognized over the years. Near the top of his list were the training and simulation supervisors.    Kranz talks quite candidly about those seemingly endless training sessions. He freely admits that they often had him pouring out sweat. Many got the better of him, such as his decision to abort a launch that came so late that the capsule landed on a mountain taller than the altitude at which the parachutes opened, killing the \\"crew\\". Sometimes he even wondered if he was up to the job of flight director. (I'd be far more concerned about anyone who didn't have those doubts.)    The story of Steve Bales' \\"go\\" call that saved the Apollo 11 landing is legendary, but I never knew the *reason* for Bales' correct call until Kranz wrote about it. In the very last training session before the flight, Simulation Supervisor Dick Koos simulated those very same computer overload alarms. Bales called an unnecessary abort. Kranz had Bales and his team go through the entire list of computer alarm codes and prepare a response for each one. So when the alarm happened for real, he was ready. (When the call came, someone on the flight controller's loop says: \\"Yeah, it's the same one we had!\\") Some might just consider this lucky, and Kranz himself toys with the notion. But I can't think of many better examples of the principle that luck always favors the prepared.

0312360266|5.0|I LOVE reading anything relating to vampires and the supernatural/paranormal.  I have read the entire Twilight series, Sookie Stackhouse series, and many other vampire novels.  I noticed many people comparing these to Twilight, etc.  No, this isn't at all like Twilight, but yes I loved the 1st three books I have read in the series.  Marked started off a little slow.  I wasn't at all sure if I was going to like it, but somewhere in the middle it took off and I couldn't put it down.  I finished Marked in 1 day just so I could start the next book the following day.  Everyone has an opinion.  My opinion is that I enjoyed the first 3 books and have the next 2 books ordered and I cannot wait to start reading them.
B001PR0YFS|4.0|If you want to see The Informant based solely on the movie trailers, you might think it is a strange comedy about a man who helps the government take down the company he works for. (That's kind of what I thought it would be.) It is quite a bit more than that. The Informant is in part a comedy and in part a rollercoasting drama that finds its audience constantly guessing the next step. Is Mark Whitacre going to help the FBI take down Fortune 500 company ADM by exposing a price-fixing scandal? Or is the FBI going to help take down Mark Whitacre for some things they discovered on their own? Like the main character of Mark Whitacre, The Informant is more than what is gleaned on first appearance and what starts as one plot quickly turns into another before you know it.     While I liked The Informant, it felt disjointed for several reasons. First, in retrospect the story seems an odd one to inject comedy into and, while Matt Damon did a fantastic job with the comedic bits, I think the film could have more effectively been a crime drama. (I understand that the filmmakers were trying to show how preposterous some of Whitacer's missteps were, but think that some of the more comedic bits were just out of place.) I also think the film's disjointed feel can be pinned on the imbalance between its being set in the nineties while using a Marvin Hamlisch \\"elevator music\\" score and other film techniques that seem to channel the '60's.) At any rate, some of these directorial choices were, at least to me, questionable and often detracted from the film's story.     Aside from these things, I did find myself quite liking The Informant. The film did a good job at portraying the many sides of its main character, Mark Whitacer, and the strange events that surrounded - or were instigated by - him. The script and pacing of the story keeps the audience intrigued but guessing, only gradually revealing each new secret. The script was very focused and forward moving.     Definitely reccomendedfor those who like off-beat films like[[ASIN:B001JIE7JC Burn After Reading]], that straddle the fence between quirky drama and comedy.
B000VZPBNU|5.0|I may be a fan of metal, but that does'nt mean I don't appreciate the classics, and Jimi happens to be my favorite. Despite the fact that he wrote 99% of these songs stoned, his music can not only be catchy, but have some pretty deep meaning to them, and his legendary guitar skills complement nicely with these lyrics. The top five songs I recomend are:    1. Voodoo Child  2. Hey Joe  3. Little Wing  4. Fire  5. Wind Cries Mary
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is my fave show right now, besides Gumby ; ) I was afraid that the show might've gotten cheaper writers or just ran out of funny things to show by the time they made the second season but it made me laugh harder--worth ur money!!!!
B001VVZ7Y6|5.0|I'm a fairley new bullet fan, and so far they have not dissapointed at all. This album contains some of the most awesome, powerful, heavy, and overall truelly epic tracks ever created! \\"Her Voice Resides\\", \\"4 Words\\", and \\"Spit You Out\\" are easilly the best tracks on the album(in my opinion). Any metal and/or screamo fan should'nt pass this up at all!
B001CTDH4Y|3.0|Disney's \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" is based on one time-tested formula of a classic story about a faithful pet coming back to the owner, and other animals walking and talking and occasionally saying something stupid - like Scooby-Doo. It night be helpful for you to know that \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" is directed by Raja Gosnell, who did two live-action \\"Scooby-Doo\\" films recently.     The opening of \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" is weak, but later it gets better. In a very contrived setup, Chloe (voiced by Drew Barrymore), a Chihuahua too accustomed to luxurious lifestyle (provided by her rich owner Viv, played by Jamie Lee Curtis) gets lost in Mexico. With a help from a lonely German Shepherd with a past (voiced by Andy Garcia) Chloe tries to travel back to LA, but their journey, as it turns out, are full of adventures and challenges.     This is a Disney innocuous comic adventure movie. Most probably Chloe's fate would have been so much worse in real life (a Chihuahua in a dog fight?), but the film is made for entertainment and maybe we should keep that in mind. Still, some characters (humans especially) are just impossible. Piper Perabo plays Viv's niece Rachel, who is so careless and irresponsible at first. Then, after 15 minutes or so, she becomes a completely different person (with different makeup), looking for her aunt's missing Chihuahua. In the film dogs and other animals are better actors than humans for the most of the scenes. In fact, actions involving animals are well-done against the nice backdrop of Mexico.    I myself find the film is not so bad as some reviewers claim though it is nothing original either (except one scene where you can see a pack of mighty Chihuahuas) .It is a blend of the famous story \\"Lassie Come Home\\" (or \\"The Incredible Journey) and a titular \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua.\\" A light-hearted family picture, which is shallow, but still entertaining.
059305427X|3.0|Once again Dan Brown serves up his action-filled mix of mysticism and science as symbologist Robert Langdon tracks down the evil-doer who has kidnapped his friend and mentor Peter Solomon, leader of the Masons in Washington, DC. This time Langdon's quest is on American soil and instead of the Catholic Church the secret institution is the Order of Masons.    We learn how the nation's capital is filled with mystical symbols and sacred buildings.    The action is fast-paced and I look forward to seeing the film with Tom Hanks. But this book has a few flaws. For one thing, the CIA is involved because of a potential revelation that could have catastrophic implications for national security. Only when the secret is revealed, it just isn't that terrible. The nation and the world could survive just fine. But the whole book centers around the CIA story, which just seems a bit silly in the end.    The Masons are treated extremely well, much better than the Catholic Church in previous Dan Brown books. Not only do they come across as benign and much misunderstood, with many Masons being involved in the founding of the United States and Washington, DC itself, and continuing to hold positions of power today. But the key Masons in the story are constantly lecturing to Robert Langdon, telling our hero the Truth. Langdon doesn't really uncover a secret, the Masons just tell him. When the Big Secret is uncovered, the Masons already knew.    Worst of all, when the action-packed climax has happened, the final chapters, when the secrets of the Ancient Mysteries are revealed to us, are just plain boring, as are those Hidden Truths.    One nice message for Americans out of touch with their country's history, is how the Founding Fathers were Deists rather than Christians. This might come as a considerable surprise to fundamentalist Christians today, along with this book's basic message that all religions lead to the same Divinity, which is in us all. And that science is a tool for discovering the divinity within us.    Brown's message is one many fundamentalists around the world need to hear. Hopefully in following the face-paced action, they will also hear the message.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|\\"Endgame\\" finds Megadeth mastermind Dave Mustaine once again going back to his roots, and once again as a result, he has crafted a spectacular album that ranks among not only the best of Megadeth's catalog, but among the very best that modern metal music has to offer today.  Opening instrumental \\"Dialectic Chaos\\" is a rip-roaring, turbo-charged track that you cannot help but love from the first time you hear it.  \\"This Day We Fight!\\", \\"Head Crusher\\", and the elecrtic title track are masterworks as well, featuring the best elements of old school thrash metal and some incredible riffs to boot.  \\"Endgame\\" isn't quite as politically charged as \\"United Abominations\\" or \\"The System Has Failed\\", which may be a plus or minus depending on your personal taste, but in either case, \\"Endgame\\" blows away anything that Megadeth has released in the past decade, and by all means, we should all be glad that it does.  This is real, pure metal folks.  This is Megadeth.
B001UW58WW|5.0|This CD is great. We discovered it by accident on P.B.S. My 1 year old grandson likes to play with the TV remote and put on the concert on P.B.S. He fell in love with the music and just sat and watched. Now that we have the CD we play the music all the time and the whole family enjoys it. We are traditionally a clasic rock family so we enjoy the combination of clasical music with rock songs.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Great writing with lots of new twists, never boring..can't wait for the new season starting September 27th!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I loved this movie!!  I watched it over a series of nights.  Each night, I fell asleep going over it in my mind.  Trying to figure it all out.  It keeps you guessing right to the end.  Fantastic story, fantastic acting!  I highly recommend it.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. Read and loved the Da Vinci Code but this one is so incredibly bad. You have to suspend belief about the plot and the CIA's involvement. Hope in another 6 years he comes up with a better book.
B00005NMVP|5.0|Al Stewart probably has about 30 albums, but you wouldn't know it because that album of \\"Year of the Cat\\" is, by far, his most recognized album.  I love the title track, but my favorite songs are \\"On the Border\\" and \\"One Stage Before\\".<br /><br />This is one of those albums that never sound outdated.  In fact, it brings up warm feelings of being a teenager again when life was so much easier than what today's teen's have today.  Today's kid's are immersed with so much technology (cell phones, I-pods, computers, computer games), that they wouldn't understand how simple and stress-free our lives were as teens back in the seventies.<br /><br />....Oops, sorry, I drifted there.  It's just that albums like this one brings up great memories.  Anyway, this album from Al Stewart was produced by Alan Parsons even before the Alan Parsons Project was recognized.  This Al Stewart album was released just before Alan Parson's \\"I Robot\\" which was his most famous album rivaled possibly by his 1982 album \\"Eye in the Sky\\".  Alan Parsons even participated in producing the Beatles \\"Abbey Road\\" album, so you know that he's a major contributor to making classic albums even before his own album repertoire began.  Just for fun, I'll also mention that Alan Parsons produced \\"Magic\\" by Pilot too.<br /><br />\\"Time Passages\\" was a great follow-up to this album and, of course, Al's had other mild hits.  And I'm sure that he has great songs on all his released albums.  It's just a shame that they didn't get promoted as much as they should have been.  On an earlier seventies album \\"Past, Present, and Future\\", his songs \\"Nostradamus\\", and \\"Roads to Moscow\\" were classic progressive folk rock staples.  The man is an over-looked genius.<br /><br />I've got the Rhino remastered version of \\"Year of the Cat\\" which sounds great compared to the limited edition Mobile Fidelity CD that I sold for about $150 a few years ago.  I really wonder if that CD was worth $150.  I also sold my limited edition Mobile Fidelity CD of Alan Parsons Project's \\"I Robot\\" for well over a hundred dollars too.  The 2007 re-master of that CD sounds much better too.ject's \\"I Robot\\" for well over a hundred dollars too.  The 2007 re-master of that CD sounds much better too.

B00005JKNF|5.0|I think I've watched this film 7 times because it's so delicious. The plot of who killed the lord of the manor is secondary to the characters and the subplots. Everybody (all portrayed by legendary actors) had an agenda except the dog. I loved it because it was so opposite the typical Hollywood formula with the typical English estate and the cliche murder mystery weekend. Great script and character development. There were scenes at the dinners where everyone was talking at once, and key people were featured as you, the viewer caught snippets of their conversations. Just a masterpiece, but different from the wonderful Masterpiece Theatre.
0385504225|3.0|It does not take very many pages of \\"The Lost Symbol\\" to realize you have experienced this plot before.   Much of it is like \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" with some \\"National Treasure\\" included. Robert Langdon seems to be unable to  escape from the \\"Groundhog Day\\" nature of his life. He keeps doing the same things, with a few new faces, and a different location.     This book deals with the Masons, and their secrets. Langdon, of course, is wise and intelligent. He understands that  everyone is a bit odd, and if you get in the other fellow's shoes, you can understand what he holds sacred.   Not a bad philosophy, really, if its applied wisely.  You have to give Dan Brown credit for tolerance.     The first half of the book is best.  The plot holds together fairly well until the last half of the book. Then, it spins out of control, and becomes much less enjoyable.  Still, it held me, and made me want to see how it would end.     I always marvel at the incredible energy of Dan Brown's characters. Their adventures take place in a very short period of time. They suffer terror, hot pursuits, and the constant need to elude villains and the law.  While doing this, they do not, apparently, need to go to the bathroom, eat, or fall asleep.    I got a chuckle at the end when one of the characters---Peter Solomon----who has had his hand cut off, and has been at death's door, suddenly finds the energy to drive Langdon around Washington D.C. in an SUV.  It is an amazing example of healing.     And I must add one more thing. Once again, Langdon is the king of platonic relationships. The girl is his, or could be, but he lets her go. One cannot help but wish that when it is all over, Langdon would do something with the girl.   Hey, after what he has been through, he, and the reader, deserve it.     The villain is a truly awful fellow, and his identity is hidden until the end of the novel. His reptilian nature, and  creepy ways are quite engaging. He is a guy you love to hate, and you would behorrified to meet him.    Its not a great book, but it is readable diversion. I had fun with it, and it kept me wanting to learn how it would end.   You can do worse than that.

0385504225|2.0|I believe that all books should be \\"read\\" first on tape before they are published so the editors can pick up on illogical or just stupid writing!  The book on CD is very short, 5 CD's.    Amazing how Langdon flies to Washington, prepares for a big speach, yet isn't greeted by anyone before he enters into the lecture hall?    And, these supposed high tech, secure labs, being accessed with a swipe card and PIN?  No biometric or retinal scan?  Come on.  Who could have a conversation with Robert Langdon, he's always spouting some long diatribe.    The best part was the character of Peter Simon.  He was kidnapped, mutilated, put in sensory deprivation, yet he requires no doctor and can take the time to explain to Peter the meaning of it all?  There is one part where the book reads \\" Peter put his hand on Langdon's shoulder\\", what, did he put the bloody stump on his shoulder?  When Peters sister flies out to the house where the security company supposedly finds him in \\"bad shape\\", why don't they notice there is no ambulance outside?      I could go on.  I ended up yelling at the end of Angels and Demon's too.  Unbelievable stuff when you \\"hear\\" it.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|after reaching lowpoint with risk(like it by the way),megadeth continue getting better with each release. don't know why some people think in order to give this a good review the have to rip metallica though. no matter what you may think of metallica, it in no way makes this release any better or any worse for that matter. this is the best from megadeth in a while and stands completely on it's on.It's definitely a much thrashier album than the band has released in quite some time, which, for me at least, is a good thing. As with 'Death Magnetic' by Metallica and 'Christ Illusion' by Slayer this sounds like a band rediscovering it's roots. Mustaine has obviously been revisiting his classic albums from the Eighties and early Nineties.
0385504225|2.0|This book is disappointing at best. If you've read The DaVinci Code or Angels and Demons, look for the same plot line. All the books start out with something dead on the floor (a body or hand) that point to something that only our distinguished hero can decipher. There is absolutely no love interest between the hero and heroine and other than mutual admiration for their intellect, the chemistry falls flat. The villans are either albinos (DaVinci Code) or tatooed men (Lost Symbol) and the cast of other characters read from something out of a side show at the circus.<br /><br />After all the hype--joining Dan Brown's fan club on Facebook with fantastic ciphers (thanks guys!), reading all the pre-sale articles and waiting for September 15 to come around, I was let down. Granted, it was a quick read (6 hours is about right), and one chapter lead to the next (couldn't put it down), I really was hoping for a better ending.<br /><br />The DaVinci Code started me on a 3-year journey and quest for TRUTH. But this book was NOT the answer I was looking for. Maybe having more questions and wanting to search for more information is really what this book does in the end.<br /><br />If you've never read Dan Brown, this book is good. If you have read him, read this anyway and judge for yourself.<br /><br />The Truth Lies Within Each of Us.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|I found myself recently getting into Queens of the Stone Age.  Songs for the Deaf was my first purchase, followed by Era Vulgaris.  I passed Lullabies since I wasn't very familiar with it.  Little Sister got some air time, but the song wasn't anything too spectacular in my mind.<br /><br />By the time I finally picked up the album I was already hooked to the band.  By the time I finished listening to this album for the 8th or 9th time they propelled into my top 10.  Simply put, Lullabies is the best and most complete Queens album I have experienced thus far.<br /><br />What does it for me is the way that each song feels connected to the rest of the album.  Lullabies definitely has the most cohesion out of the bands' most recent three albums.  That's not to say that each song sounds the same though, but rather they all belong together on one disc.<br /><br />Also, there are more quality songs on Lullabies than other albums.  Although everyone has different preferences, I can safely say that the first ten tracks are worth your time, though track one is more of a moody intro to the album.  The latter portion of these ten tracks begins to dip into Prog territory (tracks 8, 9 and 10 are 6:10 long on average), but it's a welcome change.  In fact, \\"I Never Came\\" and \\"Someone's in the Wolf\\" (8 and 9) are two of the best Queens songs I've ever heard.<br /><br />Overall there is a good mix of music here, but it's all balanced very well.  The lyrics are interesting, the music is intoxicating and the ambiance is perfect.  If you haven't already, purchase this album and get lost in it for the next few months.<br /><br />9/10
B000YAA68C|5.0|I love this movie...it is heart warming and fun. A good mixture of emotions.  Recommend it!
0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown is living off the reputation of his last book.  I found very little mystery and a large serving of muddled thinking regarding religion and mankind.  Read this book if you must and I hope you are not as disappointed as I was.
0805028846|5.0|I was tentative about buying this based on other reviews here, because I had never made pop-ups before, or even done very much paper cutting, but wanted to learn advanced techniques. This book is great because it shows the basics without spoon-feeding you; instead of giving precise patterns or instructions to be printed or copied, this book shows simple diagrams that explain only the necessary components to make the pop-up work, like which cuts/folds need to be the same size as others, where certain folds should be in relation to edges, and so on, so they can be applied to any shape and size of paper or pop-up. When I first opened the book and looked at the gallery of examples, I was daunted, especially when I compared them to the first few step-by-step examples. But I've found that I can figure out and replicate most of the designs that use the methods I've used so far, and I'm hopeful that by the time I work my way through the whole book I'll be able to more or less duplicate every example in the gallery. I've already been able to implement some of my own designs from some of the most basic techniques in this book, and I'm hopeful about continuing to create my own pop-up work.<br /><br />Simply put, if your goal is to actually master the skills involved rather than simply to produce the designs pictures, this book is a wonderful tool, visually inspiring and formally instructive. Being math-minded might help somewhat, but not in the sense of understanding specific measurements of lengths and angles. Being visually-minded is probably a batter match for this book.<br /><br />One reviewer mentioned that there are no specific instructions for the dove picture on the cover. This is true. However, all of the techniques necessary for creating it are in very early pages of the book. I was able to recreate the dove within the first hour of working from the book.
1439157383|4.0|I am so happy the ending is different from the movie!!! The book really shows you each character and goes deep just like all of Piccoult's books do. I still rate The 10th Circle as my favorite to date!
B00005OCMR|4.0|My husband really likes this movie and we were waiting for Disney's prices to go down to buy it (yeah, right!), when I decided to look online to see if prices were better.  They really were better. Thanks for helping me surprise my husband!  He watched the movie the night we received it in the mail.  It is in good condition and we received it promtly.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I discovered Dexter a couple months ago. After being told by everyone who had ever seen it that I should watch it, I caved.<br /><br />Dexter is a serial killer with a code, a girlfriend coming out of an abusive relationship with two kids, a sister with a swearing habit and a shady history that torments and intrigues both the audience and Dexter himself.<br /><br />The cast is terrific. Michael C. Hall plays a scary, naive, troubled and charming blood spatter expert with ease. Jennifer Carpenter plays his sister Debra, a foul-mouthed cop who craves respect. Julie Benz as Rita, a parent coming out of an abusive relationship makes the tender side of Dexter contrary and fascinating in light of what he does when he's not with her.<br /><br />C.S. Lee is by far the funniest character, as forensic expert Vince Masuka. He only gets funnier as the show hums along. David Zayas is the down on his luck in love Angel Baptista, a warm and caring cop with a badass side who may end up as a favorite character for many. Lauren Velez is Maria Laguerta, the lieutenant of the force who battles to hold onto her power and struggles to decide if she's a cop or a politician.<br /><br />There's a lot more, but just watch it.
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|\\"Inglorious Basterds\\" is very misleading, proving that Quentin Tarantino really does know how to pull off a prank or two: what one expects is a full-on action extravaganza, but instead gets a bitingly, intricately grandiose Shakespearean play, dealing with Nazism, however fantastical, loyalty, revenge, forbidden love, cultural mishmash and, what foreign language lovers like me will consider golden - linguistic plasticity.     A lot of reviewers, casual and professionals alike, have already commented what is there to comment about this magnificent film, but few has really touched upon the film's musical stance on language. Tarantino is a very clever and erudite writer, though at times very self-indulgent, but I suppose that is only the hallmarks of his genuine passion and talent for creating dialogues that flow like river that reaches to no end. This film greatly emphasizes, especially by virtue of Christoph Waltz, who is a complete shock to the system thanks to his Oscar-winning performance as a paradoxically lovable but utterly evil and sadistic Hans Landa, that words are just as pointedly dangerous as a mad Nazi's angry bullet.     Tarantino's words glide, waltz and dance, continuously in such fervent blaze, and ever so gloriously through the maddening syntactical landscape of foreign territories, at times not for the sake of sneakily showing off cultural and social superiority, but as necessity, on the basis of life and death, to deal with enemies as stealthily and efficiently as possible. Words, in other words, bad pun unintended, are tools, like the aforementioned angry bullet: a mispronounced word, an accent, or even any semantical byproducts of spoken words could result into a decapitated head. For example, the basement tavern scene involving the Basterds and actress-turned-spy Bridget von Hammersmark trying not to blow their cover, in the face of an increasingly suspecting German soldier, is a perfect example of a harrowing tense cinematic scene, dripped with dread and suspense, all in the name of linguistic interaction. Who needs guns when you have German, French, even Italian?
B001PR0YGC|4.0|In 1992 Mark Whitacre, the President of Bio-Product division of ADM (powerful Fortune 500 company), became the highest ranking executive EVER to turn whistle blower. For three years he helped the FBI gather evidence of a multinational conspiracy to control the price of lysine. As a result, US government collected hundreds of millions of dollars in fines from ADM and foreign corporations, followed by prison sentences for three executives. These are events in real life as well as the movie. However, according to the opening credits, the film is not intended as a documentary and does depart from real life facts... The final, cheeky line of the prologue: \\"So there!\\", gives us a hint that, though the topic and the consequences suffered by many in this story are somber, what we are about to see is meant to amuse and entertain, as well as educate...<br /><br />As promised, the chuckles do come often, but their source is not your typical one liners. Matt Damon is Whitacre, an inspired choice for the role. His plump, mustachioed and toupeed character comes across so harmless and ordinary you never question why his actions go undetected; even as his concealed recording equipment loudly malfunctions during a covert multinational executive meeting! You laugh at the bewilderment of FBI agents and the DA's office as they are led by the nose by Whitacre's increasingly outlandish antics. One could say \\"The Informant!\\" has the educational quality of an Aesop's fable: blinded by their desire to swallow a tasty morsel (ADM), the agents cross their fingers and fail to run even the most basic checks on their informant; checks that would immediately reveal inconsistencies in his stories (such as the true nature of his parentage, for example).<br /><br />The film is not perfect. Based on the way it was being advertised, I expected something in the same category as \\"The Pink Panther\\". In reality, one would not be wrong to describe it as a combination of \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", \\"The Insider\\", and \\"The Duck Soup\\" (Marx Brothers). Sadly, \\"The Informant!\\" never quite becomes as touching, thrilling and funny as those films were, respectively. The makers allow it to drag on a bit in the second half as Whitacre's behaviour becomes absurd. The logical explanation for it all arrives only after our initial keen interest has already begun to dissipate. I also hear some grumblings about the film's muted lighting. Since most of the action takes place in offices and hotels, I believe the lighting is true to reality. Anyone who has spent at least one work day in a cubicle, understands how oppressive that atmosphere can be. Despite these possible faults, Whitacre's story and Damon's performance make \\"The Informant!\\" worthy of at least one theater trip. Depending on your personal approach, you will see a funny thriller or... a thrilling comedy. Either way, expect to be entertained!<br /><br />PS: BRAVO! to the filmmakers for sticking to a relatively modest budget ($21 mil)! I am sick of paying to see worthless films with budgets that could bankrupt the economy of a small country.oup\\" (Marx Brothers).

0385504225|1.0|Little did I know that Dan Brown would be able to actually write a worse book than Digital Fortress, but here it is. The main \\"plot\\" is stupefyingly, indescribably idiotic and could be summarized in a single sentence; the rest are pointless asides and clunky, repetitive descriptions interspersed with flashbacks and \\"stunning\\" revelations the reader sees coming from hundreds of miles (or pages) away. Second worst book I've ever read; avoid at all cost.
0767817478|4.0|I enjoy to classify movies to genres, this one, I suggest it to be a disaster movie. For a horror, usually the monster is only at the most the size of a dinosaur. This one, with the size of maybe the Statue of Liberty, is too large to be a monster, better say it's a disaster.  You know Hollywood movies always raise new suspense again and again. So in this movie, it first make many baby godzillas, and for the baby godzillas, it's maybe only a horror singly, but there are so many, in total they are still a disaster. Finally they are destroyed by the air force. Then it makes the seemingly dead old godzilla alive again. Surely there is a continuous fight for this.  It is said that the godzilla was mutated by radiation, so that's the point, people should always be careful that their new inventions can harm themselves.
B000002GKT|5.0|Simply one of the greatest live rock albums from one of the greatest live bands! Saw them a bunch of times. You were never cheated at a Humble Pie show; they just kept on driving. Bought this album when it was first released. Still listen to it.
B0025KVLRO|1.0|The remastering is excellent. I was shocked. The package is gorgeous also. Compared this to the 2006 American and still sounds more cleaned up. Wow. (That being said, it's not mixed at all! The vocals are completely on one side and the drums on the other. Again, it's not mixed at all! Rubber Soul is at least slightly mixed. I have to change my original review. Mix the album as it was never meant for stereo anyway. The Beatles never partaked in the mixing and it was never meant to be released as a stereo record per George Martin. The arrogance of these people. I thought the music is for a new generation of listeners. At first listen it does sound amazing, but then I realized it wasn't mixed at all. Anyone, who tells you differently is special. Purchase the mono box and get blown away with a proper mix! You also won't get errors that weren't meant to be there! For example, track 2 on a Hard Days Night the harmonica has a mistake on it when John runs out of breath. Track 3 Pauls voice cracks! Yes, they kept these mistakes in for the stereo records! Isn't that great. When you listen to the mono you get correct mixes as well as no left right vocals and drums problems. Hard Days Night still sounds amazing, but these problems should have been mixed out.
9626343532|5.0|Timmons does a first rate job of reading, word for word, these classic texts. He does different character voices and he's consistent over the entire work. Amazing that it took him ten years to read it all. Also amazing that in \\"A Scandal In Bohemia,\\" I thought I was hearing things when Timmons would read a line, then immediately repeat it with a slightly different inflection. Finally I realized that he didn't like his first try and redid the line, but whoever was in charge of editing forgot to cut it out!<br /><br />I highly recommend this set to anyone who likes audio books. You get word-for-word Doyle, which the BBC productions don't give, while getting a highly skilled performer entertaining you.
B0025KVLTW|4.0|One thing I noticed about the Beatles re-issues was the unevenness associated which each song. Some songs blow me away and others are simply good. Don't get me wrong, each song sounds vastly improved. The White album is incredible, I'm shocked no remixing was done. However, Magical upon first listen was very disappointing. I mean over 22 years of waiting and this is the best they can do? I realize now since they handled each album differently all they wanted to do with this is clean it up a bit and make it sound clearer which it does. I just felt they could have beefed up this recording a bit. I feel like it has no balls. It's still better but for a 22 year wait they could have done more.
B001GCUO1Q|2.0|Thank god I am well again after watching Origins. I almost thought I had a lobotomy. Origins has no plot, subpar special effects and numerous gaping holes due to comic book characters having several thousand different story lines and experiences. Fights, fights and more fights are what we get here along with the usual \\"oh, so that's how Wolvie knows Blob\\" scenes. Gambit is here just because he's Gambit and fans have been screaming for him since the first X-Men film. Otherwise, he serves no necessary function. And the script is terrible, typical summer shlock, but what do you expect from comic book writers? If you really need to kill some time between jobs, pop this joint in and smoke it, but don't expect a memorable high.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|I've waited to review this because I had a copy of the 2006 American version, so at first this didn't blow me away. However, it really is done really well. It is slightly more cleaned up then the 2006 American version.
0385504225|4.0|This book was faced pace and a great read- just like Dan Brown's other  four books.  I would say however, that it was not my favorite of his books.  If you are expecting it to be as good as \\"The Da Vince Code\\" or \\"Angels and Demons\\" -it won't be.<br /><br />[...]
B0025KVLU6|5.0|Whoever said there isn't a dramatic difference is just old or not listening correctly. While I agree that some of the other albums there isn't a dramatic difference, this one there is. My friend and I were blown away after listening to certain tracks like Blackbird. My friend is a Bob Dylan fanatic, so for him to be blown away also was impressive. It's not the volume either, its just much better.

B002GZQYMK|4.0|This album is great stuff, but only if you don't pay attention to the lyrics. Some of them are pedantic and others are downright silly. A lot of praise has been lavished on the 3 part symphony, but honestly the first 4 tracks of the album are my personal favorite.<br /><br />I came into this CD after having been enamored of their previous two efforts. This album in some ways advances the musical ambitions of the band, but in many ways it is derivative of other bands. The first time I heard United States of Eurasia (which is seriously overplayed on domestic radio, according to some friends) there is a moment where one would swear you were listening to a new Queen track.<br /><br />Overall I enjoy this album, but in the long run I probably will not end up listening to it quite as much as I listened to their previous two.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|My girlfriend and I watched this one evening and had a blast laughing.  The changes in the original ABBA songs worked well, and the upbeat attitude was refreshing.  Yes, Brosnan needed an SOS with the singing, and Streep's scene singing The Winner Takes it All was overexposed and flat.  The supporting cast more than made up for those shortcomings and other songs were wonderfully uplifting.  We found ourselves humming the tunes over and over.  If you liked ABBA and disco but don't want to admit it, watch this movie.
0385504225|4.0|I enjoyed this book for the most part, but there were actions throughout this book that made me stop and think, couldn't this have been written a BIT more credible? Here Im not even addressing the mysticism or symbolic reference, I'm addressing the basic plot.      Overall, I enjoyed this book, the pace was fast and the story line interesting. However, that said, I felt frustrated by several situations where the feasibility of what the Author wanted me to buy into. From the begining I questioned Brown, allowing our \\"brilliant professor Langdon\\" to be so gullible in the first place and this seemed to a common thread throughout the storyline.     Protecting our \\"National Security\\" with a staff conisisted of what, a handfull of CIA operatives? Buzzing to and fro to cover all the bases throughout the plot? I know there have been federal cutbacks, but not very realistic. Come on.     And Ms. Solomons labratory being \\"in the dark\\" so to speak? Here again, I believe the author should have been more \\"illuminated\\" in the difference between feasibility and creative license.     In spite of all the symbolic elements common throughout Brown's book, I really felt \\"dumned down\\" by the author. That said, it was entertaining overall, although as others stated the ending left me unsatiated after such a gruelling quest.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|Special thanks to Sylvia Rhone, Ray Still & the rest of the staff at Universal for once again etching more meaning to the already crystallized legend of Stevie Wonder with the release of \\"Live At Last: A Wonder Summer's Night.\\" Recorded at the illustrious O2 arena in London, the clarity of this sensational live presentation penetrates and permeates throughout the entire DVD with enhanced Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and remarkable screen quality. Taking us on this exclusive 50-year musical journey, the genius of Stevie Wonder, with the strength of his band directed by bassist Nate Watts mellifluously leads the viewers on a series of highs! There are no low points on this album at all. Every song is the life of the party from beginning to the absolute end. The band and vocalists are phenomenal!! Keith John, Aisha Morris (Stevie's daughter), Dejah Gomez & Kimberly Brewer are having a wonderful time on the stage alongside the incredibly oozing guitar licks of Errol Cooney and Kyle Bolden, who meshed perfectly together on the Unity Melody of the song \\"Visions\\"!! Vocally, Stevie is STILL the quintessential vocalist of our generation as well as the epitome of what timeless and tenacious musical craft is all about. I loved everything, including the cover of Miles Davis' \\"All Blues\\", the UK Medley where Stevie and his guitarists sing using talk boxes. They masterfully flow right into Thom Bell & Linda Creed's \\"People Make The World Go 'Round.\\" Stanley Randolph & Fausto Cuevas put it down on drums and percussions! Fabulous! Overall, \\"Wonder Summer's Night\\" is so versatile and well-rounded. The quality is remarkable. The concept is refreshing and the album itself immortalizes and secures Stevie's place as a mastermind of epic popular music. GO GET THIS DVD!! You will not be disappointed!
B0025KVLUQ|3.0|Well...This is a comment on the sound of the remastering. Steve writes very well...but do we really need another opinion of how \\"good\\" this album is? Onto the sound: I was disappointed that these were not remixed. In an interview in the last Stereophile Magazine, the guys who remastered these disks say they equalized them \\"up\\" to sound louder. So the impact is more immediate. Also, when you read the article, it is clear that they took a hands off approach to anything beyond taking what they say are great sounding master tapes, and equalizing their sound. The stereo-only Abbey Road has a few things going for it: 1) Paul's bass is finally put where it belongs, as the lead bass it always was. The bottom end on a good stereo is very impressive. However, if you listen on computer only, I would not bother. This, I think, is a remastering for a full range system. 2) There is a bit more air behind the vocals...interesting and more emotionally involving. But I am so invested and involved with this record already...oh well. Pool your money with your buddies and share the cost. And don't forget the Stones...the remaster of Exile On Main Street and Beggars Banquet are extraordinary. That all this great music exists at all is a wonder. Gerard
0739321005|5.0|It is not well known (but it is becoming moreso) that the AudioBook version of Barack Obama's \\"Dreams From My Father\\", in which the author, himself narrates and speaks the parts of all the characters within, is a stunning experience. As well-written as the book is, and there are ample reviews here and elsewhere to attest to this fact, it is quite another thing to hear that sonorous voice actually telling you his/this very American story. Anyone who has ever been captivated by the man's speeches will say to themselves, \\"But of course!\\"

0385504225|2.0|\\"That Dan Brown,\\" I thought to myself several times as I read this book. \\"What an imagination.\\"    Credit where it is due. Dan Brown has a singular ability to take a great many likely very unrelated things and use them to authoritatively build a construct where none should exist. He managed to create a cute little Path of Illumination in \\"Angels and Demons\\" and a Grail conspiracy in \\"The da Vinci Code\\" (where he somehow never got around to mentioning that Grail stories don't appear until the 12th century).    Now in his latest book, he creates a bizarre Masonic conspiracy that involves a McGuffin so great it could Change The Whole World. The CIA is also involved, for some reason. Also, a man gets his hand cut off, and Robert Langdon runs around staring, at various times, in wonder, in awe, in stunned silence and bewilderment.    The book carries Langdon on a chase around Washington, DC, on one rather memorable Sunday night during the football playoffs. A mysterious call, apparently on behalf of a friend of his, sends him on his mission to apparently uncover some great Masonic secret or, depending on what's happening at any given moment in the story, not uncover some great Masonic secret.    This book was pretty insufferable, really. I rather liked \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The da Vinci Code\\" had it's moments, but this book didn't really. From the moment the concept of \\"noetic sciences\\" was introduced (you ever hear of \\"The Secret\\"? It's that), my eyes began rolling and didn't stop until the end, and then that was only because I think whatever muscle controls the rolling had gotten tired.    There's so much of this book that just doesn't make sense. Take the involvement of the CIA. What appears to be their internal affairs office spends much time running around DC, sending black ops people to do things and generally pushing around folks from other departments (hilariously the director of this office tells someone else, employed by an entirely different branch of the government, that she outranks him.  This is like the Chicago PD's internal affairs department saying they outrank an NYC police officer). Of course the CIA isn't allowed to operate on American soil, but since we all \\"know\\" they do anyhow, Brown has them do so in this book. There's no real reason for them to. He could've had it be the FBI, and that would've made a lot more sense and not strained credibility, but whatever.    And then there's the noetic sciences nonsense. Did you know thoughts have mass? I didn't, and I'm willing to bet this is news to most physicists, too. Brown likes to spout off a bunch of \\"scientific\\" theories in the book as though they are fact, which gets really irritating after a bit.    Also laughable is someone sustaining a very, very serious injury for which they have had no medical treatment, as well as dealing with the after affects of torture, and a serious psychological jolt... and a couple hours later this same person is traipsing about Washington without a care in the world or any real medical attention. Right.    There's one line towards the very end of the book where someone says, \\"I have witnessed human minds affecting the physical world in myriad ways.\\" You know what? I have, too. Those minds power hands, for example. I suggest you use your hands to not pick up this book...    ... ok, that's a little strained, but you get the idea. :)    The book gets two stars because it held my attention (when my eyes weren't a spinnin'), but it gets one star for everything else. Not worth buying.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|It's easy for me to give this one star after owning the Shark Euro Pro Sweeper for years.  They simply do not compare, except perhaps that the Swivel Sweeper with its flimsy construction is a bit more lightweight.  First, I had to laugh at the reviewer who suggested the Swivel Sweeper should be targeted to bald consumers!  That is so true. I have a lot of hair and I have to clean the swivel sweeper's inside out (think, dusty, dirty) each and every time I want to use it, because my hair is twisted around each rotating element, approximately 8 rotators I have to use a box knife to cut and pull on.  This has virtually eliminated any convenience of the product.  When it does get going it does an Okay job of picking up cat litter, etc, but tends to spit out other things, especially when its tiny collection box becomes on the full side.  I am going to try to return this, but suspect I am out the $.  I would say to anyone considering this to think again and buy the Shark.  My Mom owns the newer Shark sweeper and it has a convenient emptying reservoir that you don't have to touch to empty.  I like my old Euro Pro and have used it for years on the inside and outside of my house. None of these sweepers are really meant for carpeting, but if you have a lot of hardwood/ceramic floors, the Shark is for you.<br /><br />And as for the one star, I have owned my Swivel Sweeper for 3 weeks not and it is broken, makes a horrible sounds and will not rotate even though I have faithfully cleaned out any hair/string that may be clogging it. I suspect it is something in the motor compartment.
0385504225|2.0|The Masons are a spent force.  I just couldn't get excited over a group that was prominent 100 years ago and is in steady DECLINE.  There must be some powerful organisation that is benevolent but maybe not.  How about, World Vision, the UN, the World Bank, big oil, big tobacco, the green movement.  How about political correctness and Islam?  It's like some joker tried to write a thriller about the rise of communism!<br /><br />The Noetics do not need any free publicity.  The popularity of The Secret and The Alchemist show that there is an infinite supply of people happy to believe in lightweight nonsense.  Dan, you were supposed to be about paranoia and fear and you just went around giving some randoms more credibility than they deserve.<br /><br />What's more, I couldn't give a flying flee in a rolling down and out what happened to any of the characters.  Kill them all off for all I care.  I want my $25 back.

This is perfect for anyone that just doesn't have time to get a good hour-long workout in everyday.
0385504225|2.0|While the book does have a few good moments, and one surprising plot twist, overall it went nowhere.  Reading it I kept getting the feeling that it had no ending.  I'm not sure Dan Brown even knew were he was going with his \\"ancient mysteries\\", which seamed to change from one thing to another through the book as the characters kept changing their minds about what they were going to uncover.  The book seemed to drone on, it was difficult to finish, and the end was very disappointing.  The Lost Symbol uses the same formula of A&D's and The DaVinci Code, and does manage to recreate some of the suspense of Langdon's previous adventures.  However, this time around the \\"codes\\" were less believable, and it all just seemed like a waste of time. It just didn't live up to all the hype.
B002K8BLSA|5.0|Paddy's comeback has been unbelievably good. 12 wonderful songs, mixture of Andromeda Heights and Jordan, the comeback. He keeps being one the most intelligent and sensitive music writers of all times. The twelve songs are magic and lyric. I miss Wendy in the background chorus but it is just a question of nostalgy.     Only one slightly negative point, the recording. It is not bad in general but, I cannot understand why most recordings nowadays are registered so loud. It's not necessary doing so and Paddy, who was very comitted in his recordings quality, have missed this in \\"Let's change the world with music\\".    Whatever it is, the important thing is the music into the record. This is beautiful, moving and of course A MUST HAVE if you like Prefab Sprout. The return has been a surprise for me and now I am delighted.    Thanks Paddy and keep up the good work (included recording quality). Your records deserve reference recording techniques.

055380684X|5.0|As a pole vault coach and strength and conditioning specialist, I found this book to be very insightful. Daniel Coyle brings clarity to the process of technical mastery through science and research, all the while taking the reader on an adventure around the globe to \\"talent hotbeds\\" giving a firsthand look as to why particular groups are excelling in their craft, even despite sub optimal conditions.<br /><br />Prior to reading The Talent Code, I knew as a coach \\"for the most part\\" what things worked and what did not, but there was always a tendency for experimentation just to see if this or that could be even more effective. This search to discover more effective coaching techniques had the best of intentions but was essentially a form of guesswork. After reading the book, I realize how this could not only be ineffective but possibly disruptive to the learning process. On the other hand, the book validated particular coaching techniques I use that are effective and have worked for me in the past, but now I have a greater understanding as to why, so naturally I will continue to put more emphasis on these techniques in the future.<br /><br />After reading The Talent Code I am now moving forward with a stronger sense of certainty as to what is necessary for achieving technical mastery. I highly recommend this book to any coach, athlete, or artist looking to better themselves through a deeper understanding of how we go about learning and the process of skill acquisition.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I originally posted here and gave this book 2 stars but the more I think about it the more I realize how awful this book was. I said that I hated to give this author 2 stars, but I'm really giving the BOOK 1 star. This was boring and just an awful chore to get through and I feel that it is dishonest to give 2 stars when I think 1 is correct. There are over 300 reviews here (so far), so I don't need to repeat everything that was said, but besides having to endure countless pages of scientific and philosophical nonsense, you end up with a truly ridiculous \\"lost symbol.\\" I kept reading because I was sure that at least the ending would be good, but \\"yawn,\\" it wasn't. I can't recommend this and will not purchase another Dan Brown book until I've read the reviews.
B002K0WBYG|5.0|I won't wast space with a long review giving away the plot, but as a movie buff I have to write something about this film. Reynolds and Bullock smolder on the screen, and this chemistry creates some genuinely amusing and memorable moments. Betty White also steals many a scene with some great one-liners. If you are looking for a comedy that isn't all fart and sex jokes this film is for you. Women and men alike can enjoy the on-screen hi jinks and did i mention that Ryan Reynolds is HOT :P Definitely worth a purchase.
B002NHBNWW|2.0|I was not impressed with the pilot and probably will not watch again.  It just wasn't entertaining as True Blood or Twilight.  I think maybe we have enough different vampire shows to keep us entertained that we do not need another.

0316044938|5.0|I read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" when it first came out and heard a wonderful interview with Alice Siebold on the radio.  In the interview she said that the first chapters \\"just came to her.\\"  She made me believe that she was literally just channeling the young girl who has been murdered and wants her killer found.  In the years since, I've read many books that explain the \\"in Between\\" and communication -- documented communication -- from the In Between, and it's all changed my perspective and added to my enjoyment of this life.  If you, too are interested, the newest book I read is a dialog between a newly dead husband (with a wicked sense of humor) and his extremely stressed widow.  It's raw, funny and filled with sex.  Check it out!  It's amazing! [[ASIN:1844091392 Love from Both Sides: A True Story of Soul Survival and Sacred Sexuality]]
0937381888|5.0|Whether you have never brewed before, or you are a seasoned veteran - this book is a must have. For the beginner - this book contains not only the 'Hows', but also the \\"Why's\\" and the \\"What the heck happened's\\".  For the experienced, it has the little details you may have missed, along with a massive heaping of helpful tips. Understand - even the instructions you get from the local home brewing store (or some of the home brew supply shops on the Internet) can be flawed. I highly recommend this book - not so you can simply brew beer, but so that you can brew beer you can be proud of. You do not need a degree (high school or otherwise) in chemestry to understand this book. If you buy only one book on home brewing - this is your book.
1584282584|5.0|This book is a great book for flash photography. Not only for wedding but for general and people photography (not for macro though). This book explain the techniques very well with good examples. I find it especially useful for on-camera flash. One of my favorites photography book. Highly recommended.
B001QWBM62|2.0|I purchased the H4n after being unhappy with the H2's performance most significant where I couldn't record a good sounding signal that wasn't distorted with the Line In jack.  Only to find that the H4n has the same problem but not as bad.  If I try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the H4n's 1/4 inch jacks, it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal.  It appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp, adjusting the gain doesn't correct it.  I contacted Zoom's tech support about the H2 and was told that I likely had a defective unit.  I returned the H2 and decided to give Zoom another chance and try the H4n after seeing many positive reviews.<br />I really like the H4n's design, the menus and controls are nicely organized.  It feels more sturdy than the H2.  The recording quality using the built in mics is excellent.  Most other recorders in this price range don't have XLR inputs.  Since I plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board, if the line in jacks don't work properly and can't accept a normal line level signal without clipping, I can't use this for what I bought it for.  I have used my Sony minidisc recorder for the same type of application for the past 8 years and have never had any problems.  I've worked with pro sound equipment for over 25 years and have used many types of recorders and so far the Zoom products are the only ones where I have encountered this problem.  If you are using this to record with mics, it works great, but if you need to record from line level sources, the Zoom recorders may not be a good choice.  I exchanged this for the Tascam DR-07 and while the Tascam doesn't have as many bells and whistles, It is a nice recorder and I'm very happy with it.
B00005NTN5|5.0|This is one of the very few movies that I've watched more than once.  Superb acting combined with a terrific storyline... hard to beat.  One of those thrillers that kept me on the edge of my seat.  Bravo!
0385504225|1.0|Now, if you've read any of Dan Brown's prior works (such as \\"Angels and Demons\\", or his better known \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"), you know that you're not exactly expecting a masterpiece. Like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is a heavily plot-driven page-turner chock-full of whatever Mysterious Secretive Thing Dan Brown happened to be fascinated by when he was writing his novel (in this case Freemasonry). It centers around Robert Langdon, the protagonist from the prior two novels (who by now should be rather wary of mysterious invitations), who, with the Standard Pretty Female Sidekick (another \\"scientist\\", if you can call Noetic pseudoscience a \\"science\\"), explores a mystery in Washington D.C. while being pursued by the authorities and dealing with your friendly Large Fanatic Character (like Silas from \\"The Da Vinci Code\\").     The problem is that this book, unlike the \\"Da Vinci Code\\", is just not particularly fun to read. The Brown Formula for Chapter Writing is omnipresent (basically, have Langdon talk about something, have a realization, and end with a \\"what the . . .\\" chapter cliff-hanger), and the book is too long - by the time it finally reaches the conclusion, your reaction isn't \\"Well, that's interesting\\"; it's \\"finally! Is it over?\\".     It doesn't help that Brown goes over-board on exposition on Freemasonry and Noetic Science (or rather, his beliefs about both- Brown's \\"facts\\" usually don't correspond to reality) even by his standards, and adds a healthy dose of pseudoscience (which is actually new for him - \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" were both physically possible, even if you thought the plots were improbable).     I strongly, strongly suggest you avoid buying this book, or reading it. But if you can't resist, do yourself a favor and wait till you can get it in the library.
0307474275|5.0|The Da Vinci Code was a great book. It kept me interested the whole time. I had to keep myself from reading it all in one night. I saw the movie and it was pretty good, but the book is so much better. It is definately one of my favotites. If you like this book, then you'll love Angels and Demons, also by Dan Brown. Another great book. Now I can't wait for The Lost Symbol. What will he think of next?

B00127RAJY|5.0|As a busy mom, it's sometimes hard to find the time to workout.  I either walk or jog daily with my kids, but needed something to tone - I found it here!  I have been doing the DVD for a couple months now - 3 times a week, varying the workouts (level 1-3) so my body doesn't get used to any of them.  I really notice a difference in my muscle tone, especially in my arms!  It's only 25 minutes and I can do it easily while my daughter is in preschool and my toddler is napping!  She is tough, but I didn't want someone to hold my hand and coddle me through the entire workout!
0385504225|4.0|OK OK OK,  I don't understand some of the reviews.  I did see some of the plot twists coming but not most of them.  I enjoyed it, the book kept me engaged and I will recommend it.  It is better than Angels and Demons, not quite as good as DV Code but then how could it have been.  Good Job
0307455874|5.0|Though I thought I might not enjoy this book it was enlightening in ways I didn't think of.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I have to agree with a lot of the other posts about the book being predictable and seems like a recycling of characters from the two previous books.  I won't go into detail as the other posts as they have pretty much covered most items I happened to note.  The book is \\"okay\\" but wasn't worth the hype and \\"pre-order\\" mania that preceded it.  DB needs to develop a different storyline since this one was pretty predictable.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|Updated 10/16    Form and Fit  The good... The X41's are quite a bit lighter than competitive offerings like the AX360. The fabric wrapped foam is very comfortable and doesn't stick to your skin or make you sweat. You can wear the headset for a long time without any discomfort. The headset is also runs very cool. One complaint I've had with competitive sets is that they get very hot to wear. I'm not sure if they're generating heat internally or not venting the heat from my head, but after awhile they get uncomfortable. After 2 hours of gaming with the X41's on I practically forget I'm wearing them. Overall the ergonomics of this headset are top-notch. The bad... The volume adjust wheel is very small. A wider wheel in a larger diameter would make it easier to adjust volume on the fly. The microphone alignment is also a minor frustration. The microphone has a small arrow to indicate the proper plug alignment, but the flexible microphone arm allows it to be spun around. It's also worth noting that the headset uses two AAA batteries. Good for replacing, sort of annoying that in a $200 set you're not getting a built-in or removable rechargeable battery. Overall they're very minor complaints, and nothing that would stop me from buying the X41's.    Sound Quality   The good... The sound from these headphones rivals that of any similarly priced set of wireless Dolby 5 or 7 channel headphones. The X41's produce incredible detail and depth of sound. When playing shooting games you can differentiate if noises are behind you and to which side, very useful when trying to figure out where shots are coming from and which way to turn or run. The bass is very strong, and can actually be too much with the bass boost on. The bad... I can't say honestly if there's a noticeable difference between the 5 channel Dolby X4's or the 7 channel X41's. I have a friend with X4's and the sound quality is on par with his set. When I purchased my X41's they were $50 more than the X4's, and I don'thonestly think there's enough sound difference to justify the difference in price. Maybe very picky audiophiles can tell the difference, but I'm not sure an average joe can detect the difference between 5 and 7 channel sound in a headset. It's also worth noting that there's a quiet hiss or static noise at times. It's very slight, and never noticeable when you're playing any sort of action game, but it's there during times when there's no sound. I've been playing Batman Arkham Asylum recently, and during quiet times if I pay attention to just the sound, the hiss or buzz is there.     RF Performance  The good... 2.4GHz RF was one of the big selling points for me on the X41's rather than infrared. Being able to tuck the sending unit away in the entertainment center or behind the TV and not maintain line of sight. You can get up with the headset on and get at least 20 feet away from the sending unit before it starts to crackle, pop, and cut out. More than enough to get up and go into the kitchen for a snack. There's also no delay in the sound, a concern with some other models of wireless headsets. The bad... It's not advisable to try to test the range of the headset. The crackles and pops as your reach the edge of the RF range are way louder than the volume you may have had the headset volume at. To the point it hurts your ears.    Chat / Microphone  The good... I've used other Turtle Beach headsets and like the implementation of a separate volume control for the chat even though the sound is coming in over the same headset. The bad... My big disappointment right now has been with the microphone. In a word, it sucks. You buy a headset like this so you can play games without cranking the surround sound. Personally, it's so I can game after my kids are in bed. Yet the sensitivity on the microphone is horrible. I expect a headset like this to pick up normal conversational talk with no difficulty and high quality sound. I have to almost yell to get the mic to pick up what I'm saying. It's way less sensitive than the cheap headsets that come with your Xbox. I've also had complaints from people I'm playing with that I'm sending a stream of constant static and noise with the mic on. I tried Turtle Beach's online trouble shooting guides with no results. Tech support from Turtle Beach recommended many things, all simple stuff like replacing my batteries (already tried that), reversing the direction of the mic cord (tried that with no results), and removing the foam to make sure the mic receiver was facing the right direction (I'd already done that as their FAQ suggests that). Finally they sent me an RMA number and I returned my headset. I'm waiting for the fixed or replacement unit.    The Bottom Line  Based on my experience and the reviews of others here, there are obviously problems with the microphone and chat features on the X41. I purchased these just a couple weeks after the model was launched. I should have known better than to buy a new model. Turtle Beach probably pushed these into production too early without all the technical or manufacturing issues resolved. It's possible I just got a bad unit, but in reading other reviews there are several complaints of popping, cracking, and sound quality issues with the microphone and chat features. I'm really hoping it wasn't a mistake to send these back to Turtle Beach when I still had the option to just get my money back from Amazon. Overall I'm unsatisfied at this point, but I left my review at three stars rather than one star because tech support has been willing to help and I've had good luck with other Turtle Beach products. I'll update again when I get my replacement headset.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|This book gets 2 stars instead of just 1 because it did keep me entertained for the first half.  However, about 70% of the way through the book, it began to all fall apart.  Seriously, weighing the soul?  That has been attempted many times.  Since when does one patient having decrease in weight at death = weighing the soul.  Ick!  That is just the tip of the iceberg.  The ending seemed like he had gotten bored with his story line, or perhaps his deadline was coming due, and he rushed it as quickly as possible.  I only finished the book because I hoped he would redeem himself at the end.  He didn't.  Sometimes, it's best to stop when you're hot.  This is an instance of not stopping when you should.

0385504225|5.0|It was good fun. An emotional ride thats twist and turns through D.C. It's not \\"War and Peace\\" and won't win a Pulitzer, but hey, I just liked the fact that it was interesting, exciting, fast paced, and very entertaining. Robert Langdon's character lives on here to help the author fight the forces of darkness. Was I expecting a major revelation from God?  --No, just an escape from all the crap on TV.  Buy the book, or better yet, borrow it from someone who wrote a one or two star review because they won't care if you return it. I am keeping my copy thank you.
0470449748|5.0|The best approach for using the GMAT Official Guide:     The GMAT OG is a \\"must have\\" for everyone who intend to take the GMAT, but only if you use it the right way.     -First:   --Go through this book at the very beginning when you first start preparing for the GMAT.   --This will give you a good understanding of what you should expect to see when you take the actual test.     -Next:   --If you feel you are 100% comfortable with all the concepts involved - go ahead and crack every question in this book and you'll be good to go.   --If you feel you lack some if not all of the concepts involved - keep this book aside, go through some of the other study guides, and then at the end come back to this book and answer every question.     -Next:   --Buy the recommended books listed below.   --Take the official practice GMAT.     -Finally:   --If you feel, you still need more practice, consider browsing the internet to find any free questions you can lay your hands on.   --Once again take the free official practice test before your real test.     Positives:   -Indisputably, one of the best GMAT books - if you want to know what types of questions can potentially pop up on the GMAT.   -Excellent source for practicing real test questions for all difficulty levels.     Negatives:   -No conceptual knowledge of any concept whatsoever.   -Answer explanations are fine, but not that methodical.     GMAT Books: If you are serious about getting a high score, I'd recommend doing the following:   -Buy the latest edition of OG.   -Buy Barron's book as this is one of the best all-in-one review book (except the CD).   -For Verbal Practice - consider Kaplan/PR Workbooks, and Dummies book.  -For Verbal Review - consider Kaplan/Arco, and Manhattan for SC.  -For Math Practice - consider Kaplan/PR Workbooks, or EZ GMAT Basic WB for medium-difficulty problems and Advanced WB for most-difficult problems.   -For Math Review - consider Kaplan/Nova if you need a basic refresher, or EZ GMAT Review Books if you want a more in-depth coverage of each and every math concept.   Of course, amazon is a great place to get all these books at one place and at the best price.     I am certain that if you follow the above steps, you'll be well prepared for the GMAT without the need to take any expensive prep course or private tutoring. I did a lot of struggle preparing for the GMAT and that's why I know how painful it can be if one doesn't have the right guidance.     I really hope that I was able to help at least some of you who are still trying to figure out the best approach to prepare for the GMAT.     Thanks for reading and good luck with your exam.
0385504225|2.0|With a long six year anticipation after Da Vinci Code, I was excited to receive this book on release date.    However, the more I read, I couldn't erase my feeling that this book will be the worst Dan Brown book I've read.    Now that I have finished the book, I can say with certainty that this book is indeed the worst one from Dan Brown.    Here are few reasons why I think it's worst:    1. Similar story line as Angels & Demons / The Da Vinci Code  A story of lunatic who wants to reveal old, ancient and mystic secret.  AGAIN. Seriously?    2. Usage of unrealistic high-tech stuff  Come on. 'Breathable water'  Somebody drowned. Turns out he didnt because he was still breathing due to 'oxygenated liquid.'    ARE YOU KIDDING ME?      3. Story line being too obvious  I knew the story line will end at the place it ends before Langdon and his crew went there. The description was too obvious but Langdon took forever on chit chatting.    A tall stone in Washington DC. Doesn't that ring a bell already?  I've never been to DC and still I figured out the place where the book ends.          How can you mess up so bad, Dan Brown?      P.S: Did all that iPhone, Wikipedia, Twitter, etc talking necessary?
0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown needs to try something new. The other two Robert Langdon books follow the same formula, and I felt a little cheated at the end of \\"Symbol.\\" I figured out the big plot twist almost as soon as I met the villain, though at least Brown doesn't cheat in that regard. Overall, I had a hard time putting the book down, though I hope Brown's next book is a little less familiar. I'm tired of reading the same book over and over.
0385504225|1.0|This book is a badly cloned version of his two previous books, it is 200 pages too long, the plot and twists are obvious. Most of the characters in the book are disconnected and none are really likable that the reader can hang on to.     Even Robert Langdon himself, he could have shut up half of the book to make the story more readable, but instead he went on with the constant rambling of \\"facts\\" that gets extremely tedious to read at times on top of too many \\"now I get it, now I don't\\" moments. I won't comment on the bad writing, you obviously don't read a Dan Brown book for his prose.    I've never written a review before until this book compelled me to. I can't believe I waited 7 years for this crap. Save your money for something else.
0385504225|5.0|I just finished reading this latest offering from Dan Brown and it made me smile. I was somewhat surprised to see the number of negative reviews but after reading a number of them, the reasons are obvious. I think a number of readers just wanted an entertaining read without any thought provocation. In that regard, The Lost Symobol may have fallen a little short. On the other hand. the narrow minded Christian fundamentalists had their beliefs challenged and reacted negatively, as is to be expected.     Da Vinci Code was more blatantly and obviously more controversial because of the subject matter. I am sure that is why it is currently the best selling novel of all time. However, The Lost Symbol is equally controversial, if the reader actually takes the time to think about the message of this book.     Dan Brown's attention to detail and his ability to weave a number of disparate and seemingly unrelated and insignificant symbols into a thought provoking story line, never ceases to amaze me. As other reviewers have already commented, I too had to Google along, in order to get a better understanding of the subject material. I have no problem with that, and found it to be a very enlightening experience. Is the Lost Symbol formulaic? Yes Does it detract from the message?  Not at all !    It seems that we live in a time where readers and movie goers seem to just crave pure eye brow raising and adrenaline rushing entertainment, in order to escape from the trials and tribulations of their daily lives. They  have no desire to be left with anything to think about; that is just too much work. For those of you in that category, I would recommend a Marvel comic book.    I found The Lost Symbol an interesting read, and although I am not a religious person, I am tempted to read the Bible again, but from a totally different perspective.
0385504225|4.0|Fortunately for Mr. Smith when he went to Washington, he didn't have to endure the fear, suspense, and agony that Mr. Robert Langdon must. Speaking of movies, [[ASIN:B00005JN5E National Treasure (Widescreen Edition)]] enjoyed box office numbers in part because of Dan Brown's humongous hit of a novel, [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]]. But instead of mining clues from European symbols in architecture and secretive organizations, it focused on Washington D.C. and its Freemason founders. Now, Dan Brown ironically chooses the same location and the same Masonic brotherhood as the basis for his newest Robert Langdon thriller, [[ASIN:0385504225 The Lost Symbol]].<br /><br />NATIONAL TREASURE was considered by many to be perhaps a rung below THE DA VINCI CODE in terms of plot and general implementation of its idea. How then does THE LOST SYMBOL measure up to THE DA VINCI CODE? Well, this reviewer would say that lightning did not strike twice. This novel doesn't cohere as naturally as did THE DA VINCI CODE; at times THE LOST SYMBOL gives the impression of being a bowl into which interesting but not necessarily connected research was tossed together. Nevertheless, Brown's latest packs enough of his trademark suspense, chilling violence, and brainteasing puzzles for fans to snap it up and devour it as fast as possible.<br /><br />Here are a few specific examples of why THE LOST SYMBOL doesn't quite live up to its wildly best-selling predecessor: THE DA VINCI CODE revolved around a mystery that became very human (literally). THE LOST SYMBOL doesn't quite go the same distance; although there is undeniable human drama for Robert Langdon and his friends, Katherine and Peter Solomon, its core mystery (no spoiler here) remains more esoteric and more cerebral. This wouldn't necessarily be a demerit, but somehow Brown's eagerness to fashion a mystery around the Capitol's architecture and the supposed foundations of Masonic beliefs, together with rather vague inclusions of noetic studies, near death experiences, decreased puzzle-solving, and other \\"potpourri\\" of ingredients doesn't quite gel as successfully as his dazzling -- though not without much-bandied-about flaws -- fictional tale about searching for the Holy Grail. Possibly, \\"unmasking\\" Masonry can't push the same buttons as when turning Christianity on its head.<br /><br />Brown also errs in THE LOST SYMBOL by intimating the possible onset of a huge catastrophe if Langdon and others cannot stop the central villain. The build-up suggests something truly earthshaking, but the revelation of the actual consequences turns out to be anticlimactic.<br /><br />And, as usual, Brown infuses his fast-paced novel with some twists and turns, but most can be predicted by the reader in advance. Perhaps Brown intentionally structures his books thusly to make the readers feel smarter than hero Langdon. If so, this is a double-edged sword because readers can judge the plot too obvious and beset with some howling instances of foreshadowing.<br /><br />Interestingly, Langdon, in THE LOST SYMBOL, is often in the role of student rather than teacher. He does, assuredly, tap his vast knowledge of symbols at crucial times, but he, not being a Mason, more often than not, accedes to others with more intimate understanding. In short, he appears more diffident, more secondary, in this novel than in THE DA VINCI CODE.<br /><br />Allegedly, some folks believed that THE DA VINCI CODE was -- despite its claim to the contrary -- nonfiction. THE LOST SYMBOL clearly states  before the story opens on which basic facts Brown built to get this novel off the ground, but just as clearly the novel is just that, a novel. And due to its subject matter (Masonry,etc.), fewer people will probably, at any point, wonder whether this thriller actually does reveal real secrets than did when devouring the previous blockbuster.<br /><br />This novel will provide solid hours of signature Brown entertainment even if it doesn't cohere as naturally as did THE DA VINCI CODE. Just curiosity to find out what is happening to Robert Langdon now and how he might conquer his latest misadventure is reason enough to secure a copy of THE LOST SYMBOL and decide for yourself how much you like it. And when THE LOST SYMBOL is made into a movie, we can all compare it apples to apples to NATIONAL TREASURE as well. While we're at it, it wouldn't hurt to catch [[ASIN:B001GLX6UI Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]] again either. :)<br /><br />3.7 stars.o find out what is happening to Robert Langdon now and how he might conquer his latest misadventure is reason enough to secure a copy of THE LOST SYMBOL and decide for yourself how much you like it.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|For a major Beatles fan who innocently didn't mind the 1987 CD releases (who can forget the booklet for Sgt. Pepper?) having this really set me straight!!!  I'm loving this and to make it short and simple, in addition to the greatest music ever recorded, the mini-documentaries are an added bonus!!  I cannot wait for my Mono set to come in!!!  Thanks always to John (and Yoko), Paul, George (and Olivia) and Ringo!!!
B00005LK94|5.0|\\"Fly Away Home\\" was a movie that I had never watched until I saw it recently and thought it would be a great movie to share with my almost 5-year-old. It stars Anna Paquin [of \\"The Piano\\" and also the recent \\"True Blood\\"] as 13-year-old Amy, who has lost her mother in a car accident and finds herself being whisked off to rural Ontario, Canada by her estranged father Tom [Jeff Daniels]. Amy struggles with her grief whilst trying to adapt to her new living conditions, including a father she barely knows. When Amy discovers a clutch of orphaned goose eggs, she takes care of the eggs until they hatch, and insists on caring for them, despite the ominous presence of an animal control officer who wants to take possession of them<br /><br />The movie deals with myriad themes - grief, the bond between a young girl and the orphaned animals she loves, the pangs of adolescence, the bond between a father and child, and the simple, but true love of nature. Anna Paquin shines in the lead role, and reflects a maturity and determination uncommon in one so young. Her interactions with the geese come across as natural and credible, and are a delight to watch. I also loved watching how father and daughter eventually bond over the task of teaching the geese to migrate in the face of winter, using an ultralight!<br /><br />Truly a classic in family entertainment, and a movie that sets your spirits soaring!
1439102813|4.0|This is a great book!  Sure, lots of reviews start off that way.  They try to grab your attention by posting that, but that is not the case here.  While flawed in some aspects, this is STILL a great book (no pun intended).    For me, this was also a very personal novel.  I work at a bookstore and this was on our \\"What We Recommend\\" list, so I checked it out.  Around this time, my Papaw began showing signs of dementia.  He moved in with us as it got worse and worse.  He could barely remember what happened that morning, let alone what happened yesterday or the day before that.  It caught me off guard how accurate this novel is.    Character development is rather still.  While you see how they react with each other at the beginning, the development isn't as fullfilling as one would hope.  However, as you read and see it through Alice's eyes, you can decide if they aren't developing, or if they really are and she just can't tell.    Regardless, buy this book.  Without a doubt THE BEST novel on Alzheimer's ever written.
0385504225|3.0|Since the plot has been well-outlined by other reviewers, I'm just going to say what worked for me and what didn't. I enjoyed the Da Vinci Code and also Angels and Demons, but I did not think they were masterpieces, just entertaining thrillers. \\"The Lost Symbol\\" sticks to the formula that has made Dan Brown a household name. The protagonist, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon finds himself in Washington, D.C., desperately racing against time to save his mentor, Peter Solomon, who has been kidnapped. There is an antagonist in the form of the tattooed man, the mystically named Mal'akh. There is a potential love interest, and a new branch of science \\"Noetics\\".<br /><br />The action is well-paced, with a fair balance between action and dialogue, and it's easy reading, though at times I felt the writing could have done with better editing. In comparing \\"The Lost Symbol\\" with the DVC and A&D, I think it falls somewhere in between the two. Part of why the DVC elicited so much debate was because of its controversial religious theme that was seen as heretical by religious groups. In \\"The Lost Symbol\\", I did not find this great spark of controversy that is going to get people discussing this work as much as the DVC.<br /><br />The author's writing skills are pretty much the same as in his previous books, and I do not think there has been much maturing in this aspect (i.e. cardboard characters, tepid dialogue). Final verdict - a fast-paced read, with plenty of action and some food for thought. Fans of action and conspiracy thrillers will find this a good diversion, but I hardly think it's outstanding.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|bought it for 'given up' raw for lp. kinda liked the other tracks, no suprise, well crafted tunes.
B0025KVLSI|5.0|Well I bought all the remasters and put this one off getting till near to last. After reading the reviews ect I figured this would have been the least enjoyable of all. Boy was I wrong  matter of fact this one ranks near the top in my opinion of the Beatles catalog. I like it because it is a different style than the others and sounds refreshing to me. And really Mr Moonlight isn't all that bad either. I am pleased. 5 Stars
0385302320|5.0|This is the first time that I have purchased a hard cover book from Amazon.  The book looks like it was never read. The cover was perfect, and there were no mars on the book
0385504225|5.0|I find this to be one of the best Brown novels yet. I have all of his books and liked them all, but I have to say I have enjoyed this one more than the others, save maybe Angels & Demons. It was interesting to look up all the different things in the book and research the true story behind it while reading.
0385504225|3.0|I sincerely hope that The Lost Symbol is Dan Brown's last book using this formula.  After The DaVinci Code & Angels and Demons readers will find the story, pace, twists and overall plot very familiar.  Other than the physical setting, there's nothing new here.  Each page felt like I'd read it before because I essentially had in Brown's previous books.  Unfortunately I believe that Dan Brown's books have been getting weaker over time.  Having recently reread [[ASIN:B002M3SP32 Digital Fortress: A Thriller]] I enjoyed it significantly more than The Lost Symbol, despite its now dated technological references.      I'd wait to buy this until the million copies that sold the first day show up on Amazon for a couple of bucks each used.
0307454541|5.0|I picked this book thinking it had to do with Asian culture due to the name. (You can tell I didn;t pay much attention to the author!).  Turned out to be totally different but I really enjoyed it.  It took me about 70 pages to get into it and for the plot to start to reveal itself and then I was hooked.  The characters were interesting, the plot(s) were heart renching and it made me go out and buy the sequel right away.  Lizbeth Sanders is one of the most unique characters you will ever find.  You will grow to like her and even possible understand her.  This is not your 'typical' James Patterson or 'vanilla' author but if you take a chance on reading something a little different, I think you will enjoy this.............now if I can only finish the sequel soon I will be ready for the third book!
0385504225|1.0|A famous Princeton professor once received the following evaluation from a student whose father had clearly lectured him on the value of an Ivy education:  \\"the lectures were boring, but long.\\"<br /><br />My academic friends make fun of me for reading Dan Brown, but, you know, I enjoy a good conspiracy yarn.  And - although the stuff of Angels and Demons and The da Vinci Code is in my professional ballpark - I like seeing the material framed in a populist narrative, even if it's a bit abbreviated and gently twisted.<br /><br />News flash:  ironically - sadly? - my students are more receptive to Brown than to Elaine Pagels as an authority for the Mary v Peter shaping of Christianity, so there's actually a Dan Brown Bonus in the humanities classroom.<br /><br />But this is a boring book.<br /><br />Boring boring boring.  It has all of Brown's weaknesses and none of his strengths.  There are the flat characters, the unlikely plotting, the absurd chronology, but there's no zippy secret agenda compelling the reader's attention.  The didactic passages fall with a dull thud and the dialogue is gruesomely banal. Tattoo Man simply doesn't stack up against the Roman Church as a worthy opponent.  Washington DC is a poor third to Paris and Rome as a setting, nor does Brown offer us anything to up the stakes.  I liked Sato and wanted to like Katherine, but the whole Solomon thing was just too cheesy for (even) escape reading.<br /><br />The material on noetics is mildly interesting, but badly presented, and the Masonic stuff is sadly ho-hum.  Brown's strategies for down-loading info have not grown more graceful with time - nor, indeed, has his writing --  nor have his editors offered any amelioration.<br /><br />I anticipated it;  I ordered it;  I eagerly opened it.<br /><br />I have tossed it aside.  Save your money.<br /><br />For a book that heralds the apotheosis of the human intellect (well, of the male human intellect with a touch of Star Wars) this makes a decent paperweight.

0385474547|5.0|If you are someone who knows very little about African culture and would like to learn more, this book is for you.  I consider this a \\"light read\\".  It isn't an \\"easy read,\\" because of the African names and words that are in the story.  Keeping track of characters with similar names can slow the reader down at times.  However, the characters in this story come to life and are easy to sympathize with.  This story helps readers to understand some of the current day politics in parts of Africa.  It is a story of Africa from a perspective that is still considered fresh - a point of view from an African.<br /><br />I would argue that this story is really about \\"change\\" and a person's response or lack of response to change.  There are lessons for those who are considered the \\"graying workforce,\\" who are having to adapt to new ways of doing things on the job.  Achebe could easily be talking to Americans today who are struggling to adjust to proposed changes in our laws and policies at the local and federal levels.  The America of last year; and of ten years ago, is history and may be no more.  The message is clear...ready or not, here it comes.  Change.  Either prepare for change or get run over by it.

0743297334|5.0|Back-to-School book this year was Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\" Glorious. A totally different book than the one I read almost 45 yrs ago! Have I changed so? Or did Ernest re-edit given my experience? Having visited Pamplona, San Sebastian and Madrid, the Spanish \\"books\\" became more real and thereby more impressive. On first reading as a student, I was struck by the gore of the bullfight, now I see the majesty. There is such a strong parallel in the telling of the grace of the bullfight - the aficion - to \\"The Old Man and the Sea.\\" Before, I was so deflected by what I read as Hemingway's macho bias, that I failed to fully admire his spare but powerful style. I had failed to recognize the poignancy and disillusionment of his flamboyant characters. Reading \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" in the early 70's, perhaps, I was not prepared to accept disillusionment -- or wanted to hold it at bay. Now, I accept the cultural ennui as a reflection and not necessarily as a vortex. My favorite line comes from a supporting character, Michael, the alcoholic, penniless Scotsman. When asked how did he go bankrupt, he answers: \\"Two ways: gradually and then suddenly!\\"
0385504225|4.0|While I would admit that Dan Brown is not the most gifted author when it comes to his choice of words, I will definitely say that his stories are always interesting.  I was a big fan of the first two novels in the Langdon series, and I was not disappointed when I read this one.  It is a worthy successor to the first two.  I think that the strength in Brown's novels, whether \\"factual\\" or not, is that he offers good alternative, fun, \\"food for thought\\" versions of the stories that our society holds dear, while wrapping a good thriller around them.
B00004XPPK|5.0|This is film noir at it's best! Great cast. This film is mystifying and intriguing! Add this to your collection right now before it goes out of print.
0743497465|5.0|Excellent read ... kept my interest and intrigue.  Sometimes explainations of the technical and scientific data went over my head ... but not a detraction from the story in any way.  Played political games into story in a very realistic and dramatic way.
B002GY9F9K|2.0|I've read all the Harry Potter books and loved them. When I ended up watching the movies, I was surprised that they made them even better than the books, trimming parts in the book that were weak to make the story in the movies solid and enjoyable. Film adaptation of books need not be a bad thing!    When I heard Sam Raimi was working with Terry Goodkind on a Sword of Truth series, I has a nerd-gasm. I loved the Evil Dead movies, and most everything else by Sam (except Spider-Man 3, unfortunately). I had also read all of Terry's books and cherish them as one of my all-time favourite fantasy series.    What a disappointment! I never thought two of my favourite storyteller could create such a hashed series. The story was dumbed down for the most simple-minded viewer. I totally understand that when you're making an adaptation, many things need to be changed, but some of the most useful and interesting plot points and devices were dropped out of what seemed like laziness!    I can see some people liking this show, it is not too much for the simple minded to chew. But if you loved the books, there's a very good chance you will not like this show. As other people mentioned, watch some episodes on Hulu (if you live in the States) ot try to get a torrent of them, before you decide to purchase the show.
0061766089|4.0|Change by Design explores an approach to innovation that is accessible to all types of individuals (not just designers), can be integrated into different aspects of business and society, and will generate not only breakthrough ideas, but ideas that can be successfully executed and have an impact.<br /><br />There are two sections to the book, the first focusing on the expansion of design to include more people and roles in the organization and how the field of design itself has expanded from products to include services, experiences, and organizations.  The second part of the book looks at practical application of these ideas, and case studies.<br /><br />One of the fundamental concepts of the book is the foundation of design thinking, focusing on what Brown calls the \\"three overlapping criteria for successful ideas:\\" feasibility (what is functionally possible), viability (can it become part of a sustainable business model), and desirability (will people understand it and want it).<br /><br />These three criteria, coupled with the ideas of an iterative, overlapping process and early, fast, cheap prototyping makes the book worthwhile, especially when used in the non-product examples.<br /><br />Tim Brown is the CEO and President of IDEO, and as such, the book is full of examples and stories from his IDEO experience.  This is not a detriment, as long as the reader is aware that Change by Design is not a complete perspective of design theory, but the views based on the experience and success of an individual.
B000SEHG5U|2.0|One could be critical of Dawkins book because it is an unashamed polemic. But this would miss the point somewhat. As it would state the obvious.    What is less obvious is that it is simply poor research. If Dawkins was to undertake his science in the way he undertakes his \\"theological\\" research he would not have passed undergraduate. The book is simply littered with simplistic factual errors, errors of gross generalisation and errors of bias. One can forgive bias but not when it generates deliberate of misguided distortions. To give two example, Dawkins asserts that:  - Buddhism is not a religion but rather a lifestyle and therefore is not subject to his critique. This assertion would greatly surprise Buddhists. They may have a slightly different version of God (a non \\"theistic' version) but to say that they are not a religion is absurd  - the argument that as he aged Mohammed became less violent is not supported by the Koran which has its more virulent passages late in it. This of course is true but even the most naive scholar know the Koran is not organised chronologically but from shortest to longest chapter. It is incontrovertible that Mohammed's more compassionate view of the nature of God developed over life.

When I started, I read this cover to cover and LOVED the descriptions, the insight, the simplicity, and the information. Now as a seasoned home-brewer, this is now a spectactular reference book. As I discover NEW things to try (Flanders? -- Check! Lambic? -- there too!) I realize, truly, what a depth of knowledge is included in this tome. Honestly, besides the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, this is the book I have read more than any other -- if you are brewing, please please please start here. There are others that will get you making beer and/or wine that is too hoppy/simplistic respectively. Stand on the back of Giants instead, read this, experiment -- and make (wonderful!) mistakes, and you will not be dissapointed. If you want a simple recipe book, a \\"Color by number\\" brewing tome ...this is not your book as it has TOO much information to dig through for you.

0307387178|5.0|A very thought provoking book. The life of Chris McCandless is researched well by the author. It was thought out and well written. It is a book that has kept me thinking long after I finished reading it. Well worth reading.
0385504225|3.0|I'll make this quick as it seems most people have similar reviews. First, the story and theme was much too similar as the previous books. I couldn't help but wonder in the beginning chapters, if indeed the book plot's and ending would be similar. Unfortunately, I was right... Although the research was fascinating and kept me entertained, the book was just too alike the Da Vinci code. It killed most of the suspense and thrill. In fact, some parts where otherwise would be interesting became rather dull. The professor and a female companion running away from the police while in the midst of trying to solve a puzzle? Hmmm....    Is there going to be a big twist in the end like the others? Oh no...    Anyhoo, good/average book but nothing great...I would recommend going to Barnes and Noble on a Saturday/Sunday morning, order a nice cup of coffee and brownie and finish it right there.

I think the Games in this book are, in their own way, even more terrifying than in the first. The idea of the island, the players involved and the stakes do so much for the story that I'm sitting here covered in goosebumps.  To make matters even worse I know that I'll be blubbering like a baby on Tuesday because Suzanne Collins has a way of twisting a story so well that you can't help but get caught up in it.<br /><br />Fantastic middle book to a brilliant trilogy!

0307460444|2.0|I'm not a huge fan of Martha Stewart to begin with, but when my sister bought me this book I was so excited. The recipes looked fantastic, the color photos were awesome, and the decorating ideas were fun. So I decided to start with the most basic recipes, the buttermilk cupcakes with the dark chocolate frosting. I'm not a novice baker, and the instructions were simple and clear, so when the cupcakes turned out horribly I was really surprised. The buttermilk cupcake recipe was just \\"off\\" - the cupcakes were much too dense. The dark chocolate frosting was the real disappointment, though - it was so bitter and the consistency was far too thin. I used high-quality chocolate and cocoa, as well as high-quality butter, so it's not a case of using inferior ingredients and getting an inferior end result - this is a recipe flaw. I thickened the frosting a bit and was able to pipe it onto the cupcakes, but the finished product was just not what I was looking for. There are far better cupcake cookbooks and recipes out there. I'm giving this book 2 stars, however, because of the great decorating ideas and instructions included in the book. But if you're looking for stellar tasting cupcakes, I'd look elsewhere for recipes.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|I've avoided listening to the entire Death Magnetic album (as much as one could with Sirius XM playing just about the whole damn album every hour) for almost a year. The album was released on September 12th, so I figured I'd finally sit down with the album and give it a listen, straight through. I figured since the hoopla about a new Metallica studio release died down, I'd be able to give it a good listen. I borrowed the album from the local library, and proceeded to listen to it non-stop, start to finish. I even put it on my favorite stereo in the CD player to give it every single advantage I could afford the album. I wanted the musical package to speak for itself. The conversation was long, and wandered a great deal, but I gave the album as much a fair shake as I could.    The first album of Metallica I picked up was \\"And Justice for All\\", and it continues to be one of my benchmark albums for the band. Sure, \\"Master of Puppets\\" is a great album, but \\"Justice\\" is where I cut my teeth in the world of Metallica. So I'm not some \\"Cliff's death killed the band\\" fanatic. Cliff was long gone by the time I started liking Metallica.    \\"Death Magnetic\\" has that feel of a super-group album. It's the kind of album where a bunch of talented musicians get together, bring their pet ideas, and make an album. I've picked up some super-group albums that were absolutely phenomenal (Liquid Tension Experiment, Bozzio Levin Stevens, Attention Deficit) and some that were pretty mediocre. The reason I think some of these albums aren't in the phenomenal category is because the event was worth more to the musicians than the music itself. Sure, getting in the same room with your musical idols and peers is good, but what makes a great album is the music that goes on the album. If the music isn't good, the only people who will care are the artist completionists who just want the privilege of owning the album; they couldn't care less what's on it. The reason I think Death Magnetic is a supergroup album is because there's a bunch of jumbled together ideas on this album, and no clear direction of where to go with the songs. There's no coherent thought or direction or (god forbid) editing on the songs, so they just meander along, collecting riffs and choruses until someone screams \\"we're running out of tape\\" and the song abruptly stops. There were several instances where I found myself wishing the song would end, and about a minute or two later, the song just petered out with no explanation or reasoning. The whole album felt like a big incoherent mess.    Whomever was responsible for the final mix on this album needs to never work behind a mixing board ever again. This is the most compressed and unpleasant to listen to music I have ever heard. The louds are too loud, and crescendos turn into a completely muddy mess. I know its just rock `n roll, man, but seriously this album didn't need this mix to be overdriven like this. Turn it down, maaan.    I have a feeling Robert Trujillo brought in some of his background from Infectious Grooves into Metallica (that's not a bad thing at all). Ive enjoyed Robert's work with Infectious Grooves and Suicidal Tendencies, and I think Robert brings good things to the band. There were some points that reminded me of the funk-metal style that I love. Unfortunately, the rest of the band seems to think funk metal = Rage Against the Machine or Limp Bizkit because that influence was very strong on several songs. And again, once the band got into a groove, there was some little musical collapse that busted up the groove and turned it once again into a muddled mess.    \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" sucks. Period. I hate that song with a fiery passion.    \\"The Unforgiven III\\" is every single rock-n-roll cliché, done poorly, times three. The song starts with a piano riff that reminds me of Motley Crue's \\"Home Sweet Home\\", and devolves from there into a song that's three times longer than it needs to be. About the only thing it neededwas a 40 something with a Chinese dragon shirt yelling \\"Freebird\\" while his Zippo lighter illuminated the night.    \\"Suicide and Redemption\\" is the only instrumental on the album, and sounds like one of those Pro-Tool looped instrumentals on your garden-variety guitar-god album. (Think Steve Vai / Joe Satriani but not quite as flashy). I don't think Joe Satriani and Steve Vai have anything to worry about from this song.    What is with the song lengths on this album? I looked down at the CD player, thinking I was on track 7 or so, but was horrified that it was only on track 5. Only Tool and Dream Theater can get away with an 8 minute song, and there's a reason for it called \\"interestingness\\". Repeating the same verse / chorus / verse / chorus / verse / chorus / verse / chorus just doesn't cut it.    For all of the bad and mediocre songs on this album there's one absolutely stand-out song: \\"The Judas Kiss\\". Its an uncompromising odd-meter song, and was the only song that got me thinking \\"yeah, this is Metallica. This is thrash metal. This is GOOD\\". If this was the only song that Metallica recorded and released in the 20 year span between \\"And Justice for All\\", I think people would still be vehemently hailing the triumphant return of Metallica. This song would live comfortably at the end of \\"And Justice for All\\" right after \\"Dyer's Eve\\". Why couldn't there be at least three or more songs of this caliber on this album?    Overall, I'm not terribly thrilled with \\"Death Magnetic\\". Its tiring, boring, and doesn't (dare I say it?) rock at all. The songs have a certain paint-by-numbers feel to them that belies a lack of coherency and artistic vision. There's no excitement in this album, just a lot of repeated noise. All through the album I kept forcing myself not to fast-forward to the next song (including \\"The Day that Never Comes\\", which was quite a feat). I'm glad I borrowed this album, because I can safely say I wouldn't care to part with the cash to own it. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: there's ar more interesting albums to part me from my cash.
B00151G08Y|5.0|For the longest time, Pendulum was my favorite band.  Granite and other songs has a rock-like feel, while other songs were the Drum and Bass that made them famous.  This CD is a sort of departure for them, as they really make a move in the direction of the heavier more rock based music.  That said, it is very very good music that is here, but it isn't drum and bass, for the most part.    Should you get it?  Yes, you should.  If you like rock, and you like drum and bass this is a perfect blend which is very fun to just pump up.  If you want pure drum and bass though, there is still Noisia and Spor.  If you want something new, this is it.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|L.A. CONFIDENTIAL(1997)---Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, David Strathairn<br /><br />Based on the 3rd novel of James Ellroy's, \\"L.A. Quartet\\"(\\"The Black Dahlia\\"; \\"The Big Nowhere\\"; \\"L.A. Confidential\\"; and \\"White Jazz\\") this movie is---IMO---one of the two best \\"modern/color\\" noirs out there(the other being, of course, CHINATOWN). The plot has many tangents that, for once, are all neatly brought together by the film's end. The central plot involves the brutal murder of several people in an all-night diner. The film unfolds primarily through the attempts of 3 very different cops, with very different motives, to solve the case. Bud White(Russell Crowe) is an old-fashioned cop who is quite willing to not only \\"bend\\" a few rules, but to outright stomp on them in his pursuit of \\"justice\\". Ed Exley(Guy Pearce) is a by-the-book son of a legendary cop who was killed in the line of duty---Exley is driven by his need to live up to/exceed his old man's reputation. Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey) is a venal, celebrity-loving cop who is more concerned with his role as \\"technical adviser\\" for a \\"Dragnet\\" type TV show than with his duties as a police officer. Vincennes gradually begins to regret his behavior and gets involved in trying to solve the diner murders. These 3 cops are inexorably drawn together in their pursuit of a solution to the crime. Along the way, they must deal with the machinations of a corrupt Chief of Detectives(James Cromwell), a shadowy figure named Pierce Patchett(David Strathairn) who runs a stable of high-priced hookers cut to look like movie stars---Kim Basinger plays Patchett's, \\"Veronica Lake\\", with whom the Russell Crowe character is smitten---and is involved in other nefarious activities, and the sleazy publisher of a \\"Confidential\\" type \\"tell all\\" magazine(Danny DeVito). As noted, the plot takes more twists and turns than a sidewinder wriggling across the desert but, in the end, everything is all neatly tied up. This is just a terrific film---I've seen it several times and it never grows stale.d up. This is just a terrific film---I've seen it several times and it never grows stale.

B001GCUO16|3.0|1st off Hugh Jackman did a great job as wolverine as usual, and I like the new Sabertooth no offense to Tyler mane but this Sabertooth is more true to the comics Victor creed was also very smart and cunning not just a brute like in the 1st X-men movie.    The others actors did a great job playing their parts and the action was top notch. But they took way too many liberties in breaking from the story continuity of the comics. I tried giving this movie a chance after all the rumors and meet it with a open mind, and I did. I understand if they went to his childhood origin series and made it from front to back of the story that would be a whole other movie. That being said there was no mention of Rose who helped Logan escape from his home not Victor Creed that hit me like a hammer in the face considering that series was just out a few years ago.    They totally debunked the whole Weapon X series by Barry Winsor Smith with him volunteering for the Project. He was abducted against his will and forced into the project which not only builds more sympathy for Logan but builds on the tragedy of the hero. Silver Fox was from his distant past and her Death was a memory implant and not the reason for his sole hate for Sabertooth.     There intertwined family history was never fully established in the comics. But it is a fair and reasonable liberty to take to say that Victor Creed was Dog from origins and Wolverines Brother. They should have made this a R rated movie to truly do this justice like when James aka Logan kills his real Father when he 1st pops his claws they should have when by the books and had the mother call him an abomination and have her kill herself right in front of him with the shotgun since that was the beginning moment when James ceased to exist and Logan was born.      Last but not least that Adamantium round through the Adamantium laced skull thing to erase his Memory. Totally false when wolverine went up against Captain America his claws bounced off CapsAdamantium + Vibranium shield, and when going up against Cyber his old enemy with the Adamantium laced skin Wolverines claws bounced right off. In both cases Adamantium is unable to pierce through Adamantium. In short that bullet should have bounced right off not go through his skull, and Adamantium spine Hello no way you can decapitate him guys like you were wanting some of the actors to do in the movie.      For someone who never read Wolverine this is a great movie. For anyone who has ever read much of Wolverine this movie is a disaster and Marvel and the studio should have taken more care in making this true to the real story of Wolverine and not a quick Adaptation that strays to far from his real Origin.

B001EAWMGA|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised and pleased to view this DVD movie.  It's surely proof that a great movie does not have to be at the theater.  The story is superb and imaginative. A man from another world in out space crashes onto earth and finds himself among tribes of Vikings. A powerful evil creature plagues the area he now inhabits because it arrived with him unintentionally.  Feeling responsible, he is compelled to exterminate the beast. He will need help but he must earn the trust of the people around him because they recognize him to not be from any place near them; if they only knew.

0307454541|5.0|There are dysfunctional families and there are dysfunctional families. Then there's the Swedish Vanger family found in Stieg Larsson's novel. The Vangers take dysfunctionality to a whole new dimension.<br /><br />Henrik Vanger, 82, is the family patriarch. He is retired after running Vanger Industries for decades. Back in the fifties and sixties Vanger was a huge industrial combination, but there has been a steady decline in the various family interests since the seventies. Still, in 2002, when the novel is set, the family fortune is quite substantial.<br /><br />Henrik seems to be a regular fellow, but the Vanger clan has far more than its share of scoundrels. Henrik despises most of his relatives, but he values a few. One of his favorites was Henrietta, his grand niece, who mysteriously disappeared in 1966, when she was sixteen. Henrik became obsessed with determining her fate. He's convinced that she was murdered. However, no corpse was found. No firm evidence was uncovered.<br /><br />Early in the novel, Henrik hires Mikael Blomkvist. Blomkvist, a muckraking magazine editor, has just been convicted of criminal libel charges. He wrote a piece that strongly attacked the integrity of a leading Swedish financier, but did not substantiate his accusations in court. He received a three-month jail sentence and a large fine that drains his savings. Enter the picture Henrik, who offers Blomkvist a fortune to determine Henrietta's fate.<br /><br />The book is primarily a study of Blomkvist, 42, and his relationship with one Lisbeth Salander, 24, who assists him with the Henrietta Vanger investigation. Salander is very short and very thin, \\"waif-like.\\" She appears to be about fifteen, until one looks in her eyes and finds that they reflect a bitter life endured by a mature woman. She is eccentric, reclusive, and has a very hard time trusting anyone. She is also extremely intelligent and has remarkable investigative skills; it seems that she can uncover all that there is to know about anyone whom she targets, no matter how powerful the target and how determined the target might be to avoid scrutiny. Computers are her friends.<br /><br />Larsson brilliantly portrays Blomkvist, Salander, Henrik Vanger, and other key characters. He creates an intriguing mystery and presents a shocking solution. There is violence and there are graphic descriptions of abuse suffered by Salander.

B000YEUUCK|5.0|It's the best show I have ever seen in my live. The video quality is great. The sound is perfect. It is an incredible production and I am really glad with this product.
B000VSBX34|4.0|To commemorate the 40th anniversary of \\"Help!\\" in 2007, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame had an exhibit devoted to the movie.  The exhibit contained such things as props, copies of shooting schedules, and audio of radio advertisements.  At the end of the exhibit was a small theater which ran the movie continuously.  It is there that I saw part of \\"Help!\\" for the first time....and I was hooked immediately.  Not too long thereafter I saw the movie in it's entirety and kept asking myself why I had not seen the movie sooner.  Other reviews have pointed out the fact that The Beatles are not the best actors in the world.  While that is true, their very strong presence on the screen (and the fact that they clearly seem to be enjoying themselves from start to finish) more than makes up for that in my opinion.  \\"Help!\\" is just plain fun to watch.  From the excellent music (as well as the accompanying \\"videos\\") to the hysterical villains, to Eleanor Bron's great performance, there is a lot to like.  Definitely take the time to see this great movie.  You won't be disappointed.  KALEE!!!

B00005JN2Z|5.0|I saw this film a few years ago and decided to give it another look. While the film is contrived at times, it is helped greatly by a wonderfully cold performance by Tom Cruise. The film is well paced and builds slowly to an intense climax. Fox and Pickett should also be commended for turning in believable performances under crazy situations. The film probably rated a little over 4 stars, but the two discs DVD set is stellar and brings this super charged action film up to a top rating!
0061854549|5.0|I enjoyed this book in much the same way I enjoyed [[ASIN:0060731338 Freakonomics]]. Whereas Freakonomics explores real-life examples of economics, Ariely's book discusses experiments that demonstrate principles of behavioral economics.<br /><br />Ariely shows through a series of experiments that people are not the rational consumers of legend. People predictably overvalue things they already own, go after free things even if there's a better deal available, and do many other things that don't make sense. People's reactions are consistent, thus predictable, even if they're not optimal from a pure economic viewpoint - hence the title of \\"Predictably Irrational.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the book, Ariely discusses how the failure of many economists to consider behavioral economics has led companies and governments to bad decisions. Policies that seem appropriate if everyone were to make emotionless decisions fall apart when you consider that people are, well, human.<br /><br />In Ariely's acknowledgments, he lists several people who helped him figure out how to write in \\"non-academese.\\" Having read many books written by professors, I'd say he received excellent assistance in this area. His writing style is engaging and easy to follow.<br /><br />This was one of the best books I read this year.

B000ICLRIE|4.0|First and foremost, I enjoyed the original theatrical release, but once I saw the Director's Cut, I saw the epic that was intended, and it was good.<br /><br />But, since many have already lauded this version of the movie, I will focus on the Blu-Ray version:<br /><br />As mentioned before, this version allows you to play the complete Director's Cut without interruption and without changing discs.  Brilliant.  Picture quality appears clearer, and I felt that I was able to see a lot of the historical detail that Ridley Scott is known for putting in.  Thus, the environments are more realistic and it really puts you in the world as you follow Balian's journey.<br /><br />So, in a nutshell, Blu Ray is worth it.<br /><br />Why I don't give it 5 stars?  Because the incredible extra features from the 4-disc DVD set are nowhere to be seen on Blu Ray.  Apparently, the data to keep the Director's Cut on one disc used too much data for all of the extras included with that last DVD set produced.<br /><br />So, in another nutshell, keep, or get if you don't have it, the DVD 4-Disc Director's Cut version of the movie.  It may feel like double dipping, but each provides a unique viewing experience that I believe to be more than worth it.

0385504225|1.0|One word is enough: ridiculous. It's a pity because the plot could be nice, even if kidding the reader is never a good idea. But there are so many faults that sum up in a very poor result. Brown's problem is he is NOT Umberto Eco, so he can't invent books like Foucault's Pendulum or The Name of the Rose. Read the FP if you want a real esoteric thriller. After so many pages of symbols, personal stories, different narration planes Lost Symbol ends with the bad one dead, the good ones alive (against all odds and kidding the reader again)and the meaning of the book totally vanished. I read it in english for the first time, and I must say that the italian translations did Brown's writing a bad service. But the story is still non existing. Much ado about nothing.

0307269981|5.0|First, you should read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the first book by this author with the mysterious and compelling Lisbeth Salander as protagonist.  That book was a totally compelling read, way above the usual standard of character development for thrillers, with a complex and fascinating plot and characters that were totally real.  Sometimes a follow-up book disappoints, but not this one - it is every bit as compelling as the first book.  In this book the magazine editor Mikael Blomkvist again has an important role, as publisher of a book about human trafficking in Sweden.  When the journalists who are writing the book are killed, Lisbeth's fingerprints are found on the murder weapon, and her usual reluctance to cooperate with any authorities doesn't help her.  Mikael starts an investigation into Lisbeth's mysterious past in an effort to prove her innocence, which finally reveals what actually happened in \\"all that evil\\" - and it's a total surprise.  Let's hope for another book about these fascinating characters!

0143034901|5.0|At first, I was a little skeptical about reading The Shadow of The Wind. Based on the back cover's blurb, I got the impression it was a book about books in post-World War II Barcelona. Needless to say, it certainly would not have been my first choice had I seen it in the library. However, as I began to read, I fully began to understand why this novel received such incredible reviews across the board.<br /><br />The story begins with the protagonist Daniel Sempre, when he finds a book called The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax. The book's plot consumes Daniel, and he becomes determined to find the rest of Carax's novels. He soon discovers a mysterious man named Lain Coubert is destroying every copy of Carax's novels he can attain. From there, the story becomes one of forbidden love, betrayal, loyalty, hatred, fate, and curiosity. The plot is complex and intricate, yet is enthralling in a way that so many novels are not.<br /><br />Much like the novel within the novel, The Shadow of the WInd is a book which will mesmerize its reader. It is stories like this that truly live up the the saying \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\". Zafon's prose is incredibly well written, and The Shadow of The Wind deserves all of the positive reviews it has received.
B002BSHXJA|3.0|My coveted fellow Beatles fans, I have a mixed message to deliver to you regarding the recent issuing of the original mono mixes. Sir Paul McCartney may have only been about 21 years old when he wrote the couplet that I chose to title my review with, but how prophetic could he have been?  Moreso than even someone as immensely talented as he continues to be.  The Beatles, one of the greatest and most celebrated bands of the rock era, have finally have their catalog overhauled in a digital remastering job - making their mono albums available for the first time on CD (excepting the first four albums, which were always mono on CD).  Rather than the so-called Holy Grail (a blasphemous term if I've ever heard one, and a metaphor I am loathe to use myself), we have a day-old plate of soggy chow mein from Chef Chen's House of Ramen.  Allow me to elaborate, as I'm sure you expected.    Without question the first two Beatles albums, \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"With The Beatles\\", belong in mono and are much preferable to their stereo counterparts.  But once we move on to the four-track recordings of \\"Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Beatles For Sale,\\" it becomes no contest: stereo presents a more detailed and enveloping sonic experience.  Yes, the new mono remasters of these early classics are an improvement over the 1987 mono CDs, but alas they are buried six feet under by the new stereo remasters.      \\"Help\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" are best in the mono box set: but surprise, surprise!  Not because of the mono versions, but because we finally have the original stereo mixes!  Consider it a bonus if you must, the mono discs of these two peak-level Beatles albums contain two entirely different mixes of the album: both available on CD for the first time ever.  The mono versions are bad, don't get me wrong, but the original stereo mixes are (contrary to what the otherwise reliable George Martin has always maintained) superior to his 1987 remixes.  Those remixes are what was remastered for the new stereo releases.  We fans want the original goods!  I praised all the saints in heaven when I realized the undoctored stereo mixes were included.  Yes, for an older gal like me it can be partially chalked up to nostalgia for what I remember as a nubile lass.  But even heard through jaded, discerning adult ears: mama knows what she likes!!    You've heard the hype: \\"Revolver,\\" \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\", \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" and \\"The Beatles (White Album)\\" are all better in mono.  I respectfully disagree.  Now I'm not naysaying here.  There is nothing 'wrong' per se with the mono mixes of these true gems.  They are different, sometimes notably so, but more often in subtle ways that only the more obsessive fans among us will notice (much less jump with glee about).  I prefer certain songs in their stereo mix, while others work better in mono.  But it will be a very subjective process to sort through all this material and I doubt the majority of fans will want to spend the money or even have the time to invest in such minutiae.      \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is glorious is stereo, cramped and claustrophobic in mono.  \\"Savoy Truffle\\" packs a harder, tighter punch in mono than in stereo.  \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\" sounds generally better in stereo - but, the \\"Mother Superior jump the gun\\" segment is far more powerful in mono.  \\"Fixing A Hole\\" has more prominent hi-hat in mono, but is it better or preferable to the stereo (which features bolder-sounding lead guitar)?  The list can go on and on.  Mainly I would say these two different reissues provide more fodder for Beatlemaniac arguments than anything else.    See, when I was attending the previous church to the one I now go to (which is on-line, thankfully), the pastor once displayed a slide-show depicting which bands were \\"leaders\\" in the Satanic parade.  Well, needless to say the Beatles were at the front of the line - decked out in full Sgt. Pepper regalia - based on the number of youths they influenced to experiment with drugs and promiscuous lewd behavior.  I'm not agreeing with it, as I did eventually withdraw my membership from that church, siting the slide-show as a primary reason.  I will say that there is something a tad devilish is making such an expensive boxset for a product that doesn't really warrant ownership by anyone save for the hardest of hardcore fanatics.  Yes, I bought it.  But yes, I also feel extremely guilty about the purchase (even though I am happy to have those \\"Help\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" original stereo mixes).  The Beatles have been airbrushed, image-wise, over the years to the point where they resemble something Disneyesque rather than the Satan worshippers that some men of the cloth would have us believe.  But even the late Uncle Walt D. himself had his dark side, something to keep in mind before plunking down hundreds of dollars.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Personally i liked this book, it is the kind of stuff i like to read. It definitely wasn't the same kind of masterpiece that i thought Angels and Demons or The Da Vinci Code was. It was somewhat predictable and followed closely to the Dan Brown formula. When his first books came around, it was something fresh. After reading those two, there wasn't anything unique about the lost symbol. It was Angles and Demons basically taking place in DC. It seemed Dan Brown wanted to put as much of his research into the book as possible. Sometimes it didn't seem integral to the plot, more like it was just shoved in there so that the research wasn't done for nothing. At the same time, I still loved it and couldn't put it down.

But then towards the end, everything just falls apart.     There is too much of one person lecturing another person. And the ending was just deflated totally. I wanted so much to like it, because it was set up well in the beginning, and it had a lot of potential. It went nowhere though and didn't satisfy the suspense it built.

B0025VLELQ|4.0|In an era of whizz-bang special effects, this 25th anniversary release takes us back to a simple, good-fun, entertaining movie.  It has a lot of issues to challenge us and there is a subtle movement of entering us into \\"real-life\\" issues and then immersing us into the world of the video machine game.  We become part of both.  It is not a heavy, statement-making movie....it simply entertains.  But having said that, we are confronted (in a non-confronting manner) with the challenge to accept others who differ from us.  I particularly liked the way it looked at the subject of taking hold of a situation which presents itself and turning it into a positive outcome.    The Trailer-Park boy wants to escape his restricted life and reaches for a college life beyond the expectations of he and his peers.  When a letter arrives shattering his dreams, he little realizes how a much bigger horizon has opened up.  It was good to travel back in time to a movie that was looking ahead in time and reminding us of a different era...

0385504225|1.0|Like so many others, I hoped that this would be another fantastic episode in the life of Robert Langdon. It wasn't. The most distressing part of the book is that, unlike his previous books, Brown presented virtually no history or mythology about his chosen subject (Freemasonry and the United States) except occasional minutiae and Internet-search trivia matched with his paternal narrative warnings not to judge the Freemasons and their past. Whose wandering opinions was Brown trying to nanny back into check, ours or his? His pro-Freemasonic lecturing got tedious to the point of insulting. Don't look for anything but the most vague connection between Freemasonry and the Morgan Affair, the Mormon Church, Albert Pike and his connection to Confederate secret societies, or even the obvious, the Founders. This book becomes Brown's most violent yet. Apparently he forgot how to write suspense and action into a scene without resorting to Ripperological detail. Finally, all but the last 100 pages are reminiscent of Keystone Cops antics. Chasing, racing, stumbling, dark streets and confusion -- all without the usual Langdon expertise to explain it. Brown's lead character seems just as befuddled with his new mysteries and he is. Meanwhile, the audience of readers resort to thinking for both gentlemen and silently scream \\"Don't go in there!\\" as well as \\"Don't write that!\\" The predictability of the book's plot is its undoing. Void of any nuance between good and evil, simple and complex, or even fact and fiction, the readers are left to fend for themselves in a meaningless carnival of violence and moral lecturing. A more satisfying and sensible adventure would be to re-read an earlier Brown book and mentally substitute \\"Freemason\\" for every reference to \\"Priory\\" and \\"Illimunati.\\"

0439023491|5.0|I have been anxiously awaiting \\"Catching Fire\\" by Suzanne Collins for so long!  I count \\"The Hunger Games\\" as one of my all-time favorite reads and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it's sequel.  This book was definitely worth the wait!  Suzanne Collins has created a world that draws you in completely.  I became totally invested in each character and read the book at a furious pace in order to see the outcome for all of them.  The book has so many plot twists that I didn't see coming!<br /><br />The book begins shortly after the last Hunger Games ended.  Katnis and Peeta are preparing for their \\"victory tour\\" through the districts.  In order to survive the last games, Katnis and Peeta convinced the world that they were in love with one another and challenged the Capitol by forcing them to declare two winners or they would kill themselves and there would be no winner.  The scheme worked and they were both crowned victors.  Unfortunately, forcing the Capitol's hand to do anything has dire consequences!  Katnis realizes how dire these consequences could be in \\"Catching Fire\\".  While preparing for her tour she gets an unlikely visitor who informs her of potential rebellion in the districts.  This is said to be a result of her and Peeta's actions in the arena.  She now must convince the world that the love between her and Peeta is real or everything and everyone she loves will suffer.  Katnis had hoped to return to her \\"old\\" life after the games- one that included Gale, her best friend/soulmate, but once again the Capitol is controlling her life.  She is forced to publicly profess her undying love to Peeta and become a pawn in the Capitol's game again.<br /><br />The journey this book takes you on is intense!  It is a rollercoaster of action, anger, manipulation, rebellion, romance, betrayal and suspense.  While reading I felt like I was there in Panem.  The author has created a vivid world and the characters are so well developed that you feel strongly for them.  I loved every page of \\"Catching Fire\\"  and am once again on pins and needles waiting for the next one!ed every page of \\"Catching Fire\\"  and am once again on pins and needles waiting for the next one!
0307341569|4.0|DARK PLACES by Gillian Flynn lived up to it's title, but not in the way I first expected.  This is not so much a story about devil worship (it's publisher's blurb suggests) as it is about poverty and where it can lead under the worst circumstances.  I love the protagonist, Libby Day, she is outside the box of conventional main characters.  Short, plain looking, and without much of a will to do anything, she listlessly cashes checks from a fund created for her after the murder of her family.  And she is mean, without apology.  It is through her history that you become sympathetic, you get the feeling she never really had a chance.  Even if her mother and sisters were not murdered, her brother in prison for committing the crime, you get the idea her life would have been one filled with sorrow and desperation.  The Day family are poor, their clothes aren't new, the son is a janitor at his own high school.  Things are okay for the girls in grade school, but the pressures of high school under such circumstances, along with a penchant for bad luck, quickly put the family on the path to total destruction.  Along with this great social commentary is a pretty solid mystery.  If the book was strong throughout, the ending cinched my feelings that this is a book to be had!
1439138311|2.0|This book hooked me right away; however, the more I read, the less I liked it. Eilis, the main character, seems to sleepwalk through life, unaware of or unconcerned by the ramifications of both her actions and her inactions! By the end of the book, her thoughtlessness and lack of honor had negated any empathy I might have had for her.     The author, Colm Tóibín, never achieves what one editorial review claims -- ... \\"a renewed understanding that to emigrate is to become a foreigner in two places at once.\\" Nor does he evoke what the Washington Post review \\"the deep homesickness...\\" of Irish immigrants. Frankly, the main character, Eilis, never seems to care that much about home or Brooklyn. She seems to simply let things happen rather than accept responsibility and take action. Her lack of concern for everyone in her life -- family, friends, boy friends, employers, landlord, priest -- is appalling.     A great disappointment...
B0007TKNL0|5.0|When I first saw this movie it was from Music Of The Night on. I didn't really appreciate at first mostly because I had only seen it from then on. I watched it the whole way through a little while later and was and still am completely blown away. Emmy Rossum's voice is beautiful. Raou's voice fits his character wonderfully. And The Phantom Of The Opera's voice mesmerizes, moves, and captivates me in a way that no words can really describe. This movie changed my life. I will never stop loving the haunting music or how romantic it is. I will keep watching the movie and keep seeing it onstage for as long as I can. If you haven't seen this movie (and not to be rude) then I don't know what you're doing with your life. I really have no idea.

1594488916|3.0|Drive by any flea market and you will see ample evidence that for any object you can think of, there is someone somewhere assembling a collection of it. When it comes to collecting books I can easily sympathize, up to a point. As much as I love books, as much as I've probably spent on books in my lifetime there is just no way I can see myself collecting first editions. Too expensive, too risky and too much space required. None of this, however, was a barrier to book thief extraordinaire John Charles Gilkey.    Barlett dives into the world of rare books, bibliomania and biblio larceny to tell the story of Gilkey, a genuine oddball who despite having no money, no fixed address and no clue sets out to amass a collection of first editions that will wow the world. The fact that Gilkey thinks the world will care gives a hint of what we are dealing with here. The additional fact that Gilkey steals the books and simultaneously feels aggrieved is impressive but only in the same way that it was impressive to see the driver of a Honda Civic, having cut off another car, spit on said car because the other driver dare to blow their horn. And that's one of the major hurdles of this double-spaced, generously margined book: readers will find themselves wanting to smack some sense into this dimwit.    The other main character, Ken Sanders, is an oddball of another sort but an honest and forthright oddball. He's easily one of the sanest people in the book and based on what's in the book, saner than the author. This book is written in the \\"Let Me Tell You How I Wrote This\\" style, with the author front and center telling us what she thought, felt, ate, etc. My tolerance for such ventures is low. Bartlett does a good job with this when she's ruminating on what books have meant to her, she does less well when she's telling us about all the books she read as research for this book. I'm glad her library card got a workout but a little narrative cohesion would be nice. So would a little self-awareness.    When Bartlett begins hanging out with Gilkey she seems weirdly unaware that something isn't right with him. She's trying to figure out the logic of what Gilkey does. From his first words to her it's apparent that logic isn't Gilkey's strong point so I kept wondering when Bartlett would clue in to this. When she goes to one of the bookstores Gilkey stole from with Gilkey so that Gilkey can show her how he shops, or some such silliness, I wanted to remind her that being a journalist doesn't require the removal of one's spine. Just say no, Allison. Thankfully, Ken Sanders sets her straight.    It is a rare thing to read an article in a magazine and wish it were longer. Not having reading Allison Hoover Bartlett's original article on the subject, I don't know if The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is eagerly awaited by readers. It's a short book and an easy read. It is also the first book I've read in which the author shares her experience of removing her bra via her shirtsleeve in her car outside a California state prison. I won't be too sad if it is the last.    Recommended for anyone interested in the world of rare books.
B000YI7MRM|2.0|The Alatriste books are wonderful, amazing historical recreations, brilliantly plotted and intricate mysteries. I had high hopes for this movie, which clearly had a substantial budget. Viggo Mortensen is perfectly cast as Alatriste. However, the filmmakers erred by trying to compress the entire series into one movie. It plays like an outline or summary. There is little character development and less coherency. A much better approach would have been to focus only on the first novel and produce a faithful adaptation. Even if Mortensen (or funding) proved unavailable for sequels, that would have been a far more satisfying movie.    All this being said, the movie looks great. I believed I was looking at early 17th century Spain (and Flanders). I believed that the characters represented authentic types. As a fencer, I was less pleased with the fight scenes, which mostly seemed rushed and perfunctory and not convincingly choreographed.     Recommendation: See it for the recreation of Spain as it began to decline from its peak of glory, and for Viggo Mortensen wearing one of the great movie moustaches of all time. Just don't expect greatness.

B0021L8US0|1.0|I'm such a major scifi fan that I even enjoy some B-movie scifi's, so I'm not that hard to please. However this movie was disturbing and dull. There was not one character in the movie that we could care about. The lead character was kind of unlikable and uninteresting. The aliens were repulsive, base and the majority were stupid. The one smart alien was undeveloped as a character, and not very interesting. The human criminals were just as repulsive as the aliens. The rest of the human characters were equally shallow, unlikable and unbelievable.<br /><br />A good scifi takes you into another reality and lets you believe it for a couple of hours. A good story makes you care about something. This movie did neither of those things. There was plenty of disturbing gore and violence which I would have overlooked if the movie was good, but it wasn't. The word that came to mind for us when we left was \\"creepy\\". If you're very curious, wait for the DVD rental.

B001PR0YFS|2.0|Despite all the negative reviews we saw this movie. That's because the trailers looked so compelling, fun and interesting. Also we really enjoy Matt Damon and Scott Bakula. Apparently the marketing department must have watched the movie and decided that the trailer had to be very different from the actual movie to sell tickets. From a video production and marketing standpoint they did a masterful job! However the trailers took the clips out of context and joined together clips that didn't really belong together. It was creative, but very misleading.<br /><br />The movie was not a comedy, and there were no real laughs. It was a drama, but very little happens in the two hours. It was quite dull. Matt Damon and Scott Bakula were outstanding actors as usual. There were many appearances by actors that you'll recognize such as the Smothers Brothers, the guy who played Biff on Back to the Future, etc. However if I had been watching this movie on DVD, I would have turned it off maybe 1/3 of the way, because it was just not interesting.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|This band has grown to nothing short of pure genius (and I'm not exaggerating), and this album is yet another incredible example of their ability. No two Muse albums are the same, so everyone is going to have different favorites. Their sound is big and wonderfully dramatic at times, addictive and catchy at others, and just down right BEAUTIFUL the rest of the time. I love the occasional Queen influence that pops up in this album, as I think it fits in perfectly with their sound and they don't overdo it.   The entire album is just a stellar, stellar attempt, but I have to say that I have a particular fondness for I BELONG TO YOU. The French influence, the lyrics, and the arrangement of that song just strikes me in such a unique, wonderful way. I've also gotta say that I love how they almost let themselves say their band's name in the song, but not quite, sort of like, \\"We'll almost go there, but not all the way, but you know what we were gonna say.\\" It tickles me every time.    This is a DEFINITE MUST HAVE for those who are particular fans of 'Absolution' and 'Black Holes and Revelations.'
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I'm embarrassed to admit that I was completely unaware of this album until literally the day it came out.  I'm not worthy, Dave!!  Though I supposed I at least managed to spare myself the months of agonizing anticipation.  Anyway, let's get to it.  Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, Mustaine has been moving the band in this direction since The World Needs a Hero back in 2001, and he certainly wasn't following Metallica's lead in releasing this album (though the comparisons between the Black Album and Countdown are right on the money).  United Abominations was promised to be a complete return to form after not quite getting there with Hero and The System Has Failed.  While there's a lot to like on UA, there are also a lot of very average tracks and some that, while containing great moments, completely lack any kind of structure or direction (You're Dead and Burnt Ice come to mind).    So 2 1/2 after being somewhat disappointed by Abominations, I found myself trying to find the release date for Slayer's next album, only to discover that (GASP!!) Megadeth was releasing a new album that very day!!!  And the reviews were stellar!!  During my two hour commute home from work, I had plenty of time to wonder if Megadeth would finally deliver.  Within the first 30 seconds of Dialectic Chaos, I knew that this album was a whole other animal than anything that had been released after Rust In Peace.  By the end of 1320, I had a big smile that didn't leave my face for two days.  This is the album that Dave Mustaine has been trying to make for nearly a decade now.  There are songs that shred like it's 1985 (This Day We Fight!!, 1320, Endgame, Head Crusher), there are mid-tempo rockers that top anything they did in that vein during the 90s (44 Minutes Bodies, How the Story Ends), there's even a track that wouldn't feel too out of place on Youthanasia (The Hardest Part of Letting Go), the band's best non-thrash record, in my opinion.  Is it perfect? No, I'm not too big on Bitethe Hand and I'm still not sure what I think of Right to go Insane, but there's no such thing as a flawless Megadeth record.    The band may be little more than Dave and his revolving door of hired guns these days, but if there's one thing that can be counted on, it's that he'll give it 110%.  This time, he nailed it.  Rejoice and rattle your god damn head!!

0307454541|5.0|I was curious to see that this book seems to have inspired quite a few mixed reviews. Which in turn inspires me to cover a few warning points for the potential reader:<br /><br />1.<br />It isn't the most fast-paced of mysteries. The story knits together several quite divergent themes and it requires quite a bit of back story to accomplish its task. I enjoyed it, but if you prefer your thrillers/mysteries taut or want all your information revealed through dialogue, then this is most likely not the book for you.<br /><br />2.<br />One of the themes that Larsson develops clearly has to do with sexuality, power imbalance, and violence. Personally, I think that he treats the subject very well. Some good things-- women over 35 have charisma, and a sex life, and attract lovers. A wonderful change from the persistent trope that matches the hero in his late 40s with the super scientist/astronaut/top academic who just happens to be a permanent 32.<br /><br />There are also relationships depicted between younger women (early 20s) and older men. Unusually for me, I appreciated the way that this is handled by the text. Particularly with the character of Lisbeth Salander you see the power imbalances and problems that these relationships can bring. It's also very hard to disconnect the \\"good\\" relationship that she has with an older man from the abusive ones that she experiences. I think that the tension is deliberate, and very smart. This said, there are images here that could be read in a variety of ways and that could potentially be triggering for a reader. Some scenes are quite explicit, and very disturbing.<br /><br />3.<br />This is a book in translation, and that always loses something. Reg Keeland seems to have done a good job (at least a Swedish friend of mine thinks so) but there is a kind of inevitable flattening of dialogue that is difficult to avoid. It will read differently than a book by a native English writer.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book and am looking forward to both reading the sequel and seeing the film. It kept me well entranced for several days. I'd recommend it-- bearing the caveats above in mind.ng the film. It kept me well entranced for several days.

B002GZQYMK|4.0|The reviews here, and elsewhere, have been wildly mixed regarding the new Muse CD. It's as if, for some, the direction the CD took held off the Second Coming.  Personally speaking, I find it overall bold, brash, and completely stunning in many parts.  Yes, in some places it is derivative and self-indulgent, and while it doesn't hold up to their best work from earlier this decade (arguably, Origin of Symmetry), it still rises above the now-comparatively-pedestrian Black Holes and Revelations to be a flawed almost masterpiece with a level of humanity missing from previous Muse records.<br /><br />A track by track breakdown:<br /><br />1. Uprising: With the sole exception of the absolutely ecclesiastical Knights of Cydonia, Muse's singles have been rather boring as of late, and this one is no exception.  Throbbing Goldfrapp base sits below Matt Bellamy's low growl, as he bellows out marching orders for the \\"Uprising\\". Guitar solo is the best thing about this.  A rather unfortunate start to the proceedings, but then we get into...<br /><br />2.  Resistance: A haunting synth begins this rather urgent, Orwell-influenced ode to forbidden love.  Sure, the lyrical content is silly (\\"Love is Our Resistance\\" - really, now), but the aching piano, slashing guitars and sweet base make up for it.  Beautiful.<br /><br />3.  Undisclosed Desires: In my mind, the CD could have done without this song.  I frankly did not like \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" when it was first released, and this Timbaland-esque attempt to ape it does NOT get my sexy on.  Sorry...<br /><br />4.  The United States of Eurasia:  Yep, the big \\"Queen\\" track. One gets the feeling that Mr. Bellamy is still not a fan of American foreign policy (or the EU, for that matter), as every conspiracy theory about world domination you can think of influences the lyrics of this profoundly silly, yet mesmerizing, superb and thundering track (Dom Howard is the showcase, here; that guy can play!).  The piece 'd resistance of the CD, it then melds into \\"Collateral Damage\\", a take on Chopin's Nocturne with dulcette strings backing some gorgeous piano.  A few rocket blasts later and then we are into...<br /><br />5.  Guiding Light: Time to haul out the acid-wash jeans, the cut-up tops and the cigarette lighters.  A track that would have not sounded out of place on any Warrant or Poison album from 20 years ago, the 80'ish echo and hum resounding throughout this \\"power ballad\\" seem to belie a story about profound rejection.  Others have said that this is the worst track on the CD.  I personally appreciate the kitsch factor.  It makes me giggle.<br /><br />6. Unnatural Selection: Some have complained that the guitar riff on the chorus is too similar to \\"New Born\\" from Origin of Symmetry.  To me, that's a minor quibble.  A larger one for me is the length of the piece, as well as many other pieces on the CD.  One of the reasons Muse is so brilliant is their ability to take all that prog-rock pomp and circumstance and neatly place it within the confines of a three to four minute song.  With a couple of exceptions, every song on this CD is 5 to 8 minutes long.  For songs such as this, as well as MK Ultra, that rely on heavy guitars, it gets to be a bit much.  However, the nasty, sweaty, dirty blues breakdown in the middle of this track is to die for.  Bellamy, if nothing else, can throw down a hell of a blues riff.<br /><br />7. MK Ultra: Another track that this CD could have done without.  It's not as terrible as Undisclosed Desires, but, after Unnatural Selection, it's heavy hammer guitarwork and rhythms just seem as more of the same. Again, wearing. In fact, the only interesting thing about the track is the title itself, which references a secret CIA experiment on American citizens that took place between the 1950's and 1970's.<br /><br />8. I Belong To You [+Mon Coeur S'Ouvre A Ta Voix]: Perhaps the most controversial track on the CD, I've read elsewhere of it being rather slight R&B.  To me, it sounds more as a Bertol Brecht update, during which Bellamy channels his inner Edith Piaf in the middle where the pace slows to a crawl and he starts emoting in French to an aria from \\"Samson and Delilah\\". Sure, it's laughable and kitschy, but perhaps, after the Sturm und Drang of the previous two tracks, that's the point.  It also sounds as if the band had the best time in the recording studio, doing this song.<br /><br />9-11. Exogenesis, Parts 1 to 3.  This part of the CD has been hyped as a symphony.  To me, it sounds less as a symphony, and more as a three part mini-opera, with Bellamy playing the everyman surrounded by war and conspiracy and waiting for the aliens (or some superhumans) to take him off the planet and put him down elsewhere.  While it's not exactly Bizet or Wagner, or even Puccini, the three part \\"opera\\" (I'm not calling it a symphony, people) effectively uses Bellamy's classical and modern classical influences, with room for Dom Howard and Chris Wolstensone to have some say in the matter. The string arrangements, alone, are amazing.<br /><br />So, in the end, The Resistance is a sprawling, ambitious CD that, if it falls short of expectations, it's only because it perhaps tries to do too much with too many genres within the traditional album format.  As it was self-produced, all indulgences were taken, and then some.

1605092762|5.0|This book is a \\"beyond five stars\\" book and will be so rated at Phi Beta Iota, the Public Intelligence Blog where I can do things Amazon does not provide for, including reader access to my 1400+ non-fiction reviews via any of 100 different categories.<br /><br />This single man, this author, has lifted 17 million people out of poverty by focusing on the needs of the one-acre and below subsistence farmer living on $1 a day.  I get goose-bumps just thinking about the magnitude of both the accomplishment, and the implications of the accomplishment.<br /><br />Early on he talks about \\"Open Eyes\\" and I am adding this to my \\"Open Everything\\" presentation.  I am completely absorbed by both his twelve-step description of achieving human to human communications and understanding of what is needed by the bottom billion, and his concise, respectful, but devastatingly brutal description of all of the international assistance and donor managers as being largely cut off from reality, persisting in offering HOME country solutions without even understanding the HOST country problems.  I a most impressed that this book and the thirty years invested by the author in this work is based on LISTENING to 3,000 poor farming families.<br /><br />Two huge bottom lines permeate the book:<br /><br />1)  COST MATTERS.  Subsistence farmers can afford $2-50 dollars depending on how it can visibly be seen as contributing to their getting a return on investment.<br /><br />2)  MONEY WORKS.  The author is politely brutal in observing that the UN Millenium Goals are unachievable as things now stand for the simple reason that they try to impose solutions by sector rather than focusing on the common denominator for achieving all of the UN Millineum Goals: increase subsistence wages from $1 to $3, $4, $5 dollars a day, and the beneficiaries, who are VERY intelligent, VERY creative, VERY hard-working, make their own logical choices and invest quickly in education, health, sanitation, etc.<br /><br />The author focuses early on the myths of poverty, such as the myth that one can donate the world out of poverty. or that big business will eventually turn its attention to the lower end of the marketplace.  While the author is critical of C. K. Prahalad and the book that made me into \\"intelligence officer to the poor,\\" I speak of course of [[ASIN:0131877291 The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits]], he does attend to the work and I am happy to blend the best from both of them.<br /><br />The author is most compelling in observing that the poorest of the poor have what Buckminster Fuller would call TIME-ENERGY that can be brought to bear at a cost of 5 to 10 cents on the hour (it takes ten minutes to earn a dollar in the USA, two days to earn a dollar in Bangladesh).  His goal is to reach 500 million FAMILIES with low cost pumps, low cost latrines, low cost drip irrigation etc.<br /><br />On page 52 he quotes someone else on the matter of the poor being poor in part because they have no voice in the circles of power, and I start thinking CISCO-NOKIA and make a list: voice; access, education (one cell call at a time, a concept pioneered by the Earth Intelligence Network), health information, certification as an organic producer, information about meeting quality stnadards for wholesalers, even the transfer of money TO the cell phone.<br /><br />Three words recur:  AFFORDABILITY, MINIATURIZATION, and EXPANDABLE.  Affordable to someone who makes $1 a day; small enough to be effective on a courtyard plot or land, a rooftop garden, or a quarter acre plot; and easily expandable so that profit and success can go outwards from the kernel.<br /><br />The author points out that only 1% of all farming today is using drip irrigation, and that if we could reach the billion extreme poor that do not, this would be a double-win.<br /><br />He also focused on water storage, including through the direction of monsoon waters into wells and thus back into the aquifer, and I am hugely impressed that he cites a Hindu religious organization that made this one their missions and it worked--in the same country, India, where aquifers have been dropping a meter a year.<br /><br />I learn the landless are not actually landless--from rooftop to side yard to \\"open land\\" they can earn money if given the tools and knowledge.  Diluted urine can be a substitute for fertilizer.  Family wash water can go into irrigation.<br /><br />He lists the following obstacles, and after each one I enter \\"Nokia\\" for two reasons: one, I know Nokia is thinking about this, and two, I believe Nokia needs to make the leap from one call at a time to World Brain.<br /><br />Lack of Hope --  Nokia<br /><br />Clouded Vision  --  Nokia<br /><br />No Intellectual Property Protection  --  Nokia<br /><br />Subsidies Killing Innovation  --  Nokia<br /><br />Corruption  --  Expose it via Nokia<br /><br />Isolation  --  Nokia<br /><br />Lack of Information --  NOKIA<br /><br />Poor Access to Credit  --  Nokia<br /><br />The author provides a RIVETING description of all that he and his partners did to education millions, including traveling entertainment troupes and a full-length movie with top Bangladesh actors featuring the treadle pump as a persistent sub-plot.<br /><br />He spends time on low end transport including motorcycle trailers, Chinese rototiller trailers, donkey carts, and richshaw vans, and in passing notes that 1 billion people are out there who would pay $2 for a pair of corrective glasses, in the case of a farmer, vital to know what seed is in what package.<br /><br />He discussed value-added processing, e.g. drying and husking nuts at the point of pick-up, which reduces transport volume and cost as well as rot damage.<br /><br />Chapter 9 focuses on slums as enterprise zones and there is a wealth of information here, enough to inspire an entire new cadre of poverty-eradication entrepreneurs.<br /><br />On page 186 he notes the two major flaws of all international development assistance has been first, going through (corrupt and ineffective) governments; and second lack of metrics to assure productive outcomes.  This validates the Peer to Peer giving initiatives that are emerging, and I just think to myself that what we really need is a Global Range of Needs Table that is universal and can connect the billion rich (80% of whom do not give to organized charities) directly with the five billion poor, to include ad hoc team giving (Tanzanian farmer needs part for 1950's Rumanian water pump; tourist load need; Rumanian engineer offers up part; German pays for FedEx, NGO worker agrees to receive and deliver and post completion photo).<br /><br />The book gains from the interweaving of a single family as a case study, experiencing a ten fold increase in annual income over the course of years (more than three, less than a decade).<br /><br />The conclusion is brilliant and effective, and in particular related the eradication of poverty to each of the other major goals (climate change, biodiversity, global pandemic, education).  There is no question but that the UN High Level Panel got it right in making Poverty the number one high-level threat to humanity, and this author's work is priceless in offering up a proven solution and proven route to eradicating poverty.<br /><br />I put the book down thinking to myself, \\"End the Fed, End the UN, End Big Government.\\"  It is now very clear that these large organizations do not adapt, do not scale, and are too easily corrupted.  Instead, peer to peer, full disclosure and transparency, and bottom up solutions appear to be needed if we are to evolve beyond our current paradigm of Big Government, Banks Too Big to Fail, and Rule By Secrecy/Empire Over Democracy.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|I just want to say that this is one of the most brilliant works of mankind, and for people to give it a one star review because they can't get the cd to play on their computer are complete jerks and morons.<br /><br />The stupidity!
044651652X|2.0|I got this book after loving the movie with Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, but the book is just too slow.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|What a mess they have made of the 007 franchise.  I grew up with Bond in the late 60's and 70's with the Sean Connery and Roger Moore versions of the secret agent and like many fans of this series take comfort in the formula that made it great.  With Quantum of Solace (as in Casino Royale) I'm presented with something claiming to be a James Bond movie that is all but unrecognizable as one.  The big opening scene featuring a Bond getaway is just another car chase.  And the car, yes he's got an Aston Martin but it's simply a fast car, no gadgets, nothing special and the director seems determined to wreck it as quickly as possible.  Speaking of gadgets, \\"Q\\" is dead and our current J.B. is left to fend for himself just like any other Joe.  The iconic James Bond theme is relegated to the closing credits along with the trademark view through the gun barrel sequence that launched the previous films.  Love Dame Judi Dench in other roles, hate her as \\"M\\".  Daniel Craig's 007 is a charmless, humorless murdering robot; no snappy double entendres from this super spy.  Someone must have felt a little guilt after the last movie so they've tossed in a couple of nods to the past; a bartender recites the Bond martini recipe and Craig uses a Walter PPK in a few scenes.  You have the homage to Goldfinger, but with oil this time around substituting for gold.  I found the plot difficult, if not impossible to follow, as if the screenplay was written by a collection of drunks on a weekend bender.  Like all the past movies at the end of the credits it says \\"James Bond will return\\"; if only he would.
B000002UB3|5.0|Decided to take a trip down memory lane.  Chose the best vehicle.  I had forgotten how much I loved this album.  Great fun going over the songs with my granddaughter and grandson.  This music lives on and on.  One of the best Beatle albums in my opinion.
0143034901|4.0|Shadow of the Wind was my assigned summer reading book. Like most summer reading, it was difficult to build up enough motivation to read the book. After 100 pages or so, I put the book down thinking it was boring. After a month or so I decided to keep reading it. Turns out after the first 100 pages, it the story becomes one full of suspense and mystery. I liked how the reader was kept guessing who was burning the books, and Carlos Zafron's unique writing style really makes you think. If there is a school out there looking for their 2010 summer reading book, this is the one.
B001GCUO1Q|2.0|There are few things I hate than popping in a DVD and watching a two-hour movie go by while trying to watch it with two huge black bands on the top and bottom. Okay, maybe it's too much to hope for full screen versions of movies, but how about a more realistic ratio, like 16:9, where you can see what's going on? People with high definition are going to be ordering in in Blu-Ray, and converting the movie to one's MP4 player is a waste of effort (if the movie was worth the effort in the first place).<br /><br />In short, either produce the movie in full screen edition or at least have it available in both. Or just use a 16:9 for everything.<br /><br />They can keep their product. I'll rent it if I feel like watching it.

0385504225|3.0|I had great hopes for this book even though I found the Davinci Code not as good as Angels and Demons.I was really disappointed in this book.I thought authors were supposed to get better from book to book I feel he is getting worse.The characters are boring other than Langdon (Who I love as usual) and you don't really care what happens to them I agree with another reviewer that Katherine is an idiot to let this guy into her precious lab after receiving only a text message supposedly from her brother.The other two books had great villains that were the fronts for the real villain This one has a supposed bad villain who is just stupid and a zealot who is a front for no one he is just an idiot who wants power BORING.I am sorry I had to rate the book this way I love Angels and Demons and this was just plain disappointing.If you like the other two by all means read this one but don't get your expectations too high

0792164903|4.0|It's been ten years since this cool Johnny Depp film came to play and it's still as fun and as comedic as they come.<br /><br />Loosely based on the Washington Irving tale, Tim Burton wanted to make a story that woudl be a horror tale, great texture and capturing some 18th century wildness.<br /><br />Oddly, this story reminded me of Columbo, kind of like an 18th century Columbo.  Similar in a lot of ways with the conspiracy theories, the four Sleepy Hollow conspirators, and the fact that Icabod's scientific know-how falls prey to an actual horror, the headless horseman.<br /><br />The Danny Elfman score adds to the mystery of the horseman.  Rated \\"R\\" most likely because of all the heads being lopped off, quite cleanly I might add.<br /><br />The detective mystery aspect is fascinating since I did not see that ending coming.  Christina Ricci plays a naive girl who dabbles in witchcraft and Icabod faints at the sight of spiders and corpses.<br /><br />Great flick for a Halloween night.<br /><br />The DVD has some cool extras, such as an interview with the cast and crew and you really get into Burton's head and see what he was all about, plus film trailers and such.<br /><br />Uncredited appearance by Martin Landau in the beginning of the film, and a short but masterful rendition of a court judge by Christopher Lee.<br /><br />To add, the photography was the best.  The deep, muted colors throughout the film gave it a moody, depressing look.  After the evil is banished at the end, all is bright and autumn red colors.  Yeah, a bit corny but interesting play of color and light.<br /><br />Other Burton Films Recommended:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000P0J074 Beetlejuice]]<br />[[ASIN:B000VDDWDI Edward Scissorhands [Blu-ray]]]
B00005K3O4|4.0|Yep.  Hard to tell if it is serious or what.  Closer to the serious part.  Because the clowns are kind of eerie.  Brings back memories of girls with big hair!!!
B000N196CO|4.0|While this is not my favorite Démy film, it has many virtues. Strangely enough, its virtues are also its vices. For one thing, the strict visual adherence to the feeling and emotional scope of the comic book gives it an extraordinary flatness which is not suited so well to dramatic live-action narrative. The lead actress, Catriona MacColl, is so flat that she almost seems like a drawing, as does her pretty-boy long-term love. The extremely fetishistic gender and sexual issues would be better dealt with in a more adult way in a live action film, and yet doing so would take the film way outside of the scope of the comic book in an uncomfortable and perverse way. There was no attempt to make the lovely MacColl look like a boy when she is supposed to pass for one (she wears mascara, lipstick, and eyeshadow throughout, and her long blonde curled hair spills behind her in a loose ponytail), and yet she looks exactly like the starry-eyed heroine of the comic book. In a couple of scenes Démy alludes to her sexuality as a woman, as in one scene where a man looks in on her undressing and sees her topless, and in another where she rebukes the advances of a depraved nobleman by kissing a woman in public to the shock of the entire court, but the mix of the childlike and the adult is quite odd and I think would seem off-putting to many viewers. MacColl's flat performance is in contrast to Christine Böhm's rounder, more believable comic performance as Marie Antoinette, and yet her flatness also directly relates to her being raised as a boy, and being trained by her father not to display feminine emotions. (\\"I have trained my daughter not to cry!\\") So we have a character that is bound to behave unnaturally, as she is a total construction, a boy that is not a boy. The end result of all this is that we have this gorgeous confection of a movie, filmed partly at Versailles, with all of the depth of a pink frosted birthday cake. And yet we have weird psychological issues, like a father insisting on raising his daughter as a boy without considering the long-term effects, and then later fighting a duel with her. We have a person who is gender indeterminate at all times, and we never know who knows she is a woman and who thinks she is a man. We have gender identity constructed entirely through clothing and personal decisions, NOT through birth. And we have, in the background, a very light version of the French Revolution which is clearly caused by the feminine vanity and frivolity if the queen, who is seen constantly primping and dreaming about love and spectacle. The queen is not looked on in a particularly negative light; on the contrary, her frills and finery are totally enchanting, as this is a little girl's world. In this film, everything is treated with a light touch, as light indeed as a comic book, so that there is a surface of pleasant aestheticism in the peasants, the court, and every frame which looks like a perfect picture.  There is a particularly unsatisfying storming of the Versailles, almost as if it was specifically geared towards the emotional pitch of little girls playing dress-up at a tea party, but all was done to preserve that flatness and lightness of a book of drawings made for girls. So actually this film is quite interesting, as it continues in Démy's habit of bringing perverse fairy tales to life in his own unique way. Démy was way ahead of his time, in going into issues of gender construction through clothing. The choices he made in the film were suitably peculiar, but above all they highlight these issues of a girl's fantasy life and her reluctance to grow up and have to take on an inferior or less fun role as a woman.
0307473708|5.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter is probably one of the most entertaining books I have read in a very long time.  The story itself is absolutely fascinating and the humor dark in a way that I just couldn't help but laugh, frequently, while reading.  I bought this book after watching Showtime's \\"Dexter\\" via NetFlix Instant Play, so I was already fairly familiar with about how the story would go, but there were definite and distinct differences between the plot of the book and the story arc of the first season of Dexter - which follows the book almost word for word in the first couple episodes.

0385504225|2.0|Wow, this book really mad me angry.  Not at the villan but at the author.  Dan Brown's work has really gone downhill.  There are so many unbelievable parts to the story and the last 1/3 of the book just went on and on.  I could hardly wait for it to end.<br /><br />The whole part about Langdon in the deprivation chamber is...how do I say this, TERRIBLE......ROTTEN.....STUPID.<br /><br />Save your money and borrow it from a friend.
0060987464|5.0|Many rock biographies have been written and there are some released each year. Why? Quite simply because the life of the people who write them or being written about are much more interesting than yours. How can I prove that? A good portion of those books are bestsellers and many more will be in the future. Marilyn Manson's biography \\"The Long Road Out Of Hell\\" is one the best of those. His book is honest indicative of how he became the person he is and what he went through. When some rock stars write how difficult their lives was it's sometimes \\"poor me, poor little rock star\\", not him, not Marilyn he couldn't care less if you felt bad for him and doesn't ask you to.<br />From his early days as a fan of bands like KISS, Judas Priest and Rush to the horror of seeing his grandfather masturbate as a kid to his intriguing meetings with Anton Lavey founder of the church of Satan, this book is captivating to matter horrifying it can be at times. It recalls how many of the kids mistreated him and played cruel pranks on him. He also talks about his first love and sexual experiences and latter in the book his relation with other girls. When he talks about his band mates or former ones he doesn't lie he's being honest and sometimes even apologizes. He says someone don't play right and how they aren't as great as they think and goes in depth about how those individuals were fired. He gives much insight into the relationship he had with them.<br /><br />It's a rock star biography alright as there is plenty of sex, drugs and rock `n'roll in it, if not it wouldn't be right? The backstage encounters with fans lead to very intimate situations and some hilarious ones. You see just how far a fan goes. It covers what you want to know and some things you wish you didn't knew. When he talks about Satanism, it is different from the kind of Satanism you might think it would be. His perception of it is that you do not believe in Satan you believe in yourself and how you are your own God. It does not have anything to do with worshiping Satan (well not to this kind of Satanism at least) and making sacrifices. That was very informative and educative as well seeing many people who believe he worships the devil.<br /><br />The book covers the debut of the Marilyn Manson and The Spooky Kids band as they released their first album, dropping the \\"...and the spooky kids\\" in the band name and most important of all the making of his \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" album the album that put him on the map. The book was released in 1998 so it tells basically the early years of the band, it the band's rise to fame .It's nice to see some of Manson's texts as he tries to get published in a magazine. I read them and while I'm not a fan of the genre of the stories he writes I thought there were good and he could well have done a career writing for those magazines. He writes some horror-comedy style stories. At the end of the book there is even a mini-journal of a tour with some events that happened, sometimes there are lots of descriptions and sometimes there are very little.<br /><br />As some might expect there is a lot of talk about Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, about how he helped Manson achieve success and get a record deal and even helped him writing song. But also how Manson wanted to step out of his shadow and how at their debut the Manson band were only appreciated by a some NIN fans. Manson has been known to shock people and is quite controversial, yes, but people often make a false idea of something and he talks about how often some people made false rumors about him. In fact he denies some of those rumours in the book. He also defines what makes someone gay, a drug abuser or a cheater in his opinion. There is also an interview included in the book. In fact you get it all, interview, pictures (pretty good ones by the way), texts written by Manson and tour journal which makes it a little different from some of the other biographies out there.<br /><br />It has been some time since Marilyn Manson first released The Long Road Out Of Hell, yet it's still as good, the value of it has not diminished since then. If there was a new edition in which Manson would continue writing where he left and would write about his career since I would definitely get it. I'm sure he would have some other entertaining stories to scare us or make us laugh. Neil Strauss helped co-write the book and I believe he did have some sort of impact on it. He also co-wrote \\"The Dirt\\" with Motley Crue (another best-seller may I add), another successful bio.TLROOH is one of the best biographies of the genre because it's well-written, interesting and it's different from a lot of the rock star bios. Even someone who's not a fan could still enjoy this book; it's that good. I would highly recommend reading it to any fan or to anyone who is curious; I've read it a couple times since I've got it and enjoy each time.st released The Long Road Out Of Hell, yet it's still as good, the value of it has not diminished since then.

B002GY9F9K|3.0|I caught every episode as they originally aired and I have to say that this show gets much better as it goes along. I never read the books, so I have noting to compare the material with. The stories, characters and weird fantasy names for every location seem to be direct rip offs of The Lord of the Rings. I know they are not, but it's just all a little too familiar. The acting is fairly good, with the beautiful Bridget Regan putting forth the best effort. Craig Horner as The Seeker grew on me and veteran actor, Bruce Spence, plays a good wizard. Now, expect painful dialogue and acting from the supporting cast at times, but it's all in good fun. The SFX are hit and miss as well, but that's to be expected in a show like this. The New Zealand locations are spectacular and a few of the episodes manage to be really good, especially when they add a little comedy into the mix. Worth the time of any fantasy fan, but don't think you are getting anything near the quality of what Peter Jackson and his team of wizards did for this genre.

096798467X|4.0|Have only recently received the book and completed a first reading.  The idea is great, and it appears to be relative easy to build.  Liked the idea and book layout so much, that I ordered a second book to gift to a friend who is also comtemplating building an oven.
0385504225|2.0|Two thirds of the way into the Lost Symbol- I was enjoying it... but then, it started to lose its way. It was almost as if Dan Brown got to that point in the story and was like \\"oh crap - now how can I end this???\\" .. to me, it was like he had all these great ideas leading up to a couple of mysterious revelations (what was on the laptop, what was the treasure) and bammo - didn't know what they were himself so came up with sub-par drivel instead--- lame ass shizz.    I'm thoroughly and utterly let down. I was enjoying it... and then, the sizzle died suddenly and - sigh, what absolute drivel.    He almost had it though. He needed another year or 2 on this.... take his time and come up with a better laptop revelation, a better mysteries revelation.... cut out the waterboarding, sigh, ... oh Dan, man, you let us down.....
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Dan Brown's \\"The Lost Symbol\\" was a highly disappointing book. The writing was not that great and it was highly repetitive. The CIA Director of Security came across as a total buffoon. It did not present anything new or revealing about the secretive Masons.    It was a big letdown from \\"The DaVinci Code.\\" Wait till you can find it in a used paperback bookstore and buy it for around $3.00.
0385504225|1.0|I slogged through this book over two days. It was tough going. Boring plot. Predictable secondary characters. Ridiculous antagonist. While The DaVinci Code was at least redeemed by a semblance of originality, The Lost Symbol was only symbolic of a mediocre writer working worn-out, warmed-over material. I regret the time wasted on this book--the writer's, the editor's and mine.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|[[ASIN:B000YCLRBA Tchaikovsky - Eugene Onegin / Fleming, Vargas, Hvorostovsky, Gergiev, Carsen [Metropolitan Opera 2007]]]  It is very nice to watch a DVD with beautiful scenery; but it is also true that you can get distracted, that is why even the scenography was very simple, I was more focused on the artist's performance, there singing, and acting,  and also the drama, for those reasons I enjoyed so much, the performance of all were super.  I brought Sir Georg Solti's' version a couple of years ago and the scenery was very beautiful, this is an \\"advance\\" when you make it as a movie, beside, the actors and singers were not the same. I took a while to decide to buy this version, and I am glad I bought this one, I like to see a DVD that the acting and singing were done by the same artists.  An other thing that I enjoyed were the lights , to put an example of the effect of these was the duel scene with the use of claroscuro that made so dramatic, as well as in other passages of the drama . The costumes were very beautiful and the sound wonderful.  This DVD was the first that I bought from the HD Metropolitan Performance series and of course I can see the difference in the images quality compared to other DVD.  This is an outstanding production.
0545128285|4.0|As I elluded to this is a mixed pot. The short stories are great for children, however a few are disturbing and could cause nightmares and the commentery is better for teenagers and grown ups. It is a great supplemental read to the Harry potter books.
B0002DB50E|5.0|Definitely a cult film and by far, one of the best Criterion releases (cover art, features, booklet, etc)    This movie is bizarre, gory, provocative, insane and surreal...Long Live David Cronenberg and Criterion Collection!
B0009V9286|5.0|Takes me back to Shakira's very 1st album Pies Descalzos. Since Shakira went english I kind of lost intrest. However, this album Fijaci&oacute;n Oral, Vol. 1 was a whole lot better.... I give this one a 5 star. Very very good and mellow out.
0061730327|5.0|The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind is one of the best books I've read in a while and it is one everyone appears to agree on across the board.  I strongly recommend this for summer reading lists, or even as a regular school year assignment.  Well written, logically laid out, and this book will change how you feel when you walk into a supermarket. Bryan Mealer (co-author) is extremely gifted, and at points I felt I was suffering along with William.<br /><br />The authors give us a front seat view of what it is like to eke out an existence as a Malawian farm family using brawn and wits, and trusting that the weather cooperates.  William Kamkwamba reminds me of my father, who, as a boy, also loved inventing, electricity, and built go-carts out of anything useful he could find.  My father also went through the lens of starvation, although in his case, it was in the aftermath of WWII.  He ended up as an electrical engineer, with his specialty being electrical power substations that boost power to remote areas.<br /><br />I am very encouraged by this story because as the author correctly points out, his success \\"...gave me even more confidence that we Africans can develop our continent if we just put our minds and abundant resources together and stop waiting on others to do it for us.\\" (pg. 346)  He is absolutely right...and this applies to everyone, regardless if they are in Malawi, Kenya, Ethiopia, or the US.  If you want to change your lot in life, educate yourself and do it.  Do not rely on someone to give you a hand-out; use your hands to build a better future.<br /><br />I have a strong feeling that this young man from Malawi is going to change the face of the African continent, and this is the one time I wish I could give a book 10 stars.  Bravo William, bravo!
0743270754|5.0|This is an absolutely spectacular book.  When I started, it was so long that I figured I'd read a chapter or two, then switch to a novel, then go back to it.  Wrong!  Once I started, I was hooked, and it only kept getting better.  Even things that I knew the story of, I still read as if it were a mystery novel with the plot still to be unveiled.  By the end, I was extremely emotional and felt I had a whole new appreciation for Lincoln and his greatness.  There is no doubt in my mind that he was our nation's greatest president.  If only we had him now!  Doris Kearns Goodwin brought humor, insight, and depth to what could have been a very dry subject.  This book is now in my 'top 10' reads of all time.
B0020TS5JM|5.0|Not sure why I only heard about this movie from browsing my local Blockbuster, but this is one blockbuster of a title. One that deserves the attention and recognition it deserves. At least rent it, but in my opinion, it deserves to be owned. A must see.
076531178X|5.0|As a very avid reader - I have been severely disabled for the past 13 years, and now considered to be terminal, I am constantly looking for new authors/series of books with books available for the Kindle (the only way I am able to read books any longer since I do not have the strength or motor skills to turn pages.) I was unaware of Sanderson until it was announced that he would be completing Robert Jordan's WHEEL OF TIME epic. Since I wanted to see if he was up to the monumental task, I picked up MISTBORN to introduce myself to his style of writing.    I was amazed at his skill in introducing and immersing the reader into the new world of The Final Empire. Great depth of character and visuals. I was immediately drawn into the story and intrigued by the sub story which was a \\"reprint\\" of a book found within the story. The mysterious writer of this section was revealed later into the story line, but I kept guessing as to who was the mystery writer of the journal. It opened up the history of the land and added a great deal to the intrigue of the entire book.    I have become captivated by the characters and the originality of the development of the plot. Too often authors will leave too much to the imagination of the reader, and you come away confused or unsatisfied with the story since you do not have a clear picture of the atmosphere, geography or attributes of the race. Sanderson fulfills all of these aspects with vivid visual descriptions. By incorporating the history of the Final Empire, the reader is rewarded with a complete background picture of the story. Very few authors are able to do this well - Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, Terry Brooks, Melanie Rawn. I wish I had discovered this wonderful author sooner - since my life expectancy is very short now - I may not get to read all of the other books in this series. And I sincerely regret that I will not be able to see how he concludes Robert Jordan's  WHEEL OF TIME series. I suspect that this author is one of the few who could be able to follow in Jordan's very big footsteps.
B00138J7ZC|5.0|I love this CD.  I usually come to Amazon to download my music, as it's cheeper than iTunes.  However, with this CD/MP3 Download, i noticed iTunes has it for the same price with an extra song.  In addition, the \\"Album Only\\" song here on Amazon is standard on iTunes and you can purchase it individually.  As the DRM is present on both, iTunes I think provides the better deal here.
B001RTP48G|5.0|The best album of this amazing duo.....you really  have to listen to this masterpiece.Here some of the best tracks...<br />Are you a romantic?<br />You will love.<br />-The Way It Used To Be<br />-Vulnerable<br />-King Of Rome<br />Do you like to dance songs with very smart and human lyrics.<br />- Love etc.<br />-  Did You See Me Coming?<br />- More Than A Dream<br />-Pandemonium<br />Really great songs about life, love and dreams....<br />The entire disc lets you listen to songs full of human situations told in a unique way in which feelings are expressed with true genius and innocence ( unbelievable, like when you first fell in love.)<br />While this duo uses all his wits to send a real and critical message, something that many musicians  are afraid to do.<br />The second disc is for dancing....the same great songs..<br />I REALLY LOVE THE SONG , More than a dream (Magical dub) .<br />Believe me, this is not another dance music record.
B00164KYV4|5.0|As a movie in absolute terms I'd give it 3 stars.  But I think it's a particularly great date movie - albeit not a traditional simple \\"will he win her\\" date movie.  There are endless twists and turns of the various relationships in the film, and the two of you can have fun with it.
B001GCUO16|5.0|Wow! 5 of 5 stars for this X-men movie! Great story, great characters, extremely well created movie! Action, sci-fi, characters, scenses, wow! OK, I am a fan of the X-men series of movies (1 to 3). Now this installment gives the history of the key character Wolverine, from young kid just discovering his mutant skills to his time at war (from WWI to Viet Nam). This is a must watch movie; oh, Blu-Ray makes a big difference!! This is now on my favorite movie list!
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|this is another great rise against album that does not dissapoint. i bought this one third, the latest album being first. My second album was Siren Song of the Counter Culture, and i loved it. the siren song album had more of a punk edge to it compared to the latest (Appeal to Reason). This album, though, was the perfect mix of the 2 other albums. there was traces of punk, alternative, and just rock throughout. I loved the mix of fast beats and the sence of melody in the album. a must get for any rise against fan.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I was laughing histerically the whole time i was watching this movie, then watched it over again!! The movie was great!! and everytime i watch it i get something more out of it! (mostly more laughs though!)  I would recomend this movie to the world!
1594201927|5.0|Concise. Insightful. Gripping. Engaging. Well written in the King's English. Unbiased. And relevant.     What more could you ask for in a non-fiction work pertaining to the most intimidating topic of all for most? I read Ferguson's Empire and was not nearly as taken. I reluctantly picked this up at a friend's suggestion and could not put it down. He breaks complex financial events into undstandable narrative. He also ties the histories of the past to the crisis of today, and looks to what we should learn, and what we have no control over, in the future. A work of genius.     Money well spent.... for the record I used cash. Bravo Prof. Ferguson, I look forward to more.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|I see many of you wrote about the missing videos of this compilation, and I agree. But some of the videos are just a NONSENSE request, some of them weren't even official videos or were just some mix of other videos. Live performances catalogued music videos DOESN'T count (like Dress You Up or Holiday Blond Ambition).    For me the, the true videos that were left from this compilation are:    - Everybody  - Gambler  - Oh Father  - Dear Jessie (Animated clip, no Madonna in it)  - This Used to be my playground  - Bad Girl  - Fever  - Love Don't Live Here Anymore  - You Must Love Me  - Don't Cry for Me Argentina (same footage of the Film)  - Drowned World  - Nothing Really Matters  - American Life (Original Version & Edited)    Oh Father was released in the Immaculate Collection DVD, so it's not \\"unreleased\\".  Bad Girl, Fever, Love Don't Live Here Anymore, Drowned World & Nothing really matters can be found in the Video Collection 93:99 DVD as well.    So truly, the only unreleased videos are everybody, gambler and American Life. This Used to be my playground & You Must Love Me were released in the Special Edition of their respective movies DVD's.    Ok, there are also other videos that I'd count even though they weren't promotional music videos for albums, but would count for the \\"complete\\" madonna collection: Bedtime Story (Re-Invention Version) & Paradise (Drowned World).     Also there are Get Together Original Version and Erotica X-Rated Edition but I wouldn't count them because if so, we would talk about this Extended Lucky Star video, Canadian version of Express Yourself and many other videos with slightly different cuts... Same goes for the GHV2 Megamix and that video of Hey You.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Without a doubt, Gandhi has to be one of the most momentous and poignant movies ever made. Based on a true story, this powerful 1982 depiction, directed and produced by Richard Attenborough, recaps the life of Mohandas K. Gandhi (1869-1948), who arguably becomes one of the most remarkable and influential human beings ever to walk the earth.      The movie begins as it similarly ends, with shots being fired and a quick glimpse at Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) as he is heard uttering the words \\"Oh God, Oh God...\\" For those not familiar with the story, be prepared to be pulled in immediately. A haunting tale to say the least, the story gives insight to what life was like in India during the harsh and violent rule of the British empire. Torture, oppression, and prejudice are inflicted upon the Indian people under the British guise of maintaining order.    As a young Indian lawyer, Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) begins his quest for world peace through what is termed non-violent resistance. His values of \\"peaceful, nonviolent, non-cooperation\\"  become legendary. He refuses to fight, but also refuses to give his obedience to tyranny, which leaves the British government perplexed and bewildered as how to best deal with him.. Though he suffers greatly at the hands of his tormentors, and  of his own free will, Gandhi holds firm to his beliefs and spreads a message of love and peace to everyone who will listen. In his words, \\"The way of truth and love always wins.\\"     The movie has strong ties to Hinduism and gives an inside glimpse at life as a Hindu. One of its philosophical beliefs becomes a main theme throughout the movie, \\"the way to God is to free yourself of possessions and passions.\\" Through distancing himself from worldly pleasures and practicing meditation, prayer, and fasting, Gandhi  remains steadfast and true to his beliefs. His infinite wisdom and divine strength serve to educate, persuade, and unite.     Beautifully written by John Briley, Ben Kingsley delivers the performanceof a lifetime. Every adult, young and old, should be required to see this inspiring story of love and courage and by action, the very definition of greatness. This one will be a classic for all times!        IMDb. Gandhi (1982). 19 Sept. 2009. <[...]>    Kingsley, Ben. Gandhi. 1982. 18 Sept. 2009. <[...]>

0307266303|5.0|Born to run is an excellent work.  Saw the author on The Daily Show, which prompted my purchase.  If you like stories about indians, extreme sports, sports medicine/training, underdogs, nature or running you'll enjoynthis book.  If your not a big fan of any of the above, but just enjoy a good story, you'll enjoy this book.  Run don't walk to your favorite store/site and buy this book.
B000XTLUW0|1.0|Wow, have concert videos sunk to such new lows that every editor takes crack before editing?<br /><br />This is literally the third concert video this year I've bought, and the third one is the worst for having crappy crack-addled editing. I literally couldn't get even halfway into \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" without getting a headache. I don't care how much I love Muse, I HATE crappy editing.<br /><br />Seriously, You hardly get to see the band for longer than a second because of how choppy the editing is. The only time it calms down is during \\"Take a Bow\\", the last song. We get it, the audience is freaking wild, stop showing us 500 shots of the crowd every song (Maiden do this sometimes but only maybe 4 or 5 times per song). Yeah, you like to shake the camera a lot, stop shaking the goddamn camera, it gives me a freaking headache. The credits credit a \\"Steadicam operator\\". As the 2 star reviewer says, obviously his shots didn't make it to the final cut or otherwise it would be a lot clearer.<br /><br />In short, I will not be buying the next Muse live video if it ends up like HAARP. While the CD is great, the DVD was just painful to watch.
0393307050|2.0|After reading a lot of the reviews, I was all charged up for an exciting tale of seafaring at the turn of the 18th century.  What a disappointment!  I have to admit I only read about 125 pages of this yawner, but I simply couldn't take any more.    First, absolutely nothing exciting happened.  Captain Aubrey received his first command, met Dr. Maturin, went out looking for sailors, and then took his new ship out on a shake-down cruise.  Something went wrong on this sail but I wasn't able to figure it out what it was because the book contains a bunch of sailing terminology that went straight over my head.  I suppose I could have done some research and become conversant with 18th century sailing terminology, but that's not why I read fiction.  I want to be entertained, not confused.    In addition, Mr. O'Brian writes in a very awkward style of prose.  As some have said, I guess you will get used to it, but I prefer a more straightforward kind of writing. If O'Brian had written this novel in 1800, I could understand it.  But all the books in this series were written in the last 40 years so I just don't get it.  I guess he was trying to write like somebody 200 years old and thought that was cool.      If you're looking to read all 20 of these books I guess the research needed to understand the sailing terms might be worthwhile.  But if you're just looking to read exciting tales from the age of fighting sail, there are better options out there.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This movie is, with a doubt, the best vampire film I have ever seen. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Also for those of you worried about receiving a version with the bad subtitles I would like to let you know that the version I received came with the theatrical subtitles.
B00080Z53O|5.0|I watched this movie for the second time. It's been in my collection for over a year now and I finally got a buddy to watch it with me. He was apprehensive to watch this movie because of the sensitive subject matter. I sort of tricked him into watching it tonight and he loved it. I'm so glad to have rediscovered this film already in my collection.    I could relate to some degree with what it's like to live with someone who is disabled as my father suffered from Muscular Dystrophy. MD is a degenerative disease which tragically people succumb to after a arduously long degenerative battle. This story will hit a nerve for the loved ones who have or have had family members affected with a degenerative disease.     I thought the movie was exceptionally well done. A story well told which managed to extract a few tears here and there from me. This is a story poetically directed and expressed about the elegiac life changing misfortune that Sampedro endured.
B001MVYUPC|4.0|The movie that had so much in how the life of one can change the lives of so many. It was one of the best movies that showed human to human interaction. That forced change in a time that outside forces did not want to take place. The true nature of the human being was turned inside out, with colonial control and the caste system that would cloud the vision of so many people, who could not see the bigger picture when it came to freedom and they chose to be free in one's own home land. The acting was very well done the settings where some of the best parts of the film the number of people that it had to take to pull some of the scenes off had to be a Hugh task. Let us look at how the plot of the film came in to being. The main creator Gandhi was a lawyer for the people, a people who had their lives controlled by the then British Empire. The journey of Ben Kinsley(Gandhi) the main creator in the film was to unite the people of India so that one, they could have their independent from the nation of Britain and to help with the internal  conflict  of the people of India that had been on a down trend for years. The one aspect that has a strong relation to the Hindu belief system is that of caste system this   was a belief that all people had their duties or place in the Hindu belief system. Some people where to have a higher place then others this is what put the task of independents in a head on collision with that of the new India that Ben Kinsley's creator was trying to help. This was a very moving film that had a fear reaching incite to humanity as a hold.
B002GZQYMA|5.0|Do you hear that? It's the collective of Muse fans crying after yet another album of Muse's gets released. Well I'm so sorry for them. They wasted their money. Boo hoo hoo, it's all Muse's fault for progressing and taking a step forward in their career. Waaaah.<br /><br />Anyways this is Muse's fourth album and is their best since Origin of Symmetry. The band does not disappoint here, and yes it is different, however in a good way.<br /><br />There's a lot of good songs to be heard on here- THe catchy opener \\"Uprising\\" has some of Bellamy's best vocals ever, period. Undisclosed Desires is brilliant, a way different Muse song, and deifinitely a great different track for the British art rock trio. Guiding Light is a very Queen-esque song that I LOVE! It definitely has a very \\"A Night at the Opera\\" sound to it. Unnatural Selection is one helluva catchy song, one that is definitely a must-play-over-and-over type track. I Belong To You is a very catchy, White Albumesque track that may take a little getting used to, but I love it. The last three tracks, however, are the best: The Symphony tracks are one epic experience when listened to together.<br /><br />Anyways, the special edition of the album comes with a DVD that has a 45 minute documentary on the making of the album. It's quite fun to watch, as it has a lot of moments of the band goofing off. And it's done in chronological order, so therefore it's in the order of the songs. That said, the only thing I don't like is the menu seriously thinks it's a video game.<br /><br />Anyways, this is a great album, do NOT side with the negative reviewers before listening to it. Just listen to it yourself and judge. I can't wait to see them live on this tour now!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|The Breakfast Club is likely the most famous high school movie ever made, and it's certainly one of the most loved films of the 1980s. Released in 1985 during the height of the \\"Brat Pack,\\" it features fantastic performances from Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, and Emilio Estevez. These five actors depict teen stereotypes and manage to make each character sympathetic and likable. It's a testament to the genius of John Hughes that such a simple but unlikely plot line induces a powerful emotional reaction from so many viewers. And while the film is a bit implausible and certainly a product of its era, its underlying themes remain as realistic and pertinent as ever. This is the height of John Hughes' teen movies and is not to be missed by any generation. 5 Stars.    The Flashback Edition includes several enjoyable and informative bonus features and a relatively high quality picture.
B001QOOCTE|4.0|Caught the original broadcast on PBS and I was awed. This set (cd/dvd) captures the music and the spirit of the original broadcast. The dvd production is limited but when one considers the price - under $10! - it is a real bargain.     To be honest, until I saw/heard this program, I really didn't fully understand the impact that Michael Jackson had on the world - cultural as well as musical. This program helped me to understand how music unites us. It was one of those unintended consequences?    A better deal cannot be found.
B002GZQYMK|2.0|Muse has never been as important as they think they are. However, they are able to write some decent songs every once in a while. Their latest album, The Resistance, is marred by some horrible production values. The album starts off with the great song, \\"The Uprising,\\" but just goes down hill from there. Many of the songs on the album might have been ok if it wasn't for the sloppy production found on a majority of the songs. Perhaps they should have taken more time in the studio. Whatever the reason, this album is definitely sub-par.
B001JV5BIA|5.0|its a GREAT well acted movie but it gets a bit disturbing with the sexual assult, and almost glorifies violence but the killers get what they deserved and the movie really has some good suspense and a feel good tone when u see each bad guy get their moment.<br /><br />overall the lines are good, this is the best in it's class and wes craven is good at making these movies and i saw previews and HAD TO SEE IT its great
B002GZQY6Q|1.0|Ok, I understand that bands grow/evolve/change etc over their career. In the case of Porcupine Tree I believe they've hit a patch of growing pains along the way. I realize this band is really Steven Wilson's baby but things have been very gradually going astray since Chris Maitland's departure. After hearing Time Flies a few weeks before the release of The Incident I was very excited. It sounded like it could have been some long lost track from the Lightbulb Sun era (Or perhaps borrowed right from Pink Floyds \\"Dogs\\"?) Ah, a return to form after Fear Of A Blank Planet. Nope, not the case. The Incident is a meandering mess of what seems to be half [...] musical ideas stitched together that SW has tried to deliver as one cohesive piece. I keep listening, giving it a chance, waiting for something to happen, thinking I missed something. But no. Its just not there and honestly, it all comes off a bit pretentious. I'm not saying the ideas and musicianship isn't good, but it certainly isn't up to snuff when compared to what they've done before. I guess the worst offense is that for the most part its just plain boring! The lush harmonies, haunting guitar work, and emotional, sometimes nearly heart wrenching delivery has been replaced by what sounds like an entire band who've taken too much Paroxetine. SW has his hands in a lot of projects. If he's going to continue with Porcupine Tree then he needs to make records that actually sound like and live up to Porcupine Tree's legacy. Leave this sort of material and concepts for either solo work or other projects. For the record, I've been listening to Porcupine Tree since Sky Moves Sideways. Got to see them when they were practically unknown and the opener for other bands. Its been wonderful witnessing they're rise. I wish them the best but this time around isn't for me. PS: Why do parts of Bonnie The Cat sound like the Knight Rider theme song??? WTF is going on here? :::Bracing for the bashing by the fanboys:::
B001GM28HO|4.0|I'm not a fan of the latest Pop music, or anything else currently being played on the radio or MTV.  I'm not typically into music about going out to the club and dancing and partying all night.  I hated the song \\"Just Dance\\" so I assumed I didn't like Lady Gaga, but after hearing \\"Poker Face\\" and \\"Love Game\\", my interest grew.  I bought this cd the other day and I just love it.  It's very rare that I like more than a couple tracks on an album but on this one I like most.  If you think you may possibly be somewhat interested in Lady Gaga, give this album a chance and she may become your new favorite.  My favorite songs on the cd are not even singles, yet.  There are so many single worthy songs on this album.  My favs are \\"Money Honey\\", \\"The Fame\\", and \\"I like it Rough\\".  What I think has been missing from Pop music for years is a good addictive hook in the chorus, one that you want to play over and over, and that is where Lady Gaga shines.  I can't get enough of \\"Money Honey\\"!  My only complaint is the songs are a little short.  They follow the same format as you would expect; intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, chorus, fade out... but most of them are just over 3 minutes.  Can't wait to see what she's got for us next... I WANT MORE!!!
0385341008|4.0|I loved the way this book caught my attention since the first day...transporting me, making me feel part of the reading society.<br />Such a beautiful author and story teller...a true inspiration for young authors like me.<br /><br />This is a keeper....

1572814748|5.0|The Universal Waite deck is my favorite of all the flavors of Rider-Waite Tarot Decks on the market. The original drawings have been re-colored by Mary Hanson-Roberts and they are beautiful to look at as well as inspiring to use for readings.<br /><br />This deck is smaller than a normal tarot deck but not as small as mini tarot card decks.  They measure ~3.5\\" x 2.25\\" in size.  They come in a heavy duty box with a lift off lid.  It measures ~3.5\\" x 2.75\\" x 1.5\\" in size.  The top comes off without much effort, so I keep the deck in a travel case that is used for soap.<br /><br />My only issue with this deck is that the language in the LWB is somewhat archaic, flowery and hard to follow at times.  It reminds me of Victorian English using terms like hoodwinked for blindfolded.  It is not really a problem since this deck is easy to read without any help.<br /><br />One more thing I was happy with about my deck is that the drawings are very fine with more detail visible on this deck than on my Albino-Waite deck which uses the same line work; and this deck is smaller.<br /><br />This deck I would recommend if you want a deck of tarot cards to travel with or carry with you. I am very glad I bought this deck.
B002ISTQSE|2.0|Product was advertised as digitally remastered. However, upon viewing the DVD was almost completely defective. Plenty of freeze frames, jumps and scrambling.  Very poor quality...must be a \\"knockoff\\" from China!!  Needless to say, this DVD will be returned. Pass on this one!!
B00127RAJY|3.0|The dvd is set up so that I have to watch their commercials before starting the program EVERY TIME.  So much for 20 minutes.   This is bogus.
B001TOD92C|2.0|After all the Oscar buzz about this movie, I expected more. I had difficulty determining what the plot was supposed to be, and it just kind of meandered its way to the end. I supposed wrestling fans may get a charge out of it, but it was pretty blah to me.
B001N26GFM|2.0|There are two good things about this film. One is the marvellous performances of its two young leads. The other is the reminder that the top Nazis were often loving and devoted parents, yet they committed some of the vilest atrocities in history. We tend to demonise the Nazis, but the fact is that these monstrous deeds were not committed by aliens from another planet but by people from one of Europe's most civilised countries. Fanaticism of any kind, religious, political, racial, is a terrible thing.<br /><br />However, for me, these are not enough to save the film, which, even to my inexpert eyes, seems ridiculously contrived.<br /><br />Kids in Nazi Germany were indoctrinated from an early age. A kid such as Bruno, son of a senior officer in the Totenkopf SS, would have received an especially big dose of teaching against the evils of pernicious Jewry. Such a child would have run a mile rather than come anywhere near a Jew, never mind actually befriend one. On the other hand, Jewish kids in what appears to be a \\"Vernichtungslager\\" (extermination camp) had a minute life expectancy - as useless mouths incapable of working usefully in the work camps associated with the Vernichtungslager, they usually went straight from the train into THAT queue. To find a feeble bit of non-electrified fence with no guard towers just out the back of the commandant's house and for a Jewish kid to find a job that apparently consists of pushing around an empty wheelbarrow, well, it's all too absurd. Not to mention that Shmuel is apparently a German Jew, so Bruno and he have a common language. All the Vernichtungslager were in Poland, and took Jews from all over occupied Europe. How lucky can you be?<br /><br />The only thing missing from this fairy tale is a happily-ever-after ending.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|John Wayne and James Stewart made a very interesting pairing in films. Their last appearance was in \\"The Shootist.\\" James Stewart was a World War II hero in the real sense. John Wayne, despite all of his war movies, was not a veteran. Likewise Lee Marvin was also a military veteran.<br /><br />In this movie John Ford did to westerns what Alfred Hitchcock did to horror. The audience is not simply spoon-fed a typical movie with a simple plot. At the end of the show, there are many points to contemplate. Too bad it was not produced in color.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|Revolver originally came out in 1966, and on cd in 1987.  This album's songs are essential to anyone who calls themselves Beatles Fans.  To just about anyone else it is still an incredible album.  My favorite songs from here are Taxman, She Said She Said, For No One, Good Day Sunshine, Tomorrow Never Knows (love that Tibetan Book of the Dead thing).    As far as the remaster goes, there is great improvement sonically.  The bass seems deeper, drums are more forward and the guitars have more bite.  This definately is a sonic improvement over the old 87 remaster.  5 stars.  Recommended.
0385504225|5.0|Secret societies have always intrigued me and Dan Brown's coverage of the Masons fulfilled my appetite to understand this highly secretive organization.  Brown weaves in just the right amount of fact and fiction to keep the pages turning. I found myself \\"Googling\\" terms, phrases and organizations mentioned in the book - only to find out that they are all true. I lived in the DC area for 37 years and I thought I understood the city but I will now see it in a new light.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Great record. Great production with killer solos and riffs. This is Megadeth at its finest. Finally a Megadeth album that I can listen to without skipping any songs. Dave Mustaine has done it again and doesn't disappoint.
0385340990|5.0|This was undoubtedly one of the best books i have read this year. Borrowing unashamedly from Hanff's 84 Charing Cross Road the novel creates in letter form a tableau of  life in the Channel Islands during World War II. To my mind it never strikes a wrong note. There is humour , tragedy and romance. I would recommend it without hesitation.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|Many of you are \\"of a certain age\\" and grew up with The Beatles.  I was in elementary school when the British Invasion of pop/rock music started.  It stayed with me throughout my childhood.    I confess to never being a huge Beatles fan.  I was more into the Rolling Stones and Hendrix.  But I always appreciated the groundbreaking work of the Beatles as each new album expanded the horizons of rock music.    Recently the entire Beatles catalog was released on remastered CD's, individually and in both stereo and mono boxed sets.  Since the Beatles music is not available digitally (at least not through legitimate channels), I made an exception to my rule of buying only vinyl LP's or digital downloads and ordered two of the remastered CD's.  I started with the White Album and Past Masters (a collection on non-album tracks, most of which were big hits).  My order from Amazon arrived on Thursday.  I have been listening non-stop since then.    John Lennon was always my favorite Beatle.  I felt he was 80% of the Lennon/McCartney songwriting team, which in turn was at least 80% of the Beatles.  But the clarity of the reissued CD's brings out Paul McCartney's bass lines in a way not previously possible.  His work is skilled, melodic, and imaginative.  As a bass player myself, I can truly appreciate how much McCartney's bass lines contributed to the overall impact of this music.  I am not a fan of McCartney's post-Beatles work, but his contributions to these albums alone are enough to make him one of the great bassists in rock history.    If you are a music fan, or if the Beatles were a large part of the soundtrack of your childhood, these reissued CD's are highly recommended.  I've been carrying mine with me as I move from my audio system to my computer to my car.  I truly can't stop listening.  Yesterday I stopped at Best Buy and bought the Rubber Soul reissue.  It has the same magic.  Now I wonder if I should have spent the close to $200 to buy the entire box set.    P.S.  My 19 year old son and my 15 year old grandson, when not at their respective college and high school, have been playing the new Beatles Rock Band game on my son's Xbox 360.  They love the music, which is from the CD reissues and sounds great too.  Both insist that it is by far the best Rock Band game yet.  We may be seeing the creation of a new generation of Beatles fans.
B002P1YEY0|4.0|I couldn't put THE LOST SYMBOL down until I had finished it.     At the same time, I was not as engaged by this story as I had been with author Dan Brown's previous books. I found the plot a bit implausible, a bit too intricate, with all its many twists. One aspect in particular I won't mention, so as not to be a spoiler.    Still, nobody does this type of of techno-thriller better than Brown does, even if the techno part here does bog down at points. In no way does this discredit the width and the depth of Brown's research. His detail is enormous, past the point of counting all of the new bytes of information he shares with his readers.    As always with Dan Brown, there's much that will be pondered long after the book has been completed, especially the startling new information about Noetic Science.    I found THE LOST SYMBOL a tough read, albeit a worthwhile one, and I am glad that I finished it.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|This album is a proven fact that Muse is a band that wants to constantly evolve and mature their sound as musicians, and with The Resistance, they have accomplished just that. The albums stars with Uprising which is the catching more easy to listen song on the album. When I first listed to it, I was instantly craving for more of Muse's new music. This album does not disappoint, the production is top notch, this time with no producer, they had that freedom to create their music like they really want it, and the result is something that takes you off your feet and doesn't let you down until the last second of the last track is played. This is Muse's \\"A Night at the Opera\\".

B0016BWACI|4.0|[[ASIN:B0016BWACI The Dark Crystal [Blu-ray]]]    Review from: [...]    The first time I laid eyes on the film The Dark Crystal ,I was five years old. My Aunt took me to see it in the theater. It probably was one of the first films I saw in a theater. To make a long story short, I remember being bored with the film. That was the last time I saw it, until I got the Blu-ray Disc in the mail. Now, twenty-seven years later, here I sit in my living room watching it with my two and a half year old daughter. She walked away after the opening credits, but I was drawn in by how wonderful the disc looked and how great the story was.       The Dark Crystal is a film about the cycle of life and Good vs. Evil and their connection to each other. In a dark place, a dying race of birdlike creatures called Skeksis are in power and are the keepers of the Dark Crystal which holds the key to the life of the planet on which they all live.  In a not-too-far village lives a race known as the Mystics. They, too, are a dying race, but they have raised a young Gelfling boy named Jen.  Jen is the only known member of his race left, as the Skeksis have killed all of his kind off. However, there is a prophecy that a Gelfing boy will find the crystal shard that has broken from the dark crystal and  bring order back to the planet. Jen soon learns that he is that person and, with the help of a female, Gelfing named Kira,  Jen will try against all odds to fulfill the prophecy and bring order to the planet.        I never realized just how much The Dark Crystal really bought the world of puppets in film to life. Looking at the creatures in this film and the world in which they live, everything seems real even though it is fantasy. This film was the late Jim Henson's version of Lord of the Rings. It has a lot of detail and all the characters and creatures have their own unique personalities. The story and time in which it takes place is rooted with such deep historic overtones that you know that thestory has a lot of history to it. The story is perfectly written, with the prefect balance of story and characters.        The Dark Crystal is a film that was made with puppets in the lead roles, yet the effects look so good, one can almost believe that they are real beings. The universe in which the story takes place is full of so much life and detail. Every effect and set piece was made to really drag your mind into a world that looks and feel real. The effects in this film are so great for its time that it's one of those films that you know paved the way for other films that involved puppets and animatronics.     The Blu-ray disc is filled with special features. There are original special features that are part of the DVD which include Commentary with Brian Froud, The World of The Dark Crystal Documentary, Reflections of The Dark Crystal: \\"Light on the Path of Creation\\" & \\"Shard of Illusion\\", Test Scenes of the original Skeeksis Language and Deleted scenes.  The All New Blu-ray features include The Book of Thra -Dark Crystal Collector, SkekTek's Crystal Challenge - Trivia Game, Picture in Picture Storyboard Track and introduction by screenwriter David Odell on the original Skeksis Language.      Overall, The Dark Crystal is a great fantasy film.  The Blu-ray disc is not only packed with great features that tell you everything you need to know about the film, but the quality of sound and picture are top notch. Sony really did a great job putting this disc together as well as transferring the film to digital. The film really looks great in the Blu-ray format. If you were a fan of the film when it came out in 1982 or you discovered it as a grown-up on VHS or DVD; the Blu-ray disc is well worth the buy.
0385342020|5.0|I loved this book! It was just plain fun! I do not think anyone should try to take it seriously. It is Chick Lit after all. It makes you think about what life was like for your grandmothers and great-aunts. They were once young too. I liked the chemistry between the main characters. I laughed out loud at Sadie's \\"date\\". I finished this book quickly. It is plain fun. Read it if you want to just read something for the fun of it.
0385504225|4.0|I suspended my disbelief, got caught up in the ridiculous journey, and thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  My only caveat is that Brown's treatment of Christianity, which I do know something about, is so superficial and addlepated that I have to wonder if his treatment is similar when it comes to the Masons, noetic science, and other obscure topics.  I'm guessing yeah -- but then if I want to know more about those things, I am not going to read a work of escapist fiction written by a master magician of the art of spinning a tale using so many of the elements I've loved since childhood -- hidden codes and symbols, treasure maps, good versus evil, danger looming and escaped, twists, turns, and surprises, and a testing of the hero's mettle where he or she triumphs in the end.  Get your hoodwink on and take the ride.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Just to correct a previous reviewer - Till There Was You was not a Beatles composition - it is of course from the legendary Broadway show, and 1962 movie, 'The Music Man', written by Meredith Willson, and originally sung by Robert Preston.  I am delighted with the Mono remasterings, and fortunately still have my near-mint vinyl LPs....let's hope EMI decide to release individual mono CDs to meet the unexpected demand, to avoid the rather hefty price for the box set.
087349976X|5.0|What I particularly appreciate about this book is that it tells you how much wire you are going to need to make each component.  I watched videos on the internet (which are invaluable) but they say \\"Cut a length of wire......\\"   In contrast, when you are going to make a wrapped loop this book instructs, \\" Cut wire the length of the bead plus 2\\" or If you are making a simple loop with 18 gauge wire, measure the lenght of the bead plus 1\\" or for 20 gauge wire cut the lenght of the bead plus 3/4.\\"  No waste and no annoying wire hanging in your way.  Instructions are complimented by excellent step by step drawings which are big enough to see as are the excellent photos which accompany them.  I LOVE this book!!! The book is peppered with helpful hints, highlighted so you can find them again.     I have many many wonderful wire books but this is my favorite.  I am a beginner and jewelry made with the help of this book is gorgeous.  And there are many many more INTERESTING projects to go.
B002NXPTDK|5.0|If you are looking for traditional hip-hop or traditional anything than this album is not for you.  If you are looking for something different than this album has it.<br /><br />Somehow this album flows.  I hear a lot of people talking down Cudi's voice, but I think it works perfectly for what he's trying to do.  It's more of a spoken voice, but that's the aim of it.  Listen to Up, Up, Up , The pursuit of happiness, Day n Nite and Cudi Zone.  Each will catch you.  I actually like Cudi's voice on the album.  It's different.<br /><br />I'm a fan of all types of music.  Alternative, Hip-hop, Heavy Metal, Classical and Classic Rock. But I'm always looking for an album or artist that changes the game.  This does just that.  It fuses a lot of different things together, and than adds a touch of new.  I love it.<br /><br />I've never heard of Kid Cudi before this Album hit Amazon for $3.99, and now I'm hooked.  I feel like this album is an instant classic in my book.  And it will be interesting to see if it stands the test of time for my listening standards.
B002BIULQ2|3.0|My kids loved this movie, and it actually held my attention as well! No vulgarities, no nudity, no suggestive scenes. It was nice to watch a movie with my kids and not have to cover their eyes or turn off the movie halfway through.
0792164903|4.0|I used to love Tim Burton. Being a sf/fantasy/comics freak from childhood on, Burton was one of the few Hollywood filmmakers separate from the Lucas/Spielberg axis who was making stuff that I could always count on seeing with my non-film buff friends who were into the same sort of genre stuff I was. I loved \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", \\"Beetlejuice\\", and \\"Ed Wood\\", and always looked forward to what came next.<br /><br />But in the past decade or so he's disappointed more often than not. His \\"Planet of the Apes\\" remake was complete dreck, and \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", while not terrible, didn't seem necessary or particularly necessary either. \\"Sweeney Todd\\" was a little bit better, but still didn't make me particularly worry about having missed a couple of his more recent works. I caught up to one of those recently though, and I'm happy to say that my fears were not (mostly) justified.<br /><br />\\"Sleepy Hollow\\", first of all, has very little to do with the Washington Irving story which it is \\"based on\\" according to the credits. \\"Inspired by\\" might be more accurate, and the film takes equal inspiration from the works of Edgar Allan Poe (specifically his prototypical detective character, Dupin) and Hammer horror films from the late 50s and early 60s - going so far as to cast Christopher Lee in a small role at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />The cast is certainly a big, big part of the fun here, with such wonderful character veterans as Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough, Martin Landau and Christopher Walken all getting juicy (if generally small) turns in this story of a New York police constable, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), with \\"advanced\\" ideas being sent (more or less as punishment) to the small Hudson valley town of Sleepy Hollow to deal with a series of gruesome beheadings, in 1799. As the film develops, Ichabod believes there's a perfectly rational explanation for the murders, and it's to the film's credit and Depp's that as he gradually learns that in fact there is a fantastic, mystical presence behind them (Christopher Walken as the silent but deadly Headless Horseman), he continues to probe the secrets, never entirely giving up his rational belief system but also finding the ability to accept some of the religious/magical possibilities behind the horseman - while also coming under the spell of a young woman at the center of the horror (Christina Ricci).<br /><br />It's all quite beautifully shot, excellently acted with perhaps the exception of Ricci (one of those actors I can never really accept in period roles), who isn't really bad, and it's a wonderful mixture of comedy, scares and thrills, and a bit of the mystic. My only real problem with it comes in the ending, which is too much like a Scooby Doo \\"aha, I've got you now\\" episode; most of the film managed to keep me guessing at least a little bit but the finale is all too typical. Oh well; this is certainly one of the most pleasant surprises I've had in a while, and there's even some interesting stuff below the surface - the whole colonial/witch-haunted/Protestant New England of the 17th-18th centuries brushing up against the coming of modern science and the Industrial Revolution and secularism is quite expertly handled, though it never gets in the way of a good old-fashioned story. Really, loads and loads of fun and probably my 2nd-favorite Burton film at the moment after \\"Ed Wood\\".<br /><br />The DVD transfer seems quite excellent; I haven't listened to the commentary yet (I often don't) and the other extras are of middling interest.that in fact there is a fantastic, mystical presence behind them (Christopher Walken as the silent but deadly Headless Horseman), he continues to probe the secrets, never entirely giving up his rational belief system but also finding the ability to accept some of the religious/magical possibilities behind the horseman - while also coming under the spell of a young woman at the center of the horror (Christina Ricci).

B000025H0Q|5.0|People love to talk about their proverbial perfect desert-island albums. Quality-wise, Nick Drake's \\"Bryter Later\\" could easily be on my list, but that description doesn't sound quite right.<br /><br />I imagine desert islands as being dry and bright and isolated places; this album's much more suitable for rainy afternoons holed up in the condo. \\"Stay indoors beneath the floors, talk with neighbors only; the games you play make people say you're either weird or lonely,\\" Drake sings on \\"At the Chime of a City Clock.\\" The music, too, amplifies the urban cabin fever vibe; the arrangements are jazzy but melancholy, with a wonderful blend of wise guitar and playful piano and sad strings and resigned horns. (The horns are crucial; they help make \\"Bryter Later\\" that rarest of things--an excellent album that doesn't quite sound like anything that came before.) Drake's voice, soothing and hushed and cool, complements the songs perfectly, but there are great instrumental pieces, too, bisecting and bookending the album.<br /><br />\\"Five Leaves Left\\" was my first--and first favorite--Nick Drake album, but now I find myself listening to this one far more frequently. There's still plenty of melancholy here; on Hazey Jane I, for instance, Drake asks: \\"Do you like what you're doing? Would you do it some more? Only to stop once and wonder what you're doing it for?\\" But all in all, the relentless depression's been tempered quite a bit. That album's vibe is I-want-to-kill-myself-because-life's-pointless-and-I-won't-be-noticed-otherwise; this is more like I-don't-quite-feel-like-going-to-the-grocery-store-today.<br /><br />And that resignation's leavened, too, with a cautious optimism--today may be shot, but tomorrow's at least worth sticking around for. \\"Please give me a second grace; please give me a second face,\\" Drake sings on \\"Fly.\\" And then on \\"Northern Sky,\\" he asks: \\"Would you love me for my money? Would you love me for my mind? Would you love me through the winter? Would you love me until I die? If you would and you could, then come blow your horn for me.\\" It's a lovely song, but the pronouns alone are significant; on both this and \\"Five Leaves Left\\" there are times when the \\"you\\" refers to Drake himself, and the songs become mere mirrors, places for tortured artistic sensitivity and introspection, but on this, there are far more moments where the \\"you\\" is someone else. So Drake is at least spending less time gazing into mirrors and more time looking out windows, looking out from the darkened apartment at the faces in the city, searching for a connection with someone who can end the isolation.ou would and you could, then come blow your horn for me.\\" It's a lovely song, but the pronouns alone are significant; on both this and \\"Five Leaves Left\\" there are times when the \\"you\\" refers to Drake himself, and the songs become mere mirrors, places for tortured artistic sensitivity and introspection, but on this, there are far more moments where the \\"you\\" is someone else.

B000QXCOQE|4.0|You can read about how wonderful this book is from everybody else, and I'm not discounting the book at all from what they said, but if you're Christian and courting your future-spouse, this book probably won't be too helpful.  I'm not going to get into any religious debates, but I believe any serious Christian would court before marriage and that includes little to no physical contact before marriage.  One of the most important things in this book is the quiz at the back with a bunch of questions that let you choose one method of affection over another.  If you have never experienced physical affection, it is difficult to answer these questions and you'll find you can't accurately determine your love language(s).     Good book if you're married, not so good if you're courting.
0064410935|5.0|I expect that most people who read this will know what happens at the end of the book, but in case you don't, I shall keep quiet. This last section marks the book out as a bit more mature than many children's books, dealing with concepts that some children can't handle until they get older. That aside, this is a wonderfully written children's story, taking place primarily in a farm yard and barn, telling of the characters with whom Wilbur, a pig, shares his home. The animals are all written so well, they seem like real people, and coupled with Garth Williams's excellent illustrations make for an enjoyable read for the 8-15 age bracket.<br /><br />This story was recently turned into a film, and the book isn't that different from the film, however it does give nuances that only the printed page can bring, so is well worth reading even if you already know the story.<br /><br />The story is so well-written it has won awards, and this small sample of prose shows just how good E.B. White is: \\"The Autumn days will shorten and grow cold. The leaves will shake loose from the trees and fall. Christmas will come, then the snows of winter. You will live to enjoy the beauty of the frozen world\\". It's just a beautiful piece of writing, showing that you don't have to talk down to children for them to enjoy books.

B0020MKTOS|5.0|I purchased a copy of GRAN TORINO used from Amazon.com.  I used to be a little hesitant in the past but have had only positive experiences.  This purchase was no exception!  Not only was the DVD in perfect condition but the movie was great.  Clint Eastwood is a spectacular actor!  I was surprised at how little actual violence was in the movie - although the language was raw.  This is an all-around A+.
0374531269|5.0|I had to google the author to see if there were more memoirs from him. His story moved me to do a research on African child soldiers.<br /><br />This paragraph from page 106 is just powerful<br /><br />In the forest are men waiting to destroy all our lives. We have fought them as best as we can, but there are too many of them. They are all around the village.\\" The lieutenant made a circle in the air with his hands. \\"They will not give up until they capture this village. They want our food and ammunition.\\" He paused, and slowly continued: \\"That is why we need strong men and boys to help us fight these guys, so that we can keep this village safe. If you do not want to fight or help, that is fine. But you will not have rations and will not stay in this village. You are free to leave, because we only want people here who can help, cook, prepare ammunition, and fight. There are enough women to run the kitchen, so we need the help of able boys and men to fight these rebels. This is your time to revenge the deaths of your families and to make sure more children do not lose their families.
B0026RHR6K|4.0|If you're trying to decide whether to buy the complete set, you probably already know the show is briliant. (Although the last season was somewhat lacking.) If you don't own any of the individual seasons, buy this set. It has all the episodes and the extended versions.. not to mention having your own Cylon is pretty cool. The downside.. if you hit \\"play all\\" It plays the \\"aired\\" version, then the \\"extended\\" version of the same episode. I found this annoying, I would have preferred to have the episodes sequential with an option on which version to watch. Other than that, the packaging is a pretty good balance between looking nice on the shelf, while staying environmentally friendly (No plastic cases). Price is about the same as buying them individually. (Unless you luck into a deal on used sets.)
0385504225|2.0|Brown's thrillers' wild popularity is due not to quality writing, nor to well fleshed-out characters, but to subject matter, a fact worth thinking about.  Readers would be well advised, with 'The Lost Symbol' as with his other books, to take his assertions of fact cautiously.  Brown's characters habitually break off into expository paragraphs asserting fact, history and philosophy, breaking the action; a better writer would integrate them into the action rather than interrupt it.  I found, too, his villain entirely unbelievable, so far from human as to be ineffective dramatically, and, in the end, failing to serve the message of the book.  That said, the Masonic lore is fascinating.  The breathable fluorinated liquid, by the way, contrary to a skeptic's opinion above, is entirely real, if implausibly used in the story.
B000AARKO4|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, but found it rather confusing at times, particularly the battle scenes. It was often difficult to discern who was who. But the story was good, the costuming was excellent, and the scenery was fantastic. An actual  Spanish castle was used as the main backdrop.     Perhaps, in my case at least, I need to watch the movie one or two more times to understand all that was happening.     Overall, I liked the film very much, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys history and intrigue. I would buy it again, and I felt it was well worth the cost.
B00004W3L3|5.0|I used to spend my college summers in England with family. Marillion was a big hit one of those summers and I ended up with the album which I played and played until all the words became set in my memory.<br />I came across this on Amazon and thought, \\"I'm a lot older now. Will I still enjoy this?\\" I ordered it for fun and I can't believe how great it still is to listen to.<br />All the words came right back to me. I love the way one song doesn't really end and blends into the beginning of the next song with a slightly different theme or story continuation.<br /><br />Misplaced Childhood is not hard to listen to nor is it easy listening. It is great to listen to while walking, cleaning house or driving the car. I love Kayleigh and especially Lavender. I have to say that I have never tried to get another Marillion album though so I have none of their other work to compare it to.
0316017922|3.0|Outliers is very similar to Gladwell's previous works.  He shares interesting stories about what it really takes to succeed- usually a combination of hard work and being lucky.  Most of the ideas move along nicely until he gets to the final two chapters on why Asians are better at math and why K-12 students should be in school 12 hours a day and skip summer school.  It gets kind of old to hear the same tired arguments about how our kids would be better off if we threw more money at schools, gave them more standardized tests, kept them in school longer, fill in the blank bandaid.  What Gladwell doesn't even consider is the obvious answer: kids do well in schools when their parents are very involved in their childrens' education.  It would've been refreshing to see Gladwell talk about how if every parent across America was very involved in their kids education, we wouldn't need all of the problem solving for K-12.  I also never heard him talk about how much it costs to run a school like the one he described in the last chapter.  Again, overall great start to the book but the last two chapters were very unoriginal and uninspiring.

0525951113|5.0|Daniel Suarez picks up where Michael Crichton left off - with a technological science fact-fiction adventure set in today's world... the book reads like ANDROMEDA STRAIN or AIRFRAME - with all the background research and realism one would expect from a Crichton novel.  The big differences between this book and one of Crichton's are:<br /><br />1) This book really delves deep into the computer network and tech world - a place Crichton never really went into in detail.<br />2) Suarez obviously actually has ridden a motorcyle, as the motorcycle-related sequences are actually believable.<br />3) This book ends with a clear opening to a sequel.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the sequel FREEDOM(TM)... oh, and be sure to read Crichton's STATE OF FEAR.

It is a beautiful book filled with love and gives a good idea of what it is to go through the veil to the other side.  It is filled with hope, joy and knowingness that they are in good hands and are happy.  I have passed it on to family members and they have told me how much it meant to them. This is just one of the many books I have purchased from Amazon.com.
B00004ZBVG|4.0|Great story and was sorry to hear that Lt. Col. Iceal \\"Ham\\" Hambleton recently passed away.
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|- Spectacular special effects and action scenes.    - Hugh Jackman's appearance and acting is gripping. I believe he's one of the main reasons why people watched this movie.    - As for character developments, there was a little bit but not enough to make it a meaningful movie. For example the love between Wolverine and his wife (Lynn Collins) is only briefly depicted. The relationship between Wolverine and his brother (played by Live Schreiber) shows good contrast and conflict. It gives me something to think about. It makes the movie a little deeper than it looks. Live Schreiber is convincing and looks scary as the main villain.     - In short, this film is absolutely worth watching
0007183305|5.0|Very small but thick packed with tons of info.  Great to throw in your backpack for reference on pretty much any survival topic.  Way more complete than the U.S. Army survival manual.  FYI this SAS survival guide has no military info (ie. evasion, camo, etc.) if you were expecting that.  In a survival situation would definitely help you stay alive and signal rescue or walk out if need be.
0393061310|4.0|A real reviewer once wrote: \\"Jared Diamond is suspected to be a pseudonym for a committee of experts\\". He (or she) had a point. Jared Diamond's book \\"Guns, germs and steel\\" could very well be re-titled The Book About Everything. It's a very ambitious undertaking. Essentially, the author wants to explain the main lines of human history for the past 15,000 years!<br /><br />The book is very interesting, and I don't doubt that Diamond is right on many points. However, I also suspect that he is just as wrong on many others. Indeed, I found myself agreeing with the author all the way until the epilogue, where he fell flat to his face. Diamond became charcoal, as it were. Still, Jared Diamond should be commended for at least trying to analyze the big issues of human history and prehistory. In that sense, \\"Guns, germs and steel\\" is a must read. (Incidentally, I know that Jared Diamond is a high-ranking professor. That just makes it more fun disagreeing with him, don't you think?)<br /><br />[THE QUESTIONS ADRESSED BY THE BOOK]<br /><br />\\"Guns, germs and steel\\" addresses the following questions. First, why did most high cultures appear in Eurasia and North Africa? Indeed, why did the first high cultures appear in these regions? Second, why where the Eurasian and North African high cultures more technologically advanced, and developed faster, than the high cultures that did appear in sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas? Third, why did no high culture ever appear in pre-colonial Australia? (I'm using the term \\"high culture\\" in a neutral sense. It's simply a culture with cities, an advanced division of labour, technology, etc.)<br /><br />Diamond believes that the reasons are geographical and environmental, rather than genetic or \\"racial\\". He often explicitly argues against racist arguments. This may strike a sophisticated European reader as somewhat strange, until one remembers that the racist work \\"The Bell Curve\\" was a best seller in the United States only a few years before \\"Guns, germs and steel\\" was published. Diamond doesn't like to be called an environmental determinist, but it's hard to resist the temptation to call him precisely that. At the very least, he is strongly influenced by such ideas.<br /><br />[THE ROLE OF DOMESTICATED ANIMALS AND PLANTS]<br /><br />Diamond points out that many species of animals and plants in Eurasia could be domesticated. This was not true in America, Africa and Australia. There were no large mammals in America and Australia at all. Africa is teeming with large mammals but, by a curious accident, virtually none can be domesticated. Attempts to domesticate zebras or antelopes have all failed. This means that Eurasia got a head start in developing agriculture and the kind of massive food production necessary to sustain a high culture.<br /><br />Eurasia also got the better deal in terms of technology. Large domesticated animals are needed to pull wagons. The wheel was therefore invented in Eurasia. The Aztec empire didn't have such animals (none were available), so naturally they never used wheels. In the same way, domestication of animals also paved the way for military success. Europeans and Asians had a cavalry. The Aztecs and Incas had none, and where thus quickly overwhelmed by the Spanish. Diamond points out, somewhat sarcastically, that if rhinos could be domesticated, Africans would have conquered the world!<br /><br />Another factor is germs. Many epidemic diseases originally comes from \\"our\\" animals. Europeans therefore had a certain immunity against diseases such as smallpox, whereas American Indians had none. The Aztecs and the Incas were defeated in part because of smallpox epidemics, to which the Spaniards had a higher immunity. (Conversely, one of the reasons why it took Europeans so long to conquer Africa or reach the interior of New Guinea, was European non-resistance to malaria.)<br /><br />[GEOGRAPHICAL FACTORS FAVOURING DIFFUSION, etc]<br /><br />Another factor favouring Eurasiais the east-west orientation of the vast Eurasian landmass. This made it easy for domesticated plants from the Middle East to be introduced into southern Europe, India or China. All these areas have basically the same climate. It's also (relatively) easy to travel between Europe and Asia, facilitating cultural diffusion. America, by contrast, has a north-south orientation. Also, the various parts of the Americas used to be more isolated from each other due to various geographical factors. This made cultural diffusion more difficult. When the Spanish landed in Peru and attacked the Inca empire, the Incas apparently had no idea that Mexico had already been conquered by Spain! The Inca ruler Atahuallpa naively assumed that Pizarro was just a raider who could be bought off with gold. He never realized that the conquistadors were there to stay.<br /><br />Diamond also points out that Australia and some parts of North America were unsuitable for agriculture, or at least for advanced agriculture. This explains why the Aborigines never developed a high culture. The hunter-gatherer lifestyle was the only feasible one under Australian conditions. Unless, of course, you have *already* developed a high culture, which could then simply be transplanted to Australia, as the English eventually did. But even with such a culture, surviving in Australia wasn't easy. The White explorers who attempted to cross Australia's hinterland fared less well than the Aborigines, since Western technology didn't do much good in the outback. As for the Tasmanians, their extremely low level of technology is due to Tasmania's isolation from the rest of the world. Other isolated cultures also regressed technologically. The Chapham Islands is another example.<br /><br />But what about cultural factors? Diamond believes that some cultures are indeed more conservative, while others are more innovative. Here, he strays from \\"environmental determinism\\", since he attributes these factors to local idiosyncrasies. However, the sheer number of cultures that can be reached by cultural diffusion was higher in Eurasia than in America or Australia. Therefore, cultural innovation nevertheless became more likely in the Eurasian context.<br /><br />[A PROBLEMATIC EPILOGUE]<br /><br />So far, I think Diamond has made an eloquent case. The problem comes in the epilogue, where he tries to wrap up his theory, and connect the broad geographic-environmental perspective with questions about contingency, the role of individuals in world history, etc. He never really succeeds in this. In this last section of the book, Diamond also attempts to answer a fourth question: Why did the western part of the Eurasian landmass, the backwater known as Europe, eventually overtake not only America, Africa and Australia, but also Asia? After all, China, India and the Muslim world had an enormous head start compared to Europe. Then, something happened, around AD 1500.<br /><br />To Diamond, Europe's eventual dominance over Asia can also be explained by environmental and geographic factors. This is not convincing at all. Diamond is right to point out that the decentralized character of 15th century Europe actually worked in Columbus' favour, since the Italian adventurer could lobby a large amount of kings and princes with his proposal for a westward voyage to \\"India\\". In China, by contrast, the centralized form of government proved disadvantageous to Chinese expansionism - when the emperor ordered that China shouldn't expand, that was it. The problem is that Diamond explains the centralization of China and the decentralization of Europe as inevitable consequences of geography. I beg to disagree. I consider it a contingent fact.<br /><br />Europe was united for centuries by the Romans. Diamond writes that \\"only\\" half of Europe was under Roman control. True, but surely it was the better half! What if the Muslims had defeated Charles Martell or (much later) conquered Vienna? Then, large parts of Europe would once again have become \\"united\\". Diamond also writes that Napoleon and Hitler never united Europe. I don't know much about the Napoleonic wars, but Hitler *did* come very close to winning World War Two. There simply aren't any major geographical obstacles to uniting the important parts of Europe. Conversely, there have been periods in Chinese history when China was divided in many small states. That decentralization worked in Colombus' favour was also a contingent fact. After all, the Catholic monarchs of Spain almost rejected him as well. And what if the Europeans had decided to appease the Ottomans instead of fighting them? Then, Europe would have lost interest in westward journeys. Another curious argument put forward by the author is that deforestation in the Middle East made the centre of power move westward, to Greece and Rome, and then to northern Europe. This is a blatantly Euro-centric argument: in reality, Persia was just as strong as the Roman Empire, the Arabs were stronger than the \\"empires\\" of medieval Europe, and the Ottoman Empire was strongest during the 16th century, and it was still quite powerful two centuries later, i.e. during the same time as the European powers expanded internationally.<br /><br />Thus, I can't see how \\"macroevolutionary\\" factors of geography or environment can explain why Europe managed to get ahead of the Muslims, Indians and Chinese.<br /><br />Finally, there seems to be a curious tendency in Jared Diamond's later book \\"Collapse\\" to reverse environmental determinism in favour of a different perspective, zooming in on various idiosyncratic cultural factors.<br /><br />Still, I regard Professor Diamond (or should I call him Jared?) as a highly erudite and stimulating author, and recommend his books to everyone interested in world history.ion was higher in Eurasia than in America or Australia.

0385504225|4.0|For Da Vinci Code fans suffering though Dan Brown's long hiatus, \\"The Lost Symbol\\", while formulaic, will not disappoint.  Harvard professor Robert Langdon stays a lot closer to his Cambridge home this time around, as he is lured to Washington, DC, by old friend and mentor Peter Solomon, the ultra-wealthy head of the Smithsonian Institution.  Wasting little time to get the adrenaline flowing, Solomon turns up kidnapped, leaving a grisly clue beneath the dome of the US Capitol Building.  Soon Langdon scrambling for clues and playing hide-and-seek with a shadowy branch of the CIA in a frenzied attempt to save his friend's life.  As with \\"Da Vinci' and \\"Angels and Demons\\" before it, ancient symbology and historical minutia is the core around which Brown spins the action, this time diving deep into the lore and secret rituals of the Masons, and the connection between the Masons and the US Founding Fathers.  The Masons are arguably the least understood and most commonly maligned \\"secret\\" society in history, standard fare for conspiracy theorists and a seemingly inexhaustible stream of second-rate thrillers and B movies.  But Brown covers this delicate topic with an even hand, treating this venerable group with a revealing intelligence and due respect.  This makes for a riveting page-turner crafted around an impossibly diabolical antagonist, a cleverly fiendish tattooed hulk who calls himself \\"Mal'akh.\\"  Rapid-fire chapters, a nicely done link between ancient wisdom and the arcane emerging field of science known as \\"Noetics\\", the study of the unhidden power of collective human thought, lead through a series of non-stop cliffhangers to a well hidden twist at the finish line.<br /><br />Where the heretical theme of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" infuriated many Christian's, Brown tones down the rhetoric here, striking a fair balance between the secular and the spiritual.  In fact, and perhaps as appeasement to some of those he may have offended, there is a deeply spiritual element to \\"Lost Symbol\\" that is thought provoking in topics ranging from the substance of the soul to the relevance and immortality of The Bible.  With enough conspiracy to keep the black helicopter crowd happy - including actual black helicopters - and some unabashed but enjoyable similarity to the \\"National Treasure\\" films add up for a fast, entertaining, and educational read.<br /><br />Of course, it is not perfect.  While Langdon's \\"brains over brawn\\" is a refreshing change to the typical 44-Magnum-toting pop thriller protagonist, the thin, stereotyped characters and lame dialog are classic Dan Brown.  The breakneck pace falters near the end, dragging on an overly long 60-plus pages after the true climax.  And as Brown has his own history of playing a bit loose with some of his facts, there is little doubt that parts of \\"Lost Symbol\\" will frustrate the purists out there.  But for the rest of us, this is a riveting page-turner and lots of fun - another Brown thrill fest where plot and context trump the deficiencies, including all the ingredients for another wild bestseller that most will love while infuriating others who, as with Da Vinci code before it, will love to hate it.mbol\\" that is thought provoking in topics ranging from the substance of the soul to the relevance and immortality of The Bible.

0061729078|5.0|A classic for decades, I recommend this to anyone interested in the effects of psychedelics.  Not only is Doors of Perception included in this book, but also Heaven and Hell, and other Huxley essays.
0385504225|2.0|I really enjoyed DVC, and A&D.  Just a few pages into TLS it felt like the 2 page chapters were an attempt to meet a publishers deadline and fill space.    I love the research and background that are Brown's signature.  However, the storytelling itself lacks art and elegance.  It feels like he shoves the history/background/research/architecture into a common formula.  The Masonic descriptions seemed to be respectful.  I have to confess I was expecting more Joseph Smith/Mormonism references for a 'American' centric exploration of early U.S. history, architecture and mythology.    I was expecting better story and evolving/improving style.
1932100660|5.0|I honestly believe the author's connection between animal protein and the diseases of the developed world (heart disease/cancer/diabetes) is the most important nutritiional issue ever suggested. As an example, historically all other nutritionalists and doctors have erroneously connected fat with high cholesterol levels (at least in my case).  The author correctly connected the protein of animals with cholesterol levels and my cholesterol level went down 50 points.  Read this book; it can save your life.

0385504225|2.0|As someone who enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, I'd just like to say the following:    Dear Reader:      Wait for the paperback....really!!!  You know how some authors write some enjoyable novels that make a fortune then throw out some mediocre fluff because they know with their name on the cover it will fly off the shelf?  Well, it happened again.  Really!  Signed,  Wasted anticipation and money      Dear Dan Brown:     Six years of waiting for this?  Really!  Here's what I think happened...you had a contract to get a new novel out this year but you spent the last 5 1/2 years enjoying yourself with all the money you made...okay, you earned it...enjoy!  But wait, now you have to hustle and get a novel to the publisher.  No problem, you think as you take out the outline for the previous books.  Instead of the grail, you'll make it some \\"Lost Symbol\\" mainly because you're at a lose as to how you're going to meet that deadline.  For the female role, you'll turn her into a scientist in some unknown field.  Just so you can have another female star in the movie, you'll throw in a CIA agent.  Instead the crazy priest, you'll make that role just a plain psycho that another Hollywood hunk can play.  You'll go through the motions but this time Langford won't be as sharp as before which makes sense because you aren't either. Instead of the Catholic church, you'll use the Masons because you can Google Masons and get all kinds of alledged secrets and mysteries as you sit by the pool and sip on some expensive scotch.  You'll use Washington DC because, like the Masons, it's easy to Google and maybe you've seen National Treasure.  Okay, that takes care of the first 2/3 of the book.  You're almost there and you can see the money rolling in so you just wrap up the whole package with your optimism and hope that you can pull it off.  Well, congratulations.  It worked and I was amoung the million that were suckered on the 15th.  I give you one star for the book and one star for the balls.  I hope you enjoy my money but, Mr. Brown, please know that I don't believe you earned it and I don't think even you do.  Really.   Signed,  Disappointed

Don't think so, even in the approx 12 hour period the book takes place. Just one of the many plot holes and absurdities in the book. It was somewhat entertaining, but I'll read his next book for free at my favorite brick and mortar store, rather than spend good money. Or wait a few months when the surplus goes on sale for less than a paperback.
0385504225|5.0|I think most of the Dan Brown fans were chomping at the bit to get their paws on The Lost Symbol. A book about the Masons and the founding fathers' showing the way to unity of spirit.<br />The book starts with a bang - Our friend Robert Langdon is called to sub for an old friend Peter Solomon for a speech at the Capitol! A private jet is sent, limo takes him to the spot he needs to be, but - there is nothing there and nothing scheduled that evening!<br />As Langdon is trying to figure out what the deal is - they find a hand of a man wearing a 32nd Degree Masonic ring literally staked to the floor - with a call for Robert Langdon who immediately recognizes the hand as his friend and mentor Peter Solomon. Yikes!<br />What a brilliant start to a book. As a matter of fact the events of the book proceed in an amazingly fast and furious pace, then get stymied in Katherine Solomon's (Peter Solomon's brilliant sister) secret experiments. Her work is very important to the book, but not fully explained, so it tended to slow the action down.

0143034901|4.0|The Shadow of the wind is a book that can incorporate many different interests. The book includes some mystery and some love story and everything in between. The plot of the story is very complex and it can be tough to follow. A problem that I had was reading the book and then not picking it up for a week or so. This made it nearly impossible to remember everything that happened. The text requires the reader to focus on the story line very carefully.<br />  Once finishing the novel and reviewing I found it to be very interesting. After realizing some of the connections that I didn't pick up on the first time, I had an epiphany and saw where the book was trying to go.  The novel will keep you reading. I would suggest this book to someone who likes a long drawn out plot opposed to a quick read (both are good).
B00006EXCC|5.0|Back when I was poppin' zits and chasing cheer leaders, buying gas and cigs for nineteen cents a gallon and pack, this album was released in US. The execs screwed us and I didn't even know it. I did wonder why mothers little helper was released as a single, but not on an album until flowers, me thinks. Now, the UK version.....Just the BEST Stones disc of all time. This was made when the boys were still hungry, which they haven't been for over thirty years. I believe Brian Jones had a good influence on them here. Buy it!
B000H0MKOC|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater.  Besides being hilarious, this flick is a how to in BSing.      Anyway, the acting was on point, especially Aaron Eckhart, who until I saw him in this film, that I finally took notice.  In this film his character Nick Nayler is not a one dimensional character who is just a quick witted, smooth talking,  lobbyist, but someone who is also a caring father...   Aaron is great in this film.      So, I highly recommend this film for its smart writing, great acting and one of the messages it sends out which I hold dear to my heart...    \\"Don't be a mindless follower, but instead, think for yourself?\\"
B001QOGYFE|3.0|\\"Whiteout\\" is an implausible but enjoyable thriller set at the South Pole.  In its opening sequence, set in 1957, a Soviet cargo plane carrying a mysterious cargo goes down somewhere in Antarctica.  In the present, the Amundsen-Scott Scientific Station at the South Pole is preparing to rotate out its summer crew and batten down for the winter darkness, just ahead of an approaching storm.  US Marshal Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) is preparing to depart, along with her doctor friend (a grizzled but amiable Tom Skerrit).<br /><br />The discovery of a body on the ice triggers an investigation that leads in short order to an old Soviet scientific station, another dead body, a killer, and the Soviet cargo plane, minus its mysterious cargo.  Stetko is assisted in her investigation by the doctor, an aircraft pilot (Columbus Short) and a UN Security Officer (Gabriel Macht).  The group, almost inevitably, becomes trapped in an evacuated station with the killer or killers.<br /><br />Stetko, traumatized by betrayal in a previous assignment told in flashback, finds she can't trust anyone in her present.  The action sequences inside and outside the station work well, moving the audience quickly past some plot holes and cold weather implausibilities to a twisty ending.  \\"Whiteout\\" isn't going to win any awards, but manages to be moderately entertaining.  Canada does stand in for the Antarctic with some stunning exteriors.
0385504225|5.0|I can't believe The Lost Symbol is getting low ratings.  It is an amazing book.  Instead of focusing too much on the fictional story, readers should pay close attention to the information weaved through it.  It is important. This work can and should change the way people think. Thank you, Dan Brown for having the guts to write about topics that will hopefully excite people to look at their religion  with new eyes, or let's hope a new mind. I found reading \\"The Moses Code\\" helped me understand what Dan Brown is writing about, that the bible is an allegroy with rich lessons to be learned.  Fantastic!

B00260HH3K|3.0|DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION    I have always been a fan of the Manga series Dragonball by Akira Toriyama and each series afterwards like Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT. I liked the written formats and the animes as well so I was excited when this live action film was announced. I was let down a bit when the trailer was released but I never judge without seeing something first. I missed the theatrical release because of reasons unknown to myself, as I did not know when it was out [limited I think could be wrong]. So when the DVD was released I had to see it so off I went with my girl and brother and sat down to hopefully enjoy.    Goku is just a normal every day average young man who has trouble fitting in and getting the girl of his dreams, and can fight like crazy. That of course is his only thing he has going for him but even then his grandfather can whoop him. Any way one day he is invited to Chi Chi's house for a party by her, the girl of his dreams. So after sneaking out and skipping on his tradition he does with his grandpa on his birthday he makes his way to Chi Chi's. Upon arriving a group of guys that usually pick on him are there to continue the torment, until he decides to teach them a lesson, with out throwing a blow. While doing this and impressing Chi Chi his grandfather is attacked by Piccolo an alien who is far more powerful than he is. Piccolo is after the Dragonballs and will stop at nothing to get them including killing all those who are in the way.     So after returning home Goku learns of this and is told by his dying grandfather to find a Master Roshi. From there Roshi can help him keep the Dragonballs safe and teach him to fight Piccolo. This journey to save the world will lead him on a crazy adventure that introduces him to characters such as the lovely Bulma and a guy named Yamcha. All three with the help of Master Roshi set out to find the Dragonballs and stop Piccolo before he can summon another creature that threatens the world.    Well even though that all sounds good the truth of the matter is it really is not the awesome extravaganza that it should have been. This film when first announced had me all kinds of crazy hyped, because for some reason I though they would take this serious enough to make it great. I can understand changing some things for the feature film to make it appeal to a wider audience but there are some things in this that are just, well not good shall we say. Director James Wong as taken a lot of flack for this film and for the most part rightly so, because as the team captain he should have been all over the mistakes in this. The direction at times feels uneven and at others a bit rushed if that makes any sense. At least the action is good but the biggest mistake is the fact that the final battle with Piccolo is way to short. Piccolo is a bad dude and at least they made him look cool in this even though the fight at the end could have been better.    Ben Ramsey messed up with this one; I don't know why he wrote it like this because he has done much better. He directed a recent film that I though was great called \\"Blood & Bone\\" and wrote one of my favorite films called \\"The Big Hit\\". Don't know what he was doing on this one, but oh well I guess. Acting wise this is also a mixed bag because all perform fine at some points and are off at others. Lead Justin Chatwin as Goku falls right into that category doing ok at times and not so much at others. Same can be said for Emmy Rossum as Bulma and Joon Park as Yamcha. Yun-Fat Chow however is good as Master Roshi and does not miss a beat, and Eriko Tamura is great in this as well [and easy to look at]. Randall Duk Kim is good as Goku's grandfather and James Marsters is great as Piccolo.     Now to be honest with you this film is kinda entertaining if you watch it with absolutely no expectations what so ever. For any one whom as know clue about the source material for this or any thing related to it I a pretty sure you would enjoy this. Thisis a popcorn flick for sure nothing but pure entertainment for those who no nothing about it. For those like myself who do know a thing or two about the source material it is kind of frustrating to see this film made like this. Still for those like me who do know turn off expectations and look at it like it is just another flick and it is halfway decent.    Recommend for those who I have mentioned above and a turn off you r brain for this one, mindless fun at best.
1564559149|5.0|This was a trendy book when I read it as a teenager in the 1970s, Eastern religions being in fashion at the time.  When I picked this up again I was surprised to learn that Hesse had won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946.  But having re-read this book, I can appreciate it as a masterpiece and do not begrudge Hesse his prize.<br /><br />The book is essentially a biblical-style parable of the life of Siddhartha, who lives at the time of Buddha and who in fact represents Buddhist philosophy while at the same time criticizing any didactic teachings or following of great teachers.  Siddhartha is the son of a Brahmin who rebels, becomes an ascetic, meets the Buddha, rejects the Buddha in favor of seeking experience, becomes a merchant, and then rejects material things in the latter stages of his life.<br /><br />Siddhartha learns to love things as opposed to words/ideas, to appreciate the unity of all things and the unreality of time, and to love all things (which may set him apart from the Buddha's orthodoxy).<br /><br />What is striking about the book is Siddhartha's suspicion of all things written and of ideas.  Such abstractions are inherently one-sided and cannot capture the more subtle truths of the connectedness and goodness of all things.  This poses a great challenge for the writer -- who is, after all, writing a one-sided text conveying ideas and knowledge.  Yet, it is experience and things that Siddhartha loves.<br /><br />For this reason, Hesse writes with a biblical style.  The book is a short parable of the entire life of a man.  There is no lengthy dialogue or elaborate scenes.  And the style is poetic.  In this way the text avoids being one-sided or didatic and instead becomes a living thing for the reader to ponder and interpret and revisit from time to time, like one would do with scripture.<br /><br />The reader of the audio version is first rate in conveying the poetry of the book, and he uses a new translation that has been well-received.<br /><br />Given the harm done by one-sided ideas during the Twentieth Century, and the angry polemics of contemporary culture wars, Siddhartha's parable has great and timely appeal.  We should allow ourselves to learn more through the simple experience of living life and not be so distracted by ideas and knowledge.  In the end, happiness does appear to lie is appreciating the goodness, inevitability, and connectedness of everything and to realize, as does Siddhartha at the end of the book, that the river is laughing at us.deas during the Twentieth Century, and the angry polemics of contemporary culture wars, Siddhartha's parable has great and timely appeal.

0930289234|5.0|What else can be said about one of TIME's greatest novels of all time, first printed as a comic series from 1986 to '87, now a proper book and a major motion picture with shiny new merchandise?<br /><br />As a matter of fact, there are two things.<br /><br />First, this genius work of art doesn't belong to writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons.  DC Comics was supposed to revert the rights to the authors one year after retiring the property from publication, but that year hasn't happened--or as Alan and Dave might tell you, it hasn't happened YET.<br /><br />The movie rights are another beast.  It took two decades of wrangling to finally shoot the 2009 par for the course film.  The authors again had no control over the production, though Gibbons signed on as an adviser to director Zack Snyder.  Moore has stated Watchmen is unsuitable for film, because he and Gibbons used techniques which showcase the uniqueness of comics to tell a story.  I agree with this assertion, which is no small feat for both writer and artist, rarely accomplished with such breathtaking precision and subtlety, and on such a grand scale.  While the film version conveyed the basics of the plot and characters, the soul and depth of the story were lost on film.  Most glaringly, the ending is significantly altered in the movie.<br /><br />Moore has totally divorced himself from Watchmen, refusing any kind of credit or compensation for the work.  As of this writing, Moore hasn't seen, nor intends to see, Snyder's film.<br /><br />This entire article could easily be written almost verbatim about Alan Moore's fantastic \\"V for Vendetta,\\" with the one major difference being Moore's total disgust with the screenplay (he thought Watchmen's screenplay was about as close as film could come).  Moore is much more careful guarding his intellectual properties these days than he was in the '80s.<br /><br />The second thing which can be said about this seminal piece of comic art, which follows easily from thefirst point, is that buying a new copy of this novel anywhere ensures Moore and Gibbons won't see the rights to their masterpiece returned to them.  This book is a must read, but please, buy a used copy.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|This is my favorite of the Bourne series as it is the middle film where you are right in the center of the action...I think the characters work well together and there is already an inkling of the full back story of how Bourne became who he is. The action is fast-paced and we move with Bourne across the globe. My favorite scenes are those in Russia and Berlin. Highly recommended!
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown has done it again. It's always difficult to follow a big blockbuster with another, better, more exciting one; expecially one as potent as The DaVinci Code; but I feel Dan Brown has done it here.<br />For those who pooh-pooh the dialogue, seek more sex, or feel that the premise is unworthy; Amazon has several hundred thousand alternatives.<br />This is a terrific, historically intriguing, puzzle piece that brings to light hundreds of ancient symbols, legends, vocabulary, stories, people and places; all centered around our Capital and the people ands the allegories stretching across thousands of years linking to those that founded our Republic.<br />What a tangled web of intrigue, history and emotional power.<br />My pulse was racing and sleep relegated to some future point in time.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This is a great movie! This is one of my all time, favorite movie versions of Troy! I have always wondered about the old saying that the Helen of Troy could launch a 1000 ships, because of her beauty! I always wondered why and how that could be done, and this movie gives you a real good idea of how it might have been, and you get the why and how to the \\"Achilles Heel\\" saying. And I have always wondered and hoped that the grand city of Troy really existed! I just love movies about places and people of long ago, you get to step back into time with them, and see how they lived and loved!<br /><br />This is a remarkable story about a grand high walled city being overtaken by a very big and mighty army! You will see a prince of Troy(Orlando Bloom), fall in love with a beautiful woman named Helen, and you will see the heir of Troy, Hector (Eric Bana), who is a very brave and mighty warrior stand up and fight against Achilles (Brad Pitt), who is one of the greatest warriors that ever lived, according to legend! Achilles and Hector are greatly admired by everyone because of their brave courage, and honor, and their skill on a battlefield, and because they have the ability and wisdom to lead men!<br /><br />This story has alot of action, and drama, it has it all; greedy lust for power, revenge, desire, love, war, heartbreak, courage, bravery, death, jealousy! I loved the beautiful costumes, and clothes, and all the grandeaur of the city of Troy, and the stunning visual scenes of the war and the mighty armies!<br /> Ladies there is alot of handsome men in this movie, and Guys there is alot of action in this movie!<br /><br />My favorite scene in this movie is when the King of Troy(Peter O'Toole) makes a surprise vist to Achilles, and I just loved this scene, it touched my heart. Peter O'Toole and Brad Pitt and Eric Bana did a outstanding job in this movie, they were just awesome! And I think that the people behind the scenes in making this movie did a outstanding job also, you can tell that a lot of hard work went into making this movie, because it is so real and alot of attention was paid to all these wonderful details, that made it so real and successful!<br /><br /> I love ALL the handsome men in this movie and there was hundreds of them, and of course I loved Orlando Bloom, and I just loved Brad Pitt with his handsome self, as Achilles! WOW! I also loved the handsome king, that was Achilles friend; they all kept my eyes glued to the TV scene, but the one that touched my heart, and took my breath away with his handsome brave self was Hector,(Eric Bana)! This was the first time that I ever saw Eric Bana in any movie, and I thought he was just beautiful, and he became my favorite hero, he just melted my heart, with his courage and wisdom and his awesome beauty! I highly recommend this movie, I just loved it!rd work went into making this movie, because it is so real and alot of attention was paid to all these wonderful details, that made it so real and successful!

B001U0HBPG|1.0|This movie is about time--time that moves forward for some people, backward for others. But for those who watch this movie, time won't move at all. You will feel as if you are trapped forever in an ever-changing, but somehow, never-changing time warp of pseudo-profound revelations, full of sound bites and fury, signifying nothing--because nothing is what this movie is all about. Really. Absolutely nothing. Not even Brad Pitt imitating Tom Hanks imitating a Georgia cretin could save this film. And that's saying a lot.<br /><br />Now that I mention it, Queenie's \\"You never know what's comin' at ya\\" sounds an awful lot like \\"Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get.\\" And \\"Some people are artists, some people dance, etc.\\" sounds just like \\"There's an awful lot you can tell about a person by their shoes. Where they're going. Where they've been.\\" Could it be that Benjamin Button actually IS Forrest Gump moving forward in time? Or, even more thrilling, could it be that Tom Hanks is Brad Pitt moving backward in time? Does this mean that Brad Pitt will eventually end up on an island, talking to a volley ball? Or, most tantalizing of all, could it be that someday Hollywood writers will go far enough back in time that they will finally come up with an original idea?<br /><br />My recommendation is this: Don't waste 2 hours and 45 minutes of your precious forward-moving time. You will only be one hundred and sixty-five minutes older, and will have gained no greater insight into the true nature of life, love, and dancing. Instead, go get a copy of The Confessions of Max Tivoli (the book) and read it. It's another take on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald that inspired this film, but, unlike this dreadfully tedious movie, it is not a waste of your time.
0385504225|1.0|Well, all I can say is that I am thoroughly disappointed.  I felt I was being fed answers to FAQs about Freemasons. Though, by comparison to his other books, he did manage to write a slightly passable ending (or maybve  I was just so relieved that the ending had actually come).     I think Dan Brown has worn out his formula and unfortunately his writing has not improved or matured. If anything, it seemed at its worst this time when I felt I was reading a screen play rather than a novel. The combination of these things have made this book fairly unreadable and dull.     That having been said, where was the editor??? No doubt put to sleep by the repetitive formula page after page after page. Never have I skipped so many pages and not lost the plot of a novel. Oh well, certainly a shame.

0385504225|1.0|I rarely write reviews of books I dislike, but I don't want people to waste their money on the hardback edition of this.      I liked The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons, and even Deception Point and Digital Fortress. This book, however, jumped the shark.  I figured out the major plot twist a third of the way into the book, and fell asleep 3 times during the last chapters of the book, when all the big reveals happen.  It was THAT boring.      Brown took his formula one book too far.  If I said anything else, it would involve spoilers, and I hate to do that.  This is a HO HUM book if I ever read one.

From a life that could have been a dysfunctional disaster (no Father in residence, Mother only around sporadically, and hopping from school to school) he managed to extract the best of all of these and come out a fantastic person, a successful family man, a caring positive individual who has attained the ultimate prize.  In spite of all the criticism and spite aimed at him you know after reading this book that he will endure.
0385504225|1.0|Unfortunately the book is going to be a bestseller because of Dan Brown's previous books and the movie spin-offs.  I wish I hadn't contributed to this by putting in a pre-publication order for my Kindle.  Although Dan Brown has never been a great stylist, I admit I've enjoyed his previous books.  So I can understand someone wanting to read this book, if only to be a part of a sociological phenomenon.  But this current offering is nothing but a rehash....Robert Langdon is tricked into undertaking a quest to solve a mystery that requires his skill in symbology while working with a female companion, meeting cognescenti guides along the way, coming against true-believer villians, and finding meaning in architecture of famous buildings.  The format is the same as the previous books:  very short chapters moving back and forth between characters and time and the plot slowing unfolds admixed with bomastic philosophizing with Langdon playing sceptic.  If your looking for an action novel, the action actually is over about 85% into the book.  Along the way, Brown manages to make some interesting ideas REALLY BORING by putting them in condesending new age and pseudoscientific packaging.  Even the puzzles are pretty lame; the author even admits they are simple and obvious.  Well, maybe Washington DC tourism will benefit.

0385504225|3.0|The difficulty with this book is that of course it can't live up to the expectations that The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons created. And while I tried to put those expectations aside, The Lost Symbol wouldn't let me forget them. While I appreciate the research that goes into his books, Brown is now writing to a very distinct formula: \\"the ticking time bomb\\" technique, those who know secrets won't reveal them; the uncertainty of who is good versus who is bad (and at some points in the book, the reader stops caring); the shocking twist that is revealed near the end. If I hadn't read anything else by Brown, I would have enjoyed the book much more--but having read them, I can only say that I feel like I've already read The Lost Symbol, and the two other versions were better (especially since the \\"shocking twist\\" is fairly obvious a couple hundred pages earlier).<br />But it does earn 3 stars in my book, because weak Dan Brown is still better than a lot of the other popular fiction out there. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced read, I recommend it.

If you enjoyed The DaVinci Code and Angles and Demons, you will enjoy this book.  If you did not, nothing's changed, so you will find the same stuff to complain about.      I found the concept of \\"Noetic Science\\" to be hokey, Dan Brown's inability to use the word \\"penis\\"  in favor of \\"sex organ\\" to be oddly incongruous with the tone of the novel, and the wealth of the Solomon family was presented like a grocery store Romance author might.  The cheesiness doesn't ever go away, but the story is gripping enough to make the book an entertaining read.
0385504225|2.0|First all, I enjoyed Dan Brown's previous books tremendously, particularly 'Angels and Demons' and 'The Da Vinci' code. It's said that in his books he takes certain liberties with historical facts -- he got a fair amount of heat for that over the two books named, to the point that people felt they needed to counter it by writing other books explaining the fallacies, especially with regard to information about Jesus, Mary, and the Catholic church. But of course we all realize it's fiction, not fact.     However this book leaves his others behind when it comes to accurate representation of facts, we are into pure fantasy for most of the book. Near the beginning we learn there is scientific research that shows people can influence external objects using only their mind, reinforcing the ideas behind ESP and telekinesis. Of course there is NO such scientific evidence. Later on, a researcher accurately weighs someone as they're dying, and in so doing determines the weight of the \\"soul\\" leaving the body. In this case not only is the scientific evidence lacking to support that, the experiment has actually been done, and with exactly the opposite result -- there's no weight change during death. Brown has apparently drunk the Dean Koontz kool-aid and crossed over into accepting the reality of spirits, demons, etc.      The final quarter of the book could be considered a religious tract. Is this book perhaps penance for his previous works? Is Brown trying to appease the church by winning converts for them with this book? Or has he recently had a religious experience or conversion of his own, and is just trying to share the \\"good news\\" through his work?     Combine that with \\"twists\\" that are telegraphed long in advance and aren't the least surprising (at least to anyone who reads mysteries or Brown's previous books); various new weapon technologies that have been pretty fully explored in other fiction; yet another psycho bad guy that must be stopped at all costs; and cookie-cutter, jack-booted representatives of the government (in this case the CIA). Probably the most interesting aspect of the book is the description of various trivia regarding Washington DC, including its architecture.     If this book existed in isolation, i.e. if it were Brown's first novel, I'd give it an average rating. But it's a disappointment after his previous books, particularly after waiting for it for 6 years.
0385504225|2.0|Let's face it: Dan Brown never was a great writer. His books have always been formulaic, the characters cookie-cutter, and the writing style is atrocious. This book, while moderately entertaining, does not match Angels & Demons or The Da Vinci Code. Had this been Dan Brown's first novel, he would not have become an international celebrity. I expect that many of his future novels will be billed as \\"his best since The Da Vinci code\\" and not as \\"his best since The Lost Symbol.\\" I will not comment on too much of the specifics of the book because I should not spoil the reading. Nonetheless, the revelation at (or near) the end of the story is rather anticlimactic. The characters often do things and/or behave in ways that would be extremely unlikely under the conditions presented - their health and/or psychological condition would be simply prohibitive. The bad guy in the story (Mal'akh) grew very tall under the influence of \\"growth hormone\\" and \\"steroids\\" after the age of 18. That is totally impossible because epiphyseal closure of the bones' growth plates eliminate the tissue on which growth hormone of any kind could act. I am not criticizing the elements of the book that were absolutely needed for the plot, but even the non-essentials are often misguided. We could go on and on with the \\"insights\\" the book has to offer. It is, in the end, pulp - and if you read it as such, you will be entertained, unless your taste for more refined writing will intervene.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I used this DVD throughout my last pregnancy. It is challenging without being overwhelming. I was in good shape before I became pregnant, and still found this challenging enough. Now, I am in the first trimester of my second pregnancy, and I still love it. The workout is relaxed, and I don't feel out of breath at any point, but when I am finished, my muscles feel fatigued (in a good way). I also like that you can do the entire workout in your living room without any special equipment. I highly recommend this DVD!
B00004XMTJ|3.0|Picture a little blurry. Looks like a bad copy off of an old vcr tape. Not a remastered product.
0316168815|5.0|This book was very good, I enjoyed it very much. The first couple of chapters are a bit hard to get through, especially if you have a daughter, or in my case, a sister the same age as the girl in the book. After you get through those chapters, you can really see why the detail is necessary and the much of the symbolism in the book depends on the harder parts. I thought this book was a very good read, but I would caution some of the younger readers away from this. A mature 14 year old might be ok.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|I travelled from my galaxy to the realm of the movie theater to view Star Trek on Tuesday, September 15, 2009.  I have been mezmerised with the original series since it first ran so many years ago.  I give thanks to Desilu for backing such a risky venture.  The original characters caught my attention early on and I truly enjoyed the series on television.  i own the series and the movies with the original actors.    Early on the attempt to bring about the history of the characters you see a young James Kirk growing up in the farm lands.  That is realistic since Kirk came from Ft. Wayne.  However, the next you see is Kirk driving an antique vehicle at top speed toward a cliff and subsequently the vehicle drops over the cliff.  This is not acceptable.  Kirk's affinity for antiques would have never permitted this to happen, no matter how young he was.  When the officer asked his name, the reply, \\"James Tiberius Kirk\\" would not have happened.   Kirk did not offer his middle name, just the initial.    The new character of Kirk lost me because he was so very belligerent.  Kirk was highly stuck on himself originally, but he never would have acted so arrogantly in his youth.  I feel the original Kirk would have demonstrated from early on his one-eyed direction to join Star Fleet to the exclusion of everything else.    The character of Spock was not done well.  Any Vulcan that had reached the acceptance to the steps of Kolinar would have control of their emotions.  Every step Spock took in the movie was laced with emotion.  Uhura?  No.  She was provacative but never one to chase Spock early on.  She would not have been demonstrative to demand assignment to Enterprise.  She may not have liked going to the Faragut, but she would have resigned herself to the task.  I feel this could have been handled more prodigiously.    I feel the character of Doctor McCoy was spot on.  I give this character and the actor portraying the doctor five stars.  His usage of spicy language was perfect with the mindset of the original.  What can I say about Scotty?  This is a fit made in hell, not heaven.  This portrayal was not acceptable at all.  Scotty was way serious at all times with his engineering duties and studies.  Yes, he did drink but not to excess like this character was made to look.  He was not a bumbler.    The characters of Sulu and Chekov were not fleshed out enough for me.  Chekov did most of the thinking and put his brain to good use.  However, this would not have happened with the original character.    Have I left anyone out?  As you can guess, I did not enjoy the movie, in fact, I fell asleep during parts of the effects.  I know you cannot find perfection later in life, but could some of the plots and reactions have been more to the original?  Movies work on compression of life and the characters must start fast and end even faster to create the effect you want to see.  But I felt rushed and did not like it.    I gave the movie two stars simply from a nostalgic point of view, however, I will watch for future reviews of this first attempt to relive the early stages of the film and carefully consider the future installments.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started this weighing 160lbs and flabby! After about a month, I've lost 10lbs and gained a lot of muscle. I lost an inch off my waist and 3 inches off my hips! I did this exercise along with my own diet (just being aware of what I was eating and watching my portions - easy stuff!)and now I actually have abs lol. I like that this is short and since there is hardly any rest time, 20 minutes will go by even faster. Losing the weight and being active really sky rocketed my confidence level and made me a way happier person. I now hike, swim, and do anything else I've always wanted to do but put off cuz I told myself I couldn't do it. Jillian is a great motivator and after this, I think I'm going to purchase some of her other DVDs to try.

0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown, in my opinion, has always struggled with his writing. He generally weaves an interesting story, but he does not have the writing skill to be a great author. In his newest novel, The Lost Symbol, Dan Brown's writing is worse than usual. Normally I would push past this and attempt to find interest in the story, but in The Lost Symbol even the story is weak.     This book was a challenge to get through. The writing was very formulaic. While reading I got the sense that Dan Brown was just showing off his knowledge about conspiracies. The plot never came together to form a cohesive story. I kept waiting for the author to pull everything together at the end of the novel in a way that would explain away the many confusing tid-bits of information and the many plot holes. The author, in my opinion, never explained the main premises for the book, something he calls the Ancient Mysteries. I never understood exactly what they were. This distanced me from the book on a further level than simply being confused. With previous novels such as The Da Vinci Code I could relate to the book because while Dan Brown was making a ridiculous claim, the claim was based off of a common tale (That of Jesus Christ). The ridiculous claim in this book was based off of a less widely known tale. I felt myself not caring about whatever conspiracy that Dan Brown revealed about the Free Masons, because I did not care about the Free Masons in the first place.    I also found the many religious references to be off putting and fanciful. The author stresses that humans are in fact Deities, and that this is clearly stated in the bible and in all other faiths across the world. Dan Brown, by lumping many religions together and saying that they all share the same message, makes some incorrect statements about many eastern based religions.  The author was grasping at straws with this book. It was clear that by making these sweeping generalizations about religion that he was trying to find another great, or at least semi-believable controversy, liken to that of The Da Vinci Code's Conspiracy. He did not find that controversy. This lack of a controversy or conspiracy meant that Dan Brown could make no shattering realizations with his book. There was no moment when one said, \\"Oh my God. That kinda makes sense in a ridiculous way.\\" I felt that this was why the author could not pull together the novel in the last chapters. There was nothing to pull together. There was no sweeping statement to be made. This left the reader very unsatisfied at the end of the book.    This dissatisfaction with the story as well as the truly atrocious writing made this book truly unbearable. I realize that many people will feel compelled to read this book out of tribute or duty to the books author, but I would suggest that the reader should not bother. The Dan Brown that wrote The Da Vinci Code is gone. He has run out of stories to tell. Please take my word and do not spend your money on this purchase. I will confess that I had reservations about purchasing this book in the first place, but I felt and obligation to read it, as my surname is Solomon, which coincidently is the surname that one of the books main characters has. I however, am not incredibly wealthy, nor am I a prominent Free Mason.
B0000029AP|5.0|This is a great old Aerosmith album. It sounds good and has many good songs such as Sweet Emotion, Walk This Way and Big Ten Inch Record. This CD is well worth the money!
6304498969|5.0|I first had a cassette of this performance, then got a CD, then VHS and now, finally, DVD. It's a wonderful concert. I happen to love acoustic versions of rock songs when well done. Layla was a revelation; no screaming like an animal in pain, just a thoughtful take on immense pain. Tears In Heaven is heartbreaking, esp. when you know the story behind it. The blues stuff was the reason I bought it originally. This is what EC wanted to do all along, and I am very glad he did it, since he has since done more traditional blues, and less rock stuff. Thank you, Mr. Clapton.    I have to ask, though, about the DVD version I have. I finally turned it off after the show started over for the third time. How many times is it on there? And why is it repeated so many times? Is it in lieu of extras, to fill the space on the disc? Whatever. But they could at least have separated them into a menu, so you don't have to stop the DVD in the middle of playing. Very weird.   This is one of the older side closure DVD cases; is there a newer pressing of this with a \\"keepcase\\" that only has the show on it once? I would buy it if there is such a thing.    EDIT 3/25/10:    I have since been informed that there is nothing wrong with the DVD, and that the concert is only on there once. What happens is that the DVD automatically starts over, instead of just stopping. This was one of the first DVDs to come out and I guess they just didn't have the technology down...
0385504225|1.0|I know the book from its Audible version. Reading/listening to it is an absolute waste of time. The plot is an insult to common sense. After Da Vinci's Code, it seems so predictable. It adds nothing new. Highly unrecommended!

0385504225|3.0|Having read through the book in a weekend sitting I have to say this can only represent a downward spiral for Dan Brown.<br /><br />After the popularity of Da Vinci Code it would be hard in fairness to the author to match that book however this is weak in the extreme.  There are several reasons for this the main one being holding the book back for so long (Keeping it under lock and key) Giving a handful of newspapers 50 odd pages to review (As though you could even get a half decent review from that especially considering the book is over 500 pages) Made the reader feel that they were getting a top quality read here.<br /><br />Unfortunately this is just seen it all before, read it all before and frankly lost interest.  This book, is much less Da Vinci and much more regressing to his previous books where the reader is frankly bored to death with tedious technological ramblings posed as intellectual snobbery.  The book centers around Langdon being summoned to Washington DC at (He assumes) The invitation of an old friend and mentor to give a last minute lecture on his behalf, unbeknown to him he has been summoned on false pretence by a mysterious individual who has in fact kidnapped his old friend and is using him as a bartering tool to convince Langdon to assist him in revealing a lost secret (That coincidental Langdons old friends sister is also working on but by scientific means rather than symbolic/religious and it seems has found the answer)  I wont bother revealing this great \\"Secret\\" So I dont spoil what plot there is or amazon delete the review but trust me, you are not missing mutch.<br /><br />Que the secret society (Illuminati in Angels and Demons Opus Dei in Da Vinci) This time its the Masons (Though the Masons are in fact the good guys here, protecting the worlds secrets from, well the world at large it would seem)  Its almost as if Brown has took his que from the film \\"National Treasure\\" We can only assume that its only if you are a Catholic, Jew, Muslim that you are de facto an extremist hell bent on death and destruction if you are a Mason however you are just missunderstood.<br /><br />Instead of the plump bungling French detective we have a 4\\"9 Japanese woman who is the head of the CIA (And for some reason has a remarkable degree of ignorance of history but dont worry Langdon helps her out) Bungling police, our usual dastardly villain this time Mal'ak a multi millionaire (Who spent some time in a Turkish jail) with almost super human strength and a taste for tattoos and a spray tan that covers them with remarkable skill (He needs to tell us what brand that is he would make a fortune on most council estates in the UK)  Instead of a villainous monk.  Langdon runs through endless tunnels under the US capital (Same as Angels and Demons in Rome) deciphers puzzles and ancient mysteries, hooks up with his old friends sister, escapes from the police, gets help from a few Mason mates, goes on the run and generally saves the day.<br /><br />The main problems with the book is its just so damn tedious to read.  It really is like a \\"Novel for the thick\\" Brown cant just tell us for example \\"Langon arrived in DC\\" oh no, he has to tell us what the flight plan was, what airport, how nice the plane was, what shoes Langdon worn etc.  He bores us to death with detail that just isnt needed (Such as when Mal'ak disables a lock on a door what chemicals he uses, what they do and what PH they are (Seriously Dan do you think we care?)) Or how about his lectures on symbols, what they \\"Really mean\\" How \\"Most people dont know\\" etc etc...... Take another example when Langdon and female side kick espace on a DC subway.  Brown just cant help himself he cant just say \\"Landgon got on the next train and headed eat\\"  Oh no we have to be treated to what train lines exist in DC what colour the lines are, when they were built, what colour dog the builder owned etc etc I mean who cares?<br /><br />Brown was able to save himself with Da Vinci becausemost people have some knowledge of the Church or even some interest, most of us know what the holy grail is (Even if its just by watching Monty Python) However endless lectures about masons, science and various religious symbols in Browns usual condescending manner is just frankly boring.  A 500 page book that could quite easily have been 300.<br /><br />Oh and by the way Dan.  Soganlik is a district of Kartal/Istanbul not just the name of a prison (Do they even have a prison in Soganlik?).  I should know, I used to live there!even some interest, most of us know what the holy grail is (Even if its just by watching Monty Python) However endless lectures about masons, science and various religious symbols in Browns usual condescending manner is just frankly boring.  A 500 page book that could quite easily have been 300.    Oh and by the way Dan.  Soganlik is a district of Kartal/Istanbul not just the name of a prison (Do they even have a prison in Soganlik?).

If you even associate yourself with liking metal, this is for you.
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|Lieutenant Aldo Rain leads a group called \\"The Basterds\\" with the prime goal to brutally kill or torture Nazis. This film is not quite th action you would expect, but it is great. The set-up scene at the beginning is a bit long, but absolutely necessary. This film is mostly in a foreign language, which was way more faithful to how the situation would actually go. Of course, this isn't based on a true story, but this fantasy war story succeeds at being one of the absolute best summer blockbusters.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Initially I found The Lost Symbol to be an enjoyable, fast paced novel.  I thought the subject was exciting.  However toward the last third of the book I found it tedious...so much religious justification that it became a tired lecture on the commonality and unification of all religions.  The discourse simply continued and continued...points driven in repeatedly until they became tired and repetitious.  I believe the last third of the novel could be removed and it would be much more enjoyable.  Frankly I am convinced that very few readers will seriously read the last third with any depth of understanding...they'll slide their eyes over those pages looking for the end of the novel.  I liked The Lost Symbol...glad I read it...but found it pedantic and boring a good measure of the time.

Now I know I have heard this statement since the world needs a hero but this time he is telling the truth.The new guitarist really did give megadeth there classic famous sound. It is unfair to say that this album is like any of the previous albums because that would be a lie. To me this album would have been a great follow up to rust in peace. so turn it to 11 and bang your head like it's 1990 again!

B0002F6AH0|5.0|I saw this series during the 1970s and recorded via VHS tapes because it had no peer about the detailed coverage of World War II. It overcomes being in black and white because of the in-depth coverage of the war, narration by Laurence Olivier, and the production of the film.    I teach American history and purchased the DVD to use in a prolonged study of World War II. Several segments have been previewed by selected students and has received high ratings from the \\"color\\" generation.     \\"World At War\\" will appeal to novice or expert about World War II and probably the well-versed person might take more away from the series than the novice.

0316066524|4.0|I picked Infinite Jest up for the first time a few weeks after it was published in 1996, made it about a third of the way through, and then, concluding that it was just another pretentious, overly-written book demanding more in effort than it gave in reward, I set it aside, and in fact not long after gave it away.  Having parted ways with Mr. Wallace on that note, that should have been it.  But something about Wallace's style, coupled with his sardonic take on the world, coupled with his sheer elephantine ambition, caused me to keep going back to him.  I read \\"Girl With Curious Hair,\\" was mildly impressed with it, went back to Infinite Jest, and again floudered less than halfway through it. I read \\"A Supposedly Fun Thing...\\" was very impressed, picked up Infinited Jest a third time, and once more crashed and burned. And so it went, with me bouncing back and forth over the years between Wallace's short pieces of fiction and nonfiction and his long convoluted novel.     The truth is, I still haven't read this book all the way through from first page to last, although I'm fairly sure I've read the entire thing (and much of it more than once) in large chunks and pieces.  And maybe that's as good a way of reading it as any.  After all, it doesn't seem that DFW ever intended Infinite Jest to be read as a novel in the traditional sense of the word, not with its one-hundred-plus pages of footnotes tacked on the end and its countless sub-plots and circular digressions that run on for dozens of small print pages at a stretch.  In fact, it seems to me that Wallace did virtually everything in his power to hinder a straight-forward reading of his book, as if almost daring the reader to try and get through it without interruption, as one might get through, say, \\"David Copperfield\\" or \\"Middlemarch.\\"  None of this is to suggest that Infinite Jest isn't greater than the sum of its parts. It clearly is.  But it does seem to me that by book's end, Wallace was still struggling to finda format big enough to contain his considerable genius, and Infinite Jest, for all its much commented on size and daring, wasn't quite it.    Of course all of the above is mere speculation, and with Wallace dead now we'll never really know for sure what his still evolving view of literature actually was, or where his talent might ultimately have taken him.  But while Wallace may be gone, we do have his weird creation, Infinite Jest, a book that, no matter how you read it (straight through or in drips and drabs), has an abundance of great set pieces, sly witticisms, clever turns of phrase, and some of the most crazy, paranoid characters this side of Pynchonland.

B001FB55HQ|3.0|Now I will start off by saying that I agree with Cameron that the series should have ended with T2.  I didn't and we have T3: RISE OF THE MACHINES and the immortal line \\"Talk to the hand.\\"  TERMINATOR: SALVATION makes a better fit in that it takes us onward in time instead of having endless Terminators come back in time to save/kill John Connor.  It has a serviceable performance by Bale as John Connor.  Moon Bloodgood and Sam Worthington (actually a contender for James Bond) are worth the price of admission.  The CG Arnie (the head on the body of Roland Kickenger -- who is not going to be Conan) looks fake.  A popcorn film and nothing more.  If you are looking for TERIMATOR or T2 you will be disappointed.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|The biggest mistake I made, was reading all of the books in about a week and a half, then immediately trying to watch True Blood. I fell in love with the books, and when I started watching the TV series, it seemed they did nothing right. To me Anna Paquin was a horrible Sookie, Moyer was too old to be Bill, Tara was suddenly a core character and her race was changed. I could go on and on. I only watched the first episode, claiming the show to be horrid and not watching any further.    After a few months of everyone claiming how wonderful this show was I decided maybe I should give it another shot. I just had to tell myself to separate the books from the show. I had to look at it as just a show and nothing more. I have to say that does work to a point.    The story of Sookie, the mind reading waitress, and her love affair with mainstream Vamp Bill Compton takes place in the small Louisiana town of Bon Temps. Vampires are discriminated against in every way and are not very welcome in society. Soon several murders of local girls who were \\"vampire friendly\\" catch the attention of the local police. Evidence suggests Sookie's older and wild boy brother is the culprit. Sookie soon realizes everything is not as it seems and is introduced to the harsh life of vampire politics, and a murderer gunning for her.    Spoilers:    Though I did try to separate the two, there were still things that made me cringe. While there were others that made me smile, and I was actually happy they changed. Lafayette's role was increased from a few lines in the book to a colorful, funny, supporting character. The character of Sookie is one of the things that was the hardest to accept. her character is rather different than the one introduced to us in the book. The one in the show seems crankier, needier, and perhaps more depressing than the Sookie from the books. She doesn't get to narrate the show, and we are left without her sense of humor and her ability to take things in stride.It was disappointing to suddenly find out Rene was the killer in just the last two episodes.    It is an enjoyable show overall. There are many sex scenes and lots of nudity throughout. The language is very strong and the character of Tara is one that loves to spout off. Sometimes the shots of Bill trying to drink from Sookie seemed a tad corny. The liberties taken with the plot sometimes work in the shows favor. Afterall, they have 12 hours of story to put on the air, something a 300 page book would have trouble doing. Jason having his own story of addiction and convincing himself that perhaps he is a killer was one I enjoyed being introduced. He was a much more likable character than he was in the books. The casting was somewhat hit and miss to me. I feel the best two casted characters were Lafayette and Pam. It was nice to see Pam dressed as a soccer mom as she does in the books. The one thing I do not want changed is the triangle of Bill Sookie and Eric. Moreover, the character of Eric from the books. Here's to hoping they don't make him the evil seducer and Bill the white shining knight.    I have yet to watch season two, but I am excited to see how it goes. As I said before to fans of the book, don't expect this to be like the series.
0385504225|2.0|This book was a complete let-down for me. After Da Vinci code, I was expecting a richly detailed plot instead I got  lots of pseudo-religious symbolism and a completely obvious plot. This was the first Dan Brown book that  I could have done without. I guess success makes people lazy.    Don't buy this book, just check it out from your local library.
B002DKGWSE|1.0|Admittedly the camera work, the acting, the cast, and perhaps even the directing have the original beat by miles. This isn't the product of a first time director and crew working out of pocket to make what could be considered a landmark film in the genre, perhaps even creating the genre. This is a more reasonably budgeted Hollywood film with an experienced director, cast and film crew. But after that it falls flat in comparison to the original in just about every way imaginable. Since this film never had a hope of having the same shock impact the 1972 original had on audiences of the day it never even tries. The story is slightly altered, the characters generally are younger, and perhaps less insane, it streamlines a lot of things, we have less time to get to know the Collingwood's and Krug and his people before the action starts. While the bad guys get theirs and deservedly, for the most part the actually moments of revenge are tamer than the original, Francis's death in the original is a classic moment of shock that should have every guy in the audience wincing, and while his death in the remake is suitably unpleasant it never comes close. The only point in which the remake might be considered to surpass the original happens in the last minute and a half or so, a scene well hinted at in the trailers and commercials, showing Krug's fate. But even then it might not be as satisfying as the original. One admitted improvement in the remake is the complete removal of the ineffectual comedy relief police who are stumbling around trying to solve a crime they are barely even aware of. But ultimately this is a pretty mediocre copy of the original, and it has been done so much better in other films, including the original. The film Otis handles the same basic concept with a blackly humorous take that shows the true horror of the original far better than this film does. The unrated edition is also one of the biggest let downs ever, there's maybe 30 seconds of additional film.There's almost no difference at all to the two most graphic and shocking scenes in the film. This film will work best for people who haven't seen the original, in which case I'd give it a three star rating, but having seen the original and understood some of how it would have played to its original audiences this remake comes across as pretty pale. There's also no real extras to speak of, a 2 minute making of that does next to nothing except show Wes Craven giving his approval to a remake, and a couple deleted scenes.
0439813786|5.0|This book was suggested to me by a fellow Fourth Grade teacher. I was discouraged by the size of the book and thought my students would not be interested in such a thick book. I borrowed it from her anyway and started reading it and COULD NOT put it down. There are many pages with pictures and it makes the story so much better. I plan to read it aloud to my class and HIGHLY encourage kids and adults alike to check it out!!
045122499X|3.0|Interesting history, adequate writing. But the characters were reruns of Pillars of the Earth. And the editing was poor. It made a very long book longer.
0385504225|3.0|Not as good as Angels & Demons (my fave of his books).  Not as good as Da Vinci code.  It is full of interesting facts and connections across science, philosphy, art and religion of which I was not aware.  I was reading quickly and turning those pages swiftly at the beginning but the find a clue, figure it out, run and hide from the baddies, rinse then repeat sequence got old after a while.  The weakest part of the book for me was the \\"international crisis\\" once it was revealed.  I think I'll reread Angels & Demons.  P.S.  Readers of a previous Dan Brown novel must check our Rosslyn Chapel if in/near Edinburgh, Scotland.  Very worth it in its own right but with added interest and notoriety due to the book, which I won't name.
0385504225|2.0|I was very excited for this book - even ordered it for my mother so we could read it together... I was very dissapointed overall. The book was entertaining on the surface ... and that is about all I have good to say about it. The previous Langdon novels were GREAT - this one fell short. Overall it was more of the same + some National Treasure ... If you have read the previous Langdon books, stick to them. If you are picking this book up as your first Dan Brown book then you may find it new and page turning. Overall - EH.
1416550534|5.0|For me, this was on of the best novels I have read in some time. In order to truly like this book, you must enjoy a good story. Good stories aren't always filled with suspense and drama. The ending is a wonderful one but sometimes to enjoy the end you must know the beginning. The majority of the book is allowing you to get to know the characters, their relationships, and this is what makes the ending so emotional & satisfying. This is a spectacular debut from a new author who is able to allow us to see the past through the memories of an older woman. We see life through the eyes of a service girl dedicated to the lady she works for. A girl who kept a secret her entire life and finally shares it with the reader. It's been a long time since I felt such emotion after finishing a book.

B002GZQYMA|5.0|A lot of albums I've heard this year from bands I really enjoy have been albums I had to adjust too. For instance, the new Matisyahu album was completely different from 'Youth' and it took a few listens before I really began to like it. This album just seemed to flow really well from beginning to end. It's a bit different from previous Muse albums, but it has a lot of soul to it.<br /><br />The album is setup where it starts off more rockish and ends on a more near-instrumental note, with long piano ballads and softer singing. But again, it's the flow that makes this sound acceptable. Matthew's voice is the same, which I've noticed more and more bands adjusting their voices to 'better suit the music'. I've always found his voice to be perfect for this music anyway.<br /><br />I can say this is already one of my favorite Muse albums. Maybe it's my love for Muse, or maybe it's my wanting for an uprising in my country to stop crappy government and enjoy freedoms again. Maybe it's just both.

B001GCUO16|5.0|I just have to say that I will never listen to critics EVER again.  I based my decision to not catch Wolverine in theatres solely on what I was reading online and how bad this film was reported as being.  I now regret that decision after deciding to purchase the blu ray. I just finished watching it and I actually thought it was fantastic. I'm not an X-Men expert by any stretch of the imagination so I am not able to offer any comparisons from this movie to it's original comic book source material. Strictly from a cinematic/entertainment standpoint, this movie succeeded  on every level for me. Great story (from my point of view), great characters, great action sequences and special effects. It's just loads of fun to watch and I hope they continue with the Origins series. Never again will I trust critics or even what I hear from family and friends. It's always best to make your own decisions because you never know when you could be missing out on a highly entertaining \\"movie theatre\\" experience.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is an immediately addictive TV show. I didn't know about it until after the first season had aired, so I watched it on my portable DVD player in my bed. Personally, I prefer this because this way, you don't have to wait a whole week to find out what happens next, except of course for the last episode. The situation is interesting: Meredeth is handed the (seemingly) perfect guy, but doesn't want him. Add the other interns (George, Alex, Izzy, Christina) and doctors (Shepard, Burke, Bailey, Weber) and intricate workings of the hospital and you get a great mix. Sometimes is makes you mad, but the characters are realistic and well-balanced. This season only has 9 episodes so you can decide if you like the show or not. Overall, I would reccomend it.[[ASIN:B000FIMG5Y Grey's Anatomy - The Complete Second Season]] [[ASIN:B000P6YNSO Grey's Anatomy - The Complete Third Season]] [[ASIN:B0018CWEXK Grey's Anatomy: The Complete Fourth Season]] [[ASIN:B001VPJZ0O Grey's Anatomy: The Complete Fifth Season]]

032147404X|5.0|This book was a great help with lots of tips.  It is very easy to read; I kept it in the car for when I was waiting somewhere and it was very easy to read here and there and still get very valuable information.  Great tips, nice photos, great suggestions on equipment without being a \\"sales pitch\\".  I would recommend this book for anyone looking to improve their digital photos.
0670034711|2.0|I read this book with interest.  I am a researcher who studies human behavior and I am an American living in France married to a German.  I thought this book might represent something other than a self-involved and superficial treatment of traveling, learning, and discovery.  But I was largely wrong.  While I thought that there was some small insight that was generalizable (for instance, the author learns that no country is perfect and that people coming to it, perhaps especially ex-pats, tend to have simplistic, almost roller-coaster relationships to that country and to their home country), there was very little that didn't simply perpetuate stereotypes.  I think we have now read for years about individuals in special financial circumstances residing in a country within their special bubble and all it provides.  And these circumstances (represented by Adam Gopnik -- I am afraid --  Peter Mayle .. Frances Mayes) we see one version of another country.  We see how people with money or a protected salary from somewhere else live in an environment and we see how people in that environment treat these very select people.  That is all we learn.  Sometimes these bubble-like circumstances can be made interesting or insightful, but simply \\"this is my life, look what I ate and did\\" does not make for a good read.  I worry that books like this do nothing but stunt the possibility for improvement in international relations and cultural insight.  My father was a theologian and so I also thought I might see insight about religion here, but Gilbert's religion also seems very self-involved.  Unfortunately, in this book we don't come to care very much about her struggle and we do not learn that religion can take people away from a focus on their own struggles to a focus on those of others.  Even paying for someone's house seems to be motivated by the author's needs and not about compassion.  So, in the end, I was disappointed.
B00005RIKD|5.0|On the saddest day I have ever lived through, Sting took the stage and turned this live concert into a tribute, a memorial and a heart felt personal message to a world that had just suffered through the 9/11 disaster...Music and Musicians were tremendous...the DVD of this concert is wonderful as well..
B0025KVLU6|3.0|The White Album is not really an album.  It has more of the feel of a compilation than a coherent set of songs.  People who know the history of the band know that the months during which the White Album was recorded were the first months during which the cracks and fissures in the band really started to show in public.  Well, those cracks really showed on this album too.  Gone was the cohesiveness that marked their previous four studio releases - Help!, Rubber Soul, Revolver, and Sgt. Pepper's.  The quality of the individual songs themselves was also noticeably lower than in Sgt. Pepper's and Revolver.    Which brings me to the remaster.  I admit, there is some ear candy in this release.  \\"Blackbird\\" sounds a lot crisper, the instruments in \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" come through more clearly, and you can hear the strums on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" better than ever.  Of course, the downside is that you can also hear Yoko's fingernails-on-the-chalkboard voice in \\"Bungalow Bill\\" more clearly, and I realized that no, there really is no saving grace for that song.  The cacophony of \\"Helter Skelter\\" is no more intelligible, and the weakness of \\"I Will\\" compared to the band's earlier love songs is clearer than ever.  I'm sure some will disagree, but crisper sounds can't make this album into anything more than it was - a disappointing step down from the band's previous releases.    If you buy this as part of the box set, I won't criticize.  But if you spend money to buy it on its own, it is not money well spent.  Sound quality is not what was missing from this album.
B000001Y2U|5.0|The best. Manson\\"s Antichrist Superstar is the one album that made him. It's the one that pissed off a lot of useless religion groups. The other albums are great, but this is the most popular. If you're a true Manson fan then you should have this in cd in your collection.
0385504225|3.0|When I heard that Dan Brown's latest book would revolve around the secrets of the Masons, I was mildly disappointed.  With the release of the movie, \\"National Treasure\\", I was afraid there would be too many similarities that would dampen the excitement of the storyline.    However, once I started reading The Lost Symbol, I realized that my disappointment didn't lie within the story of the Masons.  It was solely due to the storyline's structure.  It felt like a retread of The Da Vinci Code, with bits and pieces of Angels & Demons peppered throughout.     Granted, most writers follow a standard construction that allows the reader to develop and maintain a connection with the main character that stretches from book to book (in this case, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon).  Yet Dan Brown's latest effort seemed too familiar - as if he was afraid to stray from previous outlines.     On the bright side, I love the interlacing of fact and fiction when it comes to historical art and architecture.  Dan Brown delivers once again - this time enlightening readers of the magnificent buildings that grace our nation's capital.  I wouldn't be surprised to see a boost in tourism in Washington D.C. due to his brilliant descriptions and mystical overtones.    If only the storyline was as good as the imagery.  Maybe Dan Brown's motto was, \\"You can't have too much of a good thing\\".     But in this case, I think you can.

0385341008|4.0|This epistolary novel is set in 1946 England, where Juliet Ashton, well known for her humorous journalistic work during the war, is looking for a new subject to write about. When she receives a letter from a man who now owns a book that used to belong to Juliet obtained through the \\"Literary Society\\" on Guernsey Island, she establishes a communication with him and other Guernseyans, one that will not only give her a new subject for writing but a new direction for her life.<br /><br /> Once Juliet begins corresponding with the islanders, at first about books and then at length about their experiences during the war (the Channel Islands were occupied by Germans in WWII), she finds herself drawn into the island's place in history and then to the island itself. Leaving London and a rather insistent American suitor behind, Juliet visits Guernsey and finds herself enchanted and intrigued by the familiar pen pals she can at last put faces to. As her letters back and forth to her friends and publisher reveal, Juliet finds her new subject and discovers the true depths of joy and sorrow in the stories of Guernsey's inhabitants.<br /><br /> Shaffer and Barrows have done a lovely job of giving voice to several wonderful characters within the 'letters' format. The varied points of view are handled well and although one can see the ending coming a long way off, it's still satisfying when Juliet arrives just where she ought to. As a bonus, I learned a great deal about the German occupation of Guernsey, something about which I must confess I knew next to nothing until now. It's just not covered in American history, I suppose.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I agree with all of the reviews I have read, on this new, interesting, entertaining weekly show. I did not actually start watching it, until maybe the last 4 episodes. I found the show to be addictive after the first time I watched it, and have not missed an episode since then.        I do not think it is ONE of the best on T.V., I think it IS the BEST. So, for the first time ever, I have actually ordered the DVD containing the entire first season as well as bonus material. I will be anxious to get it, so I can catch up on all the episodes I missed, before I realized such a good series was currently on T.V.       As others have said, the cast was chosen very well, and each member is perfect for the part they play in the show. The chemistry between the main characters, and the way they proceed using different methods in solving cases is most entertaining. All of the supporting actors play their parts really well also. This is really fine entertainment at it's best.
B000005IU2|4.0|I'm reviewing the version of this cd which I got in a \\"2 in 1\\" with \\"The Stooges\\".  The sound quality is excellent. Like I said in my header,  the first side of this album (were it on vinyl) would be straight up Stooges. The second side, starting from the song \\"1970\\" is more band jam or jazz rock or noise rock, depending on your view. It's this change in tone which makes judging this album difficult. If you were to take a cynical view, you could view the band as having running out of material to make a full album, so they just 'padded' it out with 'filler' of a non-descript sort. I didn't mind the second half of the album, which is not to say that others won't hate it.  So, I think that album would have a 'natural' scoring range of anywhere between 5 out of 10 to maybe up to 7.5 out of 10, depending on your disposition. Just by the by, I make a note of a couple of songs sort of having a drug related sound to them...those songs are: (at the start) \\"Dirt\\",  \\"1970\\" (sort of at the end of that track) and \\"L.A.Blues\\", if I am reading my notes correctly. Dunno...to me it sort of sounds like a bong sound!      Best song:      Dirt - coming in at around 7 minutes, this is a slower, bluesy song with a keyboard intro. It's smooth sounding, with a bassy  riff. There is also some pretty guitar playing...sort of Dire Straitsy lead guitar work, sometimes. There are also some nice changes in tone.      Next best song:      T.V.Eye - a garage rock type guitar sound comes only from the left channel. On the right channel, the drums are dominant, but not exclusively there. The guitar definitely has a 'punk' quality to it, and it also reminds me, somewhat, to the atmosphere evoked in their debut album song \\"I wanna be your dog\\". Bass guitar sounds rich in this song.  Iggy demonstrates a sense of theatre with his screeching on this song.  My first contact with this song was via Australian punk pioneers Radio Birdman's version in their debut album \\"Radios appear\\". Their version is more energetic.  I'll mention this Aussie band for the song below, too.      Best of the rest:      1970 -   a jumping, bluesy rock song, with a bassy sound...running bass. Not sure if Aussie band Radio Birdman misheard the lyrics in this song (like I initially did, but having being 'primed' to hear it, maybe, due to listening to them a short time before I heard The Stooges for the first time), which goes \\"Radio burnin', up above\\".  Anyway, \\"Radio Birdman\\" sounds a cooler band name than \\"Radio burnin'\\", right?  When I review Radios Appear, I'll mention when that band name drops bands like The Stooges in one of their songs. ANYWAY, this is the track which marks the right angled turn into jazz rock/noise rock.  The song is quite catchy until this change of direction, which features a jazzy saxophone outro. The song definitely has a groove to it though.      The rest:      Down on the street - a mid-tempo blues rock song opens the album. Has an interesting drum pattern and some fuzz rock guitar. The guitars have a 'proto-punk' sound to them.  This song also has a quiet/loud/quiet structure, which is the structure which alternative rock group Pixies would later be identified with. Song features bass and guitar solo. Iggy's voice reminds me of Aussie Tex Perkins in this song (especially his band The Cruel Sea).    Loose - another track with a proto-punk guitar sound. Song is garage rock, with a punkish sounding rhythm guitar, bass guitar, and a whiny sounding lead guitar.        The other jazz rock/noise rock songs:        Fun house - comes in at a long 7:46 minutes. The intro reminds me of The Doors' \\"Roadhouse blues\\" (their debut album also had echoes of The Doors in it...see my recent review for more details). Perhaps you could describe this song as a continuation of the jazz rock outro from the previous song, \\"1970\\".  Both feature the sax, and the early lyrics to this song also make that connection. A bassy track. 3:49 into this song, there is some distortion. Iggy'soccasionally screeching vocal style is also an echo of The Doors' Jim Morrison's foray into this vocal technique. Anyway, when The Stooges do 'jam' on this album, they always play tight.     L.A. Blues - in my notes I write \\"jazz rock (?)\\". Maybe it's a jam...money for jam.  Saxophone again adds unity to the second half of this album's style. Iggy again screeches in this song. It sounds like two sets of drummers are used in this song.        Recommendations:        Radio Birdman: Radios appear.  A recent critics/industry poll voted this one of the top 10 Australian albums of all time.    Captain Beefheart: Trout mask replica.   Not exactly a favourite album of mine, but it does go further down the 'experimental/jazzy' route than The Stooges do here. Critics love it.

B000002G7G|5.0|Having recently decided to check out this band's work despite never hearing them before (sure, I'd heard OF them, but they never get played on commercial radio here in Australia), I found myself likening lead singer Lou Reed's style and lyrics to Bob Dylan's...but better. Dylan's lyrics often button-holed you when you would rather let them wash over you...like in his worst excesses on \\"Blood on the tracks\\" (which I go into in a review at this site). Personally, I find this album to be better than Dylan's \\"Blood on the tracks\\", as it has none of the guff of that latter album. Both albums are pleasingly mellow though. The Velvet's 3rd album is a return to the atmosphere of their first album, after taking a right-angled turn for their second album, which proved less effective, in my view (as I state in my review of that here, recently). Listening to their self-titled third album, about mid-way through it I was thinking it was probably just as good as their debut, but I was looking at marking it down, because their debut had 'been there, done that' first. One song changed that and made me give this album a perfect score:      Their greatest song:      The murder mystery - coming in at an epic 8:56 minutes in length, this is perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing example of 'experimental' music I've ever heard (granted, my repertoire is small!).  A while back I reviewed a Moldy Peaches album and was particularly taken with one song, which had duelling vocals. Perhaps this Velvet's song is the first of its kind in modern music and maybe inspired the Moldy Peaches.  Musically, it featured a catchy guitar for the low-end sounds, as well as an organ. The last two minutes of this song has a different character...features the piano. Honestly, this is a song I could have still gladly embraced had it been twice the length, which is rare for me to say. In fact, they should re-record this with double the length! The duelling vocals perhaps bury some unpleasant lyrics, but that doesn't detract from the majesty of this song. On their second album, \\"Lady Godiva's operation\\" puts those 'off' lyrics front and centre, which maybe marks that song down in my estimation. On this song, they do everything right.      The next best songs:      What goes on - uptempo track, with dual guitars, which sound 'jaunty' later. Organ also features, and that instrument, as well as the vocals prove a bit catchy.  The ending to the song seems to feature brush drum sticks, which perhaps swoosh side to side, jazz style.    Pale blue eyes - a very mellow, and soothing track, which is why I like this kind of stuff and rate their albums highly, despite them not have classically 'great' songs, which you get in Classic Pop/Rock.  Dual guitars feature again, picking notes.  Think I hear a tambourine playing in this.  The guitar notes are vaguely like \\"In my life\\" by The Beatles.    Jesus - dual lead guitar note picking, again. Dual vocal harmonies too. One lead guitar has a melody which reminded me of \\"Day after day\\", I think (Google tells me that this is a Badfinger song). Since V.U has often mixed easy listening, mellow music with slightly dodgy lyrics, perhaps this song was an attempt to appeal to a more mainstream, Christian audience?      On second listen, this was also a good song:      Beginning to see the light - a folk rocky, jaunty song with catchy guitar and vocals. Dylanesque, with some of Dylan's trademark quirks, like laughing at his own lyrics. As I found this song catchier the second time around (it's probably the second best song on the album, now), I get the feeling that this is the shadow of a great pop song...maybe the band couldn't, or wouldn't search harder to find that pop gem.      The rest:      Candy says - a pleasant, mellow dual guitar note picking song, with a soft brush drum beat. Interesting lyrics, and the first song on this album (literally) to have a touch of \\"In my life\\" by The Beatles about it.    Some kinda love - dual lead guitars, with a little country style twang to them. Has a deep beat to it as well as a Knights Of Nee beat to it.    I'm set free - pleasant, ethereal dual lead guitars. Notable drum patterns, which I quite liked. For some reasons I've joined a line between this song and \\"Jesus\\"...not sure why now. Because I like the drumming? Oh well.    That's the story of my life - another mellow track. Sounds like the drummer is using glass lids or something for percussion. Interesting. Oddly, when you press \\"back\\" to re-listen to the start of this song, you miss the first three seconds and some lyrics. Not sure why that would be...it doesn't happen when you press \\"forward\\" from the previous track...where you get the full song. Hmmm.    After hours - a Moldy Peaches sounding song, as far as the female vocals go (of course, they came after V.U, but I heard them first). A pleasant song in any case. Features a tuba, I think, which does sound distorted on this track.      Recommendations:      The Velvet Underground & Nico    The Moldy Peaches    The Dandy Warhol's \\"Thirteen  tales\\" and \\"Come down\\"    Radio Birdman \\"Radios appear\\". An Australian punk band, but they have some jazzy, pleasant sounding tracks on that album.    Television \\"Marquee moon\\". Called a punk band for some reason, this album is easy listening and features dual guitars too. Not a favourite album of mine, but some might like it a lot more than me...critics love it.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|I had previously read Gone Baby Gone so I was acquainted with Lehane's style.  This dark book started out good and as time went by I actually felt myself questioning my own ability to determine what was actually happening in the story.  I found that I wanted so much to believe the protagonist.  I wanted to be able to count on his observations of his surroundings and the characters he interacted with in the story.  As the hairs began to stand up on the back of my neck I knew that what was happening was not what I wanted.<br /><br />The only reason I gave four instead of five stars is because I did not like the book.  The descriptions of a brutal act shook me to the core.  I like to like my protagonist and basically could not say that I liked anyone in this story.  This is one wild wild ride.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I consider myself pretty fit and healthy, with regular trips to the gym for cardio and weights and yoga/pilates thrown in. However, I have never worked this hard! I started at level 1 and worked to level 3. Each level really is tougher than the last. By the end of each I am pouring with sweat. Sometimes for variety I switch to \\"Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism\\" and do a bunch of circuits or if I have time, the whole 40 minutes. I am still using \\"30 Day\\" but mixing it up by doing level one but using weights during the cardio circuits, or doing the tougher versions of the moves that I learned from level three. What I love about this workouts is that I can do them at home with just a mat and handweights and get it done quickly! It is my morning ritual before work. I am definitely more toned and have better ab definition. My husband loves it.  For the best results shoot for 5X per week.
B00000I41J|1.0|This is a MONO recording !<br /><br />UPC 2434953292 shows EMI Music Distribution recording mode as STEREO, however RVG's Edition is remastered in MONO but not mentioned on the packaging. This recording presents a narrow sound stage with instruments on top of one another. I have some very well mastered &#34;MONO&#34; recordings so I'm not obsessed with hearing different instruments from different speakers. I like to listen and appreciate what audio engineers were able to record. On this purchase, I thought I was buying a stereo recording. After first listen, I felt cheated. It was a waste of money and now I have to buy the original Blue Note release.<br /><br />Please don't buy into the hype about RVG's 24 bit analog to digital transfers because their results are borderline amateurish, like someone was messing around with their laptop software while playing online poker. This is not the only landmark recording RVG has ruined. Kenny Burrell's &#34;Midnight Blue&#34; and the list goes on. I avoid RVG like the black plague of the re-master scam.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|If you like outlaw bikers, or the myth behind their image.....or, if you loved the Sopranos, then you will definitely enjoy this exciting crime-drama. Based in a small fictional town in California, the series centers around a fictional international 1%er outlaw biker gang called the Sons of Anarchy (which is a really cool name, I think) and their everyday activities, both normal and criminal. The acting is superb on all levels, and the individual episodes build upon one another until the very exciting finale. I don't want to give anything away, but its worth watching. Season Two just started on FX, and its shaping up to be just as good as the last one!
0385504225|1.0|I read The Lost Symbol on a dare by a friend.  It's not hyperbole when I say this is the worst book I've ever read.  The main character, Robert Langdon, is whiny, annoying, and willfully stupid; the supporting characters are one-dimensional; the plot is completely implausible; and the writing is worse than I expected.        Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.      On the plus side, it took me all of 5 hours to read the 500+ pages.  However, those 5 hours were filled with self-loathing and regret.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I first saw Dirty Dancing when I was about seven years old. My cousins would come over and bring their recorded-from-tv VHS tape and we'd watch and dance around together. Nostalgia is a big reason for my adoration of this film.<br /><br />Baby Houseman (Jennifer Grey) goes to a summer resort with her family just after graduating from high school. She is an idealist who intends on joining the Peace Corps. While exploring the resort grounds, she spots one of the staff, a dancer named Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). He is a rebel, but someone who has been stepped on his whole life. Baby lucks into meeting him, and the two become unlikely dance partners when Johnny's real partner (Cynthia Rhodes) becomes pregnant and needs an abortion. Baby's attraction to Johnny is soon reciprocated and the two begin a forbidden romance.<br /><br />The music is vital to the film, and without it, it wouldn't have a fraction of its fans. Of course, \\"Time of My Life\\" won an Oscar and is the most memorable. Swayze sings \\"She's Like the Wind\\" which provides additional emotion to an important scene. Also included are \\"Hungry Eyes,\\" \\"Love is Strange,\\" and \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\\"<br /><br />Men will dislike this movie, or at least feel a need to publically renounce it, but women will eat up every moment. It never loses its spark.
B002OPYUSM|4.0|The pilot episode of \\"Community\\" holds a lot of promise for an intelligent and witty sitcom. No spoilers from me; the show centers on Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), a fast talking lawyer who has been suspended by the State Bar for not having a real degree. This first episode introduces all of the major characters and through a clever plot device gives us some of their background biographies as well.<br /><br />I was somewhat surprised to find Chevy Chase playing Pierce, an older student with a poor understanding of modern rules of behavior towards women. This could be an interesting character if allowed to develop.<br /><br />Hopefully the rest of the season will be as good as this one.
0385504225|4.0|I enjoyed the book. I have a hard time reading books that are scientific and lots of detail. I couldnt make it through Angels and Demons but I loved Da Vinci Code. I don't remember the last time it took me 3 days to read a book! But, in the end, I did enjoy it and will suggest it to many people, as I am a librarian and people ask me!
0061537934|2.0|Predictable and a sappy tear-jerker. I must admit I didn't get past 100 pages because that's all I could take. Many unbelievable pieces to the story and the ongoing relation to auto-racing was just annoying. The wife has horrible black-out headaches, is losing weight, and violently ill but just can't get herself to the doctor? All set up to make the following terrible illness more corny. If you loved the Notebook and it's sap, you'll love this drivel.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I had planned a trip for the weekend after The Lost Symbol came out so enjoyed spending time on the airplane, at the pool, and waiting at the airport reading Brown's latest conspiracy adventure.  It was a good read, but certainly not a book I'll probably look to read again.      Brown mixes reference to real art and real organizations with a vast array of conspiracy theories and loses the reader in a chasm between reality and fiction, as good fiction should.  The level of detail that Brown includes in his books shows immense research on the author's part - leaving this reader impressed.
0441013597|5.0|Quite possibly the greatest book I've ever read! I absolutely loved it and can't get enough of Dune now. I've already ripped through Dune Messiah (which I enjoyed just as much) and I'm half way through Children of Dune. I'm loving Dune....
0385504225|3.0|I am an enormous fan of DV Code and thought Angels and Demons was very good.  Read his others and thought ok; Lost Symbol was a big let down after he spent so many years getting this out.  My advice, read it from your local library, wait for paperback, or read electronically....not worth buying hardcover--this was good but not great.  Ending was letdown as was most of the progression of the book.
0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol continues the adventures of Robert Langdon, Harvard Professor of Symbology, a genius with an eidetic memory whose peculiar ability to interpret symbols lands him in hot water more often than his job description would lead you to suspect. This time around Langdon is summoned to Washington D.C. by an old friend, Peter Solomon, who asks him at the last minute to give a talk in the Capitol's Statuary Hall. Needless to say, the trip doesn't go as planned, and Langdon finds himself plunged into yet another crisis, this one brought on by a religious crazy with a thing for tattoos. Saving the world--or at least the United States--involves Langdon in a sort of treasure hunt that leads him to explore the Masonic underpinnings of the country and the Masonic imagery that decorates many of its monuments.<br /><br />I've enjoyed Dan Brown's books in the past because they are--or have been--page-turners. The DaVinci Code, for example, starts with an exciting scene, as a killer chases the curator of the Louvre through the museum. Strangely--unfortunately--The Lost Symbol is very slow to get going. The action doesn't begin in earnest until about a third of the way in. Instead, there's a lot of exposition--Langdon explaining the significance of this or that symbol. When things do finally get moving the story moves quickly, though it's still periodically slowed by further explanatory passages. Similarly, the final ten percent or so of the book is extremely dull, the surviving characters blathering on about religion with the unwelcome fervor of evangelical door-knockers. This 50-odd pages of boring (mostly) dialogue is tacked on after the dramatic stuff is over, which is to say that it's close to completely unnecessary to the story. It's also hard to believe, after everything the characters have been through by this point, that they'd opt to tour some Washington landmarks and lecture one another about religion and science instead of going home to nap. This part really should have been cut.<br /><br />A few other things bothered me about the book. In no particular order:<br /><br />-- Inoue Sato, Director of the CIA's Office of Security, does not come off as a credible character. I also found it impossible not to picture her as the diminutive, accented seamstress in The Incredibles.<br /><br />-- Particularly in the first third of the book, the prose is interrupted frequently by the characters' italicized thoughts. Used more sparingly, this would have been fine, but it's overdone, the must mundane of thoughts sometimes meriting this kind of attention:<br /><br />\\"Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.<br /><br />\\"_I hope he's okay._\\"<br /><br />-- In addition to threatening the lives of Langdon's friends, the chaos planned by this book's bad guy also threatens national security, as we're frequently told. Hence the involvement of the CIA. But while the impending crisis might indeed have serious repercussions, it somehow fails to terrify. It's rather like threatening someone with a really bad splinter that will eventually become infected and might result in the loss of a limb. Worrisome, to be sure, but it doesn't get one's attention the way, say, the threat of a gouged-out eyeball would.<br /><br />-- For all his brilliance and his ability to make startling intellectual leaps, Langdon sometimes comes across as profoundly stubborn and rather slow. (I actually beat him in recognizing the meaning of one series of symbols near the book's end. This does not speak well for Robert.)<br />-- It was inevitable that some drama or other would play out in the pitch dark of pod 5 of the Smithsonian Museum Support Center, where Katherine Solomon, Peter Solomon's sister, has her lab. I thus understand why things had to be left dark for dramatic reasons, but for the life of me I can't imagine otherwise why the woman never invested in a flashlight.<br /><br />In short, a lot bothered me about the story, but the main problem is that it's a good hundred pages too long. Cut out the lectures so the book is action-packed right out of the gate and doesn't end with a whimper, and it would be a much better read, on a par with the author's earlier works.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamelhe story, but the main problem is that it's a good hundred pages too long.

B0025KVLRY|3.0|This is a fantastic album, 5 stars like every other Beatles album-- I don't think I have to tell you that.     But I just want to reiterate what others are saying about the 2009 stereo remastered mix... it's just plain awful to listen to, IMO, simply for the fact that all the vocals are in the right speaker. This problem also exists on the Please Please Me album. Outside of those two CDs, as well as some of the tracks from this period on the Past Masters 1 collection, all the new stereo releases are phenomenal and indispensable (well, I also think Sgt. Pepper is better in mono, but that's even an more subjective opinion).    Anyway, they did a tremendous job with the re-mastering, but \\"buyer beware\\" before you purchase With the Beatles or Please Please Me. Hopefully they will re-issue the mono versions of at least those two albums separately in the future.
0066620996|5.0|This was a great book to look at for figuring out how to create sustained excellence in an organization. The interesting thing to look at is how it has sustained itself over time. As someone else pointed out, some of the companies profile would not be considered \\"great\\" now. This fact just shows how much work it takes to continue to be great and how much work it takes to get there. Collins dose set about a simple step-by-step plan to use. He even provides a non-business example of how to sustain excellence at the end of the book for those who are just starting to excel in the management field instead of the more seasoned professionals.

B00005MP58|5.0|If you are going to buy a DVD of the Pride and Prejudice, this is the only one to get.  The movie closely follows the book, the places filmed and actors/actress that portray the characters in the book are excatly how I pictured them.  This DVD gives you a window into Jane Austin's world.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I believe this show won awards as well it should. Everyone should see this mini-series for the phenomonal acting of the actors and the historical account of a great man/men.  I loved the verbage, the  eloquent manner of speech even while arguing was a treat to the ears.
0688163173|5.0|This is the first Dennis Lehane book I've ever read. After seeing the trailer for the film, my husband bought the book, read it, then insisted I do the same. It was fantastic! I find the writing in many popular books to be lazy, but not this one. Dennis Lehane took a story that could have been very predictable, and made it not so. If you want a book that you cannot put down, this is it!
B002BIULQC|4.0|Not the fastest shipping I've ever experienced, but wow, what an amazing deal.  This was the first movie I've ever taken my 5 year old daughter to the theater to see, so it was really important to me to get it for her to have to watch at home, and when I saw the prices online, I couldn't believe them.  Yay internet!!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|In The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Lisbeth Salander electrified the story, even though she had a relatively small part in the plot; here, in the second novel of the series, she is given center stage to Blomkvist's secondary role, making The Girl Who Played With Fire much tauter, more exciting than the first book.  Larsson begins to expose what makes Salander tick, and the result gives her character an interesting vulnerability, one that makes her more human and less crazy.<br /><br />But let's get one thing straight;  even with the more humanizing portrait, you would not want to corner Salander in a dark alley.  Nor do you want to give her access to your computer.  She is every bit as gritty and clever as she was in the first, and her stark determination to live by her own moral code drives the plot.  When a journalist working for Blomkvist and Berger and his PhD candidate girlfriend are murdered, it's bad enough, but when those murders are linked to that of Salander's sadomasochistic guardian, Salander becomes the only suspect.  On the lam, she seems to make no attempt to clear her name and instead gets in deeper.  Throw in a \\"blond giant\\" (similar in many ways to the albino monk of The DaVinci Code), the seedy underpinnings of the sex trade, and returning characters, and you've got a suspenseful, likable, satisfying thriller.<br /><br />As a pure thriller, The Girl Who Played With Fire is stronger than its predecessor because it has fewer meandering subplots, more unrelenting suspense, and more deftly drawn characters, even if Larsson occasionally resorts to types.  The author seems to have found his  narrative stride with this.  If you liked the first, you'll love the second.  I just hope Larssen's third manuscript was polished enough before he passed away to build on his already finely-tuned skills as a novelist.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B0025KVLVA|5.0|Recently purchasing this \\"past masters remasters\\", was for one good reason the second volume contains most of the album, HEY JUDE, or also known as, BEATLES AGAIN, even though the original Apple vinyl sits tightly in my collection, ya gotta love the album cover,...I had already owned the old first volume of remasters and always thought the audio was excellent, the new sound is slightly better on this, more vital, especially the second volume, then again the songs are later recordings, where as the first vol. consist of earlier songs - \\"I Feel Fine\\", \\"From Me To You\\", plus two of McCartney's best rockers, \\"She's A Woman\\", and \\"I'm Down\\". The bottom line is this collection completes the Parlophone collection, songs missing on the studio pressings. If you already own vol.1, vol.2, you probably don't need this one, I think it's a great Beatles compilation showcasing the early tracks and later tracks like Lennon's, \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", \\"Rain\\", and  \\"The Ballad Of John And Yoko\\", gotta give this one five stars for the ultimate compilation and the superior hi-fi audio, would also recommend the new remastered, REVOLVER, - absolutely thunderous.

B0025KVLT2|2.0|First. . .5 stars for the original album, and 5 stars for the Beatles, of course.  I bought the remasters of \\"Help\\" and \\"Rubber Soul.\\"  Great albums, but the lopsided stereo is annoying.  The liner notes say, in very small print, they worked from the 1987 remaster.  No wonder the sound improvement is only slight.  Nice new booklet, however.

This is good recreational reading.  I don't read Brown looking for great writing and superior literature.    Something about the \\"moral\\" of the story stayed with me and made me think.  To me thats what a good book does.

0786860707|5.0|I first saw Disney's Pinnochio as a six year old, and it changed my life. It lead to a life-long love of art, animation, ecology, whales, and the sea.   As I grew older I was to learn that Pinnochio, along with Bambi, is regarded as among the very best, if not THE best of Disney animation. I have both these films on DVD, and any law abiding animation fan shouldn't be without them.   Nor should any animation nut be without this book. This is a most comprehensive, colourfully illustrated document of the why's and wherefore's of  Disney animation.   While it goes into considerable detail, it is strictly speaking not a manual as such.   It is more designed as an insight into the mysteries of animation for the lay person,  with more than enough to inspire and inform any potential animator. It covers the various aspects of the animation process, and the  history of Disney animation. It is accompanied by  ooddles, and oodles of full page colour photos, reproductions of animation sequences of famous Disney characters, diagrams, sections on each of the  main Disney animators, and  hilarious caricatures that animators did of each other.   This book is simply  a \\"must have\\" for any Disney animation fan, or any  animation fan period.    I am thrilled to have this book. It arrived in record time too, and well packaged.   Do yourself a favour, and get this.  You'e GOT  TO HAVE IT!                                            You won't be disappointed.

0385504225|2.0|While the book is a page-turner, I found the plot hard to swallow.  Furthermore, I noticed just how awkward of a writer Dan Brown seems to be.  He uses many phrases that one would almost expect to find in pulp fiction.  Characters are flat, and where they are developed, I was distracted by the writing style.  The New Age elements of the book really turned me off, early on, but I pressed on because the book was a page turner.  Unfortunately, with one exception (an unexpected plot twist toward the end), they payoff was disappointing.
0800141660|5.0|If you like period pieces and happy endings, this is the movie for you.  Sense and Sensibility has always been a favorite of mine.  The cast is wonderful and Alan Rickman as the gentle and lonely Colonel Brandon is one of his best roles.  Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant make for a lovely couple as Elenor and Edward.  Sense and Sensibility will make you laugh and cry.  A great movie!
0385504225|2.0|I read The Lost Symbol while sick at home over the weekend.  Had nothing else to do, so I had plenty of time to ponder the symbology, look up words I didn't understand, Google a few things -- basically, to have fun with the text.    What a snooze, and no, it wasn't from the cold medication.    I was absolutely bored by the book.  And the ending?  What ending?  Compared to his earlier works, the ending as about as anticlimactic as it gets.  I'm not expecting the ending the be a nice, neat little package perfectly tied up with a bow, but this was crap.    I know we are supposed to suspend our beliefs and, at times, reality when reading Brown's work.  That isn't a problem when the story is interesting.      Two stars.  One for the beautiful cover, and one because I finished it.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I was a little hesitant at first, but after purchasing this album I am glad I did.  It's one of the best albums of the year thus far!  Britney's new style is smoking.

Buy this album and you won't be disappointed!
B001MEJY8W|4.0|If the past few years have taught us anything, it's that you can never underestimate the French when it comes to delivering top-notch horror movies. Like \\"High Tension\\" and \\"Inside\\" before it, \\"Martyrs\\" is the latest film to be subjected to a wealth of internet hype and to gain significant notoriety in the states, especially for a foreign film. But as director Pascal Laugier states in his introduction on the DVD, the film was merely an experiment in cinema and subsequently will evoke a reaction in any viewer, whether it's a positive or a negative one.<br /><br />That's pretty much the story of \\"Martyrs,\\" a tricky film that is part revenge, part cerebral thriller. While it lacks the visceral punch of other films it's been compared to, the film is perhaps one of the most ambitious in recent years. In his film, Laugier shows many influences ranging from the works of Stanley Kubrick to even \\"Hellraiser\\" (a film which the director was briefly attached to remake recently), but integrates them all into a film that is unmistakably his own. Blatantly going out of his way to avoid typical film clich&eacute;s and over-done visual-effects, Laugier's film presents itself as bluntly and realistically as possible. The way the film is shot is very matter-of-fact, showing the extreme violence exactly as it is. The lack of stylization is a style all its own, giving the film its own unmistakable and dreadful atmosphere. All of this is driven home with intense performances from its two leads - Morjana Alaoui and Mylene Jampanoi -- who go a long way to invoke sympathy in the audience and establish a very human factor that is important to the film's credibility, especially when it reaches ridiculous heights in the third act.<br /><br />Where \\"Martyrs\\" is heavy on the violence and dread, its problems stem from its severe lack of focus. The film shifts gears very sharply in its final act, and the build-up that precedes it is nearly destroyed. The very visceral first two-thirds of the film seem to have been forsaken for an ending that will leave many scratching their heads, wondering what kind of film they just saw. The ending itself is bold and will incite conversation long after the credits have rolled, but doesn't really fit with the tone of the rest of the movie. To put it simply, \\"Martyrs\\" is two movies in one, and unfortunately, its final act doesn't do the film justice. Having said that, however, \\"Martyrs\\" is still a bold and very unique experience in film, one that any horror fan (or anyone in general) should see for themselves in order to develop their own opinion. This is truly one film that will be interpreted differently by everyone, and in spite of its obvious flaws, won't soon be forgotten.aken for an ending that will leave many scratching their heads, wondering what kind of film they just saw.

B002NHBNWW|5.0|The Vampire Diaries is based on Novels written by L.J. Smith, they were published in 1991, which was years before the famous Twilight Saga by Stephanie Meyer. I can understand how it can be comparable but its only the appearance of the main characters that may give you that impression. If you read the books (like I have) you will know the original story as the TV series was adapted and had to change a view things to fit on screen. I quite enjoy the story and the brand new series, I've waited awhile for it. I always wondered if they would make it come to life and they did! The story sets around Elena, whose parents passed away and tries to live her life as normal as she can. That is until she meets Stefan, whom she later finds that he is a vampire. He wears a ring that protects him from the sun. Stefan has come to Mystic Falls (Fell's Church in the book) to get to know Elena as she resembles his past love, Katherine (his maker). And of course, the story has obstacles through their love.... I recommend the book & series!!!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I do enjoy Blu-ray. I also enjoy DVD. I NEVER use a digital copy, as I don't have an I-anything and the idea of watching a high def on a screen smaller than 32 inches makes no sense to me. When I first saw this, I thought the description of his package being a four disc edition was a typo.     I LOVE the idea of packaging a Blu-ray and a regular DVD together in the same package, since I don't have Blu-ray in every room of my house and would like to watch a movie in a room other than the one my home entertainment system is in and I've been forced to buy two copies of the same movie to do so. HD DVD had the right idea by putting one of each on the two sides of the disc, but I'll take a separate DVD copy instead.     What I'm annoyed about is the practice of putting the extras on a separate disc, since one of the ideas behind Blu-ray was to put out a disc that could hold roughly three times the information a DVD could, so I find putting extras on a separate disc is nothing more than an excuse to jack the price up, as is the digital copy.    Since this is the way it is (and it's not confined to Disney, by the way), I will have to buy the four disc set because the three disc set is only offering the movie, extras, and the useless digital copy. I don't like it, but I love this movie and I love Pixar, so I'm willing to pay for it. I don't like it, but since I don't have a choice, there you go.
0743455967|2.0|I honestly can't say if \\"On Writing\\" has any valuable advice on writing (beyond the rule below), I have stopped reading it as of page 62 ([[ASIN:0743455967 On Writing]] paperback), the language and some content is just too offensive.  If you have any problems with movies or games that receive \\"R\\" or \\"M\\" ratings for language then you do not want to pick up this book, the language is that bad.  Any valuable advise it might have is lost because Mr. King doesn't follow the very first writing rule he points out: \\"[take] out the bad parts\\" (chapter 20), i.e. leave out the unnecessary and distracting.  If any other useful advice is present or forthcoming, it has been so buried in the puerile language as to be lost.    Before you buy, check out the hardback version's \\"Look Inside\\" option ([[ASIN:0684853523 On Writing]] hardback) for sample content and language.   Read the \\"Second Forward\\" (p 11), if that is offensive, proceed no further, it just gets worse.  If not, read p31 (the description in the last paragraph ch 9 and the language 1st paragraph ch 10) and then decide.     One further note, I did not read this book voluntarily, it is on my child's 9th grade English Honors class' required reading list.  It is definitely not appropriate for high school students.  If you care about your kids, read what they are suppose to read before they do.

B000FC10MU|1.0|I love Michael Chabon and I bought this book because the cover contained a supportive quip from Chabon.  I'm 100 pages in and I have found no compelling reason to be interested in the story or any of the characters.  It reads like the random wishful thinking of a 17 year old boy.  It is full of scenes where just as it looks like the protagonist is in dire straits, some unexpected super natural randomness saves the day.  It might make a good movie for me to watch because at least I would be soothed by my bowl of popcorn and the knowledge that it would be over in 90 minutes.  I think I must have dipped into a genre that's not for me.  There must be an audience for this novel, but I'm not part of it.  I'm moving on to something else.
0385504225|2.0|After anticipating this novel for several years, I found myself bored with it almost immediately. Between the neo-science terminology, choppy chapters, cartoon characters...it's all very mediocre.     Maybe because I have read Daniel Silva, Carlos Ruiz Zafon, PD James, Elizabeth George in the years since \\"DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels & Demons\\", I find his work to be lacking in so many ways.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|By the time I finished reading this novel, I had the same thought as Nikki Sixx himself by questioning how is he still alive?    Confronting most of the time, there were still moments when you laughed at his antics or just wanted to hug him and say everything will be okay.     Everyone dreams of fame and fortune at some time in their lives and this book is a dark reminder that not eveything is as wonderful or glamours as it appears from the outside.    Full of darkness and humour,I would recommend this to anyone who's not afraid to venture away from fairy tales.

031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn is a delightful book, I had a hard time putting it down.  Just like the other three books it really sucks you into their world.  I especially like how she switched off writing from Bella's view point to Jacob's.  I also felt like the book ended in a place that I could really appreciate and be satisfied with.  I really hope that Stephanie Meyer continues the series from different character's voices.  I just can't get enough of the books.  I'll be keeping my eye out for any other novels she puts out.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I'm surprised by all the negative review this book is getting.    If you've read The Da Vinci code and liked it you'd probably like this. The story is pretty much the same, just a few different names and such. Dan Brown is definitely consistent. The characters are simply to static to become too interesting. I have to say I was definitely more into The Da Vinci code.    To be fair, if you haven't read The Da Vinci code you'll probably love it, because you'll see it with fresh eyes. You could say the same thing about DVC for those who have read Angels & Demons.     Overall it's an excellent story, but that's about it. Nothing totally revolutionary, though I really love the way he ends it. It's not overtly grandiose or surprising. It's a very serene ending that leaves you feeling peaceful rather than confused.
0064410935|5.0|We bought these two books for our daughter's fourth grade class. They are currently reading this classic and they needed a few more copies. We almost always choose to buy from Amazon because we know the quality will be great.    As far as the book, everyone should read it!!
1582701709|1.0|I do not understand how people can believe this junk. She should work for the drive-by media. I don't know how she sleeps at night knowing that she is misleading people that are looking for help. She says nothing of eny real meaning. Its like trying to talk to human resources and have them dance around your question untill you are more confused than you already were. Very dissapointing.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|The Resistance is considerably different than Muse's previous works. Of course, all of their albums have their own unique personality, but this new release seems to hold the most surprises! I enjoy all of the songs on this eclectic album, my favorites being Exo-genesis (amazing!), MK Ultra, Unnatural Selection and Resistance. There are no tracks on here that I consider \\"skippers.\\" Having said that, the reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I think it's a wee bit lacking in some of the things that I enjoy most on previous albums: lots of heavy riffs, wailing falsetto, and bombast. I should say, it's not that The Resistance doesn't have these things. It does, just not as much. Even though each previous album has certain songs that I skip, and the new one doesn't, I'm still not sure if The Resistance will hold my interest as long as the others. But still, a very enjoyable listen. Some of these songs will be incredible live!
0385504225|2.0|I enjoy Dan Brown's books...(even, as in a previous book, when he has his hero fall off of a cliff onto an ice floe where a passing submarine just happens to hear the noise and comes to the rescue. Ok, maybe I don't enjoy that part, but I'm willing to overlook it.)  And in \\"The Lost Symbol\\" there are several interesting tidbits, thoughts, philosophies...enough to induce me to further research when the time presents itself, but there's no coherent story here.     The line of action and reaction seems to be little more than an excuse to hear the author's unique take on knowledge, religion and man's place in the universe-- a perspective that is interesting and can provide fodder for debate.     When you see what the characters are ready to trade for the \\"lost symbol\\"--that a secret organization would hand down from generation to generation, that a man would trade his life, his mother's life, his sister's life and the hero's life to protect the secret--that the secret is obscured by several layers of codes, misdirection and hidden compartments-- you're ready to suspend disbelief about the CIA and its diminutive and inscrutable security chief running such a bizarre operation.    (SPOILER)    Then you find out that the secret is that there's a bible in the cornerstone of the Washington Monument and the CIA is trying to protect several Washington VIPs from appearing on youtube because people might misunderstand what they're seeing...well, you start to feel as though the whole trip was unnecessary.    The villain is misguided,  delusional and about as inconspicuous as a 10-ft. toothbrush, yet passes easily among the secret and elite societies of the world. The police are told there's a kidnapping and send a security guard to check it out, a woman is given a lab in a secret room inside of a room with no lights because...I don't know...Her brother signed something, I guess. ...      There's more, but you're probably going to read the book anyway. There's plenty of food for thought.  Just don't expect a great story.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I remember hearing the buzz about this movie when it came out in theaters last year. I had planned to see it, but for some reason never got around to it. One year and five Academy awards later the movie \\"everyone\\" was talking about is out on video, so I decided to see what all the whoopla was about. I'm one of those people who is really picky when it comes to enjoying certain movies. Because I'm sick of all the Hollywood clichés and the \\"ooooh, ahhh, special FX without a plot routine.\\" Well...American Beauty seems to be a remedy for all the crap that is Hollywood these days.  Returning home from Blockbuster I popped in the video, turned the lights down and for some reason felt I would be disappointed once again. Needless to say, 123 minutes later as the last part of the credits rolled up and the screen turned blue I was still staring at the TV, completely enriched within my thoughts and contemplation's of American Beauty, the movie `everyone' was talking about. I mean, to put it briefly, this is one of the best movies of the 90's, one of the BEST MOVIES EVER!! Just in my humble opinion. Never, since Schindler's List or the original Star Wars has a movie been able to engross me in such a story. I mean WOW!! I have so many positives for this film. Basically the movie focuses on Lester Burnham(Kevin Spacey) who is having kind of a mid-life crisis going on. Since the movie is narrated from his point of view, we can better understand what he's going through and what his thoughts are. In the beginning of the movie he comes to the rationalization that he's trapped in a meaningless and depressing marriage. His wife (Annette Bening) shows more admiration in her career and affair with her boss than him and his daughter (Thora Birch) who basically hates them both because...well because she's a teenager. While attending a basketball half-time show to see his daughter cheerlead, Lester goes into a trance when he catches the eye of his daughter's friend Angela(Mena Suvari). The42-year-old man immediately falls for this 18? 17? year old girl. That seemed to be the catalyst to Lester's transformation. He dreams about this girl day and night and for that reason turns into a completely different person. He stops worrying, and just starts living life to its fullest. His new goal is to get into the pants of his daughter's friend and start acting like he was when he was a teenager. While his new personality may make him happy, it's making the rest of his family miserable, which builds up to the great climax. This movie just isn't about the life of Lester though; it also digs deep into the emotions of the people living around him and next door, with everything coming together at the end. This is one of those films that is hard to review, one of those films that you can't really describe in words why you like it, only in words why you dislike it. Many of my friends didn't like this movie because they couldn't accept the protagonist as a pedophile. But the girl isn't exactly a youngin' or anything, and I think the majority of people could relate to Lester's hardships. This movie has just a little bit of nudity and probably one short sex scene. I don't see how it can really offend anybody THESE days unless you work for the Christian Science Monitor or something like that. Or maybe it's just the fact that Scary Movie has given me so much shock value that I've become immune. Anyway, I recommend this movie for anybody looking for a solid 2 hours of entertainment, with good acting and great cinematography.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|More like 3 1/2 stars. I gave this 4 stars so it won't discourage casual fans. I love PT but the concept piece didn't catch my attention from the first listen. It sounds like Fear Of A Blank Planet Pt II, toned down. This would be a great thing if it were as inventive, but it isn't. It sounds like there are a lot of rehashed melodic themes and ideas from other works. It isn't a bad album, but it isn't up to par with past releases. It was a disappointment coming after the string of albums that preceded it, which were all excellent.     I love concept albums and this one had a lot of potential. I think that a concept album will usually either sink or float. This one wallows. The minute-plus segue tracks serve as more of a distraction than as welcome additions to the flow of the album. I think the work was better off without them. They slow things down too much. This album sounds like Steve W has somewhat hit a wall creatively and needs to take a step back to take a breather.    Disc 2, on the other hand, is my favorite of the two. It is reminiscent of Up The Downstair's softer moments in places.      There are times where they sound a little like Dream Theater. I am also a Dream Theater fan, but what I've always disliked about them is their sacrifice of song cohesiveness and impact to show technical virtuosity. It doesn't work well. It always ends up sounding like programmed music played by humans. What I mean is that it has the sterility of computer programmed music with its versatility to play complex passages flawlessly. This does not a good song make. Yes, many a musician will admire their chops and be amazed to jaw-dropping awe, but the music suffers because of it. In PT's case, they have never been a band to showboat gratuitously. Any time that they play something that sounds technically challenging it is within the context of the song and contributes to the impact of the music, but here they fall a little short. They sound like they're using unusual time signatures and keys to live up to their prog-rock label.     PT have always been at their best when they concentrate on the emotional impact and melodicism of the material. Here they seem to try too hard to produce a fan pleaser and not to create something unique and self-contained as in their other albums. This is not for the first-time PT enthusiast, though it will surely be embraced and worshiped by fans. Again, a good album in which the band doesn't grow but instead rests on their present laurels and tries to solidify their following in the US.     Another problem with this release is that the production is murky and not mixed well. The dynamics are poor. Sounds that are mixed up front are much louder than softer sounds and make the mix sound artificial. This is sad coming from a band that excels at creating quality recordings. I find myself turning up the volume to hear this album where even older remastered cds have a better presence when I play them on any cd player. I hope that this wasn't done consciously to later re-mix and re-market the album to cash in.       In any case, I still think that PT are the present standard-bearers as the premiere, melodic, art-rock band of the world. They are the new Pink Floyd. They succeeded where Radiohead failed to create accessible yet complex and deep music. I love Radiohead too btw but they are an acquired taste. They definitely take some getting used to. All that said, this album has some definitive standout classic PT tracks. Highlights:    Blind House  Time Flies  Octane Twisted  I Drive The Hearse  Flicker  Black Dahlia  Remember Me Lover    This is the way that I would rank PTs albums to date:    1 Deadwing  2 In Absentia  3 Stupid Dream  4 Fear Of a Blank Planet  5 Up The Downstair  6 The Incident  7 Signify  8 The Sky Moves Sideways  9 Lightbulb Sun      This one is recommended if you are already acquainted with the band.
0743201140|5.0|Studies have shown that more people suffer heart attacks on Mondays, and less people die during a recession. These two facts might seem irrelevant at a glance, but it points to the fact there are a lot of unhappy people trying to do jobs that they hate, or are unsuited to perform. Once people are forced to leave the jobs, they miraculously get healthier. Go figure. I first took the strengthsfinder on-line test when I was working with the corporate education dept of a large insurance company a few years ago, and it really revealed why I was so unhappy at my job. The report pretty much confirmed everything that I already thought about my strengths, but it was good to have an impartial company documenting everything. I have also got some interviews for potential jobs when I emailed my strengthsfinder report along with my CV, so a lot of people know about this. Anyone can learn a skill to perform, but ultimately the value you bring to a organization is the collection of strengths that make you an individual.
B001O8C5EQ|3.0|This album has some great moments on it, but it has a tendency to meander in psychedelia at times. It is a long time PT fan favorite, but personally I like some of the other offerings better. Standout tracks include:    Signify  Sleep of no Dreaming  Waiting Phase One  Sever  Dark Matter  Wake As Gun I  Smiling Not Smiling    The rest of the tracks have a tendency to ramble a little too much in electronica. Still, it is a great listen and grows on you through repeated listens. PTs first album where they are functioning as a unit instead of Stephen Wilson manning all of the controls. The tracks mentioned above will definitely appeal upon first listen and make newcomers to PT want to explore more of this extraordinary group's catalog. Make sure you get the remastered special edition if you decide to buy this. It has superior sound quality.
0385504225|2.0|Interesting references but way too preachy.  Brown assumes readers incapable of gleaning their own insights. He's compelled to answer the questions he raises rather gifting us the journey he creates.  Brown needs an \\"illuminating\\" editor to help him discover how to satisfyingly end a book.  I have learned alot from Brown, which is why I eagerly anticipated this book.  I'm hungry for him to become a \\"master\\" himself.

0060849827|5.0|The SAS Handbook is an amazing source for wilderness survival instruction.  Added to the wealth of knowledge is the compact size that makes it easily portable for the climber or hiker.  Everything you thought you'd like to know, and many things that may never have occurred to you, are written about in clear, concise language.  It is well organized in its content arrangement, which can be a blessing when info is required on an ASAP need-to-know basis.  A great tuck-and-go product filled with very useful info and techniques.

0307387178|4.0|Into the Wild tells the sad story of a young man, Chris McCandless, who gives all his money to charity and heads out alone. It is hard for some to understand why a young man with a college education, and his whole future before him, would abandon a normal life to go \\"into the wild.\\" After reading this story, one can at least attempt to understand Chris and his epic adventure.    I thought Krakauer did an excellent job of retracing Chris' journey across the US, into Mexico and eventually to the northern wilderness of Alaska. I find it amazing how many lives he touched in such an untraditional way. Chris met most people by hitching rides with them. He affected almost everyone he met, and Krakauer uses their voices to tell much of the story of Chris.    Krakauer's first story of Chris was a small article in Outdoor magazine. Krakauer became so intrigued by the story of McCandless, he went on to write \\"Into the Wild.\\" He received many letters calling Chris \\"unprepared\\" and \\"naïve.\\" I think anyone who has ever known a young man in his twenties would disagree. A man that age thinks he can handle anything that comes his way, and Chris was no exception. I think Krakauer could relate to Chris in many ways, which he shares in some of his own personal stories.     Was he foolish to go into the Alaska wilderness so unprepared? Yes, but he had survived other hard times and he honestly thought he was prepared. A few small mistakes are all it took for Chris to not make it out of the wild. A truly sad tale, but one that will catch your attention from the start.
0385504225|2.0|On the positive side, the book kept me interested enough to finish it, and I did learn some interesting things about etymology and architecture. The production value is very high, with good typography, interesting glyphs, and good design.     There were several flaws, however.    First, there was too much profanity. On the other hand, virtually nobody else seems bothered by this, so if it does not bother you, you can ignore this complaint.    Second, the description of entanglement and the supposed anticipation of string theory in ancient scriptures was unconvincing, speaking as someone acquainted with the issues.    Third, the relationship between Zack and Peter is presented pretentiously. Most of the description involved the author repeatedly complaining that Zack did not listen to the advice of his supposedly \\"wiser\\" father. Brown pompously complains that Zack had \\"shunned his parents' exhaustive attempts to provide him firm and loving guidance.\\" The endless repetitions of Zack's skepticism as to Peter's supposed wisdom were like the screeching of a senescent parent vapidly insisting on his own wisdom.     Fourth, the ending was very poor and mooted most of the rest of the plot, not to mention belying the theory that Peter is as wise as he thinks: there's no reason for Peter to have gone through so much to have protected the most innocuous secret I've seen in a thriller.

0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown has many detractors. These people abhor what \\"Literature\\" has become and make fun of the writing, story, and characters. But you know what? Two of his novels have been made into huge blockbuster movies, and I predict this one will as well.<br /><br />This story follows the continuing adventures of Robert Langdon, Harvard symbologist. This time his adventure takes him to our nations capital to track down the hidden Masonic treasure. Where this may sound a bit like National Treasure, the similarities end there. Where the aforementioned tracks down gold and valuables, this treasure is knowledge, and the knowledge is power to change the world.<br /><br />Definitely a page turner, Brown starts almost instantly with the adventure continuing until the conclusion almost non stop. I found myself reading late into the night, unable to put the book down until I found out what happened.<br /><br />They book mixes esoteric with adventure and continues throughout.<br /><br />I will say, however, that Brown's writing does suffer from some drawbacks. His use of dialog to explain things ad nauseum and his overuse of some phrases. If I had a dollar for every time someone \\"stopped short\\" in this book, I could retire today.<br /><br />That having been said, the story does what it is supposed to do. It entertained me, had me turning pages, and satisfied my hunger for a good story. After all, isn't that why we read books?
B0025KVLTC|1.0|Simple answer- not really- do they dound good- yea- so did the original- I played the songs side by side and the remasters are actually a bit shrill- great packaging and extras but to compare eleanor rigby- original sounds good- remaster- sounds good- 5.1 dolby on the Love C.D. awesome. I f they remaster  in that format I would definatly buy them all- of course I would probably buy just about any of my old cds that were remasterd in that format its that much better-but for something that may be slightly better- no.
0385504225|2.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said?<br /><br />I purchased this book on the day of its release and began reading immediately.  I don't dive into thrillers expecting great literature, but I do expect the writer to have some command over the language.  Although I enjoyed \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" I found the writing distractingly bad.  \\"The Lost Symbol,\\" unfortunately, doesn't even have the fun plot going for it.<br /><br />In \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" Robert Langdon pursued a secret with the potential to destroy the Catholic Church and wipe out thousands of years of religious doctrine.  This gave DVC a wonderful sense of tension that kept you turning the pages.  In \\"The Lost Symbol,\\" Langdon's quest revolves around a secret kept under wraps by the Free Masons for hundres of years.  Unfortunately, it fails to generate any excitement.<br /><br />In addition, the characters in this book seem to suffer from a total lack of common sense:<br /><br />Why would Langdon fly to Washington D.C. at a friend's request without actually speaking to said friend?  Why would he bring with him a top-secret package that he swore to keep hidden at all costs?<br /><br />Why, after Katherine calls 9-1-1 and gives the address where her kidnapped brother is being held hostage by a raving psychotic, do authorities send a simple security guard to investigate . . . and why is it the police never bother showing up at the address?<br /><br />Why would Katherine allow a man she's met only once into her \\"top secret\\" laboratory?<br /><br />Reading the book, you'll undoubtedly find yourself asking many of the same questions.  You'll also guess the bad guy's true identity as soon as you learn his backstory.<br /><br />What I found most annoying about the book, however, was Brown's need to spoon-feed the reader every detail.  In one scene, Langdon is trapped inside a crate that's attached to a plastic chute.  Water starts coursing down the chute and into the crate, prompting another character in the room to think, \\"He's pumping water into the crate!\\"  Yes, Dan, we get it.  Thanks! He does this repeatedly.  It made me want to scream.  The writing could have improved ten-fold with a strong editor.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"Da Vinci,\\" but couldn't get through \\"Angels and Demons.\\"  I finished \\"The Lost Symbol,\\" but found the going painful.  This is definitely my last Dan Brown.e get it.  Thanks! He does this repeatedly.  It made me want to scream.  The writing could have improved ten-fold with a strong editor.

B00197POXG|3.0|I loved this show when it aired on TV, and was excited to find it on DVD.<br />So far, I've not had any problems with the DVDs - they play great.  The video quality isn't the best, though.<br /><br />The packaging, however, could be better.  It is difficult to remove the discs from their pouches, and the first time I opened it, the leather strap came off completely (it was held in place by what looks like Scotch tape).  From the weight of the package, it is easy to see that the 'pages' containing the discs are likely going to come away from the spiral binding and I will likely have to buy separate cases for the discs.<br /><br />The packaging sucks, but the DVDs are alright.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Well... I'll keep this short and concise.<br />This is terrific film where everything is simply great: screenplay, dialogs, casting, direction, special effects, cinematography, music, action sequences, jokes, performances, direction, etc, etc, etc... I simply cannot find a flaw in this film that is worth noting.<br /><br />More than a Summer blockbuster, STAR TREK is a quality blockbuster made with lots of care and love.<br /><br />Some die hard fans were quick to note all the divergences from the original source. But, hey... this is NOT the original thing. It is reinvention that manages to keep all the fundamental elements that work while giving itself the freedom to breath some fresh ideas that ALSO work. So in my opinion, this film has lots of respect for all the audiences that are targeted here: old fans and new ones.<br /><br />Basically, the film tells the story of how all the Enterprise crew members met (Kirk, Spock, Uhura, McCoy, Scottie, Sulu and Chekov) upon the backdrop of two main narrative drives: personal (how the clashes between Kirk and Spock shaped their friendship) and plot (they must prevent a mad Romulan who came from the future from destroying the Earth). Obviously, the actual story has many twists that I do not want to spoil...<br /><br />So I think this is a beautiful film that deserves to be seen. One last note: all the actors are fine. In fact, this is one of those projects where everybody seems to be loving what they're doing.<br /><br />Favorite lines:<br />KIRK \\"You know, traveling through time, changing history... that's cheating.\\"<br />SPOCK \\"A trick I learned from an old friend.\\"<br />-----<br />SAREK \\"Speak your mind, Spock.\\"<br />SPOCK \\"That would be unwise.\\"<br />SAREK \\"What is necessary is never unwise.\\"<br />-----<br />SPOCK \\"I am now a member of an endangered species.\\"<br /><br />One last note: this film should be seen in blu-ray... because the visuals are a wow!<br />Recommended long, and prosper!

0143034901|1.0|This was a giant disappointment. After reading the reviews praising this book, I thought I would love it. UGH. It was so long and I kept thinking the story would take off and I would be entranced. DIDNT HAPPEN. Such a bummer. Cant believe I read this entire VERY long book just so I could get to the last couple of chapters for a pretty lame ending. If you are reading this book and do not like it, just read the last section. I could have read it and found out the ending immediately after reading the first section. Waste of money, waste of time. I am surprised to see how many people love this book and author. I guess I am in the minority of opinions.

I'll keep this short and concise.<br />This is terrific film where everything is simply great: screenplay, dialogs, casting, direction, special effects, cinematography, music, action sequences, jokes, performances, direction, etc, etc, etc... I simply cannot find a flaw in this film that is worth noting.<br /><br />More than a Summer blockbuster, STAR TREK is a quality blockbuster made with lots of care and love.<br /><br />Some die hard fans were quick to note all the divergences from the original source. But, hey... this is NOT the original thing. It is reinvention that manages to keep all the fundamental elements that work while giving itself the freedom to breath some fresh ideas that ALSO work. So in my opinion, this film has lots of respect for all the audiences that are targeted here: old fans and new ones.<br /><br />Basically, the film tells the story of how all the Enterprise crew members met (Kirk, Spock, Uhura, McCoy, Scottie, Sulu and Chekov) upon the backdrop of two main narrative drives: personal (how the clashes between Kirk and Spock shaped their friendship) and plot (they must prevent a mad Romulan who came from the future from destroying the Earth). Obviously, the actual story has many twists that I do not want to spoil...<br /><br />So I think this is a beautiful film that deserves to be seen. One last note: all the actors are fine. In fact, this is one of those projects where everybody seems to be loving what they're doing.<br /><br />Favorite lines:<br />KIRK \\"You know, traveling through time, changing history... that's cheating.\\"<br />SPOCK \\"A trick I learned from an old friend.\\"<br />-----<br />SAREK \\"Speak your mind, Spock.\\"<br />SPOCK \\"That would be unwise.\\"<br />SAREK \\"What is necessary is never unwise.\\"<br />-----<br />SPOCK \\"I am now a member of an endangered species.\\"<br /><br />One last note: this film should be seen in blu-ray... because the visuals are a wow!<br />Recommended long, and prosper!
0156012197|4.0|I was thrilled to find this great book on Amazon.  A beautiful story about how fragile we are, this book isn't easy to find, but Amazon carries it.  The only disappointment is that I could not get it in hard cover.  I bought this book for a friend a couple of years ago, through Amazon as well, and I believe it was in hard cover.  Would be nice if this options was available, as it makes for such a great gift.  Thanks,  Maria
B002K0WBXW|5.0|THE PROPOSAL presents us with a different element: Sandra Bullock as the mean character. This is a very nice change for Sandra who has always played the good girl. And being mean, she is a delight to watch!<br /><br />Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is the executive editor-in-chief of a book publishing company. In order to avoid being deported back to Canada (and fired by the company) she forces her assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her. He grudgingly accepts, under the condition that he is promoted to the position of editor. When the government investigates, the two are forced to spend the weekend with his parents in Alaska in order make the lie more convincing to the US officials investigating them.<br /><br />The good thing about this film is that everything works great:<br />a)The script very well written... light, funny and tasteful.<br />b)The casting is perfect: Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have perfect chemistry and all the supporting roles have terrific actors like Craig T. Nelson ([[ASIN:B000V4UFZK POLTERGEIST]]), Mary Steenburgen ([[ASIN:B000MRNWK6 PARENTHOOD]]) and the always-funny Betty White ([[ASIN:B002N8WLYK THE GOLDEN GIRLS]]).<br />c)The jokes are very funny.<br /><br />Basically, this is the odd-couple-type of comedy, with all the elements that work.<br />Perfect for watching anytime with anyone. The [[ASIN:B002K0WBYG blu-ray edition]] (also available) has the advantage of boosting the BEAUTIFUL Alaska locations used on the film.<br /><br />Favorite lines:<br />MARGARET TATE \\"What am I allergic to?\\"<br />ANDREW PAXTON \\"Pine nuts, and the full spectrum of human emotion.\\"<br /><br />Recommended!

0439023483|4.0|Suzanne Collins' post apocalyptic world in The Hunger Games and  is a combination of Richard Connell's The Most Dangerous Game, George Orwell's 1984 and William Golding's Lord of the Flies. The main reason this book had such a strong affect as I read is because children are the victims here and it all comes down to survival of the fitness for these poor innocents. Only the strong will survive and it doesn't matter what age you are. If you are weak and can't kill off your attacker before they do you, then you will become their prey, unless you can become the predator instead.<br /><br />These books are not comfortable reads. In part it has to do because of children killing one another due to a society that suffers under the Capitol, a force no one wants to go against. The Hunger Games begins in the distant future where the United States has been eradicated because of countless natural disasters and war. This end of day scenario leads to a new, darker world where out of the ashes comes even more famine, sickness and poverty. The US is now known as Panem, ruled by the Capitol that in turn rules over the twelve districts. Originally there were thirteen of these districts but because they rose up against the Capitol, they were defeated and the thirteenth was obliterated. Each year there is an event called the Hunger Games as punishment against the districts.<br /><br />The Hunger Games goes as follows: each of the twelve districts, through a lottery chosen, will send one girl and one boy between the ages of twelve to eighteen to participate. They are called tributes and these twenty-four will be in an outdoor arena over an unlimited period where they must fight to the death. The last one standing wins. They also have to put up with harsh weather conditions and killer animals controlled by the Capitol. This is the Capitol's way of stopping rebellion. Instead of making the adults suffer, stick them where it hurts and make their children suffer instead. And the really messed up thing is that this is broadcasted on television, much like the reality shows we watch and enjoy so much. The ultimate prize is that the victor of the Hunger Games will have a life of luxury for them and their family.<br /><br />In District 12 lives sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen with her younger sister Prim and their fragile mother who is a healer. Katniss is the glue that keeps her family together ever since their father died. Because food is so scarce, Katniss toned her hunting and gathering skills. If she is found hunting in the woods, beyond the electric fence that surrounds District 12, she will be punished. As the reaping commences, Prim is one of the children picked. Katniss knows Prim doesn't have a chance in winning and volunteers as a tribute. And when the other tribute is announced, Katniss is in for another shock. It is Peeta Mellark, the baker's son. Katniss and Peeta have a history together, one that Katniss wants to forget.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol and treated like VIP's. During this time, Peeta figures out how to manipulate the public. You want to gain sponsors while you are in the games, because they will send you things to help you survive. He admits his undying love for Katniss. It seems he has always loved her. Katniss is appalled because she doesn't feel that way about him. Is he lying to gain sympathy or is he telling the truth? And then the games are on.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a chilling read. The desperation and horrors that these children and their families go through is sickening. To think that there could be a future like this really made for difficult reading. Every emotion was engaged while I read and I have to hand it to Suzanne Collins for writing a complex world.<br /><br />Suzanne's world building skills are simple amazing. I could visualize the sights and sounds of District 12 and the Capitol. She also makes sure to show how the family unit and basic human needs are so very important. Most importantly the questions of one's morals comes into play here. Katniss and Peeta are essentially very moral and caring people. But what does one do when it comes down to you and the person you care about? Knowing there can only be one victor and you alone are the one to make this heavy life altering decision can bring many consequences. When backed into a corner where you have to kill others to protect yourself and come out alive, would you be able to do it? Would you be able to live with the guilt of taking an innocent life because of an evil and vindictive higher power that forces you to?<br /><br />The Hunger Games is very violent. We actually see the children in the games being killed. We see them being tortured. There were a few times I had to put this book down because the descriptive passages were too much to handle. You end up rooting for Katniss and those she ends up protecting in the games. A few tears will find their way down your cheeks.<br /><br />Suzanne raises these questions and more. The Hunger Games is a book that brings to light so many issues and places it in the hands of the next generation, the children who look at life with an open mind, but through the way society and the world around them acts, they learn some harsh realities. I strongly recommend that parents read The Hunger Games with their children because both can learn so much from this story. Suzanne Collins shows a different side of human nature and works it in such a way where after you finish reading the last page, you will be questioning your own actions and morals.<br /><br />Katiebabsmes into play here.

B0015HOFZI|1.0|I bought a new turntable as my venerable old Realistic from Radio Shack needed a new belt and stylus.  Friends advised me not to bother getting it fixed as new turntables were vastly better - technology had improved, etc.   After reading positive reviews I selected the Sony which had an option to create CD's should I ever wish.      From the moment I set up the turntable it was apparent that it was playing a little too fast.  This was not so noticeable with male singers and with music, but was painfully apparent when listening to women.  Their voices were coming out in a chirpy falsetto, rather like the chipmunks.  I tried the consumer help line at Sony, both online and by phone, but found it extremely disappointing.  The response was so slow that I think they were putting everything through a translator.  the only suggestion they could come up with was to take it to a Sony authorized repair shop, but gave no indication of where there was one in my area, and how to claim under the warranty.  In fact, I am not even sure there IS a warranty.      By this time I had used up the time in which I could return the player for a refund, so I have to live with it.  I took the belt off and tried stretching it a little, but that did not work, so I found a place which stocked belts and the stylus I needed (at a price almost equivalent to what I paid for the new Sony) and went back to using my old faithful.  If I ever need a new belt I have one on the Sony!     I very much doubt that I will ever use it to create CD versions of my records.
0439023491|3.0|Suzanne Collins' Catching Fire leads off where The Hunger Games end. Katniss Evergreen and Peeta Mellark of District 12 are the winners of the seventy-forth Hunger Games. They almost decided to commit suicide by eating poisoned berries because at the last minute the Capitol changed the rules on them where there could be only one winner. Instead of fighting to the death, their last rebellious act would be where they both die holding hands. Peeta wanted Katniss to live because he loved her so. Katniss couldn't live with the guilt of Peeta dying and her living. They decide to go out with a bang. But because the television audience, who watched them in the arena became their biggest fans, the outpouring of support for them both was too strong. The Capitol calls them both the winner and allows them to go back to their homes in District 12 where they will have a life fit for a king. Katniss thinks all will be well. She can do her final duty on the Victory Tour beside Peeta where they pretend that they are deeply in love and then vanish into a life of peace and quiet.<br /><br />But it isn't that easy. Because of Katniss and Peeta's act of defiance, the other Districts are ready to rebel. President Snow who rules over the Capitol despises Katniss and knows that she is faking her feelings for Peeta. It is a rouse to keep her safe and continue to be the much loved girl of the people. President Snow holds her responsible for these rumblings of rebellion and if she can't stop it, he will lash out. He will strike with vengeance against everything she holds dear. He can't kill her or Peeta, so instead he will look towards Gale, the young man Katniss has grown to love.<br /><br />Poor Katniss was only thinking of surviving while play the games. Now she must squash the spirit of those in the districts who want to go against the Capitol. And because the Capitol is all ruling and they like to change the rules, they decide on another game. The talk of rebellion coincides with the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Hunger Games, also know as the Quarter Quell. Now all the winners of the past Hunger Games will compete against each other to the death until there is only one winner. This time it is not just children, but adults also. Katniss and Peeta are sent back into the games, knowing they may have to kill each other once again in order to make it out alive.<br /><br />Catching Fire is very much a survival of the fittest book, much like The Hunger Games was, but this time the twist is that not only are the young people thrown into the fire, so to speak, but the adults who have as much to loose as they do. You can't help but be on the edge of your seat as you read wondering if the Capitol will go as far as to annihilate certain Districts that will no longer be quiet or beaten into submission. This sequel has much more of a desolate feel than the first because even though Katniss has come out the winner, she has so much to lose. The stakes have risen for Katniss in ways she could have never imagined.<br /><br />Even though this is an action packed, nail biting suspense story, I felt something was a bit lacking. The fact that the Capitol can do whatever they want at a moment's notice didn't sit well with me. All of a sudden the President and the ones who make the rules decide to change them so suddenly because they are annoyed by one girl who got the better of them. It reeks too much of manipulation on Suzanne's part, to keep the reader engaged. I would have preferred more about the uprising of the Districts rather than another Hunger Games where everything goes. Yes, I know the Capitol is not fair in its thinking and their point is to destroy freedom and free will, but by having all the past winners come together and fight to the death just seems too much and doesn't shock as it should. And the way things work out in such a way for Katniss was too unbelievable. Katniss is a bright girl, but this time around, everything seems to fall into her lap. We know she will survive come the end no matter what happens. That suspense factor has been dulled down in regards to her.<br /><br />Even with that in mind, Katniss is still very much a strong and awe inspiring character. Her dedication and sacrifice keeps the reader hooked. She is a bit lost in the world with her new found fame and her feelings between Peeta and Gale. Readers will be torn by whom they think Katniss should be with because both men are wonderful in their characterizations, even though Peeta sticks out a bit more for me. Perhaps it is all due to the kissing he and Katniss shared together in The Hunger Games?<br /><br />The last chapter is a bit shocking because I didn't expect it. And when you read the last sentence, your mouth will drop and you may be at a loss for words. It's quite the cliff hanger that will have people clenching their fists wanting the next book.<br /><br />Katiebabs<br /><br />[[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]]e know she will survive come the end no matter what happens.

B0028RXXFC|5.0|It's too bad that Rome couldn't have made it at least one more season, but the production cost was way to high, even for HBO. After The Sopranos (seasons 1-3 especially), Rome and Deadwood are tied for my second favorite series from this network, although I really enjoy True Blood and Carnivale too. The characters are all interesting and well acted, the action scenes are brutally realistic, the production design is epic and the storylines are captivating. What's not to love? I do think that the first season is better than the second, but that's not saying it's not worth five stars as well. If you liked the film Gladiator or just history in general, you will learn much more about Rome and the many colorful characters who live in it. Now if only HBO would stop getting rid of classic shows like Rome, Deadwood and Carnivale after two or three seasons.<br /><br />The regular DVDs that I own look like they are almost HD quality anyway, so I don't know if the extra money for the Blu-ray is going to be worth it or not. I'm not going to upgrade, but those buying Rome for the first time will have to decide if the slight improvements in picture and sound is worth the extra dough.

0385342020|3.0|Lara Lington never really knew her one hundred an five year old great aunt, Sadie. So you can imagine her surprise when Sadie appears in front of Lara's eyes. Sadie is very much a ghost. She demands that Lara stop her funeral. She can't go yet...not till Sadie has her necklace. So how do you stop a funeral? Well, of course be standing up and saying that you think your great aunt has been murdered.<br /><br />I thought there were some funny and quirky moments between Lara and Sadie. I was even laughing out loud at some of them. Though these moments were few and far between for me. Twenties Girl is a light-hearted, humorous, chick-lit read. My favorite moment was when Sadie dressed Lara for her date. She dressed her just like a flapper, even down to the makeup she wore and the way she talked. Because Sadie and Lara were such shining stars, everyone else played second string to them and kind of faded to the background. I did enjoy this book enough that I plan to check out some of Sophie Kinsella's other novels.

B000002H48|4.0|The performances - and the songs themselves - are uneven, but overall, it's a good listen.
B000002H70|3.0|By 1989, I had turned my back on The Cure.  They were yesterday's news.  At the time if you had asked me \\"who is The Cure?\\" I would say the Cure was a post-punk British rock band that should best be remembered for three great studio albums recorded as 3 member band in the early 1980s (Seventeen Seconds, Faith, and Pornography) and an interesting live record in 1984 (Concert) recorded with a 5 member band.  Other than that, most of what the Cure had been making in the mid-1980s was \\"Bubble Gum Goth\\" - silly teenage new wave pop music in another package.  It was frivolous music.  But it made a lot of money for Robert Smith, Simon Gallup et al.  It was a product that could really be sold to American teenagers in a way that \\"Pornography\\" just couldn't. After Kiss Me x3, I dismissed the Cure.      Then along came Disintegration.  Granted, Disintegration doesn't represent a major break from the mid-1980s The Cure.  It is a record recorded with the 5 member line up that had become standard for the Cure's mid-1980s work.  It was a record rich in keyboards and synthesizers, unlike the original trilogy of great The Cure records I mention above, which had been mostly guitar, bass and drums (with a little bit of keyboard as an afterthought).  So what makes Disintegration stand out as a good record, distinct from The Head on the Door, The Top, Japanese Whispers or Kiss Me x3?  In my opinion, it is because they came full circle.  They went back to the sound that they had on records like Faith and Pornography, and found a way to synthesize that early, dark sound with the full resources of the 5 member band.     It isn't a perfect album, mind you.  Looking back 20 years later, I never listen to \\"Fascination Street\\" or \\"Love Song\\".  Those are more of the mid-1980s The Cure that I would just as soon forget.  But songs like \\"Prayers for Rain\\" and \\"Same Deep Water as You\\" are powerfully good tracks, even today.      This isn't the greatest The Cure record (I still give that to Pornography. What can I say? I am old school).  But it is definitely in my short list of the top 3 records by the Cure.  And it marked a new trajectory for them as artists - less frivolous, more serious, but with the big, full, lush sound they developed in the mid-1980s.  The proof, however, is in the concerts.  I saw the Cure several times in the mid-1980s.  I remember on the Kiss Me 3x tour, almost all of the material they played was from the mid-1980s, except for an obligatory performance of Forest.  But by the time they recorded Paris (but not \\"Show\\"!), they apparently had found a way to integrate songs from their 3 great records into their play list again.  This was a much needed re-adjustment of a band that had drifted way too far from the sound that made them great to begin with.
B002FOQY04|5.0|Nice cd put together with very good prodution team start to finish. Been a long time since Clevelands been on the map. Could have done without Common on the narration but i guess thats what makes it different. only mild disappointment was the misconception of the bonus tracks.
B001GCUO1Q|2.0|I was looking forwards to this movie (after all X-Men I and X-Men III were both good), but unfortunately, Wolverine is a special effects-laden soul-less mess.  Actors flying around on wires, men in rubber suits, guys waving fake swords around.  If I wanted to watch a fake-looking movie then I would watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (and I don't want to watch that either!).  Now, I would agree that the Sabretooth character in this movie is better than the portrayal in X-Men I, where he was portrayed as a dim-witted pro-wrestler type, but 2nd-rate crappy superheroes like Gambit and an annoying cowboy-hat wearing version of Nightcrawler (ie: teleports around) do not help the movie.  One would even think that matching up two completely equal fighters with equal healing abilties in Sabertooth (bigger and stronger) and Wolverine (faster, and has unbreakable bones), would be exciting, but the fights are un-inspired and just not that great.  If this is Marvel's idea of a good \\"Origins\\" movie, then count me out.
1400049628|5.0|This book was a very easy read and a must have for zombie believers! Even if you don't believe in zombies it is still entertaining.
0061854549|3.0|A broad survey of how we often make decisions and judgments that ultimately are wrong or not in our best interest, this book is best when it talks about specific issues of economics and rather mundane when it examines general psychological behavior.  Mr. Ariely is not a gifted writer, but he is a serviceable one.  He also is not shy about citing other people involved in this work.  Culturally, he is definitely an Israeli, which means American readers, especially women, may groan when he writes about male/female relationships.  The book is front loaded with the interesting material, which focuses on such topics as pricing.  Toward the end, the author seems to be out of his depth in his cursory looks at broad topics like dishonesty.<br /><br />From the standpoint of a scientist, his descriptions of his experiments seem a bit alarming.  They seem overly simplistic and more importantly have far too few people surveyed to fully back the conclusions of the work.  I can only hope that the author, in trying to make the book more accessible to the lay audience, has left out important information on how his work is done.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that there is about 1/2 a book worth of interesting material here.  That's probably better than most books today.  It tends to have a fairly engaging and humorous style.  It's very accessible (although my mother-in-law, a very bright woman, said to me that a couple of the chapters were tough going).  I'd recommend reading the first four chapters and skipping the rest.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|McDowall is excellent as the central character. Apart form O'Tool[is O'Tool acting?]the other characters are reduced to appearances at certain times in the footage. Mirren's talents are completely wasted. The film is a collection of scenes that offer snap shots of events [real and imagined]rather than tell a story. And the story line deviates from history - for what purpose? There is enough historical data on which to compose a script, and all of it useful - but forall of its shortcomings including a rather boring brothel scene towards the film's conclusion it remains a remarkable film for the time it was made.It is well worth a look and remains compulsive viewing.And one last thing - it is too long and even the edited version cannot get over the lack of continuity of sequences.

B002JYPV3G|5.0|Ahhh, has it really been 10 years? One of Slipknots best albums before they started to go downhill... I just wanna say I am still a fan, but the self titled and iowa was when Slipknot was in their prime. I don't care for their new stuff really but they do have some ok hard tracks. Anyways back to the 10th Anniv. I am sure a lot of people bought this for Purity. Me as well. I do own the original cd with Frail Limb Nursery and Purity. Sadly I only have the case due to someone who has the cd that I could never get it back now. (Long story) which pisses me off. So I figured it be nice to own a copy of it again. Plus we get a bunch of Remixes and B-sides and a DVD. The DVD is great, bunch of cool stuff to see and a whole live concert. You also see Clowns old drum tech who is one of the singers from the band downthesun. What more could you ask for?....oh yeah... how about FRAIL LIMB NURSERY!? What the hell happened? The intro to Purity is just amazing and they leave it out? WHY? The had to remove F.L.N. and Purity due to legal reasons, and now they are able to put Purity back on an album and they just get rid of the intro to the song? I feel like this album is incomplete. Anyone hoping to have the original CD that they were never were able to get will be disappointed. Sure it may not seem like a big deal to some, but to others it is. I like to own a REAL copy of songs.    Pros:  -One of the best albums they released with a bunch of extra tracks   -Has over 20 songs  -Comes with a DVD with about an hour of just randomness which in some parts are funny as hell  -A whole live concert  -Brings you back to when slipknot was real heavy      Cons:  -They didn't put Frail Limb Nursery on the album which should be.  -Most of the Remixes/B-Sides where already released on the Digipack version which you can still buy easily unlike the few that were only on the wait and bleed single which is not as easy to find. So there is really nothing new to this album at all...  -Wish they couldof added some older songs like songs from Crowz, or other B-sides, Demos, Remixes that haven't been released from that era.      Overall this is a good re-re-re-release cd of this album if you don't own the other 3 versions of it (which I currently do) The only real reason to buy this album is for the DVD. If you are just getting into Slipknot then I would highly recommend buying this then the other versions of the self titled album.
1582701709|1.0|The low rating here is because the book goes too far in its claims.  I am truly a believer that faith can bring about some amazing things but this book makes it too easy - to the point of recklessness - to get everything you've ever wanted.  The claims about fixing your eyesight and pretending you have more more in your checking account are laughable.  Unfortunately, there are people who beleve this stuff - or I say desparately want to believe.  Just ask the universe for whatever you want and then believe you'll get it.  I'm sorry but it isn't that easy.  I seriously hope our society can rise above this sort of silly and lazy behavior.
1400032717|4.0|In The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, Mark Haddon provides a detective mystery through the voice of Christopher, a young man living in Swindon, UK who was born with Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism.  As the story progresses, the mystery of who murdered the neighbor's dog becomes secondary and life inside Christopher's world becomes primary.  His search for the truth of his mother's death becomes the central mystery.  Along the way we see not only his struggles in life, but also those of his father and his mother in caring for and living with Christopher.    Christopher lives in a world many of us cannot fully imagine.  His acceptance of people's words and actions is literal; his days are laid out in unbending time tables; and his world centers in a handful of locations.  He dreams big and wants to be an astronaut but accepts the impossibility of being one because of his limitations.  But as he states, in my favorite line from the book, \\"..you [can] still want something that is very unlikely to happen.\\"    The book is nothing if not unique.  Along the way, we are presented with page after page of interesting information, which may or may not be relevant to the storyline but helps us to understand the powerful intellect of Christopher's mind.  The powerful intellect is diametrically opposite to how he presents to others and how they perceive him.  He's a handful, a freak, a problem, a wetter of his pants to strangers.  To friends and love ones he is an A student in Maths Level A.  Perspective is everything to understanding him to those around him.    I know from looking at some of the other reviews, especially the one stars, people have argued that Mr. Haddon did not accurately capture Asperger's disease.  This criticism has come from people with Asperger's and relatives of those with the disease.  I do not have the disease and know of no one with the disease and therefore cannot provide a comment on this matter.  However, I can say that Mr. Haddon did take me into a world and mind that was very different.  I put the book down convinced that there are people who think and live like Christopher.    I found this a very good, easy read that is well worth the time put in to reading it.  Enjoy.
0765356147|5.0|The Mistborn series has ended with a ground shattering third book, Hero of Ages!  This series is so epic if it was movies, done right, they would easily gross top ratings and bucks!!  Hero of Ages is huge!  The scale is bigger than the previous books and the action is tremendous!  Surprises occur around every corner and just when you think you've figured it out...you didn't.  Awesome series and fantastic conclusion!

B0016B6ZKG|4.0|I love, love, love Donna Summer's voice, and it still sounds fantastic!  Her songs on this CD are most enjoyable, very energetic and uplifting.  However, there is one exception, \\"Slide Over Backwards.\\"  (Had this track been omitted, the disc would be perfect IMO.)  All other songs are superb, though, and make Crayons a worthwhile purchase.  The Queen is definitely back!<br /><br />(R.I.P. Donna Summer / LaDonna Adrian Gaines, 31 Dec 1948 - 17 May 2012.  Thank you for sharing your gift of song.  You will be forever remembered, missed, and loved.)
B001R4SYPG|5.0|This is one of the works and recodings that put minimalism on the map. Riley's \\"In C\\" has been called the \\"The Rite of Spring\\" of our time. This first recording led the way to the many other versions that appeared but this is the first and the best (The more recent Innova CD is worth hearing). Fans of minimalism either have the original  CBS recording or should add this reisssue to their collection. A must-have.
160459201X|2.0|I was looking for an educated book on the subconscious and I purchased this one based on the great reviews. The reasons for it's success are beyond my understanding. The book is too religious that is actually distracting. Just in it's second page, it asks the reader \\"do you know how to pray effectively?\\", the word \\"God\\" is used everywhere and each chapter contains at least one quote from the Bible. The book would make more sense if it were entitled \\"The Power of Your Prayers\\". With a title like that, the book would be decent. But I'm not concern about praying, I wanted to learn about the subconscious and I feel completely mislead with this book and it's title. I honestly feel like giving the book away.

0385504225|2.0|Speaking as someone who loved The DaVinci Code as well as Angels & Demons, I approached The Lost Symbol with a lot of excitement and was ready to read it in one sitting (like I had the other two).      Unfortunately, Dan Brown's latest literary attempt got off to a slow start.  In many places reminding me of the Nicolas Cage movie, \\"National Treasure\\".  Eventually things began to pick up and during the middle third of the book I had trouble reading fast enough!      Then I reached the last 15 chapters or so, and I became extremely disappointed.  Not only do I feel like I was cheated out of a great \\"Brown-worthy\\" ending, but I felt as if he didn't even know where he wanted the end of the story to go so he just kind of let it dangle.  Where this novel started off reminding me of a movie, the end left me feeling like I'd just finished reading \\"The Secret\\" and that is not a compliment.      If you're looking for a great thriller with twists and turns, you may be better served choosing something else.

B001OQCV2Y|5.0|Historical accuracy certainly wasn't the first thing that renowned director Quentin Tarantino had in mind when creating Inglourious Basterds, and as we see in this film, that's not necessarily a bad thing at all. Using his traditional blend of sharp dialogue, explicit violence, and overlapping story lines, Tarantino has created an epic, grandiose and visually stunning film that easily ranks among the summer's best, and in my opinion, his best film since Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />  For as tense and action packed as this film is, dialogue plays a vital role in sustaining the ever mounting tension in this film and we are made aware of this right from the very beginning. The film opens with a brilliantly crafted scene set on a dairy farm in rural France where we are introduced to Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), who is one of  the most ferocious and calculating villains in recent memory, and who I feel could be a possible sleeper for Best Actor. He proves to be a master of interrogation and has knack for spotting anyone holding back the truth. What is amazing to me is how viscous and intimidating his character is in his words alone. He is sophisticated, suave and well spoken yet is as ruthless and sadistic as anyone of the Basterds who are after his scalp. Despite its casual appearance and heavy reliance on dialogue, the first scene is filled with tension and suspense as the audience can almost feel that something disastrous could happen at any second, and Col. Landa is the primary reason for this.<br /><br />  The film also follows Brad Pitt's character, Lt. Aldo Raine and his \\"Basterds\\" who are on a mission that has simply one goal'kill as many Nazis as possible (On a side not, I really wish Brad Pitt didn't have so much of the Hollywood glam and spot light surrounding him because many times people overlook what an excellent actor he is, and this film is no exception). Lt. Raine and his Basterds are ruthless and uncompromising in their doings, beating and scalping almost every Nazi they encounter. And the ones that they do let go leave with a painful and permanent parting gift and a reminder to Hitler and his regime just exactly what the Basterds are all about.<br /><br />  One thing that I was completely surprised by yet really didn't notice at first was how much of this film isn't in English. Almost half of the film is spoken in French and German using English subtitles. One of the reasons I don't feel I noticed it so much is how visually engaging the film is. It is filmed in a way that it almost comes off as a graphic novel put onto screen. The film climaxes in a heart-pounding and beautifully stunning 30 minute finale where all 3 story lines finally come to together during a German movie premiere in Paris in which Hitler and all leading members of the Third Reich are attending. It is a fitting end to the Jewish revenge story that never happened.<br /><br />  Inglourious Basterds is absurd, funny, over the top, gaudy, and yet oddly moving and endearing at the same time. Quentin Tarantino stated before filming this movie that he wanted this to be his masterpiece and the last line of the film is very blunt in echoing those thoughts of his. A masterpiece? Not quite, but still one hell of a movie.<br /><br />  Grade: 9.1/10<br /><br />-Jeffrey Ryanlping almost every Nazi they encounter.

B00275EGWO|5.0|I will be the first to say that I am sick and tired of hearing about the war in Iraq. Obviously I don't mean that in the sense that I don't care about the war and think that we, as citizens of a country fighting in this war, shouldn't concern ourselves with it. I mean this in the sense that I am sick and tired of hearing these radical left and right wing media outlets simply bickering back and forth about it. All we hear is how it was a mistake to enter into this war and we should pull out our troops immediately, or on the flip side how it was necessary to enter because we believed they had weapons of mass destruction and we needed to free the Iraqi people from Saddam Hussein's reign of terror. It's been over 5 years now'get over it. We are at war in Iraq and there is nothing we can do about it. This is one of the many reasons why The Hurt Locker was such a brilliant film. It is a war movie with absolutely no political agenda behind it whatsoever. It is a brutally honest portrayal of the Iraq War. It isn't about why we are at war. It isn't about why we shouldn't  be at war. It is about being at war'and this war is absolute hell.<br /><br />  The specific group of soldiers that this film follows is the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) whose job is to, very simply, find and disarm bombs. The biggest thing that makes the Iraq war so much different than any other war, and what this film does a excellent job of portraying, is that these troops aren't fighting a country or a known enemy. They are trying to fight the unstoppable force of terror, and there are no battle lines in this fight. Besides the soldiers wearing a uniform, the troops fighting this war on terror have no idea who their enemy is and isn't. The film makes this clear from the very first scene, where we see Sgt. Matt Thompson (Guy Pierce) walking up to a pile of bombs they have just discovered and that he is attempting to disarm. His fellow commanders, Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) frantically look around trying to spot any suspicious onlookers who would could be trying to detonate the bombs. By the time they spot any terrorist it could already be too late. This constant sense of urgency, panic and fear is felt in each scene  as the EOD squad knows that their unknown enemy could strike at any time.<br /><br />  The movie also acts as a mini character study of Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) for whom this war has become a drug. While disarming the explosives, he almost never shows any sign of fear or panic despite knowing that even the slightest wrong move could kill him. He has become consumed and obsessed by the adrenaline rush he receives with the finding and disarming of each bomb. When this \\"drug\\" is taken away from him and he is at home with his family, he appears emotionless and empty. There is a great little scene towards the end of the film where he is in a grocery store shopping with his wife and kid and is asked to go pick out a box of cereal. He is then shown standing alone in an aisle staring blankly into dozens of different cereal boxes. He has a look of complete detachment and hopelessness in his face. He has been able to disarm close 900 bombs with complete ease, and now even the simplest task of picking out groceries seems impossible.<br /><br />  The Hurt Locker is a near perfect film. It is both an uncompromising and brutally realistic look at the hopelessness and paranoia that our troops are facing everyday in Iraq, as well as a poignant and engrossing character study of a man who has become consumed by war. The film's tag line reads \\"You'll know when you're in it.\\" While an audience could never fully understand what it is like to be fighting this war on terror by watching a movie, this comes as close as you can get to a first hand account.<br /><br />Grade: 9.5/10<br /><br />-Jeffrey Ryan<br />[...]) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) frantically look around trying to spot any suspicious onlookers who would could be trying to detonate the bombs.

B0007Y4TVU|3.0|3 1/2    The System continued to improve its personally quirky assault of cynical metal but instead of combining two consecutive releases into what could have been their most concise, they harp on cultural criticism and churn speed metal predictably to the disadvantage of their special talents to make these familiar aggressive setups worthwhile.
B0021L8US0|3.0|As I had mentioned in my review of Moon, the science fiction genre has been going through quite a change the past few years, and it hasn't necessarily been a change for the better. Intelligent scripts, interesting plots and most importantly, coherent story lines are a rarity nowadays in sci-fi films. It seems that big explosions and hot girls are being simply acting as eye candy to distract the audience from the fact that these movies have little to no substance behind them. This is why films like District 9 are a breath of fresh air, as Producer Peter Jackson and Director Neill Blomkamp prove that you can still make a smart and compelling popcorn-flick without having Megan Fox be half naked (not necessarily a bad thing) throughout the whole film or spending millions of dollars on special effects (I'm talking to you Michael Bay).<br /><br />  The film centers around the event of large alien space craft that has come to earth and halted, hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa. Weapons research company, Multi-National United has taken over the area and has secluded the aliens and their space craft in an area known as \\"District 9\\".  The movie's strength lies in its ability to take socially and politically relevant issues such as Apartheid and treatment of illegal aliens and apply them to the classic sci-fi concept of extraterrestrials coming to earth and how we interact with them.<br /><br />  What makes this film unique is that it raises an interesting question about humans having contact with aliens from outer space; what if they're not sadistic, bloodthirsty creatures looking to take over our planet? What if they're just a bunch of relatively mild-mannered, cat-food loving buffoons who don't have a place to go? My first guess would be something involving a reality-TV show (eg. \\"So You Think You Can Dance with an Alien?\\", or \\"Alien Idol\\"). Realistically, however, one would be hard-pressed to argue against the approach that this film takes. We encounter a life-form who appears to be non-violent and has technology that we don't have, so we exploit them in whatever way possible to learn more about them and how we can use it.<br /><br />  While being a very good film, what prevented it from being a great film for me was that I felt it dragged a bit in the middle after starting out with a very engaging pseudo-documentary type approach, as well as the choice to use a more comical protagonist, Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), who is shown to not be suit at all to handle the situation he has been put into and not really fit into the intense and dramatic approach this film was taking.  Despite this, District 9 is an original and thought provoking science fiction film that should resonate well with moviegoers this summer.<br /><br />Grade: 7.5/10<br /><br />-Jeffrey Ryan<br />[...]ncounter a life-form who appears to be non-violent and has technology that we don't have, so we exploit them in whatever way possible to learn more about them and how we can use it.

B000WGWQG8|2.0|I was very disappointed with this series.  I only watched half of it. The insert in the box said it was rated PG but I didn't know that full frontal nudity, and explicit love scenes, were included in that rating.  I expected a film that would give my family a better understanding of history, not sex-education and anatomy.  It was also more gory than I expected.  None of that needed to be in there to portray the historical events. There should have been a warning in the purchase information.  My children were appalled that I would buy something like this.  It was very embarrassing that I did.  I bought it because I love American history but \\"Hollywood\\" has to ruin everything.  When will they learn that they don't have to include sex and gore to sell a film.
B00275EGTC|4.0|Throughout the past decade or so, the science-fiction genre has gone through quite a change. Things such as the supernatural, space travel, cloning, utopian societies, and artificial intelligence were all topics that once dominated the genre. Not only that, but they were used in ways that challenged pre-supposed beliefs and norms on what the human being is capable of, whether or not we are truly alone in this universe, as well as questioning the true nature of our existence. In recent years, however, the sci-fi genre has moved away from making films that challenge our beliefs and shifted into making films that focus more on action sequences and explosions which many times translate into a few cheap thrills with not much substance behind them. And while there is no doubt I enjoy the occasional escapist-type fun in the science fiction films of today, (Star Trek, Cloverfield), when a film like Moon comes along, it gives me hope that this genre is not dead and that there are still directors out there who understand and respect the intrinsic elements that make the science fiction genre so great.<br /><br />  One of the obvious strengths of the movie is Sam Rockwell's fantastic portrayal of Sam Bell, the lone astronaut on the tail end of his 3 year mission on, you guessed it, the Moon. His job over course of his contract with Lunar Industries has been to extract and distribute to earth \\"helium-3\\", which has now become the main energy source for our planet. Rockwell does an excellent job of elevating a rather tranquil and slow paced character study into an emotionally charged, compelling sci-fi drama.<br /><br />  The film does a great job of showing us the tremendous toll that isolation and loneliness can have on the human psyche, as well raise some interesting ethical questions along the way. Combined with excellent cinematography and the smart and ambitious directing of newcomer Duncan Jones, Moon is a refreshing and welcome entry into the science fiction catalog that should resonate well with fans of the genre, both new and old.<br /><br />  Grade: 7.7/10<br /><br />-Jeffrey Ryan<br />[...]atalog that should resonate well with fans of the genre, both new and old.

B000069KGM|3.0|Chicago Transit Authority - Chicago Transit Authority (3.43 stars)<br />Original Release: April 28, 1969<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />Introduction (4 stars)<br />Chicago introduces themselves lyrically and musically with a stately groove.  Switching tempo and melody and with trumpet and guitar solos this song is a wonderful sampler of the then new awesom Chicago sound.<br /><br />Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is? (4 stars)<br />Starts with free form piano solo which turns with horns into a catchy swing time melody.  Like \\"A Day In the Life\\" by The Beatles and \\"Lunch Break: Peak Hour\\" by The Moody Blues the lyrics question the values behind the struggles of everyday life but here with, perhaps, a stronger dose of 60s protest perspective.  This pop tune is but one example of the many great pop tunes that Chicago would make with the sound captured previously by The Beatles \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\".<br /><br />Beginnings (5 stars)<br />Strumming guitar sets the pace and anticipation seems ever present until this song resolves into its long, glorious progressive jam.  Horn solos, percussion gradually added, then the chorus:<br /><br />It's only the beginning<br />Of what I want to feel forever<br /><br />The song dissolves into a percussion after party...awesome!  One of the best celebratory songs ever made.  For me this song is symbolic of the development of progressive rock at the time out of the great changes that pop and rock were going through which are, in turn, symbolized to a great extent by The Beatles (whose song \\"In The End\\" from the same year compliments this Chicago tune in my mind even as it signals the end of their influence as a band on the same music scene).<br /><br />Questions 67 and 68 (4 stars)<br />A fanfare openning with the guitar climbing up and around the horns.  Another great stately groove with the piano marking time.  A great horn section solo through the middle of this song.  The whole song seems like a kind of prose poetry love song.<br /><br />Listen (4 stars)<br />Long, long guitar note starts this one.  Then the funky bass line, hard rocking guitar and more great horns.<br /><br />Poem 58 (3 stars)<br />Oddly shaped song starts with a guitar strumming to set the pace.  Then an extende guitar solo which is melodic enough to keep my interest.  I find long improvisation jams to loose musical value to my ear over time, but this song narrowly escapes that.  Also, this may be due to the fact that the song changes gears half way through into a sassy guitar with horns thing.  A song that first seems like it will be a pure instrumental finds some vocals.  Overall this is some kind of awkward but interesting guitar poem.<br /><br />Free Form Guitar (2 stars)<br />Inventive guitar feedback, but not something I enjoy for 6+ minutes.  This song would go down better for me if it were contained in a more musically pallatable context.<br /><br />South California Purples (4 stars)<br />Super cool bluesy rock with a hard enough guitar riff to get me going.  Commanding horns tell the story in no uncertain terms.  Chicago sneaks in a brief Beatles melody followed by a riff that could have been heard in a Black Sabbath concert.  Then they wrap up with this awesome song's great head-bopping melody.<br /><br />I'm A Man (4 stars)<br />Percussion instruments come in first this time, us guys like to hit things together.  I'm not too familiar with the original version of this song, but I definitely like this Chicago version of the ultimate \\"man song\\".  Great drum solo in the middle and great guitar too.<br /><br />Someday (4 stars)<br /><br />Prologue, August 29, 1968<br />Recording of a crowd in protest<br /><br />Someday (August 29, 1968)<br />Hopeful message in the midst of political turmoil; great sense of the activism of the day through horns that herald either war or peace...you decide.<br /><br />Liberation (3 stars)<br />I love how this song starts out but it moves through most of its 14 minutes with ajam session that is more jam than melodic.  Perhaps this kind of music is better appreciated on the live stage.  After the chaos and war section there is a nice recovery of hopeful horns which builds momentum towards the climax.  Almost there is a reprise and I think a full reprise would have helped me appreciate this song more.  Still great musicians and a great band make this song interesting.<br /><br />Album:<br />Whoa!  At the dawn of the age of progressive rock we have a band that incorporated many of the instruments of the orchestra into its regular line up.  I know of no other band like Chicago.  Besides great songs, the variety of songwriters make this album a rich source of pop, rock and progressive music.<br /><br />MP3 recommendation:<br /><br />Essential (5 stars)<br />1.

0307454541|3.0|I found this novel well paced and very well written - quite a page turner. But there are not enough reviews warning unsuspecting readers of the theme, which is my only reason for writing this review. Be warned, the particular brand of evil depicted here is stomach turning psychopathic type evil. I couln't put down the book once I started it but did have a lingering queasy feeling for a few days after finishing it. If you are used to a strong thread of one on one violence by all means get this book - it's well crafted and enjoyable in that sense. But if you don't generally read this genre, and are put off by \\"silence of the lambs\\" type of imagery, think twice.
B002BFBAUG|1.0|This movie put me to sleep, literally.  I tried to watch it 3 times in one day and fell alseep twice on it.  The third time watching it I made it about fifty minutes in without a single laugh. Why is this called a comedy?  Seemed like a horribly written drama to me.  And I enjoy drama, but this was poorly written, with bad characters, and a bad plot.  Nothing happens, except you falling asleep.  Stay away unless you want to be bored. Oh, and if your getting the Blu Ray, it doesnt look like anything special.

The plot is somewhat shallow, but there is a very cool villian and a good supporting cast helping Hellboy along the way.  If it had a better plot, I'd probably give it 5 stars.<br /><br />The BluRay Transfer is great!  Looks and sounds amazing on a 1080P TV.  Better transfer than a lot of the others.
B0007OY2P8|2.0|I was also unhappy with this version of Northanger Abbey and added to my disappointment was when I found  that SIDE B was blank!
B00284BNKC|4.0|This movie was original to say the least for it.  Crossing three stories of different addictions rolled into one big intertwining plot.  Definately entertaining, but also heartbreaking.  The movie slowly turns into a very depressing display as you get closer and closer to the end.  If you like happy endings, stay away from this one!  As much as I enjoyed the movies acting, writing, and premise, I don't think it has any replay value.  A good rental if anything. Thank god Im not addicted to drugs!!!
B0013FDM7E|2.0|The beginning was strong but it did not maintain the suspense as the movie continued. Over all I did not like the film. Will Smith's movies always have great special effects, but they seem plastic to me. I did not like computer generated super man zombies for instance. The Last Man On Earth, from the 1950's is a much darker movie with it's child burning pits!  However the Vampires were cheesy and is in black and white. Check out Omega Man, from the 1970's for a stronger movie. A lot less special effects but a much stronger performance. Best of all check out the book, I am Legend. It is a dark masterpiece and will break your heart.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I first watched Serenity when it originally came out on DVD.  Having never seen the television series Firefly, I thought the movie was good, not great, and dismissed it as an average sci fi movie.  With that being said I have since watched the series Firefly and then watched the movies once more.  Firefly takes place prior to Serenity, and sets up the entire premise for the movie.  More over, the movie gives you closure to the very inconclusive season of Firefly.  In my opinion, Firerly was meant to be at least a 3 season series, but was unfortunately cancelled after only one.  Thank god for Serenity, giving an already amazing story closure, along with beautiful special effects, all the original cast of Firefly, definately pick this one up, but only after you pick up the Firefly series!!!!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I've had the VHS tape version of Delicate Sound of Thunder for many years, and have just watched the DVD of Pulse.    It's absolutely fantastic with just a few caveats. One song- \\"Great Gig in the Sky\\"- on DSoT absolutely wipes out the version offered on Pulse. This isn't the band's fault- they're far stronger and more engaged on Pulse- it's that the singers on Pulse, including Durga McBroom, oversing the song and completely miss the emotional core of it. The Delicate Sound of Thunder \\"Great Gig\\" is unforgettable, the Pulse \\"Great Gig\\" is vocal exercises that sound aggressive and show-offy. Also, the version of Sorrow on DSoT is more passionate.    That said- everything else on Pulse lays DSoT to waste, the way the earlier Great Gig does. There's no comparison at all. As the concert progresses, it just keeps getting better and better- the Pulse version of 'Money' is taut, riveting, stunning- Gilmour's guitar playing on that is astonishingly brash. Throughout, the band is laying it out with twice the passion and freshness of the rather lackadaisical DSoT version.    Even the backing musicians (with the exception of the Great Gig singers) are giving more- and most notably, where DSoT had a lively and personable sax player, Pulse has Dick Parry for the whole concert- yes, the original sax player who's on the record. Saxophone is an interesting instrument in that you can really tell who's behind it, and you definitely feel with every note that this is the 'right' sax player on this music, because just like Gilmour on guitar, this is the original guy on the records. It just feels good to have him there, it sounds so right.    Lastly- the mix and lighting are quite astonishing. The mix of the initial songs (the more recent Waters-less Floyd) caused my cat to freak out and cry and protest continuously, because my house turned into a Floyd show and my very decent subwoofer was putting out continuous giant stadium subsonics at super-high levels- this combined with the stratospheric highs was enough to convince my cat that the world was ending. When we got into the Dark Side material, it improved- it's startling to hear how the subsonic rumbles of that era (on the sound effects recordings) are nothing compared to present day capabilities- and then by the encores, we were back to the full thunder of a stadium and kitty panic again. Another interesting quality of the mix is it sounds breathtakingly loud even when at reasonable volumes, and is unusually clear. This is a very good speaker test DVD.    The lighting is basically DSoT only more so- the extent and variety of lighting at this show is simply astonishing. There's quite a lot of blinding white light, and every imaginable other sort, a giant mirror ball, the aircraft landing lights at the base of the stage now can spell words and symbols- it's just impossible overkill. There are wonderful visuals like when the mirrored ball goes on, shafts of lasers transfixing the stadium at all angles (and strangely thick for lasers, yet the beams don't widen)- pretty much the ultimate lightshow. There's the screen, and then the backdrop to the whole stage also works as a screen, and so on...    Thoroughly recommended. Now, how about the DVD for Delicate Sound of Thunder- just so I can have that Great Gig instead of this one?
0385504225|4.0|While many have said that this book was redundant of Brown's other infamous Robert Langdon books, you have to keep in mind that he has developed a very successful formula for his conspiracy theory thrillers.  The overall structure is similar to his prior novels, but the subject of the Freemasons is a departure from the more controversial topics previously addressed.  I have a bit more appreciation for the European settings, but the depiction of Washington DC was very enlightening in its architectural, historical and symbolic descriptions.  The novel is well paced and the suspense is very well done.  The ending was somewhat anticlimactic, but I liked the issues of science and the power of the human mind that were addressed.  If you take it at face value and enjoy the ride, it is a fun book.
B002NHBNWW|3.0|I watched this show to kill an hour of my day waiting to go out.  It wasn't a bad show but then it wasn't anything wow either.  Nothing original.  Nothing.  All of this has been done before and the lack of originality or interesting development of characters from any other teen show about vampires or aliens trying to fit in.  I didn't have time to review the show right after I watched it and have forgotten most of the dialogue.  I don't think there was anything particularly witty about the writing either.  I may watch the pilot again to review it fairly. I'm not expecting to watch this show episodes, or True Blood too bloody and spun off gay rights humor, or Twilight which I found to be almost an exact spin off of Roswell, the reluctant alien show, and the unlikely attraction for bloodsuckers is too highly inconceivable to me for that matter.  I'm not a huge vampire admirer obviously but if I'm watching at all it's because there is something more to the show than lust for blood.  I did think Interview with the Vampire was a classic.  The Gothic soap opera from the 60'-70's, Dark Shadows had some originality to its classic horror themes and kept my interest in spite of the low budget productions.  I'm looking forward to the new feature production starring Johnny Depp as Barnabas Collins, the original reluctant vampire.  It may turn out to be the greatest vampire story of all time.
0307387178|2.0|Wasnt a big fan of the way it was written or the story it self.
0399215921|2.0|The book was in great condition!  However, it didn't tell me how little the book was and when I got it in the mail it was very tiny.  Too tiny for all 26 of my kids in the class to see.  Maybe mention if the book is small or not next time??
B002O4JAV0|5.0|Without a doubt, Man on the Moon: The End of Day deserves album of the year. Kid Cudi's diverse musical talents make this concept album refreshingly enlightening to hear. All of the collaborations only make it better. (Ratatat and MGMT specifically) I haven't stopped listening to this cd for the past week and have started buying his mixtapes as well. Stoner or not, great album.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|You don't wanna miss this! Super talented, genius and absolute original composer and multi-intrumentalist Steven Wilson with other some of the best musicians on the planet worked on this surreal work of art. For whatever reason, some of the tracks reminded me of early Black Sabbath stuff with a lot more complexity and details of a full atmospheric nirvana. It leaves you speechless! It's haunting, unnerving, sad, melancholic and I can't get enough of it! I really wish that Steven would continue to make some more music like this and release them as his solo projects in the future. Don't let this rare gem remain lost deep in the sea of the usual garbage that most mistake as music. This is the real music. The only requirement, you have to be an attentive listener. It's great the 1st time, but as the most stuff by Steven, they only get better and better through time, so rinse and re-listen! You would never be bored or tired by his music. So, without further a due, I recommend you to get this as soon as you possibly can. Happy listening and keep listening.........................!
0385504225|1.0|This is not the worst of Dan Brown's books, and I've read them all, but it's pretty bad. It has the worst ending (a long, protracted, boring ending) of any book I've ever read.
B001TI3OFA|5.0|Out of all of the books I read, this is the one that I consider to be most influential in my business life. A classic that almost every MBA student must read, \\"Getting to Yes\\" has shown me a way between a \\"hard-nose\\" negotiation and a \\"soft-style\\" relationship sparing negotiation styles. The answer, the authors contend is to always engage in the Principle Based Negotiation. Key rules that I have gleened from the book are:   1. Separate the PEOPLE from the Problem   2. Focus on INTERESTS not Positions   3. Invest in OPTIONS for Optimum Gain   4. Insist on Using Objective CRITERIA    These four maxims have served me well every time I am mindful enough to use them.     The book also goes into the challenging situations when others try to manipulate you to get their ends. It is a key read for any executive or anyone who has argued about where to go out to dinner... This is a book that I always try to have 5 copies of, in case I want to give it to someone who can really use it ;-)
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Although the book downloaded at midnight on release day I spent 2 days finishing Kathy Griffin's new book. Gossip just won out. Then I got to tear into the Dan Brown book, The Symbol. Although not as good at The Divinci Code (that is a monster to try and follow up with) I found the book intriguing, somewhat fun to read. It kept me interested enough that when I was off to an Emmy Party to watch the show I wanted to listen to it with the Text To Speach option. Turns out the publisher had their issues and chose to keep this option off. (NOTE TO PUBLISHER: the text to speach will never replace a person who does a great reading. The text to speach is adequate for me to listen to for 25 minutes as I travel to a friends house. Past that if I wanted to hear the whole thing I would have bought the audio version. Quit feeling threatened. Start looking at it as a suplimentation to the book and nothing more.).<br /><br />I can say I am glad I only paid $9.99 for the book though. I look forward to Dan Brown's next book now that he took a huge leap off the cliff of producing something after his monster hit.
1569242739|5.0|I have had this book for about one year now and think it is one of the best baking books out there. First of all I am a real baker; I even make my pancakes and biscuits from scratch. Never a box mix here. What is great about this book is you have all the ingredients at your finger tips.  No need to search out unusual or hard to find ingredients.  Yes some say it is not healthy but then again I have been served healthy vegan baked goods and you can keep them! Most taste like dirt, like the pumpkin pie my brother bought at Whole Foods last Thanksgiving. Yuck! What this book does is taking traditional old world recipes and makes them vegan and they taste as good as the original recipes.  The chocolate cake and chocolate frosting (I have been making for years called Pits cake) is better than any chocolate cake out there. The wedding cookies and lemon bars are our favorites. I can't keep a plate of these goodies in my house for more than one day. This book is amazing and I am not vegan but there are a few people in my close circle who are and that prompted me to buy this book. Best money spent on a vegan book so far.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Plenty of reviews tell you about this fine book.  I am a real fan of Walter Mosley and his cultural approach to writing.  Larsson similarly writes in the Swiss culture.  Refreshing.  Great mystery.  Nice twists of culture, industry education, intrigue, sex, and mores.  I bought his other book, and probably will be wishing he did more before he died.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not knowing what to expect, I downloaded \\"The Hunger Games\\" on my Kindle to fill the hours while traveling from Atlanta to San Fransisco.  What I didn't realize that that I was about to enter a world that is foreign to me - yet entirely plausible.  I was hooked from the first few pages.  I encountered one cool teenage girl who has followed in her fathers footsteps and now provides for the rest of the family.  She has settled into a relationship with another competent young male who mutually discovers that 'together' they are stronger that the sum of their parts.  Then the Hunger Games are explained and our protagonist doesn't disappoint.    After my investment in their well being is over (read - totally absorbed in readying the outcome of the book)I am left satisfied - and hungry for more.  More please!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|A great journey through Earth's amazing landscape.  You will see the most amazing animals and witness unbefore seen images.  The images are spectacular and the information is excellent.  You will never view the Earth the same again.  Truly a MASTERPIECE!!!!!
1594200823|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.  It is very entertaining, riveting, discusses very important topics, has brought these troubling issues in agriculture to the mainstream...all in a very clever and well written way.    I am grateful for Michael Pollan for doing this, for he may be spurring a revolution in agriculture.  This is good.    But I cannot give him five stars.  I cannot because of his dismissiveness of veganism as an option to the suffering, waste and ugliness of animal agriculture.    Michael Pollan did not go into the issue of veganism deeply in any way at all.  He dismisses it because it seems in contrast to our anthropological and evolutionary roots.    If he wanted to...he could have gone deeper.  If he had, and maybe asked some of the millions of vegetarians in this country and numerous groups, he would have learned how it is indeed more than possible to live without animal products.  Not only not live, but thrive.  But he didn't bother because of his own blindness and personal preference.  He simply did not *want* to go there because he himself isn't ready to give up meat.    Or if he went deeper, he would see that many spiritual traditions of the world said \\"do not kill\\" and they didn't mean just humans. Or he'd see that there have been vegetarian cultures in the past that did fine.  Or maybe he would've come across the idea that maybe we were not meant to live as cavemen...that part of our evolution IS going vegetarian.      He simply did not do the issue justice.  That is wrong considering if more people were vegan, there would be less horrible animal intensive agriculture, less killing, less waste, less global warming...yet he ignores it as a viable option.    The more I think about it, the more I cannot believe someone of his stature, his intelligence, his town (an area where there are tons of vegans...how could he miss them?) could be so blind...but he is.  He is all intellectual but missing something...um like, ethics and *feelings* thattell you that killing is wrong and disturbing. It is too bad he allowed his personal preferences get in the way of telling the whole truth.      There is another book out called \\"Eating Animals\\".  In this book, the author is more comprehensive about the issue and does not dismiss the plant based diet as, at least one of the solutions.  Eating a plant based diet is not only a strong choice...but it is the best choice as it not only says \\"no\\" to factory farming and industrial agriculture but stops the waste of food energy for meat and stops the killing entirely.
0385504225|3.0|I have read the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons and now, The Lost Symbol. The quality has been declining steadily. The Lost Symbol has lots of excitement and is an interesting read until you get lost in the details and the incredibly long and worthless ending. To hammer home that thoughts and 'soul' have mass and can control things is OK in science fiction but it too far out to make this a complete and thrilling 'read.' I won't say more because the other reviews cover the same thing in detail. I'm familiar with freemasonry so that part is OK but enthusiastically overplayed.
B00004W221|4.0|Predictable but moving nonetheless. Jerry Goldsmith's score helps, and Sean Astin puts in a 5-star performance. Not as dark--nor as great, ultimately--as Hoosiers (also by director David Anspaugh).<br /><br />The weakest part of the movie to me was the romantic interest (the booster club girl).<br /><br />Might as well get this \\"Special Edition\\" (2000) over the later \\"Deluxe Edition\\" (2003).<br /><br />On a personal note, I met Ara Parseghian at a charity dinner. I always thought that Jason Miller (who plays Ara in the movie) looked a lot more like Joe Paterno!<br /><br />My favorite line from the movie?<br />\\"...It' ain't gonna never happen!\\" (Charles S. Dutton)
B00005JMXX|5.0|A surprisingly effective mainstream disaster film in the mould of some well-loved classics (Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno, etc) which doesn't stray far from the tried and tested formula but does nevertheless manage to feel inventive and modern...  A good disaster film humanizes a tragedy by focusing on a small but disparate group of characters who are imperilled, and to whom we are required to form some sort of emotional attachment. When the disaster is on a relatively small scale (people trapped in burning tower, or upturned boat) this is easy enough, but as Emmerich seems to specialise in global destruction, it can be a more difficult formula to pull off. Independence Day struggled to present the viewer with anything very much to care about, with a motley assortment of two dimensional characters who never really had a chance to rise above the ridiculous plot and relentless action.  TDAT is definitely more adult in its approach. It has a \\"message\\" and if the science has been 'tweaked' a little to suit a two hour film, then so be it. (Let's face it, watching a film which realistically depicts the scale of climate change would not be high on anyone's list of fun nights out.) I think he does a good job of dramatising the issues in a manner which does not seriously undermine the film's green credentials.  This is helped by using the great Ian Holm to lend gravitas to some of the sciency stuff. It's a shame that Adrian Lester, one of the UK's finest actors, wasn't given a meatier role, but it's still refreshing to see a depiction of working climatologists which doesn't stereotype them as nerdy scientists with no inner life. It's also a film which at least pays lip service to there being life outside the US, with a number of scenes in Europe, and the aforementioned British actors talking about Manchester United in their Scottish hidey-hole.  Which brings us back to the imperilled characters who inhabit the core of the film. For every scene in which nature wreaks havoc on a sizeable chunk of the earth (and credit due here for some truly outstanding special effects), there should be an emotional counterpoint. Dennis Quaid gives a very solid, charismatic performance as the father who mounts a polar-style expedition along the Eastern coast to reach his son. It's an interesting comparison with the Jeff Goldblum role from ID4 (also playing the \\"scientist who wasn't listened to and whose focus now is to save his family\\") and really points up the more fully fleshed out character in this film, and also the better performance. The scenes with Jake Gyllenhaal trapped in the library are also watchable, sprinkled with enough clever moments amongst the \\"as if?!\\" clichés to keep one's interest. The amusing debate over which books to burn between the bespectacled liberal and the female student (\\"Nietzsche?! Not Nietzsche!\\") was just the sort of quirky scene which elevated the film above predictable schlock.  Some of the minor characters didn't do it for me - the hobo, who I guess was some sort of cypher for the less materialistic lifestyle we should be aspiring to (the simple life of the non-consumer ultimately rewarded with survival) and the dying boy patient (a little unnecessary when a whole hemisphere was about to be obliterated) both would have been more at home in Independence Day. The arrogance and ignorance of the vice president seemed very plausible, and his conversion-by-fire (or ice in this case) to accept the damage being done to the planet made for a dramatic large-scale conclusion to accompany the reconciliation of Quaid and son.  The odd scene here and there veered into cheesy action flick territory. There was, as someone else has pointed out here, really no need for the \\"Jurassic Park with wolves\\" scene. And the \\"chased along street by lethal icy wind\\" scene into which it segued struck me as being risible. Quick! Close the door, before the nasty weather kills you... But none of this detracted from the enjoyment.  Perhaps the most impressive achievement of TDAT is this it really did leave me with some memorable images - the ship stranded in the snow halfway up fifth avenue (or wherever it was), the icicles hanging down from the statue of liberty, the wall of water approaching manhattan, even some of the views of earth from space.  In summary (no pun intended), better than expected and therefore pretty good.
B001PR0YFS|4.0|While it isn't exactly an all-time classic, or even likely to be on a lot of \\"10 Best of the Year\\" lists, THE INFORMANT is a delightfully offbeat treat that showcases a truly award-worthy performance from Matt Damon.    THE INFORMANT, if told straight, could have come off as a low-stakes, \\"based on a true story\\" TV-movie.  Something that dryly detailed how one man, Mark Whitacre, decided to turn whistle-blower on his company, Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM).  A story of corporate corruption, one man's jumbled motives and the methods of the FBI in piecing together a case over a number of years.  Mildly interesting, but not too surprising.  \\"WOW, companies tries to engage in price-fixing??!?!  Who woulda thought?!?!\\"  That would have been my sarcastic reaction.    Instead, director Steven Soderbergh and writer Scott Burns apparently realized that they didn't have an inherently vital story on their hands.  But somehow, they were able to look at the surprising and twisty turns that Whitacre took in the real life case, and saw how what they really had was the stuff of a pleasant and original comedy.  And thus, THE INFORMANT manages to tell its little story of corporate corruption...and yet it is a comedy about one seemingly good-intentioned but nerdy scientist/corporate bigwig who ends up being befuddlingly complex.    Matt Damon embodies Whitacre.  He's not just playing against type (as someone like Brad Pitt will do in amiable but surface-level performances in films like BURN AFTER READING or INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS)...he is fully imagining this man.  While all his mannerisms (and his hilarious way of walking) initially seem just a bit over-the-top...the result is to give us a weak, sweaty man who seemingly is simply irate by the actions of his bosses and wants the FBI to do something about it.  He's willing to brave wearing a wire.  He's willing to steal documents.  His wife supports him.  The FBI agents who work with him for years tolerate his idiosyncrasies because he seems like such a good guy (and he's giving them good material).  He is a brilliant dimwit...a great scientist who doesn't seem to always understand his more \\"human\\" interactions.  And we like him so much, that when the plot takes some unexpected turns...we cannot help but be amazed and bemused...much like his FBI operators.      I'm deliberately going light on the plot details, because, this movie is like an onion, and you deserve to peel it back layer by layer for yourself.      While Damon alone makes this movie worth seeing (and that's not something I've ever said about a Matt Damon movie)...it is greatly aided by some terrific supporting performances.  Soderbergh has assembled a great cast of some terrific comic actors, and given them all straight roles to play.  Just as we expect Matt Damon to play straight with us, we expect people like Tony Hale or Patton Oswald to be goofy and funny.  Yet all play against type.  Hale plays an attorney.  Oswald is a straight-laced bureaucrat.  There are other cameos that you'll enjoy, particularly if you've spent much time watching RENO 911...several of that show's recurring minor actors show up here.      Special mention to three actors.  Joel McHale plays one of the FBI agents assigned to Whitacre.  I had just seen him the night before doing an excellent, dryly funny turn in the new sitcom \\"Community.\\"  Then the next afternoon, I see him playing perfectly straight in THE INFORMANT, and doing a very credible job.  I see bright things for this guy.  Scott Bakula plays the very straight-arrow FBI agent who first gets to know Whitacre, and it was a nice treat to see him again in a role that allows him to shine a bit.  It's a calm, understated performance that nonetheless conveys all the thrill of the \\"chase\\" that his character feels and all the bewilderment when things change for the strange.  And finally, Melanie Lynskey does a great job as Whitacre's supportive wife.  I'll be honest, I didn't think I knew who she was, but she was so good, I had to check imdb.  Turns out, she co-starred opposite Kate Winslet all those years ago in HEAVENLY CREATURES, and was fabulous.  I'll certainly be taking note of her in the future.    Soderbergh films THE INFORMATION in the colors of the late `70s / early `80s.  The whole movie feels vaguely almond & burnt orange hued.  Not just the clothes, but everything.  The period detail is terrific.  The story seems to unfold at a leisurely pace, but it is filmed and edited to move along briskly...so that you never feel bored.  And Matt  Damon's hair and makeup are terrific, particularly at the end of the film.    The film is not a laugh-fest...it's more of a smile and chuckle movie than a laugh-out-loud experience.  But it has a good-natured tone that I appreciated.  It's a minor movie, to be sure...but everyone gave it their best effort and I believe the best possible comic movie about the whistle-blowing of Mark Whitcare was the result.  Kids will hate this film, but intelligent adults really should see it.
B0000AUHOH|1.0|In my quest to view all the Star Trek movies, I had the somewhat misfortune of seeing them in this order: First Contact, Insurrection, Nemesis, The Voyage Home, Star Trek (2009), The Voyage Home (in full this time), Wrath of Khan<br /><br />So then I restarted again with the first to last.<br /><br />What was so horrible about \\"The Final Frontier\\"?<br /><br />Standing on its own, I thought it was a pleasant enough movie, but it suffered from a severe lack of real drama.

B002ELM5HY|5.0|I am a thirty odd year fan of Mark Knopfler, and had the great honor and pleasure of meeting Mark last time he toured, just after Kill to Get Crimson. What a gentleman.  It would appear that with \\"Get Lucky\\", Mark addresses the world he observes today, as well as reflects on whee he came from.  Knopfler loves to play with consummate musicians, and in that setting, sets himself loose. Richard Bennett's guitar playing is nuanced and delicate, a perfect foil for Mark's poignant playing and singing.  \\"Cleaning My Gun\\" is a wry look at life, great guitar licks and an addictive groove. The total \\"feel good\\" vibe of \\"Get Lucky\\" is a great antidote to today's worries. \\"Monteleone\\" -- what a gem in a waltz mode about making magic from wood.  And on \\"We Will Remember Them\\" and \\"Piper to the End\\" Mark breaks out the emotion --shades of Brothers In Arms.  This is a poignant album, easy to listen to, with so much feeling and detail -- I'd call it a labor of love.
B002GZQY6Q|3.0|From reading all the five star reviews I'm convinced that if Steve Wilson hung a microphone and recorded air for thirty minutes most fans would call it a masterpiece. This is a good disc but I don't hear anything groundbreaking or different from previous releases. The disc flows well but it doesn't sound like one composition. The tracks that stand out for me are - \\"Great Expectations\\",  \\"Time Flies\\", \\"Circle of Manias\\" and \\"I Drive the Hearse\\".  And what's the deal with \\"Drawing the Line\\"? The cheesy (Muse like) chorus destroys what could have been a cool song.     For me, the audio quality is somewhat muddy and nowhere close to the audio perfection of \\"Stupid Dream\\" or \\"In Absentia\\". The cymbals specifically, don't have the clear shimmer they usually do and the decay cuts out to quick. The kick and snare are perfect.     I'm still not sure about disc two. I like \\"Flicker\\" but the rest sounds like filler to me. Overall, this is a good disc and this band is a gem compared to most offerings out there. However, if you're new to PT you may want to start elsewhere.
0141023570|5.0|John Steinbeck, a name that will remain in the literary history books forever. His writing is broadly criticized and marveled at; he was one of the most controversial writers of his time. Despite the dark veil he often wrote behind there are many gems of wisdom to be had about the way life was, and is. I have read other books of his such as: East of Eden, The Pearl, and The Red Pony. I am no stranger to his style or his brilliance, both of which make the beautiful tale Of Mice and Men all that it is.   Life was hard for the wandering laborers of California, maybe more so for George and Lennie. Although both are good men at heart they find stiff opposition in the eyes of men who cannot overlook the fact that Lennie is different. With the strength of a bull and the mind of a child Lennie does not see life the way most men do. He travels with George, who is tasked with the endless job of protecting Lennie from himself and a cruel society. They lead a simple existence, traveling from farm to farm working as laborers to keep their place on the edge of time.  But even this misfit pair have their own ideas, they share the American dream and a longing to be their own masters. Standing between them and their goal though are the cold eyes of a world that has hardened itself and embraced greed along with arrogance. Despite Lennie's ever good intentions he always manages to get himself into trouble, not because of faults of his own but because of the differences of others. And ultimately it is Lennie's fear of getting in trouble that leads to their downfall.   In this novel there is nothing that I can complain about. Steinbeck's laid back sense that he creates when storytelling is almost always present in this novel. This is not to say that the book will bore you, quite to the contrary, it will reach out to you and envelope you in the plot and familiarize you with the characters until they are old friends of yours. This book is short, only about 100 pages, however that is all that is needed to tell a tale that will lead you on an incredible journey, a journey through the territories of the human soul: joy, love, excitement, and finally sorrow. This book is a good read for anybody, and is an exceptional read for those that can grasp the underlying brilliance in this seemingly simple story.   To say it all in a word, bravo. Bravo to one of the best writers there ever was or will be. I am honored to award this book a five star rating, in fact I consider it a privilege to be able to bestow my opinion of this masterpiece on others. And I urge whoever may read this simple review, Of Mice and Men is a book that will try all human emotion and in the end leave you with much more than you started with. Sometimes like putting a pet to sleep, all that can saved from the best of friendships is the dignity of what there once was. This novel demonstrates better than ever that in life there are mice and there are men.
0385504225|2.0|The book was ok, but the last several chapters killed it. On and on about the same thing, over and over, boring and boring. If I had wanted to study philosophy, etc, etc, etc, I would read a different book. Too much! too much! too much!!!! Give me a break! In the neck!
0064407667|4.0|A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS is a 13-book series for children written by Daniel Handler, under the pen name \\"Lemony Snicket.\\"  The series has become a huge hit among kids in the 8-14 age bracket, second in popularity only to Harry Potter.  I decided to read the first entry on a whim, and found it much more enjoyable that I expected.<br /><br />THE BAD BEGINNING is very short (about 80 pages) and is written in the style of a dark fairy tale.  The subject matter is quite morbid, involving three recently orphaned children who are forced to live with a very distant relative, a sinister-looking gentleman named Uncle Olaf.  Almost immediately, it becomes clear to the children that Olaf is a horrible man who is only interested in getting his hands on their sizable inheritance.<br /><br />Despite the seemingly tragic subject matter, THE BAD BEGINNING is actually quite funny.  If you have a dark, dry sense of humor, then you will most likely enjoy what author Handler does here.  He writes the novel in an exaggerated, formalistic style that continually warns the reader of terrible things ahead.  Fortunately, the children are both plucky and lovable, and do an excellent job of fighting their way out of trouble.  The end result is a book that is both cleverly done and quite entertaining.<br /><br />While I wouldn't put THE BAD BEGINNING in the same classic category as Roald Dahl or CS Lewis or JK Rowling, it's still a pleasure to read, a book that adults will appreciate as much as their children.  Highly recommended.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Having just spent the weekend on this novel, I'm sorry to say it left me disappointed.  I was curious enough about what would happen to Robert Langdon to keep turning the pages, and the puzzle-solving was fun as in \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" but there was too much detail in the historical references, and too much repetition of the main philosophical theme.  Additionally, the main villain was less interesting and too one-dimensional for most of the story as compared to the villain in \\"Angels and Demons.\\"  I enjoyed the plot twist regarding the villain at the climax of the story, but I had almost given up caring since he seemed so unrealistic.  Furthermore, it was too easy to figure out where the mysterious place Langdon was being taken to blindfolded was near the end of the book.  While I enjoyed the insights into Masonic history and our founding fathers' beliefs, the ending lacked the dramatic impact of \\"The DaVinci Code.\\"  I couldn't help connecting one scene in the book to one I'd already seen in \\"National Treasure.\\"  Too bad, and a curious coincidence.  Overall, Brown has done his research, perhaps overwell, and there are some exciting moments in this story.  Yet many of the characters are unbelievable, and Robert Langdon, though resilient and brilliant as always, played too much of the sceptic-turned-optimist and not enough of the academic sleuth-turned-adventurer a la Indiana Jones as in Brown's previous works.

B001I0T92Q|5.0|This thing is amazing! It works perfectly, and makes it so you can have a nearly endless amount of memory for your PSP. Don't be scared about it being foreign; it works totally fine, and you don't need instructions or anything. Also, with the PSP go coming out, more and more games will be realized on the Playstation Network so you don't want to be caught with some dinky, tiny, low-capacity Memory Stick! Keep in mind that this product has NO ACTUAL MEMORY OF IT'S OWN, and that you need to buy (up to) two microSD or microSDHC cards to add memory to the system. It's a converter in this way.
0812580346|2.0|I didn't hate it.... but I surely wouldn't recommend it to anyone.    The author put a kid in the book (7 year old) now I have no problem with kids in my book, if they act like kids.  The author had this kid saying ridicules things that a 7 year old would never say.       Also he tried way to hard for a love story that FAILED miserably.  When two characters in the story touched hands (guy and girl mind you) he actually describe the seconds their hands were touching as delicious .... PUKE!       I give it two stars because he got right to the flash-forward.     I really hope the TV show is better than this book.

0316066524|1.0|I just hated it.  That's all.  I have NEVER given up on a book before, but after a few hundred pages, it just wasn't worth it. It just droned on & on.  I am a dedicated reader, and I have diverse tastes.  I read dense histories, novels, scifi, scolarly tomes, etc. - If I feel a book has ANYTHING to offer me, I will tough it out and get through it (Ralph Ketcham's treatment of James Madison was dry like an 80 year old nun, but informative, so I stuck with it)This book was uninformative, droning and seemed to serve no purpose other than for the author to show that yes, he probably is smarter than I am.  It was supposed to be funny, but at best there were some wryly amusing moments.  However, I feel for David Foster Wallace, because reading it was so painful that I cannot imagine the tedium of WRITING this book...<br /><br />I just... hated... this... book...<br /><br />New rule - In a couple hundred pages if I don't care about the charachters, plot, or \\"message\\" of a book, I'm done.  Not only do I want my $ back (that'll be the day) I also want the 2 evenings back tha I wasted trying desperately to like this book.  I keep reading accolades about this book like Wallace is the next great author of the English language.  If that's the case I'm learning Spanish.  English will officially have nothing left to offer.<br /><br />Why did I buy it?  Because I bought books by Christopher Moore & Terry Pratchett & Amazon thought that they were similar.  They're not.  Those other guys are FUNNY, and thier books can be read in a day, and you - get this - actually ENJOY the process of reading them!
B00065MDSQ|5.0|King Crimson's \\"Red\\" (1974) features the core trio of Robert Fripp (guitar, mellotron), John Wetton (bass, vocals), and Bill Bruford (drums). They are accompanied by guest musicians Ian McDonald, Mel Collins, David Cross, Robin Miller, and Marc Charig. After this the band broke up for 7 years, but what a way to go out! Dark, ominous, and un-relentingly powerful, \\"Red\\" was in many ways their strongest release since the famous debut \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\" (1969). Over those five years they had changed so much.    The first 4 studio albums (\\"Court\\", \\"Poseidon\\", \\"Lizard\\", \\"Islands\\") are great, but sound rather dated today. Lyricist Pete Sinfield wrote like Tolkien, and liked medieval imagery with arcane twists and turns. When paired with acoustic guitar and flute it comes off kind of hippie-ish. They are fascinating, and contain remarkably advanced musicianship - but they are very much a product of their times. Starting with \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\\", the sound changed completely. \\"Starless And Bible Black\\" and \\"Red\\" complete a trilogy that still holds up as contemporary and fresh. The reason was a complete change in personnel.    All 3 feature the simpler lyrics of Richard Palmer-James. Wildman percussionist Jamie Muir came on board for \\"Larks' Tongues\\", and Bruford gives him a lot of credit as a mentor who helped him loosen up. Larks also saw the addition of violinist David Cross. The fourth jewel in the crown was new singer John Wetton, whose smoky, evocative voice is one of the best in rock history. This version of King Crimson was less acoustic and more electric. By the time they recorded \\"Red\\" they were practically a heavy metal band.     From '81 to '84, King Crimson resurfaced for a few albums that sounded a lot like Talking Heads. After another long time off, they came back in '94 bearing more resemblance to Nine Inch Nails. They are still around with this harsher industrial sound. All these eras are good, but I'd say \\"Red\\" remains their penultimateachievement. That particular line-up of the band just can't be beat.
074322454X|4.0|This may be the first time I enjoyed the movie (the HBO miniseries) more than the book. \\"Band of Brothers\\" is a very straightforward record drawn from personal accounts from the paratroopers of E Company and other sources. Stephen Ambrose lacks the style and wit of Edmund Morris, the last author I read. However, many will prefer the simplicity of  Ambrose's  \\"just the facts\\" approach. I especially appreciated the personal detail he extracted in face to face interviews. He shares these very candidly. No punches pulled here. The reader is treated to the feeling that he is more than acquainted with the soldiers of E Company. The book includes interesting background and personal detail not included in the miniseries. A watching audience would view them as tedious. However, the book lacks the visceral impact of the visuals in the miniseries. My advice? Watch the miniseries AND read the book. They complement each other very well. Rating: 4 of 5
0316017922|2.0|My main problem with this book was that I just didn't understand where it was going. The cover claims to explain why some people succeed and others don't. Gladwell discusses why many professional hockey players are born between January and March; why professional musicians seem to have clocked 10,000 hours at their instruments by a particular age; why Asians traditionally score better in mathematics than Caucasians; why some of the richest computer programmers were born between 1953 and 1958.<br /><br />At the same time, Gladwell spends about 40 pages elaborating that richer children have more opportunities than poorer children. That seems neither like a radical thought, nor one that deserves that many pages. He devotes an entire chapter to plane crashes, saying that countries with cultures fostering individualism have fewer airline crashes. How this is measured, however, is never really discussed in-depth. Additionally, Gladwell seems to argue that it is individualism and ability to communicate that--more than any other factors--contribute to plane crashes.<br /><br />But where is Galdwell going with this book? Is he arguing that if you don't put 10,000 hours into studying, or practicing piano by the age of 15 then you're never going to become an academic or a musician? Why is the book called 'Outliers'? Who are the outliers? Are they the kids who go on to earn PhD's? All the book says is that kids who go to college frequently come from families with money. But, wouldn't it be more interesting to study the poor kids who still manage to get PhD's? Wouldn't THEY be the outliers? Okay, so there's a logical explanation for why 60% of hockey players are born before April--the age cut-offs for all leagues is January 1 (like the age cut-off for all grades in schools is August 1); but then, wouldn't it be fascinating to discuss the outlier of the hockey star born in September?<br /><br />Is Gladwell saying that how much a person succeeds is entirely pre-determined and out of their control? Or is he making excuses for a society that so desperately wants to hear them? And regardless of the non-specified point of the book, where does Gladwell get his statistics? Apparently foot-notes are something his society and social status didn't pass down to him as important. And what makes Gladwell an expert on history and sociology? He has a bachelor's degree in history (which in current society means he is qualified to run a french fry machine at Burger King), and he built his career as a science writer for the Washington Post (given the fact that his degree was NOT in science, one can only imagine the quality of those articles).<br /><br />Read this book if you're really curious--and if you are, get it at the library.he making excuses for a society that so desperately wants to hear them?

0439023483|5.0|Set sometime in the (distant?) future, the U.S. has been replaced by a new nation-state called Panem. Once a year, the totalitarian government demands a \\"tribute\\" of two youths from each of the twelve districts. They are sent to compete in the Hunger Games, a gladiatorial battle for resources designed to both entertain and intimidate the citizens.<br /><br />Katniss lives a hard-scrabble existence in the coal-mining district. She's an expert hunter who illegally poaches with her male friend Gale in the woods just outside their village. After the emotionally trying loss of her father and her mother's complete withdrawal, she is nearly solely responsible for the care of her younger sister Prim. When Prim is selected as the sacrifice, Katniss instantly volunteers to take her place. She and Peeta, the village baker's son, are sent to the Capitol. Katniss feels awful, as she considers Peeta a friend, but quickly forces herself to be pragmatic, hoping that someone else will kill Peeta first so that she doesn't have to.<br /><br />After receiving makeovers, and enjoying opulence in the Capitol for the first time in their lives, Peeta makes the startling revelation (on-air, no less) that he's always harbored feelings for Katniss. All too soon, they are forced into battle. While most of the contestants pick each other off quickly in a battle for supplies, Peeta and Katniss form an uneasy alliance. Katniss quickly assumes Peeta's declaration of love for her is a shrewd gambit on his part, in a desperate gamble to assure a winning spot for both of them. She quickly decides to \\"play along\\" for the cameras never dreaming that his feelings are genuine.  If she does survive, how long will she have to keep up the ruse? And how will she explain this to her not-quite boyfriend Gale back home?<br /><br />Although I had several moments where I had trouble suspending my disbelief, ultimately, I absolutely really enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down. It's a great blend of action, suspense and dystopia with just a touch of romance.just a touch of romance.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|unless you possess hands of steel or have the 'hippy hippy shakes,'  replacing the cd's in their slots is not a dangerous task. in fact, the inner slots are smoothly lined and one would have to go to significant lengths to scratch the disc.  two exceptions for using jewell cases would be \\"the white album' and \\"past masters\\" because it's difficult to remove the discs from their slots because of the double cd design; not very good!  but as for the single disc packaging, the cd comes out easily and goes back the same way.  imo,not an issue.  oh yeah, the music sounds darn good too!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Fell in love with Nathan Fillion's character in FIREFLY, Captain Malcolm Reynolds, and I'll be darned if he hasn't done it again. He really is quite talented, regardless of who he is at the moment: the insanely evil minister on BUFFY, the reluctant hero on FIREFLY, or the wise-cracking & charming writer on CASTLE, Fillion manages not only to pull it off, he makes it look easy.<br /><br />Joining police detective Kate Beckett played by Stana Katic solving murders, they make a totally implausible circumstance real and very entertaining. Cleverly written and impeccibly performed, the series has been wonderful so far. I'd been getting the episodes off iTunes but it has come to the point where I'm just giving up and buying the darn thing so my whole family can enjoy this wonderful television show.<br /><br />Just a word to the wise: see it now before the television \\"suits\\" cancel it, like they cancelled the incredible FIREFLY, like the BBC cancelled PRIMEVAL, like all the really great shows have been cancelled in the past.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show is simply hilarious. Our entire family gravitates to the screen whenever an episode is turned on. Sheldon's character steals the show at every turn.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Typical Dan Brown fare. If you liked his other stuff, you've already established yourself as a not-too-discriminating reader at least part of the time (no fault there), and you'll definitely love this because it delivers on more of the same code-cracking, ancient ritualizing, and religious/political pseudo-commentary.<br /><br />Books like this have their place - for me, that's the subway (on the iPhone Kindle app - because I wouldn't be caught dead showing an \\"Infinite Jest\\"-reading ridership the dust jacket of this book) - a place where concentration and deep thought are tricky and reading three pages at a time is just fine (I used to try to read Adorno and Walter Benjamin on the subway, but stopped because the paragraphs were just too lengthy for me to get through without distraction).<br /><br />But of course, there are thousands of books that fall between Dan Brown and David Foster Wallace on the spectrum of Readability and Worthwhile-ness (which goes from Readable to Ulysses on one axis, and Time-wasting to Worthwile on the other), so your money would be better spent on something in the Readable/Worthwhile quadrant, rather than the Readable/Time-wasting quadrant that The Lost Symbol occupies.<br /><br />More fun than The Lost Symbol: a book of cryptograms and word puzzles and brain teasers for $1.49 in the supermarket checkout line (or your grandmother's house).<br /><br />Less fun than The Lost Symbol: Stephanie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\" books.<br /><br />In closing: Holy Italics, Batman!
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown's long awaited and much anticipated book satisfied and disappointed at the same time.  If you can overlook the sometimes awkward writing and the didactic speeches towards the end, The Lost Symbol delivers a fast paced, action-packed narrative that entertains and hopefully (if all Dan Brown's clain in the beginning that all the art, monuments, rituals and organizations that exist in the book are real), educates.  Brown is at his best explaining symbols, rituals, secret societies and conspiracies.  He is at his worst describing characters and the mundane details of their everyday life.  Early in the book, our narrator tells us that our hero after his fifty laps at the university pool in the morning, is home around six when \\"he began his morning ritual hand-grinding Sumatra coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen.\\"  [...].    Brown, however, becomes more adept at describing other rituals.  Thank goodness.  He writes well when he is talking about the Freemasons, the Knight Templars and George Washington.  He explains art and symbolism well, he's just a little awkward when it comes to fictional characters.  It's like reading a scientific journal with a little bit of Harlequin Romance imagery thrown in to keep the reader interested, so if you can get past the awkwardness Brown can tell a good story.    WARNING: SPOILER ALERT    What I haven't decided, however, is if I like the author's deceptive manipulation of the writing to obscure the plot line.  If you're a detective novel enthusiast, you might probably figure out earlier in the book the true identity of the book's antagonist.  But if you examine the text, you will realize that the author gives you no basis for your suspicions, other than the hunch that such a vengeful spirit could only exist if the stakes were higher.  Dan Brown carefully weaves his words so we are constantly surprised by who's the evil one and who's in cahoots with him and why.  He also seems to take pleasure inmaking Robert Langdon the ultimate skeptic, and in the process, making him seem incredibly dim and actually, quite stupid.  The man who can speak multiple languages have a photographic memory and can solve the most unsolvable puzzles in the world sometimes acts like the victim in a teen horror movie.  No! Don't go in that door! Don't you know the killer is in there?  All this in the interest of moving the action along, I suppose, like just the purpose they serve in horror movies.      Robert Langdon poses as the ultimate Doubting Thomas, refusing to believe, unable to accept, and then suddenly, before our book ends, he is converted.  Though I do not know that it is a completely unbelievable ending for our hero, what I find difficult to dismiss is how much of this book Dan Brown's manifesto to get the right-wing Christians  to stop criticizing him from having his character proclaim in previous books that he did not believe in God.  Or their particular God.  Towards the end, the book becomes more and more theological in spirit.  I have no qualms in including a theological discussion in a work of fiction.  I am a big fan of Dante's Inferno.  Many great books (all if you believe Joseph Campbell's Hero with a Thousand Faces which I am sure Brown read and included its ideas in his book) have been written to wrestle with the idea of good versus evil and is there an ultimate good.  Dan Brown uses ideas from Plato, Socrates, Dante, Campbell, Jung and the list goes on and on.  But ultimately what I am interested in when I pick up Dan Brown is did he tell a good story?  I can see that a movie of this book will yet again be criticized for extremely long misplaced dialogues explaining philosophical teachings and scientific theories.  I can see two actors trying to discuss Noetic Sciences and Aristotle as they run away from bad guys down a long dark tunnel.  Movie possibilities aside, The Lost Symbol is still an entertaining book, one that I'm sure will provoke great interest inmany, many topics both religious and philosophical, and hopefully, a renewed interest to visit our great American capital and visit its fine if sometimes boring museums.

B00006F2TV|4.0|Recently, superhero films have been an extremely effective genre in Hollywood. It is undeniable that superhero films are the movies that endure the most hype these days. If made correctly, these kind of movies offer plenty of action, thrills, and character, while also being impressively designed and using some of the best special effects teams around. Bryan Singer's \\"X-MEN\\" was the movie that introduced the superhero film to the 21st century. It raised the bar so high, the audiences were astounded and it seemed like no other movie, superhero or otherwise, could surpass it. That bar has definitely been raised to new levels many times since then with films such as the spectacular \\"THE DARK KNIGHT\\" and, to a lesser extent, \\"IRON MAN\\". However, \\"SPIDER-MAN\\" is nothing to sneeze at either.   High school nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) lives with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). His next door neighbor happens to be the beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), whom Peter has loved since \\"before he even liked girls\\". Peter is also best friends with Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose dad is Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). Norman is overly ambitious with his company, Oscorp (which supplies weapons and special equipment to the military), and wants to give Harry everything that he never had in his younger days. One life-changing day, Peter's class goes on a field trip to Columbia University's Science Department. During the tour, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically enhanced \\"super-spider\\" that escaped from an exhibit. That night, Norman is testing one of his company's performance enhancers on himself. The experiment goes horribly wrong, and Norman becomes the incredibly strong yet viciously insane Green Goblin. Meanwhile, Peter has undergone a night of dizziness and a stomach ache due to the spider bite. In the morning, he finds that he also has gained heightened strength, agility, can spin webs from his wrists, climb walls, and a certain \\"spider-sense\\" to warn him of danger. Mary Jane and Peter become much closer friends, despite the fact that she is now dating Harry. She also thinks she loves Spider-Man after he saves her life twice. Goblin is suspicious of Spider-Man's true identity. He also feels threatened by Parker, but has not yet made the connection between the two. They finally square off in a fantastic showdown that is also one of the best scenes in the entire movie.   But, at the end of the day, \\"SPIDER-MAN\\" still has its faults. For example, what is Goblin's plan? We understand his revenge against the Quest Aerospace officials and the Oscorp board members, but what else is there? He has a personal vendetta against Spider-Man, but why? Just to write it off as him being insane is not sufficient. Up next is the cinematography during the scenes of Spider-Man swinging through the city. They play and look like a video game, with the camera seeming to be too distant and too close at the same time. The feeling of all the tension, fear, and confusion of his new powers is actually not felt at all; he acts more like a kid in a candy shop. Instead of keeping the camera a reasonable distance from him so we can see how he uses his surroundings to display his amazing powers, the camera is tight on him, right over his shoulder most of the time. Strangely, the cinematography for the action scenes is quite good. The only scene of this kind that works in this film is the ending, which was filmed with the Spyder-Cam. It was a very effective technique that was used for all the swinging and fighting scenes in \\"SPIDER-MAN 2\\", and I would assume it was used in #3 as well, but I haven't seen that one yet. As a matter of fact, everything in #2 is improved over #1. The acting, action pieces, dialogue, and especially the villain. Nevertheless, everything in this film still comes together reasonably well, with only a few drawbacks.

B0010X745K|5.0|This is a superior King adaptation, presenting a far bleaker vision of humanity than is normal for him, indeed at times this felt more like Cormac McCarthy except set in small-town Maine.<br /><br />What I liked best is the breakdown in social order and the slow unraveling of conventions and constraints of civilization within the grocery store, as the holy roller \\"believers\\" close their minds and whip up fears and hatred, until the mob extracts their vengeance on the \\"other\\"  -- the victim, the educated, the out-of-towner, the scapegoat, the rationalist, the scientist.  In this regard the humans are far scarier than the monsters.<br /><br />I also found the ending deeply profound and worthy of serious contemplation and debate.  Recalling anything from Victor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning to Gene Hackman at the end of Poseidon Adventure to Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, what we have at the end is a meditation on what the point of life is, and why and how we are to live it.<br /><br />Undoubtedly some will be put off by how it concludes, especially as to the father/son relationship, but I found it deeply stimulating.  The choices made by the protagonists, while tragic, left me engaged in thought and raised numerous philosophical issues that I am still trying to sort out.<br /><br />That's pretty good for a monster movie I think.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Origin of Symmetry is Muse's second album, and probably my favorite of theirs. As I type this right now, I am scrolling through and looking at the negative reviews. One says that Bellamy's voice is \\"rubbish\\", and that \\"he wants to be Jeff Buckley\\". I don't see the resemblance- the falsetto is just Bellamy's style. And that said, I think Bellamy has one of the best singing voices of recent times.<br /><br />Origin of Symmetry is definitely Muse at their peak, beginning with \\"New Born\\", which begins with a nightmarish piano riff you'd hate to hear in the dark while you're trying to sleep. Then more piano kicks in and Bellamy's soft vocals just help the song drift off. Then a totally [...] guitar riff kicks in and the band just explodes, the song soon turns into a kick-in-the-teeth metal song. Then the second track, \\"Bliss\\", which is Muse's best song, begins with a dreamy keyboard riff that makes you think of an island somewhere far away, then the rest of the band kick in and give us 4 minutes of pure kickass. \\"Hyper Music\\" cuts away from the soft, dreamy intros and just explodes into a great metal track.<br /><br />Song number 5, \\"Plug in Baby\\", is one of the best tracks on the album, and one of their biggest tracks ever. Sure the title is enough to make you cringe (to the point where your muscles tension up) but aside from the lame title, it's one hell of a rocker. \\"Micro Cuts\\" is Queen-esque Muse at work, and is just enough to make you claim this as their best album. THeir cover of \\"Feeling Good\\" is great too, and even makes an appearance in the recent Will Smith movie [[ASIN:B001QERPAM Seven Pounds]].<br /><br />In short, this may be their best album, and is totally an example of why, as the other reviewer says, \\"Art Rock Lives\\".
B001NLKT60|5.0|The first book may have started off a little slow, but this book took off running. I cannot wait to read the third book.
B001FB55H6|5.0|I am very impressed with this movie; 5 of 5 stars. Just watched the extended Director's cut making it a very very long movie. The story is very complex with alot of flash-backs and even some flash-forwards. Several stories are intermixed until they finally all come together. Great characters. Unique style of photography and vision. I just added this to my list of favorites. I will have to see this movie a few times to completely digest and understand it; complex.
B000WS4QJG|4.0|Today is Sept. 21, 2009. I would very much like to review this item, but I can't. Because it hes never come. I made my order on August 10th. Made my claim [that I had never received the item] and was told that they would send me another. Well that has never shown up either. Sooo, customer satisfaction?? What's that??!
B000V6BE6M|5.0|id suggest pickign up this along with the other 2 previous audio cd's.  This is the *complete*  musical audio recording of the entire musical score of Return of the King. Its is incredible and awsome and if you have the first 2 - The Fellowship of the Ring- the complete recordings and The Two Towers: the complete recordings..... between the three of these amazing  sets- you have beautiful and incredible music for easily a solid day.  I listen to it when im doing wiring projects on Harleys or rebuilding my neighbor's ipod's.<br /><br />if you're an epic LOTR (Lord of the Rings) fan, as i am..... you're going to *really* want this..... and id suggest getting it.... its the only place you're going to hear the hobbits singing at the Green Dragon in Hobbiton, hear Merry and Pippin singing after the battle of Helms Deep in the hall after hailing the victorious dead of the battle..... and so many other little things that i dont recall-  But this is definately a must have (along with the other 2)
0440180295|4.0|Slaughterhouse-Five is a deep book that can be read on many levels.  On the surface, it's a science fiction tale that deals with a man, Billy Pilgrim, who was purportedly abducted by aliens and can become \\"unstuck\\" in time, and can move back and forth between and re-experience moments of his life at any point between his birth and death.  A signficant part of the book deals with the Billy's experiences in World War II and being present when the German city of Dresden was destroyed by Allied bombing in February 1945.  However, this tale is at least in small part, autobiographical, as the books writer, Kurt Vonnegut, served in World War II and many of the decriptions given in the book are clearly derived from Mr Vonnegut's experiences.  It was largely to read about these experiences that I bought and read Slaughterhouse-Five.<br /><br />Many books have been written about the destruction of Dresden, but Mr Vonnegut's point of view ... that of an American POW being held in Dresden ... is fairly unique.  Even if fiction, at various points in the narrative, Mr Vonnegut apparently speaks directly to the reader, to say that he was the person that such and such event occurred to.  The book is written in a darkly humorous style, and the books shifts from present to past to future quite often, as befitting the experiences of someone who has become unstuck in time.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book as entertainment, and felt that it also added to my understanding of what happened at Dresden in World War II.  My only quibble with the book is that the ending seems a bit flat to me, although given that the book is an anti-war science fiction novel, it may not be entirely out of place.
0800141660|5.0|I wish I could express how much a movie like this one can take you away to a place that you can leave all of your worries behind. I am a true fan of this one and am ordering more today because of it. I haven't seen Pride and Prejudice or Persuasion so I will wait for them to arrive with much anticipation. You will not regret one moment buying this movie.   Needless to say the actors are so talented they make you feel you are there. I don't know how else to describe it, so I will just say BUY IT!!! I am certain you will enjoy.   Also I ordered this using my prime account and received it the day after I ordered it which actually was one day faster than promised.
B000002J27|5.0|It was 1976. Genesis was at a standstill. Peter Gabriel had just left the group, and they had released their critical masterpiece 'The Lamb Dies Down On Broadway' just two years earlier. Gabriel, the group's frontman, left Genesis in 1975 after the 'Lamb' tour to start his own solo career.     The group interviewed many different lead vocalists, and eventually settled on their own: Phil Collins, the group's drummer since 1971 (the year 'Nursery Cryme,' another great record was released), took over the role as the lead vocalist. The result of all of this transitioning was this, 1976's 'A Trick of the Tail.'    At this time, Genesis were at a creative peak. One listen to 'Dance on a Volcano' and you'll understand my reasoning. Great vocals by a young (25 at the time) Phil and a great keyboard riff by Tony. Steve's guitar is great throughout, especially at the jam session near the end of the track. Truly one of the greatest Genesis tracks to appear on one of their records.     'Entangled' is a great, madrigal-like acoustic number. Mike and Steve play mellow acoustic guitar, and Tony's keyboards at the end are just haunting. Truly one of the most bone chilling moments they ever did.     Moving right along, 'Squonk' provided Genesis a great, rhythmic jam session, with some of Phil's best vocals. But, take my word, the song sounds much better on 'Seconds Out,' and I strongly recommend you buy that album along with this one. It's one of the all-time great live albums.    'Mad Man Moon' is perhaps Genesis' most underrated song. A nice, piano-driven ballad featuring mellow vocals by Phil and a driving acoustic piano as only Tony can play. And Tony's solo here is outstanding, proving the point of how great a keyboardist Tony is. Just an outstanding song, probably one of my favorite Genesis songs period.    'Robbery, Assault & Battery' is a nice little mini-rock opera that just sounds great here. Another great keyboard driven song, Tony sounds awesome here and really shines. Ihave often wondered how this song would have sounded with Peter Gabriel at the helm. One has to wonder...    'Ripples' is another great acoustic ballad, and like 'Entangled,' features a madrigal-like sound to it. It starts of with Mike and Steve playing acoustic guitars, and Tony playing a harpsichord, with Phil singing quietly and mellowly. The song kicks into a jam session halfway into the song, with Tony and Steve just dominating. This is a highlight of 'A Trick of the Tail.'    The title track is a nice little ditty, and is the shortest song on the album. It's actually one of my favorites on the album; it's a simple, catchy little song and one of the first where Phil really comes into his own as a vocalist. An excellent song indeed.    And what a better way to close a record than 'Los Endos'? Clocking in at 5:49, 'Los Endos' is instrumental, and Mike, Tony, Phil and Steve just jam here. This has become a concert staple for the group, and one of the few songs from their '70s days that Genesis continued to play live after the 'Abacab' tour. This is one of the best songs they ever did by a long shot, because it's so complex. I recommend listening to the version on 'Seconds Out' as well, which features a great drum duet between Phil and their longtime touring drummer Chester Thompson prior to the start of the song.    Overall, 'A Trick of the Tail' is one of their best albums period and is one of my personal favorite albums. It's such a great album to listen to because there are so many different moods on it. It's a very sophisticated album, and it's hard to believe that this is the same band (sans Steve Hackett) that released 'Invisible Touch' exactly ten years later.     Something else to note is this album was remastered and remixed (by Nick Davis) in 2007. I don't recommend that reissue; notice the word REMIX. I much prefer the original 1994 remaster, because everything just sounds right. Although the 2007 remaster is good (and it's the only one that's readilyavailable nowadays), if you plan on buying the remastered 2007 version of this, hang on to your 1994 copy and compare the two. That way you can make your own decision about which mix is better. But I prefer the '94 version personally.    I can't recommend this album enough. It's one of the greatest albums they ever did and is to this day a personal favorite of mine; it's something everybody should listen to at least once. It's just that great of an album.     Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended.    ENJOY!!!
B000001FDK|5.0|This is a soundtrack from Grease, and it has all the great music.  I really enjoy this CD.
0743289692|5.0|Just the fact that the author has to go into hiding over telling her story, and the movie and the interviews she made stirred such a commotion to warrant death threats, and an actual murder, that alone gives her the ultimate credibility. It would 've been better for the Muslim population, had she just been ignored for her views. But its like the author was goading the Muslim community, in order to illustrate, through their own actions, how primitive their responses are to someone who opposes them. She really accomplished her goal of letting people know the atrocities and inhumane conditions that her culture as she grew up did to people. And for her words to be responded to in such a violent manner, that does not make the accused look good, does it? People do not get angry over things that are silly, and untrue. They get angry when the truth is spoken. Like I said, the reaction to this book alone, is the ultimate credibility.
0385504225|3.0|The Lost Symbol is like a summer blockbuster movie...don't take it too seriously, and you'll have a good time reading it.   Yes, the writing is poor at times, and the main character Langdon goes from being the smartest guy in the room to completely clueless too many times to count.  I found the \\"national security crisis\\" that required the involvement of the CIA to be laughable...and unnecessary.   I can tell that Brown is trying very hard to be a serious writer, but his tendency to lecture to his audience is one of his great weaknesses.   Read this for fun, read this for pleasure, but don't expect much more than cheap entertainment.
0486409511|5.0|I used to do Italic Calligraphy but I haven't done anything for 10 years.  My son is getting married and asked me to address his wedding invitations.  I thought this was a good time to learn Copperplate.  This book was great.  It tells you everything from what kind of nibs to use (I liked Gillott 303), which type of oblique nib holder to use, ink, holding the pen, posture, what paper to use for practicing (you do need special paper), and letter formation.  I followed everything she said and practiced for two weeks to make sure I was comfortable with the letters and the letter connections.  The invitations are now addressed and look very professional if I do say so myself.  My daughter said it looked like I had been doing Copperplate for years, not weeks.  Thanks Eleanor for such a thorough book
0743497465|4.0|This book is a barn burner. Try not to take it too seriously. Supposedly a politician's election campaign for president hinges on NASA, of all things, and supposedly the fraud of the millenium is perpetrated just to elect this guy into office.<br /><br />The characters are predictably shallow and the plot is outlandish, but the way Brown writes the action scenes is downright cinematic. The climactic set piece is a duel with a helicopter on a ship floating above an underwater volcano off the New Jersey coast. Unbelievable, I know, but the orchestration of all these elements is incredible. Bravo, Brown!<br /><br />This is a much better book than Angels & Demons, which was insulting to the reader because of the false dichotomy of faith and science, and the evil perpetrated by the \\"Camerlengo.\\" The suspense of Deception Point, though, is not as intense as The Da Vinci Code. Read this for the thrills.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|horrible waste of time  and money  I cannot believe after six years THIS is what Dan Brown gives to his loyal followers.  Very diappointing Dan.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I had a difficult time putting this book down.  The theories the author presents in the story challenged me to think about my own beliefs.  The story was full of excitement and twists.  I was able to guess some of the twists before they happened, but not too early on in the story.  It was fast paced and was one of my favorite books now.
0786838655|5.0|This Is a very interesting book. It is filled with action, non-stop. When Percy Jackson (half-human,half-god) gets mad nothing will stand in his way from what he is trying or going to do. Percy is a strong but has dyslexia,he can also fight very well.He took the news about Gods and Demi- Gods very well too.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Remember your college Professor who loved to hear himself talk? And kept forgetting he already told the class that REALLY interesting story? That is Dan Brown and \\"The Lost Symbol.\\"  I read the enitre Kindle version, just so I could say I read the whole damn boring book. I guess he will make a fortune, and the joke is on us. Don't bother with this gibberish slab of Masonic propaganda. If Tom Hanks agrees to star in the movie version of this book, he has certainly sold his soul to the devil.
B000EGCITG|3.0|There are not many good songs on this cd. There are a couple though. I luv pink but she is kinda vulgar in some songs and I don't like it when she says g..d.... But it is what I ordered. It is in good conition. I would buy from this seller again
B00074C6DS|5.0|I don't get what the other reviewer was so angry about. This CD sounds fine to my ears. It's the same master as the jewel-boxed American or British Apple CD, so if you were looking for it to sound different, you're out of luck. But it really isn't a poorly mastered title, so I don't know why the other guy thought it was so bad.    If you need a different master of it, try finding the DCC gold CD mastered by Steve Hoffman. It's a bit smoother.

B001TOD92C|5.0|Mickey Rourke puts in an award-winning performance as Randy \\"the Ram\\" Robinson, a pro wrestler well past his prime who cannot give up doing what he loves best. Randy lives in a rundown trailer (which the landlord locks him out of when he can't pay the rent), drives an ancient van, works part-time for a grocery store, and spends his free time at a strip club, where he flirts with a stripper whose real name is Pam, played by Marisa Tomei. After he has a heart attack and the doctor tells him to fight again will probaly kill him, Randy reaches out to his daughter, a young woman who harbors strong resentment against him because he was never available to her as a child. Their relationship is fragile and brief, and when he forgets to meet her for a dinner engagement, she tells him she doesn't want to see him again, which sends Randy spiraling out of control toward the one true thing he can count on: his fans and the ring.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei and Mickey Rourke excel in this movie. Although it seemed to plod along at times, the story is intriguing and well worth watching.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|I just bought this CD and it reminded me why I really liked George Harrison. \\"My Sweet Lord', and 'All Things Must Pass', are two of my favorites. \\"Give Me Love\\" was so unlike the Beatles material. But I think his work with them \\"Something\\" \\"My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" are so powerful. You could tell he was being frustrated by John and Paul, his solo works demonstrate how really good a song writer he was.
0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown's books are formulaic enough that others anticipated this new book that uses Freemasonry as a link to the past -- that past mangled and muddled by works like The Lost Symbol. I can sympathize with Brown having to rework his formula so that the cottage industry that is parasitic on his work didn't abscond with it completely. But time would have been better spent learning the Eurasian Culture more fully. Not doing that results in Brown's books reinforcing the suppression of that Culture by the monotheisms of the Near East and the Medieval apparatus of Christianity in the West. As a result, Brown's work is more damaging to a Eurasian Renaissance than helpful -- even when he supposedly supports such a rise of that Culture. My own research and books (The Order of the Dragon, The White Island and the Black Book, the biography of Lucifer series) calls for such a renaissance, but with scientific, metaphysical and philosophic foundations from the far north traditions. The old texts are there, waiting to be used, but Brown hasn't done that. He should study Shiva more carefully, and he should read Yuri Stoyanov on the Diver tradition, before ending his book with pontification about \\"Praise God.\\" The chillest message of his book is that one of the heroes, Peter, is indistinguishable from the arch villain Malakh (word play on the Hebrew title for Satan, the \\"malak\\" of God; and failure to understand Melak Taus, the Yezidi equivalent of the rebel angel of free thought). While Malakh had a sense of ethics that finally drove him mad, Peter has empty anguish that vaporizes quickly. That Brown sends one to the Christian Hell is not a point in his favor, or the favor of the depths of this book. My only reluctant conclusion can be that this book, while raising important issues, confuses and damages the discussion -- becoming an indirect suppression in its own right.    Dr. Colleen D. Clements
B00004VVND|4.0|I've seen \\"Westworld\\" probably 3 or 4 times since the first time I saw it on TV in the late 70s and it never fails to entertain. The plot ought to be known to just about everybody by now, it's been parodied and recycled so many times: a couple of vacationers (James Brolin and Richard Benjamin) take a trip to Delos, the resort of the future, where one can immerse oneself fully in the experience of another time and place: WesternWorld for the American old west of 1880, MedievalWorld gives you a European castle circa 1300, and RomanWorld the villas of the Caesars. Each world is populated by amazingly life-like robots and one can do just about anything with them that one can do with real-life humans, including get into gunfights as Peter (Benjamin) finds out very early on when challenged to draw at a bar by a mysterious Gunslinger (Yul Brynner). After winning the showdown by plugging the Gunslinger three times, John (Brolin) explains to Peter that the guns they carry have sensors that don't allow them to shoot real people, so everything is perfectly safe. Until, of course, the robots go haywire...<br /><br />This tense, economical thriller might be my favorite Michael Crichton work. Though he's nothing special as a director, using Cinemascope with few nods to its visual possibilities (this is his 2nd film), his screenplay cuts out all the fat in favor of building suspense and paranoia. The film alternates in its first hour or so between scenes of Peter and John and their western adventures (barfights, shootouts, hookers), the scientists in their hidden control rooms gradually becoming aware of more and more malfunctions, and occasional shots of MedievalWorld and a bumbling guest there who has been challenged to fight the Black Knight. When that swordfight goes terribly wrong, the scientists know they are too late, and as Peter finds his options rapidly dwindling, he is followed through the last third of movie by the implacable black-garbed Gunslinger who won't quit, won't give up, can't be killed.<br /><br />Somewhat famous now for the first-ever use of CGI in film (Brynner's robot vision) this is really more significant for its paranoia about scientists and technology, a constant theme in Crichton's work from near the beginning of his career. In \\"Westworld\\" the cynicism about corporate greed is there as well - interesting because Crichton would later side with business in his protestations against what he saw as the global warming \\"scare\\" - and the combination of the scientist's arrogance and the Delos owners' desires to keep off bad publicity while trying to solve the problems without telling anyone is what ultimately leads to disaster. Even though at the end, Peter manages to stop the Gunslinger with a combination of acid and fire, he is left alone in an apparently dead park, and the close-up on his face at the end doesn't register relief but rather despair.<br /><br />I can say I've ever been exactly a fan of 70s geeky icon Richard Benjamin, and he's rather annoying at the beginning here, constantly acting nervous and unable to enjoy himself, but he does develop into a fairly effective hero. The scientists are poorly developed and the whole behind-the-scenes section seems there mostly just to give us enough information so that we can play along....but Brynner's dead-eyed Gunslinger is unforgettable, and his remorseless hunt at the finish through western streets, Roman gardens, underground corridors and medieval castle is the main reason this film has a deserved reputation as one of the better SF films of its day. And there's no question that Arnold Schwarzenegger's \\"Terminator\\" character a decade later owes Brynner's killing machine a conceptual debt. Flawed and silly at times, and maybe a little too short and neat ultimately, this is nevertheless lots of fun and an interesting early example of its writer/director's career-long preoccupationsup, can't be killed.

630469797X|1.0|Judging from the huge pileup of 5-star reviews, I must not have what it takes to appreciate this film.    I have no problem whatsoever with zombie movies. I've watched and enjoyed many of them. Dawn of the Dead is a horrible movie. One of the worst I have ever seen.    The dialog is ludicrous. The actors are utterly unconvincing. The plot is absurd. The special effects are laughable (even for its time).    The makeup was the high spot and it wasn't all that great.    There were way too many shots of the dead wandering around. Cut them out, and this movie would be better (and 30 merciful minutes shorter).    I am an extraordinarily patient movie consumer, but sitting through this was excruciating. There isn't a friend, enemy, or total stranger to whom I would recommend this film.
B001FB55MG|5.0|This was not my first choice, but I was very pleasently surprised by the story.  I will recommend it.
B002BSHWUU|1.0|I love the Beatles and have been anxiously awaiting the release of this comprehensive box set- LOOK OUT!!!   The remastering of the monos are, well, O.K. BUT, all of the recordings originally done in Dynamic Stereophonic Sound are TOTALLY RUINED! The old process of the Dynamic Stereo Sound recording nearly completely seperated the left from the right channel,(a process that Pink Floyd and Rick Wakeman among others used to psychedelic advantage in the 70's on Dark Side of the Moon and Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, respectively), however, the remastering people completely threw out one side of the track in favor of another so that in ALL of these recordings you only get one channel plus the minimal bleed through that occured in the original recordings and IT SUCKS!!! Whole sections are missing in a lot of George's guitar work on Sgt. Peppers-Magical Mystery Tour-and Hey Jude that I have already heard for myself. Back up vocals and many co-lead vocals,(usually John's), are missing altogether! (Did Paul help produce this collection)? If you want to hear the Beatles the way you remember them, get nonremastered C.D.s.  I'll take the tape hiss over missing music and vocals any day!   P.S. I am adding a line after seeing the comments to my review- No, I'm not confusing the Mono with the Stereo box, and no, my $2000 set of Klipsch Studio Monitor speakers are working just fine, thank you. However, I grew up on the original recordings and am an accomplished piano and guitar player. I know what I'm talking about, the loudness isn't the problem, The bass line,(Paul's instrument),and his vocals are enhanced and many of George's guitar riffs,(Paperback Writer, Rain, and others), as well as John's vocals are JUST MISSING!!!! What's there is much cleaner, I agree, but what's missing is simply missing. So don't get mad at me for catching it and pointing it out; it won't make it be there. (Also, when I play my DirectTV 60's/70's Classic Rock channel, the same parts are missing there as well). Still if this new generation insists that the Emperor IS wearing clothes, what can I say?
0385504225|2.0|When I started this book, I wasn't expecting quality like Michael Connelly or Dennis Lehane provide, but I was hoping for more than Brown gave us with this novel.  The twist was unbelievably transparent, and really should be picked up by anyone who read the book that was paying any type of attention.  The plot is a carbon copy of the previous Brown books (both Langdon and non-Langdon related), where a supporting character is brought in to a dire situation in order to have the main character (Langdon for this book) explain every detail that is happening in order to be able to communicate it to the readers, instead of writing it in such a way that the readers can figure it out themselves (or trusting that the readers are smart enough to do so).  Even if you can see beyond those issues, the plot is convoluted and the last act reminds me of \\"The Shack\\" by William Young, not something you want from a supposed action-oriented novel.    Overall, it was a huge disappointment.
0143034901|3.0|This book is well written, and it has a very good plot. I normally don't read these types of books, but overall it is a good book for a book of this genere. I only gave it three stars because I thought it was a bit long, and a tad bit slow at times.
B002K0WBY6|5.0|This movie was fantastic!! And you couldn't have asked for two better stars to play the leading roles!! The storyline/plot is funny and original. The characters are well-rounded, although not deep. But for a comedy, very impressive.<br /><br />There are scenes in the movie that will leave you in stitches!! There are also parts that will make you wish you lived in Alaska because the scenery is so beautiful.<br /><br />I think this Sandy's funniest movie to date and as well for Ryan Reynolds. Applause!!<br /><br />If you're looking for a happily ever-after, hilarious movie, The Proposal should definitely be on your list. A++++!!
B001FOPODS|5.0|This film is so very worthy of the Oscar it won for \\"Best Animated Short\\" in 2008.  The stop animation process has been perfected in this movie.  The scenery and characters are simply breathtaking.  The story is a wonderfully dark tale, told with no dialogue.  All feelings, words, and thoughts are expressed through the music and the intense look in Peter's eyes.  I have three children who love this movie, so it isn't too dark for young kids.  The duck, unfortunately, gets dispatched by the wolf.  I used this as a great opportunity to teach my kids that unfortunately, sometimes even the cute and cuddly animals don't make it.  Excellent storytelling and a beautifully animated film await.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is without a doubt the best I've ever heard the Fab 4 sound.  It's like listening to a pristine vinyl recording.  The sound level is not loud as most of today's cd's are with an overbearing mid-range.  There is plenty of room to breath as you raise the volume.  You will also notice things you never noticed before.  One such example is the piano in \\"The Ballad Of John & Yoko\\".  Just listen and you'll pull out many such instances of your own. Finally a job well done!
0385504225|2.0|It was annoying that about half of the writing he devoted to free masons he spent defending them.  I didn't want to hear how great free masons were I just wanted deeper information about them.  I didn't like that he left the reader hanging at the end of almost every chapter.  It is a trick Michael Crichton used at the end of each of his chapters and it is pretty annoying when it was overused.
B00204AA0O|5.0|Fun.  Magical.  At times dark.  This album makes me feel like I'm under a blanket fort with my best girlfriend while she tells me secrets and stories by flashlight.  Regina Spektor's voice is warm and comforting, and when she soars, heartbreaking.  My favorite album so far this year.
0385504225|4.0|No it's not a work of art or the best book I've ever read, but I really enjoyed it. I have read all of Dan Brown's books and will most likely read any new books he puts out. If they make a movie, I'll go see it.
1439102813|5.0|What's so fascinating is that the author pulls the reader into the protagonist's journey, conveying her confusion as her condition worsens.  At times, I am not sure what is real, or not, as I imagine an Alzheimer's patient might be.  With the author's background in neuroscience and Alzheimer's, this is no surprise, but she also has developed realistic, fully-rounded characters.  Because of the subject matter, I was hesitant to read this book but found I couldn't put it down.
1400032717|5.0|Christopher Boone would not be an easy person to know except through Haddon's book. Scared of hugs and people asking questions, Christopher braves the unknown world of across the street, the train station waiting room, and the open streets of London at night in pursuit of the truth of who murdered his neighbor's dog, and coping with the consequences of finding out.     This is the kind of book that gets passed hand to hand and enjoyed by all. Clever, surprising, remarkable, insightful, and probably best for middle school and above, it's both meaningful and enjoyable on every page.
0385504225|4.0|What consists of about 500+pages of puzzles, conspiracy theories, secret society initiations, hidden Freemason knowledge and the pairing of quantum physics with the New Age (or Old Age) theory of a universal consciousness?  The new Dan Brown blockbuster, of course.<br /><br />After a successful run, or should I say chase, down the streets of Rome in [[ASIN:1416580824 Angels & Demons - Movie Tie-In: A Novel]] and Paris in \\"[[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]],\\" Brown brings the action across the pond to the new world--the shining citadel that Deists around the globe proudly recognize as a onetime symbol of humanity's hope for a future illuminated with the fruition of everything man could create and imagine--Washington D. C.--the Lost Symbol.<br /><br />In our bipartisan political framework where the media rules and dictates what the common man desires--fame, celebrity, wealth, power, plasma TV, brand new billion dollar stadiums to celebrate the idea of a bread and circus for the 21st century--Brown stands at his pulpit of mainstream popularity and delivers a bit of a profound message for the masses.  Pointing to the Capital building and the wondrous symbology of the American capital and its environs, he chastises the last---oops! --two hundred and thirty-three years, exclaiming that the very infighting that separated mankind from its own development and caused the founding of a nation that pushed aside religious and all other differences had crept into man's thinking yet again--and a veritable stirring of the ant pile that suggests a natural formation of hierarchical beings was in desperate need to return us to our original founding principles.<br /><br />Cleverly, as media evangelist, Brown hides his own message in a carefully honed vehicle--the popular suspense novel where he lays the cornerstone of his own genre founded and perfected by him, despite the numerous unsuccessful attempts at cloning its success.  The reading public reaches for and grabs this, the Da Vinci Code School of Literature like infants seeking sugar-infused formula filled with vitamins and minerals necessary for standardized growth.<br /><br />And grow we do, when we read Brown's interesting philosophy cloaked within the conundrum of the bestselling thriller.  Freely, for the price of $30 USD, we follow him into the bowels beneath the Rotunda and onto a magical mystery tour of arcane Americana that leads to the mythical pyramid of the Freemasons and perhaps to the rediscovery of ancient knowledge that will help us approximate the divinity of God.<br /><br />Using the science of Noetics as a springboard, Brown discusses the connection to the universe that we, Age of Aquarians, have been pondering since we knew how to ponder.  Wonder of wonders, he deftly demonstrates the exponential power of group intention--where many minds are focused on a particular outcome, creating a phenomenal success for himself--many readers concentrated on Brown's next book--and lo and behold, it was a runaway success, commanding much discussion and speculation even before it was in print.  How's that for a universal consciousness changing and redefining Brown's world as orchestrated by Brown?  Brown will do for the theories purported by the Institute of Noetic Science what he did for all those egalitarians who loved the fact that Mary Magdeline was the first and foremost disciple of the Christ.<br /><br />Honestly, the intense interest that Brown generates in terms of his message for the masses in the language of the mainstream is close to phenomenal.  He teaches.  He instructs.  And he gains disciples of his own that hang on his every word without the necessity of highbrow esoteric nonsense or the trill of a fancy phrase.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This isn't great literature, but Dan Brown achieves the near impossible.  After all the numerous imitations to the formula started in \\"Angels and Demons\\" and perfected in \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" in `The Lost Symbol,' he writes another spectacular whirlwind novel, replete with a crazed villain intent on destruction, a brilliant woman scientist that acts as sacred feminine to the protagonist Professor Langdon's yang, a time-sensitive drive to solve an ancient puzzle both word and numeric, the failure of which means death to an unsuspecting innocent and rings within rings of conspirators who are not quite sure which side they are on until the very last page.  Like the conundrums of which he writes, Brown packages a message within a message that in the case of The Lost Symbol subtly urges America back to its roots, rising above the labyrinth of religious differences and bipartisan politics to soar above on the level of the Capital Dome to glimpse at its true destiny.  Formulaic at times predictable, with characters speaking as if they just emerged from a cave to see a light that for seconds blinds them, The Lost Symbol entertains and works with no need for either six nor the Masonic 33 degrees of separation.  Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"illain intent on destruction, a brilliant woman scientist that acts as sacred feminine to the protagonist Professor Langdon's yang, a time-sensitive drive to solve an ancient puzzle both word and numeric, the failure of which means death to an unsuspecting innocent and rings within rings of conspirators who are not quite sure which side they are on until the very last page.

B000KX0IOA|4.0|This movie was about a common man that became the influential person in India.  In the beginning he started out as a mere lawyer that turned extreme activist. His influence over people was amazing.  From the beginning he started off just trying to get equality for Hindu people in South Africa, after being thrown off of a train because he would not sit in third class because he was what they called \\"colored\\".  After achieving his goal he went to India and acomplished the most amazing things.  He took beatings from the police, jail time, and ridicule with stride.  His method of fighting was not violence but disobedience.  This worked to a point but he was trying to get his followers to understand that it only works if you do not sink to the other persons level and stand strong because the other person will see the wrong in what they have done eventually.  He acieved his goal of helping India gain its independence but that just turned into a religionous war.  Hindus verses Muslims.  To Gandhi this was unexceptable.  He went on a hunger strike until the fighting stopped this almost killed him.  Eventually people took a step back though and the fighting did end.  This related to my world religions class because I think Ghandi had a very hinduism view of things.  He believed that everyone was equal, and the they may all believe in different faiths but it all came down to the same supreme god.  This reminded me of the main message of the  Upanishads, that Brahman is Atman so everyone is equal.  Gandhi treated treated everyone like they were part of his family.  Everyone in his eyes was quual.  He walked in the shoes of the rich, and also lived in the clothes of the poor.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|When this album,cassette, or compact disc first came out, Madonna introduced a dark side of sexuality--the sado-masochism where dominatrixes would dominate over mostly men in the dark out of side. They would pay to be humiliated, punished, slapped, and mistreated on purpose. Erotica is surely an erotic song, very sensual and romanticizes the sado-masochistic world as something both dark and exciting and secretive. It's a hidden side of sexuality even in today's world. Madonna unveiled the darkness with this song. Yes, it's both sensual and erotic. With sexuality, Madonna has shown to be no prude and unveils all for her audience. There are some other songs on this compact disc but it starts off with Erotica and followed by Fever as a cool down song. Her version is a nice tribute to Peggy Lee's song. There are some other songs on there. I believe this was her Truth or Dare tour. Now, Madonna has pretty much unveiled everything sexually speaking. She allows sexuality to be both sensual and daring and a free-ing experience rather than the shameful, vulgar, and embarrassing part of human nature. I give Madonna credit for changing her styles in music and fashion over the years. She reinvents herself so much that we don't get bored with her but who can get bored with Madonna? She's the naughty Italian Catholic girl from Detroit.
0385504225|4.0|Judging by other reviews, this book seems to average 2 or 3 stars. I'm giving it four, but based solely on this: the book is exactly what it's expected to be. It's not a great work of literature; it's not this elegantly crafted work of fiction which enlightens the soul and makes grown men cry. No, the book is exactly what I expected when I first heard about it: a fun, entertaining read filled with wild conspiracies and jumping plots and action and symbols and twisting, elaborate sub-plots that all culminate in a mostly-predictable yet still-thrilling tale of Robert Langdon.     In a nutshell, it was FUN!    If we're judging this book on quality, then yeah, I'd give it two stars. Maybe. If I was being generous. Because it's not well written. The plot jumps too much, the characters are predictable and, at times, flat, and the book is so over-loaded with religious and government conspiracy that it makes you want to gag to think about.     But this is exactly what anyone who's read Brown before would expect going in. Instead, I choose to focus on the fact that I started this book four hours ago, and stopped only briefly to eat (and watch some Sunday Night Football!) before diving right back in. Robert is in Washington DC this time, after being tricked into the city by a madman who is seeking the key to knowledge and power, a secret that the Freemasons are protecting at all costs.     The plot takes place in just one night, and Langdon jumps around DC as he races against the clock to save his mentor, who is being held hostage, and to unravel clue upon clue buried beneath the idea of the Mason's Pyramid, said to be a map to the greatest treasure in the country, all while dodging government agents out to stop him.    Brown definitely has a way with plot. While the plot was mostly predictable (this is no surprise, and in fact quite welcome... Brown doesn't try to play games), there were a few places that had me surprised, and the symbology layered throughout the book was brilliantly done.      The final word: If you go into this book expecting a \\"great read\\", then you'll be disappointed. But if you go in expecting something to entertain you, something that is fun, a bit of mental candy, then you'll come out satisfied!
B001AQTWF2|4.0|Like a lot of people, I grew up with Whitney's music, and several of her songs evoke important memories. She's one of those artists privileged to have their music become a part of people's lives in a lasting way. That blessing is also one of the biggest hurdles Houston faces in her comeback. The \\"old Whitney,\\" or at least her music, was so much a part of so many people's lives that it's that Whitney they want back -- the Whitney of \\"The Bodyguard,\\" some seventeen years ago.<br /><br />But few people who are exactly what they were or can do exactly what they did over twenty years ago, exactly the way they did it then -- even people who haven't been down the destructive path that even Houston acknowledges she traveled for too many years. It took her far away from music, and perhaps far away from the hearts of some fans.<br /><br />\\"I Look To You\\" is Houston's attempt to find her way back. And it's a pretty solid sign that she'll find her way back, though she may run into a few roadblocks along the way.<br /><br />Coming from any other artist, perhaps, \\"I Look To You\\" would be recognized for the solid set of mid-tempo pop/R&B that it is, with enough variety -- ranging from straight forward pop, to soulful R&B, to the standard ballads and dancefloor anthems people have come to expect of Houston. A few of them -- \\"Million Dollar Bill,\\" \\"Nothin' But Love,\\" \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength,\\" and the title track -- linger, and you may find yourself humming them unexpectedly.<br /><br />No, \\"The Voice\\" isn't what it used to be. Nothing is after 20 years of use, let alone abuse. Time and technique will do a number even if there's no other trouble to contend with. Artists age, just like actors and athletes, etc., and the voice is the product of a physical instrument that over time will no longer do what it used to. Opera singers often retire at some point when it becomes clear that the body can no longer deliver the voice as it used to. Pop singers, if they're lucky, adapt to their new voices and find material that serve them well.<br /><br />Some of the songs on \\"I Look To You,\\" indeed serve Houston well, as she proves she can still sell a song and embrace a lyric believably. At the same time, Houston is clearly operating within the bounds of her new voice. Pushing it a bit here and there, but mostly staying closer to the ground than she used to. The effect is that listeners at once hear in their mind where the \\"old Whitney\\" would have taken a note or a phrase. But those who listen closely will hear a more grounded singer -- who sounds more like a woman than she does girlish -- whose not only \\"lived in\\" her voice, but has lived things that she only sung about before.<br /><br />And she still comes up singing. That she has a voice left, and doesn't sound like Marianne Faithful, is a minor miracle in and of itself. But what Houston's new voice lacks in range is still has in power, and makes up for in color and depth that it didn't have before. It's no longer \\"perfect,\\" as it was described, but it's no less powerful or listenable. In fact, if anything, it's more interesting.<br /><br />There may be people who will only accept the \\"old Whitney\\" or some approximation thereof. They will probably come away disappointed. There may be people who aren't willing or able to forgive Houston for no longer having that \\"perfect\\" voice or not being perfect herself. They will come away disappointed, too.<br /><br />As Houston herself knows, what's done can't be undone. \\"I Turn To You,\\" is a promising sign that there is still much Houston can do musically, and that she's moving on in that direction. I only hope that, when she returns to the studio, more effort is made to find material both musically suited to Houston's new voice, and lyrically suited to her experience.<br /><br />I'd suggest at least one cover song for the next CD: \\"Everything Must Change.\\"l that serve them well.

B001P3SA8U|4.0|I feel it's becoming all too obvious that I enjoy films with great music. Add a historical bent to it and you've REALLY got me hooked. So, no surprise, CADILLAC RECORDS really captivated me.<br /><br />As the older musical population dies out, most of our youth have no idea where the origins of their music revolution started. A sad but true statement that can be tested by asking any person under 30 who Muddy Waters was. Or Little Walter. Or Etta James. They may not even know the name Chuck Berry! Gasp!<br /><br />Cadillac Records helps set the historical record straight. A (semi-) true story surrounding a white man named Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody, HOLLYWOODLAND) who signs some of the most noted (and destructive) musical talent of the 40s, 50s, and 60s, he set up a studio and was the first white man to pull in men (and women) of color. Most notable among them was the amazing Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright, LADY IN THE WATER), a blues plucking sharecropper barely out of slavery who's voice and guitar sounds struck a chord with the public. Along with him came Little Walter (Columbus Short, WAR OF THE WORLDS) who's harmonica playing startled all who heard it. And later came Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and the incredible Etta James (Beyonce Knowles, DREAMGIRLS). And who could EVER forget the incomparable Chuck Berry (Mos Def, 16 BLOCKS). All of these men and women signed on with Cadillac Records and became smash hits overnight. But with success came tumult. Drugs, racism, womanizing, money, and personal conflict all took tolls on these amazing players.<br /><br />For me, the best parts of this flick were watching Jeffrey Wright LIVE the life of Muddy. His voice and mannerisms made me feel like I was watching a reincarnation of the man and not simply a characterization (which is why I feel Wright should've gotten top billing for the film and not Adrien Brody). There were two large acting surprises for me, too: Beyonce and Mos Def. Both aren't known for their acting abilities, particularly Mos Def since his annoying performance in 16 Blocks. Beyonce did okay in Dreamgirls, but here she shines with a new light as Etta James. Watching her sing \\"At Last\\" sent chills up my spine. She grasped the significance of that song and pulled down a truly inspired role. And Mos Def as Chuck Berry really surprised me. He leapt around and swooned just like the stock footage I'd seen of Berry. Great job.<br /><br />The sets, costumes, and filming were simply exemplary, too. I really felt like I was in the 40s thru 60s.<br /><br />The only flaw in the film was that it really had no plot. There wasn't a goal ...other than to show you the lives of these wonderful and tormented men and women. But that didn't bother me overly much. Still, it's something to consider when watching it.<br /><br />No review would be complete without mentioning the soundtrack. Astounding! The tunes are a walk down memory lane and recount the history of who started the new music revolution. Beach Boy fans and Led heads (Led Zeppelin fans) beware!<br /><br />Yo kids! Wanna know where rap came from?<br /><br />(NOTE: Some have complained about the historical inaccuracies and deletions. I understand them, but that doesn't make this film a bad flick.)s Def since his annoying performance in 16 Blocks. Beyonce did okay in Dreamgirls, but here she shines with a new light as Etta James.

B001PPLJJ0|3.0|***CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I'm sort of surprised that the Jewish community hasn't gotten a tad up-in-arms over this film. I mean, it really sets a seriously sympathetic tone for a death-camp guard with unfortunate circumstances. I realize she wasn't well educated and had to make tough decisions in order to survive, but so did many people who came out of the holocaust ...Germans among them. But usually NOT death-camp personnel who were the overseers of those who went into gas chambers.<br /><br />Still, this film is well-acted thanks to the amazing performance of Kate Winslet ([[ASIN:B000N0W9WO The Holiday]]) as Hannah Schmitz, the guard in question. Although I won't take anything away from the other actors in this film, particularly young David Kross as Michael Berg, the boy turning into a man with the help of Hannah's sexual appeal, I will say that, without Winslet, this film likely would've fallen flat, theatrically.<br /><br />Set across generations of Germans and Germany, the story is loaded with historical interest surrounding the holocaust courts that were set up after WWII. Hannah, not surprisingly, is a keystone for the courts as they uncover what they think is her sole involvement in the ordering of the deaths of Jewish women in one of the camps. Circling back to her time at the camps as a guard, it is quickly surmised (by the movie watcher and Michael, but not the courts) that Hannah has never learned to read, so has those she's about to condemn read to her.<br /><br />The condemnation is set up in a way that allows Hannah to remember those she's let loose into the gas chambers; a sort of penance for what she is \\"forced\\" to do. In a similar manner, she condemns young Michael to a life of lovelessness in that he can never forget her, his first true love. And when Michael goes to school to become a lawyer, he and his classmates are soon brought into the case involving Hannah, but only as spectators. But for Michael, much more is apparent. He has the chance to save Hannah from the courts but is forced into a moral conundrum: Is she worth saving? Is she deserving?<br /><br />The story continues as we watch Hannah's prison years pass by. With her age comes knowledge and words. Michael sends her packages containing books on tape that he recorded for her, emboldening Hannah to learn to read on her own. Which she does. But is it too late for personal forgiveness and redemption?<br /><br />The ending hits pretty hard at these core issues. Personal responsibility. Moral condemnation. Rule of law. Historical atrocity. All of these are intertwined to form a patina of the past that blurs the future.<br /><br />The film is watchable mainly for the purposes of Kate Winslet. Her performance is absolutely stellar. But the pacing and mixed moral message were tough to swallow for me. I'm not Jewish, but I believe that the holocaust happened. And I believe those associated with it, in any way, do not deserve our sympathies. Even those supposedly \\"forced\\" into these kinds of situations.

0385504225|2.0|Maybe I'm jaded, but if I'm going to have a plot driven by mysterious symbols I surely would not let it all hinge on a sudoku puzzle.   Please. I thought his last book was a bit much with the opening scene in the Louvre lasting way too long. In this one the U. S. Capitol is the setting for just about half the book.   Suspense usually is driven by some dire consequence. In Brown's book it is driven by the fact that some of today's leaders are Masons! Oh my god, Masons like George Washington and Ben Franklin?  If anyone finds this out our country will be ripped apart. No our country will be ripped apart when the CIA can run covert ops in the US as Dan Brown believes. The last time I checked it was the responsibility if the FBI. Ah' who cares, it'll be # 1 for a while, then it will die unlike .... leave it at that. I won't even ruin the end because it's way too silly and obvious for anyone to think about for more than a moment.
0385504225|5.0|This book is a great Dan Brown book.  No you are not going to get dynamic characters.  But you be exposed to very interesting trivia that will make you write down stuff to google later on as well as the need to read just one more chapter.      It is written in the same style and voice as the Da Vinci code.  It is more sinister and it may be a little more interesting too.  It has a good message and it makes you think.      If you are a literary snob, I would advise that you go reread some shakespeare.  This is Dan Brown, contemporary writer of imaginative thrillers, and for what he does, he is very good at it and this book is a good example of that.

That being said, I have to agree to what many reviews have stated - it's great she has a cd out but it's a bit lackluster.

Most of the background music sounds more like it belongs on a Britney cd than a Whitney.

In the Introduction, Gladwell explains how various experts turned out to be wrong after spending months of research attempting to verify the authenticity of a marble statue, whereas several other experts called out the statue as fake after a mere cursory glance.  Therefore, in Blink, Gladwell focuses on the many rapid, often unconscious--but usually correct--decisions, that we make, almost always without knowing exactly why we are doing so.<br /><br />Thus, this book seemed like a perfect fit for me.  As a psychologist, I've always called my own use of rapid cognition \\"intuition,\\" but the term Gladwell uses is \\"thin-slicing,\\" referring to the way in which we utilize just a small piece of the available information.  To make his points, Gladwell presents many different fascinating examples and anecdotes, from psychologist John Gottman's studies of marital relationships to our inherent appearance/racial biases to the tragic police shooting of Amadou Diallo in 1999.  Although I enjoyed reading all of these illustrations, I generally felt that Gladwell drew them out too long--i.e., he seemed to overplay his hand, to the extent that I often wanted to say \\"enough already; get to the point!\\"<br /><br />Overall, however, I found Blink to be a worthwhile read.  I particularly liked the Afterward, where Gladwell suggested some ideas for determining when we should rely on our instincts and when we should take time for more substantial analysis; I actually wished this section had been lengthier.  I would not hesitate to recommend this book, and I certainly may go on to read more of Gladwell's work.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|This is a story about Harold (Will Ferrell), an IRS agent that is obsessive compulsive in every aspect of his life.<br /><br />Harold has a watch that he depends on to control every waking minute of his life.  Everything about Harold is predictable.  One morning he wakes up to his watch and brushes his teeth the usual 38 strokes up and 38 strokes sideways.  He suddenly hears a woman's voice narrating what he is doing.  This is very disconcerting to someone like Harold, or anyone for that matter.  Everything he does is narrated by a voice only he can hear.  The voice states that he is facing imminent death so he goes to a psychiatrist who recommends a literary writer Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) on what to do.  Jules suggests to do something unexpected - like tell a baker he is auditing that he would like to start dating her.  The baker Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is cute, bubbly and strong-willed, but falls for Harold.  This is to be a surprise to the \\"voice\\" narrating his life - and cause a different ending.  Harold begins to have fun and enjoy life and feels he cannot die young.  But then he finds the author, Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson). He learns her books always have an ending where the central character dies at the happiest moment of his life.<br /><br />The movie is entertaining and funny - a good story about life, death and the tax man.
159562015X|4.0|After lead researcher Donald Clifton left this world and Marcus Buckingham left to found his own firm, Gallup leadership must have wondered how they could milk the Now, Discover Your Strengths cash cow. It seems Strengths Finder 2.0 a \\"NEW & UPGRADED Edition of the Online Test from Gallup's\\" was their answer: a beautiful little book in a shiny white cover, with a powerful red font and the \\"2.0' that was all the rage in `07-'08.<br /><br />Since \\"2.0' embodies new, what's new? Well, the author: Tom Rath, Global Practice Leader for Workplace and Leadership, and author of great books we will review in time: How full is your bucket?, Strengths Based Leadership. My question to him is: what did you write in this one?<br /><br />Anything else? Yes. The book is a lot lighter, and unfortunately, it really is what they say on the cover: a \\"NEW & UPGRADED Edition of the online test\\"; not a new book. As far as content, you will find:<br /><br />  * a short section explains what strengths are in Clifton/Gallup speak. Section is verbatim the first edition's.<br />  * a longer section describes one by one the 34 strengths from the Clifton StrengthsFinder. It has a lot less content. The litte additional content is already available on the website. As far as \\"real change\\":<br />  ..1. Two strengths have changed name: Consistency became Fairness and Inclusiveness became Includer, but the descriptions remain the same, verbatim.<br />  ..2. The strengths descriptions are a little different from Now, Discover Your Strengths: the \\"Introduction\\" and \\"examples\\" remain the same; the \\"Ideas for action\\" replicate the recommendations you on the website after passing the test, and the \\"Working with others who have...\\" section is a shorter version of Now, Discover Your Strengths \\"Managing Strengths\\" section.<br />  * a passcode, the real core of the book, enables you to pass the test on Gallup site. The test is said to be shorter, but I did not notice a significant difference. It is said the insights are better, but I am not convinced I did get anything that was not in the first book.<br /><br />Enough for the rant. What will you get from this book?<br /><br />In case you would not know the Clifton Strengths Finder, it is the result of a massive study on the workplace that Gallup conducted over the course of 25 years, interviewing millions of people. One of the results, the 34 strengths are patterns that can be combined, in the spirit of architect Christopher Alexander's work The Timeless Way of Building, to create not building and communities but individuals.<br /><br />You will learn two key principles from this study:<br /><br />  * \\"You cannot be anything you want to be.<br />  But you can be a lot more of who you already are.\\"<br />  * Strengths (ability to consistently provide near-perfect performance) = Talent (a natural way of thinking, feeling or behaving) x Investment (time spent practicing, developing your skills, and building your knowledge base)<br /><br />You will learn about the 34 strengths: Achiever, Activator, Adaptability, Analytical, Arranger, Belief, Command, Communication, Competition, Consistency, Context, Deliberative, Connectedness, Developer, Discipline, Empathy, Focus, Futuristic, Harmony, Ideation, Includer, Individualization, Input, Intellection, Learner, Maximizer, Positivity, Relator, Responsibility, Restorative, Self-Assurance, Significance, Strategic, Woo. This is a long list. You do not need to learn them or know them all.<br /><br />You will learn  about your own strengths, how they manifest, and how you can play on them. This awareness will be a great foundation or accelerator for your personal or professional development effort.<br /><br />You will also be sensitized to the diversity of strengths. And you will discover ways to help others contribute as only they can and build productive interactions with them. This is important for anyone who works with others (everyone?), but is critical for a leader or manager.<br /><br />Is this book worth the price?<br /><br />A thousand times yes, if you need to pass the test! The test itself is undeniably 5 stars. It seems to hit the nail every time, and people I have offered it to and debriefed had a feeling of \\"yeah, that's who I am\\", with a little bit of pride: a good basis of awareness and self-acknowledgment. A good gift for people you want to coach or mentor. As for the book, less content really means less outcome and still means less trees. Gallup Boo.<br /><br />In closing, if you do not have Now, Discover Your Strengths, buy Stengths Finder 2.0, just to get a key at a lower cost, and get hold of a copy of Now, Discover Your Strengths, used or at a library, to read the insights of the final section.<br /><br />If you have read Now, Discover Your Strengths and would like to pass the test again to see if these have changed or if the results are consistent, by any means, get Strengths Finder 2.0. It is $10 cheaper, and the insights are worth the price.<br /><br />In both cases, it's just a pity to kill so many trees for so little new content.test! The test itself is undeniably 5 stars.

0385504225|3.0|I am really not as \\"taken\\" with this book as the other two - one of the biggest detractors, for me, is all the terminology (scientific) in the early chapters - I just skimmed over those pages because it was just way too far over my head! This is definitely not a \\"grabber\\" book and for all the hype, very disappointed.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|First off, Hostel unrated has very little to offer. It's a ploy to sell more discs I feel and I'm glad I only borrowed it, otherwise my wallet would have felt pretty darn cheated.     Secondly, it's not that scary. In fact it's boring..... I was asleep faster than Lord of the Rings.     Third, very little gore....WHAT!?! This was supposed to be the goriest flick since Texas Chainsaw Massacre!     The film comes off as a shot at Takashi Miike, who's film \\"Audition\\" freaked the hell out of people in the infamous last fifteen minutes (hand raised I was scared too). The entire film drags out on a hiking trip to Amsterdam and comes off more like porn than actual horror movie, only a few cheap thrills add to the horror atmosphere. Nearly ninety minutes of boobs and sex later, we finally get to the gore. *MAJOR GROAN OF DISAPPOINTMENT*     I will warn you, SPOILERS AHEAD! But believe me, you'll have to agree at least some if you have watched it.     First off, KNB effects is the best in the business when you want the Rolls Royce of Gore. I mean they are the tops with Greg Nicotero, Protege of Tom Savini, helming the guts department. But sadly, their best work winds up in the garbage can here.     The ill-lit \\"torture rooms\\" make the gorey stuff impossible to see, especially that tendon slash scene which looked beautiful in the behind-the-scenes video. Here it was blackened out (WTF?) in the final cut. The scariest tendon slash I've seen and still freaks me out even in the daylight was the Gage Creed hide-under-the-bed-and slash-your-heel-with-a-scalpel from PET SEMETARY. That is one sequence I cannot watch. The other was the pencil-right-between-the-tendon-and-ankle bit from EVIL DEAD. That was scary, I covered my eyes.     Slash with a scalpel in an ill lit room with the obvious green light from Saw? No, I laughing. And I died a little inside because how great effects work was killed by shoddy lighting.     Worse was the autopsy sequence, you can clearly see the fake skinunder the powerful light as it \\"glow's\\" because of the materials translucency (probably silicone or gelatine from what I understand).     Another sequence is where the guy's hiding under the bodies and the body parts are obvious jiggling like jello on the bumps, when they shouldn't as they are supposed to simulate something with bone and should flop. Probably halloween props at best, because KNB's stuff is pretty realistic.     And finally, the eyeball sequence. I felt sorry for that Asian chick that gets her face burned off and having to have her eyeball removed with a pair of scissors. Shame on you Eli, she was such a pretty gal too.      After seeing this film, I've would have done the same as she did: Jump in front of a train at how horrible this film was.     But the greatest travesty was how they invited Miike to appear as a Japanese Business man leaving the torture building near the end. A great director in a shoddy homage to himself? What was he thinking?      The only saving grace was the revenge sequences, which filled my wasted time with a few good chuckles at how I want to hit the people who made this with a car, much like the main did to the people who tricked into the hostel. Then I'll jump in front of that train.
0307269981|5.0|I discovered Stieg Larssen when I bought my Kindle.  His first book was a recommended read.  I fell in love with his writing and his characters.  His second book did not disappoint and I did all kinds of searches to find more books by this author.  Only then did I realize he had passed and we were going to be left with only 3 books to enjoy and savor. I recommend these books be read and savored for their uniqueness and quirky characters. I enjoyed the insight into the scandanavian mindset and worldview that is so different from some of our own.  I recommend this book to anyone who considers themselves an officionado of mysteries. It satisfies on many levels and only disappoints in knowing there are only 3 books to enjoy.
0618918248|5.0|About half way through this read, I definitely thought I had read better.  Its not even as if Dawkins was wrong.  But in comparison to Harris' touching philosophical breakdown of region's evils, Dawkins' refutation of somewhat unsubstantial, 17th century theological design arguments seemed not only dry but lacking in fulfilment given 21st century geo-political ramifications of religious exertion (take 9/11, gay marriage, stem-cell research etc.)    Though his great capacity to dissect religious iterations from religious spokespersons is terribly revealing and very thought provoking, and in some scary ways quite hilarious.    But the later half of the book sums up some of the \\"meat\\" as it were to be an atheist in the modern era, taking offense to the true crimes committed in the name of God, no matter how subtle or seemingly benign today.  Touching commentary on religion's nose being poked where it ought not to go, into private homes to punish homosexuality, and into schools to indoctrinate our innocent children is both chilling and provocative (even if it has been addressed before.)    Most beautifully though is of course Dawkins' perspective.  The absolute reveling in science is to be found in few other sources.  Dawkins not only defends scientific rationalism (which ought not NEED defense amidst the irrational alternative) but it is done so with absolute poetic majesty as he humbly stares at the universe in awe.  He invites us to share with him the spine-tingling amazement of witnessing and learning with him.    His most outstanding point is one of \\"consciousness raising.\\" That the reason these things need to be talked about is precisely why capitulation to creationist \\"shut up\\" arguments is the wrong thing.  Shutting up is the last thing we need to do, and being outspoken is NOT an offense to the cause.    While not the most important defense of \\"godless\\" reasoning per se, it is a triumphant contribution that should be read by anyone interested in the topic, eventhe believer who is willing to suspend faith for reason (a dangerous endeavor indeed). Dawkins is brilliant and well-mannered and well-worded, do yourself the favor and pick it up.
0439023483|5.0|Imagine living in a world where government rules all and freedom is not existent. Where simple necessities such as food and clothing are scarce. Where survival is one breath away from death. This is District 12.    In Suzanne Collin's novel, The Hunger Games, our world of today is no longer. Instead North America was demolished during wars and once they were over The Capitol rose and Panem was born. Thirteen districts were created. All were peaceful, accept District 13, they rebelled and because of that rebellion, District 13 was destroyed. Panem's soul purpose is \\"peace\\", having it's people accept whatever the government sanctions and not questioning it. Making it's people live in fear. Hence the annual Hunger Games.     Ever since the down-fall of District 13, these games have existed. Every year a boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to participate in the Hunger Games. Two are chosen from each district and then thrown into an arena to kill each other. The last one alive, wins. Winning these games also means fortune and food. Which is something wonderful, seeing as most of the twelve districts are dirt poor.    The novel is narrated by Katniss Everdeen, a sixteen year old resident of District 12. She's a fierce protector of her younger sister, Prim. She's also an illegal hunter, doing what she can in the hopes of survival for her family. Her friend and possible love-interest, Gale, hunts and helps with her. Her sister Prim was the actual one chosen for the Hunger Games. But, instead of allowing her sister to go, Katniss intervenes and goes in Prim's place.    The boy chosen from District 12, is Peeta, the baker's son. He's nice, kind, and harbors a crush for Katniss ever since childhood. Katniss doesn't feel the same way, though during the games she plays along.     See, the games are a funny thing. They're all brutality, but they're something else. They're entertainment for the audience. It's reality T.V. at it's worst. Watchers place bets and sponsor strong contestants, (helping them when they are in desperate need of resources). So a basic note of survival is to play a long with a story tacked onto you from the beginning. In Katniss and Peeta's case, they played star-crossed lovers. Although, Katniss doesn't really need any of this backing, she's a survivor through and through.    It's a brutal book, and at times it's terribly hard to read because of the base line it has. Children not only die, but they are killing each other for glory. And yet, I loved this novel.    It's a book that shows both sides of the passed and future. What could happen if the government and the media ruled all. A very scary place. It has hints of the Roman Gladiator games. It even has a little Harry Potter (Goblet of Fire) feel to it, without the magic.    When I read something, it's very rare that I say I feel privileged to read it. But I say this whole-heartily, I feel extremely privileged to read The Hunger Games.     Suzanne Collins, you did literature well!

B000W40PPE|2.0|Fact: Paleo Man didn't drink diet soda. This is the first thing that turned me off about this book. Here Cordain, a big advocate of non-processed foods, states in his rules processed foods are not to be consumed, and then lists diet soda in his meal plans. Technically I guess diet soda isn't food. I'm also thinking warm beverages \\"teas\\" made with various plants were consumed during Paleolithic times, yet tea and coffee (caffeine) is banned. Tea and coffee actually are far less processed than diet soda. (note - I do not consume coffee/caffeine, so I'm not saying this out of personal preference).<br /><br />Fact: Paleo Man did eat legumes and grains. From my anthropology classes I remember evidence of digging tools for gathering roots and tubers. They have grinding tools for grinding the grains they gathered. Evidence of grains and legumes has been found in petrified feces.<br /><br />Fact: Game was scarce at times, unavailable. Granted he states some of the above foods were eaten during hard times, but what evidence that they were only eaten occasionally? During times of scarcity, grains, seeds and roots may have been the only food available.<br /><br />In general the best advice in this book is to eat non-processed whole foods. It is limiting otherwise. Yes, you will lose weight, and if you eat the typical American diet, you will regain some health. Cordain eliminates calorie dense, nutrient deficient foods. Kudos for saying no to refined sugars and grains. But it is far too limiting by banning many healthful foods, and promoting huge amounts of animal flesh. I haven't finished the whole book, but would point out too that Paleolithic man didn't inject game with hormones and antibiotics. I'm hoping he does advocate organic animal protein. Also, the environmental consequences of modern animal (and plant) farming are neglected so far. Maybe this is to come later in the book.
0385504225|2.0|I've started the book on September 15, and have recently finished it. Overall the book is again a Dan Brown's fantastic thriller since I was not able to stop myself reading for more and more until the last chapters. But when everything came to the last chapters, frankly, I was disappointed. I will not enclose the reasons since this is a new book and yet it has not penetrated the market totally; but I'd say don't expect what you had experienced in the Da Vinci Code if you read it. And one last remark. If this book is to be a masterpiece, I'd say it will be, but not literally, rather in marketing. So much has it achieved in marketing, with a various numbers of publishers, the book became available almost all around the World as of September 15. That's what makes it a masterpiece.
B001PA0FFO|2.0|I finally saw this, after reading the rave reviews for months and eagerly anticipating it.  And afterwards I thought, \\"That's it?\\"  I think the people who loved it, loved it because of some excellent acting.  And undeniably, this film is full of excellent acting.  But it doesn't have much else going for it.  A vague, mysterious story, and an ending that only tells you the movie is over--but doesn't answer many questions.    The director (who is also the writer) is fond of ominous portents: strong winds blowing, light bulbs burning out, close-ups of Hoffman's fingernails, students with mysterious angry or smiling faces...  What does it all mean?  Well, nothing.  They're portents for portents' sake, I guess; \\"dramatic\\" scenes that keep the movie from only being an hour long.    And more:  Hoffman confesses to... we're not sure what.  Iron nun Streep suddenly breaks down (right at the end--what wonderful timing!) and confesses to... doubt!  But doubt about what?  Her faith?  Her actions?  Hoffman's guilt?  Agreeing to be in this film?  We're never told.  But it's definitely supposed to be dramatic, because the music swells and the camera pulls way back to show her and Amy Adams in a black, sisterly huddle.      In fact, there's lots of drama in this drama, which makes it all very dramatic.  There just isn't much of a conclusion to the story.  So you're left with a lot of very good acting, which evidently is enough for a lot of people.  I'm not one of them.
0385504225|4.0|Does it really really surprise anyone that this book of Dan Browns is like his other previous two...Demons and Angels and The DaVinci Code?? I mean his star character here is specializes in symbols.  There is only so much you can do with that.  Maybe people expected to much from all the hype this book received.  It was hard not to be to excited about this book.  I didn't really expect anything different than similar characters, symbols, running around a historical town, and the Masons.  I thought the book was a roller coaster going from exciting event into a downplay of explaining of symbols...then tower into excitement only to downspin into another few pages of explaination.  That might be my only complaint was all the explaining.  The book was quite long (over 400 pages), but the time span of this book was 12 hours or so.  Thats alot of explaining to be doing.  I do like reading about the historical aspect of his novels, but being a Christian it is hard sometimes to just roll my eyes and overlook the religious overtones (that I find incorrect) in his books.      If you like his other books you will enjoy this the same, but only if you didn't get sucked into all the hype.  It was good, but not as good as the hype made it out to be.

SEE THE BOTTOM FOR DIFFERENCES OF THE 2 STRAIGHT FROM THE TURTLE BEACH WEBSITE.<br />==========================================================================================================<br /><br />I bought this based on someone talking about it in a SOCOM match. The reviews here also were good. First off, I don't have a true surround system. You really need that when playing shooter type games to hear where your enemy is around you. This headset does a pretty good job in helping you locate the enemy. But it is far from perfect. First off, its not built that well for the price. In \\"Stereo Expander\\" mode there is a loud background hiss. Chat Boost does not work at all. The quality of the headphone speakers are what you would expect from a $[...] pair of headphones. I know headphone quality, I have headphones ranging in price from $[...] to $[...]. And one of the most annoying things about this headset is the noise the plastic makes every time you move your head. All that being said, you can hear much more in a game then you would normally. I play SOCOM and my gameplay got better because now I can hear people walking around and tell which direction they are from me. The increase in my score was enough that if offsets all the negative things about this headset.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />Long Cord<br />Easy Set Up<br />Helps you locate the enemy in shooter games<br />Separate game and voice volume controls<br />Bass Boost works moderately well<br />Seems sturdy enough to last awhile<br />You can turn the mic off<br />Good for when you want to not play and wake people up<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />Background hiss in expanded mode<br />Materials make noise whenever you move<br />Sound quality not that great<br />Earphone cups are a little small<br />Chat Boost doesn't work, at least not in [[ASIN:B001C4DKG4 SOCOM: US Navy Seals Confrontation Stand Alone]]<br /><br />Overall, if you don't have surround and play shooter type games I recommend it. Otherwise, I would not bother.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Keep an eye on the metal pin that holds the clip in place. It barely locks in and can work its way out.

B002GZQYMK|2.0|I'll keep this review short and sweet. I am not a die hard Muse fan...picked up \\"Absolution\\" on a spending spree and liked it a lot. Picked up \\"Black Holes...\\" and looovved it. Always would describe them to friends as, \\"a harder, better Radiohead\\".   Release day for \\"Resistance\\" was met with much anticipation, but unfortunately it seems that this band has decided to follow a path that trends them more toward being Radiohead, Jr. than becoming THE ONLY MUSE!! Greatly disappointed :(
0307408833|4.0|I've read lots of bad reviews about this cookbook, but I have to say that overall I absolutely love it!  I won't go into all the merits of the graphics and how fun it is to read, etc, but I'll focus more on the recipes. I've made several things out of the book and all except the frosting have turned out great. Here are the things I've had easy success with: chocolate chip cookies, double choc. chip cookies, blueberry muffins (think I used blackberries), red velvet cupcakes, vanilla cupcakes, spelt biscuits, and blondies.  I had no problems with any of these and will make them all again and already have made some again.  One tip I've found...I always set any baked good to cook at less time than the recipe says...I just like my baked goods more chewy than others I guess.  Anyway, you can always add more time on if it isn't cooked, but it helps you not to overcook b/c some ovens run different. I've also made the johnny cakes...those came out tasting good, but were too dry...I'd add more water next time to those.    Why I give this book 4 instead of 5 stars...  1) the frosting. I have made the frosting twice.  The first time was an overwhelming disaster and I followed instructions to a T. They are pretty simple, after all. The second time, I used the measurements on the Martha Stewart website and the frosting came out much better, but I still don't think it came out right.  It came out good enough that I'll try again and make some tweaks of my own, but with so many recipes in this book using the frosting/sauce, this recipe is too integral to not work right.   2) I'm pretty disappointed that this isn't the actual recipe that they use in the bakery...in fact, I was disappointed that it looks like several, if not most, of the recipes aren't exactly the same as in the bakery. I feel that is a misleading, especially in light of the way that Erin describes the frosting in the cookbook - it sounds like the recipe in the book is the \\"real\\" one, but it's not. (You can check outthe list of ingredients on her blog - they are very different.) I am especially disappointed and frustrated with the soy milk powder that the frosting calls for. On the list of ingredients used in the bakery, neither soy milk powder nor rice milk powder (nor any kind of milk powder for that matter) are on the list. This elusive product has had dozens of people in fits looking for it and it is expensive for something that is not even used in the original recipe.  3) The challenge it was to find all the products. While this may be part of gluten-free cooking, with all the resources she puts in the cookbook, there were a few obvious things that consumed a lot of my time trying to figure out that could have been included.  In the list of ingredients at the beginning, it would have been nice to know that evaporated cane \\"juice\\" are crystals, not a liquid.  I went to every store in town looking for this in all the wrong places.   I finally found it in the bulk bins at Whole Foods and sometimes it is called other names.  Just look on the back of the ingredients and the only ingredient listed should say \\"evaporated cane juice\\". The other \\"biggie\\" to me is not telling us to heat the coconut oil. Having never cooked with it before, this wasn't obvious to me, especially as those of us who use crisco on the rare occasion do not heat that up for baked goods. I do really appreciate the resource sections that Erin includes, just wish there were a little more there to help with some of these recipes.    Overall, I do love this cookbook, but I would only recommend it with hesitation.  You kind of have to go into buying it if you know you're committed to using it and cooking with these alternative products.  If the rest of the recipes weren't coming out so well, I would have given if 2 or 3 stars for the disappointment of the above mentioned factors.
0307341569|4.0|Libby Day, the sole survivor of a murderous massacre that killed her family, has spent the rest of her life trying to avoid that night. Her brother is imprisoned for the crime. Libby has become a dysfunctional adult, and having exhausted her trust fund, finds herself in need of money. Her rather unorthodox solution is to investigate the night of the murders funded by the Kill Club, a group of crime junkies. In the process Libby is brought into contact with all the horrors of that fateful January night. In the process Libby finds herself reevaluating everything she thought she knew about the crime. She also digs deeper than she eer anticipated and finds herself coming too close to a murderer still on the loose. This was a gripping story. It kept me invested from start to finish. The mix of thriller and literary fiction was refreshing- I like a good thriller, but I also want good writing, and this book definitely has both. Flynn offers us plot development, fully rounded characters, and enough suspense to keep the reader on edge.
B002BIULQC|5.0|This was a great movie.  My girls, 8 and 11 loved it.  It had a great message (a little unrealistic ending)but a movie that Daddy did not mind watching with the girls too.  My girls are tired of the animation movies, this movie is not animated but children will love it and enjoy it for years.
0307269981|2.0|...after the first racy, convincing tome, I couldn't wait to read the sequel.....but it was disappointing (isn't that always the case?). As racy as the first, but by far tooooo many coincidences to be convincing!! Some Popeye just always happened to be on the scene to rescue the damsels in distress (scuse my mixed metaphers!)The damsels - esp. our weird and wondrous Lisbeth Salander - always managed to get out of the stickiest spots. Reeeelatively unscathed...<br />Teachy, laboured and ponderous in parts, I skipped many paragraphs....<br />Too many characters again AND ... all their biographies and breakfast cereal preferences described in detail!!<br />This could be the stuff of a TV series - about 150 installments - by the time they cover each character with all their foibles and fancies - but far too much detail for one book!!<br />Disappointing......BUT I've already ordered the third tome......

B002GZQYMA|5.0|First of all, there is not one tiny little thing wrong with this album. It is their best work. It proves the raw genius of Matthew Bellamy. Every song is in it's correct place on this album because that is where the COMPOSER wanted it. It should not be rearranged or anything of the sort \\"are you people retarded?\\" This album is fun, moving, beautiful and down right amazing. The Exogenesis Symphany is without a doubt the most beautiful piece of music my ears have ever heard. The entire album is pure music genuis.     I give this infinite stars!!
076790592X|5.0|This was the first Mitch Albom book I ever read and it did not disappoint.  I was shocked to know this guy whom I've seen on ESPN is one of the better writers I've ever read.  It seems as though every single word was perfectly placed in this book.  It must have had about 30 edits.<br />Great story, great writing.  Very moving and impressive work of art!
0307266303|5.0|This book was great.  I am not much of a reader and probably haven't read more than 3 books in the last 15 years but found this one very difficult to put down.  It has a great history of human running form and running shoe development as well as quite an entertaining story about the Tarahumara.      I was turned onto this book after seeing McDougall's Daily Show interview and listening to how he was able to transform himself from an ever-injured runner.  A lot of what he talks about as issues most runner's face makes a lot of sense and has led me to do a great deal of research into my own running style.  Over-all, a great read and highly recommended.
0553582038|4.0|I was very much expecting to hate A Feast for Crows (hereafter: AFC) based on things I'd heard, but I was pleasantly surprised - I would term AFC to be Martin's strongest novel in the series since A Clash of Kings. While it's certainly not perfect, it does set up the series for an exciting 5th volume.    Here's the basic plot: With the death of Balon Greyjoy, the ironborn are left without a leader, and hold the first kingsmoot in milennia to choose their new king - and the one they choose will set off events that will forever alter the course of the Iron Islands and Westeros itself; at the same time, in the wake of Tywin Lannister's murder, Cersei Lannister assumes the regency of the Iron Throne and consolidates her power in ever darker ways; Jaime Lannister, haunted by the guilt and revelations left in the wake of Tyrion's escape, finds himself drifting further and further away from who and what he thought he was; Arya Stark, now in Braavos, begins training as a Faceless Man; a vengeful plot to overthrow the Iron Throne stirs in Dorne; Samwell Tarly is sent, with Gilly and Maester Aemon, to the Citadel in Oldtown to begin his education as a maester of the Wall; Sansa Stark, in her guise as Alayne, watches Petyr Baelish play a nimble game of thrones in the Eyrie; and Brienne, the Maid of Tarth, sets out on her quest to find Sansa Stark, wherever she may be.    The Good: As always, despite the telephone book size of this volume and a sizable cast of characters worthy of Tolstoy, Martin manages to move the book along at a breakneck pace and cover tremendous amounts of ground, while at the same time expounding on some new topics in the land of Westeros. While we see little or nothing of Jon Snow, Bran Stark, Davos Seaworth, Daenerys, Tryion and others, we somehow don't miss them - Martin introduces some new Point of View Characters like Brienne of Tarth and Cersei (among others) that really add to the overall feel of the story. AFC is essentially a set-up volume in thetradition of Stephen King's [[ASIN:0451210875 Wizard and Glass (The Dark Tower, Book 4)]], which didn't move the plot along but instead set up events for a devastating climax - which seems where the Seven Kingdoms are headed. While there are fewer of Martin's trademark reversals of fortune in this volume, those that do come up are shocking and, in some cases, exceptionally well done.    The Bad: Again, this isn't a perfect book. While Martin introduces some new POV characters, with several of them he only has one or two chapters with them before he dismisses them completely; this renders them essentially bloodless and one wonders why he tried this tack in the first place. Also, while it's great to finally have a POV for Cersei Lannister, Martin doesn't seem to do all he could with the character: Cersei remains the character you love to hate, but her POV doesn't expose any redeeming or human elements, as Jaime's did; instead, Cersei just comes off as a scheming, increasingly paranoid harpy for the most part. Also, unfortunately, this book also contains several typos, which were annoying.    For those fans of the series who are wondering whether or not they should go ahead and read A Feast for Crows, I offer a definite \\"Yes.\\" It is necessary reading in preparation for A Dance with Dragons (whenever it's going to be released).
0385504225|3.0|I read this book with an open mind, that was quickly bored.  There were interesting and somewhat exciting moments but as a total this book seemed to be a weak copy of the earlier Robert Langdon books.  The story was easy to predict and and some of the characters seemed to be a cliche.  All in all this was a book that you can wait for the paperback to purchase.
0061766089|3.0|I was drawn to this book because of the innovation reputation of Tim Brown and also with the possibility that he might see change management as a worthy outcome or release of a culture of innovation.  Instead, the heavy emphasis on this book is \\"By Design,\\" ironically distanced, by design, on the cover from the word \\"Change.\\"    This is a book to jump-start innovation, first, foremost, and completely.    If it weren't for the author's concept he details in the book, I would assume that an editor or publisher picked the title of this book rather than Mr. Brown himself.  However, if he was true to the method of which he innovates, he probably developed the title first, then the content.      So, the title is a bit of a miss, but that's really the worst thing that can be said critically of this book.  It's not a book that will help you consider innovation to navigate change in your company.  As a stretch, if you want to change the culture of your company from a stodgy organization to a gang of free-wheeling hipsters, perhaps the title makes sense, and maybe that was Mr. Brown's point.  If it was, though, that was so subtle that such a thing would have been a bigger miss than a misaligned title.    The content clearly is brain food for integrating more innovation into your company, as well as the value you can create by doing so.    Mr. Brown is the head of IDEO, itself a gang of free-wheeling hipsters.  He has received considerable coverage over the years, in other business books and on television, for the innovative culture at his company.  Authors who consider customer service an experience or espouse the value of creativity in an organization probably borrowed ideas from Mr. Brown at the very least and, often, wrote about IDEO's legacy in detail.    So, here you have a company famous for innovation and a book written by the CEO of that company.  It's not the first time IDEO has been profiled in a business book, but this profile comes straight from the company's leader.  If IDEO is new to you and you want to be part of the \\"with it innovation crowd,\\" learning from legends who have come before you, by all means read this book.      However, if you've read about IDEO, you've already read much of this book.  There aren't more take-aways.  In fact, this would be a great book for the company to give to every prospective IDEO client, sort of a \\"why us?\\" document, and that most likely will become it's long-lasting purpose.  I'm sure every employee will be given a copy of the book and, again, if you aspire to perhaps work at IDEO, read the book before the interview.    If you think your company is an innovation slump and IDEO is a new company to you, the book's worth your time.  If it changes your focus on one thing, it's probably well worth the $19.

0385504225|1.0|I kept waiting for the plot to twist but the entire storyline is telegraphed from the beginning.  The hope that the ending would somehow be enlightening or entertaining and make up for hundreds of pages that do nothing to advance the storyline was also in vain.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I know, I know . . . implausable plot, lots of detail, way too many characters, and who cares about how you drive from one unpronouncable district in Sweden to another? . . . but I liked it anyway!  What a feisty, crazy, relentless protagonist is Lisbeth Salander, and what fun to be carried along with her while she metes out justice for some well-deserved few, for good or evil, who have personally encountered her unique code of morality.  It was an exciting ride and a great read.  I was disappointed to find that the author Stieg Larsson died in 2003 with only three manuscripts completed.  I look forward to the next novel in the series as well as (hopefully) any upcoming movies starring ... Angelina? . . Winona? . . Hilary??  Stay tuned.

0671027344|5.0|I honestly don't understand how people think so lowly of this book that they must give it 1 star... But to each his own...<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of my favorite books for so many reasons.<br />I really like the fact that we don't know who \\"Charlie\\" is writing to, because it just leaves more room to think. Or what anyone's real name is; it shows that their names don't really matter. We can identify with the characters no matter what they are called.<br />I also really like Charlie, because I think the introvert inside of all of us can relate to him. Everyone, especially us teenagers, has times where we feel awkward and lonely and depressed. But we also have those amazing moments, where we truly do feel infinite just like Charlie.<br />I find Charlie's simple appreciations and innocence very admirable, and it's one of the reasons why I like him so much.<br />As for the people who say that this book addresses too many issues and simply drops them, this book isn't supposed to be about just one certain issues directed at a certain audience. To me, this book is addressing human nature and life itself, as cliche as that sounds.<br />People also complain about the way Charlie uses quotation marks whenever he uses slang. I'm pretty sure Chbosky didn't put those there because he wasn't sure how to use them. He was there in the early 90s, too. He knows how it worked. I feel that Charlie used those quotations again showing his awkward side, and the way CHARLIE wasn't sure of them. Keep in mind that he uses correct grammar. There are teenagers who know what that is.<br /><br />Also, for people who may skip epilogues (why?!): The epilogue is, I feel, important to the story if you feel like you want to be able to identify him even more. As he says, it's not made him who he is today... but I feel that it definitely puts some pieces together.
0385340575|3.0|I enjoyed this novel a lot more than I was expecting to.  I'm generally not a fan of \\"Big Action\\" novels and films. I started one Reacher novel (Die Trying) a few years ago and couldn't finish it.  It just didn't work for me.  But overall I found Gone Tomorrow to be pretty entertaining.  I suspect some hardcore action fans will find that the plot moves a little too slowly for their tastes, but strangely, this is one of the things I liked about the novel.  I tend to get bored by big action scenes (car chases, big explosions and the like) and I was glad that the plot wasn't just something to fill a few pages between action sequences.<br /><br />The plot itself is pretty thin though and is the reason I can't give this novel more than 3 stars.  Gone Tomorrow is essentially a MacGuffin driven plot (a MacGuffin - for those unfamiliar with the term - is an object that the good guys and bad guys both want.  It drives the plot of a movie or novel.  Cynical writers/directors will say that it doesn't really matter what the MacGuffin is, so long as the reader/audience understands that it is of great importance that the characters in the novel/film get their hands on it.<br /><br />I know it shouldn't matter what the MacGuffin turns out to be, since its only purpose is to motivate the good guys and bad guys to take action.  It's supposed to be about the unravelling (to a certain point) of the mystery, the thrill of the chase, and the excitement of the inevitable confrontation. And I did enjoy those things - but to a large degree (for me at least) it was contingent on the MacGuffin turning out to be something that makes sense.  Often in movies or novels the MacGuffin is destroyed or lost before the reader/audience finds out what it is, and this happens to a degree in Gone Tomorrow.<br /><br />The MacGuffin in Gone Tomorrow is a thumb drive that is believed to hold a military file that may contain a photo that could ruin the political career of an aspiring US Senator.  Reacher can only speculate on what is in the file based on what the aspiring Senator has told him and what he is able to deduce for himself, but he never actually sees what is on the thumb drive (and therefore, neither does the reader).  I suppose I could assume that whatever was in the photo, it was clearly worthwhile for al-Qaida to pursue.  Except that the only options I can think of, make absolutely no sense to me*.<br /><br />The bottom line:  this is a reasonably entertaining thriller that I, for the most part, enjoyed taking for a ride, however it's built on a shaky foundation.  When the cracks are revealed at the end it proved a little disappointing to me.  I suspect that the majority of fans of the author will enjoy this novel, although some `action junkies' may complain that it is a bit too slow at time - too much talkin' not enough shootin' (although I didn't find that myself).<br /><br />*WARNING: In the comment section I am going to explain why I feel that the premise of the novel makes no sense.

0385504225|5.0|The long-awaited Lost Symbol by Dan Brown has finally appeared.  Does it live up to its hype?  Yes!  Is it a fun read?  Yes!  It is great literature?  No, but it's not supposed to be.  Does it emulate Brown's successful pattern from Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons?  Yes!  Is it predictable in that sense?  Sorta!  Will it make a fun movie?  Yes!      It's not clear from some of the other reviews what some people were expecting, but they should know by now that Brown is not another Steinbeck, Hemingway, Wolfe, or Melville, nor is he trying to be.  He's a writer of fun-to-read novels that make the reader wonder about things around him or her.  He probably isn't writing now because he needs the money (not after the success of his previous works!); he's apparently writing because it's as much fun for him as it is for us readers -- at least those of us who don't expect him to produce something that he isn't even trying to produce.    So, sit down and enjoy it, but maybe after you align your expectations to what Dan Brown was trying to produce.  You definitely won't fall asleep!  And you'll learn some interesting things about our nation's capital, Washington, DC, just as you learned things about London, Paris, Rome, and other European cities from his last two novels.  Europe definitely does not have a monopoly on mysteries!  Nor does the Catholic Church!
1934648035|3.0|A Western take on the Buddhist quest for enlightenment, Hesse's novel presents a very self-indulgent character who shirks responsibility to others as a means of elevating himself.  Viewing love as \\"child-like\\" and a source of suffering, Siddhartha casts away parents, friend, lover, child.  While some kernels of wisdom are made accessible, much is obscured by the translation.  Riddled with syntactical errors, typos, and verb agreement errors, the text is more clunky than beautiful or profound.
0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown's latest book has come out and sold a lot of copies and I went out and got mine. I read annoyingly fast, so I finished it in four or five hours total (I would love to know what reading level this is supposed to be, Harry Potters book 4-7 all took longer than this). It made me decide that I don't need to read any more Dan Brown books.     I loved Angels & Demons, I thought it was a great story and had some great controversies that really made me think. I thought Da Vinci Code was okay. I thought Deception Point was somewhere in between the two Langdon books, and this one would go below that.    His books are incredibly formulaic. This one contains someone Langdon knows getting into trouble, him working with a woman to solve the mystery and save the other person, a security officer with authority that Langdon does not trust, and a bad guy who hurts himself and does it all for a higher power. Do any of those sound familiar? Also, his watch is referenced several times, he gets trapped or has to travel through many small spaces, and at one point, it looks like he is dead! There are even more similarities including God vs science, what religion is, and many more.    Please Dan Brown, think of something new! These books all seem to be the same!    I was looking forward to this book quite a lot for one reason - the setting. Washington DC is one of my favorite cities and I was looking forward to knowing a lot about the locations that were in the book (plus, Langdon traveling from Harvard to DC made a lot of sense). In that, I was not disappointed. I learned more about two famous DC landmarks and when they traveled on The Metro, I knew exactly where they were at all times.     I also am interested in Freemasons. I knew someone in college that was one 9only the 5th or 6th level) and while he couldn't tell us most things, what he told me about his beliefs was very interested, so I was excited that they would be a central part of this story. That also was not a disappointment. I did learn quite a bit about the beliefs.    Those two things could not save the book. Dan Brown just needs to write better (and his editors need do more). If a better writer had written this book, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. If you liked his first Langdon books, you may be disappointed because it is so similar, which really, in the end, was my main disappointment. I think Robert Langdon has a lot of potential as an interesting character to build a series on, but there needs to be more differences.     Don't necessarily take my word for it. Go form an opinion of your own!
B002P1YEY0|2.0|Dan Brown's book, as usual, contains adventure, architecture, anticipation, the astuteness of details.  As you read descriptions of characters, atmosphere, famous places, and action, you literally receive a visual as if your mind has became a movie screen filled with glorious color and movement.  As entertainment, The Lost Symbol is pure escapist fun.  Unfortunately, that fun became increasingly disrupted with the characters' ramblings straight from an ancient cult called The Gnostics.  This errant philosophy started around the time of Christ, and endures today.  Mr. Brown has a right to insert his persoanl philosophy into his writings as any author does, but there really needs to be a \\"warning\\" alert about this book.  Book burnings are just wrong, but to read this book without a critical analyzing process would also be wrong.  Gnostics worshipped knowledge above God, and believed that mankind should create God/god and then supercede Him/him through enlightenment.  The Judeo-Christian God was on the same level as the gods that the Greeks and romans invented.  The more knowledge a person has, the more god-like he becomes; until finally he is god!  At the very least, such a theology is arrogant.  It says that the pot is equal or superior to the potter who forms it from the clay.  If you enjoy a suspensful mystery, this book is for you, but if you prefer Judeo-Christian values, that theology is lost!
0385504225|2.0|The overall feeling is that Dan Brown wrote this book by formula and random sentence generators.  Want to recreate the effect?  Try this:  1)  Select an old city (>200 years old)  2)  Obtain random facts about monuments in (old city) and the artwork therein;  3)  Select a secret society at random;  4)  Google \\"(old city) conspiracy\\" and take the most popular and the list popular hits.  Ready?  Here's your dust jacket summary:    Langdon meets a member of (secret society) who calls him to (old city) where he must solve the ancient mystery of (conspiracy theory #1) by driving from monument to monument based on his knowledge of (obscure fact) finding (art object) at each monument.  Ultimately, Langdon will discover that (secret society) is really protecting the secret of (conspiracy theory #2) by making it so that only its members can REALLY understand the hidden meaning in the art.

B0007Q6PBK|3.0|I eagerly anticipated receiving this DVD in the mail and, when I did, I immediately popped it into the DVD player. I was disappointed. Pavarotti's singing, particularly in \\"Che gelida manina,\\" is not inspiring. He was weak on the High-C and just seemed generally off his usual standard. Renata Scotto's portrayal of Mimi was particularly unconvincing in that there is no way that a woman of that size could ever be consumptive. Her singing seemed shrill, as well. The supporting cast was strong but, again, they did not seem to fit their parts (with the delightful exception of Italo Tajo as Benoit). Levine's conducting is wonderful.    So what to do? If I were to make a recommendation of a Met performance, I would recommend the Zeffirelli production with Teresa Stratas and Jose Carreras. Many might say that Carreras' weak top is a downside, but I think it is more than made up for by his rich voice and wonderful acting.
B000OPPSXK|5.0|Mozart (or Haydn) must not be given up to period specialists. Symphony orchestras more and more tend toward a niche program of exclusively romantic and post-romantic repertoire: from Beethoven to Sibelius and everything in between, with extra stops at Mahler and Shostakovich.<br /><br />But baroque music and increasingly classical period music as well are left to the devices of specialized performance groups - usually those that offer some form of Historically Informed Performance Practice (HIP).<br /><br />The proliferation of original instrument - and modern instrument HIP - groups is a boon to music. But if their prominence in Monteverdi, Marais, and even Mozart comes at the expense of important composers and periods being part of the repertoire of `regular' symphony orchestras, then alarm bells should ring for two reasons.<br /><br />Sure, Mozart and Haydn and Bach sound different when a large symphonic orchestra (even with reduced forces) is at work. But that isn't bad at all, it's desirable diversity. HIP is to add to our enjoyment by offering comparison and choice - not by replacing the way we've heard this music for so long.<br /><br />To illustrate the high quality of music-making that can result from this approach (one we might run the danger of losing), nothing serves better than Josef Krips' recordings of the Mozart Symphonies with the Concertgebouw Orchestra from 1972 and 73. This is Classical Music at its very finest. You won't find Mozart anywhere else that is played with such lightness, radiating joy, and so being the epitome of musical tip-toeing. Yes, it sounds very different - luxuriously so - than Mozart coming from smaller, HIP groups, but not heavier per se, nor swooningly romantic.<br /><br />Krips covers symphonies 21 to 41 and they are finally available separately again after having long shared box-set space with the unnecessary Neville Marriner-conducted early symphonies. Even with the excellent, moderately HIP Charles Mackerras / Prague set (Teldec) available, Krips should still be the first choice of any collection's allotment for Mozart symphonies.<br /><br />(from Classical WETA)hould still be the first choice of any collection's allotment for Mozart symphonies.

B0025KVLV0|4.0|From the beginning, The Beatles expected their group to only last a few short years, and though they managed to stay together a little longer than that, their duration as a band still seems brief in light of their tremendous impact on music and culture. The Let It Be album, though not the last material they recorded in studio, is the last that was released and bears the markings of a band on the brink of break-up. Weariness and strain show through in the relative drop in creativity and lively performances (especially telling as this is a \\"live\\" album). But since this is arguably the greatest band ever, the material here has real highlights and is equivilent to some of the best albums produced by other artists. The first song \\"Two of Us\\" almost seems metaphorical of the partnership between Lennon and McCartney and is one of my favorite tunes they produced. \\"Dig a Pony\\" and \\"I Me Mine\\" definately feel like productions of a jam session, clips like \\"Dit It\\" being exactly that. On the other hand, John Lennon's serene \\"Across the Universe\\" is the product of meditation sessions and is reputed to be one of his most overlooked songs. \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" and \\"Get Back\\" are great rockers, and the the title song of the album is the real standout of the track list. Phil Spector often gets a bad rap for his production of this album, and while I don't necessarily dislike his symphonic and choral additions, I think they do feel awkward behind what is basically a rock jam session. Suprising to me is that Paul McCartney was the only member of the group to vocalize a distate for his treatment of their music and that his opinion is by-in-large the reason we have Let It Be . . . Naked, which some prefer. I prefer this version for the performances and the remaster.
B000002KON|5.0|I had this album when it first came out.  Each song reflects some phase of British development from Victoria to suburbia.  It was never very popular in the US, maybe because most Americans couldn't relate... except for one song.  \\"Some Mother's Son\\" is by far one of the most poignant anti-war songs of its day and even now.  It isn't blatantly and judgmentally against war, but it reminds one of the realities of what a soldier's death means to those left behind. Ray Davies is one of the best at walking the thin line between biting sarcasm and just plain excellent observation of life around him.
B0007GAEGC|2.0|Had to see what all the buzz was about when getting this CD for my wife for Christmas.  I was not overly impressed.  80% of the songs on this album have an orchestal accompanyment rather than a celtic one. \\"May It Be\\" is nicely done in celtic musical style, but the rest of this album is forgetable. TRUE celtic music can easily be found elsewhere, and if you are looking for it here, like me you will be sorely disappointed.  The magical music of Secret Garden or Yanni makes Celtic Woman look amateurish and very cheesy by comparison.  Sorry, these babes just don't do it for me.  Worthy of 2 stars, and that's being generous.
B001CXGPL2|4.0|Roy Hargrove has been wildly inconsistent. However, Earfood is right on time. It is as if these guys have been playing together for a while rather than just put together for a studio blowing session. There are no clunkers here. Each tune is a delight. I hope Hargrove continues to make such excellent music.
0385504225|4.0|I agree with many of the previous reviewers...there are aspects of this book that I had a hard time getting past. The running back and forth conversation with the stereotypical CIA hard-nosed deputy director got very old, very fast.  At times, it felt like the start of the book was in fact a rehash of National Treasure...but with Robert Langdon playing the role of Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage).  The first quarter of the book was relatively slow...but set the stage for an explosive run for the finish.    Unlike the Da Vinci code, I could not get into the excitement of running around Washington, D.C.  Granted, there are lots of great and interesting tid-bits to take away about our Nation's capital.  However, there is something to be said about escaping (in a book) to France than to D.C.  The long time spent under the Capitol started to tax my commitment to the book, and Langdon left there just in time to maintain my interest.  Just as I'm sure the air is stale, this portion of the book started to pick up the same scent.    Once Langdon got out from the Capitol, however, the book really starts to pick up steam.  The plot lines suddenly started to make sense and weave together.  Each character's past begins to intertwine with one another and the curtain is raised on an exciting novel...classic Dan Brown.  Suddenly it felt like I was back in a Dan Brown book...rapid pace, exciting story, a mix of history/historical novel and money well spent.  I was happy to see Brown still had that magic which made Angels and Demon and The Da Vinci Code two of my favorite novels.  While its hard to compare this book to The Da Vinci Code, the elements of Brown's storytelling, fast pace and the character of Robert Langdon all made it worth while.  Do not worry if you find yourself slowing down at the start of the book...it will take off like a rocket.  All I can say, in true Dan Brown fashion, is hang on for the ride!     On a side note, I read this book on my Amazon Kindle (Generation 1...old school!).  Turned it on the morning of the 15th and was excited to see the new book download right onto my Kindle.  Amazon, I'm hooked on my Kindle!
0812551508|4.0|Written in the early 19th century, Frankenstein is a novel that is fairly easy to read and find entertainment value in even by today's standards. The rich language and Shelley's authorial style create an environment that allows the reader to totally submerse themselves into Victor's world.<br /><br />The story itself is presented as a story within a story within a story (an sometimes even a level or two deeper than that) as a ship captain named Walton writes letters to his sister in England about his voyage across the top of the world and the strange tale of the man (Victor Frankenstein) that he encounters there. It is Victor's story that occupies most of the novel, and though most modern readers are aware of the Hollywood version of the famous Frankenstein monster, those unfamiliar with the actual novel version are in for a great surprise in the way that the creature is depicted in the novel. Hollywood has taken so many liberties with this tale and the depictions of the characters that reading the original is almost like opening one's mind to entirely new material. Shelley presents us with an incredibly thought provoking and fleshed out tale requiring the reader to put some serious thought into the morality of intense scientific research in the area of the creation of life.<br /><br />With this novel, Shelley opened the door to the later development of the Science Fiction genre. In a move that is almost pure genius, Shelley avoids the need for the reader to have to suspend belief in the scientific method used to create another living being from dead tissue by allowing Victor to keep his methods undisclosed for fear that another scientist will follow his direction and make the same mistakes that he did in creating his monster.<br /><br />All in all a very good novel!
B000ZELISO|1.0|I'm a great fan of the books and the first four movies.  I was sorely disappointed in David Yates' adaptation of The Order of the Phoenix and afraid he'd do as poorly with The Half Blood Prince.    As a bit of background, I re-read Order of the Phoenix before seeing the movie and was, probably, more disappointed than I might have been had I not been as familiar with the text at the time I saw the movie.  At that point I made a vow not to re-read Half Blood Prince before going to the movie.  Unfortunately, it was a vow I was unable to keep.  I read the book, aloud, with a friend, just before going to the movie.  I should have known something was up when I was able to show up at the theatre on the first weekend of the film's opening and just buy two tickets for the same day (I live in NYC)!    The books get darker as the series progresses and Half Blood Prince is the darkest yet.  There are so many things in the book that serve to set up The Deathly Hallows and so few of them were actually portrayed, or portrayed well, in the film.  I was devastated to learn that David Yates was directing the last two films, as I was so unhappy with Order of the Phoenix, however, \\"unhappy\\" doesn't come close to the way I felt after actually seeing Half Blood Prince.    I question whether Yates has ever read the books (and if he did, did he like them???) or if he only read the treatment for the scripts?  There are several places in the book that cause me to not just cry, but to weep.  I wondered if I could make it through the movie and not look like a complete dishrag when I left.  I believe this will illustrate my feelings fairly well:  When the credits rolled, I looked at my friend and said, \\"So, where do you want to eat?\\"      I don't believe I shed one tear and I think that says it all.  If you want more: you know how die-hard fans always stay for the credits?  Almost the entire theatre got up and walked out as the credits began to roll.    Will I buy this 1-star DVD?  Yes, I wantto complete my collection and I continue to have hopes that the two-part ending will, somehow, be better--although with David Yates at the helm, I very much doubt it.  What a shame.
0307266303|5.0|One of my favorite things about Born to Run is how the author explores several technical myths (mostly perpetuated by athletics companies) about exactly what you need to do in order to be a great distance runner, and dispels them.  I've been a casual runner ever since my late teens, but I've never been able to get beyond the 8-mile mark due to some knee and hip problems. Information in this book led me to restructure my form and diet after a long break from running, and now I'm doing 6 miles a couple times a week and my old joint issues haven't so much as reared their heads. I'm training for my first half-marathon in November, and I plan on doing a full one soon thereafter if all goes well.    But the technical stuff only occupies the smallest percentage of what this book is all about, and isn't the best reason to check it out. Not by a long shot.    Born to Run is, at it's heart, an adventure story. It's hard to imagine a book about distance running being very exciting, but Christopher McDougall's (completely true) account is full of so much action, it could be made into a Hollywood blockbuster. From his surprisingly dynamic and exciting descriptions of the few footraces he chronicles in the book, to the close-call brushes with death the characters must face (among them some chilling encounters with territorial drug traffickers), this book is as entertaining as any novel I've ever read. Near the end of the book when the author describes the race mentioned in the title, I swear it was like watching Top Gun for the first time when I was a kid.    And yet that's not all this book has to offer.    Born to Run has the power not only to make you love running, but to spark in you a greater love for being human and humanity as a whole. McDougall makes an extremely powerful case for several novel ideas, among them that the ability to run for extremely long distances (a very unique ability in the animal kingdom, and indeed the major one that sets us apart from other creatures, second only to our intellect in importance) was the primary reason for our species' success in it's earliest infancy. He also suggests to us that because running is so intimately tied to our survival as a species, it is also intimately tied to our most important emotion for survival: Love. Love is by far the biggest theme evident in this book, and it doesn't seem at all like a coincidence that it shines through to an amazing degree in the personalities of each and every one of the athletes mentioned. Love of life, love of running, love of others, love of self.    To sum it all up, this is a truly three-dimensional work of literature that had a profound effect on me. Intellectually, it changed the way I think about the human race, our origins, and our place in the world. Physically, it gave me information that allowed me to improve my performance as a runner and aim higher as an athlete. And spiritually, it reinforced the lessons of unity, compassion, peace, and brotherhood that great men and women have been trying to teach us for thousands of years which still, somehow, get pushed to the wayside when we look for the easy way out.    Best $20 I ever spent.

B0028NSE3M|5.0|Though he had been part of the famed Stax sound for a number of years, having also co-written the Sam & Dave hits \\"Hold On (I'm Comin') and \\"Soul Man\\", Isaac Hayes really broke into his own with an album that, right out of the chute in 1969, was identified as an R&B masterpiece, and one that showed at least one direction of where the genre would go into the 1970s--HOT BUTTERED SOUL.    The original release of this album contained only four songs on it, two of them being extremely extended takes of Jimmy Webb's \\"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\\" (a career-establishing hit for Webb in Glen Campbell's 1967 version) and the Burt Bacharach/Hal David classic \\"Walk On By\\" (a huge hit for Dionne Warwick in 1964).  But unlike a lot of the extended psychedelic \\"jams\\" that had infected much of rock and roll during the last few years of the 1960s and had drifted into mind-numbing repetition, Hayes' approach, utilizing recitations, lush string arrangements, and his own great keyboard work, made those songs into something completely different.  This re-mastered version, interestingly, contains the singles' versions of \\"Phoenix\\" and \\"Walk On By\\", which were mild hits on the Billboard Hot 100 in late 1969 (though still unusually long at, respectively, 6:57 and 4:33).    Along with his later soundtrack score to SHAFT in 1971, HOT BUTTERED SOUL defined Isaac Hayes' smooth but straightforward approach to his genre, one that would be emulated (particularly by Barry White), copied, and arguably stolen by many over the ensuing decades, right up until his shockingly untimely demise in August 2008.  For anyone with a taste for R&B, HOT BUTTERED SOUL is unquestionably a masterwork of the highest order.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|This starts with great promise. It has a self-referential start with a narrator (Garry Marshall doing Peter Falk) talking about uncreative beginnings. Then we see the hero's vision of a huge ball rolling through the town destroying everything. It merges with the similar ball in the first Indiana Jones, literally coming through the screen and out the door.  Then it is revealed as a vision. Then there follows notice that a movie is to be made of the stupid chicken. (We see it at the end.)  Disney is desperate to cover the loss of its relationship with Pixar, which singehandedly saved the company. Dreamworks seems incapable of doing something with legs.  But Disney is ever more straightjacketed with formula and moralizing. That's what defines them.  So this movie is yet another disaster. But oh what a great opening.  You know, opening sequences have become something of an obsession in Hollywood. Often, they are financed independently and designed and added after the main film is set. You can see that here: the tone and cleverness of the opening is in a much higher class than the tepid movie.  Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.
B001LMT50W|5.0|Not much else to say but this is excellent and a must have for Coldplay fans, even non-fans should give it a try. There is a lot of music on this album and I can play it over and over...Just an all around awesome album with some new sounds and instruments but same beautiful writing and execution.
B00003CXFV|4.0|I cannot believe the abomination that is Erin Brockovich. This is a $100 million+ grossing wretched trash catered to the audience in the same fashion as Patch Adams. Anybody who loathes the manipulative, vulgar and sentimental Patch Adams will hate Erin Brockovich as well.  Steven Soderbergh directed this saponaceous and sanitized Hollywood version after his botched effort The Limey and he does with his annoying guerilla cinematic gimmicks as usual -- which is also an irritating factor of the film.  What really grates my nerve the most is not only Julia Roberts' bizarre and over-the-top portrayal of the real-life Erin Brockovich whose attitude and lifestyle are rude, irresponsible and repugnant but also the fact Steven Soderbergh and the screenwriter seem to believe this is an important \\"message movie\\". If that's the actual intent of the film, then it fails because it definitely isn't the emotionally intense and sympathetic movie unlike Michael Mann's brilliant film The Insider. It just ends up cumbersome and retch-inducing with the forced \\"stand-up-and-cheer happy ending\\" that borders on utter audience manipulation. These and the steady stream of coarse and vulgar language throughout the movie -- especially in the scenes where Erin cuss at her kids and desecrated over 600 clients with her \\"sexual favor\\" reference intended as a sarcastic joke -- made me despise the movie with vehemence. If this movie was meant to reflect the exhibition of the vulgar attitude by the real-life Erin Brockovich, then I have no respect for her as an intelligible human being whatsoever.  Any movie glorifying the cynical attitude of the characters and screwed-up lifestyles like the ghastly overrated American Beauty do not deserve my respect. This movie is an insult to my perceptive sense of common sense, decency and intelligence.
B000KX0IOA|4.0|The movie \\"Gandhi\\" references a man that became a hero while traveling through South Africa. He was trying to fight against the Indians biased laws they had thus created against the Indian people. It dates back to a time in his life when he was thrown off a South African train for not being willing to give up his first class seats due to being an Indian. In an attempt to change the bias laws against the Indians in South Africa he starts a protest campaign for the rights of all Indians. In doing so he is arrested several times and thrown in jail. The government receives a lot of un-needed and unwanted attention that is brought forth through Gandhi's imprisonments and campaigns. Therefore the government of South Africa finally gives in, even though it did not help the Native Blacks of that country.     Due to the nationwide recognition Gandhi received through this accomplishment, India invites Gandhi back in the attempt to obtain India's independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees to accept the challenge set forth and sets to form what starts out as a non-violent, cooperation campaign. This campaign is set up of millions of Indians nationwide. Violence and again more imprisonment cause trouble. Through the attention that the campaign receives Britain is faced with severe pressure to grant India's independence, which is eventually achieved. However, the victory for independence is shortly set back when tension among the Hindus and Muslims arise nationwide. Violence and fighting erupt in lasting brawls. In the attempt of ceasing the violence, Gandhi goes on a hunger strike and declares he will not eat until the fighting between the religions has stopped. Even though it eventually stops, the nation shows to be split by religion in such a vast range. In trying to bring peace among the religions in his last days, he upsets one of his opponents which ultimately ends at the fate of Gandhi at what the movie shows in the beginning.    Through this story line its veryinteresting how even today within our own world religions we are in similarity still per say those of the descent of Pakistan and that area, are still fighting among themselves due to religion. One side is set in their ways and not willing to conform to the others or to even bother to ponder on the insight the other has to offer. It's something many still strive for today, spiritual independence. Even though free in relation to bondage, many are still not free from the ties of violence and destruction for the sake of their religion and beliefs.
0385504225|1.0|Had such hopes for this book.  Found it totally predicatable and in the end it felt like a huge sell out.  Like DB sold out to all of the critics who reviled his books as a work of the devil and now he was trying to soothe their worries and tap into another market segment.    Additionally, there were MULTIPLE typos and incorrect word usages throughout the book. My 17 year old could have edited this book and done a better job.  Can honestly say, I won't be waiting anxiously for the movie or the next DB book.      Anyone want a slightly used Kindle version of this book?
192076920X|4.0|It's hard to criticise such a compelling book.  As one of the other reviewers said, 900 pages is off-putting - until you read the first one.  It's a terrific story and I'm recommending it to all my friends.    That said, I feel it falls short of great writing because of its poor editing.  There is simply too much of the same stuff over-and-over.  I swear I almost put it down due to the inumerable repetative descriptions of everybody's eye color - including a dancing bear's!    The story itself is compelling, the characters come to life and the city feels real.  It's a great read, no doubt.  Reading Robert's novel, I thought of Hemmingway many times and wished Roberts had had the luck of having such a great editor as he did.
B002NYB712|4.0|Another huge PT fan here, I have been counting the days until this album arrived on my doorstep and I like it. I like it a lot.  It's everything a fan would ask for, like a kitchen sink chock full of PT.  But I can't say that this album grabs me and shakes me and won't let me go like their other albums.  I am listening to it nonstop, and some songs are very good--right now I truly love \\"I Drive the Hearse\\", \\"Black Dahlia\\" and \\"The Incident\\".<br /><br />I don't know if that is because this is not a great PT album, or just that I have become too familiar with their sound.  Maybe I need more time with it, not less--but I have the feeling that more time will just uncover more familiarity and that is possibly what is keeping me from raving about it.<br /><br />ETA: After listening to this album for the past several weeks, I think I understand what the problem is for me.  From the first track all the way until \\"Time Flies\\", I love this album as much as anything else I have heard by PT.  But from \\"Time Flies\\" (which I just don't like, I have tried to no avail) up until the start of \\"I Drive the Hearse\\", which is the last track on Disc 1, I am gone mentally and emotionally, and nothing can keep me there.  Then once \\"I Drive the Hearse \\" starts up, I love this album again all the way through the end of Disc 2.  That's just me, though--other reviewers here love the songs during the stretch that loses me.<br /><br />ETA: I need to stop editing this review, but I have to add one more thing, about PT in general. I am over forty, about to be forty five, in fact.  I live in a suburb, I have two kids, a husband, a mortgage, a cat and a Subaru. In short, I am as far away from young and cool as you can get--I am not even old and cool yet.  And that is fine, but one thing I used to mourn was the fact that I probably would never love a band the way I did the Beatles as a kid, or the Clash in high school, or Nirvana--you know, that electrified connective sense of discovery that you get. At some point for a lot of people, you realize you have crossed over and suddenly there is \\"the kid's music\\" and \\"your music\\", and while you might truly enjoy \\"the kid's\\" music, nothing seems to sound as brain-grabbingly amazing as the music from your youth.  Well, I discovered PT about two years ago, and they brought back that kind of rush about music that I missed.  They really are that good, deep, and enthralling to listen to.lot of people, you realize you have crossed over and suddenly there is \\"the kid's music\\" and \\"your music\\", and while you might truly enjoy \\"the kid's\\" music, nothing seems to sound as brain-grabbingly amazing as the music from your youth.

B001I7YZGY|4.0|I think this book was a tremendous book. The only thing was that it had a little to much describing, but oher than that I that book was one of the best books I've ever read.        It is about a 14 year old boy who name is Alex Rider and he works with the MI16 which is a spy unit, who was wounded by being shot by a sniper in the left shoulder. The bullet was actually aiming for his heart until he stepped off a curb, it was that exact moment that saved his life. He was in the hospital for quite along time, actually o long. So he decided to sneak out and get a breath of fresh air. He was stopped by four men who came in and shot the receptionest in the head because they were looking for the boy in the next room to Alex. He out smarts all of the men even with a wounded arm, until he forgot about the driver who unexpectedly hit him and knocked him unconsious. The men then set him in a building and catch it on fire. You have to find out if he survives by reading the book.

031604461X|3.0|first let me start off by saying that i am a huge fan of stephenie meyer and the twilight saga. i must admit however, i did see the movie twilight way before i ever thought of reading the book and sadly i do regret it because i felt the movie was severely lacking, however, that is a completely different review. The first three books were so good, i couldnt even put them down and way before i finished one, i ran out and bought the next one. wihin a two week span of finishing the first 3 books i began to read breaking dawn. i was excited. Everything was great up until the end of book one. by the time i had gotten to jacobs story, the excitment for me was gone. i just want to know how was it even possible for them to conceive a child at all? then it all got a bit too \\"magicy\\" for me. dont get me wrong, the element of magic has always been around, however it was more realistic the first time around and now it seems a little disney to me. anyway, i sulked my way through the next two books in what seems like a forever amount of time and then it hit me. the disinterest. right around the time of the vision of the volturi's arrival. I wasnt that far from the end but i dreaded finishing the book. by the time i finished my fear was certain. there was no conflict to overcome except the volturi's arrival, they didnt even fight,and what made me really upset was after they left someone said that they havent fought in like 2500 years! so why would they start then? omg! why even build up an anticipation for a big let down? everyone loves a happy ending but i kind of feel dupped of something. i hope there is another novel. i will hope that i read it and regret ever writing this review.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Great movie for young kids.  Seller sent clean, well wrapped DVD.  Would recommend the seller to friends.
0307454541|4.0|I bought this book because it was recommended by a friend.  It's not on my book club and I hadn't heard of it.  When I first started reading it I had a little trouble getting into it, and wondered why my friend assured me I would enjoy it, so I stuck with it and then really got into it.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was one of those books I can't wait to get back to and have a hard time putting down.<br />The few flaws other reviewers have suggested didn't bother me because I knew it had been translated from Swedish into English.  I knew as soon as I got to the end there definitely needed to be a sequel.  Then I learned there is a sequel \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire.\\"  I plan to order that from Amazon and can't wait to read the next one.
0385504225|3.0|As most others have said, the book is really no different than Angels & Demons, or the Davinci Code, it follows the exact same formula.  I couldnt help but think...\\"have I read this before?\\" as the similarities were that close.  Overall, it was an entertaining read, but not what I hoped it would be.  As others have mentioned, I too felt like I was reading a book based on the movie National Treasure at moments.  I also felt like the book built up to a rather disappointing end that just sort of deflates the reader.   I'm sure they're making a movie of this book as well, and I have a feeling that the 3rd time around might be a flop.  Again, you've seen and read this before, Langdon in a race against time decoding symbols on the run, a nutcase who takes things to the extreme, a semi-love interest, a secret society, etc....you've already read this book, just in different settings.

B000H7JCIW|3.0|I love Liza. Was glad to see this one now on DVD. But, it looks like a 1:33 version stretched to widescreen. But, a few adjustments on my TV corrected it and made her look less fat-legged.<br /><br />Halfway through she is on stage with what looks like the dancers from the Radio City Music hall where it was recorded. Aren't they called the Rockettes?<br /><br />Well, that made the show and Liza sings \\"New York, New York,\\" while the other gals do a parody of Liza's songs while Liza looks on in amazement. It is on Amazon and hopefully some of her other concerts will soon be available too. I haven't bought Liza With a Z, yet. I keep forgetting to look for it, knowing it has been issued on DVD.
0385504225|2.0|I liked the DaVinci code, even with it's unrealistic plot line the subject matter was eye opening and interesting.  This book however, the plot is just ridiculous. The characters seem like the same characters from Da Vinci, especially the bad guy. I thought 2 of the major 'twists' in the book were completely predictable. (location of the mysteries and who the bad guy was).   Subject matter was interesting - D.C. Sites, history and Masons. I thought maybe the ending would justify how painful it was to read most of this book but I was very very disappointed with the end.
0385504225|2.0|I was not a big enthusiast of the Code, but at least it was true to its mission.  I was deeply disappointed in the Symbol.  It was a combination of National Treasure and The Celestine Prophecies.  It is a really poor knock-off of existing pop culture. The ending was a real cop-out and I'm afraid that the entire novel is just a huge \\"cash cow\\".  One would think that after seven years, the author could produce something with some integrity and believability.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Well, I finished it but not because I was enjoying it, but because I kept thinking the next chapter would redeem it and I had 'hope' that it couldn't be this bad.  I agree with almost all reviews except the 3+ stars.  It started out entertaining, but started going downhill at about the 6th chapter.  Same words, same plot, same style of 'incredible', 'surprise', dumbfounded, stupid efforts to try to be exciting chapter after chapter and falling short.  Maddening at the attempts and writing. I had the two 'big' surprises or should I say 'secrets' figured out about half way through but couldn't believe that it would be that simplistic, so I kept going.  Yep, it was exactly what I thought. I knew who the evil villain was, and what the secret was that was hidden for centuries.  Not that I don't agree with the last few pages of 'insight' about 'The Word', as I've studied much on New Thought and energy healing, but how it was wovening and explained in the book as this being a brand new idea and a secret that was too dangerous to tell the 'common man' and it was not even explained very well at that.  And the idea that the terrible national security threat was an expose' on the Mansons.  Give me a break!    Don't buy it.  Buy DeVinci Code it was worth the read, but this is not worth the paper used or the film if a movie is stupidly going to be made.   Tom Hanks Don't Do it!
B002DKGWSO|4.0|I don't know how many horror remakes and movies I've seen made in the past 6 or so years but someone needs to tell these people how to make a scary movie. I mean, there's nothing wrong with gritty atmosphere and tension but if you're just trying to pass off gore as \\"this'll make the audience lose sleep at night\\" and call it a day well they're wrong. So looking at the Saw films, Hostel films, remakes of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th or stuff like Black Christmas and My Bloody Valentine 3D are coming by the truckloads to the theatres (and strangely leaving just as quickly), in comes another horror remake with the \\"Last House on the Left\\" and I remember just before putting down the cash to check it out I thought \\"ugh, this better not be the same thing over and over again\\", well surprisingly it wasn't and it was shockingly good. Not in my opinion enough to buy, slight bare-bones release aside, but considering what we normally have to put up with, this is an improvement.<br /><br />The Collingwood family are headed on vacation to their summer home when daughter Mari decides to borrow the car, head into town and visit friend Paige. When a weird kid named Justin says he can get them some good marijuana provided they let him buy cigarettes, Mari reluctantly goes along to Justin's motel room and relax. Only none of them expected to be visited by Justin's dad Krug, girlfriend Sadie and a bit \\"off\\" Francis with Krug having just escaped police custody. Not wanting to let them leave, the whole ordeal will end with Paige dead and Mari raped and supposedly dead too. A violent storm comes in and Krug and company decide to take shelter...at the Collingwood family home and it won't be long until either the Collingwoods or the visitor realizes just who exactly the other party is.<br /><br />This remake does one thing right that most other remakes don't is that it puts on emphasis on the nature and unflinching visuals of the film and not simply relying on gore. Now keep in mind this movie isn't deprived of more violent stuff but this film is relatively tamer to other horror films recently and a lot of simple actions by characters, though like I said tamer than most, are more effective by just how realistic they are. The centerpiece of course, for lack of a better word, is the rape scene which is even more prolonged in the unrated version of the film and its here where the film disturbs with not only what happens to Mari but also to her friend Paige and kudos for the actress Martha MacIsaac from taking the typical \\"best friend who gets offed\\" role and actually making one sad and disturbed to see her go. However the one misstep and it's the one a lot of critics noted is the ending scene which feels and plays out like one of those weird codas where the movie could've ended here and be done only there's this additional scene and you're putting down the remote going \\"oh, there's more?\\" It's the goriest moment in the whole film yet the outlandish act of it kind of ruins it.<br /><br />As far as the roles are concerned, everyone pulls their own weight and this isn't one of those kind of films where one or two characters are above normal while the rest are one-note with each one providing an actual character and the best of these are Garret Dillahunt as Krug, Tony Goldwyn as the dad and Monica Potter as the mom and both of the latter 2 should also get mention since they do enact their revenge and in particularly violent ways yet that whole feeling of \\"my god, look what we're doing\\" never shakes. Dillahunt I guess is so good at being particularly loathesome which'll probably explain why the ending scene was in because as we know we love to see villains get their comeuppance and I'm sure nobody really liked the one they went with.<br /><br />Is it a movie worth buying? Not really considering its barebones features even for a Blu-ray and as a movie it's one of those kind where you'll probably like it but it won't have that lingering effectwhere a month down the line you'll go \\"think I wanna watch that again\\". Then again, better than what's been coming down the pipeline lately.'ll go \\"think I wanna watch that again\\". Then again, better than what's been coming down the pipeline lately.
1448649005|5.0|I had never read this classic until now.  What an amazing book!  This was much more scary and scientific than I had expected.<br /><br />The story did not end like the film, the book continued and explored what the Monster did after Frankenstein tried to kill it, how it learned and began to hunt Victor!<br /><br />That was great!  I like a book that does not end like a Hollywood film, that continues to answer the questions the read would have.<br /><br />Now I know why this was such a best seller, and still is today!  Top Marks!
0385342020|3.0|I have read all of her books and this one definitely did not stand out. It gets a bit tedious at some point and it is not as funny as other books of hers. It is for sure a fun read but if you are a S.K's fan, this might be a let down for you.
0374105235|4.0|My gosh. This book was heavy in emotional content. It leaves you kind of hoping that Ishmael embellished his story beacuse the alternative being that the story is accurate begs the question, what are you doing to make the world a better place?
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|...I respectfully offer one critique for Mr. Brown's \\"The Lost Symbol.\\" The product placement offers provided by iPhone, Blackberry, Escalade and Lexus simply aren't worth the potential harm to your hard-earned reputation as an exquisitely gifted story teller. Go back to your nature. Imagine how different the world would be today if Da Vinci had painted the Mona Lisa  holding a bottle of Coca-Cola. If the offers from those product manufacturers are too good to pass up, write and star in a series of Dan Brown style commercials for them. Otherwise, the book was an intelligent page-turner with a delightfully deranged villain.
0316017922|4.0|Having never read any of his previous works, I found the idea of Outliers interesting. Whilst the message is clear i it takes more than intelligence to succeed, I am not sure what I thought of the stereotypical Chinese student amongst other stereotypes and the biased last chapter which talked about his family. All in all, it was a worthy read.
B000026258|5.0|The World Premiere of this work took place at Town Hall in New York City -- on Saturday, April 24, 1976.  And this is the World Premiere Recording of that epic performance!  This truly being the original recording (I do have a thing about those!), I like this one the very best of all.  Indeed, it was this very recording from which clips were taken, and used in Dr. Carl Sagan's 13-part \\"Cosmos\\" TV Series.  Here is one thing it reminds me of: seeing the landscape of a new world (such as Mars) for the very first time!  I also have a thing about music that was used in that series; TV entertainment that truly comes only \\"once in a blue moon\\".<br /><br />This work was conducted by the composer, by the way -- who opened it from the marimba to set the tempo, so that everyone else could follow and join in at the appropriate times.  Boy, talk about a nearly-impossible work to perform! -- too bad I'm only allowed to give it a paltry five stars!  o:-)
0765350386|4.0|Book one of one of those epic fantasy trilogies; I checked it out because the author is finishing the 'Wheel of Time' in place of the deceased Robert Jordan.  While I wasn't quite expecting the opening chapters' adverb overdose, I got over it quickly and became absorbed in the story.    Allomancy is the magic system.  It involves the internalization and 'burning' of metals, i.e. the magic consumes the metal for an effect.  A 'misting' can use one metal only, and a 'mistborn' can use all metals.  The magic system is well constructed and intricate, and generally elevates the plot.  Both main characters are mistborn.  The references to 'mist' come from an unexplained 'magic' mist that comes at night and shrouds the land.  The mist itself is set up as mysterious and spooky.      The book is about an escaped convict and a guttersnipe girl in an extremely repressive feudal slave society.  The Lord Ruler, a 1000 year old demigod, runs everything, but doesn't get hands-on very often.  He's got evil Inquisitors (full mistborn) and Obligaters (mistings) to do his dirty work, though the nobility does a good enough job breaking their slaves (skaa) that they rarely get involved.  Book one is about rebellion, organized by the main characters, who are involved with the dark side of society.  Half is 'root for these kind-hearted thieves' and a quarter is 'Vin enters society' and a quarter is 'magic combat action.'  It's a nice balance, but not much humor.      My impression after reading the book is that this story is up there with David Farland's 'The Runelords,'  Jim Butcher's 'Furies,' and Raymond Feist's 'Magician Trilogy.'  It's good fantasy.  What kept it off five stars was it took itself too seriously sometimes.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I haven't watched the movies. I got this set as a gift for my dad. I can tell you that I saved $20 by buying it from Amazon.com instead of my local Wal-Mart. The package arrived right when they said it would and Dad loved it.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Awesome! The 3 part symphony at the end is worth the money alone. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. Bravo Muse! I love track 3, sounds a little like Depeche Mode. Love it. They are definately getting more experimental and that's a good thing. I love this band and I'm so glad that they are starting to make an impact here in the US. I get so sick of people saying... \\"Who is Muse?\\" Makes me want to scream.     Buy this CD!

0385504225|2.0|As a thriller the book was moderately entertaining, even though some plot twists are hardly surprising, and the scavenger hunt gets tiresome at times. It is, however, necessary to completely suspend your disbelief.     Nevertheless, I could not really recommend the book to most readers. Having been a defender of the first two Robert Langdon books, I expected this one to treat freemasonry with the same level of suspicion as it did Christianity. I thought, for the sake of a good plot, it is all right to spin a yarn constructing a massive conspiracy theory that casts fairly innocent actions in a dubious light, especially if applied in equal measure to all your subjects. However, the veneration that Langdon (as Dan Brown's voice) shows for freemasonry casts my former perspective into doubt. Even practices that could very easily be portrayed as sinister are defended to such a degree that I fully expected a masonic membership application at the end of the book.      I have to admit that I felt offended at times. The idea of drinking wine from a skull as opposed to a chalice during communion simply is not the same thing, no matter how often Langdon claims it is symbolically identical.     For these reasons, as well as the ludicrous brevity of many chapters and the outdated cliff-hanger style, I cannot award more than two stars.
B002GMNLKQ|5.0|Insomnium was my little secret for a number of years... Not many folks in the metal scene knew them, and whenever I entertained metalheads (who are a very finicky bunch at times), I would always pull them out like a secret weapon and play them for my guests who were always jaw-droppingly amazed that so much talent slipped by them unnoticed. No more. These guys deserve it all, and I couldn't be more pleased to see they're still killing it. Get this and strike a death blow to metal mediocrity!
B001PPGAIA|2.0|This movie had a little toooo much action in it!  A bit long!  Kinda creepy...  Good leading man though...
0953104907|4.0|I have been a professional woodworker for over 30 years, I specialize in finish carpentry and stairs. I have a good knowledge of wood species, tools, jointery and woodworking techniques.  Having said all that I am very glad I purchased this book before I began making my first guitars. Hiscock covers everything from how to design a well balanced, good sounding, strong guitar, all the way through finishing techniques and guitar setup.  The author also covers the three methods of attaching neck to body, how to calculate neck angle, placement of fingerboard, bridge and pickups. The pictures and illustrations are high quality and easy to understand. I am constantly referring back to this book as I am working on my guitars.  My only knock is the section explaining what tools one would need to build a guitar.  To build a guitar with just the tools shown would require a great deal of skill and time.  To make the job a whole lot easier a good quality table saw, jointer, routers, surface planer and spindle sander would be good to have access to.  As a whole I would highly reccommend the book.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|This music is fantastic!  It's very beautiful!  Very emotional!  Every time I listen to, for example: Darcy's letter...  My eyes well-up with tears, and my imagination goes wild!

0316044695|5.0|I meant to write this review a long time ago, but I'm on a roll, so I figured I'd write reviews for all the books I've read, a few at a time.  Luttrell tells a compelling story, one that you won't be able to put down. It starts off with the Navy SEAL training in California and the troubles and training they go through, to become the team that leads up to the \\"incident.\\"  Being a Veteran, I know the trials and tribulations of training and the subsequent war. This said, I however, was never a Navy SEAL or any type of specialty trained warrior. What these men go through, from what I've read and personally heard. It is just as intense if not more, than what Luttrell explains. But this book isn't merely about the training, that is simply the precursor to the big battle.  By the time the book gets to Afghanistan, you're pulled in. The action scenes are intense, it begs to be made into a movie.  Luttrell had to make some tough decisions and he goes into detail the emotions struggle it takes to make the decisions and the after effects that come with those decisions. From trusting his gut, to questioning it, Luttrell, tells it like it is, good or bad.  This is an honest narrative of the realities of war. Luttrell tells it best when he talks about the questions and decisions that are made during war. Decisions in the field are vastly different than the ones politicians and civilians make sitting at home.  This is the BEST book on the Afghanistan side of the war. Hands down!
B00005JO20|1.0|I suggest, you should not show this movie to kids under 13.  Because it is very, very, very horrifying and graphic and demonic and a lot of bad scenes and I think this movie should be rated \\"R\\"!  In the jungle the people's hair is long, and creepy!  I suggest you should not let your under 13 aged children see this! ALERT ALERT!
B002M3SP32|4.0|I would like to start off by saying this book is not 100% accurate by any means.  This is a fictional story, set in a fictional world, about a fictional event.  After reading some other reviewer's articles I get the impression that some thought this was supposed to be a true story using strict facts and real world technologies.  Dan Brown does not include a bibliography and never pretends to be a Computer Science wizard.  With that said, the book is wholely enjoyable with a few interesting plot twists and great pacing.<br /><br />Susan Fletcher, an NSA code breaking prodigy, wakes up to disappointing news.  Her future husband, David  Becker, has been sent over seas to find an item of great importance to the NSA causing them to miss their rendezvous.  Disappointed, she gets called into work.  Something is not right at the NSA.  For the next 24 hours Susan and David run head long into murder, corruption, sorrow, and have to make decisions that will not only affect them but also effect the entire world.<br /><br />Fans of Michael Crichton, Dan Brown's previous work, thrillers, and scifi will enjoy this book.  Anyone that loves a good fiction book should also give it a try.  For people that like to nit pick details and have to have every word footnoted, this is not the book for you.
B0011N1WE8|4.0|I saw this movie 3 times in one month!  I like it sooo much!  Very good picks for actors!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Incredible.  There's a couple of segments of video that are a little drawn out, but that's what fast forward is for.  I love cranking up the surround and watching on my 61\\" with the lights down.  I only own a couple of concert DVD's, this one and Hell Freezes Over and a Metallica I think, but I can't imagine them getting much better than this one.  Feels like I'm at the concert.  Recommend to any Floyd fan.  And if you're not one, this might turn you into one.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I've always liked this movie, it was scary the first time I saw it, but now it's still suspenseful.
0452286751|1.0|Shorter Ayn Rand: A combination of greed and cruelty will get you more power, sex and money than either greed or cruelty alone.    It's a crummy novel, too. When I was in college, long ago, the architecture students used to arrange a showing of the movie version once a year, at which they would jeer and hoot and holler not unlike the way a later generation behaved at 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show.'
0783240236|3.0|The movie is so outdated that it wasn't scary, but some of the scenes were kind of graphic.  It was VERY slow too.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|A hi-def updated version of the Heston/Vincent Price movie, featuring creepy vampire like villains slashing and slaying, filmed with great CGI effects. Robert Nevill (Will Smith) plays a military scientist who is one of the last men on earth, due to his immunity to a deadly virus that has killed almost the entire human population and turned them into killer monsters. What makes this flick so intense and gripping is the producer's genius cinematic technique; almost zero sound at all times, featuring main just one character and his dog, filmed in a desolate NYC turned into a dead zone. The attacks from the goons are fast and furious. Good paced plot development and ending.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|These songs rock!  Very clean!  They seem like Country at times, but are good!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|First off I want to say that this is typical Dan Brown.  If you're a Dan Brown fan then you won't be disappointed. The book was great.  The research and intelligence that went into this novel was superb.  I loved every second of it from start to finish.  I was especially grateful that the e-book was available on the same day that the hard copy was.  Well done to his publishers for doing that.  Well done and bravo to Dan Brown for taking what the Secret did to a whole other level. Great, great job.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is my all-time favorite movie!  I think they should have replaced Matthew MacFayden with James MacAvoy,  but owell.  My friend and I could watch this movie over and over again!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|The first time I watched this with my 3 yr old granddaughter, she seemed to lose interest because of the length.  The next week she wanted to watch again and was mesmerized for the duration.  There are other things on the CD's but I haven't bothered to check them out.  The original movie/music is what I wanted and that is what I got.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|Very sweet movie, you do have to pay attention.  So as to know what is going on...  The ending is very good.  Gives me a nice warm feeling!
B0010X745K|1.0|The dialog is weak, the acting wooden, the plot thin the end predictable. The Mist is a perfect storm of terrible movie making. The only redeeming part, ironically enough, is Toby Jones' performance as a grocery store clerk. My advice is to stay clear of this Stephen King adaptation.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|This could well be Geoffrey Arnold Beck's finest work to date, and it's all done live at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London. If you enjoy solo guitar-playing that is smokin' hot, highly nuanced, and utterly gorgeous then you're going to love this album. It is available as either a CD or DVD, and both will be worthy additions to your collection.<br /><br />On this live date Jeff is backed-up by keyboardist Jason Rebello, drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, and the hot (in more ways than one) young Australian bassist Tal Wilkenfeld, all great players in their own right. On a few tracks in the DVD version Beck is joined by superb guest artists Joss Stone, Imogen Heap, and Eric Clapton.<br /><br />This album is a delicious display of guitar virtuosity ranging from blues to rock to jazz and beyond. This is Jeff Beck at the top of his form, playing with great artistry and pure joy.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this workout as I needed something to motivate me into getting in shape.  I love the fact that there are only 2 people working out besides the instructor...you have two choices, easy or hard..just follow that person.  I was getting tired and Jillian was very motivating and so I kept going.  I had to push myself to finish some of the segments, but in the end it was worth it.  I would highly recommend this workout dvd.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter is the consumate anti-hero, but done in a unique way that make you feel deliciously guilty for rooting for him and his \\"hobby\\".  Very clever rationalization of a character one should despise, but, in reality adores.

B000NXVS96|5.0|I had seen Bridget Jones's Diary the MOVIE and thought it was sort of cute but nothing fabulous. It was by mear happenstance that I stumbled across this book at the library and decided \\"ehh..what the heck?\\" I wasn't expecting to like it much. However, it has to be one of the funniest books I have ever read! Witty and hysterical is how I would describe it. It is, like almost all books, MUCH better then the movie and if I had only known beforehand I would have read it years ago. I often found myself crying from laughing so damn hard and in a sort of funny shock at the things Bridget does and says. I am buying this book for BOTH of my sisters because I need to share the humor!
0061719544|5.0|I've always loved Craig Ferguson as a comedian, but now I have a newfound respect for him as a person. American on Purpose delivers a funny and touching account of his journey from Glasgow to Hollywood. He is honest about about his alcoholism and drug use, his decision to become a US citizen, and everything in between. This is a surprisingly candid and literate memoir, a refreshing change from the usual celebrity tell-all.
B000JLQSWE|5.0|Upon my first few listenings of this remaster, I slowly came to grips with the fact that I never really gave the eighth \\"Project\\" a fair shake despite all the opportunities to do so over the course of twenty some odd years.  By the time it was originally released in the mid-eighties, I had already formed some rather strident views as to what a \\"Project\\" was and was not. To a large extent, I think that's why I have been one of Vulture Culture's greatest detractors, but hearing the album remastered as allowed me to look at it again with a far more objective state of mind.<br /><br />The two biggest hurdles were the absence of Andrew Powell, whose orchestrations would have taken [[ASIN:B001QYHHTG The Same Old Sun]] to a whole new level, and the presence of a concept that, for the most part, did not leave nearly as much to the imagination as the previous triumphs [[ASIN:B000A2GJVW I Robot]], [[ASIN:B000IOM1YG Pyramid]], [[ASIN:B000IOM1Z0 The Turn of a Friendly Card]], and, even, [[ASIN:B000NJVWU0 Eve]] did.  This was, perhaps, the first (and only) time Eric Woolfson may have painted with too broad a brush.<br /><br />I think the main problem with the concept behind Vulture Culture is that it applies aggression and opportunism interchangeably in spite of the fact that the two are very distinct from the other.  Vultures, themselves, are rather more opportunistic than aggressive, but Vulture Culture seems to use them to symbolize the economic aggression of the West.  And, yet, the greatest economic disparities in our world are not between East and West nearly as much as they are between the northern and southern hemispheres.<br /><br />But all that said, some very, very good music abounds throughout this album.  And thanks to Sony's Direct Stream Digital Sampling from the best source tapes available, [[ASIN:B001QYHHNC Let's Talk About Me]], [[ASIN:B001QYEBQ8 Separate Lives]], and [[ASIN:B001QYGF26 Days Are Numbers (The Traveller)]] have never sounded better!  But it is the bonus material on this remaster that I found most compelling.  How a gemstone like [[ASIN:B001QYEBVI No Answers Only Questions (Final Version)]] could slip through the cracks and not see the light of day for twenty-three years is completely beyond my comprehension.  A folk song of that caliber would have really made me look at the original album in a very different way!  Add to that the fact that the best of the three instrumental reinterpretations of the entire albums appears here with [[ASIN:B001QYKXKG The Naked Vulture (Early Mixes)]].  Laden throughout these early mixes is the very witty banter of Lee Abrams that previously only appeared in a heavily edited form on \\"Let's Talk About Me\\" back in 1984.<br /><br />While I would never have given this album the high marks I have here in its original form, this remaster deserves every bit of praise.  Not only is there a drastic improvement in the sound quality with this remaster, the bonus material really is something very special.  Of all The Project remasters, only the bonus material from Eye In The Sky rivals that which is here.  I suppose I will always have some of the same problems with a few of the songs for their over-reliance on pop music convention, but this remaster is an entirely different experience altogether.remaster that I found most compelling.

0312370849|4.0|I never knew about the round up of Jews living in Paris in 1942 and this story needs to be read by more people, so they too hear the story of that dreadful time, and so we do not forget.         It is a moving story of Sarah and her love for her brother. Whilst the characters are fictional, the events are not.  In the book, every second chapter, there is the intertwined story of a journalist investigating Sarah's story, and whilst interesting, it is not as compelling as Sarah's story, and I found myself eagerly awaiting the chapters that were set in 1942.  I think I would have enjoyed the book even more, if the book was solely about Sarah and her life.    Definitely worth your time to read though.

B000QCUB8I|5.0|I can't deny not being impressed by the majority of the tracks on this album.  I'm extremely purist when it comes to most dance music but Justice managed to wow me.  While they're clearly heavily influenced by their fellow Frenchmen Daft Punk it doesn't prohibit them from creating their own unique sound.  Their tracks are layered with funky beats and are guaranteed to get househeads on the dance floor.  Here are my track ratings;<br /><br />1. Genesis  10/10<br />2. Let There Be Light (album version) 10/10<br />3. D.A.N.C.E. [Album Version]  5/10<br />4. Newjack  10/10<br />5. Phantom  10/10<br />6. Phantom pt. II  10/10<br />7. Valentine  5/10<br />8.

One Minute To Midnight  10/10<br /><br />This album by \\"the other\\" French dance duo is not to be missed.  While not as ground breaking as most of Daft Punk's work it's definitely respectable in its own right.  Give it a listen and hopefully you'll be as impressed as I was.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|This a very bad effort by Dan Brown do not waste your money on book.  Its about 400 pages too long and the other 200 pages are not worth reading.

B00006F7S4|4.0|I have almost all Beck's works and this is the best together with \\"mutations\\". I prefer Beck when he does not exaggerate with his usual \\"kind-mix mood\\". Sometimes this feature leads to ingenious and pleasant songs, specially in albums like Mellow Gold or Odelay. But the risk to make mess songs is not do far...Sea Change is completely different: unplugged and orchestrated, he could sound monochord at first, but it grows constantly with listenings for the strenght of each song!

0679735909|4.0|Having been a fairly devoted Byatt fan since \\"Angels & Insects\\" I felt some hesitation about reading this one, based upon the unanimously rapturous reviews from friend and colleague alike.  Fortunately I was able to brush aside any preconceptions (for the most part) and focus on the sheer beauty of the writing found on each page of this fine novel.  The fractured narrative left me less than wholly satisfied, but after getting such pleasure from the workings of language that almost seems like a quibble.  Perhaps not a full-blown masterpiece, but still more than worthy of note.
0307269981|4.0|Short and sweet, this book is good, not great, the first book was far better and more interesting, this one seemed to drag along until the end, but it is still more fun to read than anything put out by James Patterson.
006135323X|5.0|I've found it hard to put this book down since I started reading it. It's a fascinating insight into human behaviour, presented in a clear, non-academic fashion.
0385504225|2.0|I like all the previous Brown's novels and I like a lot the DaVinci code. The Lost Symbol was very dissapointing. The references to the Masons were not sharp and it seems that Langdon spend all book trying to be sure Masons are not upset for the content of the book. Maybe Brown doesn't want the same level of controversy that he got from the Opus Dhei with the Davinci Code. Anyway, the plot is flat and there is a lot of deja vu, the movie National Treasure about thte same topic was more entertaining (and it's not a very good film). I'm happy ot get the kindle version of $9, I'll be mad if I would spend $20 on this.
0679731725|5.0|\\"The Remains of the Day\\" is an incredibly moving book about Stevens, a conscientious and dedicated butler who lives to work and works to live for his employer, Lord Darlington, at Darlington Hall in postwar England. After decades of hustle-and-bustle service at this residence and Lord Darlington's eventual death, Stevens suddenly finds himself under the employ of a new well-to-do resident of Darlington Hall, an American named Mr. Farraday, who recommends his butler take a well-deserved break and \\"motor\\" across the English countryside. After much deliberating, Stevens agrees to do this, and the story is about his acutely sad, monumental, troubling and sometimes crowning moments during the Darlington Hall \\"glory years,\\" when important world leaders visited on a regular basis.<br /><br />Stevens runs the massive household in a professional but polite manner, as all good butlers were expected to do during that time period. His nuanced narration as he reveals his past and present world is ornate and verbose -- yet engrossing -- while his manners are impeccable 24 hours a day, no matter who he comes across. Many people who don't know what Stevens' line of work is mistake him for a distinguished, rich gentleman, a label he is in no hurry to correct. In addition, the prideful butler has no sense of humor and sadly never learned to \\"banter\\" with people, even those close to him. This makes for some heartbreaking moments. Whether he makes a cringe-inducing joke among strangers at a cozy inn, attempts to reach out to his equally hardworking and chilly father or incrementally chooses to forgo the opportunity for true love with his close colleague Miss Kenton, Stevens is that rare person who sacrifices most of life's joys for his job.<br /><br />In choosing to serve the master of the household in the only way he knows how -- by committing 100 percent of himself and his energies to Lord Darlington and Darlington Hall -- it could be argued that Stevens, who does what he does in the name of \\"dignity,\\" missed out on a fuller life of human warmth. As he classily waited on world-renowned political leaders hand and foot at crucial Darlington Hall meetings, Stevens' defense of living such a life was that he played a small role in influencing the outcome of future world events.<br /><br />And in a world where shades of gray rule supreme, one could easily make various cases that Stevens' choice to unfailingly serve Lord Darlington during the prime of both of their lives was admirable, tragic or a mixture of both. As the story concludes, Stevens drops his ever-present stoic persona and honestly opens up, even bravely admitting regrets. Thankfully, even at an advanced age, he learns a great lesson: It's never too late to learn how to banter, and to enjoy what's left of your life -- the remains of the day.gnity,\\" missed out on a fuller life of human warmth.

1563894696|4.0|Batman: The Long Halloween is sort of a sequel to Batman: Year One by Frank Miller. It takes place not too long after that story ended. This graphic novel focuses more on Batman's battle with the mob than it does with other super-villains (though pretty much every super villain is in it... But more on that later). There is a killer dubbed the Holiday Killer who kills someone related to the mob boss every holiday. Not only does the Holiday Killer attract a team of Batman, Jim Gordon, and Harvey Dent, but also gets a big attention from the mob.    This story is definitely a page-turner and a very good Batman tale. The biggest problem I have with is is fairly congruent with most 2-3 star reviews. There is a point where there is just about every super villain (including The Penguin, who has no other place in the story) vs. Batman. Batman then takes them all out in less than 3 pages. Mr. Loeb could have subtracted 3 or 4 of these villains and maybe it would have made more sense. The other problem I have with this story is the ending. There are about 3 twists in the last 10 pages that are unnecessary.    For every con with this book there are many more pros. As stated earlier, the book maintains a very good level of suspense. Another huge pro in this book is Catwoman. Her portrayal here is one of the best I've read. Another excellent thig about this book is the relationship between Batman, Jim Gordon, and Harvey Dent. All in all I would rate this book at 3.5 stars. Some things could have been worked better in my opinion, but the majority of the book works well on many levels. Do yourself a favor and buy it on Amazon as the $13.59 price is going to be much less expensive than anywhere else.
075640407X|2.0|The story itself is entertaining enough; however, the author clearly lacks real experience as a writer.  Although it contains a few gems, overall the structure of the book is definitely lacking.    The main character is the only one developed to any degree over the course of 700+ pages, and cliched characters abound.  Read it if your a big fan of fantasy, but don't expect anything approaching the hype surrounding this book.
B0028K3192|5.0|Well, for one thing, this album is the first of a proposed trilogy of albums, hence the short length.  Second, why do people expect an artist to give you more of the same thing they've been giving you.  I like the fact that Maxwell has grown artistically and is attempting to give me something else than a retread of his previous brilliant work.  I like this album a lot...the brevity is a welcome change of pace from CDs with 20 plus tracks, most of which are filler.  Plus, after reading these reviews, I feel there is a definite lack of analysis here...the song \\"Stop the World\\" is a gorgeous and heartfelt composition.  I say give these songs another spin and to Maxwell, I say, \\"Brother, keep up the good work.\\"
0385341008|5.0|I ordered this on the recommendation of Amazon and because I loved the<br />title..and I adore anything British...<br />Well .... eveyone that is able to read and is on a birthday list or<br />Christmas list might just get a copy of this from me this year..<br />I gave it to a friend of mine and I told her if she didn't laugh<br />out loud, and cry like a baby when she read this I would never but<br />never recommend another book to her...and I say the same to you.<br />These people will become like real friends to you...you will want<br />to get on the next flight out to visit...<br />I just hope you all enjoy it as much as I...
B000NIVJHM|5.0|The recent decease of this singular star made me rethink about a missed quality in most of actors: the naturalness. In this sense I would have to cite three names of different generations: John Cussack, Robert Mitchum and Montgomery Clift.The charisma he breathed plus his abilities as dancer and that gentle charm became him a true icon since the eighties and nineties.<br /><br />Dirty dancing's plot has been retold many times before. But the visible sensuality produced by this movie and the return to the Disco thanks to film such as  \\"Saturday night fever\\", \\"Grease\\", Footlose\\" and \\"Flash dance\\", launched it to the immortality.<br /><br />If heaven exists, I guess God must have said him: WELCOME AT LAST.<br /><br />In memoriam!
0743517849|4.0|I have been listening to the version on CDs.  I have found it quite interesting and I recommend it.  The only drawback is that it seems a bit repetitious in some places--making the same points over again--but you can learn much from others mistakes if you take the recommendations to heart.  Too many of us squander our resources just to impress others (or ourselves).  If you are married, it is important to get your spouse to hear (or read) this book, as you must both be \\"on the same page\\" to make the principles it presents work.
0312330529|2.0|This book IS an absorbing read.      Its weaknesses show up in attentive reading.  The first section, Lin discovering Bombay, making heart connections, is excellent.  The love story is sketchy at best.. twice at least he gets very close to his love ideal, and 'has to leave' on extremely thin premises.  The rise in the crime ranks, and his time in jail, is the least interesting, at least to me.  The final section, beginning with the Afghanistan excursion, is a fast and easy, if unreflective, read.    This book should have been a trilogy.  Part 1, learning Bombay.  Part 2, Rising In Crime.  Part 3, Afghanistan and After.    But the weakness is the author's love for what I can only term Violence Porn.  Lacking even one convincing love scene, we get literally dozens of incidents of graphic violence.. beatings, stabbings, shootings, more beatings, betrayals, on and on.  He is very determined to paint himself as a tough guy with a heart of gold, always being broken.  It's a thin characterization which lowers this book from literature to the level of a genre novel.    Speaking of genre novels and hard-boiled writing, Mickey Spillane and his fictional hard-as-nails detective Mike Hammer did this far better, long ago.
B000KJU1MS|5.0|CRAZY..  I wanna rock n roll all night - and party every day!  This video boggles the mind brings back some seriously old memories - not necessarily of having seen Kiss as a kid, cause I never did.  But magazine shots and a glimpse or two on TV before my mom turned it off (we were 6, and totally into it!) were enough to permanently etch KISS into the collage of mental impressions that I now call \\"the 70s\\".  And while we used to pretend to be the guys in KISS in the same way we played 'Star Wars', I never went through school as a Kiss fan.  Granted, by the time we were starting to really get into music in the early 80s, Kiss was no longer a phenomenon. But they were always there, lurking in the subconscious, whether you knew their music or not!     I just picked up this video then, to revisit a time in my life that would have put me in first or second grade - when these guys were doing this.  What an era we lived in!  These guys were outrageous.  This DVD gives you a pretty good time window that shows Kiss evolving in the mid-70s with talk shows or visits to high schools in between stadium shows.  They created a pretty good rapport with the audience during the shows, definitely what you could call a party band.  Their gimmick needs no explanation although it's fun to analyze KISS.  You had Gene Simmons dripping blood, spitting fire and making lewd gestures with his tongue (even when he's on the Mike Douglas Show in '74 - unbeleivable - totally un-PC but back in those days rock n rollers took themselves a little more seriously).  OK, that's the freak side of the show.  Smokin Ace Freley in his spaceman get-up is a classic 70s image, right along with charazmatic Cat-man Peter Chris.  Paul Stanley, the front man if there is one, kind of balances out Gene Simmons on the left there, and while he is an energetic head-banging 70s rock n roller, you can kinda feel that he cares about the audience.  In between inciting the kids to acheive ever new levels of inebriation, he'stelling the guy in the front row to settle down \\"It's a party, not a road war\\", and \\"KISS loves you\\" -- When asked by a reporter on their British tour in '76,  \\"What is most important to you - the spectacle or the music?\\"    The answer: \\"The audience.\\"     Other gems:     \\"What do you represent?\\"    \\"Destruction.\\"    \\"Destruction?\\"     \\"Yeah, rock n roll - good stuff. Power, energy.\\"    It's fun to see after all these years just how much energy these guys had and what a stage show they could put on.  In the dictionary under 'rock show' it says in parenthesis (see also: KISS) - kidding. But seriously, seeing these shows is witnessing a chapter in rock history like no other.  The band complimented and reflected an era that many lived though.
