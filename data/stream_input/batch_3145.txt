B007IXWKUK|4.0|I love it. I hate it. Had everything you want from a romance novel.  I can't wait to read the third.
B00902AKK4|5.0|Fun little game, quite addictive. No in-app purchases which is a nice change to most games. Easy controls so even my 5 year old can play. Glad I got it as app of the day, but I'd pay $0.99 for it. Well worth it.
161218412X|5.0|I received the collection today and i can say i'm amazed by the build quality of the box and the book. Its a total of about 2k pages separated into 4 books. They are directly taken from Arthur Conan Doyle's texts (unabridged) so this is really complete. In canada this collection is 20$ more expensive but its still worth it, this should be worth around 200$ honestly, a must buy for any Holmes fan.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! The higher the level the harder the game gets. It will make you want to buy the boosters but you will eventually beat said level!
B000P0J0D8|5.0|a true modern American classic of cinema.  A road movie that resembles &#34;Bonnie and Clyde&#34; somewhat, with an all start supporting cast.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This is one of the most interesting &amp; enjoyable games... It will keep you interested &amp; busy for along time.  Loved the fact if you get stumped you have hints to refer to. It also keeps notes for you so you don't have to have pencil &amp; paper to write down codes that you may need through out the game... Would definitely recommend this game!!!! Would of gave it more than a five star if it had been possible.  Just hope they build up some more for this game.  You'll see why at the end of this game... Loved this game &amp; I only hope they keep making this sort of games!!!!! Thank You so much for all the hours of fun!!!!!!
B00G9U7R2O|4.0|Cute movie... The streaming sound kept cutting out. That was frustrating.would love to see again without technical difficulties or interruptions.
B003B02O7I|5.0|Excellent read.  Unexpected but good ending.  One of John Grishman' s real strengths is his attention to detail,  surpassed only by his story telling ability.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The Good Wife continues to be on a par with the best-ever television shows. The story is continually interesting and the characters change to meet the times. Alicia has become a strong and assertive woman. It is one of the more outstanding shows on tv.
B00181JGI2|1.0|I  was  unable  to  watch  this  movie  all  the  way  through.  One  of  the  few  I  shut-off  before  it  finished.  Plot  screwy. Dialogue  makes  no  sense.  Gratuitous  and  excessive  use  of  the F  word,  simply  sprinkled  throughout  the  dialogue.  I  understand  why  this  movie  was  an  &#34;unknown&#34;.  Don't  waste  your  time on  it.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|I haven't been this frightened by a horror/terror film in some time.  This one definitely gave me chills in the theater, and at home on the small screen.
0321811984|3.0|The book was mediocre to me. Although I really liked some of the discussions such as powerful pictures speak volumes, avoid a surplus of text in your presentation, and being present in the moment, I felt like this book was very redundant and a bit over kill. The book stresses the point of simplifying things and not making them lengthy, however it's some what a contradiction of itself. Book has valid points, but a surplus of unnecessary text. ~Chelicia H.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Wonderful songs and style!!!  Big band sound on some old favorites!! Welcome addition to my collection and great to share with friends.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I found Allegiant to be poorly written compared to the first two. Weak plot development. I was very disappointed because I LOVED the first two books and thought they were very well done.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addicting, but so are most games like this. I'm sure I will be bored with it in a week or so.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Just wonderful, this is a compilation of her works online, which are always fun to re-read, and new stories, which had my face hurting from laughing.  Allie never dissapoints!
B00F031WB8|5.0|A very good long hard look at the mind and life of a genius trapped amongst control freaks.  My gosh...if Jimi had lived longer, imagine what he would have been capable.  I am thankful for this legacy that is probably the best documentary piece on him ever filmed.  Great interviewing, and some great interviews with former band mates, producers, and also friends.
1451666179|5.0|Allie at her best - this book is a great look at not only Allie's personal memories, but patterns of behavior that I'm pretty sure we ALL have and those &#34;flawed coping mechanisms&#34; that everyone uses.<br /><br />Just buy it.  Buy it for everyone.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Reinvention of a Classic with today's hottest effects and Director Zach Snyder,  Cavill shines as Kal Ell / Clark Kent with supporting cast Michael Shannon as Zod, Amy Adams as the feisty reporter Lois Lane, Russell Crowe as Jor El with Diane Lane & Kevin Costner<br />playing more modern Maw & Paw Kent.  Well told story with more Kryptonian backstory accompanied by more updated version that works for today's audience.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Everyone in my family loves this movie.  I'm not a huge John C. Reilly fan, but as just a voice, he was pretty good!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I'm simply very romantic for the ending...I know life is not fair, and I know this is what truly happens; but that's why I  choose to read fantasy, romance and fiction; I just can't stand these kind of ending.<br />Love the story, but hate the ending.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Wow, just wow....this is such a fantastic collection. Comes with excellent book art, and of course the history that is metal gear. Snake Eater is still my favorite but they are all great, suggested you play them in ordered to understand the story line if you have never played before
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|OK, folks, those of you not on the wagon train (or for that matter, the locomotive) is ready to leave the station, and ready to rock your socks off.  There is not ONE filler song in this album.  There are plenty of catchy hooks on this album by the riffmeister Tony Iommi, and Geezer's bass is solid as it ever was.  With that being said, do not scoff or think that an album without Bill Ward is necessarily bad or could not be done.  The drumming on this may not be the same style as Bill's, but nevertheless, it's a gallant effort, and kudos to Brad Wilk for stepping up and making this possible.  To think--this is the first \\"classic lineup\\" album in 35 years, minus Bill.<br /><br />Well, enough about that--I do not know what 13 stands for here--perhaps it is the perception that 13 is a superstitious number, or that in some cultures, 13 is considered good luck.  Or perhaps it's the 13th Album in their catalog? I lost count--there's GOT to be more than 13 in Sabbath's deep discography.  Perhaps this is the 13th for the classic lineup (with or without Bill).<br /><br />Only one caveat: Ozzy sounds like he is mouthing every work for word on the opening song from a teleprompter. It's almost as if Forrest Gump is singing the first song.  Other than that, I have no complaints about the rest of the album.  From to opening sludging riffs, of End of the Beginning to the end of Pariah, there is lots of time changes, heavy riffs, good decent phrasing done by Ozzy.  I must say that I am impressed with Ozzy's performance here, as he really cannot go back in time and go back to a wider range when he was younger.  Standout tracks: God is Dead? that solo after 6 minutes and change will have you air guitaring once again like you are in the mid-1970s! yup, the band can still bring a feverish pitch of a jam when they have to.  The way they sound here, they are far from done.  I'd have to say \\"Loner\\" is a surprisingly decent track, if a bit on the negative side.  Zeitgeist is quite reminiscient of \\"Planet Caravan\\" with its acoustic overtones.  Age of Reason is a keeper, by all means.  If you did not get the deluxe edition of this album, you should.  The last three songs are solid, and better in my opinion, than the previous eight tracks.  Methademic is great, and Pariah is a great closing number.<br /><br />Now that they've been through one US tour and parts of Europe and England,  we shall hope to see the Sabs light it up with some more from this new, live-worthy album.<br /><br />Recommended for all rock fans.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I am usually very pleased with Google products, so when I heard of Chromecast I ordered two right away.  However, the Chromecast has been consistently disappointing.  I was very surprised at how little functionality is provided by this device.  It only works with a few sources, and even then, every three or four minutes it disconnects itself.  Often it must be unplugged or rebooted just to make it connect again.    It performed so unreliably that we disconnected it.  I am accustomed to receiving much better value from Google products.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is amazing. I love how customizable it is, when it comes to choosing the different sound options to create the perfect combination.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I started reading Preston & Child in the middle of this series. I was so taken by the Pendergast character that I went back to the beginning and and followed it through quite happily.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|There's about 5 songs on here I LOVE. Venus, Sexx Dreams, Do What U want, Artpop, and Gypsy.  I keep going back to those, they r addicting.  Donatella is pretty good as well.  Lady Gaga is still the most creative artist out there, I love her style and I love the art on art pop, the cover and the pix.  I love that purple crystal ball, it reminds me of a favourite marble I had when I was a kid.  As 4 the haters, if your tiof Lady gaga and u don't like this cd, stop listening to her or find some1 else u like.  i think alot of peepz don't have a mind of their own, if they hear some people say they don't like the cd, they jump on the wagon and get influenced.  This cd is tha bomb jus like her other ones!!!!!
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|A solid, enjoyable action flick. Kind of like &#34;Real Steel&#34; except really huge. Storyline a sort of sci-fi/comic book blend.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love all the Jane Austen novels and I love the various movie versions of them.  This one is by far the best version of Persuasion.  It's true to the book and the tension between the two main characters is built up so beautifully.  The pacing throughout is excellent and the acting is superb.  The scenery and soundtrack are so beautiful and atmospheric!  I highly recommend this to any Jane Austen fan!
B000FBJHT4|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Is it all true? I would lean toward yes. What is your opinion? Great fiction or well-written truth ?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it! It's a great app! Really good for kids and adults alike!  It's like Temple Run, but I love it!
B004TACMZ8|1.0|I was so terribly disappointed in this &#34;multi-scanner&#34;. I understand that it might be a little more difficult to read a lath and plaster wall but this thing was just such a chore to use. It did identify an electrical wire somewhere in the wall…or more like EVERYWHERE in the wall. I just want to know where the middle of a STUD is. I'm trying to hang a TV on the wall and I want a STUD. It took me about 5 minutes to find 2 studs with a rare earth magnet I had and averaged the locations of the nail heads. I couldn't really say with any amount of certainty where anything in the wall was using the Bosch scanner for an hour or more. It couldn't reliably detect anything in the same location more than once and I tried electric, plumbing and wood.<br /><br />Also, the stupid 3 footed (unstable) base will SCRATCH your walls! I just resurfaced and painted the walls with a nice flat paint color and this thing put scratches all over it! About the only redeeming quality was that it has an ON/OFF button. The other reviews were right, I should have listened.
0385121679|5.0|I believe this is the best Stephen King book ever.  I'd actually read it years before, in paperback, and wanted to own the hardcover.  Some of the scenes have stuck in my head since way back when I first read The Shining, especially the bathroom scene when Jack goes in to investigate that tub.  You know the scene.  Creepy as hell!  Hearing that shower curtain clank when Jack knew he'd not drawn it back across the tub.  Seeing that doorknob twisting as someone or something tried to get out.  Creepy!<br /><br />The Shining kept me on the edge of my seat.  It is one of those few books that I just could not put down.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I think it's so cool I will play it my whole life . If you're reading this l hope you  buy the game because it would be more than $0.99 if I priced it it would be more than that.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  The fairytale story is cute and you don't easily get bored because there is so much to do.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The book kept my interest from beginning to end.  Probably the best Grisham book yet.  This would make a good movie.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|it sucked beacause it would not go off I was late for school 3 times because of this stupid thing
B0064X7FVE|5.0|reat app, highly recommend it.  I don't get just my weather but friends and family all over the States.  It's a keeper!
B001QWEE4E|5.0|This is an extremely touching movie and I wasn't really expecting that.  I didn't see this as &#34;that gay cowboy movie&#34; that I'd heard it was, but rather a love story that endured for years.<br /><br />The theme music is beautiful and haunting.  The characters are believable.  I was moved to tears more than once.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love games like this, it gives me about to do during my lunch break and days off, I love it!
0399226907|5.0|A little small but I love this book and it is great quality. I loved it growing up and so will my daughter!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|One of the most important movies produced...to remind us that hatred an bigotry existed then and now. One cannot see this movie without thinking, what am I doing to speak up about prejudice, stereotyping and bullying.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this often.  It's quite and gradually gets louder and louder.  Work great on my Kindle!  It's a keeper!
B00AAQ7JNA|4.0|The concert is great... The footage has a nice quality, but the 5.1 sound is very low.....A bluray disc have to be a very nice sound.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I like it gives me more options and is easier to use. Would suggest that if you are comfortable with a computer this is great for you.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome read. Counldnt put the book down. I must read for any sci-fi nerd like me! Also it's a nice self contained book so if you didn't want to read the next ones you would be content with just this one!1
B00CEB5QU2|3.0|It is ok for files and photos. Could not get it to stream movies. Tried MP4, AVI and MKV formats, all did not work. Does connect to external HDD, leaving it connected to power, otherwise the red battery comes on. After each try to stream a movie, units blocks and requires power  off and restart cycle.<br />25.11.2013 update: problem seems to be when using external HDD only. Tried different movie formats on USB stick and all working fine, even a more than 2GB mkv movie.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|It's a great app but doesn't have chat.  I don't know if it's the app or my kindle!  Something to work on!
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|The series keeps getting better and better.  More background information concerning how Starfleet works.  I like the loose tie-in with DS9
B003Y5H54W|5.0|Was told this was like twilight..... Well its really not.. Actors are better and its addictive lol kind of lovey but good as a whole. Proud to have it!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game will challenge and keep you entertained for hours!  Good for all kinds of travel - plane, car, boat and train, and if only taking a short break.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Every female over the age of  about 15 should be obliged to read this. Apart from being  extremely funny, it tells all you need to know about....well about being a woman of course!
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's a nice diversion from mahjong.  Fun to tackle when I need a change from mahjong.  Works nice on the Kindle!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|guestion  how is this fun i hate it and it is just playing with cand that makes u hungery for some candy
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|I bought this blindly ...hadn't seen it yet... Its awesome. Is a must for any horror movie lover/collector for sure
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Very good read.  I believe this will be my favorite Pendergast novel.  At least, until the writers come out with a new book.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|this is a great game, it has cool graphics and it is amazing for hunters. it does have a few problems though. it is horrible for kindle fire. it freezes it constantly, and when a kindle freezes it stays frozen until you fix it. it also takes up a lot of space, and it takes forever to download and to load all together. I hope this helped
B005HSL626|5.0|this game has taken over my granddaughter so giving thumbs up to these game great for us while traveling ++++
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Classic King!! After reading the first page I was hook line and sinker gone!!! I did not put it down-I ate, went potty, etc with my I Pad in hand.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Unbelievable suffering, worry, and sometimes raw truth depicted in this true story of survival, both physically and emotionally. Beautifully done.
B00164KYV4|5.0|Love this dvd, official copy, no complaints. Great quality, no skipping or freezing. Authentic movie rift right out the plastic
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Reminded me of M.I.B. but less funny.  My 11 year old liked it.  I wouldn't hit rewind to watch it again.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|You need to be able to plan ahead and be able execute your plan. Very thought provoking game. Fun to make it happen.
B00340ESIS|5.0|This is the first screenwriting book I read since Syd Field's and wow, you will never look at movies the same way. And that's a good thing. I knew about the 3 act structure but the 15 beats and 40 scene story board is just amazing. And it's a fun entertaining book, can't recommend this enough.
B00EVW013E|1.0|The problem with the copy here is the Digital Download doesn't have an iTunes code, but instead has a the stuff for the Sony store and Flixster. While the discs are multi-region, the digital download is US only and only in their proprietary non-iTunes store.
B00E8S2JZ4|2.0|I purchased the extended edition expecting the same \\"expansion\\" as LOTR extended editions.  Made the purchase, opened the blu ray only to find this wonderful edition extended by 13 min.  THIRTEEN MIN.  I blew another $20 for 13  min.  Didn't occur to me to LOOK at what I was buying.  It never occurred to me WB wouldn't give this film the same treatment as LOTR.<br /><br />I am so disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its a great game that is challenging and fun. It require the brain and.skill and has competition. It also has an addition of daily challenges that make a good bag of fun. Overall it is about a four and it pretty cool. Go subway sufers
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great twists throughout and I especially loved the \\"what could have been section\\" which tied up most loose ends nicely.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|This is just a retooling of the many &#34;Law of Attraction&#34; and &#34;Thank the Universe&#34;, etc. self-help books flooding the market recently. In my case, some of it worked, some not; maybe the Universe was not very happy with me on these latter days. However, unless you are a real skeptic, it is uplifting in parts, witty and no harm is done by following the simple instructions. Altogether, one finishes the book more optimistic about life itself and less prone to criticizing others.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|I usually enjoy Mr. Eggers' work but this book was not his best.  I didn't care for any of the characters.  His narrative was long winded and didn't progress at all.  The ending was anti-climatic.  This piece would have been better off as a short story.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I didn't know app games could be like this. It's incredible! The graphics, the storytelling, the mini games are all week done and definitely succeeded in giving me the creeps (in a good way). I definitely recommend this.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story was very difficult to follow.  Too many subplots and switching among them without a clear definition. Would not recommend this book.
B0070Z4M4I|5.0|fVery exciting  monster effects and action packed. This is rare remake of an already great 50s classic. Alien Sci Fi at its best.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love this version!  Same graphics &amp; characters.  Good quest lengths so far. Beautiful tools y &amp; very addicting.  Easy in &amp; out of gameplay.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A wonderful, thrilling and facinating story of love and war -<br />I can't wait for the next book to be published!
B001I45UFC|5.0|Great to Revisit an &#34;assignment&#34; novel from school days. Images still vital.<br />Fun still enjoyed while experienced through the characters. Not unlike some of today. Imagining is much more satisfying than having it shown to you.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Should have stopped at 2. No reason to see the movie now. I think the author must have just gotten board. and decided to do something else, anything would have been better. I like the faction system and you could have had anything outside the city but just normal America very disappointing. Anyways enough with my thoughts on this it's just a sad end to a promising opening.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I will play this game for ever and ever!<br />It is so fun.It is the best best best game in the world!
B002KJX4IE|4.0|Premise is stilly, but if you check your brain at the door and watch with an open mind, it's funny.  I particularly like the characters and love the music.  (My wife hates it, and it's definitely not a &#34;chick flick.&#34;)
B00D555BBU|3.0|Needs manual on how to setup just about everything, claims to do alot but can't intuitively find menues or options accomplish the tasks.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Second of the trilogy...keeps you going...wondering what 3 will bring...Makes one think about the influences and circumstances of growing up the dictate choices and drive.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I want to not like this series because it seems so dark of a concept.  But the more you read, the more you want to read.  This second book was an excellent continuation of the first, and a tantalizing tease for the third.  Looking forward to reading the next book.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I was looking for a fresh treatment of the traditional Christmas classics, and Susan Boyle provides it with this album.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|good movie something different ,had sort of that men in black style of action,worth watching good action stunts and comedy as well
B00F91RYL8|4.0|As usual, Brad Pitt is great and his character is believable. I enjoyed it; still have to watch the last 30 minutes of it because I started watching it late and got too sleepy to finish. There was a little bit of swearing language but overall, a great flick.
B000V9D5LG|5.0|Light for its class, Image stabilization which normally raises many lens prices up by 120-300, the very low distortion, and sharpness for this price range is wonderful. IF you aren't bothered by the plastic construction and the sharpness falling off at the 250mm range, you will love this lens. However for expectations for a sub 300 dollar lens, this lens will mostly like soar past your expectations.<br /><br />I recommend even though it has IS, a tripod because lets face it, who doesn't find themselves wanting a tripod with a telephoto lens. Unless your hands belong to RoboCOP, you soon find that without zooming out at a low shutter around say 1/5-1/30 that IS doesn't quite cut it, especially if your aiming for the highest quality image possible. And RAW processing does not fix out of focus/blurry images.<br />  Of course if your budget for lenses is past 400-700, you better just spend your money on better lenses, because with that much money your expectations are too high for a low cost lens or your a professional. Best of luck in your photography pursuits!
B0030B811Q|5.0|Love this crazy, funny, zombie movie. Double Tap, Man! If you are looking for a serious, scary, zombie movie this isn't for you. It is just crazy fun.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Was a great read, kept me on my toes - but I would have like to see the ending have a bit more closure, and more details!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|the lack of browser interface from mobile device even using chrome.<br />Video streaming other than netflix, you tube and playstore
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game. I enjoy the variety and different little things along the way that keep it from getting boring and the same ole thing. ThAnks for a good fun game to enjoy...
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I have a 5 year old niece who really likes the jungle book. This a perfect gift for her.Again I like the prompt delivery
B009CG9LZI|5.0|Perfect for the whole family! One of my favorite Christmas movies. It's funny, sentimental and intriguing. I'm NOT a huge Jim Carrey fan, but he is so perfect for this role. Love anything Dr. Suess.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is fun but the constant request for money is VERY ANNOYING. If it is a free game keep it free or charge a fee and be done. I will delete it soon. I'll pay for a game once.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Let me start by saying that I absolutely love Gillian Flynn's first novel, Gone Girl. I think she's a truly great writer. I really enjoy how she delves into each character's personality and reveals their innermost workings with such honesty. Her books are always full of twists and turns that make me eagerly anticipate the conclusion. That said, if you enjoy books that keep you on the edge of your seat, questioning the motives and character of each person, you will definitely like this book. Very good read! I personally liked it just as much as Gone Girl. I also liked her book Sharp Objects, but I felt like I enjoyed the plot line and character development more in this book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It took me two attempts to get past the intro by the narrator, which seemed too abstract to me.  However, once I understood who the narrator was, and the story began, the book flowed and became very engaging.  This was certainly a sad story, but also beautiful and inspiring.  The historical view of the time between 1939-43 was informative to me.  The author takes foreshadowing to a new level, several times having the narrator outright tell the reader what's going to happen later in the story!  The book itself is full of spoilers.  I think that approach worked well, as it softened the intensity, and allowed the story to focus on the characters and their transformation leading to their impending defining moments.  The characters in The Book Thief were wonderful and very likable, even Rosa.  I listened to about 70% on audio and read the rest.  The reader did a great job with all the character voices and German cuss words!  Can't wait to see the movie later this month.
B0041D843M|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best written, convincing books I have ever read on Nutrition. It is difficult to study the book and not &#34; convert &#34; to vegetarianism. As a doctor I found the medical explanations and the many studies quoted very convincing. I wish the author many years of good health with his family and thank you for an amazing book.
B0081336FO|5.0|Love the series, just wish it had more episodes.  I would watch it forever if they made it. Please make more
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|Great alternative to PANDORA. Have not had any disconnections or long pauses between songs. Easy to use. Type in music genera or artist and there are various selections to choose from. So far the downside is the color scheme. When typing in search bar the black color of letters is hard to see against purple contrast. I got the app for FREE!!!! Really no complaints against that!
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Stop Dreaming, just do it :) you only have to be right one time and find your passion that you love.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|In the novel Dear John, the book is entitled to draw in all the romantic people. I personally loved all of Nicholas Sparks's books, and so far, Dear John was one of my favorites! Most people love books that end in a positive way, but, sadly this book doesn’t. I won't say what happens at the end, but I love the way it ended and endings of the book are meant to be powerful and this one definitely was. Throughout the book, each chapter was very intense and showed the true power of love through the characters John and Savannah. John is in the army, and has to leave Savannah after he fell in love with her on a break at home. They decided to continue their relationship long distance, and showed how powerful their love was, through their hardships they faced. Also, this novel was a great novel because Nicholas Sparks wrote in a way that left the reader wanting more at the end of the book. This book felt so real, and I could tell that Nicholas Sparks wanted to write a story that didn’t only show how amazing love is, but, he wanted to show how tough some relationships can be which made me love the story even more. Personally, I give this book 5 stars, because it was powerful and amazing all while it was sad at the same time. Nicholas Sparks never seizes to amaze me!
B005FRF6PC|3.0|I enjoyed reading about Rafa and gaining insight into his personal life and more importantly the mindset and habits that have made him one of the greatest players of a generation.  Rafa debunks the notion that anyone can compete on his level with his success on talent alone and credits his success with hard work and the team around him. Definitely words to live by. My only negative. If you want to call it that.  is that if you're looking for sizzle and scandal and entertainment, this is not the book for you.

B0018QQQK8|4.0|The Lucky One was written in an engaging way that made me never want to put it down. The book is made to show the struggles of an Iraq soldier, and, of course, your basic romance. Nicholas Sparks created a truly amazing book that I never wanted to put down. It kept me very involved and it almost felt like I was a part of the book.<br /><br />  Life has shown me that you really can find true love, and Nicholas Sparks proves this through his book. This is just one of the main ideas in his book. Logan, an Iraq veteran, returns home only to go and find his lucky charm and true love, Elizabeth. Logan uses her picture as inspiration to find his true love. Throughout the whole book, Logan never gives up his love for Elizabeth.<br /><br />  On a personal note, I truly enjoyed reading The Lucky One. It was one of the best books I have ever read. It is truly inspiring how Logan travels a long way just to find his true love. I really liked the way Sparks wrote the book. He left each chapter in suspense so all you wanted to do was keep reading. Although some of the reading may be a little difficult, I would recommend this book for anyone over the age 13. This romance novel will really touch your heart.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Like all John Grisham novels, once again this is a page turner.  His characters are so real and believable.  His style of writing is endearing.  Loved the story.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I live in an area with fairly high signal interference (that is, an apartment complex) from a large amount of wireless networks. Despite all that overlap, and multiple devices operating on or near the same bandwidth, I've never had any interference issues with this headset.<br /><br />I can't really speak for the mic quality yet as I haven't used it much for that.<br /><br />Physical design? Probably the best I've owned. They pivot in all the right places, the cushions fit comfortably without any noticeable pressure, the headband adjusts easily but not too easily, and most importantly it doesn't feel like you are ever putting any strain on the plastic - which is what has eventually broken every other headset I've owned.<br /><br />The audio quality is really excellent, and the headset is comfortable to wear for extended periods of time (in my case often 3-6+ hours.) The software included allows a fantastic amount of customization. I'm sure the programmable buttons are great for using voice effects and whatnot, although I haven't used them yet.<br /><br />The range is about what you'd expect, once you account for drywall and such. I can walk the length of my apartment without any real degradation. Soon as I'm outside, things begin to get fuzzy. I'd probably lose signal before the advertised distance, but purely because of walls. But two rooms over, no issues...and in this price range, you really can't get better than that.<br /><br />The battery life is great. They'll last about 10 hours of moderate usage on a charge. I define moderate usage as constantly having music on but not using the mic or turning the volume up past about 1/3 of the way (which is all I've found I need, with the &#34;noise cancel&#34; effect - that is to say they're designed well enough that simply placing them over your ears provides a decent noise reduction.) You can also charge them while using them near your computer, and the length of charging cable provided is beyond reproach. I'm not surehow I feel about having the usb receiver stick out the top of the charging cable &#34;tether, &#34; but I also didn't buy these things for the aesthetics of them sitting on my desk.<br /><br />In fact, my only real issue thus far is that they don't handle multiple sources all that well. That is, if you have music playing in the background and are also watching a video, you can tell the headphones are trying to pick a dominant &#34;stream&#34; to follow. I'm sure there are workarounds, and it honestly hasn't been enough of an issue for me to even explore those, but it is worth mentioning.<br />I also knew about that limitation going in. It's not unique to this headset by any means, and given the quality of my music library, I'd be surprised if they didn't have some issues with layers on top of those audio streams.<br /><br />I've always been pretty happy with Logitech headphones, and these are no exception.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|\\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" is the second movie in the rebooted \\"Star Trek\\" franchise, and, where the first one's awkward allusions to the original television series were endearing, this movie seems to be about a bunch of pathological personalities who live inside a video game. Cdr. James Kirk (Chris Pine) is reprimanded by Starfleet for violating the Prime Directive not to interfere with pre-warp cultures twice, on a whim, on the same mission. His mentor, Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), thinks Kirk should get a \\"second chance\\". But a rogue officer, Cdr. John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), has just blown up a Starfleet facility and fled to the Klingon home world Qo'noS. The very hawkish Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) thinks Kirk is the perfect man to go after him.<br /><br />Gene Rodenberry must be rolling in his grave. Granted the new \\"Star Trek\\" franchise has next to nothing in common with the various \\"Star Trek\\" television series and little in common with the long-running movie franchise, which was aimed more at sci-fi fans. This is intended to be a transnational product with little dialog, simplistic plots, and ample merchandising opportunities. But these characters could not even pass as 12-year-olds. Pubescent children at least try to act like they think adults would. None of these characters, not even Spock, is capable of controlling his emotions or his actions -not even for a little while. None have any ethics. The movie is more fascinated with crew members smooching than with any semblance of plot or dialog.<br /><br />The themes run something along the lines of: Kirk does a lot of bad things. Then someone else does even worse things. So Kirk decides to do better things. And the movie interweaves a new backstory for Khan, of \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\\" (1982). I think the writers were throwing a bone to the Trekkers there. Benedict Cumberbatch shows some of his usual charisma as the villain, which made me wish he had more screen time and better dialog. Apart from him, the entire crew is wallpaper. The casting director probably had to look far and wide to find a group of actors this unremarkable who could play 8-year-olds with ADD while wearing absurd 1960s-kitsch Halloween costumes. Oh, there are a lot of action sequences, but they're more likely to make you laugh than grip your seat.. Apart from him, the entire crew is wallpaper.

B00GOQ9M4O|2.0|Are there characters to believe in, or is human semblance the point? Two stars; sharknado deserves one. Besides, why does one star say 'hate'?

B00F031X62|5.0|I just love Jimi Hendrix and this recording from the Miami Pop Festival is a must for any Hendrix fan.  All these years after his death it is it a gift to be able to hear newly released material from his tragically short career.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Very happy with set, excellent deal, great service, would recommend.  Looking forward to getting season four once I have watched the first 3.
B00013RC8O|5.0|This is among the best outdoor cinematography I've ever seen.  The Colorado hills, valleys, and skies stretch out for miles in a thousand different shades of color and light.  This is the ultimate example of the subtle graduations and movements 35mm film can capture that digital cameras may never match.  Don't expect too much from the plot, which is just a suggestion of Americans' deep hunger for the freedoms and possibilities of the great frontier.  Just drink in the gorgeous wide open spaces of this blu ray on the largest HDTV possible.
B0037NVM2C|5.0|Such a classic. After 30 years, it is still one of the greatest movies that I've ever watched to this day.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|I rarely, if ever, do not finish a movie. I almost called it quits on this one, though. I felt like I was watching a video game for teenage boys - lots of CGI and vid game punching/kicking. I was reminded of an old arcade game I used to play in the 90s. Can't think of the name now. I'm not against a good spar here and there, but these were comical. Not much substance to this move overall. At least he was nice to look at, but that was about it for me.
B002N5N4M6|3.0|As always this series is funny but it's get more crude as each season passes.  However, I have enjoyed this comedy series more than any other.
B00EPL4PBK|4.0|I like it because it's Avenged Sevenfold. Good strong music. If you're a fan you won't be disappointed. ROCK ON DUDE!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|One of the better modern Bond films with lots of action.  The arrival of the villain in the last scene was a little predictable but for the music.  The Daniel Craig bond is a little more realistic with few gadgets in this one.  It was quite suspenseful throughout in my opinion.  Too bad about the house.<br /><br />Edit:  There are a number of reviews about the holes in the plot.  Like most films, it is a work of fiction.  If you are not a critic and just watch to enjoy the ride, you will like this movie.<br />James Bond movies in particular are not real. They take a lot of artistic license with their plots.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Enthralling read. Doesn't disappoint. It is something very different in a legal themed novel. Jake Brigance at his best. It is my hope Mr. Grisham  writes more novels with the Jake Brigance.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Love this show! Only have season 8 to purchase, then my collection is complete. I really miss the show already.
B002WTOXUK|5.0|To anyone who may read this: I am going to discuss the movie in its entirety, so spoiler alert.<br /><br />District 9 is a great movie with very complex characters. Initially, we are introduced to a humanoid species (referred to as prawns for their arthropodal appearance) from another planet who are portrayed as stupid, repulsive, violent, purposeless, and diseased among other things. To save the day is the naive Wikus van de Merwe, whose job it is to lead the relocation of over one million aliens. Right away, we see Wikus' inability as a leader and as an assertive figure in general. His position is a clear product of nepotism and his control over his subordinates is essentially nonexistent. Moreover, Wikus is shown to be incredibly stupid. However, once Wikus is exposed to a fluid that begins to transform him into a prawn, the audience is exposed to a suddenly morphed view of both the prawns and the humans. The documentary styled-film cuts to interviews in which people discuss the true intentions of MNU, the company leading the relocation of the prawns. Alien technology and weapons are shown to be incredibly powerful though inoperable by humans. MNU is shown to be a company willing to torture and murder individuals (humans and aliens alike) for the ability to harness alien technology and thus make financial gains. Simultaneously, the audience is introduced to Christopher Johnson, a prawn who is peaceful, intelligent, caring, and an overall good &#34;person&#34;. Halfway through the movie, the ability to classify aliens and humans as good and bad is lost entirely. Contradictions of this manner are the key method of provoking thought about how humans generalize one another that is utilized in this film.<br /><br />The film also draws striking parallels with current and historical events. The most obvious being the treatment of blacks and other non-white racial groups in South Africa during the time of apartheid. For over fifty years, the white population of South Africa was in charge of every aspect of the country and tried to separate the country by race. They felt themselves superior and demanded separation from non-whites in every way. Similarly, the humans of the film find living among the aliens burdensome and ban them from all human-inhabited areas. In fact, the humans put up signs around Johannesburg specifically to isolate prawns from human-only areas exactly like whites put up white-only signs around South Africa during the apartheid era. The abject conditions of the prawns are reflective of the conditions of refugees as well, and the place where they are forcibly placed - district 9 - is even referred to as a refugee camp. As such, the film explores the extremely poor conditions of refugees, specifically when Wikus is forced to spend his first night in District 9. I believe it is at this point that Wikus begins to understand the plights of the prawn, demonstrated symbolically through his increased transformation into an alien. The film uses this to make the commentary that people do not understand the lives of others until fully immersing themselves into the other person's life. These are just two examples of the film's attempt to connect people to the lives of the abject. District 9 shows that in fact, these individuals are no different from us, but subsequently reveals the unfortunate truth that humans are limited in their ability to empathize until being placed in the same conditions. On top of being a revealing insight into human limitation, District 9 is also an awesome movie.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This is a great book for young readers who would like to learn more about World War two. This book should be followed by discussions and more research on the history of the Holocaust.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|A lot of creativity. A nice read but it is one story over three books. So start with the first and be prepared to read the others if you like the first!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|This was such a fantastic read!  Laugh-out-loud funny and touchingly heartfelt at the same time, with illustrations that truly seemed to reflect what was going on in the author's head.  I couldn't put it down until it was finished, but it was certainly worth the sleepless night!
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Amazing episode! Who would have known that the Doctor was actually a Dalek who was just dreaming about being a Time Lord! And that regeneration into Peter Capaldi has to be the best I've ever seen. But that cliffhanger! Holy crap!
B00A3K2PZA|4.0|What can I say...it is William Friedkin, and all this time I  thought it was Michael Mann who made this movie, weird.<br />Great performance by McConaughey...the older he gets the better actor he becomes, or at least I like the roles he lately<br />chooses. This movie is like watching a mixture of: No Country for Old Man (2007) and Blood Simple (1984) interestingly both directed by the Coen brothers.  The ending is f....beyond words. Not your typical Hollywood ending I can tell you that much.
0345803507|5.0|A compelling love story comes out throughout the three books. With or without the kinky sex, the love story and the healing of Christian makes it a winner.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|A retarded man longs to become smart, but no one can even begin to predict what could possibly happen if his dream comes true.  More importantly, though, this book makes us take a step back from society and really analyze how we all &#34;fit in&#34; - the social adaptations we go through, the subtle nuances we engage in, and the extremely tenuous emotional bonds that tie us to, and keep us apart from, the people we know.
B00FAPU0UK|5.0|Pamala enjoys the feeling of danger when it comes to sex. Her bedroom games with Rick and Kevin are wild and unpredictable. When she catches the eye of a killer, you'd think you know the outcome, but a twist completely catches you by surprise.<br /><br />Erotica, suspence and a touch of horror goes hand in hand in this awesome story.
B008220D5K|5.0|Finally, Hollywood got it right.<br /><br />This film shows exactly how relationships look like 5, 10, 15 years down the road, and it does not really matter if you have the kids or not.  Paul Rudd is great as always.  Paul Rudd, Colin Farrell, Ryan Gosling, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Mathew McConaughey, and few more do KNOW how to choose their roles well.  But going back to THIS IS 40, one does get a feeling when watching this film that life in a relationship is about constant struggle to satisfy your partner...and it is easy to fall out of love with someone one has grown accustomed to live with.  The message behind THIS IS 40 is that little things matter, in the end it is talking and working things out, or making things work that matter, not the BIG WORDS, FANCY PRESENTS and the likes.<br />But of course that goes without saying, since everyone knows that (IRONY).
B00G32OER4|5.0|Long before shows like &#34;Ghost Adventures&#34; and &#34;Paranormal State&#34;, there was Ed and Lorraine Warren. Since the 1960's, the pair have been investigating and trying to help people afflicted by paranormal occurrences. This movie is based on a true story about one of their most terrifying experiences.<br /><br />Half of The Conjuring is a fairly typical ghost/demon possession story. There isn't really anything new in the story itself. It's just your average &#34;family moves into a haunted house&#34; kind of thing. But, the movie is so well-done that I loved it. The acting is almost perfect. And the suspenseful bits are perfectly timed. I often caught myself quivering and hoping that the movie would end soon. Not because it was bad but because I was a little TOO terrified.<br /><br />The other half of the movie is an abbreviated biography of the Warrens and what they do. They're portrayed as a likable young couple dedicated to helping the people who contact them. And, sometimes, the danger they and their loved ones have occasionally found themselves in because of what they do.<br /><br />In my opinion, it's up there with &#34;Amityville Horror&#34; as one of the best movies of its type.<br /><br />Fun fact: The real Lorraine Warren, who is now in her 80's, appears in one of the audiences while the actors playing Ed & Lorraine Warren are lecturing to a group.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|App with possibilities. Just gotta get a bit more savvy! Used to actually performing, not spinning. Adding to band gig this weekend.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The only thing that I do not like about this game is that there is only five lives. Then you have to wait forever.

B00G91WB3S|5.0|This is the best Superman movie I've seen in my 41 years of living, I look forward to the sequel :)
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|The games can be fun, although some seem impossible to do given the constraints.  But it's infuriating to be told that you have no more lives and you have to wait up to 1/2 an hour to resume playing.  I realize they want you to buy the full game where presumably you won't encounter that situation, but it's simply motivating me to find another game to play.
B001BR3P0S|5.0|It's a classic, how could one possible not like it? Unless you're a neo maxi zoom dweebie or other nerdly type.
0316322407|5.0|THIS BOOK GIVES SOME MUCH NEEDED INSIGHT INTO THE LIVES OF PAKISTANIS IN PARTICULAR AND MUSLIM BELIEFS IN GENERAL.  MALALA IS QUITE A WOMAN.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|I had high expectations for this book, but was disappointed.  The premise is interesting, and as a cautionary tale it could have been done quite well and been very scary.  But it wasn't done well.  The people who populate the Circle have a definite Stepford wives feel, and I kept waiting for the twist that explained why Mae turned into such an automaton so easily, like, say, a drug added to her smoothie to make her susceptible to brain-washing and manipulation.  Nope, turns out she is just that stupid.  And so are all the other Circlers, who are supposedly &#34;the best and brightest&#34;.  Unbelievable that in a room of thousands of supposedly smart people not a single one is capable of looking beyond the immediate technology cheerleading and imagine darker implications.  The characters are one dimensional and stereotypical.  Bleh.  Being clubbed over the head with the shark metaphor was insulting to my intelligence.  This could have been an important and thought-provoking book; unfortunately the clumsy execution made it very unsatisfying.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Lots of fun. The three skill levels present a good way to ramp up the challenge. Just wish there were more levels.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|My kid likes the game but anytime he saves up enough friend points or kibble to buy a house, the games immediately changes how much the things cost. My kid is constantly disappointed because of this crap game. Shame on you Gameloft or whoever made this rip-off!

B00BETX5PS|5.0|Outstanding movie, classic James Bond at his best. Not since Sean Connery has Bond had to use more his wits than his gadgets, great action movie and spy thriller.
B00004W50T|5.0|Perhaps one of the strongest records of the past 50 years. Eric Clapton wanted to quit Cream and join The Band after he heard this record.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|Not happy with this book--if I had known it was going to end the way it did, I wouldn't have even bothered to begin the series.  I love the characters, but I read books to get lost in a non-realistic world, that I think should have a happy ending-hello, this is a teen drama.  I think Roth could've still put the point across of self sacrafice and selflessness without ending it the way she did.  Boo!
1401242855|5.0|If you love Batman, old or young (well, not too young) you should buy this. Just buy it! And also the mask is a very, very good replica of The Court of owls' mask. Like I said... just buy it.

B00FAVRHBE|5.0|This is one of the best long running show of all times.  I can't wait to get this and know I will love it each time that I watch it.  It also brought my family closer together.  Hard to believe that a show can do that but it did.
B00B89LZ4C|3.0|It's ok. Likeness is pretty good down to the money bag. But, a bit expensive due to popularity of movie at the time.
B008602KQI|1.0|Absolutely horrible DVD quality. I buy a lot of DVD through Anazon. I bought this one - watched once - worked well -  a couple months later I tried to watch again and DVD did not work - center of disc discolored and cannot be read by any DVD Player. All my discs are properly stored - this one was obviously sub par disc or defective. I am just too disgusted to even return - plus time lapse of months. Just not worth my time. Will NEVER use this fulfillment house again. Just bad business.

1476734941|5.0|This is simply a follow up to Mosley's documentary.  I read through it one time.  Plenty of recipes for those who are befuddled about what to eat.  I just keep a quick note of foods we eat on a regular basis and stick to same routine on fast days.  Hubby takes a morning drink.  I tend to have poached eggs with strawberries and yogurt to get my 250 in the morning.  Then I simply use a low or no sodium organic soup in evening with added greens / onions from garden and mushrooms.  We just started this September.  His blood sugar has dropped as well as weight lost.  My blood work is still outstanding, but have lost a few ounces.  I'm sure added exercise is the key to my personal weight loss.  Progress not perfection...Some fast days are better than others.  Started in September 2013.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Great price on Amazon!  If you're a fan of Les Mis, this is a &#34;must have&#34;!  What it lacks from the stage version in fabulous singing voices, it makes up in scenery and earthiness!
B000LXQVA4|5.0|I bought this for the little one when he was about 6 months and he loved it the first time he got in it. Great way for babies to get some energy out if they are not crawling yet!
B00D23GXB2|5.0|From the shocking title ''Revenge of the Orgasm'' the author prepares the reader for a shockingly good content. I've read only poetry about different types of landscapes so far and this poetical genre was something new for me. The author does a good job, though - the words are well picked, so that the story flows well and reads easy. Excellent read!
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album. Personally, I think it's their best. Every song is great, though I do have several favorites: &#34;Snap Out Of It&#34;, &#34;Do I Wanna Know&#34;, &#34;Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High&#34;, &#34;Fireside&#34;, and &#34;One for the Road&#34;. I've been listening to it practically non-stop since I downloaded it four weeks or so ago, and I don't think I'll be getting sick of it any time soon. The music and lyrics are a bit more evolved than the Monkeys' previous albums, and there's just something about Alex's voice (especially on &#34;Snap Out Of It&#34; and &#34;Do I Wanna Know&#34;) that just speaks to musical growth and different influences than before.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Although this book is meant to young readers it was a great story. Very sad but also a good reminder to find the good things in life where y to you can.
0375842209|5.0|Wonderful book--lots of food for thought about the power of words!!  Just hope that the movie does it justice--as it does not always do this when the book is excellent.
0500517061|5.0|Beautiful book and truly amazing pictures.  Hard to believe people actually lived like that back then.  If you have any interest in imperial Russia at all, this is truly a great addition to any library.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|A great collection of 26 Beatles classics from 1962-66 (a mix of single and choice LP cuts), a great intro to the band for new fans, and hardcore fans (like me) enjoy this collection as well. BTW,the song lineup/selection was compiled by the late George Harrison.<br />Highly recommended!
B00CHCUR9I|5.0|My first contact with The Walking Dead was through the AMC series. Reading the comics was always on my to do list and today I've read the first issue. Fans of the television series will see how dead on the casting is and the message from the creator of the series emphasizes it's about the characters and not zombies.
B006LXQID8|5.0|Amazing film, so many cute moments and the scenery is beautiful to say the least. It makes me want to travel to France.
B00FF8OKJE|4.0|It's 'free', but if I wanted to stay alive, in the game, I ended up using real money.  This put me at a disadvantage to people with more disposable income than I.  It is a fun game and it's addicting.  Going off-line at night to sleep is dangerous, it may be a bit slow paced but while your sleeping (or at work) disasters can and do hit, this also puts you at a disadvantage.<br /><br />As long as you know this before going into the game, it can be enjoyable.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|A great collection of 28 Beatles classics from 1967-70 (a mix of single and choice LP cuts), a great intro to the band for new fans, and hardcore fans (like me) enjoy this collection as well. BTW,the song lineup/selection was compiled by the late George Harrison.<br />Highly recommended!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This is a good app it show you step by step a but it goes just a little bit fast and I really love it and I hope you will to
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have played Mahjong for some years it has become a favorite of mine because of the challenge. I play soduko so I enjoy the most unknown outcome to create that challenge.  I think I have a game I can love and get that challenge.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  It's not just plain solitaire....you need to concentrate and decide the best move in order to score high.  I would recommend this game to anyone.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|In my opinion, probably the best movie of all time. This is a masterpiece and required a couple viewings to really appreciate it. I enjoy all genres and this is just a great film.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My little pony is very important for the world you can build your own world :ZAIDA PS:this is for Matt magnon the claw machine player PS I like you as my BOYFRIEND
0143034901|5.0|Phenomenal book - I love the way the novel is written and have enjoyed Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's style of writing in every one of his works.  Beautiful prose, highly recommended.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Captivating read, waiting for the next half. I would recommend this book to all that enjoy a series. it has you turning the page faster just to keep up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|5 star rating.  Fiction that is believable makes for a very good book. The book is definitely a page turner.  I normally don't skip to the end of the book to find out the ending, but I had to this time.
B008M0NDOK|1.0|It only works with the games it says not all games. Game loft are the only games this controller works wit, but not all games. Not worth it.
1250037751|4.0|This was a recommendation from my aunt (a book lover and voracious reader) and she obviously knows me because I really liked it. I don't read a lot of non-fantastic fiction but this definitely worked for me. It's lite, funny, creative and I loved the (mock) role playing game references and other attachments to geekdom (as in kingdom, not as in geek dom that's something completely different) that a couple of the characters had. The writing was witty and as I've been writing a lot as of late I found myself at least a couple times thinking, &#34;I like that, I want to use something like that in my book.&#34;<br /><br />A fun quick read and the narrator of the audio book was a perfect fit.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Imaginative and disturbing. The idea of steam-taking vampire Travellers was unique and fascinating. King has not lost his edge - I doubt he ever will.
0300169787|5.0|If you think fashion is boring, look at this book. Come on. Alexander McQueen was the man. Just look at the cover. LOOK AT IT. It wiggles if you move your head from side to side. Or maybe that's just me. Anyway, fashion is not boring and neither is this book.
B003DES8I6|5.0|The boys are back and they are crazier than ever! This movie was so incredibly fun to watch that I watched it twice within a 24 hour period. If you haven't been introduced to these 2 goof ball assassins, start off with Boondock Saints and follow-up with this one. Just one laugh right after the other and a good movie also. Watch this and you won't be disappointed.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Love all of the jack reacher books. They are smooth reads that you cannot put down.  This one is the best.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Watched it once in an outdoor setting at my Tech school but missed a lot because of my children. Now I see the whole thing and damn was it bad. The story jumps around a lot and well Superman has no balls, except the desire to save people, He could have fought back and maybe would go too far once and then get branded a freak, but he never does. Not once, her takes abuse and still loves humans? Maybe they should have showed his parents talking to him more.<br /><br />This could have been done way better. Just no flow and well a lot of just yelling by Superman.  How he becomes a reporter with Lois knowing the deal was weak at best. Let put it this way, they rebooted Hulk because they knew it sucked. Maybe this one will get the same treatment?
B006CUDDUG|5.0|John Le Carre, where have you been all my life? I am a huge fan of British novels featuring people in sweaters hiding their emotions from one another. I thought P.D. James was good but Le Carre just keeps the alienation flowing like a morphine drip. He's a poet. I'm not a big fan of spy novels but this is something special.
B00992CF6W|1.0|it won't download. I tryed everything but its not in cloud including restarting. nothing works. you bothered to.make it not work with my machine. I hate this.
B00F031XPS|4.0|Hendrix through rose- er, purple-colored glasses.<br /><br />Performance footage, as they say in Variety, is well-done, more than well done in fact, and the inclusion of the Miami Pop is nothing short of brilliant. Now where is that Albert Hall genius lurking? In the vaults?<br /><br />The screening confirmed my feeling about avoiding the ominous anniversary of Hendrix’ death – September 18 – in favor of the date of his arrival on this Third Stone from the Sun: November 27, when I give thanks for this genius’ brief shining flame on the guitar horizon. The little girl whose mom married Al Hendrix, Janie Hendrix, she too looks through those purple colored glasses when she reflects on the lanky guitar player who came back to Seattle to visit. As the executive producer of these recordings – and executrix of the estate – Janie has glossed over the legacy to include testimony from the anointed folks who pass muster with her crowd, and that is my solitary quibble.<br /><br />It’s understandable that the doc doesn’t dwell on the forensics of Jimi’s death, which have been disputed almost as long as their counterparts in and around Dealey Plaza in Dallas. But the history that is recorded by this august company omits the remembrances of some who are not kosher in the eyes of the new estate. Folks like record producer Alan Douglas, who guided the estate and promoted the posthumous Hendrix mystique before losing his job at the hands of Experience Hendrix LLC’s lawyers; electronics genius Roger Mayer, who first introduced Hendrix to the wonderful world of effect pedals, in December 1966 and collaborated with the guitarist until Hendrix’s death in 1970. Hendrix once called Mayer “the secret of my sound”; Kathy Etchingham, who lived with Hendrix in a flat on Brook Street and later wrote the memoir ”Through Gypsy Eyes”; Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Pete Townshend, the guitarists most blown away by Hendrix’ prowess when he came to town.<br /><br />I would have liked to hear some of that but it's just castles made of sand, isn't it?ld have liked to hear some of that but it's just castles made of sand, isn't it?
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|More of a kids game...after reading reviews I think I was expecting a bit more. Then again, I only played the first few levels
B003G4W49C|4.0|It was very well written, caught my attention right away.  Dealt with some very tricky issues, heart rending issues, beautifully.  I hold back the 5th star probably for the very reason some would give it a fifth star - the application of certain types of languages, although very realistic, took away from the joy and excitement of reading a such a good book.  I loved the sequels to Ender's Game.  This author has thought of and formulated some great, in-depth characters.  Thank you Orson Scott Card.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|An excellent book, better than the previous versions. I understand that the target audience for these books in the Divergent series is young adult, but I enjoyed them! Allegiant held some surprises, was well written and held my attention to the last.  Highly recommend this series and especially this book.
0061537969|4.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is a story of unconditional love. I enjoyed the story and all of the characters. Enzo is adorable as the story teller. Denny's character tugs at the heart strings. Even the ending is  totally believable if your beliefs are likened to the story fo Peter Pan  You really can fly......
B008IZYW3U|3.0|Not my usual type of music I listen to, but beautiful duos and really great to listen to in the car when traveling.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Guess my wife figured we needed it in the cabinet to watch all year is why she bought it.  I am sure we will enjoy it many times.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|what can i say! I love this game. most people I know play this game. thank you for making it available for frewh
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Devastatingly funny; heartbreakingly self-revealing.  In particular, &#34;Identity&#34; reminded me of the kind of soul-searingly painful self-awareness work we did in seminary.  To see it there with pictures, laid out for the whole world, was humbling. Bravo, Allie!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Was hard for me to conceive dead speaking.got me of track,at times.I love the story.first time from a German side.there were tears and laughter.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I love Stephen King and found this book quite good, as an amateur write and hopeful someday author. I always love reading what writers have to say about their writing processes, habits, and rituals. Interestingly enough, it was while writing this book that King took a break to take a walk and clear his head was he was hit by a car and suffered a near fatal accident. Makes reading the entire book more special that he recovered and was able to go on and continue his wonderful writing career. A true heroic writer in my book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Some of the levels are WAY too hard to get through and it gets very frustrating when I get stuck on one level for days and days!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|It starts a bit slow but picks up nicely. A well told story that is interesting and informative about a world we know little about
B000002AGN|5.0|I was so happy to find this again. I remember my college days studying with this. I am so glad that you helped me find it.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Great short story. Engaging plot that eases you into the strange, other-world of the story. Love the simple premise of strange things happening along a stretch of highway. Like typical King stories, it uses everyday elements that become sinister, strange, and finally grab you.  It was a quick read. I was very excited to see King embrace the idea of Kindle singles. Fast way for writers to get their new material out and for readers to happily consume new material from their favorite writers.
B007E6Z94U|2.0|After hearing many things about this, I decided to start watching. Season 1 was off to a slow start, but it was short and I went on to Season 2 hoping to have things start happening. Instead, the show grinds to a halt and spend most of it's time on fabricated and avoidable personal conflict. The characters seem to go out of their way to create valuable rules and ideas that they promptly ignore to further the tension resulting in a drab show that seems like Mad Men with zombies.
0385537131|4.0|It was a very well written book, as usual.  I've read all of Grisham's books, but this was not one of my favorites.  I did enjoy the trial and court room drama.  That's when he shines and it's hard to put the books down.  I would recommend it, it just wasn't one of my favorites.
B00E9A656K|1.0|I wish l didn't have to put a star!  I hate this game!!!  its babyish and u always lose! boring!!!
B003YL4L0W|4.0|Moving story about family and relationships and the healing power of music. Very much enjoyed this inspiring tale of hope and giving to others.
B0019T7PC2|1.0|Apparently this is a &#34;region 2&#34; movie, whatever that is, so it doesn't work in any of the different DVD players that we have. The company is apparently from England and I didn't know that since the name was something like US films! Needless to say the shipping back would cost more than the movie. Very disappointed!! Be careful what movies u buy from here!
B00G32OMF8|3.0|I had higher expectations because of the previous movies in the trilogy.  I had a hard time believing a couple would talk the way they did in this movie at this point in their relationship.  I don't want to give anything away so I'll let you be the judge.  I just wouldn't go in with the expectations this movie is as good as its predecessors.
B008602KQI|5.0|I saw (to me) a new (and very good) actress, the script was completely different from anything else out nowadays, the premise of the story and ending left me wanting more. Their world was not so far removed from ours and believable, the blending of past and future technologies piqued one's interest. Not having read the books, the movie stood on its own. I rented this movie when it became available, and just watched it again on Amazon. This time, I was much more impressed by the depth and scope of the story, and Jennifer's ability to carry it on her shoulders.
B00004U45G|4.0|This overlooked gem rocks!  All are in the Led Zep format, even the Crows cuts.  And all of them sizzle.  Delivery and service were good.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I liked this movie. It was very entertaining. A fresh concept in a movie. I can not wait to see the second installment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down<br />Exceeded my expectations entirely. Cannot wait to Starr the next book tomorrow night! Hope you all enjoy
0060752610|3.0|the edge of pages sucks....anything else looks fine and the book is new. recommended by someone in the industry for basic reading on stocks.
B00DWZHTOU|2.0|I purchased this movie because I am interested in stage magic, and the fact that the movie provided a bit of insight into how stage magic is done is the only thing that saved it from a one-star rating.  The movie's vague message is something of an &#34;Occupy Wall Street meets Houdini&#34; sort of thing, in which a fuzzy anti-corporate theme is fused with a confusing and often contradictory theme  about the joys of magic, as well as a sub-plot concerning the existence of an ancient magical group known as The Eye.  But, apart from the ecstasy of throngs of people seeing money rain down on their heads, there is little sense of joy in this movie.  It all seems a bit forced, like the wild enthusiasm of the hired fans thronging the stage at a Super Bowl halftime show.  The movie straddles the border between realism and fantasy, and works as neither.<br /><br />The four youthful magicians, brought together for some vague purpose they don't entirely understand, are thoroughly unlikeable people, very different from most real magicians I have encountered.  They are smug, arrogant, and vulgar.  They use their magic in a Robin Hood sort of way, to rob banks and corporate strongholds, and then shower the booty onto their adoring fans.  In the process, they even rob from their erstwhile corporate sponsor, represented by Michael Caine, who then turns on them.  Because their crimes are international in scope, they attract the attention of both the FBI and Interpol.  The interplay between the American FBI agent and his (female) French Interpol counterpart creates few sparks, and I could not develop much of an interest in either of them.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is cast as a former magician turned debunker, and by the end of the film he meets his match in a surprising way, but by then I really didn't care what happened - I kept glancing at my watch, counting down the movie's 115 minutes.  It was never quite clear what Freeman's purpose was, who he was working for, or whether he switched sides at some point - it was just plain confusing.<br /><br />I wouldn't watch this movie again.  Why watch a movie filled with people you don't like?
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love the game so far! My only negative about it is the Dragon costing 750 crowns! The time it would take to earn that many through the game is going to take forever. Honestly who has 40$ they can drop for one item in the game. I think it's kinda ridiculous otherwise I would have given 5 stars.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Used to place regular castleville on my computer but quit a couple years ago. Installed this and can't put my kindle down!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham can make any topic easy to understand. I really enjoyed his return to characters and events that were familiar to his loyal readers.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|this game finds way of staying fresh. it isn't as repedative as most of the pic games I've run across. they put some work into this one.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|It's well written and you feel like you are in the character's situation and &#34;what would I do&#34; always comes to mind.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm crying enough said! In love it it is the best book   carries I have ever read! Solo cool!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is fantastic. I am taking french next semester, and I wanted to get ahead so that I am not completely in the dark next semester. this app madebthat possible.
B0018OAOQC|5.0|I can't say anything negative about Volbeat.  Michael Paulson's writing and voice are incredible.  There's not one song I don't like.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|The final season came too quickly.  Some very interesting plot twists as the series approached the finale.  The characters and their relationships remained fresh and complex.  I really feel this series had many more years of potential.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A wonderful ride into the future and other worlds. A deep search into our inner humanity and the myriad aspects to our nature. Humans are rarely one-dimensional, and Card was able to convey the inner demons we face with every decision Ender and His siblings made.  A metaphor for this life. Great read!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lots of fun to play.  Interest twists on match three.  Gives my brain a welcome break from work.  Fun to watch the icons explode and regroup.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Every once in awhile one comes upon a book that not only entertains but offers a lesson. This book did that for me. With vivid characters and futuristic undertones I learned we are often not alone in this world even when we have no one physically around..we can not escape the good or evil that dwells within. With fast moving chapters and good insight into what the characters were thinking, I really enjoyed this book. Hope to read more from this series.
B00785P2QC|4.0|They push hard for you to buy upgrades with real money as usual games like this do but still a good time killer.
B000FC12ZA|5.0|This is a book I will remember all my life. I started it two days after my partner was diagnosed with breast cancer and finished it two days after she underwent mastectomy. It was suggested to me by my Natural Doctor. She never said why.<br />I already practice homeopathy for years now but the medicine this book is referring to is something that goes beyond, something that comes from within. It is the connection with Oneness that brings us back to where we belong, to our innate power.<br />You may take this book literally or not but for sure it is a thought provoking one.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|We watch it at least once a week. The theme song will get stuck in your head. Great message. Fun.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I own the DVD and was obsessed with this movie when it was first released, as I am now that I own the blue ray version.  I have never seen the stage performance and would be hesitant now because after watching this lush, romantic, passionate, stirring rendition I am afraid the stage production would be a letdown.  The melodies haunt me long after the viewing has ended.  I think the casting was brilliant.  The dark, magnetic pull between the Phantom and Christine is believable and strums every romantic string my heart possesses.  Gerard Butler portrayed the Phantom with depth and evokes compassion for the isolation and tortured life that shaped him.  I can watch this film again, and again, and again (and I do).
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was hard to put down.  The characters lives were very intertwined, and it was a great story.  Read it!
1401938906|5.0|I love the book- The writing is friendly and personal. The tests are easy and fun. Most importantly, the tests work!
B00C7607BC|5.0|Classic. I don't like that it took so many years for it to be available again but my kids love it now.
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|This is the best out of all the movies!  I typically love the 1st soundtrack in series because they are always well thought out and not rushed.
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|Bigger action figure than we could find at the store.  My son will love to play with this figure while watching Man of Steel.
B00GDL5HNA|5.0|I have the regular edition but the extra songs are great! Especially the acoustic versions. Too bad they didn't have a add on feature for the additional tracks.  Would love if they made an all acoustic album!
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|A great singer singing great songs! This album combines the mainly secular songs of Barbra Streisand's two previous Christmas albums.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's not perfect, sometimes the feed is a little grainy, and sometimes a reboot of the computer is required to make it work better, but for the most part it's pretty good. And for the price, it's awesome. By comparison to an A-TV that costs 3x as much but has superior quality (but still requires a reboot sometimes to fix an audio issue), I pretty  just bought several of the Chromecasts and can use that just fine for every TV in the house. Overall, extremely happy with this.
B00C5R8364|5.0|If you are a Forsyth fan you will love the book. It reminded me of Day of the Jackal except with more current problems and solutions. There are two parallel stories that only intertwined at the end. I enjoyed the book, it kept me involved.
0307476073|5.0|This book took me on a surprising adventure, one that I would have never chosen to go on by myself. As the writer transformed through the story, I also felt renewed and inspired. Excellent!
B00DJZR46G|5.0|great Elton John recording! I love the passion in the lyrics as well as the music. In some ways it is traditional Elton John fair, but so good!
006202406X|5.0|This was by far the best of the trilogy. All if the right choices were made and it just is great
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|This wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  I don't know exactly what I didn't like about the plot it just seemed a little too hokey for me.
1476727651|5.0|The original King is back! Those who have read him from the beginning will see it and perhaps the newbies will fall in love with his stories all over again. Good vs Evil with all the human frailties thrown in.
B003K15IF8|3.0|A Sad Life!<br />Interesting but a bit depressing, this story of a man who succeeded in leaving the family farm for college. He never seems to be in charge of what is going on. Mistakes in life choices continue to rule his life to the end.
006202406X|1.0|I'm going to try to keep this to the point and spoiler free so here goes. I found the reason why no one was allowed outside the city was cliche and poorly handled. There were too many new characters introduced. The ending didn't match the previous books and thus felt like a betrayal. I understand that plot twists are supposed to be unexpected but there was absolutely no foreshadowing and the messages about life and death and choice and identity were not upheld by her ridiculously and unnecessarily tragic ending. Roth succumbed to the two most popular tropes included in every YA dystopia: 1) the ending is crappy and disappointing 2) the government is not only tyrannical but creepily involved in its peoples every move and action. I find both of these tropes unrealistic because I believe that books in a series should all &#34;match&#34; each other in tone and purpose and because the government was so similar to the governments in other books in the same genre in the way it controls its people and the reasons why it controls them
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It wont allow to play any video crushes right after i click on 1 not recommended. I am watching YT thru Silk.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was recommended by several friends, so I decided to read it. The storyline was okay; yet, I didn't like the ending and was waiting for something better. It was very anticlimactic.
B00GHJ6BJW|3.0|If anyone knows about “pop”, it’s Lady Gaga. She released her debut album five years ago and has already become one of the most popular singers ever. That’s quite a feat. Whether it had more to do with talent or luck is a question this album makes it difficult to answer. It’s far from spectacular, but her hooks are generally better than average and catchy hooks are very important. I just wish she’d ride them out more. The Dope ballad, for example, sounds almost anticlimactic because the refrain never goes for longer than four bars.<br /><br />The album’s best moments come via Gypsy, the final fifty seconds of which are both awesome and exhilarating. If the whole song sounded that great, it would be an instant classic. The worst parts of the album can be found not in the music but in the lyrics of the songs. Venus has on it the kind of stale space-love lines The B-52s might’ve used. “Manicure” as a pun for “man-cured” is just plain stupid. But, for what it’s worth, Lady Gaga’s music is aesthetically on par with, if not better than, that of Madonna, her most obvious influence.<br /><br />marcellee.com
0761172726|5.0|I could not operate without this calendar. I have four kids with busy schedules. Each kid gets his own column - how brilliant is that?! I can see at a glance who needs to be where when. The boxes are a bit small, but what do you expect when there are columns for 5 people and a month at a glance? If they were any bigger, this wouldn't be a calendar, it would be a wall hanging. Holidays are preprinted and the pictures are cute but I don't feel like I'm using a baby calendar. And it's a 17 month calendar. How many times have you missed an appointment because it's in January and you didn't have your January calendar yet? It comes with 500 sticker that I don't use on the calendar, but my kids have fun sticking on random things. The only improvement I can come up with is some way to attach a pen.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|This movie was really good. Better than Superman Returns which barely had any action. This one kinda overdoes it on the action though. I really wished this would get a trilogy on Superman alone but it looks like they're gonna dump Batman into the sequel. Superman deserves 3 solo movies before doing a team up movie.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Love, love, love this book. The story captured me from the beginning. I cannot wait to read other books by this author.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|A lovely story - a lovely man!! Very much enjoyed and loaned to friends who also liked it. A story with a happy ending!
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Tales will understand the rating. Once again Cornwell delivers in this continuation of the adventures of Uhtred in post-Roman Britain. The contradictory loyalties of our hero provide many opportunities for drama and, often, wry humor. The strategic manuever and battles of conflicting political and cultural forces never disappoint. I'm anticipating the publishing of the next, and last, book in the series but it will be sad to leave the Tales behind.
B007Z9QTVI|5.0|INTELLIGENCE has no borders or barriers or class or end.  Helping others on the path of improving themselves is a double reward - one for the sender of the gift and one for the receiver of the gift.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|Well, that was a mistake.  This movie misses it on too many accounts.  I can appreciate a movie that has some continuity issues if it makes up for it in plot, but this was not one of them.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I play this game more on my phone because it takes to long on kindle fire for upgrades. I have 24mill in coins I'm waiting to use on new tracks and vehicles. please upgrade soon
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It's fun but not fast paced enough. The dragons should be cheaper or at least one free one. Need crowns for to many purchases.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved every single line of this book. Leaves me begging for the next book!! Cannot wait for all of the movies!
B000VX3832|5.0|A nice casual shoe for school or work, The shoe was bought for my teenage son. He wears a size 12.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Best driving game I have ever played in a long time with great graphics to the game also love the way the cars look.
B00GMONG90|5.0|Their arrangements are always nice. Well done.  I was glad there were original songs along with covers.This was a good mix of songs.

B004XCUEU2|5.0|If you're a music fan, and the kind of person who can appreciate something even more once you've learned about its history, this film is for you.  For those who don't know, Foo Fighters is the band assembled by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as he began the next musical chapter of his life, this time as a frontman.  It might be a stretch to say that if you weren't already a fan of Foo Fighters music that this film would make you one, but if you are intrigued by shows like &#34;Behind The Music&#34; and can appreciate the journey of a bonafide rockstar basically starting over, this film might just do it.<br /><br />I've always liked them but after seeing this it made me like them even more, learning about their journey from a group of musicians assembled to play the music from Dave's self-made demo tape to millions of albums sold to the recording of their last album &#34;Wasting Light&#34; in Dave's garage.  It doesn't only cover the history of Foo Fighters but of each member's personal stories and how they all came to the point in their career when they joined Foo Fighters and how the experience has been for each of them.  I think it was a very smart move to include the footage of them making the Wasting Light album, as this film was released just before the album.  Watching them make that album made me instantly attached to it and when I listen to it I love thinking back to the film and remembering the stories behind the songs and what was going on while they recorded it.<br /><br />The most interesting part of this film for me was how Dave fought to get past being known as just &#34;the drummer from Nirvana&#34; and wanted this to be a real band with its own identity.  Considering the level of success he has already reached before Foo Fighters, starting over and touring clubs in a van is not something everyone would do!  Enjoy the film and get Wasting Light!
0440539811|5.0|I just got passed like the first 100 pages of the book and it seems pretty enlightening, although too bizzare at times (i mean, what's the point of that random sexual content and sudden change of settings?). I bought it to get a proper opinion on the whole Illuminati thing, since just watching videos on youtube or reading articles on blogs wouldnt quite cut it for me to be 100% sure on whether the whole thing is just a conspiracy or reality. However, can someone please tell me how reliable the sources and the facts pointed out on it are? I'd rather not start doing research in every issue there to tell if it really happened, all i ask is that i know whether anything that is said to have happened in this book has trully happened. I'd really appriciate the opinion of anyone who has done proper research in this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's fantastic as you could guess. Don't read the last one make up a story in your head it'll be a better one.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Great game until Level 25. It no longer wants to work. I have read its a common problem for the kindle fire. Other than that i loved it. But i never purchased Anything with real money.
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|It's Def Leppard. What else is there to say? I've waited a long time for a new live video. This is a definite \\"Got To Have It\\" for the Def Leppard fan. The holidays are coming and this would be a perfect gift. Video, Audio, and Classic songs. What could be wrong with that? Thank you, Joe, Sav, Phil, Viv, and Rick. You inspire my life!
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|Superb film, the kids love it.  The quality in Blu-ray is second to none and is a must have for all Blu-ray player holders.
B001NA6096|5.0|This film made me belueve in cinema again.  No action. No sex. Just the genius of acting and a story.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Works great on my fire HD.  Always looking for new games to play and I can't get enough of this one.  Only complaint is that it takes too much time from my reading g
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game .it is hours of fun .I am glad I found u we to play it along time ago.I hope it stays working on here .
B009O2XY12|1.0|Have to be honest started installing this game and while waiting I read the reviews, which made me decide not to waste my time and uninstalled. After all who wants to start playing something that will bother you  for money and not let you keep playing.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I enjoy this game. It is very addictive. I find myself playing when I should be doing other things. A must buy.
0811879542|5.0|We had borrowed this from the library and both my 6 and 3 year old loved it so much we bought it.
B001RIY4WE|3.0|The disc case......well, is a joke......<br />Just like some kind of recycling material......for tasting, then you can sell it.<br />But good price for the feature contents.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Let me start off by saying I am very disappointed in this book. I am a huge fan of this series but this one just wasn't as strong as the first two.<br /><br />It started off descent, had some bad and good moments then you have the heartbreaking ending. After reading the ending it has damaged the whole series for me, I was looking forward to re-reading it but I don't know if I can (especially now that I know how it ends) And I have been looking forward to the movie, I keep watching the same preview over and over again and I just don't know if I will even be able to watch it now.<br /><br />I don't know why Veronica made the ending the way she did (I cried, and I mean cried A LOT! and I had to keep telling myself, its just a book-its not real). I'm sure I'm not the only fan that is disappointed and a bit pissed.<br /><br />I feel like a piece of me was stolen after a certain part happened in the end, which is an odd way to describe it, but I don't know how else to. When you are a book lover and really get into the book(s) you are reading they somehow become apart of you and I feel like a piece of me was taken after this ending.<br /><br />So I will end by saying that I honestly wish I didn't even start the series, What is the point in the series if it gets the ending Roth gave it????????
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was my pick for book club a few years ago.  All ladies in the group enjoyed it which doesn't happen much.
0399255370|5.0|A wonderfully clever story book for everyone.  Who doesn't like to remember happy hours spent with a new box of Crayons and a coloring book. You will love reading this book yourself and also reading it to your little one.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Not as good as the show. She spends a lot of time making half-hearted socioeconomic commentary that is really quite bland. She also comes off as the best, most composed, nicest person you ever did imprision. Jenji Kohen's Piper is way more interesting. Don't waste your time.
B003G4W49C|4.0|It's confusing like who's talking and stuff but it's a good book it set u in moods and stuff so yeah
B008QTVNUI|5.0|best show on the planet. just going to put that out there.<br />the plot is famazing<br />carrie and brody blow my mind.<br />brody is a famazingly flawed and spectacularly frustrating character.<br />this show needs to be watched and fangirled over byy every person on the planet.
B004AUFVU0|5.0|Excellent -wonderful story<br />Love the actors & acting is great<br />Sophisticated<br />It stands the test of time<br />I'm a great jack lemmon fan
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Need more levels. Extremely addictive game. Loads of fun. I have spent lots of time trying to figure out the clues. Great adventures.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is a delightful addition to the farm genre. The graphics are rich, and the interface is smooth. I am not yet sure if you have to post to Facebook or the like, or if it can be played without buying the premium currency a lot. So far it seems quite fun.
B000OCXIDK|3.0|BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.<br />I WAS SO EXCITED AND AFRAID FOR THIS FAMAZING AFAIR THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN BETWEEN GRIET AND VERMIER.<br />AND NOTHING HAPPENED.<br /><br />LITERALLY.<br />NOBODY SHOULD READ THIS BOOK IF THEY EXPECTED SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.<br />I'M NOT JOKING.<br />ALL HE DID WAS STARE AT HER, PAINT HER, AND *OMFG SHOCKS, DIES, THE WORLD SHOULD SHATTER* HE TOUCHES HER FACE.<br />im not kidding if you value your sanity you shuldn't read this book because as beautiful as it was it was amazingly frustrating.... just saying.
B00G32TD98|2.0|Fair tv movie<br />Starts off well but can't sustain the<br />story without silly special effects<br />I think they killed off the writer before<br />the script was finished<br />Maybe a 15 year old would find it more<br />believable (?)
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Love Harry Bosch, an old-time police officer frustrated by the new law enforcement;  however, Harry always comes out the winner and solves the case.  More Harry please, excellent read; also enjoy the descriptions of Los Angeles area.  Mr. Connelly is a very gifted write. Harry Bosch would make an excellent TV series, with William Peterson playing Harry.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Beautiful documentary. Maybe not the first guy you'd want to have a beer with, but it's not like he's running for president.
030759565X|5.0|Oh my goodness!  Every recipe I have tried has been absolutely scrumptious!!  And I have not felt intimidated at all.  Deb writes in such a personal and real way that I feel compelled to cook.  I love how thoughtful she is about minimizing the steps to the essential ones - and reducing the dishes too!!  Very delicious, very thoughtful, well-written!
B0091VYG86|4.0|I really liked this film. Fun to watch & Reese Witherspoon & Toby McGuire are great.<br />It's a nice cleaned up, simplistic version of color as a basis of racism but it makes its point
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This young lady is so intelligent and aware of her world at such a young age; she deserves a good life and happiness for her and her family; hopefully, she will go  far in bringing her country into the modern world.  A great mind!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game very addicted I get frustrated but cant stop playing some levels are easy while others are hard
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|After reading all of the other books by Preston and Child I, of course, had to read this one.  I found myself wanting to read one more chapter, but at the same time knowing that would bring me closer to the end.  This was a greatly written novel. Mi highly recommend it.
B001GJ3BR8|4.0|Are you tired of slow motion flips, and flip kicks to the face? Too bad, because this movie takes the flip kicking up a notch. Just when a fight gets going, and you start to think, \\"that's impossible for them to add a flip in this scene. It's downright impractical,\\" BAM! THEY FLIP THE S*** OUT OF YOU.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Going through cancer, being treated at Dana Farber it cuts close to my heart... There's times I have to put it down, but it reads like some kind of fascinating spy novel!!!!! Worth the read!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game. Love the lines. Love the pretty colors and the dots. Gets progressively harder at just the right rate of speed. Hopefully it will quit asking for a review. .  Seriously... it is a really good puzzle game
B000002MNL|5.0|This is one of Morrissey's best albums.  Of the eleven songs from the original track listing, I liked all but one or two.  It contains some songs that are quite melancholy but great, such as &#34;I Am Hated for Loving,&#34; but it also has some songs that are very uplifting like &#34;Now My Heart Is Full.&#34;  It's an emotional, Morrissey-operated roller coaster.
B001N09F7U|3.0|My decision to read the book was only because I thought the \\"enemy\\" would be something supernatural. It seems like no more than ten minutes passes when Trisha gets lost and decides not to backtrack. Come on! turn around, turn around. Non-baseball fans might feel like skipping over a few sections. This girl's bravery and tenacity won me over in the last innings. Being picky but in the hospital room, they're all shedding tears except for Dad?
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book is full of surprises. It makes you want to know the husband's secret so badly that you can't put it down.
B00BC254I8|5.0|Funny, explains a lot.  A little weird at the end like he is trying to be his on psychologist  .
0345803485|3.0|Put a more intense version of Mr Darcy into Du Maurier's Rebecca and you have the characters in fifty shades.<br />A powerful and clever combination that could have been a brilliant book,<br />Sadly it is badly written. It lacks a coherent plot and the dialog and sex is repetitive and boring.<br />I read all three books but I was skip reading by book two.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|Great stories with a bit of mystery and somewhere within all of that , some good humor to make it fun.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham brings the characters to life with his humor and down-to-earth story telling. I have already determined who should play the characters if a movie came out of it. Grisham continues to be my all time favorite author. Keep them coming!
B00DZPVS9O|5.0|These guys still know how to rock!  &#34;The Duke of Supernatural&#34; is the best rock song of 2013 ! They're touring now, check them out.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Wordy. Verbose. Did I mention wordy? I did not care for the writing style.  Topic was interesting and YA age appropriate.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is a great app It is worth downloading this. It record but it is much better cuz it's in hd yay this is awesome.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Well, everyone waited and waited for Candy Crush on Kindle - and it was worth the wait. I haven't run into any bugs or crashes; the gameplay is still as beautiful, cute and fun as ever.<br /><br />Here's the real reason I'm writing this review. When I played this game on Facebook, I'd get so frustrated at being REQUIRED to get my friends to &quot;help unlock the next level&quot; (and thus getting stuck for weeks at a time), I just ended up quitting. I don't know if this was an update included on Facebook, but in this app, you have the option to proceed WITHOUT bothering your friends - you can simply play a series of &quot;Mystery Challenges,&quot; i.e. going back to a previous level to reach a certain score, and the next region will unlock. (Note: I am not connected to Facebook at all through the app.)<br /><br />Excellent, flawless gameplay. I was even having so much fun, I got through those terrifying chocolate levels!
B0013F1D02|4.0|Great SiFi/fairy tale adventure--well written.--this is the second time I have seen it and liked it better than the 1st time when I saw it several years ago.  2 thumbs up !!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was suspenseful and thought provoking throughout.  I read very quickly to get to the ending.  Worth a read.  Would be good on a vacation.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This is the game I have been waiting for soooo long now it's here my only thing is will there be servers.
B0030MM68O|5.0|Very sentimental and emotional look at war. It's not your everyday war film, but more about the inner struggle of war against the turpitude and heinousness we all engage in.<br /><br />It's not about a villian and good guys, it's about the disgust of war.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I gave to my grandson and he loved it.  He is not allowed to watch CD's very often but when he does he picks the Toy Story CD.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|What an abomination. I would have hoped that Les Miserables would be ONE beloved production that Hollywood could not completely destroy. I stand corrected. The singing styles combined with the acting -- an obvious product of horrific direction -- were awkward at best. Anyone who claimed that Hugh Jackman or Russell Crowe could sing is deluded to the point of needing medication. And anyone who claimed Anne Hathaway turned-in an Oscar-worthy performance wouldn't know a good actor if he/she slapped them in the face.<br /><br />Basically what you have in this rendition of the beloved musical, is a clunky, cringe-inducing half-measure that the Hollywood moguls actually managed to buttress with their last bastion of imagination: special effects. That's correct. They actually managed to pack this turd of a film with CGI special effects. Funny how the Geoffrey Rush/Liam Neeson version relied on terrific acting and an honest interpretation of Victor Hugo's book rather than flimsy computer effects. This musical (if you want to actually call it that) couldn't even manage to contain itself and stay somewhat honest to the stage production's already emotion-packed, heart wrenching story.<br /><br />Mind you, I've seen Les Miserables on and off Broadway and I can attest that this latest version is a sour attempt that was then propagated as some award-worthy film by the Oscar-voting crowd. Consider this: if those distant, arrogant &#34;stars&#34; feel the need to &#34;lobby&#34; for a film to win awards, what does that say about the film itself?
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|cool but the scope needs do stop moving everywhere the scope needs to be in place<br />So they need a update.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Awesome film.  There really isn't romantic chemistry between the leads. And I think they could have casted a different lead. But overall the film is amazing. The suspense and tension is perfect. I can't wait till the sequel comes out in summer of 2014. Great blockbuster film for the family especially during the holidays.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|AWESOME!!! So glad there is now a App for the Kindle Fire now! It's so much of a better view.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It solved my charging problems due to using a different charger (not designed for the Kindle,) which failed to charge the unit.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham needs no introduction but his flawless writing is present here as ever.  As far as plot, again Grisham does not fail to absorb and mesmerize with a unique plot and endless intriguing twists.  A great book.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|AMD always has been my prefered brand for all my builds, as usual i'm happy with this purchase. You can't go wrong with this.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Great apocalyptic movie. Only 4stars because family story element not well fleshed out. Was not believable nor was his motivation. Bit contrived. Overall great effects and truly scary - fast zombies! I liked the fluid motion of the horde.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great story with a very touching ending.  Still up to Mr Grisham's great standards. Very interesting story taking the lawyer from an earlier book into a very exciting new story.
B00006674X|5.0|Among my favorite Elvis movies!  It actually has a good plot and not so dopey as some of the other films he made.  I enjoy watching very much.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun! It's very addicting though. There ARE in-app purchases, but you can easily play without them. I TOTALLY recommend this game to all ages!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game, it's very addictive. However I can not get my extra moves from friends to work, but I still enjoy playing.
B005SCSL56|4.0|Some. Chapters were very good and others not so much<br />I LOVE to read and would read it again but just be prepared for the boring chapter
0761169253|5.0|Easy to read, empathetic, ad simple. Points out really important factors. Eveyone should read it! I'm relieved that I am not missing out on this book any more :)
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Its a must get if you like paint based apps. It lets you create anything( i`v already made four cartoons).
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|I love reading Malcolm Gladwell and found The Tipping Point, Blink and Outliers to be masterpieces of creative thinking that challenged conventional wisdom. I was disappointed with his latest book, which attempts to make the case for the advantages of being the underdog. Of the several examples he gives to make his case, his most persuasive is his first, the girls basketball team with little talent that wins games against stronger opponents because of a change in defensive tactics. His least persuasive is his argument that class sizes in schools should be neither too large, nor too small. I couldn't see the connection between that argument and the David and Goliath analogy. That was just a swipe at the conventional wisdom that claims smaller is better when it comes to school classrooms. I was hoping he'd bring the examples together in a final chapter under the umbrella of an &#34;underdog theory,&#34; but the book turned out to be an entertainment, rather than an illumination, falling well short of Gladwell's previous books.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Best book I've read this year.  Will win National Book award.  Can't say enough about it.  I'm whacked out about it.  Donna Tartt is a true master.  Just read it.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Fabulous show:  intriguing storyline full of twists, well developed, engaging characters, and great acting!  I can't wait for Season 3!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|1. Aura - 4/5 I found this song a great way to open the Album, its sounds like a transition from Born This Way! I like the cultural<br />hooks and sounds in the song! I just dont like the beginning<br /><br />2. Venus - 5/5 This songs was and still is on repeat on my iPod, its a great futuristic song with a infectious Chorus!<br /><br />3. G.U.Y - 5/5 There are no words for this track, its sexual it has a catchy chorus, it has great beats etc 5/5!!<br /><br />4. Sexxx Dreams - 5/5 One of the best songs on ARTPOP, as i was listening to the album i could feel each and every adrenalin<br />Gaga was feeling, especially in Sexxx Dreams! Its a song that makes you get up and just do a lap dance to and to a person real or imaginary!<br /><br />5. Jewels n' Drugs - 2/5 This is my least favorite track off the album, tho it has some dancy beats, it just doesnt have an impact on me, i think its because i dont like Rap music :\<br /><br />6. MANiCURE - 3/5 I was a bit disappointed with this track because the iTunes Festival version was better, and the Studio Version isnt as powerful as the live version, dont get me wrong i love this song, but because it wasnt identical to the Live version, it kinda through me off.<br /><br />7. Do What U Want - 4/5 I have a &#34;Hate/Love&#34; relationship with this song. Its just taking a bit to grow on me.<br /><br />8. ARTPOP - 5/5 The title track is great and sounds futuristic like VENUS, i love the chorus, even though i gave this a 5/5 i liked the Live version better!<br /><br />9. Swine - 3/5 I LOVE SWINE, but again, the iTunes Festival version had a lot more than the Studio...<br /><br />10. Donatella - 4/5 One of my faves on the album, it makes me feel like im walking a RUNWAY!!!<br /><br />11. Fashion! - 3/5 Fashion is okay :\ thats about all i can say about this track<br /><br />12. Mary Jane Holland - 5/5 MY FAVORITE SONG OFF THE ALBUM...PERIOD!!<br /><br />13. Dope - 4/5 I have a &#34;LOVE/HATE&#34; relationship with this song as well, i have to be in the mood for it.<br /><br />14. Gypsy - 5/5 THIS SONG IS TIED WITH Mary Jane Holland, ITS MY FAVORITE OFF THE ALBUM!!<br /><br />15. Applause - 5/5 You cannot hate this song! Plain and Simple!!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I used to love the game but it started to lage . Then I started wandering if it would always do it . It has been going for three months . It. Is better for iPad and iPod .
B00F35B8F8|2.0|Very blurry picture during the action sequences due to buffering. I love the movie, but the picture was terrible and hard to see.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Awesome movie!!! Wasn't sure about it at first but couldn't stop watching !!!! It's definitely a must see!!! Had me on the edge of my seat!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game does a good job of balancing itself with being easy in concept and still remaining challenging. It does a good job of keeping my attention.
0316228583|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. If you enjoy British literature this is a must read. In most novels, the hero is all good and the villain is all bad. Rowling exposes the reality that there are devils and angels in all of us and celebrates our humanity in this wonderful novel.
0312430000|5.0|Not only does he make an outstanding case for checklists, he is a master story teller. Even if you are sure you disagree with him on his thesis, I promise you will enjoy the stories!<br /><br />His analysis near the end of the hero treatment given to Captain &#34;Sully&#34; Sullenberg (sp?) following the &#34;Miracle on the Hudson&#34; is a sobering assessment of our national mindset, yet still, it is more strong evidence for the effectiveness of checklists.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|this book had a great beginning but quickly slid down to disgustingly too much info about alcoholism and addiction with all the physical effects in gory detail.  the hero never redeems himself and in the end you don't care if he lives or dies.  way too long--I felt sucked into a morass and couldn't get out hoping it would get better.
B000000OQ5|5.0|Scorching hot album right out of the 80's.  I was raised in the central valley of California and these guys where the best of the best to come out of Sacramento.  For some unknown reason my daughter has taken a shine to 80's metal and this CD was high on my list of suggestions - she loved them as much as I did.
0321811984|5.0|This book was helpful in understanding the nuances of a presentation from start to finish.  Reynolds provides an adaptable approach to preparing presentations rather than a model that is set in stone and provides clarity in only a few situations.  Usually with this type of abstraction, I am left feeling like I have had a bunch of buzzwords thrown at me but nothing substantial was communicated.  This is not the case with “PresentationZen”.  Reynolds uses many examples that provide good explanation and clarity of the point being presented without becoming rigid with the application.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was a very good book.  The characters from A Time To Kill just pick up 3 years later.  There were no boring parts in the story at all
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Over all this is a great produce with all of its applications. (phone, kindle, computer and so on)...I have had a few problems on my phone with it not saving some of my books, but than again that could just be my phone.
B009949RKC|4.0|Seen this movie a couple of times since it's original release. Recommend it to anyone who has not seen it.
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|Big disappointment? You have to be kidding me!  Hey, straight to the DVD/Blu-ray these guys are incredible! If you don't like music especially the blues don't buy this DVD.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|this is a great movie. the action is good and the cg looks incredible. I would recommend this to everyone, even those who aren't in to star trek.
B00DJYKFXG|4.0|I'll admit I bought this for the surround mix on the DVD. In the back of my mind I was thinking this was a product for completists and people that are Band fanatics, which I am not. But listening it to all the way through I was convinced otherwise. This really is a seminal performance and recording--Little Feat and the Dead owe a debt of gratitude to these guys and this material.<br /><br />The surround mix is oriented to the front 3 speakers and is light in the sides, the sides having a mix of audience and horns. The surround is an &#34;audience&#34; mix--as if you were standing in the audience and hearing it live. It's a pricey set (why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars) but worthwhile. The Last Waltz does not go nearly as deep into the Band catlogue as this, as wonderful as it is. So if you want to hear the Band at the top of their game, look no further.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Honestly a waste of any money only 4 apps and that,s all you can cast from and not very child friendly with my daughters kindle and cant play you own videos that on network or pads the 4 apps come standard on most newer tv's or on cheap bluray players which would give you more functions i still recommend Roku or dare i say it Apple TV in fact most other blow it out of the water PS Amazon please make your own that works with your Kindles Parents and children would both love you lol
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Needs to be rethought... Works better on my iPhone 5s than Nexus 10?!?  Come on.  Give me screen mirroring, please!!! Runs crazy hot... they warn you, but it was still a but of a surprise just how hot.  It is SO hot they put a warning in the box to power it off before grabbing it to unplug.  How does a USB power 5v even have enough  power to gen that much heat.  I like the small size and the thoughtful addition of a HDMI extension cable...

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have heard so much hype about how great this series is and I finally decided to spend a few days catching up.  I was able to watch the first two seasons on Comcast xfinity and watched season 3 with Amazon.  Love, love this series.  Can't wait for season 4!  Thanks Amazon for carrying this series in your TV library.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Novel theme well paced - thoroughly enjoyed it. The characters were were sufficiently different, not plastic and I look forward to reading about them in future.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This is a great story on many levels.  As the story progresses we learn more and more about Alvin Strait and his history, which helps explain many things that we see early in the film.  Alvin did not have a perfect life, but as he realizes his days are numbered he decides to put things right with his estranged brother using his limited resources in unconventional ways.  As Alvin meets people on his journey we see his wit and his wisdom and each encounter provides another life lesson.<br /><br />For some reason, the director decided that this DVD should not have any chapter marks in it, which is inconvenient.<br /><br />If you have seen this show on television, be advised that the TV edit leaves out some scenes that provide some key details in the overall story.  Example, in the TV edit that I have seen, Alvin leaves town on a red lawn tractor and then he suddenly changes to a green John Deere tractor.  The DVD will show you why.

B00GI8AMI8|3.0|Interesting. Stuck with some seaweed and bicycle pedals. Have no idea where to go with that, so I took a break. I like games with a hint button, also. There isn't one with this game. I will go back to it once in a while, but with games of this type, I usually find it too frustrating to hang in there for any length of time. I don't think the way the makers of these games do, so I will probably move along. It does have a nice clear screen with plenty of light. Some games are very dark and hard on my eyes. So, I can say this one is done very well.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was not all as I expected it to be from media comments or other reviews. Definitely a good read that left me intrigued at ever page turn. I was captured from the beginning. I appreciate the tasteful display of that world..........Onward to next one!!!

007174889X|4.0|The Bible for Internal Medicine, I like it, it has a lot of details and very well developed information.... Sometimes a bit too much if you are in a hurry looking for an specific subject. That's why you get the pocket version. But awesome if you're one of those who enjoys chilling put reading meds, definitely a must have.<br />I'd say that the General Practice from Murtagh is a bit more friendly and didactic version (specially for GP's in Kiwiland or Oz)

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|After a couple months, I'm really really bored.  No games, no showing my pictures or videos, ugh.<br />It's basically a Netflix and Youtube player.  Yes, I know it can also share your chrome browser, but that is laggy and lame.<br /><br />Thanks google, you fooled me again into buying another beta product with no future.
B00CRGZMUI|2.0|I did not like this book at all; I found it boring and could easily anticipate what was coming next.  Having said that, perhaps it could be quite funny when acted out in a movie as her last books were.  wait for the movie!

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have the Kindle app installed on my Note 2 and I absolutely love it. It's quick and easy access to my favorite reads and they come in vibrant and clear, with a ton of options available to me (highlighting, dictionary look up, sharing text, and a ton of other things). I have a Nook Color e-reader as well, but I can't access many of the titles available on Amazon on it. I don't have the desire (or tech savvy) to root my Nook to run droid, so having Kindle on my phone allows me to easily access those titles I want. Great app.
0316055433|5.0|Astounding comprehension of the human heart from all walks of life. A vision, a philosophy, and a very very rare thing these days - understanding.

B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I discovered the FitBit a while back and was really interested in it so I was really excited when I got the chance to try out the Withings which seems somewhat similar.<br /><br />The battery life on this is amazing. It lasts a while before it needs a recharge. Although, the charging cable it comes with is extremely short, but at least it uses the same basic plug that most androids use so I have a few lying around.<br /><br />I have a love/hate relationship with the size of the device. It is very small and fits nicely in pretty much any pocket. It's also nice that when you wear it on the wristband to sleep, it is not bulky and annoying. My problem with this is that I tend to loose things very easily and I have misplaced my Withings more than once. A feature I would love to see added would be some sort of locator button that you can press on your phone to make the device beep or something along those lines.<br /><br />In the beginning I was having some issues with my data uploading to my phone. I would turn on the bluetooth and nothing would happen, or only half of my data would transfer. Since there have been a few updates to the app, I haven't had this problem, although it does take a little bit of time from when I turn on my bluetooth to when the information transfers (about 5 minutes or so).<br /><br />I love that my phone keeps track of all the information and I can look at a graph to easily see my progress. I'm a visual person and I love graphs, so I love this feature.<br /><br />The sleep monitoring is really interesting to me. I love knowing how much sleep and the quality of sleep I'm actually getting every night.<br /><br />I have a lot of trouble with the heart rate monitor. I don't know if it's the sensor or if my finger is too small or what, but I have a really hard time trying to get the Withings to read my heart rate and I usually just give up trying.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love Sophie Kinsella's sense of humour that is conveyed in the main character Poppy. A great book to take on vacation. &#34;I've Got Your Number&#34; provides that light entertainment that had me engrossed from beginning to end. &#34;Wedding Night&#34; is going to Bali with me this weekend. Just perfect for a weeks relaxing sabbatical when you want to smile and laugh as you take in Bali's sunshine. Thank you Sophie.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie will keep you guessing. As soon as you think you know what's going on, you don't.<br /><br />A movie well written and extremely well acted. --Bravo!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't know why I resisted reading this book so long. This is one of the best works of fiction I have read in a long time. The characters come alive as you go along. You feel like you can connect with their feelings. Amazing read, cannot wait to read the final 2.

1623650003|5.0|LOVED it .... and highly recommend it - so many twists and turns which for an avid reader of suspence/detective novels is rare.  Can´t wait for his next book to be translated into English.
B00CATSONE|3.0|This book isn't what it seems to be.  I thought it might be a biography of Tesla.  It certainly contains a short biography of Tesla.  But the reason the book was written was for the author to present his theory of why some people are regarded as geniuses.  From there he hopes you will buy his self help books.  It wasn't pushy or offensive, and the biography of Tesla was interesting.  It was free and worth every penny.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|For me it reached and touched both the expansion of love and it's depth. In the end we don't choose who we love. We just love them and learn to not only accept their differences but enjoy them.

The book is very interesting and informative.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have tried many mice, but none have ever been shaped so perfectly for the hand as this one. My hand simply falls perfectly into place. This mouse has spoiled me in such a way that i cannot use my other gaming mouses because their grips irritate me. You can easily customize DPI, acceleration, light color, and even the weight of the mouse to your preferred settings. This mouse is the total package and i am completely satisfied with my purchase.
1567184855|5.0|For me this book was more validation of the immortality of the soul and the spirit realm.  It's just silly to think that something as magnificent and complex as the &#34;I&#34; or &#34;we&#34; just appears out of, and returns to nothingness.  The cases in this book can't be made up.  It's a fascinating read and really helps put this thing we call &#34;life&#34; in a rational perspective.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I have read all of the Pendergast novels but this had to be the best yet!! Interesting  it's a story that could easily happen. Very rich town that develops multi million dollar homes only to find they were built on old mines with mercury contamination. A GREAT SUSPENSE STORY!!

B00BB67UNW|5.0|Both actors in this movie are excellent actors and when I purchase 1 movie that is good I usually end up buying a few more.
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|Great, fun movie but the 3D conversion is okay, not spellbinding. None of the Marvel 3D conversions have been that impressive, at least not yet. It is my hope that they start filming in 3D, rather than up-converting from 2D.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is another town builder, gated by time and gold. The fluff and lengths this game goes through to mask that is pretty well done, though. I gave it 4 stars for now, but it doesn't touch my favorite of the genre, Happy Street.
B008JFUP0I|3.0|The fast n furious series has hit a all time low. They went from trying to put on good streat races to trying to give you big stars with hollywood chases from the popo. It took a left turn when they added rock, that's when it really went tooooo hollywood. Ok let me stop blablering about the series and get to this movie.<br /><br />This one only had about 2 wow moments, the freaking 15 mile runway strip(not) with the car holding the plane down(blabla) and the tank on the road keeping up with fast muscle cars? ummmm yeah. See it's moments like that that make you go this isn't realistic they're just going for brownie points on trying to have those wow moments that everyone talks about. like how you're going to land inside another car once a tank flips over and throws you out. So i gave this move a 3 because they focused on wow moments instead of giving you those high speed drag races.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Overall a good read, who knew a circle could be so scary. I always thought it was the squares one needed to worry about... Oh shape jokes. I enjoyed this book but felt like it lost it's pacing halfway through, then picked up at the 3/4's mark and wrapped up rather quickly. Feel like a follow up book is a must.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|the most addictive game ever. millions of dollars are spent to buy new levels for $.99. best game ever made!
B00EXVZW6E|2.0|it was fun for 5 mins then after that it was just meh. thing is the items are well hidden.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|I love my Plantronics Voyager Legend bluetooth. I previously had a jawbone which is supposed to be top rated but mine broke and after the second time replacing it I gave up and bought the Voyager Legend. When I call people they don't even know I'm on the bluetooth. The ear device is a bit clunky but I'll take clunky and working over a jawbone any day. I also bought the charger case and I'm glad I did. I keep the earpiece in the charger case in my purse and have never had a problem. The only bad thing I can say and why I did not give it 5 stars is when I walk outside people can hear the wind but other than that I would totally recommend the Voyager if you are in the market for a bluetooth and stay away from the jawbone.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Stephen King brings these things upon himself.<br /><br />It isn't fair to compare his latest novel, Doctor Sleep, with his landmark work, The Shining. But comparisons are inevitable -- Doctor Sleep is a sequel to The Shining.<br /><br />Critics will rightfully say, \\"Doctor Sleep is okay, but it isn't as good as The Shining.\\" But how could it be? The Shining is a classic (its status doubly bolstered by Stanley's Kubrick's equally iconic film adaptation.) The Shining has enjoyed four decades of popularity, accolades, and analysis. Fanboys like me grew up with The Shining as a culture touchstone, a literary benchmark against which all other horror novels were judged.<br /><br />So King is practically begging for bad reviews for Doctor Sleep. It's impossible to fill The Shining's big shoes. Fortunately, King doesn't even try, allowing Doctor Sleep to take its own path into new literary territories.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep finds Danny Torrance all grown up, and suffering from the same alcoholism that plagued his father. It's a subject King seems to know intimately, and the novel's most authentic moments unfold when Danny Torrance views the world through a 12-stepper's hardened-yet-knowing gaze.<br /><br />There are plenty of fumbles in Doctor Sleep. Female hero Abra is inconsistent; wise beyond her years one moment, and inexplicably innocent the next. There's a family revelation late in the novel that's hollow and cringe inducing, along with several Freaky Friday -style body swaps that are equally douche-chilly.<br /><br />That doesn't mean Doctor Sleep is a bad novel, or an unsatisfying read. It's nice seeing Danny shine again. Tony reprises his role as psychic messenger, and there are sweet cameos by Dick Hallorann, and the ghoulish ghost from Room 217.  Doctor Sleep is well paced, Rose The Hat is a badass villain, and everything wraps up neatly enough.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is okay, but it isn't as good as The Shining.<br />-30-the novel’s most authentic moments unfold when Danny Torrance views the world through a 12-stepper’s hardened-yet-knowing gaze.<br /><br />There are plenty of fumbles in <i>Doctor Sleep</i>.

B005EHQGTS|2.0|you got so many versions. Desktop,business,regular casual version. Look the main thing people wanna use this app for is to stream while you're at work on your cellphone. I got this as a free app of the day for android and it doesn't work but it works under wifi at home. So this app isn't casual user friendly, its one of those apps where you have to figure out all the specs of your router, make sure you have a good cellphone signal, make sure you don't have auto-time out enabled like crap. so no this app sucks. I wish there was a app where you put in your ip address and you're good with a username and password

1476729085|4.0|It was a dark and stormy night....our power went out on Sunday night - reports indicated that it would be out for most of the night. Rather than digging around for a flashlight, I realized I could use the handy dandy flashlight app on my iPad - and that I could easily hunker down and read in the dark. (Others in the house were moaning about televisions and PlayStations)<br /><br />Well, I read until the iPad ran out of juice. (I didn't have a full charge when I started) Do you ever start a novel and realize you're in for a fantastic read within the first few pages? Graeme Simsion's debut novel, The Rosie Project, was one of those books.<br /><br />Genetics Professor Don Tillman leads his life by a strict schedule, strict rules and rigidly adheres to them. He's brilliant, but socially inept, unable to read facial clues or experience emotion. He's had a few first dates (very few) but never a second one. Nearing his fortieth birthday, he decides he needs to find a mate. But how to do that without wasting time? Aha!<br /><br />&#34;A questionnaire! Such an obvious solution. A purpose-built, scientifically valid instrument incorporating current best practice to filter out the time wasters, the disorganized, the ice-cream discriminators, the visual-harassment complainers, the crystal gazers, the horoscope readers, the fashion obsessives, the religious fanatics, the vegans, the sports watchers the creationists, the smokers, the scientifically illiterate, the homeopaths, leaving, ideally, the perfect partner, or realistically, a managed short list of candidates.&#34;<br /><br />And The Wife Project is born. And then Rosie Jarman walks into Don's office. Don thinks she is thee to apply for The Wife Project, but  Rosie is looking for a geneticist to help her find her biological father.  Rosie is everything Don is NOT looking for in a mate. But he's intrigued by her search. And so, The Father Project is born. And maybe, just maybe, Rosie is a little intriguing as well...<br /><br />I loved Don and his view of the world. His scheduling, his routines, his reaction to the rest of the world - and theirs to him. Simsion manipulates the reader wonderfully. I became so invested in Don and his search and his burgeoning self awareness. I empathized, I laughed, I cheered. The supporting cast of married couple Gene and Claudia were just as well drawn. It was interesting to see their story revealed through Don's eyes.<br /><br />Don tells the whole story and Simsion never breaks character. It was truly eye opening to see the world through  a 'different' set of eyes.<br /><br />The Rosie Project was absolutely wonderful and beguiling and just a really, good heartwarming, read. Think The Curious Incident of the Dog in The Night-Time meets The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry.<br /><br />Sony Pictures has optioned film rights to The Rosie Project and Simsion is working on a sequel.<br />I loved Don and his view of the world.

B00E9O6C96|3.0|Let's be honest. The product has an execellent DAC and render a very good sound. However the software totally sucks.<br /><br />No playlist management, no sorting, no album per artist choice... You can browse by artist, by gender or by album, and that's it. If you select artists, you can find the artist you want, and then, you get all the tracks from this artist. No album hierarchy.<br /><br />Also, the tracks are not automatically sorted by track number and you cannot choose to.<br /><br />The Favorite option is just a joke ! It's a folder. if you want favorites, you have to put them in the appropriate folder ... Come on..<br /><br />Price is good, sound is good because dac is good, but really, the software is a joke and should be totally remade for something usable.
B008JFUR10|1.0|i first seen this trailer back earlier this year when it was released and i was like ha a freaking transformers wanna be in the ocean. then i got a girlfriend and we both fell in love with watching movies a lot, mainly the so called blockbuster like movies. so i actually skipped this movie because i thought the guy from iron man 2/3  that wore the blue ironman suit whatever his name was was the main character in this movie lol but no so I started watching it 30 mins in the movie i'm like ummmmmm when is he going to show up? my GF is like he's not in this movie so I'm like oh i could of sworn in the trailers that was him. So I was like well maybe this will be a good movie than.......WRONG! freaking the movie failed to give you the blockbuster fights you wanted to see, instead you get idiots go out in the water with they plastic suits and get torn to part one by one. Like you mean to tell me no one has a suit that can deliver the goods to these fruity monsters. Then the whole 2 people bringing their brains together to control the gaint robots? really that concept is stupid. I can't stress on how the plot is boring and the fights are let down. Sure the monsters where tough but far as the guys in the suits controlling the robots NO.  a 1 out of 5

B001992NUQ|5.0|&#34;We are a generation of men being raised by women. I don't think that is a good thing.&#34; As a parent of a young man, I have watched my son struggle to develop his strengths and his passions. At 22, he is still struggling to find that mysterious balance that is required for a boy to become a man. When he was 13, I watched him struggle to know if it is better to pee standing up or sitting down. I knew I had to do something. I told him he could watch this movie with me if he promised not to tell his mother. A son will always make that deal with his father, by the way. The difficulty of raising a son or being a son in the modern world is displayed brilliantly. The alter ego creation seems to be a sensible solution. I'm sending a copy to a single mom friend who has two sons with hard questions for her about what life is for and why I am alive.<br /><br />Fight Club shows the struggle. For all of you who think that this is some kind of pornographic tripe, you haven't yet hit the wall where the simple black and white answers stop working for you (or for your son). The two characters in this story are the same man pursuing very different paths to discovering his real self identity. Neither works. In the end, he needs both characters blended into one capable man.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Simply Love Ken Follett!!  Can not wait for the next book.  He tells history in a fantastic manner that just makes you want to continue reading and learning.  The books are long and large but so very worth it!!  Waiting not so patiently for the next one!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|it messes up quite abit and caused me to have to restart which is sad cause all my hard work. please fix it so that the game doesn't freeze up and cause problems that make you have to restart all over again.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Storyline and characters stayed true to the original series and further developed each of the main characters. Great cgi and effects. Also true to the original, the science is marginally believable, but that's why they call it science &#34;fiction&#34; :)
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this game is totally awesome! i got this game thinking it wouldnt be that good but it is totally awesome! nobody should second guess themselves about buying this game cause it is awesome. buy this game.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is great for a small pocket knife, compact design allows even the smallest pocket knives to be easily sharpened.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|One of my personal favourite version of  Persuasion . I think Rupert Penry -jones was absolutely perfect in this role. Sally Hawkins was very believable in her role too . Very enjoyable but I must say the the main characters did it for me.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It is a fun way to pass the time, but does use a lot of battery power. I can't stay away.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I got this for my niece. She loves it. We even made her a leafman type costume for Halloween. I even play it, you know,  just to help out.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|That's all I got.  What author does that?  I'm not a spoiler so I won't go into detail...just saying..  Wtf.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great follow up to A Time To Kill!  Jake is perfect and can't help but fall in love a little with Lucien...
B00280LYIM|5.0|The Battle of the Labyrinth was just as awesome as all of the other Percy Jackson series.Fun,full of action,and just great.Good job,Riordan!
B00F1W1SQW|4.0|I love this band and the new lineup, DTOE was awesome, timeless and classic, and the songs are even better live. The performance is legendary, and the DVD captures it honestly. Somehow I've waited a long time for this to come out and it kind of missed the mark. First of all, I hope the DVD/Blue Ray/CD/Vinyl/T-shirt $100 bundle craze GOES AWAY SOON (I have a bigger beef with Black Sabbath). Put out the standard crap and let us buy the same thing over and over again in different media formats (we will). No separate cd and no I-Tunes as I write this. Secondly the inherent sound problems with the mike totally ruin the acoustic set for me. Third no songs from Train of Thought whatsoever, criminal since that was the one that got my wallet involved. My last gripe is the bonus performances, songs which should have been in the main show (yes it's true they didn't play Pull Me Under in Chicago and now that I've heard it Mangini-style I'm even more pissed). The documentary is cool, it's a long show, and it's really the marketing that I have an issue with. Now I'll go listen to their new studio cd, Moving Pictures.
B004I744AS|5.0|I've tried other dictionary apps and this is by far the best. I like the fact that it keeps a history of previous words that I have looked up. And the thesaurus feature is an excellent addition.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|&#34;So&#34; John Grisham.  Had a hard time shutting down my Kindle til the end.  I knew everything would work out in the end.  And the ending was worth waiting for.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Epic space adventure. Drama, comedy and everything you imagine to make you wish this series would come back right now.
B008JEJN8O|5.0|Excellent shoes. I was afraid that the size wouldn't match my feet but it was perfect. The croc itself is too roomie but is the essence of that model. Colors are the same as the picture and the delivery time was also great.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I have read. Couldn't put it down, read in a day. It was funny and Heartbreaking. Highly recommended.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|The book was amazing. Yes it was occasionally repetitive with the way Oliver describes things, but she describes them very to the point and also beautifully. I wish I could have known who she ends up with in the whole love triangle, I believe though she was hinting Alex (whom I want her to be with anyways and in my mind she is and always was.) Yet overall this very well could be the best series I have read. I love love LOVE the way all of the characters grow and change and grow and change again. And honestly I could rant on and on about this book so why don't you just read it already.
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|Great for searching as it shows theitems nice and big and clear( unlike many other store apps which distort the items or show them so small that I can't see them).  Easy to navigate.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Loved it till it won't connect to server ever again. No fun when you can't play. Oh well I guess. Consider it deleted.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I LOVE this it is worth the money it works great and you can pick the music you want to wake up to its amazing I recommend this app.
B00D8RYV52|5.0|My grandson, just turned 4 yrs, absolutely loves this!  His older sister, 6, also has a lot of fun with it.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Wow! What a twister - there is no picking this plot. Really enjoyed the style of writing and look forward to reading other titles by Gillian Flynn.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read all three of these and can't wait for the movies to come out I'm going to read this one again!
0307586901|5.0|Enjoy working on crafts with family I dont understand why saying you simply like and enjoy something isnt enough. so here are a bunch of extra words and i will never rate anything again
1250006341|5.0|This book is absolutely incredible and beautiful. There are so many of us in my book club that enjoys this series so now I am fixing to order books for the women for Christmas.
0142196940|5.0|An intimate look into John Taylor's life and those closest to him. Made me really see him for the true talent he is, not just an object to be desired. I have loved John Taylor and Duran Duran for over 30 years and this book makes me appreciate them all the more.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|**Spoilers**<br /><br />Um...what?<br /><br />There are so many different ways I saw this ending. Then came the ending. I understand the logic behind it, the selflessness of it all. But, in my selfishness it's tough to accept the loss of your heroine and I'm not as in love with this series as when it began. As frustrating as it is to loose one of my favorite characters it's even more infuriating when your rough and tough bad boy ends his run in the story as a politician.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I so love this game!!! My favs of all games!!! And I'm finally happy they got it for my kindle fire!!!! So happy about tht!!! My girls love this game as well and are addicts like their mommy... Proud momma!! *:)
034580404X|5.0|I've read the series before ordering it. I'm just glad I have the set all to myself to read as often as I'd like
B00BT70J0Y|5.0|Now that Amazon has begun collecting tax for Wisconsin I will look for any other possibility to purchase elsewhere than Amazon which I have been a good customer of for a long time. I guess it is time to buy a Google e-reader. Internet sales should not have a tax. Sorry Amazon but I will not pay tax to Wisconsin so it can be given to corrupt business partners of the Govenor while he kicks needy families off Medicare for their Children due to his Tea Party alliance.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|If one can look past the fantastic but expected high octane energy that defined James Bond movies, I believe that Daniel Craig's performance in this ittiration shows us for the first time, the human side of 007. I found this quite refreshing.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked this book a lot and its interconnecting story lines. I didn't want to put it down at times.
0156029065|2.0|What's Eco's problem? The Name of the Rose is great, Foucault's Pendulum is good, everything else is  just overwrought chintz.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|This was a good movie, due to the dual actors Will Smith and his son Jaden Smith. I liked the way the story played out.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I really liked this game and was hooked right away!  I especially liked that if you use a hint and it points out which direction to go you don't lose a hint.  This game holds your attention but I kind of thought the end was a bit anticlimactic and I felt kind of like &quot;that's it?&quot;  I still gave it 5 stars as I just had the best time playing. I may replay to see if I did something to make the ending leave me feeling a bit disappointed!  I bought the full Collector&acute;s version and I'm glad I did!!
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a classic tale about mismatched people finding love after many twists and turns in their relationship. I love it!
0307592731|5.0|Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail has been one of my favorite reads of the year.  I have read it twice and my copy is filled with highlights and comments in the margin.  I have recommended it to many. Cheryl Strayed is a brilliant writer and draws the reader into her emotional issues without making one feel that she is just saying &#34;poor, poor me&#34;.  Better yet, by the end of the book the reader feels certain that she has learned to survive anything that life throws her way. My copy still sits by my chair for quick reads. I am looking forward to reading more by Cheryl Strayed.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I would love to rate it for Amazon customers, but for some unknown reason, it did not download to my Kindle Fire...
B00005YUPO|5.0|My autistic grandson loves these video because he loves classical music.  He's 10 and we are on the 2nd disc because he wears them out.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game but it doesn't give me updates as much as I want.  The last update was over a month ago when is the next update?
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Just gets better and better.  SwiftKey keeps it fresh and continues to amaze.  Keep up the great work. I love the resize feature.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|It's a pretty good game once you start playing all you can think of is winning the next fight an addicting game really recommend it.
B00ERP55NQ|5.0|Easy to use and accurate. Also, it's kind of cool in that creepy &#34;big brother is watching&#34; kind of way, to zoom in on your own house.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|Quentin is tossed into a night of adventure when Margo comes through his window. After this liberating night of tricks, Margo runs away leaving Quentin with questions and a mystery. Any fan of John Green will love this book. It is funny, a great mystery, and has a little romance. The bigger and broader questions of life are woven into the story nicely. I think it needed a bit more romance in the plot.<br />BOTTOM LINE: The book has a little something for everyone. It is funny, mysterious, romantic, and philosophical at times. I recommend it to any young-adult.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|VERY ADDICTIVE! This is really a fun game and the levels get harder and more complicated.  It is fun! Yes!
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|It's the most exciting book and also an exciting series with lots of detail and lots of moments with interesting climaxes.
B004DBU0UW|5.0|George C Scott received an Academy Award for his performance (which he refused). I read several bios on Patton, and this movie gives you a glimpse of one of America's greatest military leaders.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game but i really need it to upgrade because i don't want to pay 20 dollars on the pc version
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|Added big movie stars didn't help, but hurt this movie. Original characters from the 1st are either gone, or only make brief appearance. Action is good, but the continuing story from the 1st is degraded by unknown characters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game will ruin your life!!! It is so addictive that you will go through candy crush withdrawals, as my friends and I say, when you go for a while without playing. BEWARE!
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I always love to hear what the critics of movies say, because I usually have the opposite view of a movie. Yes Will Smith has a small part in the movie, but the movie isn't about his character so he should have a smaller role. Jaden Smith puts in a great performance, and will probably rival his father as he matures.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|While the commercial airline industry has very strict &#34;random testing&#34; for flight crews and I can't imagine how someone would slip through the cracks, the  movie is entertaining, the performance great, and it's worth watching.
B003VW54QO|5.0|What can be added to this classic John Wayne movie (even though he did a remake of it). Must own for any true John Wayne fans.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Just got it and tried it out. Charges my iPad 3 and iPhone simultaneously and while in use and that's what I wanted it for. The larger Retina iPads won't charge with a standard USB adapter but this one has the juice.<br /><br />1/2 star off for no little LED light to let you know it's working, and a nearly impossible to see mark indicating which USB port is which. I immediately put two labels on it to show the amperage of each port.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|As always Robert Downey Jr. turns in a good performance and the action is great. For true Iron Man comic fans the story goes away from the comics. So those who haven't read the comics its great, for those who did as a child (I did), you have to forget the original.
0812973992|3.0|In August 1974, Philippe Petit walked out on a tightrope stretched across the gulf between the twin towers of the World Trade Center, still under construction. Back in the days before 24-hour cable \\"news\\" channels, that's the kind of item that would have capped the networks' nightly news broadcasts. I can picture my dad watching and shaking his head and muttering at the screen, \\"Jackass.\\" And that's a valid reaction. Petit is a jackass. Not only that, he's a French jackass. But sometimes, novelist Colum McCann argues, the world needs a jackass. In \\"Let the Great World Spin,\\" 2009's National Book Award winner, Petit plays holy fool in the lives of a handful of people -- a support group for mothers mourning sons lost in Vietnam, a pair of Scott-n-Zelda-wannabe artists, an aspiring photographer, a judge hoping to handle Petit's arraignment, a whore or two and even a gang of California hackers on the ARPANET(!). They all derive some kind of personal meaning from \\"le coup\\" pulled off by Petit that summer.<br /><br />McCann telegraphs early that he's not afraid to embrace sentimentality: \\"It is not fashionable anymore, I suppose, to have a regard for one's mother in the way my brother and I had then ... but the truth is we enjoyed each other, all three of us, and never so evidently as those Sundays when the rain fell gray over Dublin Bay and the squalls blew fresh against the windowpane.\\" That's a little gooey, but maybe it just strikes me that way coz of all the Sundays my brother and I used to spend in the cellar ferally fighting over scraps of beef jerky while Ma was in the kitchen upstairs gettin likkered up. Hhhhhh, sorry, I get a little weepy thinking back on those days.<br /><br />McCann kicks off the story with a serious miscalculation that almost scuttles the novel. The first 70 pages -- a segment titled \\"All Respects to Heaven, I Like It Here,\\" about a hippie Irish priest and his stable of hookers -- read like a novella written at the beginning of McCann's career, then tucked away in a drawer after multiple rejections, then resurrected and recycled and raggedly grafted on to the front of \\"Great World.\\" McCann has been a published novelist for more than a decade, yet this piece of writing is rife with rookie blunders, unintentional silliness and borderline-racist caricatures, culminating in a mawkish monologue that goes on unbroken for five or six pages. How did this get a National Book Award? I began to wonder if this was the literary equivalent of \\"Crash\\" winning the Oscar (though \\"Great World\\" isn't that bad). Aside from a couple of amateurish relapses, the writing does get better after that initial segment, but the book continues to frustrate because every time the story starts to work, McCann has to get cute, dropping ba-dum-bump would-be-witty one-liners such as \\"Another day, another dolor.\\" How did he get away with \\"she was a woman who had known the worst of times and best of times\\"? Or take this passage:<br /><br />\\"Oh, the day Joshua first shaved! Oh, the day! Covered himself in foam. So very careful with the razor. Made an avenue through the cheek, but nicked himself on the neck. Tore off a tiny piece of his Daddy's Wall Street Journal. Licked it and pasted it to the wound. The business page clotting his blood. Walked around with the paper on his neck for an hour. He had to wet it to get it off. She had stood at the bathroom door, smiling. My big tall boy, shaving. Long ago, long ago. The simple things come back to us. They rest for a moment by our ribcages then suddenly reach in and twist our hearts a notch backward.<br /><br />\\"No newspapers big enough to paste him back together in Saigon.\\"<br /><br />It's a nicely detailed snapshot scene of a mother remembering her son. Then that last line lands with a thud, jarring you out of the story so you notice the director behind the curtain, trying to draw your attention in a manic tapdance, waving his arms and yelling, \\"Didja see that? Didja see what I just did there?!!\\" It's that artificiality and authorial unwillingness to step aside and let the story unfold naturally that hold \\"Great World\\" back from success. It's all a little too pat, a little too stage-managed, every story element engineered for maximum dramatic effect. Even the scuzziest aspects of New York seem like set dressing. \\"That's how it is in the life, word.\\" No. I'm pretty certain that it's not. McCann is manipulative, but he manages to do it without being calculating, which is a skill not unworthy of respect. Dickens made a career of it. Ron Howard is a sappy filmmaker, but I can't help but like him. He's Opie. He's Richie Cunningham. Who the hell else is he gonna be? \\"Great World\\" has a lot in common with Howard's movies: There are sassy whores like in \\"Night Shift.\\" There are feisty oldsters like in \\"Cocoon.\\" There are colorful Irish immigrants like in \\"Far and Away.\\" Someone needs to get Ron Howard a copy of this book.<br /><br />Of course, McCann knows the emotional baggage the World Trade Center carries for most of us (Does anyone else get a twinge in the chest when older movies show the towers in place on New York's skyline?). He includes a photo (undoctored, I assume) of Petit's tightrope walk in which a jet flies overhead, seemingly scant feet away from one of the towers. He wants us to contrast the \\"artistic crime of the 20th century\\" to the monstrous crime against humanity that opened the 21st; a moment of sublime silliness juxtaposed with an act of rabid savagery. And in case anyone didn't get that, he appends a lugubrious final chapter set in 2006 that spells it all out explicitly for the slower readers. McCann mourns a country that's become stern and unyielding in its sadness. A scarred nation under draconian liquid bans where right-thinking liberals can't even make innocent jokes in airport checkpoint lines without being hauled off by humorless, snarling TSA thugs for flogging and cavity searches in a dungeon somewhere. But he sees glimmers of hopein a few New Yorkers' acts of kindness and in the Dawning of the Golden Age of Obama (did I miss something?). It's a sermon that's overstated and exaggerated like everything else in this crazily uneven novel. And in case someone still doesn't get the drift, McCann adds an Author's Note at the end to explain it all over again. And just in case there are STILL a couple of dudes scratching their heads in the back row of the special class, McCann stages an interview with his writer buddy Nathan Englander, so Englander can ask him, \\"So, Colum, what's it all about?\\" \\"Why, Nathan, I'm so glad you happened to ask me that...\\"<br /><br />Early on in \\"Great World,\\" McCann states what might as well be the book's moral: \\"He said he'd rather die with his heart on his sleeve than end up another cynic.\\" I think I'd rather hang out with Dad and shake my head and mutter, \\"Jackass.\\"
B00ECLU346|3.0|As always, sequels of sequels don't always live up to the original. Focusing on a sub character doesn't always make a good story.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved loved loved it.  Hooked me instantly and kept me hooked the entire time.  Will definitely be one that is read again and again.
B001TH44VY|5.0|Big fan of the movie theater version of this movie, so the Director's Cut adds more of the story that should have been in to begin with.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|I had to return the first one I received of this because it leaked.  I decided to try again with a replacement, and this pool was the highlight of my toddler's summer.  It was easy to inflate and he never got tired of coming down the little slide!  He was 18-22 months during the summer months, and I think it may be too small next summer, but we'll see.
B009GEPPYC|4.0|For a musical movie that had several singers (none of which from the 80's) its very good. Some casting problems, but the movie as a whole is very good. The extended version adds several scenes that should have been in the movie theater version.
140006922X|4.0|I still don't think it's 100% accurate but there are many interesting viewpoints.If Joseph & Mary had to go to Bethlehem to register for Roman taxes they would have been required to bring ALL their worldly property with them. How else would the Romans know what to tax. Makes more sense that the tax collector would have come to them to see what they have. Also, there's no known record of a Roman census at this time..
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Extended editions always give you more of what is needed in story telling. The few added scenes add more to the movie, and should make the experience more enjoyable.
0385350864|4.0|After nearly fifteen years, and a lot of life experience, Bridget Jones is back. This time, she’s single, has two little kids, Billy and Mabel and by now you know Colin Firth, I mean Mr. Darcy has passed. Her old pals are still in the picture, as is a lot of vodka flowing and repeated attempts to getting shagged. Nothing new there, only their ages have changed.<br /><br />Technology has the upper-hand, there’s the TV, DVD, remotes, buttons and forget memorizing passwords. Thank God she has children under five to run her household. Bridget discovers the new online dating landscape after sex and drunken Twitter over-sharing. She finds herself a power player working on a script that’s location changes daily between Hawaii and Norway. Ultimately she finds romance, but will it last? When in need of a babysitter there’s always Daniel Cleaver. That would be the Hugh Grant character in the film Jones! Always fun to dust him off and parade him out for a cameo.<br /><br />What I loved most of all about Helen Fielding’s latest Bridget Jones’ novel is that many of the reviews I read prior to reading the novel seemed to question what could be so fun about this book? Bridget has entered middle age, my God she’s 51, what can possible be fun in her fifties and forward? Well, Fielding takes on middle age in a more clever, humorously, snappily way and delivers it in another well-written can’t put it down page turner.<br /><br />HELLO! That’s my future as a woman, all of ours, and rather than fearing it or putting my head in the sand I’m embracing the future and taking it on like BRIDGET. She’s engaging in life! That’s what I love about the wild smart spirit of BRIDGET JONES! I hope Helen writes another novel with her on a cruise, eventually using a walker in fab designer fashions. We gals are only not old getting older, but I for one am getting feistier and more fantabulous!
B00FEN1C50|3.0|Good action adventure movie. More of the rockem sockem robot types, reminds me of the movie &#34;Robot Jox&#34;. Not really a whole lot in the story line, just giant robots battling invading monsters. Kind of like MechaGodzilla.
031623480X|5.0|Well resourced scientific information presented by a doctor who works in this area and knows what he's talking about.<br /><br />Kills a number of sacred cows currently worshipped by the mainstream medical establishment and pharma companies, e.g the cholesterol/heart disease myth, the pernicious effect of glutens and sugar on the brain with particular reference to Alzheimers Disease, dangers of statin drugs and practical nutritional support that any citizen can employ - drug free - to elude neurodegenerative disease.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love the game, very  addicting we could not stop playing.  Would recommend it for anyone who likes to play matching games.
0440246210|5.0|John Grisham consistently does quality writing. Ford County was that and more! I felt everything the characters felt as if I was the character myself. I laughed a LOT and cried with each one.<br />I believe that each of these short stories would make excellent 500+ page books themselves.<br />John Grisham does it even better. Get the book. You won't be sorry!
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie. When I began to watch it and saw that it would be another &#34;origin&#34; film I had even more doubts. After watching the film however I have to say that this is my favorite Superman and I hope they make some more with this cast. The man of steel was awesome from his incredible physique to his soft spoken manner. The special effects were great and the overall feel to the film was nice. If I had one complaint it would be that the final fight scene seemed to drag on a bit.
B00DHBOQMM|5.0|Criminal defence attorney Mickey Haller is back doing what he does best - running his small legal practice from the back of his Lincoln Town Car. He is still recovering from a time when switched sides to be a successful prosecutor, and he nearly became Los Angeles County District Attorney before disaster struck when a defence case went badly wrong and impacted his career and his relationship with his daughter and first wife.<br /><br />Mickey is always on the lookout for cases with the highest stakes and biggest paybacks and the top of the line are murder cases. One day Andre La Cosse, an internet \\"pimp\\" who designs and manages websites for call girls, asks Mickey to defend him on a murder charge. This case is different because the victim, Gloria Dayton, was a former client, a prostitute Mickey thought he had rescued and put on a straight and narrow path - but unknown to him she was back on the game. It is also different because just before Gloria's death she had told Andre he should contact Haller if he ever needed legal assistance. Andre also has the means to pay for his defence - in gold bullion!<br /><br />What starts off as a straightforward case of  providing a good defence for a guilty person quickly changes when Mickey realises that Andre may not be guilty.  The case quickly brings back the ghosts of Mickey's past which can have a serious impact on his professional and personal future. As this case develops it will  encompass a potentially corrupt DEA agent, a shady Investigator for the District Attorney, a cartel thug and a disbarred lawyer, all with their own personal interests in Mickey's future. To top all of this off Mickey is being watched and followed and he doesn't know who it is.<br /><br />Mickey needs all the help he can get to try to find an another killer to tie to Gloria's murder. In this he is helped by his strange but very effective team of associates.  His second wife, Lorna (still a very good friend), acts as his receptionist; her mountain of a husband, Cisco, is his investigator; and a young female attorney, Julie Aronson, is his very smart legal associate.<br /><br />Mickey's father (a lawyer too) told him that the jurors were the \\"Gods of Guilt\\" but from experience Mickey knows that the gods of guilt are judging us every day of our lives and in every move we make.<br /><br />Michael Connelly has moved Mickey Haller on from the days when he was seen as a \\"sleezy\\" lawyer in the first Lincoln Lawyer novel. While Mickey is still prepared to do courtroom tricks, he has matured into a skilled courtroom performer and morphed into a relentless pursuer of getting to the truth. This case tests him to the limit with one of the best courtroom finales I have read for a long time.<br /><br />Connelly is still at the top of his game and this is an entertaining page-turner that will satisfy Connelly's many fans and will undoubtedly be part of their Christmas reading wish lists.of a husband, Cisco, is his investigator; and a young female attorney, Julie Aronson, is his very smart legal associate.<br /><br />Mickey's father (a lawyer too) told him that the jurors were the \\"Gods of Guilt\\" but from experience Mickey knows that the gods of guilt are judging us every day of our lives and in every move we make.<br /><br />Michael Connelly has moved Mickey Haller on from the days when he was seen as a \\"sleezy\\" lawyer in the first Lincoln Lawyer novel.

B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Great film! I was hoping for more of the same from the first film and I got all that I could hope for and more. The way they incorporated the Kahn theme was masterful, can't wait for the next one.
0470474874|3.0|Uhfortunately, I have not had the time to indulge in this book as I would like. I hope to do so in the next couple months and learn more about EXCEL.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie, Fun, funny and entertaining..... Very action packed
B00C5ZORES|3.0|I listened to it once and then forgot I owned it. I guess that speaks to the forgettable quality of the album. I didn't hate it, but I can't say I intend to listen to it much.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Love Supernatural. It is very entertaining and funny as the series goes on. The whining between the brothers can get a little obnoxious but all in all a good series to own in the library
1401937519|5.0|Is a must! Is a real story. I enjoy the reading very very much there is much to learn from this book..
B00ERIUO02|1.0|I'm disgusted with this cd!!!!  I'd rather throw it away than give it to my niece!  Won't be listening to her music anymore!
B0098460O4|5.0|Beautiful album!  They are such a talented and exciting duo. It exceeded my expectations and I loved the album selections.
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|Love love love! With my new iphone 5s it goes perfect. Everyone tells me how pretty fancy phone i have.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Wonderful movie - recomment it to all.  It is truly not one expected but entertaining.; My family enjoyed it several times.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|It is taking me time to upload my own music from my computer. Only what i purchased through you works properly
B00EKR61FM|5.0|Although I hate sparkly vampires, I must say this is an awesome set to have. I do like the movies just not the sparkly vampire part.
6305428042|5.0|Who doesn't have this movie added to their annual Halloween repertoire? It's such a perfect fall movie. I love it!
B008JFUR10|4.0|Good action movie. However, the plot seemed a little odd to me. But I guess that's because I didn't read the comics where this is from? But I like monster movies so this was acceptable for that.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Obviously a 5-star review. Serenity is amazing. The only thing that would make it more amazing would be 6 or 7 seasons of Firefly before it. ;)
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I love this set and glad that I purchased it. It's one of the movies from my childhood that I can watch multiple times and never get tired of.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Given as a gift to my brother in law, he was very happy to receive this.  In fact, when he first got it he was watching it the next day.  Plus I was happy with the quick and speedy service I received, and the DVD was in excellent condition upon arrival.
B00E8G5H6Y|5.0|Star Wars the Clone Wars the complete season five is the best so far. All the seasons are great but again five to me is the best so far. I can't wait to see season 6 when it comes out next year.
1419702203|5.0|How can anything that George Harrison created not be rated 5 stars.  This is a wonderful book and enjoyable to relive younger days growing up with the Beatles.  You can't lose with this book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is amazing. The controls are easy to learn and handle and the graphics are pretty darn good! The game itself if challenging and enjoyable. For any age!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good for passing time or if your bored and need something to do! Like it! Download it. Give it a try!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I felt this book to me was sicking.......Also like porn so I won't order anymore of them.....bet this revies will sell more books
B00AC8ZIXO|3.0|The movie starts off kind of slow but builds in intensity and leads to what is a multifaceted surprise.  However, despite the good plot, the execution of the telling of the story leaves one a little confused, so, it's a little hard to follow.  I think the plot deserves a better presentation, not that the quality was cheap or anything.  I think the desire to hide the surprise ending may have led the director to conceal a little too much in the way of cues and clues as to what was going on.  Still, if you like sci-fi, it is worth the watch.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I wish it would work with Amazon Prime.  Otherwise, I love the way it works with Netflix, but there is more variety on Amazon Prime.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|The movie is scary enough.  One scene even made me jump in my chair a little.  The ending left me puzzled, though.  It was difficult to tell who won in the end.  Movies (or stories) often set up in the beginning and reinforce throughout the story the rules of the story's universe, i.e., how things work and why.  It seemed like all the work the main character went through, the whole movie, to try to reconcile the old haunt, believing he understood the rules, was for naught.  And so, it seemed like we spend most of the movie learning the rules of the universe but find out at the end they were all wrong.  To me, that is dissatisfying.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love Bingo Blitz! And it's always changing, adding new rooms. So many different places to go. It's fun!  :)
B000001ESF|5.0|This review is for the original vinyl version of this masterpiece. Truly one of the best sounding records I have ever heard. Neil Peart explodes out of my speakers with thunderous beats that will vibrate your rib cage! Hell yes!!! I have 20 Rush albums and I rank 2112 as number one! It doesn't get any better for me than this. Long live RUSH!!!! For a full rundown of all albums (have not yet heard Vapor Trails so it is not included):  Five star masterworks: 2112, Rush, All The Worlds A Stage (live), A Farewell To Kings, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Fly By Night, Exit Stage Left (live), Caress Of Steel, Grace Under Pressure, Moving Pictures Four stars: Different Stages (live), Counterparts, Power Windows (underrated my many) Three point five stars: Snakes and Arrows (really growing on me, instrumentals are incredible), Presto (Available Light!!!), Test For Echo (a few solid tracks and some filler) Three stars: A Show of Hands (live), Hold Your Fire, Roll The Bones, Clockwork Angels (would be higher if not for crappy production)  VINYL UPDATE: I wish I could give a super positive review of the new vinyl. My copy was quite noisy all the way through after a very thorough cleaning. The sound quality was quite good but did not match the original vinyl pressing that I own. All in all I am quite pleased with the reissue campaign but my 2112 was not perfect. I am not sure what to think about the hologram. Seems sort of annoying to have to purchase a special light to view it or stand there with a flashlight shining on it. Also using groove space at the expense of the sound quality is not recommended. I would say seek out a NM original pressing first but if you are collecting them (like me!) take the plunge.
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|I can't stop listening. He's the best! One of his best albums to date! I think it's better than part 1
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|neat app. does the job I wanted and I couldn't really ask for much more. also the design is nice,  reminds me a bit of tron lol
B001I45UFC|5.0|It is a very interesting book and I think that C.S. Lewis is a great story writer best book ever
1449410243|3.0|I never did give this gift as a present to my daughter in law. The book was a bit to irreverent and racy. I wish they would be more clear about this on book reviews, then again why do writers need to write that way at all.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|It's a game we can play without being asked to pay more  to go farther. I Like it cause it makes you stop and think. Good job Amazon.
B0058SNKM4|4.0|These are very comfortable and make my feet feel better after being on my feet all day at my job
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Not user friendly. Everytime you chose a video to watch you had to pick the right picture format. My three year old loves youtube and can navigate through it by her self. Not with tubemate. I got got fraustrated too with it.
B007THA4FI|1.0|What a confusing mess of characters! We read it for our Book Club for November and the general consensus was that it stunk. It was hard to read and keep all the characters straight in your mind since quite a few had nicknames (more than one) and she used them differently in the same paragraph so at times you couldn't figure out about whom she was talking.<br />Not sure if I'd read another of her adult novels. I know we all like things tied neatly in a bow at the end of our books, but she left several issues unresolved. Perhaps for a sequel?? I definitely won't read it if she does.
1616550414|5.0|Excelent quality in this book, perfect for any zelda fan!.<br />The book is heavy and the paper is of high quality, I recomend it!
B00003CXPD|5.0|If there were room for more stars, I'd add them. This is my favorite movie of all time!! Jamie Bell is precious as Billy and a great character study. I have watched it many, many times and somehow I never tire of it.
B006DGHYJK|1.0|The DVD d not work on a US player. I returned it. It is programmed for the UK not the US
B00D82BNLC|5.0|This was an amazing book!  I started it late last night and finished it up today while I was home alone!  The events in this book had me looking over my shoulder at every little noise I heard.  I was in awe with the relationship between Leigh and Aiden.  At times, I was hoping that their relationship blossomed and it did, beautifully.  I could not read through the chapters fast enough to get to the next.  I wanted to retain what I had read, but at the same time I was anxious for more.  Not once was I bored or felt the need to skip over all of the extra details.  I would recommend this book to anyone that loves the paranormal!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|You should have the sense to understand that each new game PUSHES THE LIMITS of what phones can do. SIMPLY download a game that isn't optimized for the newest tech...or upgrade your tech...either way you are silly for complaining about a free app.<br />Do you understand what type of memory, processing, and what version of android you are running? IT SAYS THAT YOU NEED ANDROID 4.0 OR HIGHER AND THE ORIGINAL KINDLE RUNS AN OLDER VERSION! READ AND UNDERSTAND YOUR TECH. YOUR INCOMPETENCE IS THE ISSUE, NOT THE PRODUCT.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really loved this book; I got it free but I would have gladly paid for it. The chemistry between those 2 was really believable and so  so hot. One of the best romance stories I've read in a long while.
B008JFUPZI|3.0|RIPD was a decent movie.  Though I was expecting more, from 2 of my more favorable actors.  RIPD has it's moments, and it really had a Men in Black feel to it.  It is a decent watch.  Check it out, but keep your expectations in check.  That is for certain.
B0084HJE0S|3.0|It gives a reasonable overview of what is available and possible.  It was informative for someone with no familiarity with HTML5 but I wouldn't pay for this title.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|I must say, I was expecting more from this movie.  And by expecting more, I meant more Will Smith. Now don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Jaden Smith... but I thought Will would have had a larger &#34;action&#34; roll.  After earth has a really interesting plot and Jaden does an excellent job.  But Jaden's face should have a larger image on the cover, that's for sure.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My son loves this, he jumps for 30 minutes at a time in this. Perfect gift, he is 7 months old.
B003274QH6|5.0|Let me start by saying, I don't even watch TV shows.  Not only do commercials absolutely suck me out of the moment (even DVR'd), but most aren't written well enough to keep me interested.  Not one, but then I heard about &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;.  So, I watched the first episode, and I had to have more.  So I bought the first season to see what it would do for me.  And then I NEEDED more.  Breaking Bad, in my opinion is the greatest experience in TV entertainment, it was certainly the best I have ever had.  Bryan Cranston was amazing, and Aaron Paul was fantastic.  You will be missed Breaking Bad... thank you for 6 great years.
B008602KQI|3.0|The book was much more interesting. Much more in-depth and many more hours of enjoyment. The visuals given by the book in your imagination are way beyond what film can express.

B0091REZMW|3.0|Worth trying it's fun when your bored at home with nothing to do it definitely keeps your attention if your not a tv person like myself!!!!
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Wow, Daniel Day-Lewis does it again.  Is this actor amazing or what?  Every role he takes, he darn near takes an Oscar home for it.  And he doesn't let us down here either.  His depiction of Abraham Lincoln was absolutely fascinating.  Great watch!
B00E9A656K|5.0|The reson I gave this a five star is because I enjoy it and I recoumend  a lot of people sould get this app and also it is FREE
B007JNR4WI|4.0|To me, this one of John Travolta's better films.  I truly believe that this movie has been underrated, and underappreciated.  I absolutely love him in this movie.  And the plot is absolutely &#34;Phenomenal&#34;.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to use and easy to set up. Came in on time. I own both Apple TV and Chromecast, but I think I'm leaning more towards the chromecast. Must buy!
B00770KR7W|5.0|As a collector of my favorite movie/game characters, I like to have the best available figurines.  And this is one of them.  Though it was smaller than I anticipated, it still is a great figurine.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Never got the Kindle app or Kindle to work on my Asus Transformer Prime TF201. After 5 hours and 8 customer associates &#34;helpers&#34; that could not tell me the right information, I just settle with that they or who ever is suppose to give me advise or technical help was inefficient in their job or jobs. I bought a book for my studies so I could study at home and use my tablet at the office when I had spare time but looks like that won't happen anytime soon till I figure out which online book source I will be using other than Kindle apps. Once I find one, I will discontinue using Kindle apps  and kindle ebooks for college. I'm a good customer from Amazon but this is a very disappointment for me due to fact that I have tolerated all lot of small things from the company when I needed technical service, it's not there. Good for purchasing items but other than that I will stick to the traditional companies for things that require online tech support, I will purchase it else where. If you want to know what happened, see the chat line to verify why I'm a dissatisfied customer.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|I love this series and reading the book was an extra treat. Highly engaging and informative. The similarities and differences make it more compelling. Wait until you see the difference on the endings!
074401493X|4.0|This guide is helpful, and has beautiful art and insight.  If you enjoy/enjoyed the last of us, this book is a good collectable
1452110581|5.0|I bought this little book for my husband, the cat lover.  We have many house pets, pet companions, pet children or whatever you want to call them.  This writer knows cats inside and out.  I think we have experienced every kind of activity described.  It was good to know we are not alone.  ;)  We do love our cats but sometimes the poop and pee can be too much and I want to escape to a desert island with no cats.  But for the most part they are great entertainment and a comfort on a cold winter's day.  If you love cats, you will love this book.  Even if you don't, you'll still get a good chuckle out of it.

B00CRS5HII|4.0|Great artist, Great album.  I love this music. His voice is amazing, and the lyrics are terrific.  Keep up the good work.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|World War Z is a terrific movie.  And I am not a huge Zombie fan, in my opinion the Zombie epidemic is just out of control, and over used.  There have been a few movies that have caught my attention... such as Zombieland and the &#34;infected&#34; movie I am Legend.  But World War Z has definitely received my praise and recommendation.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I watched this movie only because it was on Amazon Prime. It's not the sort of title I'd have bothered to rent or see in the theaters because I wasn't expecting anything out of it. I was pleasantly surprised at just how very watchable the movie was. The lead actors all did solid work, the effects and cinematography were all good, the story moved along at just the right pace, and the dialogue was far better than one usually sees in this sort of film. I expected to watch a bit of the movie and get bored, but I actually got caught up in it and enjoyed it right to the end. It's not going to go down in history as the next Blade Runner, but this is the most well done future-dystopia-type film I've seen in quite a long time.
B00B5HQL50|3.0|as always he delivers, sort of intense but as James Bond goes, his has lost the debonair flair and kind of vengeance is the theme
B00GGEVKYO|5.0|The Hobbit is a fantastic movie and the additional footage was worth the wait! New scenes include lots of character development at Rivendell.  This is a must have.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Good stuff. This game is waaaay better than the Facebook version...it's easy to play and a great way to grind away a few minutes
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this one. Maybe because Daniel Craig set the bar so high in the last 2. They did set the next one nicely though. I'm glad I watched it.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This book I think was pretty good and very hard to put down, but it was poorly written.  Didn't give too much info on the characters which was disappointing.
B0084YAU86|5.0|It is so good in all respects that nothing else on television comes close. The photography and editing is so outstanding, the production is so stylish, the writing exceptional and the performances are gripping..it is impossible to take your eyes off of the screen for a minute. Still cannot believe how exciting the entire series is...how worth the  investment of a mere 90 minutes per episode  to be transported into the wonderful world of Sherlock. A must see!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a good game, as far as some of them go. Who doesn't want to be the hero of your own kingdom? I found it very entertaining.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Ther is only admiration for a search back to such a horrible time in our history that lasted unbelievably longer than it should have!!  But this is testimony to the human element that would perpetuate this sick trait of human nature that should be eradicated!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love truism game. they have so many different worlds to go to rather than just one like temple run.  my favorite is the mall.
0307346617|2.0|To darn spuratic, the book jumps all over the place and is hard to follow at times... The movie is completely different.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Awesome app. I can print documents, anything with the share function and any picture on the web (just press the picture until the menu pops up then download - make certain you have photo paper loaded).<br />I loved the e-printer before I had the app and I love it even more after the app. If you have the HP printer then you HAVE to get this app.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|this app was fun till a freaking nasty ad poped up when I was playing and it ended up being an ad to this lorn sight. please delete them ads
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I give this device 4 stars because it has really helped me in my quest for better health.  That being said, there are some issues that I will list so that folks are aware and in the hopes that Withings will see this feedback and make some needed improvements.<br /><br />I have been using this device for a month or so now, and do really like it.  Having this on my person all day every day makes me much more aware of the activity level I have (or lack thereof).  According to WIthings you should take @ 10,000 steps a day to maintain a healthy lifestyle, plus have plenty of vigorous activity in that.  I was shocked to find that on a given day I average less than half the steps so it has encouraged me to park farther away, take more walks and pay attention to my activity level in general.  I recently took it with me to Universal Studios theme park and got 22,000 steps in one day!  :-)<br /><br />The ability to take a periodic pulse was one of the major reasons I bought this vs. the FitBit.  While it does take a pulse, I have found it really hard to get it to work consistently.  I've tried different fingers, different spots on the fingers, etc. and it is still hit or miss.  Sometimes it take my pulse and generates a rate of 154bps which I know is incorrect!  So I would say it only takes an accurate count about 50-60 percent of the time the first time around.  It take me 2-3 tries to get what I feel is probably correct.  When you synch to the app, it still records the high inaccurate ones, but fortunately you can edit them in the app and discard the known bad counts. I also have this synched with MapMyRide for my road bike activity and it works well for that.  The synch works okay to the app, but occasionally for no known reason it tells you to open the app to synch, but I think they are supposed to be fixing that in a firmware release so it will sync in the background.<br /><br />My biggest complaint (besides the pule rate issues) is with the &#34;sleep band&#34; included, and the clip case you are supposed to keep it in.  When you want it to track your sleep, you put it in this neoprene arm band, tell it you are going to sleep and sleep away.  When you wake in the morning, you turn sleep mode off and it records your sleep patterns.  It really does an accurate job in my opinion of tracking your sleep as long as the band does not fall off your wrist!  This has happened to me many times and frustrates me.  The Velcro that holds the band on your arm is weak to say the least.  It falls of really easily which of course ruins that nights tracking.  May not sound like a big deal, but I have been trying different things to see what affect they have on my sleep (sleep aids, nature sounds, cup of tea before bed, etc.), and when the thing falls off it makes me do it again the next day which is a pain.  I also forgot one day to take it off of sleep mode, forgot to take it with me when I left for the day and it recorded 19 hours of sleep which I was not able to edit out later like you can the pulse readings.  Need that edit function or it ruins the stats.<br /><br />The small black clip provided I just do not use at all.  It is hard to clip on (but never falls off as a result), and you have to remove the device from the clip to take a pulse reading.  This clip needs some work to be sure, I don't use it and just carry the device in my pocket.  I am constantly afraid I will lose it as a result.<br /><br />I really like the ability to get feedback directly from the device as opposed to like the FitBit where for the most part you have to sync it then read info from the app on your phone.  I hit one button and know my activity status for the day for e.g., and that makes it more usable.  The battery life is awesome and it does warn you at 20% so that you know to get it to a charge soon.  It charges really fast as well.<br /><br />So all in all my experiment with the Withings Pulse has been a good one and I do recommend it but hope Withings will work on the few shortcomings I have highlighted.<br /><br />I do recommend this device -- it will make you more health conscious!
B004RJMUJO|2.0|my little brother bought the app for free and he's had it for a while so I went on to the kindle fire saw that it costed money bought it and its the same as the free version
B00GIXWXEO|4.0|Turbo kind of surprised me.  With so many of the animated movies they tend to go for the cheap laughs that kids will enjoy, but is groan enducing for adults.  You just can't wait for it to end.  Turbo offers up no surprises, but it ends up being a decent movie that you can enjoy as a family.  By the end, my 7 year old was standing up cheering for Turbo.  Honestly, I was cheering inside too.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I get bored of it and there are to many ads but my little one enjoys it pretty well so I woundnt recommend not to get it
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is the second best series, next to the hunger games. So much drama! <3<br /><br />I loved this book so much.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I like it a lot and enjoy playing it. I get bored of it once in a while,  but I like it especially since it is free
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Thought this game was great at first. But there aren't enough ways to earn crowns except for purchasing them. I want to play games for fun not to delete my bank account. I give it three stars though because it is a beautiful game and fun game.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun game. Much better then the original castleville. Hope to see more zynga games offered for kindle fire in the near future.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|See with new eyes<br />Witness glory in the common and extravagent<br />Smile.... A lot<br />And laugh... Sometimes it is impossible not to.... Witness Kingsley<br />Love this... Humans win.
0316055433|5.0|It's all here - a quirky orphan, mysterious Europeans, poor little rich upper east side girl, the Met, boarding school preppies...<br />this book is entirely readable and what a great story and amazing characters!  I will say that the last 100 pages do not keep up the pace of the first 600 pages but other than that it's close to perfect!  it's a tale of fate and roads taken - or not...all the what ifs of life...there is a wonderful mother/son relationship and many interestingly drawn characters.  I was completely immersed in this book and could barely come up for air!  ms. tartt's talent is enormous.  she is seriously one of our greatest American authors!  what a way with words, and what a compelling storyteller!  I look forward to her next work, and I hope it doesn't take another 10 years!
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|its an ok game but it stopped working after the update.  I tried to tap something but it didn't work.I couldn't do anything in the game so I deleted it.:(
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is the only Christmas Carol that keeps the colsets to the book, other use certain language from the book here and there...include the old Alister Simms and George C Scott's versions, but this outshines them all with the use of descriptions and language right from Disckens...plus who doesn't love Kermit? Michael Caine makes a great Scrooge!
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Zack Snyder made superman more of a lumberjack than a boy scout, thankfully. The character, tech, and world design in this movie made George Lucas look amateur. Also, it was the best Superman script. Earth and humanity seemed big in this movie. Superb story telling.
B0087HT36U|2.0|It is impossible on some levels to get the ammo to launch before moving parts ( trains and such)  hit the obstical.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|One if the worst movies I've ever seen. The script was stupid beyond belief. The ridiculous Hollywood liberal political bias was laughable.
0385537131|3.0|I like most JG books...and this is no exception.<br /><br />I give the story line a strong 4...it engaged me and I wanted to know what was going to happen next - initially.<br /><br />The narrator did a good job...no complaints there.<br /><br />However, my biggest complaint, the book was too wordy....Way toooo long.<br />This is not really an issue for me when I read, as skimming is easy enough.<br />It is another story when I'm driving and listening to a book.<br /><br />I began to fast forward toward the end of the book - the best part I'm sure - as I just thought enough already.<br /><br />When you read all the 5 star reviews, don't get your hopes up too high.<br />It is kind of like back in the 80's when ET came out and everyone talked about how good it was.<br />So the people who saw it after hearing all the rave reviews had higher expectations and didn't really think the movie was that good.<br />I felt this way about Sycamore Row - though it was good.<br /><br />All in all I recommend Sycamore Row - don't expect too much and be prepared to skim a little.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great alternative to Directv...but wish chromecast offered more free channels like roku does.  Hopefully one day!  Cable and satelite services are goners!  This is the future!

0804168431|5.0|I really liked this book.  It was an interesting story about a topic that's always sad to read about.  I am now really looking forward to the movie.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|The first season was interesting and this second season was silly, now the third season looks soooo stupid I'm all together passing.....if you are going to buy this get the first season, the second is pretentious and not worth the money.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A compilation of true events that make it extremely hard to put down! A WWII enthusiast will enjoy the read as it pertains to two fighter pilots serving their country. Interesting to learn how the \\"other\\" side treated the war and it's atrocities. Well written, free flowing account of the bravery of two pilots who have a \\"chance\\" meeting that leads to a long term lasting friendship some 50 years after the war! An incredible account that has been researched to no end!
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I originally had no intention of seeing this, however my nephew recommended it and he has excellent taste. This review is about the PG 13 version. I understand there is an unrated, more violent version, but I don't see that it's necessary. I personally love that the &#34;gore factor&#34;  was kept to a minimum, making this more of a suspense/action thriller. Also, although there's the inevitable CGI effects, they're also kept to a minimum. The story's the main thing here, which makes this movie so enjoyable. There are good characters, whom you hope will survive, and that's so important. I think the rating is &#34;spot on&#34; for this movie. If you sent the younger children to bed, this would actually make a pretty good &#34;family film&#34; for the evening. I watched it with my 86-year-old mother, and she enjoyed it. Check it out!
B0032UYFA6|3.0|I have some difficulty in hearing and the lack of CC in English was a great disappointment! The broadcast editions all had captions.
B00DONF9SS|4.0|I like the figure but i noticed they put some white paint on her left arm band thingy, the blue end of her glove :L I tried removing it but I only got some off and its not alot so it's whatever, I wish tese figures were higher quality but i guess thats why their cheaper .-. I have to be honest though.. I was more excited when sailor moon came in so i guess mercury isn't my favorite but i still want to collect the Classic set of the figures since the Zero sailor moon R figure is expensive..
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Fun, unique story, and very entertaining without being crass. I read this while I was recovering from surgery, and it was not overly taxing but neither was it a dumb-dumb book. Highly recommended!

0670024856|5.0|Beautifully written, with incredibly accurate details about life in the nineteenth century. The depiction of botanical science is excellent. A word of caution for anybody who imagines this is primarily a period piece about the practice of botany: the botany is a vehicle for the erotic subtext that is almost shocking.

B00B0LPWU6|3.0|It's your basic Denzel movie.  First 45 mins were pretty amazing but plot after that was just flat.  I would not pay for it but it's free on prime so why not.

0060873175|5.0|Once you get past the idea of shrinking objects it is absolutely wonderful.<br />  As a biologist, I particularly appreciate its encounters with beastly animals.<br />  It easily surpases Jurassic Park.<br /><br />  Mr Preston has done magnificently in finishing an incomplete book
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Very good movie. Keeps you interested. However I was told it was good inspirational movie for addicts. I have a family member who this pertains to and we watched it together. Warning very graphic drug use in the beginning. Denzel Washington is a great actor and does not disapoint in this movie!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|An exciting book with a very creative plot. Grisham used his skill keeping me turening the pages; it was hard to put down.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I loved the first half of this book, but I felt like it really ran out of steam (no pun intended) in the middle.  While it was interesting to find out what Danny Torrance has been up to since &#34;The Shining&#34;, this book is nowhere near as good as the first.<br /><br />For me, the biggest problem is that the antagonists of the story just aren't very scary compared to some of King's other creations.  There weren't many of the tense, scary moments that you find in Stephen King's best books.<br /><br />I'd only recommend this to people who are huge fans of &#34;The Shining&#34;.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|The lyrics are a desert that is conceptually shallow, as a result it gives the impression of being not particularly satisfying.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|I am finding the OfficeSuite Pro by Mobi Systems is a much better product of Office apps for my tablet.  The apps are more robust and truer to form with the MS Office Suite.  Documents To Go is OK, but not my preference.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easiest possible streaming solution available.  And a great price, to boot.  There is no device to program or provide power.  Just stick it right and your tv and bam!
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|I am a long time fan of Preston And Child.  This book did not disappoint.  T story and both fast paced, detailed and informative.  Grab a cup of coffee have  seat and enjoy.
B00FDX9CGW|5.0|Missouri native Janelle Monae has a decade's worth of experience in the music industry, but only recently has she just gotten recognition. As a teenager, she released her independent debut \\"The Audition\\"- an album that was self-produced and self-released. Despite the limited amount of copies that were made, her album made it into the hands of OutKast member Big Boi. He signed her to his Virgin Records distributed record label Purple Ribbon Entertainment. Around the time she was prepping her major label introduction, Virgin went through a massive corporate restructuring- which caused Purple Ribbon to lose their distribution with the label. Oddly enough, Janelle received an offer from the unlikeliest of labels- Sean \\"Puffy\\" Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment. After aligning herself with Combs, she released the EP \\"Metropolis: The Chase Suite\\" in 2008. She followed it with her sophomore effort- 2010's \\"The ArchAndroid\\"- an album that was critically acclaimed, but overly ambitious. However, for her next project, she went through a few changes.<br /><br />In 2012, Bad Boy Entertainment took up distribution with Interscope Records- leaving behind Janelle at Atlantic. Also, her new image wasn't as restricted to her formal suit and tie wardrobe. Musically, she decided to tone it down for her next album \\"The Electric Lady\\". She works with the production team Deep Cotton (Nate Wonder and Chuck Lightning)- the same team she worked with since her \\"Metropolis\\" EP. While she has scaled back on the influence of a myriad of genres, she has taken cues from the funk rock era of R&B. Look no further than the punk rock inspired \\"Givin' 'Em What They Want\\", which features an appearance from Prince. She duets with Erykah Badu on the objectification themed \\"Q.U.E.E.N.\\" as well as Miguel on the ballad \\"Primetime\\".  Solange Knowles guests on the the title track \\"The Electric Lady\\", while Janelle makes an attempt for a pop crossover on the catchy \\"Dance Apocalyptic\\". On the second half of the album, she mellows out with mostly ballads like \\"It's Code\\", the inspirational \\"Victory\\" and \\"Can't Live Without Your Love\\". She takes cues from Stevie Wonder on the synth heavy \\"Ghetto Woman\\" as well the song \\"Dorothy Dandridge Eyes\\". Overall, \\"The Electric Lady\\" is another great album from Janelle Monae. While the album is more accessible than its predecessors, it still has traces of her trademark sound.m, she mellows out with mostly ballads like \\"It's Code\\", the inspirational \\"Victory\\" and \\"Can't Live Without Your Love\\".

B00DYFCYSO|5.0|John Legend has come a long way in his fifteen year career. While he was still in high school, he was summoned to play piano on Lauryn Hill's \\"The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill\\" on the song \\"Everything Is Everything\\". A few years later, a chance meeting with producer Kanye West led to him appearing on the song \\"Encore\\" from Jay-Z's then-retirement album \\"The Black Album\\". Kanye later started the label G.O.O.D. Music, where John would release his formal debut \\"Get Lifted\\" in 2004. That album would spawn his signature song- and biggest hit- \\"Ordinary People\\". He then would follow it with the dark and moody sophomore set \\"Once Again\\". In 2009, he went left of center on his third recording \\"Evolver\\"- an album that saw him abandon the piano driven ballads in favor of synth heavy pop songs and dance records. He teamed up with The Roots for an all covers album \\"Wake Up!\\" in 2010 before laying low to record his next album. He returned to his roots as a balladeer, also while adding something new to the mix. To that end, he continues to make great music.<br /><br />In 2013, he released his fifth album- the appropriately titled \\"Love In The Future\\". His album is a return to the sound that many of his fans have come to know him for. On \\"Love In The Future\\", he works with his longtime collaborators Dave Tozer and Kanye West. However, this time around, he brings along a few new faces to the fold. Producer Hit-Boy (best known for his work with Brandy, Kanye and Jay-Z) produces the song about falling in love instantly \\"The Beginning\\" as well the closing track \\"Caught Up\\".  Bink (Lost Boyz, Curren$y, Backstreet) produces the Rick Ross featured \\"Who Do We Think We Are\\". The Runners (Young Jeezy, Tamia) produce the song about reeling from a breakup \\"Save The Night\\", while 88-Keys hands in the song \\"Holds On Longer\\". John attempts a cover of Bobby Caldwell's 1980 song \\"Open Your Eyes\\" and also does a brief cover of Anita Baker's hit \\"Angel\\" with singer/songwriter Stacy Barthe. \\"Love In The Future\\" is a standout collection from John Legend. He has grown musically within his long career and the growth has made him a better artist because of it.he Future\\" is a standout collection from John Legend.

B0087GJ8KM|4.0|Decent read with a tremendous about of data. The new ABC's are not only practical but required to survive in the new era of sales. I recommend this book to any sales person that simply wants to enhance their ability to sell.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|From the beginning, the actors and the story had me hooked.  It isn't like most where it is more about violence and action and sex, though at times this may play some role in the scene. This is what could actually happen.  It also has great characters with actors who can make the people they play so very real.  I have become a big fan of Damien Lewis and Clare Danes because of this series. I have seen Damien Lewis in two other series. His ability to become the character and bring it to life are outstanding, in my opinion.  I also love Sol's character.  I have not watched one episode that my mind drifts as so many movies or series become so predictable after a while i.e. the series 24.
B00008EY7H|5.0|Cirque Du Soleil is a must see for any family looking for quality level and amazing performance. This DVD helps to keep us glued until the next time the event is on our vacation plans.
140006922X|4.0|This was a good read. always nice to have some historical perspective. I doubt hard core Christians will appreciate it though.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great addition to my &#34;Everything 007 Bond&#34; collection including my Bond 50: The Complete 22 Film Collection set.  Family was in London after watching the movie at the big screen.  We took a private walking tour and family and I was able to relate to many scenes in the movie and surprised what were done in closed studio setting. Came as close to the MI5 building before being asked not to get any closer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, it is much more fun over the original game. I'm hooked. When a story line is added, the game has more substance.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|Family always love watching the Cirque Du Soleil performances and can't get enough of it.  After seeing a couple of live events, we continue to keep an eye on local performances.  For now, this 3D Blu-Ray will suffice.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Simply beautiful. This sequel perfectly captures the spirit of King 's Shining and us just as spooky. I loved it.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Just a bada** show! Love it! Dirty cops that you have to like until the last season. Then..................not so much.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|This is a wonderful story of a young girl's tragic viewing being taken into adult hood, without the knowledge that would have set her free from her anxieties about her mother.  It is truly worth reading as the end will make you breath a sigh, and be glad that you live in the present and not the past.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I'm hooked on the food magazine, always finding something new.  This is where I found out about cronuts! There are a lot of recipes and the best part is you can create your own &#34;magazines&#34;, saving your favorite articles to review again.

1401917232|2.0|After reading Gary's first two books I was really looking forward to reading this one.  Unfortunately it was disappointing.<br /><br />It would have been much better if Gary had left his personal politics out of it.  Gary now claims to be an Independent, but you know what they say about &#34;walking like a duck&#34; and &#34;quacking like a duck&#34;.  The political bias comes out when he only speaks negatively about one party but not the other.  Neither one is perfect, so why only condemn one?  It really causes the book to lose all credibility.<br /><br />I also had hoped for more information about the &#34;in between life&#34; as well as the spiritual aspects(on this level-form) of marriage and divorce.<br /><br />It has been said that &#34;It is okay to tell the waiter that the soup is cold&#34;.  Well Gary, the soup is cold.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game only problem is that it's really addicting! I love playing with my friends and seeing where I compare to them- it's fun and it may get difficult but life's hard so don't feel too bad about it. :) Enjoy!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have never had the need of writing a review but i felt that i need to do so in this  one. Trust me when i say this is a very interesting story of two broken people helping each other heal. I wont say more because i hate spoilers but to all you people out there being so negative COME ON!! This is like a readers dream come true a wonderful story that just keeps getting better and better, and is not being rushed to end. I love the crossfire novels and can't wait to read the next one… <3
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It was nice to revisit the Torrance Family, and meet new intwined characters that were both interesting and well-crafted, which has come to be expected from Mr. King. Recommended for both the new class of Stephen King fans, as well as the long-time readers, but reading 'The Shining' is a prerequisite in my opinion.
0671510991|5.0|Think what you will about Kissinger's activities while in government, but it is unquestioned that he is a historian and political theory scholar of the highest order. This book is a case study of many different leaders and the foreign policy challenges they faced through a domestic and international lens. Kissinger carefully extrapolates the lessons to take from these leaders so that the reader gains a clear understanding that many historical events really could have been influenced if the right ideas and perspectives were in place at the time.

B0043GAZYS|5.0|I am really fond of this movie. Not being a fan of the comic, I came into this movie with no expectations. Perhaps even low expectations, as I find the lead, Michael Cerra to be a bit annoying. However, the movie is so visually striking and distinct. If you've ever wondered what would it be like if real life were a comic book or video game, this movie gives the best approximation. The characters are all also very witty and charming in their own ways. I highly recommend this move to old school gamers and people that are up for an adventurous movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.
1405911662|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It wasn't a five star book for me.  The book was an easy and enjoyable read.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Season 1 of Game of Thrones vividly re-creates the  images of the characters and physical surroundings that I had while reading the book.  The writing and acting are superb. This is a fantasy world, but a believable world. As a review I read said, Game of Thrones is  kind of like The Sopranos meets Lord of the Rings.  I'm still reading the first book in the series (it's nearly 1,000 pages) and these images remain in my brain.  Don't miss it.
0375507256|4.0|Very interesting ... very different.... very thought provoking.  Definitely read the book.  Save yourself from the movie.  It doesn't do the book justice

0385528787|3.0|I almost didn't write this review. In part because if you read the first two, then you need to finish the trilogy no matter how bad it rates, and second, I don't take any joy from bashing Atwood's last book in the trilogy.<br />The first book was amazingly insightful, and scarily imaginative. The more you know about the current state of our food industry, the more real it becomes. The second book was great! Suspense, back story, eventful. It seemed like Atwood was building up to a really, really great finale. This last book was supposed to be fantastic. Everything was set in place, and she certainly made us wait long enough. Instead. At least 1/3 of the book is all about Zed. And the rest about the Craker's. It got to the point where I found myself saying  &#34;enough with these damn Craker's already&#34;! Needless to say. I was disappointed, and feel that it fell short.
B000069KGM|5.0|This is the best of Chicago and this album put them on the map in a big way.  When it came out it was very different, because horns where not that cool in rock and roll.  Chicago made them cool again.  There first few albums were excellent.  This one was the first and best.

B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is the book that got me started with this fabulous author.  I couldn't put it down, and neither have the folks I've recommended it to.  Not a good book to read if you actually need to get something else done!  (But the perfect book for long flights, vacations, rainy afternoons)
0785153942|4.0|If you enjoyed the movie, this is a decent little prequel story for the movie.  My opinion is it's a bit on the short side, but the story was entertaining.

B00AKOB7CG|4.0|I like this app. It helps me get a little exercise in my hotel rooms. It might go quick but I think that's a good thing. And as always, it's free so I don't care about the occasional advertisement at the bottom of the screen. The sound could stand to be improved. I have to turn the volume all the way up on my kindle when I do it, but that doesn't really bother me. If you want a free exercise app to add to your routine, I'd check this one out.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book is an all-star ramble through the woods of ultramarathoning, dumping on many myths about running and affirming truths that the running bloggers seldom touch upon. It supplants the &#34;loneliness of the long-distance runner&#34; with joy and love and a wealth of practical tips that I have already put to use, even as I sit here writing this review in a burst of energy from a chia-seed cocktail whose origins trace back to the remote mountains of Mexico. I loved the book and everyone in it. ¡Que bueno!
B001JL2V1K|2.0|I have to say, this was a slightly disappointing concert....I get the idea of celebrating 50 years of the Fender stratocaster...it's a wonderful instrument...what I don't get is why this lineup in no way reflected the best and most famous Strat players. Some of the artists on here aren't known at all for using Strats...none more so than Brian May...he's famous for playing his own homemade guitar....he even plays at this concert! And Ronnie wood..his first song is played using a Gibson acoustic and then he plays stay with me at the end....a song that wasn't even recorded using a strat! A few of the songs in this concert weren't recorded using Strats so I just can't see why they're on there......and then you've got Paul Rodgers...fair enough, he played a strat...but then he brings his kids on to sing some washy washy song that has nothing to do with Fender...just seemed like he wanted to give them some stage time... biggest elephant in the living room through....where the hell was Clapton? How can you celebrate 50 years of the Fender Stratocaster without involving Eric Clapton? Don't waste your money....buy Eric claptons crossroads guitar festival dvd instead....you'll see far more fenders and far better music.

B005HEK3JW|5.0|With Season 5 the writers, directors, and actors were in full sync and traveling at full warp. For me I especially like<br />\\"Darmok\\", \\"Cause and Effect\\" and \\"Inner Light\\". So much that my brother in law Eric and I will recite lines from Darmok at holiday dinners. Season 5 also stars Leonard Nimoy in two episodes. Need I say more.

0877284520|5.0|This deck has fantastically detailed & spiritually evocative imagery. The artwork is many layered & each individual card can be meditated on in some depth. Not one for the faint hearted though.
B008KWHKGM|5.0|It's like getting both of their CDs, only the first one is live. Beautiful music. I love it. So glad I purchased it.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|It's true, all songs are great. I think I like it even better than Fever. Favorites: Get Outta My Way, Aphrodite, and Cupid Boy.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|Predictable story with underdeveloped characters. Far from Grisham's best. Would have benefited from better editing and a serious reduction in length.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Grisham is always a good writer; but the book just doesn't hold a calendar to A Time to Kill.  As a sequel to such a powerful book, it falls way short.  On it's own, it's a well-written story.  I just expected more.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is like the most brilliant accessory for a headset. It is just way too useful to travel around with this.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|This may be the last book from this author that I buy ( although I've said this before).  Her writing style has become too rambling and wordy with description. I find myself skipping sentences just to get to the storyline.  For goodness sake, it takes chapters just to get to her plots (such as they are anymore).  The later books  are almost retrospectives with very little plot value.<br /><br />I have read and own every book she has written and faithfully read and look forward to a new book coming out. Not so much anymore.<br /><br />Having said that, she was my favorite author for many years  - not so now. I feel sad for the loss of the old Kay Scarpetta.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a pretty fun game it's really hard to get gru coins though other than that it's really fun and good for children and adults
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Loved at first, but they disabled features to cast your laptop screen.... just use it to cast , Netflix etc now, but my smart TV can do that. .. oh well<br /><br />Im looking for Microsoft to get up off there butts and make one of these that can cast from the XBONE to one of these for DVR tv etc. .. .  or TIVO to do something similar.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Great selection of Fleetwood Mac oldies.  Great to listen to some of the better music of all time. I would recommend it!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Half way through and so far almost every episode has been intriguing and thrilling. Occasional down times and plot inconsistencies, but it's all part of the mysteries of Fringe.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|A complex, absorbing tale written in a wry third-person narrative.  I found the central story of the \\"angel\\" and the scientist quite moving and totally believable. The side story concerning the unusual destiny of an unattractive stray dog from Tahiti is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />The author tended to repeat herself occasionally, as though she thought the reader might not be able to follow along and needed reminders.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Without doubt much of what Grisham writes mirrors real life experiences for many.  Grisham tells a good story and what one becomes increasingly aware of is the role of lawyer compensation for services sp rendered.  The law field is becoming crowded and the quest for &#34;business&#34; can - and often does! - involve dubious and perhaps illegal activities of the very lawyers themselves as they seek 'justice' for their clients and enriched compensation packages.
0316055433|3.0|I wish I could give this book five stars, I truly wish,because I have loved and love donna tartt soo much .<br />to put it this way, she said in the end ,that &#34;life ,for whatever else it is, is short..&#34; i really want to say, actually it REALLY doesn't seem to be short by reading your book.it took me nearly a month to finish it ,unbelievable!!!<br />I have read the secret history and then got absolutely stupefied wondering around at school, not because the book was in any way really gripping ,it was flawed and little long-winded , constantly giving readers leaks and later failed addressing them properly ,repetitively brandishing the grandness of the theme(ie the title) and inevitably leading up to a huge bringdown.<br />The difference is ,I falled in love with &#60;the secret history &#62; because I was attracted to the core mantra “beauty is harsh” and the distant pensiveness of those characters, of course they were just fictitious characters who were endowed by tart with rare talent and cultural cultivation, but it didn’t take me much effort to lure my self into the fishy authenticity of the book, I was drunk in it ,I loved the extreme way they believe in loyalty piety and sacrifice, which is still what I believe made &#60;the secret history&#62; so powerful to me-------- a gesture of beauty.<br />But &#60;the goldfinch&#62; ,lord , this is the kind of book you can pick any page to read without missing much, I spent a couple of weeks slogging through it , i m still a college student,while I’m at canteen I read it with my kindle, when I’m at a class I give it a peek, but everytime when I picked it up it became a dreary matter,I thought to my self, where was I again?nah..it doesn’t matter, it reads like the same anyway... i haven't read a single page of IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME, but after goldfinch, it will be wise for me to cross it off from my bucket list.<br />i don't think i will be the lonely voice from wilderness to say that &#34;goldfinch&#34; is flimsy,The protagonist , one of the voices have the lone reeds , did drug with his bff boris, (sufficient gesture description ,sketchy emotional connection). Some of her description of people seem too stiff like “he brushed/flick/push his hair aside”, that’s an awkward way of trying to flesh out the characters in a non-consuming, natural way.(not everybody start a sentence by touch their hair ,at least not most of the time ,)<br />Why don’t you cut out all those totally unnecessary daily routine between theo and boris ,and replace it with some more details about his encounter with pipa, so the ending wouldn't seem so abrupt(as always.....)<br /><br />For those of you who give the book 5stars ,you either are more serious a donna fan than me ,or you are out of your minds
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What a wonderful story. It made me both cry and laugh. It is a heart warming story of sorrows and joy with just the right touch of humor. A founder read
B00F880BWG|5.0|love this show. It doesn't carry one like other shows. They do a good job keeping you on your feet. I'm not saying that every show is great, but the series is great in general.
0847842134|5.0|An amazing reprint!  Who would have thought the original could be surpassed, but this edition exists in a dimension even more pleasant than the one the original print came from.
0596805527|5.0|Possibly the best book on Javascript out there. Very detailed, as up to date as could be, and the code examples are excellent and useful in the real world.

B001B3MCQK|4.0|Just found out about Rodriguez and only listened to the album once all the way through, but already hooked!!!  I'd even give it a 4.5*, awesome lyrics, written 30+ yrs ago, but never more relevant!!!  Great musician with something meaningful to say in a beautiful way!!<br />Sounds like a combo of many of the great 60's bands(Dylan, Nillson,Jethro Tull, Donovan, Jefferson Airplane...), but his own awesome style too!!!
0307352153|5.0|Really absorbing and educating book, and easy and enjoyable to read.  It's an eye-opening revelation of human behavior and feelings.
B0058W74UY|2.0|This player did not work with the program I wanted to use it with. I may have downloaded a wrong version of the program. For me it did not work on my kindle.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|A great story. It kept our interest all the way through. We love anything with Denzel Washington. He is a great actor.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game. Makes you think a little and the challenges vary in each level. Okay graphics but it's free!!! Excellent deal
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Usually blow through a good series as fast as I can. But savored these realizing Larsson would no longer write.  Enjoyed this quite a lot. Also led me to other Nordic authors that I enjoy as well...
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is a great language app. Easy to use, easy to follow, and pretty comprehensive. There needs to be a German to English option but other than that, I have no issues.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A great read for any couple.  I wish I had understood this years ago.  This book makes it easy to talk about differences.
B009EHDU7U|2.0|I went into this book expecting more as was quite excited about the potential for a storybook that spanned a 100 years of history.  Felt a little too childlike in terms of skimming over incredible times in history, but if you're just looking for a basic, easy read that doesn't tax your brain then I guess this is for you.
B00B5C0YOO|3.0|Crashes phone on multiple auto updates. There needs to be a delay before the auto backup starts or a way to stop the auto backup option immediately, not through the setup. I had 8 updates, the AppMonster kicked in so fast trying backup while my phone was trying to dload the new files it crashed. So when the phone rebooted AppMonster started again even after I removed the auto backup option.<br />Need more control over app
1452110581|5.0|This was a gift and the recipient loved it--she is a &#34;cat person&#34; and it fit right well with her and her furry friends.
B003CYKCHW|5.0|This was my first real gaming mouse. I did eventually upgrade to the rat 7, but only because I loved this mouse so much. I wore it out one of the thumb buttons because I smashed it in using it for push to talk. I still use this one for another computer.<br /><br />The overall feel of this mouse is great. The texture is perfect, a little soft and really keeps it from feeling sweaty and gross even after long gaming sessions.<br /><br />The slide is very smooth, especially on a gaming surface type mousepad.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this mouse. I just decided to upgrade to one of the higher models with more buttons.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love this book! I have seen the movie quite a few times but the book is a bit different. I liked the book ending better than the movies' ending. This is a good book for children.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Great price and shipping! I already knew I loved the film, but somehow my family ended up misplacing this four-disc set so I replaced it for probably way less than it cost us to begin with.
034580404X|5.0|50 Shades of grey, the trilogy all together was amazing the way that I was allowed to connect with the characters in the books was amazing. I read all three in a timely manner just because I never wanted to put it down. The only thing that wasn’t so good was that it was a very mature style and she also tended to use certain words in ways they should not be used. But with the fact that it was such an inappropriate topic she allowed the story to go beyond that so you didn’t have to think about the sexual scenes you could actually connect to the people that were falling in love and see how they developed together. I think these books are amazing and I would recommend them to anyone as long as they have a mature sense of humor and are able to control their selves under embarrassing and awkward situations. This book is not meant for a young teenager minds, but is very inspirational to any mature younger women. This book may be hard to get over the sexual thoughts but once you have it is a great read.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Great season & program, overall.  Due to the sudden network cancellation there are some loose ends, which left me dissappointed. However, they wrapped things up the best they could and it is still a season fans cannot miss! I don't think the network truly realized what a HUGE mistake they were making by not allowing this show to continue.  The movie planned for release in 2014 should help clarify things though.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I played Candy Crush on Facebook and really like it but I like the. convenience of playing it on my kindle better. I do not like having to play the quests and waiting 72 hours or more to finish them. That is the reason I gave 4 stars instead of five.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|This was awesome! Loved the game. A must for HO folks! Can't wait till the sequel comes out! Hope that it's soon!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I love this game but I am stuck on level 2.6 I just don't know :(  so take to you later peace
B006LSZECO|2.0|No idea why so many people rave about this book. The first half is boring and the second just too far fetched and pretty much stupid. On top of that the ending is the epiphany of disappointment.<br />Also more appropriate title for the book would have been Psycho Bitch
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Entertaining and fun fun fun. Oh jeez. The way to the river is through the gem but mind the alligator.
0920668372|5.0|This was a favorite of my boys when they were young, and I purchased this as a gift for a family member.  The illustrations are charming, and the message is classic mother-speak.
B003VS0CX8|1.0|Love the movie, but ordered the disc and it would not play. (I have a high end sony with automatic updates that until now will play anything).<br />As per customer service I reordered the discs, but again it wouldn't play. (The frustrating thing is that the 20th Century logo plays then the disc goes blac and freezes the DVD player - I then have to unplug the DVD player and resart to eject the disc).<br />I spoke with customer service and the rep said that the same thing happens to her disc. She said she would take the disc off of Amazon and give me a refund. Neither has happened.<br />So beware and good luck.
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|a classic! what kid doesn't love to read this over and over when first learning about reading? great art work  as well.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|just not the right item for me did not work on my  tablet<br />i have a coby and am finding it hard to find the right apps
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like this game. You will like it to, if you try it . It is free. What you got to lose.
B00GHJ6BJW|3.0|Some songs are filler, but a few achieve a higher standard. This is sort of the record where Gaga comes across as a trouper, a hard-working troubador, always willing to put in the sweat and tears even if there isn't as much inspiration. The collaborations are the best part, she plays really well with others, though some may enjoy the ballads and others (like me) may be more partial to the hard dance tracks. I like Aura, G.U.Y., Do What You Want (great R.Kelly guest spot!), and Applause, which is really the theme song of the whole album: she wants it, she needs it, she knows it doesn't mean everything, but she'll still do anything to keep getting it.
B0033BD280|5.0|I love this album.  Dave Brubeck was a master of his art.  I wish I had gotten the vinyl years ago.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I hate having to wait on my energy to refill before I can move on in a game like this one where you have to find items.
B000FLYM9Y|5.0|I've always loved this album and the quality of the vinyl shipped was far better than I had expected despite it's age.
B00756GKBA|4.0|But not Madonna's best work its just comes off as a decent album, much better than 'Hard Candy'. Hopefully she will revisit 'Ray of Light' territory someday.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Amazing story and awesome creativity as death narrates. Also so interesting to read a story from the perspective of a non Jewish German person in WW 2.
B00EV4EUT8|5.0|THE BUTLER is a film which, for all its sentimental tone, nonetheless addresses the fundamental issue of civil rights, and whether the reforms of the Sixties have actually had the desired effect.  It centers on the life of Cecil Gaines (Forrest Whitaker), who grew up on a plantation but spent most of his career in service at the White House.  To his son Louis (David Oyelowo), Cecil is nothing more than a representative of &#34;Uncle Tom&#34; culture, spending his life in willing thrall to the white man.  On the other hand Cecil manages to provide for his family and carve out a career; it is only late on in his life, when President Ronald Reagan (Alan Rickman) offers him an opportunity to savor something that he has never previously experience, that he understands how little his masters have changed, ideologically speaking, since the days of racial segregation.  This is the film's &#34;aha-moment&#34; - from then on Gaines devotes himself to the cause of equal rights.  THE BUTLER brings out the ambiguities of the African American experience; how Gaines' life might be regarded as a form of &#34;liberation,&#34; despite working for a succession of white Presidents; and how the Civil Rights cause (as symbolized by the Black Panther movement of the Sixties and Seventies) might not have necessarily aided the African American experience.  The film contains a clutch of memorable performances: Oprah Winfrey is quite admirable as Gaines' wife Gloria, supported by Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr., in supporting roles.  Whitaker is quite simply brilliant in the title role; he ages gracefully while always sustaining his self-respect.  If he does not get Oscar-nominated for his performance, I'd be extremely surprised.  A memorable cinematic experience.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|Perhaps expectations were too high, but I was initially very disappointed with the album. It doesn't help that Gaga herself hyped it up as the album of the millennium or something to that effect (if what I read about her saying that was true). At this point though, after having listened to it more, the album HAS grown on me! And I like it a lot more than I initially did.<br /><br />AURA is a sick pop song, there's NO denying that.<br /><br />VENUS grew on me more than any other song. At first I thought it sounded cheap and tacky, but then I just realized it sounds 80's... but GOOD 80's! It's glossy production and slightly campy yet fabulous lyrics save it from feeling like a cheesy, dated pop song from the 80's. It's a great dance song in a very atypical way by today's dance music standards.<br /><br />G.U.Y. sounds good (even though at times it sounds like a video game) and dark, like Gaga's best previous material off of The Fame Monster and Born this Way (Bad Romance, Judas, Monster, Government Hooker) and even recalls The Fame's 'Lovegame' with its aggressive, dark dance beat.<br /><br />SEXXX DREAMS is where the album veers off course. Like Venus, it sounds 80's or even 70's, which I can appreciate, but there's nothing sexy about sounding like an old porno from the 70's. NEXT<br /><br />JEWELS & DRUGS is THE WORST song she's ever recorded. It's so horribly out of place, forced and cringe worthy. I don't care if this is her artpopmusic experiment, it is like torture to my ears. It totally brings the album down.<br /><br />MANiCURE jumps back into how Gaga should sound, but coming after Jewels & Drugs is also not a good transition for the album, and it's an uptempo song but ultimately uninspiring.<br /><br />DO WHAT U WANT is decent and it's nice to see Gaga sing different styles but the song feels out of place on the album. I love R&B, but this song is nothing truly interesting or groundbreaking.<br /><br />ARTPOP is the most interesting sounding song on the album. It almost brings to mind Vogue by Madonna with it's enigmatic, urban pulse and fabulously artsy, potentially pretentious lyrics; this song does the album's concept the most justice, go figure. Yet, the other songs that surround it are so bizarre and don't seem to relate to Gaga's apparent artistic template for this album.<br /><br />SWINE is a perfect example of the bizarre lack of cohesion on the album, coming after ARTPOP, it sounds ridiculous. On it's own though, it is a great dance song, although it can get quickly tiring.<br /><br />DONATELLA sounds fresh and exciting, but is tarnished by simply vapid lyrics! Peraps there really is nothing more to Donatella Versace and the fashion world after all.<br /><br />FASHION!-- It's cool that it kind of sounds like vintage Gaga, before she was famous, but why do we need another song about fashion? It's hardly a new spin on the topic.<br /><br />MARY JANE HOLLAND and DOPE drag like molasses. They're nowhere near as good as YOU AND I or THE EDGE OF GLORY.<br /><br />GYPSY & APPLAUSE end things right, on a high note but the album does not have ANY cohesion throughout.<br /><br />Definitely a step down from Born This Way which was an exceptional album with no filler and meaningful content.<br /><br />Sad about the wasted potential that this album presented with Applause, Artpop, Aura... Hopefully her next album is a little less DADA (A European artistic and literary movement (1916-1923) that flouted conventional aesthetic and cultural values by producing works marked by nonsense, travesty, and incongruity.)and a little more cohesive in it's artistry.

B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Well acted and interesting but a somewhat unplausible ending diminishes the film. I enjoyed the characters and even the romance. Denzel always does a good job.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is exciting and challenging!! The way items are hidden and it consist of numbers and color codes. I can play this game all day! Can't wait for the other levels so please don't keep me waiting!!!
0811879542|5.0|Oh my gosh...what a great book! My kids were literally belly laughing hard by the end of this book! What a creative and unique idea! This author should be praised for coming up with a totally new concept for a book. My children range in age from 2-7 yrs old, and they all love it! At the end of the book, it asks if they want to do it again from the beginning, and all four shouted &#34;yes!&#34; in unison...<br /><br />It's very simple and only consists of dots and a few black pages, but we all love it...I had to read it three times in a row when we got it in, and I foresee it being a frequently requested one each day...<br /><br />This is an author we'd never heard of, but I'm so glad we found this particular book...it's a hit!
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I just can't believe this album won Best pop vocal album on grammy last years... love it, slay kelly vocally :)
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Best book I've read in years!!!  Language, structure, characterizations, dialogue -- all superb!  My nomination for all the literary prizes to be given.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Every time I read a book by bill Bryson, I think, &#34;He can't do better than this! &#34; Then I read another book by Bryson and say the exact same thing. He is the best. This is a great book. Read it and learn something about yourself!
015206396X|4.0|Graceling is a modern throwback to the fantasy books of the 1980s and 1990s - a straightforward story, relatively low key romance, and complete lack of over the top heroines and too-modern-sounding teens.  But at the same time, some of the more frustrating YA staples are here: adults are evil and the guys all have a case of insta-love on our heroine. But it is decently enough written to keep me entertained with the Audible version.<br /><br />Katsa is a graceling - blessed with an ability (in her case, ability to kill easily) that marks her as different.  Her uncle, the king, uses her as his personal enforcer, sending her out to hurt those who displease him.  On one such trip, Katsa encounters a young man, a prince from a neighboring country, and after that, their fates will be entwined as she must learn to use her abilities compassionately and not as her Uncle's thug. But he has a secret grace and she will be drawn into politics of the world on a grand scale.<br /><br />This is a stand alone though there are two other books in this same world (one a prequel of sorts and the other a sequel but both with different characters). I did feel the book floats around quite a bit and lacks a good solid structure.  As well, it can get tiring hearing Katsa echo the same thoughts over and over.  Yes, we get the idea you don't want to marry.  No, we don't need all the guys falling all over you even though you're supposedly deadly.  And yes, we have a hero who is once again just a bit too good to be true.<br /><br />I would probably rate this around 3.5 stars.  It's nice to see a return to more traditional fantasy (rather than the ubiquitous YA urban fantasy) but at the same time, I wish the characters were a bit more distinct and multilayered.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I cant believe I didn't play it sooner! I love it! It may take me awhile to figure out strategies though! I was also amazed at how many of my friends play it too!
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Excellent movie! So much action and amazing views of New York City. Keeps you wondering until the very end! Excellent overall
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|People who want the same standard old Superman legend may not accept this but it's very well done.  Adds to the same old legend.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I have to agree with the 500+reviewers...  got it from the library and 60 pages into... lost interest. I had to find out what the hype was about...which was nothing.  If I see another description of bitting her lip I am going to scream.  I am so glad I waited.
031623480X|5.0|For anyone interested in health through nutrition, this book contains eyeopening insights based on scientific studies.  So many currently accepted concepts of what is a \\"healthy\\" diet are turned upside down. I highly recommend it to everyone, because \\"we are what we eat.\\"  Diagnosed diseases can be reversed by changing what you put in your mouth. The book is well written, easy to understand and very compelling.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|The picture quality is stunning and my daughter has enjoyed the extra features in the Blu-Ray.  I would definitely purchase again.
B001974DG0|5.0|I know this book is old from some of the anachronisms that appear because of the Incredible advances in technology that have been made in the last thirty years, but that didn't keep me from becoming totally absorbed by this wonderful tale. I'm almost afraid of reading more of the authors' work for fear of being let down. I'm sure that I've read other books of his, but l can't recall being this affected before. Perhaps it's because it's because I'm an animal lover, or because we live in paranoid times, but this book is one I will remember fondly for a long long time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great love it! My daughter loves to play this game.  Easy to play but has a lot of different task.
B00CM9JL4S|5.0|After two decades of brilliant yet relatively obscure progressive ethnic death metal, OL has finally stepped onto the world's stage with their most accessible release to date musically and certainly their most compelling lyrically. In essence, All Is One is a plea for peace between Muslim and Jewish people primarily, and all rival nations in general.  More stripped down this time - perhaps for clarity of message - the songs remain upbeat, worshipful and percussive. As with everything this band crafts the symphonic, choral and folk elements are perfectly blended with the metal. Kobi opts for all clean vocals with the exception of the riff-heavy \\"Fail\\" where the death vocals cut through with conviction. In doing so, they've sacrificed nothing from the quality of original metal their fans have come to expect, yet these songs are more direct, concise. Furthermore, with an unprecedented credibility - like no other band in the history of metal has had in the Middle East - they've thrown down the gauntlet to all nations for peace and unity.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Read it before you watch the movie. It's a great book and certainly more detailed than the movie. The whole family loved reading it.
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|I'll give it 4 stars because, while Gaga is supremely talented, I don't think we've seen her best work yet.  I prefer Born This Way to this album.<br />To me there are a couple of sequels here:<br />&#34;Gypsy&#34; is &#34;Edge of Glory&#34; part II<br />&#34;Dope&#34; could be the fallout of &#34;Bad Romance&#34; or just the stripped down truth after &#34;You and I&#34; did not work out.....or maybe they are a trilogy?<br />Anyway, I am waiting for something more.....something more like the piano-only version of &#34;Hair&#34; that I heard on Howard Stern's show.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have this game on my computer and it is a great stress reliever. Now I have it on my Kindle Fire. haven't tried it yet. I got 2 other games the same time. See if it syncs with my computer time. I am at 181 there. I would hate to start all over again. Ain't going there.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Very convenient, we love these, my husband and I bought one of different colors for our kindle fire, we love them, they're sturdy and fits perfectly into my purse. Would definitely recommend.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Like most games by King, this game is challenging. But it is also fun. My only issue with this game is the fact that there are times when it seems to be a little to touchy. Meaning it will shoot the bubble before I am ready sometimes. Plus, at times it does seem a little to challenging...but that I know is part of the game.

B00AEBBA72|5.0|One of my favorite Halloween movies ever!  Love Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.  Great classic story that never gets old.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|it is a very fun and complicated game for people of all ages. my only complaint is that if you lose five times in a row, you have to wait another twenty minutes to keep playing
B009HUB40Y|5.0|passes time away quickly<br />very easy game to learn a lot like bejewled even kids would like it would keep the mind busy
B0030B621W|4.0|great movie. what's amazing about this movie is that it's managed to capture a great deal of emotion with a very limited cast. Sam Rockwell is the only actor visible in most of the movie and he carries it with great skill. Think of a lighter version of Tom Hanks in Cast Away and the daunting task of carrying a movie mostly by yourself. As much as I like Sam Rockwell as an actor I feel like he wasn't able to fully capture the awkward nature of the situation he was facing at times. Perhaps it's a hole in the script more so than the actor. But I was pleasantly intrigued by the concept of the whole story. Thought provoking.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Love this game on all the platforms I have it on.  The updates hurt.  Usually I'll see an update in the Google Play store and then I'll see one in the Amazon App store.  However, the latest round only shows the Play store update.  And if you make the mistake of installing that update, You'll gave to uninstall and then reinstall from the Amazon store.  I've gotten to the point of not trusting any of the updates.
B00BATG18K|5.0|This was a beautifully told story, and I wish there were another 600 pages to read about love,  loss, and courtesan life.  I want to be inside all of Amy Tan's books!

0765334798|5.0|You know the guys on Star Trek who get killed in almost every episode? This is their story.<br /><br />Ensign Andrew Dahl signs aboard the Intrepid, flagship of the Universal Union Space Fleet.<br /><br />Dahl and his friends quickly learn that something is going on aboard Intrepid ... something bad. The ship has a huge fatality rate, especially on away missions, though her senior officers (who nearly always participate in away missions) seem strangely immune.<br /><br />Things look grim for our heroes ... until they meet the mysterious Jenkins.<br /><br />That's when things get really weird.<br /><br />Redshirts made me laugh out loud more times than any book I can think of except Donald Westlake's classic Dancing Aztecs. Almost all that laughter was in the first half, because the book gets gradually more serious. Both the silliness and the seriousness are organic to the story, which is quite an achievement.
1932100660|5.0|This is the best book ever on good nutrition.  It gives lots of research for those who want scientific studies to counter the drug company claims.  It exposes the &#34;dark side&#34; of medical schools, pharmaceutical companies and our own government in misleading the American people as to the importance and what is good nutrition.
B00COQU0D0|5.0|I just read The Great Gatsby for the first time. I am 60 years old. What a tour de force. I also read Hemingway's memoir<br />A Moveable Feast-He knew Fitz and Zelda and it was interesting to see his take.<br />Baz Luhrman can do no wrong. Fabulous! The music was divine inspiration.
1572816295|5.0|the art work is brilliant, and the size of the cards makes them easy to work with. they aren't too large but aren't too small. as a tarot reader myself i recommend this deck! the cards may seem a bit soft and child-like in nature but essentially it tells you the hard truths, it gets to the point and is extremely clear for me in my readings.

B00F880BWG|5.0|This series is easily one of the best on TV especially now that Breaking Bad is over. The writing, editing and producing of WD is just fantastic. Forget the zombie apocalypse, the character development is moving. My wife who abhors zombie genre movies watched a few episodes with me. She thought the characters were compelling even if the zombies were not on her list of &#34;things to watch&#34;.<br /><br />The challenges faced by the prison group this season are plausible, well developed and very entertaining to watch.
B0090SI582|4.0|It is better than the first movie, I like the movie it is very good. I wound watch it again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Lovable characters with lots of good life lessons.  Good read for teens and young adults. Looking forward to the movie.

0812550706|1.0|It's not always easy to tell the good guys from the bad guys in this world, but Orson Scott Card is clearly a sick creep.  Now that his movie is dead in the water, it's time to start boycotting the books.  Fight religious fascism.  Boycott Card.

B0086700CM|4.0|Made me a nervous wreck!!! I had fun playing the easier levels, but had to give it up after a little while to maintain my sanity.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I liked this case, but the only thing I had an issue with was the bulkiness and the screen cover.  The bulkiness kept it from easily going in my pants pocket, and the screen cover was annoying at times cause it kept my phone from really working well when it came to texting.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Really liked the movie and the characters, but wishes it was fifteen v or twenty minutes longer. The ending was too abrupt and I wanted more!
0385484518|5.0|This is a wonderful book that can truly teach you so much about life! I got this book for my english class, and I plan to keep in and read it again later in life to remind myself how precious our life is and how important it is to love everyone around you. &#34;You learn to live, once you learn to die.&#34;
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|I had to return for a refund after only a few chapters. Not something I could leisurely read. It would of had to of been an assignment for a college class and then maybe I could have forced myself to plod through it.

B003G4W49C|4.0|Ender's Game is thoughtful and interesting the whole way through. I enjoyed the book quite a bit. There were some times I felt a little lost or couldn't quite believe kids, even as smart as these kids, would use words like hegemony, but overall it was a book I enjoyed.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A very good read. Complete evolvement with a loving family! What struggles were faced with protecting their son. Sometimes your will cannot predict the outcome.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|I watched this movie years ago and liked it very much. Recently, it popped into my mind so I decided to watch it again and I enjoyed it even more than I had originally. It's an excellent western with some major stars...
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It was an incredible read.  Chris will be missed by many! I read this a year or so before he was murdered.  How sad.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|This may be the best Bond yet.  I rank Daniel Craig up there with Sean Connery.<br />I hope he continues to make these movies.  These movies are standing on a thrilling story line, not just on gadgets and sex.  Loved it!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a neat little game, I'm on level 9. Interested to see what the other levels offer, how the game progresses.

B0053O89XI|5.0|What can I say? If you like Big Bang Theory you'll like the DVD set. I would recommend the set.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|An engaging story from a very bad author.  The story has its merits but the author is just plain bad.  The author does not know their own characters...they leave details out and forget completely other details that they have now completely contradicted.  This could have been so much more of an epic fantasy story and the author turns it into dribble.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Total time suck. My poor neglected chores and children. I may have to amputate my thumbs for any thing to get done. It's a wonder I stopped to write this.
B003UYV08E|4.0|Iron Man 2 sold out tickets to several simultaneous showings during its opening night in the town I lived. With the original Iron Man having taken its place among the best superhero films ever made, and Disney/Marvel's ambitions leaving no margin for error, I thought the era of crappy follow-ups was well and truly dead. It just seemed like the oversights and flaws that led to them had been done away with by the same increasingly efficient film design that gave us Iron Man. Subsequent releases in the Marvel cinematic universe would show this belief to be hit and miss at best. I was not the only one who walked out of that theater feeling slightly duped.<br /><br />Years later I still have little doubt Iron Man 2 was a crappy follow up. The story was padded with extraneous Shield-related plot threads which detracted from the development of the relationships that had been established in 1. Tony's character was on a hamster wheel, Mickey Rourke was under utilized as the leading antagonist, and the secondary villain was another smarmy business rival in the military industrial complex (this time on steroids). Rather than earning his salvation, it seemed as though Nick Fury rode in on a white horse and gave Iron Man the tools he needed to survive and flourish a superhero (deus ex machina). The mounting tension that came from Tony keeping his impending death secret from Pepper throughout the film was anti-climatically dissolved in a spare scene as we were rushing to the climax.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, repeat viewings have revised my opinion to one more positive. There are two primary reasons, one of which has to do with the development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe itself. &#34;Extraneous Shield-related plot threads&#34; obtruded on Iron Man 2's plot on release, but even the mediocre aspects of the Marvel Cinematic Universe work better when they draw on the larger background and dramatic force that bring the meta series together. Scenes and characters that were cringe worthy at the time can now be enjoyed as clever tie-ins. Their presence here &#34;makes sense&#34; in light of Avengers. In this way the thrills of the Cinematic Universe are not too different from the actual comics. In that respect, Iron Man 2  &#34;reads&#34; like a comic book in a way feel films have ever brought to the screen.<br /><br />The second reason is that elements that felt underwhelming only seemed so in light of Iron Man 1. As a continuing story, Iron Man 2 is a complete misfire. Once the protagonist has achieved self-realization in the first entry, the plot should shift focus to a select number of theme-serving relationships and external conflicts. But in addition to the fact the original film's relationships were displaced by the addition of the Shield-plot characters in 2, they also had to deal with the added weight of Tony's renewed existential crisis. I found this continuing focus so annoying that I never stopped to appreciate how well handled it was in terms of the movie's own internal events and logic. Greatness? Not quite, but impressive in light of how crammed the movie was with extraneous characters and plot threads. If more emphasis could have been replaced on Tony/Venko's rivalry and their relationship with their fathers, then this might have been a great stand-alone superhero film from the emotional resonance of that conflict alone. As it is, it can only be described with words like &#34;good&#34;, &#34;effective&#34;, and &#34;enjoyable.&#34;<br /><br />So overall Iron Man 2 is a good film in a terrible sequel that showed further worth post-release simply in terms of how it helped developed the larger events of meta series of which it forms only a small part. Interesting, if nothing else.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|No issues so far & it charges my phone really fast! Love the dual-port & how sleek it looks. Although an indicator light would be nice since I was so used to my old one.
B003XMXZCW|5.0|This is a great movie.  Lots of action.  One bombing scene if you have a good surround sound system makes it sound like you are there with the jets going by and the bombs going off.  Good movie all around.
0545265355|5.0|I read the trilogy in 7 days.  I loved these books.  The characters were fabulous.  It's past paced, tense and I cried when Rue died.  The Hunger Games Trilogy were better than Lord of the Rings.  I wish Collins would write a series 2 of the Hunger Games.
B002OFWG7O|5.0|Every  song on this album is great to listen to.  You don't always get that even when it says greatest hits.  You do with this one.  Every Foo Fighter fan should own it.  It even comes with a DVD. What a deal.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I am enjoying this game so far.  It's your typical farm and build type game.  Pretty graphics, nice sound.  Not too slowly paced so that's nice.  Runs smooth on my kindle fire HD.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great way to pass the time. Fun quests and the stuff doesn't take too long to complete. I would recommend it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game. Really like it. Only gave 4 stars because run out of energy too fast. Still worth downloading though.

B00G922EA2|3.0|great game with a good story and colorful graphics. The dialogue was 50/50 but overall enjoyable. I feel that it is however definitely not worth $4.99.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive and fun!! I enjoy this game very much,level 14 is hard, that's all my worrys. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It keeps me entertained especially now,I'm sick so it's easy to be having fun being sick.

0756686970|5.0|Great gift for for Star Wars and LEGO fan in one. Maybe it should be also available to eReader or tablet.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|It is incredible to go to the store to buy a new Beatles record. It made me feel I was back to the sixties. Besides, and most important, the CD is quite good.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Great show, great writing and acting. If you want to watch a good spin-off, watch Torchwood. You will not be disappointed.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is so much fun as you challenge yourself to go to each level. The harder the level the more exciting it is when you complete it! I must warn you though that it is truly addictive!  I Love this game!
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Went to work with only an hour and a half sleep since I NEEDED to finish it that same night. I couldn't wait to see how it ended. I would love to see this turned into a movie!  Favorite John Green book. I need to read it again but take my time and savor it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once you start this, you won't want to put it down.  The horror at the way this government treats it's citizens continues to amaze!
B0076XIS4O|5.0|My introduction to Grimes was watching the music video for &#34;Genesis.&#34; I didn't know what to make of it -- the dreamy lyrics, the fantasy video game-ish props and characters. But pretty soon, I couldn't get the song out of my head. I downloaded the full album the next day and have listened to it over and over in the last 72 hours. I just can't get enough! Looking forward to listening to her other albums.
B00CHCUR9I|4.0|Read the original classic comic book that started The Walking Dead phenomenon. This is the original issue #1 by Robert Kirkman on which the pilot episode for the hit AMC TV series was based. While the pilot followed this storyline pretty closely, episodes diverged quite a bit from the comics as the series progressed. This is the perfect jumping on point if you want to see Kirkman's original treatment for the saga of Rick Grimes and his entourage as they fight to survive the zombie apocalypse. Chock-full of horror, suspense, romance, and the gripping drama that set it apart from other zombie stories, The Walking Dead is a real winner. This epic series truly has heart... and brains. I recommend following up with the graphic novels, rather than the individual issues, to save a few bucks.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Was looking for a good app for downloading Youtube vids, bummer that soon as you start a download up comes &quot;for $1.99....&quot;  App now has been deleted....

B007T8BYWE|5.0|This is so much fun and addictive.  It is nice to do a game (puzzle) that you have to think to play it.  I want all of them!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Delicately written, the narrator, Death, slowly draws the reader into the lives of ordinary German citizens struggling to survive a world that is cruel, complex and catastrophic.  Against our own prejudices,  the reader comes to care about the central characters and to develop grudging admiration for their willingness to risk everything by individual acts of defiance that challenge the totality of Nazism<br /><br />A different perspective of the horror of World War II.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works great and allows me to download books to read without having to go the the library, or pay expensive prices at book stores.
B004SZVWUU|5.0|[Dutch Release] Loved the movie though it takes repeated views to appreciate. Product from DaaVeeDee, though described as region code B played fine on an Oppo BDP-105 (not region free). Nothing on the disc box says anything about region encoding. The disc is PAL encoded from the Netherlands, but that is not a problem for this player. Language of film is English. You can turn off the optional Dutch or French subtitles. The supplements are in a mix of French and English, with no English subtitles. This is not a major problem for most of the supplements.
B009NY43NY|2.0|This is my first bad review for a book in this series. It mainly felt like someone else wrote this. The characters' personalities were different. it just kind of fizzled out at the end.<br /><br />I felt like I had to read it because I have already invested time and money into the series, but I honestly feel a little bit ripped off by this last book.<br /><br />I was sad to hear that the series was going to end, but now I understand if there was just no story left. I wish I didn't have to spend almost $12 to find that out...<br /><br />I can't believe people were mad about who Sookie ended up with. After reading this book does anyone really care??
B009AY04A8|4.0|I dont do much game playing.  Although small on my Kindle Fire, I like the graphics and the story line.

B00F1CRSKM|5.0|Arrived on time and Arcade Fire is a great band. Every single record is a new experience with new elements on it. Reflektor is a great experience about  Arcade Fire experience in Haiti.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|With all that is happening in America ,I agree with this documentary because it is true what problems we have here with health care, compared to other countries health care . Why can we not have a health care like Germany or Canada or elsewhere instead we have greed  no wonder we have the problems we do like nowhere else. This show is interesting and sad how it is in our nation with health care ,if anything a disgrace .Highly recommended .
B000YDE46Y|3.0|The color is completely different as showed in the picture, is lightly brown. When I requested my exchange I remarked the color issue but no body read it. Amazon is a great company but needs to be more efficient than fast.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|It was boring and did not read much of it. Usually I like John Grisham but not this one. Thanks  (do not know what u mean &#34;headline required&#34;)
B008JFUPK8|5.0|A fantastic movie with a perfectly cast Henry Cavill and Russel Crowe.  Kudos to Zack Snyder for taking a chance on one of the most popular superheros of all time.  Told from a different perspective, this movie is full of both emotion and action.
B00DBISUWS|5.0|Amazing vocals, arrangements, song writing, beautiful orchestration with just enough edge to keep it from sinking into oblivion. It's rare to find all of this in one album. The tracks have a nice variety to them that transitions thoughtfully from one to the next and leaves you wanting for more. To me, Allison Goldfrapp is one of the leading indie musician of our time.
B0088IPBGY|5.0|Everyone knows Layla, but this album is deep with classics like Bellbottom Blues, Keep on Growing, and Why Does Love Have to be so Sad? The album is Clapton's best of his career due in large part to the collaboration with Duane Allman.
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|I love Arcade Fire, I love their connection to Haiti but...<br />There are only a few stand out tracks on REFLEKTOR, a few other tracks worth listening to and a lot of in between stuff that just doesn't come together in any interesting or even challenging way. Only Lou Reed (R.I.P. Lou, you're a god!) can get away with minute upon minute of dead space between cuts. Arcade Fire has not done nearly enough drugs to claim that space. And let's face it this is 2013, not 1972. Could have easily been one CD and saved the world a bunch of plastic. Download it, kill the filler material and you'll be happy!
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This game is a fun spin on all the water games out there. Instead of water running, you have grains of sugar spilling down which behave slightly differently than water. Several people in our extended family have enjoyed playing it on Kindle Fire - from a 5-year-old up to an almost-70-year-old. Great game!
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Best. Movie. Ever.  If you don't count Shaun of the Dead or The World's End.  And it said I needed more words, I don't know why.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It was really awesome then we'll a month or so later it wouldn't play anything it would freeze then say ytube has stopped.. I would get it and like it while it lasts ;-)
B00AEBBA72|5.0|Its a older movie but i love it.If you're  fan of the story this is a nice twist on the classic telling.The acting was wonderful and story exciting.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|this has to be one of the most amazing movies i have seen, it touch me so much!! specially the end OMG i cry like a baby!! it was an awesome movie, the little boy its a great actor.
1401937519|3.0|The story is a 10 star story and everyone should know this story. I read it first on NDERF dot org and never forgot it. But it is not a book. To make a book out of it necessitated Mrs Moorjani repeating herself for each chapter. In the end the repetition dilutes the simple beauty of her phenomenal remission. The three stars is a comment on the publishing industry which requires authors to pad products relentlessly to make them book length, and not the author whose writing skills are top notch. IMHO it should have been the lead story in a collection, for there are many wonderful near death stories that have not been published very few of which have enough detail to make into a book. So it is five stars plus for Mrs Moorjani's efforts, no stars for the publisher. Terrible cover by the way... it should have been a color picture of her beautiful face which reflects her remarkable experience.

B00BEF1AEK|4.0|Lob rocks at helicopters and tanks. A slightly different take on the physics based destruction games like angry birds. Good, easy game play.
B008A36R2Y|1.0|This is a counterfeit product.  The board color is off, the silkscreen doesn't match the Arduino website's reference, and the 501k chip is green instead of gold.
B00902AKK4|5.0|A simple game that is easy to get into, but the levels get much much more challenging as you progress.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Love movies and this genre is one of my favorite !! It is fun, exciting and great entertainment for me !!
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|Starts as a simple game with logical rules, but gets more challenging as the levels progress. Can be tough to beat, but you get lots of chances for hints.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I enjoy playing it. Works well on my kindle fire. Glad I have something to post while bored at work lol
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I enjoyed the FB game but it crashed a lot. So far so good. I am enjoying the characters from the FB game as well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|When I got to the end, I was disappointed that it was over! Easy to catch on to how to solve the puzzles and move onto each new levels!!
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The story itself was very engaging and the characters well-fleshed out. I enjoyed the two different voices of Park and Eleanor despite my reservations. I've noticed sometimes when authors switch between two characters from chapter to chapter you can't always distinguish between the characters. Rowell has no problems on this account. Park and Eleanor had very different voices and thoughts. I liked how their relationship progressed from friendship to romance. It was refreshing to have snappy dialogue. Eleanor is no wall-flower rather she is an endearing sarcastic strong girl. Park has some inner strength, but generally has a gentle spirit. And they actually had similarities which I loved! I liked hearing their thoughts and enjoyed the shift. Their back-stories were good and intriguing. It explained their personalities and added a great deal of depth to the story. For a romance, well-done! However, I cannot and will not recommend this book for three reasons. The first: the language. While I was able to read through it and generally ignore it, I refuse to give it to somebody else knowing there are over twenty f-booms in there (and I am being very moderate!). I enjoyed the story and will reread it. But it bothers me greatly that the author used such foul language so continuously. I understand she was trying to create a high school setting, but it is poor taste and a lack of creativity in my opinion to use such foul language to do so. There are other better ways to create that sense than fouling up a beautiful story with the same nasty words again and again! The second reason is some of the way the physical romance was handled. While I thought it was far more tasteful than other modern stories, I did not like how close it edged to the line. I don't mind if sexual activity or attraction is implied or quickly described. Yet she danced a little closer to describing it than I would have liked to see although that is a minor problem. If it were simply that, I would wholeheartedly recommend it.  The final reason: I am not entirely sure how appropriate the book is for everybody. Richie, Eleanor's stepfather, is a very twisted individual. He is physically abusive to her mother. He also attacks Eleanor using writing but it would spoil an important point in the story to tell exactly how so I won't. Overall, the story was fascinating and enthralling. It made me think and I couldn't put it down. It's unfortunate that this author had to multiple curses (f-word, s-word, d-word for a start) to tell her deeply thought-provoking story.
B00F5FBE82|4.0|Good album.  I feel like his first three albums were superior though.  His first two definetly had more effort in the lyrics.  Still enjoy it though.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Reza Aslan focusses on hard evidence to highlight the schism between practices of Christianity for the past 1600 years and historically factual data. Surprisingly in the first few centuries following the death of Jesus (the physical person who lived and preached in Jerusalem), there is scant authoritative information available. Connecting the dots after twenty centuries is tough slogging and what emerges from Reza’s research is a fascinating account of how Jesus’s original teachings morphed into contradictory dogma that became sacred with centuries of practice and is now immune to honest intellectual discussion. In matters of faith, emotion often trumps logic and reason. The author’s personal background and experience offers a unique perspective but may be mistaken for bias.<br />Almost 40% of the book is notes and references which I found to be redundant. Overall an enjoyable read!
B00FMJJ064|5.0|Watch her on youtube too! She does a dance routine for most of her songs as well, they're as interesting as the songs themselves.
B00BEIYMTW|3.0|Very disappointed. Of all the Pixar movies, this one leaves  a lot to be desired.  It was mediocre at best.  One scene found in the bonus features, the musical scene of Franz should not have been cut from the final film, it would have added more fun to the overall movie.  My grandchildren and all adults in the family watch the other Pixar movies over and over. Planes does not hold the attention of  the targeted audience as the other Pixar films do and do not see this one as being a favorite among the family.  After all the hype and delays on the release of the movie, very disappointed with the final film.  I hope the additional Planes trilogy improve in the overall movie content.  Cars, and Cars II for instance has been watched so many times in my home by the Grandchildren, we have had to order two additional copies as the DVD's just wore out due to numerous scratches by the children, but had no problem in replacing them as they are enjoyable favorites.  Also do not understand why Pixar cuts the scenes from the final films that are used in the clips advertising the new movies coming out?  Those are the scenes as to why a movie is decided by families to go to the movies or purchase the DVD's.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Perfect ending to the series!  Any book that makes me cry is powerful!  -  And this one did it to me!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Awesome show - humorous & crisp writing.  Each scenario brings a continuing theme, yet new plots.  Characters are refreshingly bold.
B000I8G594|5.0|This is a world classic movie. Al Pacino and Johnny Depp would deserve an oscar both for such a perfect performance!<br />Al Pacino intensity is unbelievable , Johnny Depp capacity of acting a double life ( the mafia guy and the nice husband ) is<br />astonishing.<br />I also loved Michael Madsen impersonification of Sonny .... fantastic acting!<br />Great movie , great story, greatest acting, and greatest shame on the academy award judges of that year for not having chosen<br />this fantastic movie.<br />what were they thinking ???
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I was happy to see that you could finally download CCS on Kindle.  Had seen so many people absorbed in it.  I personally don't like that you can't keep playing game without additional purchases.  Waiting time between games ridiculous.  But it can become addictive.  Will probably only pick up at random.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It's pretty fun, but there are cons. One, you lose almost half of your coins if you die in the mining caves. The good characters are hardly affordable, and they're all the same. Like, no special powers. No nothing. And it's all for what? Running around endless circles and corners? It's all the same! Why have a second version if it's gonna be just like the first? Even though this game is free, I wasted my time with it. I don't want you to suffer like I did. Apologies.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Fast paced game to keep you busy when you have some time to kill.  I play<br />often in between jobs.
B007QXWV1U|3.0|Your serious. Could use better customization options and scale adaptation. Worth a few bucks when you finally get it figured.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|Wonderful Western!  Gritty, witty, great dialogues, wonderful cinematography, beautiful locations.  I used to think &#34;The Outlaw Josey Wales&#34; was Clint's best western, but the story line of Unforgiven outstrips it (they're both great, though).  Gene Hackman is superb as the sadistic Little Bill.  The body count isn't as high as in &#34;Josey&#34; but Unforgiven is probably grittier and more realistic.  I've watched this more times than I can accurately recall, and I'm still riveted every time.
B00C1040TO|3.0|Very disappointed. There is no sound whatsoever from the fire. I know that there is no mic input, but expected the tone generator to work.
0767812166|5.0|I'm a fan of Jeff Bridges' acting, and think he has delivered many fine performances to the public over several decades, but this one is my favorite.  Part of it I'm sure has to do with the charm of the story itself, but really, Jeff Bridges' performance is just stellar.  He is GREAT in this movie.  I can't believe this movie isn't shown more often on cable; if I mention it to younger people (I work at a university), almost no one knows of it, and that's just sad.
006202406X|2.0|It was not even in the same ball park as the first two books in the series.  I would not recommend it.
031623480X|5.0|This book has changed my life. I am only a few weeks into changing my eating habits endorsed by this book and am incredibly surprised and happy at the changes in my body and how I feel.  Having high cholesterol and reading Cholesterol Clarity -  these two books go hand in hand - in changing my life forever. Three weeks into a completely new regime with eating and I have a spring in my step, have lost the bloat in my stomach, my brain is getting clearer, and I feel fitter than I have in years. .  and it`s early days so I am very excited to see how much more improvement I will get as I stick to the low carbs, gluten free, no sugar, and yummy fats. My insides died and went to heaven the first time I had berries with cream. It had been so long since I had cream or cheese, my poor brain and body had been starved, basically tricked through fear of the hype that the doctors and pharmaceutical companies have bombarded us with.

B004RC8NUQ|5.0|Very funny it's a must buy. For your own collection. I like this had got it from the library. Had to have it
B000SSV8HI|4.0|I am in awe of the three versions that are all included in this 'one disc' sale page !  My rating is only for the manner in which the greatest rock and roll band in the last 50 years, who releases three versions of one tour, with varying content, are all just blended into a single review zone. There is no separation of the individual releases. Trying to see what the other versions might have, that your first purchase does not.. trying to dig thru 250 reviews with mostly compliments to the Stones..is ludacris.<br /> There just may may be a problem with this style of \\"review-blending on Amazon.\\"<br />If anyone prefers to just read reviews to make decisions, they may be in for a bumpy ride when its revealed slowly, what ALL is combined into one here.<br />Many reviewers have no idea there were the two previous, longer DVD versions of the BIGGER BANG Tour, early on.<br />-Since the reviews are all scrambled  together, all under just one title (No \\"1st /4 DVD /LTD.Edition,\\" Or \\"Expanded Edition,\\" or \\"4-Disc LTD release.\\" Nothing even is said that \\"this review area is intended for the single disc\\"-- that is actually being sold HERE..<br /> Why cant the various releases, or versions be reviewed on separate review sites?  Or at least make a visual grid-style comparison. Like 'same brand PC's' or other items from the same manufacturer, with similar, varying percs or the budget version vs. the others.<br />OR, if its not possible to be more concise, we simply must take a few days to find comments on sound, or which recordings are not live, not included..etc. or even try to keep track of which release the reviewer thinks you already know she/he is reviewing. IF you need help keeping your collection from duplication or if you dont want 4 versions, maybe just one will be great. oh, maybe its just me.<br />Yes, Biggest Bang had a 4-disc set, and apparently a three-disc set, and then, what is actually being sold right here-- is the one-disc set. (what? no double-disc DVD set? /just/wait- the COMPLETE set may be yet to come.)<br />This review page, with so many releases or versions that all are on one page, may be the most confusing review zone on Amazon. ..Stones arent like other bands.. not when it comes to re-released, updated, and improved, mo-betta sound releases.  it goes on and on..for FIFTY years.<br />And this Stones Tour, also may be the most re-released DVD on Amazon. it was a big-un/<br />But, who cares. You still cant always get the version you read about here. and it may not be in the marketplace yet.  But! according to astute reviewers here, the 'famed bootleg' - still- has the best tasty parts that are still missing in the pay-for-it versions. SAD, sad, sad.  So, The Stones working WITH Best Buy (?) cant compete with their own free-share work.. again SAD SAD for both BB and MJ. Production mayhem. Maybe they should try to gather all the concert versions, (and certainly include all the boots, AND remove NON CONCERT VERSIONS), put all takes and bits on one desk, in one folder. Not employ fifty egomaniac people who dont talk to each other, but a group that talks to each other migh work. ONE boss, who is aware of the task and is UP to it. Is that too simple?<br />Its not like there was not enough room on three or four discs. Instead of improving, there is now this one disc, compressed and yes lacking.. other reviews explain what is lacking. sad sad sad<br />SIMPLE reissues are not a bad idea after all. Given this drawn-out mess. (At least its a Stones mess!) Given the massive complaints on remasters, or any other attempts to upgrade sound, maybe a simple reissue, with NEW songs, ADDDED backstage moments, and the 'One wild nite flite that was recently discovered' and accidentally added in..etc. Its not hard to imagine a DVD upgraded with more content, instead of changing the quality or shuffle. or repeating certain songs.. Many people dont buy LIVE for perfection, they buy for the experience.. and not a jumbled/cut short camera-jump-around, limited captioned release. Sound is often pretty good the first time.. its money that drives the new versions, even though the reviewers always have the key input.  Nothing is changing though. Now, we dump big tour releases into a bin..let the customers 'have at it.'<br />I heard this was considered one of their best tours, due to size, excellent sound, great staging and content.and yes, massive profits, some also went to Katrina.  I know the 1st Chicago stop went to Katrina..removed my guilt for not donating my tip-of-the-tongue ticket for Katrina. and my freeeloading pal, who promised to yell one time.  she did not. but, anyway, my first, almost close-up. So cool. draining just to watch Mick move that much, we could hardly stay standing and just SWAY.ing. what a blast.<br />what a fully, totally diverse crowd.  like everyone you ever saw in your life showed up. 8 years old to 80.<br />I saw the concert in Chicago twice. First in the spring, and then sat thru a crossfire hurricane in September at Soldier Field in the early fall, next to the bizarrely frozen Lake Michigan..With wind blowing sleet and hail sideways. In a balmy September, the Stones got a challenge. And of course, THE  Stones seemed glad to stand up and deliver. if a bit stiff from shivering! Many Chicagoans huddling behind the seating area..yet, no shortened concert, nothing but the best was put down.  So where are THOSE CLIPS --MAN?!! Did the lense freeze..thats not an excuse.

B00AC64JRW|5.0|I love the movie.(We watch ones we like over and over and over!)  I especially like movies suitable for young people with morals, examples exemplified by this family and the young man. Overcoming odds are a good subject for anybody.  Good for church youth group, family fare, anybody who loves realistic, heartwarming movies. Biographies of people in this lifetime will really relate to young persons and I think are the best ones!
0307592731|3.0|I got bored with reading it and set it aside.  So far I have gotten a little more than half way through it.  I will probably finish it when I run out of other reading material.
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|Stupid, stupid, stupid. This movie is so bad, so boring, so very not funny, not thrilling, how much more do I need to say? It shamelessly rips off several ideas from other movies. The ending is sooo ridiculously stupid, you will wretch in revulsion. Don't watch it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|As a long time King fan, this really held my interest all the way through.<br />I think the ending could have been a bit more suspenseful but I really enjoyed finding out what happened to Dan.
1250038820|4.0|I expected more.  The heart of the blog is the stories, and I know the photographer is unlikely to be able to go back and expand on the captions after the fact, but there was too much collage work here, with no captioning, and not enough substance.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it...sometimes you get stuck but then it pays off :) even got my husband addicted and we are noe battling each other!
B00FJ7YDV6|1.0|So glad I previewed this before letting grandkids see it.  Nothing more than a commercial for the $4 version.  A few pages and things to do but no child of any age would play this little amount of content more than twice.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love this series.  It's original and the writing is compelling.  If you like science fiction at all, you will enjoy this one.  I can't wait for the new season to begin!
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Good game very addicting and fun to play. Once you get the jist of the gameplay the game is very hard to put down
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Any time we go on a trip, we have one plug for 2 phones, now  we have a plug that will charge 2 phones and it charges faster than the other plugs!
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This was a beautiful and amazing book. It will remove your vale for a while. So make sure to take it in.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I hesitated about watching this quirky legal drama.  Finally watched the pilot and got hooked.  I like both characters and the legal stories are always different and intriguing.  If you like legalese, this is a good watch.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Bought this for my grandson (9th grade).  He just finished reading it (on his Kindle) and I just ordered him City of Class per his request.  Great to have books that he WANTS to read!
B00005QW4K|5.0|I love this movie! Slapstick horror at its best! I defy anyone to watch it and not pass out laughing ;) Also, if you're a fan already you will get why the cover of the DVD is so cool. If not, you'll just have to trust me.
0345410025|5.0|definitely worth buying it and teaching yourself, especially getting your loved one's of all ages from grand ma to children to adolescents to university students to improve their memory, thus grades, improvement at work you name it.<br />This book is an investment of the best kind.
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|It was an adorable story of acceptance! Would be great for your tween or teen! I would reccommend this movie!
B00F36ZHHC|1.0|I got this for my tablet, but when I tried to open it, the screen turned black and stayed that way. I don't know if it's just my tablet (although all the other apps I have work just fine) or the app. Either way, all of the other reviews are terrible. Don't waste your time on this app.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Michael Jackson's greatest effort. Beats Thriller by a mile. Features 'Will You Be There' which is probably Michael's finest moment.
031623480X|5.0|The best book on the subject. I could not put it down, I have been waiting for a book like this for ages!

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's very fun, it has a great difficulty for a game like this, and it's easy to earn money in the game.

B007SGM084|5.0|Wish there were more to read about Christian and Ana!!!!<br />Hoping for another series like this one.  Can't wait for the movie.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|the quality of the movie was great-i didnt care for the story to much-a little boring for me. not enough action
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Awesome cast. Awesome story! Dave Grohl saved a sound board that made some of the most iconic rock songs in history.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Love this movie!  My daughter thought is was pretty funny too!  Good animation. likable characters and great story line!  Just as entertaining for adults as it is for children.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Enjoyed this book.  I was able to read it rather quickly.  Victoria was lucky to finally come across a caring loving family with many twists and turns until she would let herself belong.  It would be especially enjoyable to gardeners and lovers of children.
159102594X|5.0|A deliciously dirt and blood filled story. Characters flaunt normal fantasy stereotypes and become unique. All of Abercrombie's books live in this world and other than Martin's Game of Thrones, this is my favorite place to jump into.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Harrison Ford really shines in this his forth movie appearance as Indian Jones. Yes he has still got it!  The show is great watched it several times, enjoyed it every time.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|1st book I've read from the authors and have to say I really enjoyed. It was An odd subject so I wasn't sure at first but found myself engaged in the story line.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I wanted to be able to give this 5 stars, but I couldn't.<br /><br />Overall, I found the book enjoyable and I loved being able to connect with Danny again.  His descent into alcoholism is completely understandable. I didn't find the book to be a gigantic plug for AA as some reviewers have suggested.  I was sucked into Danny's story hook, line, and sinker.  I probably would have liked more Dick Hallorann, who has always been one of my favorite King characters of all time.  Maybe the ending could have been more - upsetting...maybe the ending was a little too &#34;happy&#34; but it was still suspenseful and mostly satisfying.<br /><br />The bad guys are the reason I could not give 5 stars...they were too silly and ridiculous with very stupid names - not sure if King was trying to make them more &#34;human&#34; than his typical monsters, but they just didn't work well...they seemed too &#34;modern&#34; to be ancient evil....(how did they &#34;store steam&#34; before thermal canisters were created?  Mason jars? Wine skins?)  Maybe a little more back history on their evolution from the ancient days of tree worship in Europe to Winnebagos in I-90 would have made their story a little less contrived.<br /><br />Some of the dialogue was corny - such as when Abra said the True Knot was &#34;naughty&#34; while going over the death of the &#34;baseball boy.&#34;  She was too old to use such a word seriously in that context - as a 3 or 4 year old, &#34;naughty&#34; is really really bad. As a pre-teen - &#34;naughty&#34; is something you wink at and pretend it's really bad....  A few times I know something was *supposed* to be funny but it fell flat...that's okay too. Overall the book was well worth the read.<br /><br />I liked Dan's work in the hospice, helping people with his &#34;shine&#34; gave him a reason and a good use for this &#34;gift&#34; that could be considered a curse.  I liked that there was less foul language than in some of his other books - sure there were still some f-bombs, but not so many times that it became a turn-off.<br /><br />Overall - it's not the best King novel I've read, not the MOST satisfying - but it did get my senses tingling enough to make it a fun read.  Nowhere near as terrifying as his earlier works.some f-bombs, but not so many times that it became a turn-off.<br /><br />Overall - it's not the best King novel I've read, not the MOST satisfying - but it did get my senses tingling enough to make it a fun read.

B002HFJ77S|3.0|it took me a while to get into this one, i even had to read other reviews to make sure there was a love interest. but about halfway it started picking up, and i couldn't put it down. a bit more fantasy than other books, but almost believable at the same time.
1476734941|5.0|The wife and I have bought into this hook, line, and sinker.  I lost 15 pounds in 2 months and I'm only starting at 160 pounds, 5'6&#34;.  We expect to follow this the rest of our lives.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I really enjoyed this story! Did not realize it was set in Australia before I started reading but it was interesting to see how woman are truly the same all over. Characters are believable and endearing and I found myself surprised at who I was rooting for as the story progressed. Moriarty adds twists and points of views that you may not expect with a resolution that makes you content in the end. I would recommend!!
B000YDG5W0|5.0|I probably have a C width foot so I need to wear very thick socks for a reasonable fit.  Very pliable leather and decent sole.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I don't normally bother with reviewing apps, but I love this one and want to let the devs know. Actually, everyone in my family loves this app. I won't bore you readers with info you already have; this is a running game like Temple Run, but more fun. I love the fun power ups and content. Thanks for a great app.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It's a great way to pass the time and always has something new. I really enjoy all the different bosses
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Considering quitting this game as there is little satisfaction when stuck for weeks and months. Seems impossible to advance, despite playing fairly well, overall.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is the best show ever. You will love it if you have any kind of sense of humor!
B00FLDG42Y|5.0|it's been a long time coming - the live album to officially close chapter 5 in Rush's four decades. This makes the 11th official live album from Rush. Here they all are, in tour order:<br /><br />ABC 1974 [UK import of the show from the Agora Ballroom, Cleveland]<br />All The World's A Stage<br />Exit ... Stage Left<br />Grace Under Pressure 1984 Tour<br />A Show of Hands<br />Different Stages<br />Rush In Rio<br />R30<br />Snakes and Arrows Live<br />Time Machine<br />Clockwork Angels Tour<br /><br />This newest release is three discs of excellent material. Besides all of the CA music, we get official live releases of Grand Designs, The Body Electric, Territories, Where's My Thing, and Middletown Dreams. Granted it is always good to hear classics as well, the down side is one could be paying for Tom Sawyer for the 9th time. Although not near to the intensity heard on Time Machine, Geddy's voice is still having trouble. Though his vocals could be a deciding factor for the band's future, I would hope they continue on several more years. Next year is the 40th anniversary of the band's 1st album. Geddy stated in an interview that they will take a break next year, and that \\"there's nothing wrong with celebrating 42 years.\\" I disagree Geddy, but I sure won't begrudge you a break from the rigors of touring. How about a nice live album package of material never-before released live, such as Hemispheres? That would make a fantastic 40-year celebration release!<br /><br />Anyway, buy this album. It's a treat for fans young and old.
B000002KHF|5.0|One of the best of Van Morrison, and Van Morrison is one of the best.  Loved this album for a long time on vinyl, so got it on CD too.  Good in either medium.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is raw, honest, and the story is beautiful. The perspective the author brings is fresh and original and it's a read that will be hard to put down!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I got a new perspective on the German pilots and the reality of their war. It clarified some of my mis-beliefs about their side of the story.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I can't begin to put into words how much I loved this book.  I am so thankful that I read it.
B0016OVEYA|5.0|I read and loved the book many years ago.  This film does a great job exploring the ways government propaganda manipulates society for its agendas (do you want to know more?).  Lastly it's a beautifully realized special effects spectacular of space fleets, and intergalactic shoot-em-ups.  Don't analyze too much, just relax and enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is fun but I don't like that they get you interested then want you to pay to continue to play.  It is very addictive.  The biggest problem I have with this app is that it really does not require a lot of skill.  This game is mostly all in what hand you get dealt.  Plus, having to pay $1.99 for 3 hammers to kill certain candies is a bit much.  They should give you 10 for $1.99.  Plus the 5 extra moves purchase is bogus because if you don't use them on the level you buy them you loose them.  This is a definite money maker for the King company but I think you don't get much value.  Do yourself a favor and don't even start it.  It is very addicting but frustrating.  If they gave you a chance with each deal then I could see it but it is all in the luck of the draw.  Very little skill involved.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The author braids the characters together through a well written story that artfully weaves  the tales together. The epilogue denies the reader the chance to determine the \\"rest of the story.\\"  It seems the author tired of the task and jumped to a summation to end it for us all.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was a very strange yet very entertaining book.  I really enjoyed this book.  It kept my interest from start to finish.  It is not something I would normally read but the title intrigued me so I bought it.  I am very glad I did.  It is about time travel but also about the unnatural.  It had lots of twists and turns and excitement.  The author has a vivid imagination for sure.  I would highly recommend this book if you are in the mood for the odd.  I may look into some other books by this author.
B004J4WLB4|2.0|I personally like books that have strong characters who rise above the very difficult circumstances of their lives.  The main character in this book is broken and while her love & knowledge of flowers help her, she is still very broken at the end.  It's a downer.  I didn't like it.
B00A6SMN8I|5.0|Bought for grand daughters BD and she loves everything about it  !  Plus she can user her imagination to create different looks for the dolls.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart, quick, witty, intelligent writing and acting. Not to mention the guys are easy on the eyes. Look forward to many seasons.
B005XLN97M|5.0|This is a great Beach house and my GD loves it !  It is nice how it folds up also to save a little space on the toy shelf.
006202406X|2.0|A novel must earn its ending.  The author may have been attempting a message, but readers could drive a Hummer through the rhetorical challenges the novel faces.  From a reader's point of view, I believe Ms. Roth has promise, but she hasn't earned the stripes to carry off this resolution.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Won't stream in HD on my PC so I didn't actually get to watch it. Amazon's interface is misleading at best, awful at worst.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I used to enjoy this game on Facebook til it quit working, but now I get to enjoy it on my kindle fire hd. It has great graphics and really easy to use.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book keeps you laughing and on the edge of your seat. Love the books so far. Wanting to read more.
B0084TWN9K|2.0|I bought this book on the recommendation from our local paper.  I found it a chore to read, the only good thing was the stories were short.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|keeps my 7 year old entertained and challenged. It was easy to learn and she does not get bored when playing in the car
0802473156|5.0|This book is highly recommended for all marriages. It doesn't matter if you are a newly wed or a 30 year veteran, understanding your partner's love language is essential to building a happy marriage. This book can even helkp those who are engaged as you can never understand your partner enough. I would encourage you to revisit this book every few years to &#34;brush up&#34;.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I enjoy playing this game, lots of fun. Uses strategy along with the luck of the roll.Good down time game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Superb acting, spectacular scenery (indoors and out), on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense ... what's not to love?  I can scarcely wait for Season Four.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|Had never read it though I should have. I don't read much any more, but purchased it to be read to me. The story ends sad, of course, but the diary is so optomistic and comical at times. The person chosen to read was perfect. I will purchase it for my granddaughters who will be old enough to read/listen to it in a couple of years. History is so important for us. This is a book everyone needs to read/listen to whether you are Jewish or not.
B006LSZECO|4.0|First let me say that this was a great book.  The only part that I was not comfortable with was the ending.  It was too much of a cliff hanger.  I want to know how the marriage of Nick and Amy progressed.  Hopefully there is another book in the works to let us know this.  That being said, I loved the twists and loved seeing the development of obsession in a very sick and twisted relationsip.  Definately recommended!
B004X4R49Y|5.0|We love anything history. No wonder this won awards. My husband taught History for 39 years to junior high and high schoolers. He has a lot of historical videos. This has become one of his favorites.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|It's FFDP what else do you need to know? if you like this band you will love this, better than the last album.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I like this movie. It brings up real questions about the universe, and our preconceptions about the universe. Also if we were to meet with aliens, what type of person we would want to represent the human race. Both from a scientific and a religious standpoint.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Just an excellent book of the original story (Pillars of the Earth) taken 200 yrs. forward by the same families.  Ken Follett writes an incredible novel and I almost liked this better than the first - probably just more invested in the story by the second book.  Each can be read on its own, but reading Pillars and then this one is a great journey!
B008602KQI|5.0|Its awesome!  Can't wait for the sequel!  There's so much going on in the film and the acting is terrific.  I really enjoyed it.
1742204147|5.0|I believe, based on extensive traveling to various parts of the world, that the Lonely Planet guides are the best around. A few years ago, I took an extended tour through Asia and the South Pacific, and had a stack of Lonely Planet guides to lead the way. In Papua New Guinea, even though I grew up there and can speak the trade language, my LP guide was invaluable. Through it, I found a number of local guides and tour companies. The maps, contacts, and up-to-date information, were invaluable. PNG can be a dangerous country, and I may say, without hyperbole, Lonely Planet helped keep me out of harm's way.<br /><br />Same was true of the LP guide to Japan. I'd never been there, so I relied on it heavily. If you have been before, you will know know how complex Japan and the culture can be, even for a seasoned traveler. From Tokyo to Nagoya, and onto Kyoto and Osaka (on that first trip), I relied heavily on my Lonely Planet guide to get around. I had read other books on history and culture, of course, but the single most useful book by far was my LP guide to Japan.<br /><br />Now I've acquired the most recent, up-to-date LP guide. This time, I'm going on a journey of the mind. Coupled with a great deal of research and personal experience, I'm writing a fictionalized account of the period right after WWII. Some of my story is actually set in Japan, in the aftermath of the only atomic bombs every used in wartime. Accurate descriptions of the cities and events are essential. Once more, I will rely on my Lonely Planet guide to provide a compelling overview of the country and the nation.<br /><br />I imagine that you contemplate a trip of your own to Nippon. In that case, &#34;Lonely Planet Japan&#34; is required reading. Study it carefully. Write in the margins. Stick Post-its as bookmarks on the places you are going. Carry the guide with you. Let it sleep on your pillow. It will be your boon companion.<br /><br />Strongly recommended!
0811879542|5.0|This book is so fabulous! I know my niece will love it. I love reading it and continue to read it over and over!
B00280LYIM|5.0|This one was one of my favorites in the series. The crazy twists and turns that happen throughout the labyrinth always keep you (and the demigods) on you toes. As in the first 3 books, new gods and monsters are introduced, as well as titans. Because this book is part of an ongoing series, it is probably best to read the others first, however, Riordan does a good job of recapping the important stuff without bogging down the flow of the story that I think you'd still be able to enjoy this even if you haven't read the others first.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Peter Jackson's extended editions are always worth the wait, and &quot;The Hobbit: Extended Edition&quot; is no exception.  In addition to adding back scenes that were cut for the theatrical release (which other reviewers have mentioned), there are an amazing 3 discs of bonus coverage totaling almost 9 hours.<br /><br />Just as J.R.R. Tolkien had appendices to his books, Jackson's movies have appendices. These extraordinary &quot;making of&quot; features for &quot;The Hobbit&quot; carry on the numbering from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The extended edition release for &quot;Return of the King&quot; ended with Appendices Part 6.  So &quot;The Hobbit&quot; begins with Appendices Part 7.<br /><br />These are extraordinarily detailed glimpses into the creation of this movie from the very beginning to the very end. Long before any actors were notified, they worked on production design and concepts. Character designs and concepts. Scripts were changed right up to the day of shooting. Motion-capture was brought to new levels. Costuming and the decisions that went into it are fascinating!<br /><br />You see clips from rehearsals and clips from rushes. Clips from meetings and makeup and why this was done instead of that. Very often, they start with quotes from Tolkien, how he described something/someone, and how Jackson (writer/director/coproducer) could work off of that. Commentators include every actor and I think just about everybody on the crew, too, from the concept creature sculptor to the animation technician desperately trying to finish Azog almost right up to the day of the New Zealand World Premiere!  You will not be bored by watching these many hours of extra features.<br /><br />All features can be listened to in English. Subtitles are available in English, Francais, Espa&ntilde;ol, Portuguêse and four more languages.<br /><br />BONUS DISC 1 The Appendices Part 7:<br />A.  Introduction by Peter Jackson (2 minutes)<br />B.  A Long Expected Journey - The Chronicles of The Hobbit - Part 1 (total 87 minutes)<br />You can watch the six parts individually or &quot;play all&quot;.<br />1........Opening<br />2........The Journey Back to Middle Earth<br />3........Riddles in the Dark - Gollum's Cave<br />4........Roast Mutton - Trollshaw's Forest<br />5........Bastion of the Greenwood - Rhosgobel<br />6........A Short Rest - Rivendell &amp; London<br />Dan Hennah (production designer) on his team's 1st look at the plans: &quot;We were going to be building over 100 sets in 4 studios. I can't say we actually paniced...!&quot;<br />It's fabulous watching the rehearsals of Frodo and Gollum in the cave, with Andy Serkis in his motion capture suit and doing THAT voice!<br />Ian McKellen (plays Gandalf) remembers that when filming The Ring Trilogy 10 years earlier, he was made to look 25% larger &quot;by putting me, the larger character, closer to the camera.&quot;  But as The Hobbit is shot in 3D, that system doesn't work.<br />Alex Funke (motion control supervisor) describes how it was done for The Hobbit: &quot;The only way we can make a person bigger is to put the camera closer to him. So, effectively,[in the dinner scene in Frodo's home]  we have a camera that looks at the dwarves and Bilbo in a set built to their scale. And a camera that looks at Gandalf, on a green screen, which is 25% closer to him&quot; on a smaller scale kitchen set. Except it isn't really a set, because everything is draped in green fabric. The two cameras are synchronized, but McKellen could not hear anything on the other set. This was very disconcerting at first, and when you look at the conditions, it's amazing it works. It's touching as McKellen describes how he was so upset after the 1st day of shooting in the green-room Bag End, that he considered he'd have to leave the movie!<br />Ikhf id ursu Khazad<br />(Feel the fire of the Dwarves)<br />Nevui penim miruvor<br />(We are almost out of wine)<br />C.  The Songs of The Hobbit (36 minutes)<br />One of the most fun songs in the movie is &quot;Down Down to Goblin Town&quot;, sung by Barry Humphries as the Great Goblin. The always humorous Humphries (better known as Dame Edna!) says, &quot;It's entirely about destruction, death and torture. But, I tried to do it in a sympathetic way!&quot;<br /><br />BONUS DISC 2 continuation of The Appendices Part 7<br />A.  A Long Expected Journey - The Chronicles of The Hobbit Part 1 (total 2 hrs, 21 minutes)<br />You can watch the nine parts individually or &quot;play all&quot;<br />7........Over Hill  -  The Misty Mountains<br />8........Under Hill  -  Goblin Town<br />9........Out of the Frying Pan - The Forest Ledge<br />10......Return to Hobbiton  -  The Shire<br />11......The Epic of Scene 88 -  Strath Taieri<br />12......The Battle of Moria  -  Azanulbizar<br />13......Edge of the Wilderland  -  Pick-Up and The Carrock<br />14......Home is Behind, The World Ahead<br />15......Credits<br />Tim Wong (assistant stunt coordinator) talks about the stunt which sends Bilbo and the dwarves tumbling down into Goblin Town: &quot;The trap door stunt, which leads to the Goblin caves, was probably the most intricate and dangerous stunt that I've ever been part of.&quot;<br />Peter Jackson does a cameo in all his films.  This time he is a refugee dwarf in a long dark beard. Did you see him passing Thorin at a run?<br />Last, but not least, you are given a lovely preview of the 2nd movie, &quot;The Desolation of Smaug&quot;, including a sneak peek of Benedict Cumberbatch in his facial motion capture get-up, breathing fire (figuratively).<br />B.  Realms of the Third Age: From Bag End to Goblin Town (total 1 hour)<br />You can watch the five parts individually or &quot;play all&quot;<br />1.......Hobbiton<br />2.......Rhosgobel (Radagast's home)<br />3.......Rivendell<br />4.......The Misty Mountains<br />5.......Goblin Town<br />This feature focuses on the sets and locations.<br />Peter Jackson says at the beginning, &quot;It was important visually, with 'The Hobbit', that it feels like a slightly more idyllic time. I mean, the darkness that descends on this world in Lord of the Rings is brewing, but it hasn't yet expanded to the levels it's going to.&quot;<br />For the Ring trilogy, most of Hobbiton was made of styrofoam and torn down afterwards. And still tourists made pilgrimages. This time around, they built the Hobbit holes and structures as in real life. They are made to last. Now you really can visit a Bag End.<br /><br />BONUS DISC 3  The Appendices Part 8<br />Return to Middle Earth<br />You can watch the four parts individually or &quot;play all&quot;<br />A.  The Company of Thorin  (1 hour 10 minutes)<br />Tolkien's books don't give a lot of definition for many of the dwarf personalities. For a movie, though, each of the dwarves in the party has to have his own characteristics, which drives his costume and weapons. So it was left to Jackson &amp; Team, as well as the actors to fill everything in.  Adam Brown (plays Ori) says: &quot;This is my first movie. I thought I'd aim high!&quot;<br />B.  Mr. Baggins - The 14th Member (16 minutes)<br />Ian Mckellen, the old pro, says of Martin Freeman: &quot;His most remarkable quality as an actor is to be able, with absolute clarity, to convey that he's thinking two things at the same time.&quot;<br />C.  Durin's Folk: Creating the Dwarves (7 minutes)<br />Richard Armitage (plays Thorin) went through many mutations on his costuming: &quot;Tolkien described Thorin as having a full beard that he tucked into his belt. We have had to depart from that. I know this is controversial, because the King of the the Long Beards, people felt he should have a long beard.&quot;<br />Graham McTavish (plays the bulkier, even for a dwarf, Dwalin): &quot;I just thought that Dwalin would have names for his axes. Because he's that kind of guy. I remembered that Emily Br&ouml;nte had two dogs called Grasper and Keeper.... What an extraordinary pair of names.&quot; And they became the names of his axes.<br />D.  The Peoples and Denizens of Middle Earth (total 2 hours)<br />You can watch the four parts individually or &quot;play all&quot;<br />1........The Stone Trolls<br />2........Radagast the Brown<br />3........Goblins<br />4........Azog the Defiler<br />Sylvester McCoy plays the wizard Radagast, who's practically turned into a forest creature himself. McCoy didn't learn he had to say a spell in formal Elvish until he got on set. McCoy says, &quot;They tell me when I first arrive, and I misheard, and I thought it was Elvis.&quot; And he goes into an Elvis impersonation. He is better at the ElviSH.<br />In the book, Azog apparently dies of his injury at Thorin's hand, in the Battle for Moria. With a little artistic license, they brought him back for 'The Hobbit', lusting for Thorin's head. Manu Bennet, the actor who's motion capture was used for Azog, talks about his character: &quot;The necessary thing that Peter wanted from Azog was what we Maori call mana, the size of the guy, the spiritual strength of the character.&quot;<br /><br />Happy Readerally, with 'The Hobbit', that it feels like a slightly more idyllic time.

0141197714|4.0|One of Jane Austen’s early works, “Northanger Abbey” which was not published until after her death is both satirical and comical in its context of British literature. It pokes fun at Gothic novels of the time like Ann Radcliffe’s Gothic novel, The Mysteries of Udolpho which she mentions several times throughout the novel. The novel follows a young heroine, Catherine Morland as she transitions into adulthood and starts to find herself. She is described as not the average heroine and was never considered to be pretty in her youth. The novel then transitions to follow her as she goes to Bath with family friends and she finally has reached a level of attractiveness at this age. She meets a Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor. She becomes quite close with Eleanor and is invited by her father to come stay at their estate, Northanger Abbey, hence the title of the novel. This is where Catherine experiences all that comes with building a relationship with friends and loved ones and Austen mocks the concepts of the then-modern British society. The novel takes much of the way people viewed the world around them at that time and highlights the larger concepts that are set in place by society. Personally, I love the works of Jane Austen and this one was no exception. Her works though set during the late 1700’s and early 1800’s, still have many concepts that I can find relevant to my life and also appreciate the humor she uses when talking about society. I am a hopeless romantic at heart, I can’t deny that, so Jane Austen really gets me because her characters get the happy ending that I feel they always deserve. Plus Jane Austen does it in a way that is humorous and enjoyable to read.
B00C1040TO|5.0|This is a great idea and a very convenient way to accomplish some tricky tasks. We have a more than 100 year old grand piano, and at that age it needs tuning frequently. Rather than call out a piano tuner every few weeks I got the tools (including a dedicated electronic device) to do it myself. This app is much more convenient to use than that device, which was necessary but pretty cludgy to work with.<br /><br />This is a welcome addition to my apps, and one that will have more practical uses than many I've tried since I started following free apps of the day.
