B004DI7HZ6|5.0|JUST READ IT!  I never write reviews!  I loved this book!  It's going to kill me to wait for the next two!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0679805273|5.0|I have purchased this book on several occasions for children & young people in recognition of some of their \\"outstanding\\" accomplishments .. i.e. Honor Roll, Graduation etc... I believe it is very inspirational and encouraging .. and of course, delivers a message of pride in themselves and the many possibilities in life that lie ahead... Anyone can become the Best they can be with hard work & determination!  I highly recommend this totally clever, humorously illustrated book as a \\"special\\" gift of pride to it's recepient!...
0316056863|5.0|I just finished this and I absolutely adored it. I love Tina Fey even more than I did when I bought the book. Her voice is authentic and it really feels like she's talking to you. Fans of 30 Rock will REALLY appreciate it because a lot of the materials reminds you of the show. This is truly hilarious and I plan on getting everyone I know to read it. She's so funny but she also has really good points about things like career, growing up, having children, etc. Just a great read.
0316044695|5.0|This book was a well written account of Marcus Luttrell and his fallen comrades. I found his story to be inspiring. I recommend this book to everybody, especially the young people of today who need a real American Hero to look up to. I really enjoyed how he expressed his patriotism to our country and made it a point to single out the liberal media and there bias. His account of the rules of engagement was very troubling, i personally don't understand why our politicians would send these young men to war with so many rules...anyway Outstanding Read!!
B00005A0RI|4.0|If three and 1/2 stars were an available option, that's how I would rate this. The upgrade from three to four is due to the fact that the album is far more likeable than not. I've read the other reviews and have to agree to some extent with ALL of them. \\"Nocturne\\" is beautiful and beautifully played by everyone in the group, has too little variety and can become boring. It sets a certain mood perfectly and evokes an elegant, slightly decadent time that is long past. I've never been a 'mood music' user, but if mood music or dinner music is called for, nothing could possibly be better.  Familiar with Haden's work since his days with Ornette Coleman and Don Cherry, but preferring his \\"Haunted Heart\\", I can't fault him for continuing to do different things.  Just don't listen to it too often and you will enjoy owning it. I've given it as gifts, and everyone says they like it.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Really enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey! The writing was fast paced and engaging. I couldn't put it down. The chemistry between the 2 main characters was palpable, even when they had their clothes on ;-)  Their email banter rang very true to me as did the relationships w/the secondary characters. Really enjoyed reading how their romance grew from just the physical to \\"more\\"...    Yes, the \\"ending\\" had me screaming, of course. But that makes me even more eager for the next installment of this series!!
B003Y74KAW|5.0|I've changed a few iPhone cases and this one so far is my favorite. It has great quality and feels very comfortable in hands.
B004ZH66XO|4.0|Absolutely love this game. I've played it all the way through, each mode, about 5 times each. Just wish there were more levels, but this definitely ranks as one of my top 5 apps. Thanks dev! Give us more levels!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Having played PvZ on other devices, I jumped at the chance to have it on my phone - the game is fantastic. I have a Samsung Fascinate, and I think people with phones that have smaller screens will find the game difficult to play on their device. The load screens are VERY long. The main issue I have with the game is that it periodically crashes my phone! I will be in the middle of a level and the phone will buzz twice - which it does on a force close of an application - and then reboot itself. Progress is not saved when this occurs.
B000JIHP88|1.0|cute looking but doesnt fit on our crib.  nowhere did i see on website that it may not be compatible with all cribs.  our crib is also brand new.  the top bar of the crib where the  mobile should be mounted is either to thick (the lengthwise bars) or graded (the widthwise bar).  the box did say it may not fit all cribs but how was i to know until i tried to install it.
B001TMCBI2|5.0|The book i ordered was new and in perfect condition and arived on time and we love the book.[[ASIN:1575666286 The Gerson Therapy: The Proven Nutritional Program for Cancer and Other Illnesses]]
B004L03B3S|5.0|i found this to be a though provoking as well beautifully crafted love story.   of course as many people have already mentioned the two people involved are  half brothers. this may initially turn people off from viewing it. on the   other side of the coin i have to say director & writer Aluisio Abranches will   win you over so that you will simply view it as a film about two young people  in love. a great deal of help in this regard is the lush score by Andre  Abujamra.     the story starts out when when the two brothers are say 6 and 11. this section  occupies say the first third of the film. then there's a 15 year jump and we  now Francisco and Thomas as young adults played respectively by Joao Gabriel  Vasconcellos and Rafael Cardoso. i'm hedging the bet the director chose these  two actors for their stunning physical beauty.     the first disruption to the closeness in the relationship occurs when Thomas  is offered a spot in the Brazilian swim to compete at the next Olympics. the  down side is he'll have to relocate to Russia for the training period. during  this period they communicate via video chats on their laptops. one such chat  also includes Alexandre Tomas's father and Francisco's stepfather. Alexandre  can easily sense just from listening to the tone of his sons voices the sadness  in the separation. this is brought up again when Francisco and Alexandre meet  the next day meet for lunch at a cafe. if he had suspicions about the degree of  Francisco's sadness from the phone chat he can now see it clearly in Francisco's  eyes. i won't spoil the ending is all i'm saying.     now i'm sure everyone will agree there has never been nor will there ever be  any such thing as a 100% perfect film. so here are the two elements of the film  that confound me.     *in the beginning section of the film there are a few mentions made by adults    as to how \\"close\\" Thomas and Franciso appear to be. at one point the two boys   spend the Christmas holiday with Francisco'sfather Pedro who lives in Buenos   Aires. when Pedro brings them back home to Rio he has a talk about their   apparent \\"closeness\\" with his ex-wife with whom Pedro is still on excellent   speaking terms. i can imagine two uptight Wasp parents in Indiana having the   discussions but i can't picture it happening in Brazil. also i just don't see   how the affection they show for each other in the beginning section of the    film is so outrageous it should raise anyone's eyebrows.     *the film begins with a voice over narration by the young adult Thomas about   the day he was born and how he didn't open his eyes till the first time    Francisco came to visit to see him at the hospital. i'm guessing this is the   directors way of saying the film is a flashback of sorts. the interesting part    is is that not only is Thomas's voice over narration sparse to begin with it    ends altogether at the point Thomas goes to Russia for training.now considering   the last scene one can interpret the voice over narration two ways. a) an   older Thomas infering that while they'll always be brothers and still love   eachother he and Francisco were eventually no longer a \\"couple\\". or b) that   the narration is simply Thomas in Russia wondering why Francisco let him go so   easily to the point of wondering if they'll ever be \\"together\\" again. i go   for b) since as stated the narration ends once Thomas leaves for Russia. this   would therefore make the last scene the utterly romantic ending i was hoping    for.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|This movie is actually really great if you can understand the underlying story and pay attention...its not like a lot of movies that you can sit and dumbly watch and still understand it. Overall i give it a 4 because although i understood the movie and loved it, it was not a movie for everyone.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|I waited and waited to see this one. Seemed to have everything. 300 style action, pretty girls, awesome cinematography...but they blew it! The girls are just catty, the fight scenes are totally unbelievable and one sided, the music is awful and makes it seem like a music video (remakes of an Iggy Po and Pixies song).I kept wanting it to just be done with. The girls have four tasks to complete and by the 2nd I just couldn't believe there were two more to suffer through. Even if you're just looking for eye candy, there is just not enough of that to entertain for an hour and a half.Boring, boring, pointless.
B003UESJJC|5.0|Apocalypse Now could be labeled the \\"most difficult production ever\\". Shooting lasted 238 days, a typhoon struck the sets and Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack. And that wasn't the end of it. Coppola struggled with the ending, the overbudget, Brando's overweight, the bad press surrounding the film and much much more. I have to say that I deeply admire Coppola for making this film and fight all the demons. He ended making a masterpiece and one of the best war films ever made. This was his last truly great film that will make him be remembered forever. Never again he had achieved the level of success that he had on the 70s with his four films (The Godfather, The Conversation, The Godfather part II and Apocalypse Now) but that's fine because this four films are among the finest of cinema history.<br /><br />As you may know, Apocalypse Now is set in Vietnam during the Vietnam War where a captain named Willard is sent in a mission to \\"terminate with extreme prejudice\\" the reign of Colonel Kurtz who has gone insane and is living up in Cambodia giving outregous orders. The movie it's not so much the destination as is the journey. During his travel, Willard meets a lot of characters including the ones that are with him in the boat, a Colonel Kilgore who assists him to crose to the other side of the river and more.<br /><br />I have to say that this film is outstanding in every regard. The locations are superb, the acting is amazing and the story is truly one of a kind. Dialogue is profound, funny, thoughtful and simply really good. Some scenes like the \\"Ryde of the Valkyries\\", \\"the meeting with Kurtz\\" and others are cinema classics that will be long remembered. Apocalypse Now is an exciting, often frightening ride that is require viewing for everyone. A classic materpiece through and through.<br /><br />Apocalypse Now was released by Lionsgate with new transfers supervised by Coppola himself and the release is a spectacular one.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />Apocalypse Now comes to Blu Ray for the first time in its original aspect ratio looking absolutely amazing. The definition, the clarity, the detail, the crispness are awesome. Skin tones are really well defined and not at all artificial. There are some scenes with ocassional flickering but it's not at all distracting. There are no signs of compression artifacts and most importantly, film grain hasn't been removed or tampered giving the film a nice real life appearance. An excellent transfer that rivals the ones produced for the Godfather films (and those are also excellent).<br /><br />Apocalypse Now is credited for creating the 5.1 surround sound and for this release Lionsgate offers a 5.1 DTS-HD MA that's abolutely mesmerizing. The sound is really well distributed and all sound effects are really crisp. Dialogue is also crystal clear and without any hint of damage or hiss. An outstanding audio presentation.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />Lionsgate released AN in two presentations: a two-disc special edition and a three disc \\"full disclosure edition\\" that it's the subject of review here<br /><br />Disc One:<br />On disc one you have two versions of the film: Apocalypse Now (1979 original) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001). Before I bought this set, I've only watched the Redux version which I liked but watching the original it seems to me that the 1979 version is the superior one. Some scenes in the Redux are too long (like the french plantation) but it's not a terrible version like many have point out. Regardless which version you prefer, the good thing is that you can choose (a thing George Lucas does not allow to us). Also both versions have an audio commentary by Coppola.<br /><br />Disc Two:<br />Here is where all the good stuff is included. New to this release is an interview with John Milius and Coppola and a conversation between Martin Sheen and Coppola. Both are required viewing because of the stories and the different perspectives they had about the film.Also you have an interview with Fred Roos who explains the casting process of the film and we are treated to some screen tests of the actor.<br /><br />Then you have the original reading of Hearts of Darkness by Orson Welles in 1938, an interview by Roger Ebert to Coppola in the 2001 Cannes Festival (which is also required viewing), Deleted scenes, a featurette that explains the birth of 5.1 sound, the music of Apocalypse, the color palette, the editing and much much more.<br /><br />Disc three:<br />This disc is exclusive to this release which includes the documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (in HD). Filmed by Eleanor Coppola during the production of the film, this documentary is one of the finest ever produced. You can watch the film and this documentary and you will not only know how the film was made but know first-hand all the troubles that Coppola faced and his slow descent into madness and obsession to finish the movie. This documentary should be seen by every film student and fans of the film everywhere.<br /><br />Also included in this disc are marketing material, storyboard galleries, photo archives and more.<br /><br />This package also includes a nice collector's booklet with annotations by Coppola.<br /><br />Closing thoughts:<br /><br />Apocalypse Now is a classic film that is a must-own and deserves a top spot in any film library. Lionsgate and Coppola have done a 5 star release that no one should miss. With an outstanding restoration, 2 versions of the film and hours upon hours of bonus material including the excellent documentary Hearts of Darness, this set is one of the best Blu-Ray releases ever and is highly recommended for everyone.and we are treated to some screen tests of the actor.

B0052UZIFA|4.0|This game is very fun. I liked the concept and the graphics. I didn't like how much memory was required when saving a game. The large size required I delete other info off my phone or stop playing, therefore, I stopped playing.   It's a quality game worth the download, but it has room for improvement.

B004XE0P5E|5.0|This album, like For Emma, feels like a gift that allows you to sort through your feelings and thoughts while you listen. It inches its way into long forgotten (or perhaps suppressed) moments and evokes pangs of hope, sadness, clarity, and nostalgia. I imagine the lyrics were kept vague on purpose, and so those looking for an exact story will be disappointed. Play the album when you have the time and space to indulge memories or feel the need to sort out your life. It will do wonders.

B002ZG9800|3.0|Jim Carrey was the singular reason I watched this film. The problem with this movie is that its not really a comedy, its not really a con-artist movie, its not really about gay relationships. It does all of these 3 things in somewhat equal measure and then loses out overall. I liked bits and pieces of it but too many times lost interest and was left with the feeling that if the director had focused on making a good con-artist movie, Jim Carrey could have turned it into something spectacular.
0375703764|5.0|\\"House of Leaves\\" is complicated.  To be brief, it is a criticism piece on a make-believe horror documentary The Navidson Record (akin to Paranormal Activity or the Blair Witch Project), debating the authenticity of the film and the themes surrounding it (twins Jacob and Esau, the minotaur of the labyrinth, etc).  The document is rife with citations, some real and some admittedly false.  As the criticism progresses, the book gets more and more challenging to read: pages are upside down, slanted, in boxes, etc.  The reader is asked to skip to the appendices, to hold the book up to a mirror, to decode secret messages.  The criticism regarding the themes is fascinating, although at times the scientific parts become dull, but the real content of the book lies in the descriptions of action in the documentary. That, and in the footnotes written by narrator Johnny Truant.<br /><br />Truant is a self-proclaimed unreliable narrator who accidentally comes across the above document when the writer of the document freakishly dies.  Truant becomes obsessed with piecing together the document for publication, and meanwhile becomes haunted with feelings of despair, fear, and a growling creature with menacing claws.  It is unknown to the narrator if Truant is truly experiencing these hauntings due to the actuality of a ghost/demon, or if Truant is suffering side-effects from his frequent drug use, alcoholism, or his family's history of mental instability.<br /><br />It took a long time for me to get through House of Leaves, not only due to its sheer volume, but due to the distraction of citations and footnotes.  I found parts to be boring (scientific explanations, for one), but was entranced by the idea of the house and the exploration of its hallways.  While House of Leaves is billed as a horror novel, it is never truly frightening, except in small bursts.  This is a book of suspense and would be unsatisfying for anyone looking for cheap thrills.  I have read that this book could be considered a criticism of criticism papers, which is an idea that intrigues me immensely.<br /><br />Do read if you enjoy a book a little atypical and have a lot of time on your hands.  Not recommended for those looking for a quick, instantly engaging read.riticism of criticism papers, which is an idea that intrigues me immensely.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I have never written a review for a book. However, this book is one of those few books that stays with you. Nothing I say hasn't been said, but if you are reading the reviews and have come across this book BUY IT! You will love it....it's a wonderful book!!1
B001BWQWKS|5.0|After listening to the Chilingirian Quartet's version as my top choice for the past few years (just edging out the Quarteto Italiano and Auryn and Melos Quartet versions), I heard this CD in Berlin and immediately ordered it. It is absolutely fantastic. I had no idea one could top the competition but this is quite extraordinary. These players are so totally inside the idiom of these great french quartets and they play with such technical finesse and delicacy mixed with passion that it is an amzing feat. Buy this before it disappears.
1573223085|5.0|Great book.  Very informative.  Pink gives good reasoning why people should seek out MFAs rather than MBAs.  Assigned to read it for a class, but I finished it well before the assigned date.  Couldn't put it down.
B003DZX3US|5.0|My daughter was simply overjoyed when we presented her this product. She loves all the characters including Beast and when she is not chatting about Beauty, she loves to imitate her moves. The songs too are simply moving, almost magical, a sure hit with any child interested in the Disney Princesses. I thought Angela Lansbury did the Mrs. Pott's voice so well...and of course sang a piece as well...
B0006L16N8|2.0|There are a few good songs.  Otherwise its melancholy background music to fall asleep to.  God, FIX YOU has to have the most irritating contrived manipulative lyrics in a song.  \\"Tears stream down your face, when you lose something you cannot replace.\\"  haha.  laughable.  \\"lights will guide you home, & ignite your bones.\\"  \\"i will fix you.\\"   c'mon, this is why coldplay is so popular, peddling this crap to the masses.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|I think this could be used for any surrounding, and its filed with so many harmonic plays, that its just fantastic to listen to. It relaxes me and enables me to dream, sleep and just focus on the here and now and possibly later. For those of you who compare this to new age, you are deaf. This is a treat to listen to and hear the sound play
B004WPYNY8|3.0|I really hate when bands copy themselves, One of the best in the world did just that, Symphony X rerecorded their previous album and change the name. Iconoclast would be an excellent album for almost any other band, but for Symphony X is a drawback. In paradise Lost the heavy , angry, fast sound was exactly what was needed, the whole theme of hell, fallen angels and stuff like that fitted that sound like a glove. In The Odyssey you could listen to some of that angry sound and Russell's vocal roar along with style, but not here, this is a step in the wrong direction. Is simply a very unsymphonic Symphony X release. After albums like Volume 5 and Twilight at Olympus the bar was set very high, and I expect more from this guys. I hope that in 2 or 3 years they will release some more accordingly with that style that made them one of the best metal bands ever.
B0050CQY1W|2.0|I don't like the musical direction Beyonce is going through.  I really only like her first album because it was real r and b music.  Now she is doing this rock anthem stuff and all her songs sound overly dramatic, like she's trying so hard to be different. She actually sounds like a crazy person when she sings now.  There's only a couple decent songs on here, most of the songs are skip-overs.  And the deluxe edition is a pain because you have to switch cds just to hear the 3 bonus songs.  Why couldn't they just put them on the same disc?  There's really no reason to mention the best songs.  \\"Party\\" was ok, but honestly the cd gets progressivley worse as you go along, like a downward spiral.  I wish Beyonce would do a real r and b album like her first one. Like that will ever happen.
B0041TM5OU|5.0|I agree with many of the other reviewers that this record sounds incredible. I am not a huge jazz fan and this is really the only classic jazz album I've owned, but I cannot get enough of it. I am relatively new to the vinyl world and this 180g edition is destined to be my \\"showoff\\" album when I demonstrate my new turntable to people. I highly recommend this edition to anyone who enjoys the full experience of listening to a vinyl album.
055380684X|5.0|Now, if this book isn't a display of remarkable talent, I don't know what is!<br /><br />Not only does Daniel Coyle de-code talent, but he uses his own to brilliantly weave the story behind greatness. Clearly, he's honed his writing talent. (And, after reading this book, you'll understand the neurological processes enabling that growth!)<br /><br />The book tells the story of the three components of the talent-code: deep practice, ignition, and master coaching. The protagonist of the talent story is myelin--our brain's insulation that responds to neural firing and wraps skill circuits. It is these tightly wrapped circuits that are the building blocks of talent. The plot of the talent story thickens (literally, from a myelin-perspective) as master coaches combine the forces of deep practice and ignition to grow talent in others.<br /><br />I'm pretty much blown away by this book. (Reading the previous reviews I see I'm not alone in this department!) Ever since I have read it, I've seen endless possibilities on how this unlocked code has the power to unlock human potential in all areas from education, to sports, to therapy, to parenting, and everything in between. _The Talent Code_ is certainly one of those books that has the power to help you maximize your potential--and that of those around you.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|It's just a shame that this movie had to be made..... to 'sum up' the series, \\"Firefly\\". This movie gives more detail and answers some questions that are floating around in the series.  It is so paralell to current political status that the 'powers that be' couldn't stand to let it continue on the air.  The movie is well done and the characters continue their banter, sexual tensions, and rogue behaviors, drawing a strong conclusion in the end, as to what happens to a world when the Government tries to control everything and create a 'perfect world'.  The casting was genius and the mix of old and future made you feel like it was really possible for our own future to be similar.  Great plot, and each time I watch it, I find a little something new.... in the set, the dialogue, the characters..... everything.  Super great movie.
B0026P40NU|5.0|If you are a huge fan of the PRB, you'll find a number of flaws in Desperate Romantics -- enough that I had to summon Coleridge's \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" in order to enjoy it -- which I actually did.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />* The series never addresses Lizzie's pregnancies -- two of them -- that also helped push her to the edge of sanity. Lizzie was pregnant twice in actuality. The fetus died iwhen she was pregnant with the first child, and she was forced -- as often happened in that day -- to carry it to term, go into labor and give birth to a corpse. This took a terrible emotional toll on Lizzie. She was already suffering with Gabriel's incessant affairs, and she felt worthless. When she became pregnant again, and the affairs accelerated, she increased her laudanum intake and died of an overdose. While many believe she committed suicide and it was covered up in order that she would be buried in hallowed ground, I'm of the school that does not discount murder by one of Rossetti's crazed mistresses. Most likely candidate from where I sit would be Fannie Cornforth, who posed for Boca Baciata and who was mad about Gabriel. There are any number of candidates.<br /><br />* The infamous disinterrment. The film shows Gabriel tossing his poetry in ON TOP of the closed coffin. This is inaccurate. Not only did he bury the poems in the coffin, but the legend grew up that when they disinterred her, her famed red hair had grown to the point that it filled the coffin. The poems were riddled by worms. Fitting, if nothing else.<br /><br />* The number of paintings for which she posed.  The film downplayed the scores of paintings for which Lizzie posed -- she was Gabriel's primary model. Read Christina Rossetti's poem about Lizzie and her brother -- it was her face that \\"looked out\\" from every canvas he painted -- even when he painted other models. And while the posthumous painting of Lizzie is his most famous painting of her and is considered his masterpiece by many -- it's far from his only or best painting of Lizzie.<br /><br />* No mention of Christina. Even though it shows Gabriel's painting of the Annunciation which featured Christina, his sister, it failed to mention her at all even in context of the painting.<br /><br />* The deplorable depiction of William Morris.  They somehow found it appropriate to turn the founder of the Arts and Crafts movement into little more than a buffoon.<br /><br />* Minimizing Gabriel's role in the movement.  Rossetti was the primary artist in the movement and the founder of the PRB. He was a most prolific painter, yet Millais and Hunt are shown painting more portraits. I think whoever scripted this series had a bias against  Rossetti. Heaven knows, I have my own bias in that area -- due to his philandering and mistreatment of Lizzie -- but you can't deny the man's genius or belittle him. Look at Proserpine, The Beloved, La Ghirlandata, Astarte Syriaca.<br /><br />REDEEMING QUALITIES:<br /><br />The film DID do a fantastic job of its portrayal of Ruskin, of Hunt, who was given over to both his rakish ways AND his extreme religion, of Ruskin's poor virgin wife. And its portrayal of Millais is sheer genius, I felt. He was depicted precisely as I've envisioned.<br /><br />Another greatly redeeming quality is its portrayal of the PRB as they were - wild young men barely out of their teens with these preposterous dreams of being the next great movement in art -- something they dreamed and then made come to pass with all the dynamic energy and bravado of their youth. They erupted through a staid and boring period of art to create a veritable volcano of human emotion and humanism -- whether you're looking at Boca Baciata or Ophelia or Millais' Blind Girl or even Hunt's Scapegoat.<br /><br />I loved seeing them with their hats on lopsided, swaggering through the cobblestone streets, demanding to be seen.<br /><br />So that was wonderful enough that I know I'll watch the series again. All that said, I still wait impatiently for the day when a film about the incredible story of the PRB will be made with a measure of accuracy. The truth was far more dramatic than the watered down version this became.l be made with a measure of accuracy. The truth was far more dramatic than the watered down version this became.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|The thing I love most about Foo Fighters is that they can Rock hard, but also have lyrics that are deep and meaningful. A lot of bands come out that have rockin' songs, but the lyrics are just basically crap when you sit down and listen. The main focus is usually how awesome the music is, and the lyrical meaning is ignored. With Foo Fighters, the lyrics are deep and meaningful. That's what I have noticed with this album especially. Yeah, the songs are catchy, but there is a whole other level and depth to the record if you are listening to what's being said.<br /><br />I don't know if I would say that this is my favorite Foo Fighters album, but it is right up on the same level as my favorites. It's definitely proof that this band is here to stay. Believe the reviews here and go right now and pick up Wasting Light. This has set the bar for other Rock artists this year (maybe even the next few years) and I doubt there will be another album coming out that will be able to touch this. Great, great stuff! I can't wait to hear what the Foo comes out with next
B0041B4H1M|4.0|This movie not that old, but where else can you get to see Samuel L Jackson eaten by a shark?  That given away, (I figured most know this fact) I say this movie action starts very early when some sharks attack a boat with kids. Then moves on to the story line and never stops. I think each actor brings a special mix of their character that's a step above most 2D characters In horror films today.   But alas one of the real tests was the Blu Ray copy and I didn't think It anything exceptional at all for a Blu Ray transfer. My regular DVD looks every so slightly as good as the Blu Ray when upconverted In the Blu Ray player. I had wonder If the Blu Ray was worth It. So my advice If you love the movie get In Blu Ray, If you just want own to watch the DVD should be fine even on widescreen. Hence 4 stars.
0425241505|4.0|Pia Giovanni is in trouble and she knows it.  Under duress, she's just stolen from the most powerful dragon on the planet, and he's going to come searching from her.  She knows her life is pretty much over, it's just a matter of when and how.<br /><br />Dragos Cuelebre is outraged - he cannot believe someone found his treasure, let alone was able to steal from it!  He's got a few clues, and he plans to find this thief - not only because he wants to know how she did it, but because he can't get her scent out of his thoughts.<br /><br />My Quick Thoughts:<br />OMG - this was such a fun, sexy read!!  Dragos is such a fabulous Alpha male - very \\"You're mine, I must protect you\\", and Pia is an independent woman - very \\"Don't tell me what to do, I can take care of myself\\".  Together they make sparks fly.<br /><br />Dragon Bound is about more than sexy dragon time though - we learn that the people behind Pia's initial foray into Dragos' treasure lair are quite unsavory and will do anything to cripple Dragos and his empire, and aren't afraid to use Pia and her special talents to achieve their goals. Pia also has a secret that she's been hiding her whole life, and when she finally shares her secret with Drago - Oh, it was a pretty sweet secret :)<br /><br />In addition to a fabulous hero and heroine, Ms. Harrison's secondary characters were interesting and I want to read more about them.  I'm super-excited about the next book - Storm's Heart - which will center around Dragos' vivacious head of PR, Tricks, and one of his bodyguards, Tiago.

B004RSCWZ2|3.0|Unfortunately, this was a big step back.  I like Susan Tedeschi, but the more I've listed to Derek Trucks, the more I've become convinced that he is BETTER than Duane.  Even BETTER than Hendrix.  Then you look at the list of musicians on the album.  Take the best of the DTB band, add guys like Oteil Burbidge, and you just expect so much.  So I found this album highly disappointing.  He still has the technical capabilities of the best Jazz musicians, but this one really lacks the soul of the Blues musicians that he has always exhibited.  It is interesting, but very even keel, and almost lacking in any emotional dynamics.  It just doesn't reach out, grab you, and take you with it the way his DTB stuff does.  It is worth having, but it won't get played like the rest of the DTB stuff, or even ST's Back to the River, does.
B00008GKEG|5.0|There have been many books and documentaries made about the Beatles by other people. This is the only large-scale review of their career by the Beatles themselves. That doesn't mean everything in it is accurate; in fact, early on it is apparent when McCartney says he is 18 months older than George and George says the difference is 9 months (George is right) that memory can play tricks. However, details aside, the magic of this production is that the three remaining Beatles talk about their own impressions of the life and times of the group. John is only represented by clips, but his contribution is invaluable in completing the picture.    Apart from their story told in their own voices, there are numerous performances included, both live and lip-synched, which give a good understanding of how the band developed over the years. Naturally, there is far more of this material from the years 1962-1966, when they were touring, than from 1967-970. That leads to my only serious complaint about the set; surely, given the paucity of later material, the 1969 'rooftop concert' should have been shown in full? Especially since it seems unlikely that the movie 'Let It Be' will be rereleased any time soon.    That apart, anyone who is interested in the Beatles should regard this set as the best available record of their career as well as the most insightful portrait of the band members. It's a must-have.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Awesome season. Not the strongest in my opinion but still great. With a good lead in from season 4 it stayed pretty strong throughout. Can't wait for season 6 to see how Dex settles down after the huge character shifts that have happened from season 4 to present.

B000IB681Q|5.0|I was a kid when this first came out, but remember how wildly popular it was at the time. Over the years I've seen this dozens of times and never get bored watching it. The story could be set at any time, but I think it captures the period perfectly; a time of both innocence and rebellion. The main theme is unforgettable, as is the catch phrase from the movie - love is never having to say your sorry. Although Ali Magraw's performance is a little wooden, Ray Milland pulls off his supporting role seemlessly. If you like a good Love Story, then you might enjoy this one.

0545123275|5.0|Right now we're being inundated in paranormal romances -- including quite a few about werewolves. But Maggie Stiefvater's \\"Shiver\\" has a delicate, wintry quality that most paranormal romances lack, as well as a romance that tosses aside \\"Twilight\\"-style crushy obsessions in favor of a gentle, sweet romance threatened by nature itself.<br /><br />Several years ago, Grace was attacked by a pack of wolves in the woods -- and unexpectedly rescued by a yellow-eyed wolf. Ever since, he's appeared in the woods in the winter, and vanishes in summer. What she doesn't know is that the yellow-eyed wolf is a werewolf, who also lives as a boy named Sam.<br /><br />Then a teenage boy is killed by wolves, and his body is stolen from the morgue. The town of Mercy Falls is thrown into a frenzy, but Grace knows that something supernatural is afoot.<br /><br />When a bunch of illegal hunters try to kill the wolf pack, Grace rushes in to save her wolf -- and finds \\"her wolf\\" as a wounded, naked human boy. It turns out that cold triggers his transformations, while \\"warm makes me me. Makes me Sam.\\" But as the cold approaches the town again, Grace may lose Sam in more than one way -- if she isn't destroyed as well.<br /><br />\\"Shiver\\" has a poetic quality that most urban fantasy lacks -- it's a delicate, hauntingly crystalline book where even the humdrum high-school stuff takes on an ethereal quality. Maggie Stiefvater really came up with a unique idea for werewolves as well, where their transformation is dependent on the temperature -- cold makes them wolves, warmth makes then human. (Why don't they move to the tropics then?)<br /><br />And her prose has a shimmering beauty that envelops you in black-leafed forests, wintry skies, snow-encrusted fur and icy air (\\"Despite the chilly air that made ghosts of my breath...\\"). She writes dramatic, intense situations that really grasp your emotions (Grace stumbling across a transformed Jack), but without melodrama or excessive dialogue.<br /><br />I'm also rather sick of hormonal teenagers obsessing on each other and calling it \\"true love.\\" Grace and Sam's relationship is a much more moving one -- hesitant, unsure, but deeply caring and rooted in true affection. Stiefvater explores their personalities in detail before they ever \\"meet\\" each other, and she constructs a delicate web of other relationships -- Shelby, Beck, Isabel, Jack, and so on.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater's \\"Shiver\\" is a werewolf novel that deftly sidesteps many of the genre cliches, and leaves you in a chilly cocoon of beautiful prose. A must-read for those who want something more substantial and less creepy than \\"Twilight.\\"ers obsessing on each other and calling it \\"true love.\\" Grace and Sam's relationship is a much more moving one -- hesitant, unsure, but deeply caring and rooted in true affection.

1594744769|5.0|Sixteen year old Jacob grew up listening to his grandfather's stories about peculiar children he once knew at an orphanage.  He even had photographs to supplement these stories: photographs of a levitating girl, a boy holding up a boulder, and an invisible boy among others.  As Jacob grew older he realized these stories were simply half-truths.  His grandfather, Abe, was simply embellishing his childhood in order to hide from the horrors of war... right? After Abe dies under bizarre circumstances, Jacob is whisked away to the island to see this orphanage and find out the truth.  He finds out is that his grandfather's stories were actually more truth than stories, and Jacob finds himself in a situation where he must protect these children who haven't aged a day from the same danger that killed his grandfather.<br /><br />I first heard about this book from Amazon's \\"Best of the Month\\" feature and was immediately intrigued.  Images of real photographs are dispersed throughout the novel which I thought sounded really unique.  I picked this book up for the library and once I started reading, I never wanted to put it down.  This book grabbed my attention right away and held it until the end of the last page.<br /><br />When I first started the book, I was amazed by the uniqueness.  The format of the book itself is interesting, and the story is filled with bizarre characters.  Jacob finds these peculiar children, but they aren't even the most bizarre thing in this book.  There's also women who turn into birds, time travel to a day that repeats itself over and over, and monsters with tentacle like things that come out of their mouths that only Jacob can see.  I pride myself on figuring out the endings of books before I get to them, but this book had so many twists and turns that I never knew where we were going next.<br /><br />This book started off so unique and different, and I was completely in love with it, but as it went on, the book became less unique, and more standard action/adventure-y.  I found myself thinking of Percy Jackson or Harry Potter.  It became a group of not completely normal kids on an adventure to stop something evil.  Don't get me wrong, I still was obsessed with this book because by then I was in love with the characters and the story.<br /><br />However, this book's end is not an end.  It ends at the start of an even bigger journey which I'm assuming will be told in a sequel.  I'm torn about this.  I love these characters so I will be happy to revisit them.  However, I think by trying to make this book drawn out to be a series, it lost the uniqueness that it started with.  I think that if this book had been wrapped up at the end and had just been a stand alone novel, it would be one of the most unique books (sorry I keep using the word unique, but it's the word that best fits this book) I've ever read.  As a series, it becomes more of a standard adventure tale of good kids battling evil monsters.  I can't really say that I see this as a bad thing though, because like I've stated, I love this story and I would love to follow this characters in another adventure.<br /><br />Overall, I really adored this book and I'd highly recommend it.  I think anyone who enjoys an adventure with quirky characters will love this book.  Just be prepared to commit yourself to reading a sequel.I found myself thinking of Percy Jackson or Harry Potter.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|This could deserve the best album of year, a major competitor of Born this way. Adele's voice sounds just so fine! Every single piece within the album is worth listening. I just kinda wish her next album is not gonna use her age as name of the album lol.
0375850864|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a co-worker about a week before it was awarded the Newbery. She knew of my love for L'Engle's Time Quartet and thought that I would identify with the protagonist.<br /><br />And how!<br /><br />I was blown away. This book is full of engaging characters and breadcrumbs are left on every page, including the cover. By the time the end is resolved and all secrets have been spoken you will ask yourself how on Earth you didn't figure it out sooner. And if you were one of the clever ones who guessed correctly the ending, you will appreciate the majesty of everything lining up just so.<br /><br />Read A Wrinkle in Time, then read this book, but above all else, Tesser Well.
B00009W0U4|1.0|Ugly, mean-spirited, misogynistic, homophobic, simple-minded movie that assails the audience with violence and adolescent hate fantasies and cheap gimmicks, while posing as art. The movie revolves around two things: a sadistic rape that is basically torture porn, and a gay-bashing revenge fantasy that is a release for those who hate gays and want to see them smashed into a bloody pulp. Other than that, there is no content. The first twenty or thirty minutes has the camera whirling around constantly, so that it will produce severe motion sickness in most. Whereas writers used to use great acting, writing, set design, staging and so forth to create changes in the audience such as catharsis, now I suppose a physiological change, from physically well to physically ill, passes for a state change or catharsis. (Motion sickness rather than emotion sickness). This is why it's basically a porn film. It's designed to work only on physiological responses, to produce a \\"violence erection.\\" The telling of the story in reverse produces the same effect, that is, to so utterly disorient the audience that it can't follow the story and is forced to rely only on its physiological responses. As such it's the very lowest form of entertainment.

B0042GNDT8|5.0|This is essentially the same program as RCA previously offered in their Living Stereo series for much more money - [[ASIN:B000003G5X Reiner Conducts Strauss]].  What is different is on the disk with the Burleske and Rosenkavalier Waltzes, a Mono version of Tod und Verklaerung from 1950 has been substituted for the 1962 Also Sprach Zarathustra.  The packaging also indicates \\"this compliation P 2010.\\"  I am not sure if that means a 2010 remastering or not.  These forty-something ears have lost some of their high register and I am unable to tell the difference between this and the Living Stereo release of the 1954 Also Sprach. Other five star reviewers have said it best on the individual releases in the Living Stereo series and the performances obviously haven't changed, so I won't repeat their accolades here.      I will add more about the 1950 Tod once I make it that far in my listening.  I am so excited about this I couldn't wait to post a review!  Buy this before RCA changes their mind and withdraws it or ups the price!
B001NFNFNU|4.0|If you have ever had any doubts as to Angelina's acting chops, and I will admit to falling into that category, then this movie should change your mind. It certainly changed mine.    Based on a true story, and all the more disturbing because of that, Jolie plays a single mother during the Depression whose only child goes missing. What follows is a harrowing tale with enough twists and turns to keep your interest all the way to the final credits, albeit without any of the usual explosions, gunfire, and other special effects that you would expect from a Jolie movie. There are a couple of characters that you will thoroughly enjoy loathing, and if by the end of the movie you don't find your heart going out in support of the star's character you should check yourself in for a transplant.
0307272702|4.0|First of, I have this book as an Audiobook that I bought from Audible.com. And Since Audible.com is a subcompany of Amazon, I saw fit to review this where I can write for the greater number of audience. (This is my excuse for not having that certified review icon).<br /><br />Now, this book is really eye opening. I have always been intrigued by nutrition and read books like: Paleo Diet, Primal Blueprint, China Study, etc. But I feel that these books are really biased towards their respected philosophy. But Why We Get Fat by Taubes is based on research that he found, it's a reader-friendly version of Good Calories, Bad Calories, which is way too thick on research. But the premise of this book is: Getting fat and losing weight is not just about calories in and calories out.<br /><br />Long theory short, the main blame on gradual weight gain is: carbohydrates and the raised insulin levels. Taubes logic behind this is that, in modern society, we see obesity in the lower social classes. But since people with less money, tend to buy less foods, why are they getting fat? The main culprit is processed carbs and sugar, which leads to raised insulin levels, which leads to getting fat. No surprises there. So yes, this is what the whole book is about.<br /><br />Gary Taubes, however, really downgrades the theory of calories in and calories out, and states that exercise makes us hungry so we eat more, therefore we don't lose weight. But by reading all these books, and studying nutrition I've found that health is not at all complicated.<br /><br />1) Don't overeat. This may sound redundant, and simple; and god forbid we humans don't like simplicity. But the surest way of avoiding obesity is not overeating. I mean, through all the books I've read on nutrition, this is the main point that I derived.<br /><br />2) Try not to spike blood sugar. Eating sweets is okay once in a while, but studies show that fat cells get bigger when insulin level is raised, and not so much when insulin level is low or steady.<br /><br />3) More veggies and fruits. Great ways to get the dense micronutrients from veggies and fruits is by juicing. Go to your local farmers market; I've found that it is so much cheaper (this is an understatement) to buy at the farmers market than in your local groceries, and most of them are organic too. Once you buy veggies and fruits, juice them to get the nutrients you need without eating a large bowl a day; which is almost impossible. And if you don't like juicing, then make a fruit and veggie salad.<br /><br />4) Fats are not the enemy. Now this goes against the low fat mantra, but let me explain. Fat is necessary for human health. Most important is the right omega 3/ omega 6 ratio around 2:1; we get too much omega 6 and not enough omega 3. Fats, even saturated fats, are necessary for human health, yes that includes saturated fats. Fat in moderation, can be healthy, and like everything else, fat in excess is not.<br /><br />5) Exercise. You don't have to be a world class athlete or look a certain way to be fit. Do something you enjoy to elevate heart rate levels. Such as playing with your dog, going to the park with your kids, basketball, gardening, anything so that your heart rate goes above 100. Little goes a long way, 30 minutes to an hour a day. Make it fun, so you are likely to do it everyday and enjoy it.<br /><br />Really you can read all the books, buy all the pills, take part in the latest fads, but health is really common sense; it is simple; and doable. I've taken nutrition classes, read books, studied it, change my diets here and there, but really it is  all about just DOING what you already know. It is the DOING part that gets us, not the knowing part.ggies and fruits. Great ways to get the dense micronutrients from veggies and fruits is by juicing.

0894803123|5.0|I got a Cuisinart Ice Cream and Frozen Yogurt maker, and had a hard time finding recipes to make my own ice cream, with whole and fresh ingredients sans all of that other chemical junk in store bought ice cream.     This book is outstanding, once you learn to make the base of your ice cream your possibilites are endless, and you can use your imagination to create new and exciting flavors using minimal ingredients that you can pronounce.    My kids love when I say we're making ice cream and can't wait to taste it. I leave the eggs out of my ice cream and I find the ice cream is still very tasty and scoopable, though as other reviewers mentioned this book was published way before we were worried about salmonella, so if you like to add eggs, just purchase the pre-pasturized eggs and you'll be fine.    For $10 this book is really a bargain, I have found books that were triple the price with less than stellar recipes.    Buy this, you won't regret it!

There is no music on earth like Robert Johnson, and it can't be explained. It's like listening to music from another planet, not just another time. He had command of something that can't be defined or described. You just need to own it. I highly suggest you see that you do.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|It has been quite some time since a truly scary movie has come along.  This has all the cheap thrills and genuine chills of great horror.  It pays obvious homage to the greats before it but has enough originality to stand on its own.    This is the kind of movie you get for the girlfriend\wife when she wants to watch something scary.  This is the kinda movie you get for the young teens for a sleep over and its perfect for any rainy night.  It goes easy on the strong language for the most part and there is really no blood and gore.  Just plenty of good scares.
B0057UVLQ0|1.0|We've been a big fan of Selena Gomez since the early days of Wizards of Waverly Place. We've consistently been impressed with her voice and her attempt to be a great role model for young girls - until now.     It seems that someone from Selena's recording studio thought it would be great to \\"grow her up\\" by snatching up a track from Brittany Spears titled \\"Whiplash\\". The song is a techno style song that sticks in your head readily enough, but midway through she says the line, \\"It makes me weak, so D* weak\\"... (Bing/Google the lyrics).    Then we have a song about spending the night with a boyfriend. Yeah, this isn't the Selena on Wizards anymore.      Granted she's getting older now at age 19 but most of her fans are early and pre-teens. For many parents giving an album to their children with swearing on it is beyond unacceptable. Who wants to hear their 10 year old swearing in the shower? Or on a car ride? Or skipping rope? And when did getting older mean automatic swearing and a lack of self respect? There's simply no reason for well respected girls to take the gutter road just because they turned \\"hollywood 19\\".       Anyway, suffice it to say that we were very disappointed. This marks the last album we'll get. It's a shame too because my kids (and many others) really looked up to her as one of the few great kid show stars that didn't drink the \\"leave the kids behind\\" kool-aid like Miley (drugs, nudity, swearing), Vanessa Hudgens (nudity, swearing), and so many others before her.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|Before getting around to watching this film, I'd heard a lot of mixed things from various friends and online critics. They were saying that the film dragged in places, was filled with pointless parts that amount to nothing, and that if someone hadn't read the books, they'd be completely confused as to what was happening. Most the hardcore Harry Potter fans said it was a great representation of the book. . . so while first sliding the Blu-Ray disc into my Playstation 3, there was a sense of apprehension. 'The Deathly Hallows' as a book, while good, has its problems. What if the film turned out to compound those problems instead of solve them? Many film adaptations have a tendancy toward that.     Another thing that bothered me before I'd even watched it, was why did they have to split this into two films? They produced a great film adaptation of 'The Order of the Phoenix', and that book is packed with way more content than DH. The popular answer was that WB could milk the cash cow. But come on. . . all the Harry Potter films could have benefited from being split into two parts. At least DH will be covering more area than the others were allowed.     Now that I have watched the film, I cannot say that I was \\"pleasantly surprised\\". . . associating the word \\"pleasant\\" with DH seems wrong, given how unforgivingly dark this story is. Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is a puppy in comparison (a puppy that bites your ankles, but a puppy nonetheless). But I will say that everything taken into account, DH is a damn decent experience.    The first scene gives us a revealing look at Voldemort and the Death Eaters, as they all sit around a table to discuss their progress of universal domination. Most interesting is that Severus Snape takes part in this meeting; even after killing Dumbledore in the last installment, you as the viewer will still suspect that there was more to that situation than meets the eye. Snape is a complex person. It's too bad that Alan Rickman had nextto nothing to do in Part I, but it's always a good diversion to look at the character and wonder what's going on inside his head (Rickman typically plays Snape very stoic and collected, unless the scene calls for something else). Luckily, you'll be treated to a lot of the character's backstory in Part II; that is, if they keep true to the novel, which in this case they -really- need to do.    The gears begin to turn fast as we see Hermione wipe her parents' memories of their daughter, along with any indication inside of their home that she ever existed (photos of her fade into non-existence). Elsewhere, Harry stands outside 4 Privet Drive and watches the Dursleys as they hastily leave with only a few seconds of screen time (you don't hear me complaining). The film moves very fast from here until the camping scenes. If you want some time to take a breather, you'll have to wait a while.    We follow our trio on a quest that's destination seems impossible to reach, both to them and we the viewers. Harry, Ron, and Hermione need to find the horcruxes in order to stop Voldemort from ever reincarnating, but at the same time they have to evade the countless Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers that have infiltrated both the basic wizarding world and the Ministry of Magic itself. They all have strong doubts that their mission can ever be successful. You'll feel that doubt along with them, because this film is filled with introspective moments and rising tensions: Harry is determined, but at the same time jaded and lost. You can hear it in Daniel Radcliffe's voice, see it in his eyes. Hermione is devoted to helping the cause, always providing clear evidence of her own competence and the incompetence of the two young men. She has to be at the top of her game in this new wizarding world of intolerance, being a muggle-born. Ron's storyline is reminiscent of 'The Goblet of Fire' in that he wrestles with feelings of inadequacy when placed next to Harry, and in DH he goes overthe edge (though partly due to the evil influence of the locket horcrux, a nice nod to the One Ring from 'The Lord of the Rings').     My favorite parts, and what I believe are also objectively the best parts, all pertain to camping. The trio are isolated in their trips across the wilds of Britain; it's being out in the middle of nowhere that we learn most about them as characters, and realize how much they've matured over the course of the series. In the past Harry has depended on the Dursleys, Dumbledore, the Weasleys, but now he's on his own, calling the shots and cutting out a shaky existence for himself and his friends. Harry Potter is a man now.     This film is darker than I imagined the story being while reading the book. While many of the events that transpire in both book and film are essentially the same, the film's execution makes the story all the more hopeless, cynical, and gritty. One scene that stands out is when Harry and Ron come up the stairs from the Malfoy's basement to find Hermione lying on the cold, hard floor with \\"mudblood\\" carved into her flesh, presumably from Bellatrix's dagger. For me, this was more moving than any death that happened in the films thus far; maybe it's because Avada Kedavra is a painless release from life, whereas the torture and degradation of Hermione leaves the viewer with the impression that Hermione will have to relive those moments in her mind for the remainder of her life.    In the following scene, when the trio escape the clutches of the Death Eaters, we are met with the sudden death of Dobby the house-elf. I see this as being the ultimate end to Harry's childhood (moreso than the death of Hedwig earlier in the film). With Dobby gone, there is nothing innocent and endearing left in Harry's life to anchor him to his earlier years at Hogwarts. Dobby was always an annoying character, but a lovable character. You couldn't help but feel warmth at his efforts to save Harry Potter time and time again, even when those attempts endangered Harry's physical well-being. When Harry buries Dobby, he's also burying the last remnants of that special magic from the first few films. There is nothing sweet left in the universe until Harry can manage to defeat Lord Voldemort, once and for all. As someone who has read the book, I warn you that there are many more deaths to come in Part II. Major characters start dropping like flies.    While darkness isn't a positive attribute in and of itself, it's a framework wherein a lot of meaningful things can happen. Usually through loss or death. And a lot of that happens in the Harry Potter series. The screenplay writer, Steve Kloves, delivers much of the potential that comes alongside mature storytelling; as J.K. Rowling did to some degree in the novel itself.     If I had to think of something to complain about, it'd be that the film moves too fast in places. It's already two and a half hours. I believe it would've been a good idea to stretch that out a little further to give these scenes more time to play out, so that the finished product didn't seem like such a flash before your eyes.

B0052VUNHC|2.0|There seem to be comparitively few young adult romances set in college, rather than in high school, so I was intrigued by this one. And I love a good bad boy! But the story didn't quite meet my expectations. I appreciated how the author developed Abby and Travis's relationship slowly from dislike and disapproval to friendship and respect to love.  It was the love that didn't quite win me over. Talk about dysfunctional! Abby's roommate calls their relationship creepy and codependent and I have to agree.<br /><br />One other complaint- the A story is obviously the love story between Abby and Travis. For the first 2/3 of the book there is no B story. Then all of a sudden! there's a B story about Abby's father and Abby's poker abilities that takes the focus completely off the love story. I'm fine with a B story, but you can't pop it in 2/3 of the way through the book- there should have been a lot more foreshadowing of that development all through the book.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|The book is amazing - I will be purchasing this book in hardback soon. With that said the Kindle book is lacking. As I read through the book there are several typos. I don't know if they were missed in translation or if the Kindle reader on my phone has a glitch but when I checked it on my wife's phone it had the same issue. Seems through out the book every time a unit of measure is used (such as the lb sterling symbol) the translator screwed up and just stuck in a bunch of symbols. I really do hope that someone spends some time on this and can fix it. I know that this is enough reason for me to stick with my page turning. Thank you for the great download and good luck with the fix.
B004WJV6OY|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Pearl Jam's early CDs...hit and miss on the last 3-4 for me.   That said, Eddie Vedder is a very engaging, talented musician with a huge heart and a bigger conscious.  The editing/recording of this show was done very, very well.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I bought this season because I had seen a few episodes on television and the show seemed pretty interesting. I wanted to get into it, but I wanted to start from the beginning since the serial killer Red John is recurring and integral to the story as a whole. I absolutely did not regret this purchase, and would in fact recommend this show highly to anyone. The best comparison I can make is if Bones merged with House, although Patrick Jane is a much more likeable character than House in my opinion.    As before mentioned, the show essentially revolves around Jane, an ex-psychic/con artist, and the serial killer, Red John, who killed Jane's wife and daughter. In the first season, they give you just the right balance of revealing interactions between Jane and John while leaving out just enough to keep you wanting more! The script is well written and witty, and all of the characters are very distinct and likeable. It is also very refreshing to see a show where the main male and female protagonists aren't really \\"love interests\\". It's pretty obvious that Jane and the main CBI agent, Lisbon, have some chemistry, but it is by no means a main point in the story. It's just sort of there for intrigue and could even be chocked up to just Platonic love for each other. Still, there is that drama between another pair of agents, Rigsby and van Pelt, which is very satisfying and will entertain those who desire the drama in their show.    Overall, I'd say this show would satisfy just about any audience! It has drama, crime, comedy, love, serial killers, witty dialogue, intriguing characters, and overall well-written script. For how cheap it is on Amazon, I would say that you simply cannot lose by getting this season on DVD!

B0057UVLQ0|4.0|Selena Gomez has built quite the profile, it seems. With a genre-hopping debut album and a sleek, modern sophomore record to her name, she is taking her band The Scene and their taking over the dancefloor. It's always difficult to bridge the gap between child star and authentic adult celebrity, but Selena manages to complete the process that began with her sophomore album. 'When The Sun Goes Down' arrives ten months after 'A Year Without Rain', a situation that would lead some to believe this album will be no good, considering the little studio time it had compared to, say, the five or so years Robyn spent developing her self-titled dancefloor soundtrack, the pop album with which all others are measured against. These cynics would, in fact, be wrong.    'When The Sun Goes Down' is, above all, an intelligent pop record. It all kicks off with 'Love You Like a Love Song', a dub-step laced song with hooks built for the long term. While the first several songs are reminiscent of the past two records, something incredible happens on Track Four: Pixie Lott. A full-blown star in the UK, she is a complete unknown here in the US. Of all the pop stars to feature on a song, why her? Credibility. It's something Selena deserves after serving up three fantastic pop records in as many years, but also something that she hasn't yet obtained. This may finally be what gets it for her.    After the brilliant duo of 'We Own the Night' and the cathedral-filling chorus of 'Hit the Lights', the album abandons all teen-pop pretenses and becomes equal parts rave-up and confessional. The beats run heavy, both fun and serious, while the subject matter feels more natural than it ever has before. While there are slight cracks in the club-ready veneer, such as the slightly lukewarm 'Bang Bang Bang' and the acoustic driven lead single, there are more than enough moments to make up for it. 'Whiplash' rips along a wild rhythm accompanied by spoken British, 'That's More Like It' pops like bubblegum, and 'Middle of Nowhere' sends through a vocal blender. It's these types of factors that separate the smart pop stars from the more faceless ones, and with this record Selena takes up arms with Robyn and Little Boots rather than Jennifer Lopez and Cascada.    The lead single, 'Who Says', set quite the deceiving framework for this album. It was a necessary addition to this record, though, as the last lingering piece of Selena's Disney Channel past. In all likelihood, it will be shed with her next album, one that will send Selena's already bright star into the stratosphere where it belongs.    Recommended Tracks: 'Love You Like a Love Song', 'We Own the Night', 'Hit The Lights'
0439023521|4.0|This review contains very minor spoilers<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a good book. For the most part, it's fast-paced and the characters are likable enough. The plot is also very interesting. The book really held my attention until the very end. But I will get to that.<br /><br />First of all, the premise of the book is pretty dark. The US is now Panem, divided into 12 districts plus the ruling Capitol, and every year a raffle called the reaping takes place in all 12 districts, where two children aged 12-18 are selected to compete in The Hunger Games, a 24-person battle to the death, where only one can walk out alive. And the entire thing is televised and required viewing in all districts, as a reminder to the population that the Capitol has complete control over their lives.<br /><br />The story is told from the perspective of Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year-old girl whose sister's name is drawn from the reaping ball, and through a rule in the games, is allowed to volunteer to take her place. Her life is a tragic story, as are most protagonists; father killed when she was 11 or so and her mother slips into depression, leaving her to step up and assume the responsibilities of feeding her family. Her absent mother and dead father force Katniss to grow up too quickly, and she turns out rather emotionally shut off.<br /><br />All of this is fine, up to a point. But the first thing that started to break my immersion with the book was that from the beginning Katniss is painted as a pretty cold and calculating person. Even after volunteering to take her sister's place and thinking she was never going to make it back alive, she sheds no tears. But at a certain points throughout the second half and especially towards the end, Katniss is portrayed as being just like any other 16 year-old girl. Being irrational and overly emotional, when from the beginning she is supposed to be some distant and aloof loner, with only one real friend. There is no inherent problem in any of this. Maybe being forced to kill another human breaks something inside of her, and she has to confront these strange new emotions...<br /><br />But the problem is, that idea is never explored. When I was reading some of the critic's reviews of this book, one that piqued my interest said that the author explored the effect of war on children. Except there is no real exploration. We are told what happens, and given Katniss's reaction to it, without giving us the reasoning why she is reacting this way. Writing too much can be just as harmful to a book as not writing enough. There should be a happy medium though. It breaks my personal suspension of disbelief when I am presented with two conflicting ideas that the author is trying to create. Firstly, that Katniss is supposed to be logical and detached from the moment, and secondly that there are some emotional situations she just can't see to deal with without throwing an irrational and uncontrolled temper tantrum.<br /><br />Again, neither of these two ideas are conflicting necessarily, until you see the context they are presented in. She has no qualms about putting an arrow through the neck of a fellow combatant, but she freaks out when she has to contemplate which of the two heart-throbs she will choose. And that is the major flaw  in the book that I found. That towards the end especially, the book becomes about some stupid love triangle, and all I could think about was the Twilight saga and all the teenage drama. Emotional betrayal and the like. It is way too juvenile considering the darkness of the premise of the story. It's fine to have a romance sub-plot, it's even fine to write a book where The Hunger Games are secondary to the drama of the love triangle. But the major flaw in The Hunger Games is that for the first seven-eighths of the book the focus is almost entirely on the games themselves. And then suddenly the focus shifts to this completely unnecessary drama involving two great guys and this very flawed girl. You can't do that and maintain a theme. I felt the end of the book was all wrong in terms focus.<br /><br />However, I am not trying to turn anyone away from reading The Hunger Games. It's a good book. But I think you will probably get more out of it if you are in your teens (and I'm not being demeaning when I say that). The problem for me is that I have read a fair amount of books aimed at teenagers that pull off their premises without coming across as being completely out of place.end of the book was all wrong in terms focus.

B00005V9IK|4.0|This film is terrific. However, I do have one problem with it. There was absolutely no love between the older sister and the younger brother. It didn't seem to me like she loved him at all, whereas in \\"Mrs. Doubtfire,\\" she deeply cared about her siblings. But that was sorely missing in this movie. Scenes showing her care and concern for her brother should have been filmed. Also, more scenes showing Dylan with his mom (Vannessa Williams, excellent as usual) were needed. Same thing with the President's daughter and his wife. Good action, but more sentimentality was needed.

0743270754|5.0|Team of Rivals is simply remarkable and Doris Kearns Goodwin's scholarship is staggering.  The book opens with the Republican convention of 1860, and the struggle for the presidential nomination.  Abraham Lincoln was no one's first choice, but by deft political handling, became everyone's second choice, and the rest is history.  Lincoln rose to the occasion and it is difficult to imagine the Civil War and the struggle for emancipation without him.  The title refers to Lincoln's incorporation of his rivals for the nomination into his administration.  William Seward became his Secretary of State.  Edwin Stanton became his Secretary of War.  Salmon Chase became the Secretary of the Treasury and, subsequently, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and Edward Bates became Attorney General.  Watching the progress of the Civil War from the vantage of the White House puts the political and military elements in perspective.  Adding the struggles of family life and the often grudging support of former rivals into the mix provides insight into the challenges Lincoln faced on a day to day basis.  Goodwin illustrates how Lincoln grew into the job and how his political acumen sharpened with the passage of time.  Goodwin depicts not only the man in the top hat but also the family man.  We meet him in all his complexity and in all his simplicity and we empathize with him in his raw humanity.  Admirers of Mary Todd Lincoln will want to steer clear of this book because of Goodwin's warts-and-all depiction of her.  For most readers, though, Lincoln's lack of support at home only makes his achievements the more impressive.  For readers who read one five pound book a year, it would be hard to make a better selection than Team of Rivals.
0061784788|5.0|As a reader of all seven novels, I think of the characters as family, the most thrilling family evah! We have shared loss of friends and body parts, struggles with family and relationships and become cognizant of the latest developments in science and technology usually mixed with historical fiction.<br /> This is exactly what The Devil Colony offers. There are two missions that keep overlapping. In the first Painter Crowe, Kowalski and the geologist Chin are investigating the aftermath of a mysterious explosion in Utah. The fireworks were outside an ancient Native American cave containing mummified bodies and artifacts and the perpetrator may have been a young Native American activist Kai who is also Painter's niece. The other story line has Gray, Seichan and Monk investigating the true story of the Guild. (Sorry Rachel fans but this is Seichan's book.) At the end of the e-short story The Skeleton Key, Seichan receives papers embossed with The Great Seal of the United States containing clues to the Guild. She delivers them to Gray and their search is on!<br /> In true Rollins fashion, The Devil Colony is filled with historical and religious information concerning Native American, Mormons, Israelites and our Founding Fathers. Several times I paused to \\"wiki\\" some of the topics like the Caucasoid mummy remains or Chief Canasatego, as well as nano-bots and neutrinos. I love when my novels peak my curiosity and my adrenalin, and Rollins consistently delivers. There are many locales visited by the two groups but this time the majority of the action takes place in the United States. Painter's group journeys up and down the Rockies while Gray's stays east of the Mississippi (Iceland is east).<br /> While the action is fast and furious, what distinguishes Rollins from many others in this genre, is the balance of duty to country (or world) and duty to family. Gray's struggles with his father's Alzheimer's seem to weigh on him more than being caught in a volcanic eruption. Painter must decide how to deal with his niece Kai while heading off impending disaster. Kat, eight months pregnant, is left in charge of Sigma and must send her husband out on a life threatening mission.  Then there is the mutual attraction of Seichan and Gray. Her transformation over the last several novels from cold assassin to team member and even confidante has been subtle.  Will they or won't they? Of that, my lips are sealed.<br /> Do you need to read the previous books to enjoy The Devil Colony? No, but it will enhance your understanding and satisfaction. Just a note to the author, since when do books end with bombshells? Please don't make us wait too long before the next Sigma adventure.nter must decide how to deal with his niece Kai while heading off impending disaster.

0802473156|5.0|I love \\"The Five Love Languages\\" and have probably re-read this book about every six months or so.  I first became acquainted with the Five Love Languages by my sister, Amanda.  Amanda and her husband had enjoyed the original \\"The Five Love Languages\\" which is orientated towards couples and learned that Gary Chapman had another version geared more towards single people.  Its probably one of my favorite and most used gifts I've ever received.    I was excited about how insightful it was and think it definitely helped me improve and/or develop my relationship with my family members, friends, and, later on, my husband.     At my husband's and mine Engagement Encounter, I was excited when they touched on the five love languages because I was already very aware of the concept (having re-read the singles version three times at that point).  Engagement Encounter lead to me purchasing the \\"couples version\\".  I'm now finishing that one for the second time. (My husband hasn't read it yet but between the activities they had us do at Engagement Encounter and how I have a tendency to not shut up about things I get excited about it, he probably knows as much as if he had.....)    The basic concept of the book is that different things will make different people feel loved.  What makes Person A feel loved may not be the same thing that makes Person B feel loved.  There are five different main things that make a person feel loved (their Love Language): Words of Affirmation (me!!), Touch, Quality Time, Tasks (doing things for that person), and Gift Giving.  (Ha!! I've re-read the book so many times, I didn't even need to look to list those!!) Every person has a primary \\"love language\\" they speak and usually to a lesser degree one or two secondary languages.    Most people will gravitate towards people that speak their primary love language because receiving that \\"love\\" will fill their love tank; however, if a person is not receiving their primary love language it will cause their love tank to feel empty or unloved.    The trick is then learning what your partner, friend, co-worker, etc. speaks in order to communicate with them better.     Here's a website if you want to find out YOUR love language.  There is also an \\"Apology Language\\" quiz and a \\"Love Language for Kids\\" quiz that I found really interesting.  [...]    I was amazed at how this basic concept can be applied to dealing with all types of people and situations. Which is probably why I'll re-read the book again in about another 6 to 8 months.
B0052U59F4|5.0|This story had me captivated, and I couldn't put it down! Not only is it a sexy tale, but it's a little dangerous too. The author challenges the traditional romantic relationship and makes the reader question how far they'd go to be with someone. Well-told and well-paced, it's a solid read that left me desperate for the second installment! Can't wait!
B003V4AK8E|1.0|This controller is the worst 3rd party controller I have ever used. It has so many dead zones on it, its not even funny. The ps3 game Quantum Theory is literally unplayable with this controller. I've tried using this controller on Duke Nukem forever(It worked better on that game but still I could tell it had dead zones because the analog stick worked weird. When I moved it didn't move smoothly at all. The only game I got this controller to work good with was infamous 2, and thats midly good I still could tell the dead-zone on this controller. I'm really mad because so many ppl on youtube gave this controller great reviews. I only saw one youtube video of a 12 yr old saying the controller sucked, I didn't believe him because I thought he just had small hands but that little kid actually gave the most honest opinion about this controller. And don't be fooled by its looks, this controller really doesn't feel anything like a 360 controller(I'd know, I always play on my pc with my 360 controller(I don't like mouse and keyboard). The grips on it are plastic and not rubber like it looks like, its very uncomfortable because it cuts into your hands when you hold it even slightly tight. This controller is the complete opposite from what it looks like, the analog sticks do not feel smooth like the 360's controller. Also, the guy I ordered from sent me a junky version which required triple AAA batteries. Thats nice... But it doesn't matter thats just a minor problem with the controller I got. I was expecting to get the one that charges up on the ps3... I haven't tried any 3rd party controllers out on ps3 before but I have 3rd party controllers like MadCatz for ps2 and I cant tell you MadCatz usually makes great 3rd party controllers compared this garbage. Don't be fooled by the ppl on youtube(I really think they're ppl trying to sell this product probably because they have a stock in the product or they sell it at a game store).

0307477479|5.0|Having now read Jennifer Egan's award-winning and highly acclaimed novel, it is clear to me that this book and its author deserve every bit of praise heaped upon them thus far. The book introduces readers to Bennie Salazar, an aging and down-and-out music producer, and his assistant, Sasha, who experiences struggles of her own. Each chapter reveals parts of their past, told via the enthralling stories and lives of the many characters who enter and exit their lives.    What amazed me most about the book was how quickly I became totally engrossed in each separate (though not really!) character's short vignette. Egan creates a host of people that the reader comes to truly care about. The book is somewhat surprising and unique in its structure, as the author uses many different narrative forms to share each character's world, including second-person point of view narration, and even a slide presentation. Egan deftly intertwines the characters' distinct lives into one very readable work of modern fiction. I recommend this one to readers who enjoy literary fiction and 'character study'-type novels.
B0034G4P8K|3.0|I watch these movies (Transformers) for entertainment mainly. The acting is somewhat subpar.  I did like that the parents made an appearance, they were very funny.  I didn't really miss Megan Fox, but the new girl didn't add to much to the movie either. The action was very good as were the scenes, but I felt they could have shaved at least 30 minutes off the movie and still came out with the same results. I did think the beginning of the movie was more interesting than the end.
B00007KQA3|1.0|1984, 1985 film    \\"Who controls the present controls the future.\\" The people of Oceania are warned against the people of Eurasia, and an arch-traitor. The crowd reacts with emotion (like some TV show audiences). The banner if \\"Ingsoc\\" flies for adoration. We see people working in cubicles. Big Brother is watching you! One man works at rewriting history (what newspapers and magazines usually do). [The coughing of Winston Smith must symbolize the tuberculosis of George Orwell, a disease that can arise from a poor diet due to war-time rationing.] Society is very regimented. Production statistics are faked; there are shortages. [Another reference to wartime rationing.] People are entertained by public hangings [like some current reality shows], and news about increased rations (really a decrease). The confessions of the condemned may reference Stalin's purge trials (a successor of Byzantine intrigues). Winston Smith finds a used goods store.    \\"War is Peace. Ignorance is Strength.\\" Crowds cheer the executions of prisoners. [Most people find happiness in other people's suffering.] The \\"V\\" sign is a national symbol. A couple meet in the woods where it is safer. Does the existence of families threaten Ingsoc? [Or corporate power?] Real food is highly valued (as in wartime Europe). Smith is offered a newer dictionary with up-to-date definitions. Are old nursery rhymes outlawed as \\"politically incorrect\\"? Smith changes the history books. \\"Eurasia has always been our ally.\\" A flashback tells of Winston's past. [Note the rats.] O'Brien lectures Smith about \\"thought criminals\\". They spread knowledge from generation to generation. Winston finds a secret in that new book. Essays on the workings of society sound radical, or real. There is a shocking surprise! Another man in jail is a \\"thought criminal\\" even if he didn't know it. Will he be sent to a labor camp?    Smith is tortured for the sake of torture. The questions are like religious dogma, where the wrong answer brings damnation. \\"How many fingers?\\" \\"Reality is in the human mind.\\" Collective memory is immortal. \\"I don't know.\\" Breaking the will? O'Brien explains their method of annihilation. \\"You do not exist.\\" Power exists by inflicting pain. The future is a boot stamping on a human face forever. Does society create human nature? Is Winston on the wrong side of history? [Is this movie starting to drag and becoming too talky?] Rats are known to attack infants and sick people. Winston breaks down now. Next we see Julia and Winston in the \\"Chestnut Tree Café\\". They talked. \\"We must meet again.\\" Smith takes a drink. He loved Big Brother now.    \\"1984\\" was a satire of England and the world of 1948. The wartime Allies became enemies in the Cold War. The British, Dutch, and French lost their colonies. Some won independence through war, others had their independence compromised. Can a philosophical novel be adapted to a movie? I think \\"The Darkness at Noon\\" was a better story (based on actual events). Could \\"television\\" be used to control the thinking of people? [Yes, its working now.]  During the war all telephone calls were monitored by the British Secret Police. Orwell had to use \\"television\\" as a stand-in else he would be in violation of the Official Secrets Act and convicted. The book is better than the film.

B004SGWYW4|4.0|I should point it out so it is clearly visible.  The OVA is NOT in the US release (hopefully if there is another season, it will go in that set).  And aren't they using the title \\"Complete Collection\\" a little early?  It's not complete now, and we don't know for sure that more won't be animated.    The annoying part, is that the OVA was known about long ago, so either nobody did their research, the contracts were done way too early, or like many anime brought over to the US, the local producers refused to spring for the extra material licensing.  I've been thinking the latter on a lot of recent releases since I keep seeing info stating 2.0 dolby on shows that were broadcast in 5.1 AC-3.  Not sure if that is the case here, though.    We're watching this at our anime club, and other than the rather amazed impression the super-breast-overdose with slo-mo and bullet-dodging was, in terms of animation... most of the members (including me) thought the extreme over-the-top fanservice was annoying, unnecessary (the story and characters were plenty sufficient without it), and distracting. It degraded the story and experience. The slapped-in-the-face with mammaries experience could only have been worse if done in 3D.    It's worth seeing, even with all that. Those impressed enough by it... go track down the manga...  Just, please, don't, let, Hollywood, get, ahold, of, this!
B004NSULHM|5.0|Maybe this album isn't for everyone, maybe people just aren't giving it a chance, but I think The King of Limbs is one of Radiohead's best works. And that is saying A LOT. Don't expect In Rainbows 2.0 or 'anything you've ever heard' 2.0, this album is quite a new experience, and you'll like it more every time you listen to it. Hopefully TKOL will go down in history the same way Kid A did: initially confusing and angering a lot fans (check), but eventually recognized and remembered as the beautiful album that it really is.
B0028K3192|5.0|I know i'm late on leaving a review but his CD still jams!! I can listen to every song on the CD without skipping! At first I didn't like some of the songs but they grew on me and then I began to relate..\\" how can you be so coollldddd\\"...<br /><br />I  don't knowt the point of having a song on the cd with just music, but when I get off work that track jams! I let my windows down and just enjoy the melody. This CD wasn't \\"awesome\\" but it surely deserves 5 stars. I still listen to it often in the summer of 2011 like it just dropped.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great camera case, the thickness of the cushioning is awesome and allows you to know the even if you drop it your camera is fine Ive drop mine a few times and not even a scratch on my lcd screen (which has no protector it. All the pockets come in handy sense i am a photography student. Being a backpack makes it so much easier to go threw the doorways in the building , you dont have to worry about waking it on the door frame cause its on your back.I love mine and if anything was to happen to it id would buy another one that is exactly the same. Also the price is perfect cause most stores such as bestbuy or walmart want almost $60 for ones that have wayyy! less padding.Finally the interchangeable section inside of the large packet make it easier to accommodate the size of any camera or any accessories you may have or want to carry with you.

B002BJGYUS|2.0|I order the first season of the Gilmore Girls.  I love this series. I wore my origional new set out. I had tried earlier to buy a like new copy and was disappointed. This set disappointed me as well. The disc jacket and \\"Pages \\" were not joined and disc 3 and 4 had stops and scratches on them. Again a waste of money.Their description of this set wa so nice I knew there would not be any problems. I was wrong.
B004RLPTT0|1.0|Been hearing the movie is a dud but thought \\"well at least there's some killer music to come out of it.\\" Apparently not. The samples and the concept of new artists doing interesting takes on a few cool classic songs made it seem like this was going to be good. I'll give it another listen but right now the verdict is \\"all concept and no heart.\\" Isn't that what's generally said about the movie too? Bummer, what a waste of money and production.
1433502410|2.0|All would be well with the ESV study Bible; however, the binding is the same lousy, shoddy craftsmanship that I see in all of their Bible publications.  This Bible is JUST NOT acceptable.[[ASIN:1433524708 ESV Study Bible, Personal Size (TruTone, Olive, Celtic Cross Design)]]
B0057KXXFM|5.0|I know that this is album that many people will love, but most will hate it because it's \\"cool\\" these days to hate on Limp Bizkit.  In my opinion though, this album is something fresh amid the crap that has ruled the airwaves for the last decade.  As soon as I bought it it made me feel like I was in high school again, instead of wanting to bash my head against the wall from the Justin Beiber/Gaga crap today.  Lyrically, the album is nothing to write home about but Wes Borland and crew make up for the bad lyrics with awesome rock and roll.  Limp Bizkit never was a band to be taken too seriously, and it's great to see them back and not changing their style just because it isn't the cool thing now.  BIZKIT FOR LIFE!

B004NJC0B6|4.0|I feel kind of ripped off here. I know fans have been screaming for this to be released on DVD for years now, but then again, quite alot of us have had bootleg copies of the thing on DVD where they took the audio from the album released with the Bonfire box set, and had 5.1 surround sound... I'm not going to complain about the sound of this DVD, it's not nearly as bad as some have said it is, sure, it may be 2.0 or what not, but at least the images have been cleaned up a bit from the old VHS transfers.     Some others have complained that the footage hasn't been given the best treatment; but that is because the original film was lost in a flood or fire or something in the early 90's, and is gone. This probably came a duplicated reel or possibly VHS or Beta tape or something, but it is still better then bootleg quality.     However, what I am annoyed at. I had already heard the sound wasn't 5.1, and people where already shouting the bootleg is the better choice, but I thought I would pick this up, because A) it's official AC/DC, and B) bonus goodies. But low and behold, I open my package to see the cover says nothing about any extras, and then I pop the disc in and find there is nothing at all. What the heck is this? Why is there 3 versions of this being released? A regular DVD, a Blue Ray and a special edition? Come on... this is not fair to the fans.

0060775858|2.0|I bought this book for my 6 month old baby based on the mostly good reviews it had. However I found that it is very hard to put the book in front of her and read aloud as she tended to grab the pages of the book. It would be great if the book is a board book. The pages of the book are also big and thin which made it quite difficult to flip the pages. I found the colors very dull but I guess there might be a purpose to it as it is a goodnight book. I have stopped reading this book for my baby and will probably try again when she is older.
0307269752|2.0|I agree with the negative reviews on here.  This was a poorly written, poorly translated (I hope!) and overall fairly boring book.  I don't understand the hype at all.  The publishing house has a very good marketing department.  I really felt taken because this was supposed to be SUCH an insightful and stirring read.  It was not at all.  Yes it is a quick read only because it is easy to read quickly - and not in a good way.  Please don't waste your time with this mystery (the mystery of the well-reviewed book).  Plenty of cliches (\\"dead as a doornail\\"???), and clumsy sentences.  Characters that you really don't care about.  And extremely violent situations that just seem so out of place.  Spend your $ elsewhere.
0345529057|3.0|I'm quite sure the story itself, if marvelous (I'm reading it via the Kindle my son just gave me for my birthday), but the size of the books is not clear to me by titles like \\"mass media\\" \\"paperback.\\" They are both paperback. I have a disability that makes it very hard to hold books that are too small, yet thick (as these were), or too big and heavy (as hard backs often are). I think it must be the \\"trade book\\" size that fits my hands and lets me turn the pages, but as it is also paperback, I am uncertain even of that choice. I LOVE books and have fought owning a kindle as I support free press and independent book stores, but the Kindle, in a case, is just the right size (though I want to \\"turn the page\\" by scrolling, rather than pushing that button), so my issue with this bundle of books is simply they are too small for my hands to manage, to hold, to turn the pages, and do not reflect on the story, which I am very much enjoying.
0670022411|1.0|This book was a huge let down. The first few chapters were promising... The author created what I thought was an intriguing mystery, but turns out to be not interesting enough. There was a lot of suspense with the presence of new characters (hoards of demons, witches, and vampires). However, it all goes down hill during the endless chapters dedicated to Diana and Matthew. Their story was no story at all. Completely like Twilight in the worst way possible. It was first hate, then the next second love. Their courtship was merely eating, drinking wine and Matthew being overprotective. The romance was boring, and there was too much of it--not enough magic and history. Also, I thought that the main character, Diana, was one of the weakest I have read. She had little personality, especially for being an accomplished woman and someone as unique as herself. She became completely dependent on Matthew very fast. She trusted him immediately, which was weird (since vamps and witches don't interact regularly). Just blegh. This book is advertised as the complete opposite of what it is. It's on the top of a lot of reading lists. How? I don't know... Here's to hoping that there will be more publicized negative reviews.
B000JML7EC|4.0|The book itself was good and I read it faster than I have other classics. One thing that bothered me was how short some lines were and how others went the full width of the screen. The lines were laid out in a non-sensical way. In books it is usually obvious why a line would be short but this was just the opposite. It didn't make me want to stop reading because I enjoyed the story but it seemed odd that the ebook would be set up like that.
0439023521|3.0|I was curious about this book as it appears to be the next \\"big\\" trilogy due to its being adapted into a movie (ala \\"Harry Potter\\" and \\"Twilight\\"). From reading about it, I was interested, but cautious, as its premise seems rather familiar to those who have read or seen the Japanese classic \\"Battle Royale,\\" in which the government picks a group of school children to fight to the death as a way to keep the populace in line. \\"Hunger Games\\" has a very similar plot, taking place in a post global warming world where what is left of North America has been renamed and split into twelve (once thirteen) districts, who must submit a boy and girl to the annual fight to the death called The Hunger Games as a reminder for them not to try to rebel again.<br />Despite constantly reminding me of \\"Battle Royale,\\" (and the movie of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" with the weird Capitol outfits)the book did suck me in, and I very much wanted to keep reading. However, after thinking about it for a bit, I think it is more the ideas than the actual execution of the book that kept me interested. The writing itself is not very mature. It has many fragmented sentences that I would re-read, trying to find out where the rest of it was because it was incomplete. It is also written in the first person, which is currently very popular for young adult and fantasy/supernatural books whose intended audience is female. This first person account can be interesting, but is also one to be careful with- it is very easy to make the protagonist seem superficial and whiny to the point of annoyance. I didn't feel this too often about Katniss, except when it came to the relationship with Peeta. This relationship, which strengthened the book in some areas (especially at the end of the Hunger Games), also was one of the weakest areas. I wanted to roll my eyes every time Katniss would think about having to pretend \\"to be madly in love.\\" It simply got old, and fast.<br />I do plan on reading the next two books because they are fun and the first ended in a place that really made me want to start the second right away. Yet, I hope that the actual writing gets better, so that Collins' ideas can be better expressed.are fun and the first ended in a place that really made me want to start the second right away.

0061928356|5.0|If I had a dollar for every moment I've wasted time playing the \\"what if\\" game, I could retire rich and read fabulous books all day long. And how wonderful would that be?<br /><br />But since that will never happen, allow me to share a few of the many questions I preoccupy myself with:<br /><br />What if my father hadn't been fortunate enough to escape India for America? Is it possible that I would have been born into poverty and lived a very different life? What if, when I was born, my dad decided he couldn't afford a daughter and he left me at an orphanage? Where would I be now? Or, what if he'd found a clinic that performed gender identification ultrasounds?<br /><br />Is it possible that I wouldn't exist at all?<br /><br />Secret Daughter explores many of life's \\"what -ifs.\\" This is the story of two families who - due to both necessity and survival - make decisions that affect them for the rest of their lives. Author Gowda writes this book from several points of view, including those of a birth mother and an adoptive mother who have nothing in common except that they fight to love a daughter they've both won and lost. This story is also from the point of view of the daughter in question - Asha - who is pulled in so many directions and ultimately finds that what she was looking for was right under her nose the entire time.<br /><br />From the character driven chapter structure to the honest writing; from the admirable characters to the difficult life choices - this book is nothing short of phenomenal.  The reader can't help but be drawn to the characters as they battle their own demons and insecurities, as they struggle to relate and survive, and as they fight to hold on to what little they have.<br /><br />Most importantly, however, is the fact that the shocking plight of the people we pretend don't exist will touch, fascinate, amaze, and inspire those of us who are fortunate enough to read this beautiful book.<br /><br />Bottom Line: The only thing wrong with this book is the fact that author Shilpi Somaya Gowda has set the bar so high with her debut novel that I fear nothing I write will ever come close.<br /><br />Ameena Din<br />Freelance Reviewer<br />Fancy That...Fancy Thisset the bar so high with her debut novel that I fear nothing I write will ever come close.

B004A8ZX28|4.0|Because of the negative reviews, particularly those from fans of \\"Taken\\", I had hesitated much to pick \\"Unknown\\" up. Finally, I gave in to the attraction of Neeson and the marcom effort of the filmmaker. I am obliged to tell you that this is the best thriller action movie I saw this year. Not as good as \\"Taken\\", which is a classic, but not far behind, with a more captivating twist. For a night's entertainment after a day's hard work, this movie easily hits your target. For those who have higher preference of story over action, go for it at once. You will thank me for it.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|I normally don't review movies unless it can really move me or the movie was really horrible. I am super picky and take nothing in life as it comes without looking at it from all angles. I can usually tear apart a movie within minutes of watching it. My friends hate watching movies news or TV shows with me because I don't miss a beat, I see all mistakes and holes instantly. But the reason I am doing a review on this movie is because In my opinion it really kicked ass but then again its only my opinion. I would have changed very little, a few things I would have changed is when the kid appeared in the second house when he changed the music and started dancing it killed the creepiness of the mood. He should have just been standing in front of the record player after he changed the music. Then when she tracked him down the way he jumped out of the cabinet kind of killed the mood the bad acting kind of threw me off. Then when the family who was shot by the smiling girl showing the act of the murders happened it kind of killed the mood and pace again you could tell they where trying too hard to weird you out. Other than that this movie gets on to a fast moving pace and doesn't stop and the spirits start showing up right away. I love the concepts and idea's in this movie the astral projection seemed really interesting to me. It may be a hodge podge of a few other movies but they did a good job at what they put together and don't take to much from single film in the past. It seems like the 1st half of the movie is much scarier than the second and it seemed like it became hard for the director to finish off such an excellent 1st half. Now my point here is I have been through hell in real life and the fear in my brain has vanished after being so terrified in my life, coming close to death many times over and over again until my fears finally vanished. But this movie really creped me out and had me looking over my shoulder in my place after I finished watching it. This movie made me feel alive again lol. What I really liked is it was a blind watch, I knew nothing of the movie before I viewed it. This will be a day one blu ray buy for me. I highly recommend this movie if you are a horror movie fan, and I dare anyone to watch it all by themselves in an empty house. When you have accomplished this mission let me know lol..........................UPDATE........Wholy Crap I played this bluray on my 7.2 surround setup wich has 4,800 watts of subs and it put out some of the lowest bass I have heard in a while.

0061438294|3.0|I got this together with \\"Louder than words\\" by the same author. I read this first and so my reviews will be written in the same order. In short, I am a little bit disappointed. Dont know whether I had watched too much CSI, House and Mentalist that my high expectation had not been met, particularly on how to tell whether somebody is lying or not. The information provided is definitely more than common sense, yet it is not detailed enough to make a high probability judgement. Fine for leisure, but quite insufficient for reading someone's mind. In case you simply want to improve your chance in your career by knowing more about what the other persons are feeling about you, please read \\"Louder than words\\" instead.<br /><br />p.s. Below please find a few of my favorite passages for your reference.<br />If you are dealing with a person who is socializing or cooperative with you, his or her feet should mirror your own. If, however, someone's feet are pointed away from you while his body faces toward you, you should ask yourself why. Pg76<br />Predators lurk about waiting for their next victim; therefore their postures and pace are different. There is no purposeful direction to their travel until they are about to strike. Pg77<br />During a holdup is probably the only time individuals will simultaneously keep their hands high and be unhappy. Pg111<br />One of the best ways to establish rapport with someone is to touch that person on the arm, somewhere between the elbow and the shoulder. Pg132

I was in the process of starting a brand new company and getting ready to throw in the towel, then one afternoon I stumbled upon this book and soaked it in over lunch. It changed my attitude and perspective on my company and the resistance we were facing. The resistance seemed too much but this book taught me to see it as something that could be beaten with enouh will and passion. Today, largely because of Pressfields words, we are past that resistance and facing some new challenges, but with much more confidence and intention than the previous ones.<br /><br />If you're trying to start something new and you're getting ready to quit, buy this book. It might save your business, your relationships, or it might save your life.

0307595862|5.0|Nesbo has written some great Harry Hole novels. If you read no other read this one. It will keep you on the edge of your seat from begining to end. When I thought I had it figured out, 'bang' a twist happens and I was back to trying to figure out 'who done it'. There are references to previous novels, but if you have not read them it will not ruin this story. After you read 'Snowman' you will probably want to read the previous ones,('Redbreast', 'Devils Star', etc.).

0783225857|5.0|How do you review a film like this? The casting is perfect. The story is told in an effective but not sensational manner. Just hearing the first few seconds of the main theme can bring a smile to your face. The scene where the two children are talking about their mother while their dad sits alone in the swing will break your heart. I've watched this movie dozens and dozens of times and will continue to watch it from time to time simply because it is perfect.
B004G6009U|5.0|A very family friendly movie that is not only funny, but a great story as well. Loosely based on the story of Rapunzel, it stays a lighthearted adventure that doesn't insult anyone. Disney is very much on track these days putting out the types of movies we all enjoyed in the past that you could take the family to see and not worry about obnoxious characters that set bad examples. My wife and I enjoyed it and agreed to get it for the children, and the grandchildren to enjoy. If you like the classic Disney movies you will probably enjoy it.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br />Rapunzel is kidnapped and kept in a tower so that she may keep an evil woman young with her magic hair. When a thief climbs into her tower trying to escape the law he learns it is not wise to enter without announcing themself. Rapunzel strikes a bargain with the thief to escape the tower and see the town. As the thief avoids the law he does his best to show Rapuzel what she has missed locked away in the tower. All good fun as they are chased and make new friends and become close to each other. If you enjoyed this movie, be sure to see [[ASIN:B0049GYXCC Enchanted [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />CA Luster
1410430103|5.0|A number of people have recommended this author to me, knowing that I enjoy reading mysteries and suspense novels. So, I read this book, the first in the series featuring Jack Reacher, an ex-military policeman who is now a drifter.  Reacher is a really intriguing character and the details provided in this book about currency and counterfeiting were also fascinating. I definitely plan to continue reading the other books in this series.
B004LAIU4I|4.0|I've always liked Paul Simon.  I used to like him mostly for his music, but now am finally starting to really listen to his lyrics.  Like others who get far enough along in life to be able to look backwards (Neil Diamond, Frank Sinatra, and many others come to mind) with new perspective, Simon is now trying his hand at it.  You'll find undertones of disenchantment, some cynicism, some criticism of what's not the way it \\"should\\" be.  But interwoven with the lyrics you'll also find a musical overlay that somehow says . . . life's not everything it should be . . . but it's still good nevertheless.  And love still makes it all worthwhile.  I still like Paul Simon -- only now I better understand why!
0812973992|5.0|Good read about New York City in the 1970s. The descriptive writing of the author makes this book. The 1970s era was a heart wrenching time for many people and a reminder of what the Twin Towers were and the grief brought to America with 9/11. The author hints at historical events during the time of the story, but doesn't bog down the reader.
B003Y74AZ2|4.0|For the price, it's hard to beat this. I personally prefer silicone cases over hard ones because they are easier to grip and typically absorb more shock on falls (not true in every case, just the general rule). The amazon case works as described.     There are only 2 slight cons (which knocked it from a 5 to a 4 star)    1. Case is a slight loose fit. Its not coming off but if you put it in your jeans pocket and take it out one of the corners might come off. Not really a huge deal, but a hassle sometimes.    2. Seems to attract a slight bit of dust/pet dander.     Overall I would purchase this again.
044654759X|5.0|This is a rather captivating story written by Nicholas Sparks about a young woman who manages to escape from her abusive husband and start a new life in North Carolina.

Assisted by a speech therapist who gradually becomes his unlikely friend, as well as his loving wife, Queen Elizabeth (we knew her as the Queen Mother), the king finds the courage that inspires and leads the British people through this most trying time.<br /><br />The movie delivers several wonderful performances, especially Colin Firth's King. His agony each time he speaks publicly or faces a radio microphone seems palpable.<br /><br />An absolute gem.
B0034G4P8K|5.0|I don't understand why people didn't like Revenge of the Fallen. I thought that was great. I thought that the first Transformers the best... Until I saw Dark of the Moon. Dark of the Moon was just a perfect movie. It had comedy, suspense, and (Most importantly) action. Some of these action sequences were just great. And there were some white knuckling sequences that you HAVE to be prepared for. And Shia LaBoef was just great with the new actress. She was better than Megan Fox. In more than one way if you know what I mean =) But altogether, this was an A+ in my book. So dissapointed that it's the final one. Michael Bay, this was your MASTERPIECE!

B004SBQGHS|1.0|For the second time, an update has wiped out my entire history. The same thing happened with the AB Space update that was just released. Let's see, should I waste a lot of time reaching the same useless milestones that I -- and tens of millions of others -- have already \\"achieved\\" just to have it all thrown away on a whim? Again? Or should I uninstall all four AB games and move on? Yah. I also uninstalled Amazon's App Store, which has its own list of problems.
0345529057|5.0|I love to read, but George R.R. Martin's books have completly captured me. He has created such a vivid universe you can see it in every page, and such strong characters you can almost hear them breathe. There is nothing predictable in the stories being told. You will be surprised with every twist and turn the plots take.  I have laughed and cried and felt fear.  This had not happened to me in a very long time with a novel. I am currently reading volumen III and I cannot wait to put my hands of the fourth volume, and the fifth (which is coming out July 12).
B002ZBT84G|4.0|I'd give this 4.5 stars if possible.    Yes, the tracks are short. Yes, it lacks much of the head-on social commentary that he's known for. And it isn't terribly funky. But it's so. personal. This is Gil Scott-Heron reflecting on his life journey in the now, and he's invited us into the room to have a listen as he muses.    He's still an amazing poet. His voice has changed, and it reflects his life. The sweet rawness and confession in the title track with its chorus of optimism is something else. From a man who has never seen the world with rose-colored glasses, his belief in redemption and forgiveness of the self is inspiring. \\"New York is Killing Me\\" and \\"Me and the Devil\\" are also stand-out tracks.    I hope the messengers are listening.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|Battle: Los Angeles is a modern war movie told from the perspective of a platoon of US Marines thrown into battle against invading extraterrestrials attempting to take Los Angeles and filmed as if a documentary team was embedded with the unit. The result is a movie that almost looks like it was filmed in the heat and chaos of the intense firefights in Fallujah, Iraq rather than the ruined streets of Santa Monica and Los Angeles. The film begins with their initial contact with an unknown enemy possessing overwhelming firepower while trying to rescue civilians trapped in a police station in Santa Monica, trying to survive and escape while completely cut off from all support and finally rallying to try and destroy the aliens' command and control center against overwhelming odds. The freeway scene depicting the Marines trying to save civilians while trying to hold off the advancing aliens is especially nail biting and reminds me a lot of the intensity of the Omaha beach scene in Saving Private Ryan. The disadvantage of filming this way is that documentary style films are not big on character development unless you have a lot of quiet moments to observe each soldier. You therefore only get a superficial sense of the characters of each of the soldiers who make up main characters in this film but in the context of this film, that's enough to tell this narrative. The dialogue isn't memorable, but then documentary films aren't generally known for memorable dialogue from their subjects either. Other than the absence (for the most part) of f-bombs, the dialogue sounds pretty authentic as far as how soldiers would communicate to each other when performing their mission in the heat of battle. What this film excels at is watching how these soldiers start from being a diverse group who had never been in combat to becoming a cohesive unit fiercely loyal to each other and to their staff sergeant Nantz played by Aaron Eckhart by the end of the film. The only real criticism I have isthe whole subplot about Nantz and Cpl Lockart's brother, who died during Nantz last tour in Iraq. I think the scriptwriter missed an opportunity to emphasize instead a bond between Iraq war vets Nantz and Kern (played by Jim Parrack who plays Hoyt Fortenberry in HBO's True Blood), just like Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore's characters in Saving Private Ryan and Mal Reynolds and Zoe in Firefly/Serenity.

B004RQVVGU|5.0|\\"Diary\\" and \\"Blizzard\\" are two of my favorite albums of all time. The thing I wasn't a fan of was the final production of them and therefore didn't listed to both for years. I passed on the mid-nineties reissues due to poor reviews and also the later reissues because they were a fraud. But man let me tell you...These latest issues of both albums are just excellent! You will here every note Bob and Lee played where you couldn't on the originals. Of course, Randy's guitars are screaming and bright but not to the point of overpowering the others' performances. These two albums sound so sonically superior to the originals that you will think you are hearing these songs for the first time! You won't even be tired of \\"Crazy Train\\" anymore. You have to get both at the same time or you will wish you did.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|I bought this movie for my 7 year old daughter after reading the story in one of her story books.  She really enjoyed reading the story so I thought she would like to see the movie.  She loved the movie!  It is a great family movie that everyone can enjoy.  I would definitely recommend this DVD for all ages and for family movie nights.
0156027321|2.0|I'm writing about the style of the book, and from the beginning of Pi's auto-narration there are some low themes and motifs: Firstly, Pi is simplistic; he goes so far as to shun balanced views and the greater perspective and realism and economics, and downright anti-intellectualism. A small-minded kid is sometimes acceptable as a protagonist such as Huckleberry Finn or a bildungsroman such as Amory Blaine, but Pi doesn't learn and mature, and in the end we are left with the feeling that the Author is siding with a bigoted small-minded simpleton protagonist who demonizes any logicalness in agnosticism and throws blanket arguments to defend all animals in captivity in zoos.  I don't mind opposing views but they must be well-rounded and they must be respectful to counter-arguments. Martel creates a straw-man logic-driven antagonist in the men who listen to Pi's story, and  [SPOILER ALERT]    Despite Martel's fanciful made-up world, he leaves out some key factors in determining the truth from lies in the story (and that is what matters to me and many other people who want to hear the truth no matter how fanciful a delusion can be. What's Martel trying to do? Promote delusions? Is he an atheist making a low joke at religion?)  the key factors between determining the truth are \\"if the meercat bones are still around as Pi said, they could easily be used to determine if a tiger bit into them. if the boat in which Pi resided for hundreds of days was still full of meercat bones then tiger-hair would be locatable if a tiger was ever present.\\"    What's ironic is that to find the truth in this story, one would need to be a sceptic and listen to every side of the story without predilection toward beauty or nicety and go to the boat to find all the facts and find the degree of delusion the kid had. And scepticism is what Pi had ranted against since the beginning of the novel.
B002ZG99IG|5.0|I loved this movie who wouldn't want to see lieghten meester play psycho and almost light a guy on fire and say that he was a pussy.

0439023521|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my 13 year old son who is an avid reader. I only obliged because he read To Kill A Mockingbird on my suggestion. With an attitude of \\"Ok, let me get through this kiddie book\\", I made it through page one. By the time I got to around page 10 I was engrossed! I did not want to stop reading to cook or clean or do anything! I was told by my son that there is a movie version coming out. This saddens me because there is no way a movie will be able to capture the heart of this book. OAN, he loved To Kill a Mockingbird and I'm on book two of Hunger Games trilogy!
B001HN6922|2.0|So, you've got an evil clandestine organization of Pacers and Gremlins (made by American Motor Cars) who work for an evil German monocle wearing stereotype who together are sitting on the largest new oil field in the world (owned by the Americans and defended by US Navy Independence Class frigates) and some british spy cars that are trying to defeat them.  Americans bad.  Big oil bad.<br /><br />The irony is that all these adorable cars are trying to get rid of the fuel they were designed to run on because they'd rather run on \\"alternative fuels\\" that don't exist yet, much like so many Americans want to run away from their own greatness for some utopia wonder-world that exists in their imagination.<br /><br />Oh, and since this movie has dredged the 1970's for some of the most awful cars, how about some exploding Ford Pintos?  I would have added another star if I'd seen some of those.  At least try to see it once before you pay cash for a clunker.<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br />Edit 11/20/2011<br />Got to see the movie again without spending any money.  In the 23rd minute of the movie it is explained that the Americans \\"discovered\\" this \\"biggest oil reserve in the world\\".  What the Americans discovered was the platforms already existing and being controlled by evil lemon cars.  So, the drilling platforms were not themselves owned by Americans.  An American agent was working with the brit spies.  So, I missed that and I'll admit that I was wrong.<br /><br />I changed the title of my review to remove \\"anti-American\\", but I still think the whole thing is a preachy propaganda piece that I have no desire ever to see again.
B0058FOB2K|5.0|i'm really happy that Beyonce is getting rave reviews. The more I started listening to this album, the more my opinions on 4 changed. I was initially disappointed in its lyrics. I was thinking that there is no diversity and the majority are just sappy love songs. The central focus is on love and female empowerment. I didn't wanna hear about making love and kissy face mushy stuff. There were times where I had to cringe. Otherwise, it's a much better improvement from Sasha Fierce but I still can't top it with B'Day. 4 DOES feel more like Dangerously In Love pt. 2. In some songs, she does bring back DIL and Sasha Fierce. She's definately taking risks this era by firing her father as her manager. You're not going to find alot of uptempos like Single Ladies or Crazy in Love. It's mostly comprised of power ballads and midtempos. I love the throwbacks of the early 80s-early 90s. I grew up listening to alot of that but I wish she had the kind of lyrics that would make me more crazy about this album. I'm not saying that this is a bad album. It sounds really good. They were like only 3 out of 15 songs that I can relate to in a personal way. I don't think the love lyrics in some songs would appeal to all listeners in a universal sense. Maybe to people who are at their greatest moment in their life.<br /><br />1 + 1 (3.5/5)- aside from the mushy, over the top lyrics, she sings it beautifully. it does have that special, intimate feeling once you listen to the melody. i love the 80s soft rock ballad feel to it.<br /><br />I Care (5/5)-sounds like it would easily fit in with alicia's as i am album. i wasn't really feeling the beat especially those bland la, la, la, la at my initial response but it's a grower. i can actually relate to the lyrics.<br /><br />I Miss You (4/5)-now this song sounds like alicia's element of freedom. the chords are very similar to ones on that album. i find the lyrics to be relatable.<br /><br />Best Thing I Never Had (5/5)-I wish the album had more songs like this. It's the best thing I've heard on this album. I love it when Beyonce shows her fierce and angry side. I wanna see more of that on here instead of this mushy, submissive side.<br /><br />Party (5/5)-Definately one of the highlights of the album. I like Andre 3000's better than J. Cole's one.<br /><br />Rather Die Young (5/5)-this the only love song I can really tolerate. I can relate to some of what the lyrics are the saying. The song itself takes me back to the music of Regina Bell and Deniece Williams.<br /><br />Start Over (3/5)-I would skip this one. I'm not feeling this one. It's about making up after having a fight.<br /><br />Love on Top (5/5)-this song really brought my attention. It really sounds like early 80s music. She did a good job. She really delivered vocally on this song. Bravo!<br /><br />Countdown (5/5)-initially, i was not crazy about this song or the beats. it displays her love and devotion over a man.<br /><br />End of Time (4.5/5)-i guess you can say it's her own version of Lionel's All night Long upon listening to the drums in the background.<br /><br />I Was Here (4/5)-she talks about how she's done it all and seen it all. a very nice ballad.<br /><br />Run The World (4.5/5)-honestly my first reaction was what was Beyonce thinking when she did this song?? I love how it's all about female empowerement...but it sounds overproduced and all over the place. not a good follow-up to single ladies. It starting to grow on me , though<br /><br />Deluxe edition:<br /><br />Lay Up Under Me (4/5) -bleh...i could do without this song. it's about spending a cozy evening at home and enjoying those special moments with your lover. the lyrics are pretty redundant.<br /><br />Schoolin Life (5/5)- I'm in love with this song! she goes through all the different stages of everyone's lives. she should have included this on the standard edition to make up for those filler tracks like Start Over.<br /><br />Dance For You (5/5)-My first reaction to this song was \\"Here we go again with the mushy, generic, submissive songs again\\". And now I LOVE this song! It's all I ever listened to. It just makes me want to booty pop. The lyrics and the beats flow so well together. i think it's her most sensually song she ever put out. it tells me she's in a place where she is at her most comfort. It reminds me of Cater 2 u and janet's sex kitten songs. BEST song to strip for your man!!!<br /><br />I'm not gonna even bother to rate the remixes...<br /><br />Average rating: 4.5ng was \\"Here we go again with the mushy, generic, submissive songs again\\".

B003P2WO5E|5.0|And it was, overall, pretty amazing.     \\"The Way of Kings\\" starts off slow, and for quite some time not a whole lot seems to happen. That's half the beauty of the book, though. By the end, you realize how much you were really being told in the first several chapters; how important it all was.     Some of what are probably intended to be twists and turns or somewhat telegraphed, but there are corners you turn completely blind.    I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in Sanderson's other work or anyone who has an interest in good, solid, fantasy books.
B00138KJU4|4.0|Just listened to Arrival again to compare it wtih the new release Eclipse. It holds up very well and is still a solid album. \\"Higher Place\\" sets the tone of the album which frankly is a bit on the somber side for a rock album but this is a good opener. Immediately after,however, comes the first of 5 ballads on the album which brings the momentum of the CD down to a crawl. Some will argue that there are really 4 ballads but I count \\"live and breathe\\" as a ballad. The speed kinda picks up again with \\"Signs of Life\\" but Jonathan Caine's piano is heavy in the mix and hearkens back to \\"Don't stop believin\\". \\"All the things\\" is a heavy rocker and a bit of departure but then its right back to the piano ballad with the very pretty \\"loved by you\\". \\"Livin' to do' is one of my favorites and quite bluesy but again a slow song. \\"World gone wild\\" has a quicker tempo and overtones of Eddie Van Halen on the guitar. \\"I got a reason\\" is a good mid-tempo rocker. Then the flow of the album hits a dam with the trio of ballads, \\"with your love\\", lifetime of dreams\\", and the aforementioned \\"live and breathe\\". Some good trimming by the producer would have helped here. But all is not lost, as the album picks up steam again with the rocking \\"nothin' comes close\\" and \\"to be alive again\\". Whew. There are still two to go. \\"kiss me softly\\" is mid-tempo and different for Journey. Nice nylon string acoustic solo work too. The album finally closes with the anthemic \\"we will meet again.\\" The album would have been much better at 10 or 12 songs rather than an ear numbing 15!
B003X8597K|5.0|According to the notes in the booklet included with the opera,Hitler borrowed from the opera Heil Rienzi, and turned it into Heil Hitler.Also, the  idea of staging rituals and mass rituals came from this opera. The overture to Rienzi became the unoffical anthem of the Third Reich. I would have thought the staging would use Mussolini as its center piece.Thus, the opera is modern staging, set in the 1920's upwards. I could not see  the traditionalists would have any problems with the staging, unless they wanted the staging set in Rome in the 14th Century.I was wrong.This  early opera had its first performance in Dresden 1842. This night was the most sucessful of Wagner's life. More of this opera later.    Because of the ideas behind this staging of this opera, I will attempt to explain Wagner. He was a contradictory character. He wrote articles on vegetarianism, but ate meat and berated people who did not. He composed Parsival,which was about celebrate knights, some of whom are gradually seduced by flower maidens. When Wagner was asked about this he stated,\\" I would like to be a Saint but I am a artist. To compose I need to be as I am\\". His attitude towards Jews was not the best. His first article on Jews, was because he felt Meyerbeer should have done more to help him. But later on he did write more negative articles. He was forced to allow Levi to conduct the first performance of Parsival. Many Jews admired his work. He did feel they should be intergrated into the Fatherland, through his work. He was friendly with a number of people of this faith.  Unfortunately, for Wagner, Cosima,his wife was completely anti semitic. She became friendly with Houston Chamberlain, who believed that the future lay in Germany's hands. He also believed that Jesus was not a Jew but an Aryan.(?) He wrote the book 'Die Grundlagen' on this subject which even King  Wilhelm 11 read. A book that made this dangerous brew of nationalism and anti semiticism, palatable to the middle class, proudof Germany and hostile to Jews. This book was popular in Britain and France.In fact Houston was revered by the Nazi's. When he died in 1927 the Nazi's milked the death for all it was worth. He was seen as their Guru figure.Eventually, after many years of marriage,Houston married Eva,Richard and Cosimas daughter. Winifried married Siegfried, Richards son and she became an early follower of Hitler and probably his lover.The  rest is history. Hitler and his views, with the Nazi's, wiped out 6 million Jews.Wagner is seen as partly responsble for this.The reasoning is that his writings and music influenced Hitler.It is more complicated then that. If anyone did, it would be Houston Chamberlain.Hitler quoted great chunks from him in 'Mein Struggle' Thus, because of this situation characters in the Ring, such as Mime are seen as Jewish. While Wagner saw Mime as himself. A classic case is Klingsor and Kundry, from Parsifal, seen as basic Jewish characters. However,if you study Parsival carefully, you will find that it is based on Buddhism and symbols of Christianity.Act I, the 4th Squire states\\"she (kundry) is a heathen,a sorceress\\". Gurnemanz replies\\" Yes,she may be under a curse. She lives here now perhaps reincarnated to expiate some sin from an earlier life, not yet forgiven there. (Here Wagner is discussing Karma). Klingsor sings about who she had been through her many lives. Not very Jewish. Unfortunately, for Wagner, Hitler liked his Music.    Cosima was French, both Winifried and Houston Chamberlain were English and Hitler were Austrian. More German then the Germans. The only true German was the Saxon, Richard Wagner. Whereas when Richard died and she eventually took on the running of the Bayreuth theatre,she would change nothing. Her reasoning was, that this scenery is that the Master laid his eyes upon.She was a rigid person. Whereas, Richard said \\"Kinder create anew.\\" He also wanted new German operas to be played along side his in Bayreuth. He was unsure of his staging of the 1876. It has been recorded that he seemed disinterested. Wieland Wagner,once said that Richards works cannot be staged.Because in life he was changable, contradictory and vented his spleen through writing, he has had a bad press. Even Father Owen Lee, has written, you can like his music, thats fine, you do not have to like the man. The man and his music are interwined. I have explained in my review on the Valencia Ring, some of Wagners Philosophies, also,Tristan und Isolde with Stemme Singing. All on Bluray, what else.    Because this opera has used the rise and fall of Hitler to interpret Rienzi, it is best to understand a little about Wagner, which I have attempted to show. Now we get to the opera itself. For myself, I like it. You can see the beginnings of the future music coming through now and again. The Beginning of the work shows early 1920's and goes through to the Nazi period in Germany. I think this was a way for the director and designer, to bring Hitlers life before the audience. After all, the opera is live from the Deutsche oper Berlin.Act I has the crowds dressed like figures from Expressionistic painters Otto Dix and George Grosz.\\"The opera owes less to Meyerbeer and more to Spontini and Auber. Also styles ranging from Bellini, Weber to Beethoven Symphonies\\".(The Penquin opera guide.ed Holden Viking 1995) Conductor Lang-Lessing's tempi is fast. Brings to the fore the emotion and tension in the piece. Torsten Kerl, Kate Aldrich and Camilla Nylund are  sublime. A dream team to use a sporting term. The staging makes utter sense. The rubbish written by those who do not like this rendition of the opera in the DVDs is unbelievable. I mean why order it. You do not like modern staging, thats fine. I happen to like traditional and modern works.
1593272839|5.0|This book is a great way to be introduced to Haskell. Miran's writing style is conversational, and you can sense that he has a real passion about the language. His sketches that run throughout the book are whimsical and absurd, obliquely touching upon the subjects, and give something for the eyes to rest upon. There's even the occasional pop culture reference thrown in that let's you know that the book was written by a human (or at least a very hip robot). These sorts of things make programming books more engaging, and it's a welcome trend that I'm glad Miran follows - the seriousness often seen in technical and programming books makes many of them about as interesting as phone books, and almost as disposable. This book imparts programming concepts with substance and style, and as such makes it worth the sticker price. Haskell is a good language for dealing with discrete mathematics, but it doesn't have the same pizazz as something like JavaScript or Ruby, nor the simplicity of other languages. Miran is much like a wonderful peppercorn gravy poured over a dry meatloaf, making the technical aspects of Haskell fun.  Note - I was provided a copy for reviewing purposes by No Starch Press.

B003R0LBVW|1.0|This book did not live up to its hype. I found the characters to be whiny and annoying. While better than The Corrections, which isn't saying much, I will not be one to jump on the jonathon franzen bandwagon.
B0057AOOZ0|5.0|I've been a casual fan of her music since DC and to be honest, I've been iffy on her voice (no she can SANG, but just her vocals can be grating) until the '10 Grammy's when she belted out IWAB and a powerful, legendary cover of Alanis Morrisette's \\"You Oughta Know.\\" It was then that I truly realized and embraced her as a living legend. I'll call myself a \\"stan\\" at this point smh lol. However, she may be the last great female entertainer worth \\"stanning\\" for and I'll wear that badge with pride!       Being that I come from the school of the late Michael, Madonna, and Janet, it has been hard for these rookie performers to impress me. Beyonce is the only performer that is acting like a true professional on stage and she gets the utmost respect from me for that. Despite anticipating her latest effort, the album leaked and I heard mostly negative things about it. I didn't let that deter me from hearing the album for myself. I am telling you her subtle promo sucked me in completely. I had only heard two songs from this album, but I saw her \\"Year of 4\\" promo doc and she won me over AGAIN. This is a true professional who is taking charge of her career, but realizes that she is incredibly blessed with this life, but is still a small piece of the puzzle in this overwhelmingly huge  universe. Her career and personal life is inspiring to me and her album personifies that. This is a very mature, important record for her. People say it is an ode to Jay and that is fine, but to me it is for anyone who has ever LOVED and lost, period. The record is a little more hopeful than my other favorite album of the year, '21'. The message, the performance (vocals are PERFECTION on this one), musical influence, and the surprise sound (or disappointment) of this album to me makes this her best album to date for me. There is not one track that I do not appreciate. It is a cohesive album from start to finish. Even the quirky \\"Girls\\" grows on you even more and ends the album nicely. The production of Beyonce tracks are always on the quirky side and they will make you move your butt, but '4' will finally make you sing like you are Whitney. But this is Beyonce, OKAY!?! YASS HONEY! If you respect or quietly appreciate KING BEY as a singer, artist, performer, etc. then you have to give this album a fair listen. It is NOT like her other albums, but it is her best imo. This album will inspire you to live your life to the fullest and love hard. I dunno about you, but that's the type of music I like to listen to! \\"I was here. I lived, I loved... I've done everything that I wanted and it was more than I thought it would be.\\" CHILLS MAN. CHILLS.     I've read where Beyonce wanted to make an album that she could sing when she was 40. Umm no shade, but there are some singers who will be trying to ~seriously~ singing about disco sticks and highway unicorns well into their 30's. C'mon son. Basically this album is an instant classic and something to be proud of. I think it will be between 21 & 4 for album of the year @Grammy's. I wouldn't care who won; both are classic albums from two very talented woman. But back to King Bey, cop this album!!!       Favorite, standout tracks: 1+1, I Care, Rather Die Young, START OVER (replay value is srs on this one), Countdown, I was Here.

B004EPYZUI|2.0|Okay, let me explain myself just a tad.  I really enjoyed this film, but I'm totally aware that it's not really a good movie.  I am of the opinion that a film can be good or bad as a FACT, but it's only YOUR opinion if YOU don't like it.  Get it?  Citizen Kane is a masterpiece, perfectly made film, but you may hate it.  That doesn't change the fact that it's a great film.  YOu just didn't get it or it just wasn't your cup of tea.  There is a criteria from which to judge films, varying for each genre and the specific film's intentions.  I would go into more details but it would take up the majority of this review. Some films are great or good whether you like them or not.  Battlefield: Los Angeles is not an inspired or even good movie, it's a fact, but for whatever reason you may like it or think it's one of your favorites.  Making any sense?  There's a reason why professional film critics are film critics.  They have standards, they have experience and a vast knowledge of almost every type of film to use as templates for anything they're hating or loving on.  Anyway.....<br /><br />I've only watched the unrated director's cut on blu ray all the way through.  I only skimmed the theatrical version<br /><br />Okay, now on to Sucker Punch Zack Snyder's(Watchmen, Dawn of the Dead 04, 300) new epic fantasy film released last year to horrible reviews and even worse box office.  This film is the most upsetting of movies that don't work.  It actually has ideas and themes.  It just doesn't really get them through in a great way.  I've always said I'd rather see an epic failure by someone who is trying to say something or who is a REAL artist over some hackeneyed piece of corporate drivel(**cough, cough***Transformers III**cough, cough) without a soul or goal beyond the weekend's opening box office.  Sukcer Punch is a lot of things but it is definitely not a film made by committe with great corporate interests at hand.  It's way too much of a downer, loaded with as much physical violence as it is with mental violence.  And YES, I 'got' it.  It's not very oscure to get as some of the film's overzealous, and possibly in denial, champions would accuse this film's detractors of being.  There's no real twist to the story.  Right from the first five or ten minutes you know where you stand as a doctor hovers over our main character, Babydoll, with a needle ready to lobotomize her.  The movie never hides what's not real and what is.  There's no twist.  It states its case right off the bat.  That's also a problem of sorts.  The film goes into Babydoll's mind right before the puncture and it takes us to a brothel set in some fantasy world.  She is a new dancer set to be de-virginized by a 'high roller' in five days.  Of course she wants to escape before this but needs some help by some of the other likeminded girls around her.  Alas, her great gift is a magical burlesque dance, that we never see or experince, that distracts her captor long enough for her cohorts to get items they will need to make their escape.  Every time she goes to dance we go into a fantasy world within the fantasy world we're already in.  Get it?<br /><br />Here's the thing: every fantasy world within the fantasy are made up of pop culture scenarios influenced by everything from steampunk, war epics, Lord of the Rings, and anime.  We never see what her cohorts are doing to get the escape items in fantasy world number one, we just see action scenarios in fantasty world number two that sort of emulates the emotions and actions going on in fantasy world number one.  Yeah, I'm getting a headache, and no, this is not Naked Lunch or Inception, not even The Matrix.  While the action scenes are beautifully rendered and fairly exciting, at first, they all seem tedious and moot compared to what the ACTUAL plot is.  It's real visceral entertainment, and while I applaud it for that, I can't get over the fact that so much time is spent on action scenarios that have no narrative thrust, purpose or even flow when we are told they are all just fantasies to begin with.  And that's not counting the fact that the dramatic situation pre-labotomy fantasy is also TOTALLY made up and pointless at the end of the day.  I get what Snyder is going for and I appreciate his risk but he fails more than he succeeds.  To make matters worse by the third fantasy scenario you are bored and start to have the tedium of the whole thing sink in.  You don't care about the girls slaying a dragon or slo-mo fighting cyborgs delivering a bomb on a train.  You just don't because you've already been told that they don't really mean anything, and the whole time you're just wondering why so much time is spent in this fantasty number two relm.  This is the film's biggest problem.  While you may want to try and turn off your brain to this, you simply can't.  Sure, some audience memebers are simple and just like the explosions and effects, so they don't care, but these types of people aren't real movie lovers or fans.  They're just veg-heads who dig anything that's in the moment qualifying as 'KEWL' to them.  So, as a real movie buff and lover, who cares what they think anyway?  Just skim through all the over-praising reviews and you'll see what I mean.  They all talk about action, half naked chicks and special effects.  Not really something a real movie geek spends too much time talking about unless it's truly amazing and integral to the story, ala Jurassic Park, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Matrix, Inception, and many others.<br /><br />I say all this because I want to let you know that I may be over rating this film by a star and half due to my love of it's concept, tone and over the top visuals.  I love looking at this film.  I liked the whole concept while not really digging the execution.  This is NOT  a good film, but it's one I enjoyed and will watch over again for sure.  Zach Snyder is a Ridley Scott level visualist of the highest order.  His frames would make great stills.  He does things with visuals that hacks like Paul WS Anderson and Michael Bay wish they could do in their dreams.  Also, while his action set pieces are just as silly and over the top as a Bay or Anderson film, he knows how to compose interlocking shots and edits his films very well.  The action flows naturally and works for the most part.  ALthough, he should NEVER do slo-motion EVER AGAIN.  Actually, all directors should drop this as a tool of theirs when doing action with big effects.  Its become a parody of itself, and unless the director is trying to illicit laughter or groans through slo mo, I think it's beyond time to put it to bed for a while.  I was sick of it by the third Matrix sequel honestly.  Snyder has been quoted as saying that his upcoming Superman reboot(or whatever Hollywood calls movies that retread old ideas these days) will be lite to totally void of slo mo shots.  Thank god.  I admire and like this film to a degree.  I like what it was going for and the visuals are striking.  The first few action beats are truly fun but lose steam toward the third act.  You'll either love it or hate it, but it will never be a truly great or good film.<br /><br />I can't really talk much about the acting or the characters due to most of them not even being real people, but rather figments and pesonality traits of one girl wrapped up in a fantasy.  All the female actress look good and perform well enough, but there's not much to play outside of action posing.  Emily Browning, who plays the lead in all three realities, is very striking and has much charisma on screen.  She has got an exotic beauty that doesn't resemble any young actors of this era or the past.  I would like to see if she has the chops with a meatier role.  I will say that the soundtrack is awesome and integral to how the film works.  The score is interwoven with songs by Bjork and Brian Ferry among others to create a vibe that is totally unique.  I have the soundtrack and I'm a huge fan of the cabaret-esque version of Love is the Drug co-performed by the always stunning Carla Gugino.  It's a real show stopper, more so than some of the later action scenes.<br /><br />The blu ray looks and sounds great of course.  The special features are limited but they do include two features that make it worth it, the director's R rated cut and the Maximum Movie Mode that goes along with it on disc two.  The disc says that the R rated version is 17 minutes longer than the theatrical version, but I only skimmed the theatrical and only noticed two differences.  Firstly, the violence, while not more gratuitous, is more graphic(especially when some hero characters bite it towards the end), and some of the CGI laden action sequences have been added to in minute areas.  The biggest addition is at the ending with actor John Hamm(Tv's Mad Men) which was surprising to me, because in the theatrical version he seems to only show up for face time.  In the director's cut he plays a sort of salvation embodiment that lets the Babydoll character know that she can be free in an extended bedroom sequence in fantasy world number two.  It's a sweet and poignent scene but it's totally weird at the same time.  Why this was cut out of the theatrical version, especially with a name actor like John Hamm in the role, is beyond me.  Next up is the usually enteraining Maximum Movie Mode which Warner Home Video usually includes for its bigger blu ray titles.  It's basically the a behind the scenes doc that you watch simultaneously with the film.  Zach Snyder hosts, as he did for his director's cut of his much better movie Watchmen.  It covers everything from special effects, costumes, casting and set design.  Snyder also gives details regarding where the idea and the process of the scriptwriting came from, which may be interesting to fans and detractors alike.  Sometimes the info is played during the movie and sometimes the movie is stopped for docs and commentary.  I love this feature and I enjoyed watching this one for Sucker Punch.  The first disc of the blu ray has the theatrical version on it along with two other special features, both fairly useless.  First we get animated shorts that play as prequels or rather backstories for the fantasy heavy second realities.  They're not really animated but more on par with South Park style animation done by computers and very cut and paste.  They're pretty lame, and really only give vague backstories to what is behind some of the villains in the big action fantasy sequences.  Not really worth watching.  The most lame feature is the second one on this disc regarding the film's soundtrack and it's creation.  It's barely five minutes long and adds up to little more than a commercial for the soundtrack album. This a bummer considering how much work and thought went into the soundtrack from the composers to the pop songs chosen, most of which were sung by actress Emily Browning.  It's short and pointless.  For more in depth info regarding the soundtrack you're better off going to the Maximum Movie Mode feature on disc two.<br /><br />So, there you have it.  I'm totally over rating this film, but also under rating it considering that I did kind of like what it was and what it wasn't.  It's worth a peek as a rental.  Like I said you will either hate or love it.<br /><br />PS: Oh, yeah, Scott Glenn is in this movie too!  He's a really good actor that is totally WASTED in this film.  He shows up in each fantasy vignette as a Yoda-like character who guides our heroines and gives cliche'd lines(I think they're cliche'd on purpose though).  Nice to see him work, but I would have liked to see him more in this film....or any film.e Paul WS Anderson and Michael Bay wish they could do in their dreams.

B0017I1FO4|5.0|A great present for my dad's birthday, amazing price, and arrived so quickly!! Much better than going to the store and dealing with crowds!  :)
B001BEK8E2|5.0|Rashomon is one of the relatively few movies that truly deserves the name \\"classic.\\" There are so many reasons why Rashomon is worth watching and so much has already been said about the movie, but here's my take. I watched it recently with my wife and my 16 and 15 year old kids, and I could tell that although it wasn't one my kids would have chosen, they understood that they were in the presence of something greater than the typical movie they've seen.<br /><br />So why should you watch Rashomon?<br /><br />1. It's a groundbreaking film. Many of Kurosawa's techniques were cutting edge at the time Rashomon was filmed. While this is one of the main reasons film critics give for rating movies highly, in my opinion it's not enough of a reason to call a movie great.<br /><br />2. Great acting. Many moviegoers wouldn't recognize this as great acting because the culture and moviemaking are so different from what they're used to. The greatness of the acting is best seen in how each actor or actress has to adapt to fit the 4 versions of the same story. But even great acting isn't enough to make a great film for me.<br /><br />3. Multiple perspectives and richness of meaning. We live in an age when we've come to expect that every story has multiple angles and no one right answer. I'd like to officially blame Rashomon for that. While the use of multiple perspectives has now become a common part of the grammar of cinema, with Rashomon it was revolutionary. The 4 different versions of the story not only create a deep layering effect on the question of what really happened but also create a sort of 3-D effect in terms of gaining some understanding of human nature. While Kurosawa's actors wanted to know which was the \\"real\\" story, the big K told them that no single one was correct. Even though, personally, this irks me just a little, the truth is that the movie reveals a lot about human nature.<br /><br />4. The movie reveals a lot about human nature. Now here's perhaps the best reason for calling a movie great. This is also why great movies like Rashomon transcend time and culture. I'm a 21st century Christian in America watching a Japanese movie from 1950 set in an unspecified time. And while the multiple perspectives preclude knowing exactly what happened, Kurosawa still manages to communicate truth. I can't reduce the message of the movie to a moral, but suffice it to say that Rashomon leaves you with a strong sense of the evil of humanity but also with the possibility of redemption.<br /><br />5. Great storytelling. What I noticed first about watching Rashomon with my kids was that the story sucked them in, and it did it without the following: rapid scene changes, a blaring soundtrack, lots of sound effects, rapid action, color film, noise that fills every crevice of the film's aural canvass, and a director who tells you exactly what to think and what he tells you to think is the same shallow, safe moralism - or anti-moralism and anti-heroism - that most movies offer. No, at the center of this story was a question: \\"What happened?\\" But the way the story was told and developed engrossed all of us.<br /><br />I wish some grand experiment could be conducted on teenagers (and adults!) today and have millions of them all sit down and watch Rashomon. I'd like to see if perhaps, in spite of the usual pablum they serve themselves, they wouldn't catch a glimpse of a deeper world that is worth thinking about and worth thinking about long after the trance induced by the movie had worn off.s is also why great movies like Rashomon transcend time and culture.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Travis is a firecracker, and Abby just happens to be his match in this mouthwatering and intense romance. The cast of characters is full of extraordinary roles that will captivate readers from the first page. When thrown together this novel steps up to amazing creating an explosive and brutal story that will grab you by the throat for the duration. Beautiful Disaster is by far at the top of my favorites list, and a fabulous read. The action packed and intensity of this novel is almost palpable that will give readers a tangible experience to carry long after the last page.<br /><br />I look at this book much like I look at Travis' character; rough around the edges but beautiful through and through. McGuire created this novel based with hope in a world that is not black and white. Simply saying people are complicated with baggage and history that will plague them through existence. What McGuire offers in this amazing story is the hope that obstacles can and will be overcome with love. Travis character is everything that Abby is trying to leave behind, but just like always never judge a book by its cover. Abby soon finds that Travis just might be everything that she needs with just enough good and bad.<br /><br />It just might be possible that this book should come with a warning label. Readers be prepared to be absorbed for the duration of this novel nothing else will get accomplished until you are done with this book. I promise! Officially BookWhisperer would recommend this as a MUST READ. Also this will be a new addition to my favorites list shortly.

1439107955|5.0|Chocked full of information.  Written so well you forget you're reading non fiction!  We've come a long way and have further to go.  Facinating read.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|This is truly one of those new classics form the '80s. The movie moves well and is best seen unedited. Love the scene with the tree!
B004G6009K|4.0|I was going to buy this movie, but when I noticed that Comcast was renting it through xfinity I decided to that instead and save some $15.    It was a cute movie with a good storyline and avery nice 3D environment. The movie is not as impacting visually as OWLS, but manages to do a good job. Disney movies tend to be very colorful and this one will not disappoint in that respect. This movie tends to be one of the highest rated 3D movies, I think that has to be on how well the movie incorporates the 3D effects without being overwhelming. I personally like and look for movies that have heavy 3D effects, but as we all know those are hard to find, this movie has about 2-4 big pop up effects, but the entire movie plays a very well defined 3D environment.    I would consider buying this movie in the future, but maybe after I ran out of tittles to try out. I think it's a good movie to show off your 3D HDTV.      I will be looking forward for more Disney 3D movies.

0307386171|4.0|Philip Larkin wrote that \\"sexual intercourse began in 1963\\".  This novel is set in 1962 and it describes the day on which Edward and Florence, both 22, were married and left for their first night together at a hotel on Chesil Beach in Dorset.  Both were virgins and, though they were very much in love with each other, they were both apprehensive about the consummation of their marriage - Edward because, though longing for his first experience, he was afraid he might not be able to perform properly, and Florence because she found the whole business utterly repugnant, though she was convinced that there was something wrong with her, that it was her duty to go through with it, and that she wanted to please the man she loved.  Neither of them had ever spoken about sex during their courtship, and whenever, during that time, he had tried to go beyond a certain point, she had shied away and been cool towards him for a while.<br /><br />At the end of the first chapter they are about to go to bed; at which point McEwen interposes a chapter telling us about Edward's and Florence's earlier life and their very different social and cultural backgrounds.  This is interesting in itself and touches on many aspects of the Britain of the 1950s. It explains why both of them had freed themselves from the confines of their homes; but we will not find in their experiences of home any clues to why their lives at university should have been spent mainly with members of their own sex or why their wedding night would be problematic.<br /><br />And then, back in the bedroom, the tragi-comedy of their inexperience resumes.  And once again, as we want to know what happens next, there is a prolonged flashback - which again, though vivid and interesting, is quite disconnected from what has just happened.<br /><br />Finally we return to the present, and an emotional situation which, for both of them, was utterly and fatally different from that of only an hour or two earlier.<br /><br />The writing is beautiful; the book is consistently interesting; the period flavour is well evoked.  The perception of Edward's and Florence's psychology is acute.  But though there are some elements in their past which relate to what happened on their wedding night, a great many of them do not and, in my view, this detracts somewhat from the cohesiveness of the whole.istently interesting; the period flavour is well evoked.

B0055FR5PS|2.0|they have movies with 3D and non 3D theatres.  They should have movies with excessive camera shaking and normal camera movement theatres.  I sat and sat watching and oh man it was good with the action and special effects, but wow, i went to bed that night with sore eyeballs.  The camera shook so much it was ridiculous.  Even before the action started two men talking at a desk looked like drunk camera.  I dont mind hand held cameras like those used in the tv show 24.  It was just terrible in this movie.  Aaron Eckhart did a good job, but too bad the director or director of photography ruined the final product.
0688014291|4.0|With three employees, it can be hard to keep everyone motivated, working hard and knowing what to do. This very short, simple read gives you three pieces of advice. The goal is to let your employees know that you're happy to guide them, but that you want them to eventually learn to make good decisions on their own.<br /><br />You achieve this by:<br />1. developing short, written goals for each employee that they can read and reread in less than a minute.<br />2. explaining to them that you're going to be very blunt and clear in your negative and positive feedback.<br />3. giving them negative and positive feedback as often as is necessary, in a structured way, so that everyone feels fair about it.<br /><br />The only thing I really hate about this book is that it encourages you to touch your employees on the arm or shoulder after giving positive or negative feedback. I'm sorry, but I hate being touched by people I'm not close with. I'd find that horribly invasive and inappropriate, were I an employee, and if someone gave me negative feedback and then touched me, I'd be very creeped out. I understand that other people may not be this way, but I'd use caution in following that part of the book, as people's reactions to being touched vary wildly.<br /><br />Other than that small complaint, I found this book full of very important, clear advice. It's important for employees to always know where they stand and to feel empowered to make independent decisions, and I appreciated the guidance on how to implement that in my small landscaping business.
B004N66XYE|1.0|Right after I spent most of a week watching all the DVD's of the original \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" I proceeded to watch this new (continuing?) version.  I'm very happy that I had the chance to immediately compare the two.    I'm sorry I spent the money and wasted my time on this set.  The original Up/Down was terrific.  This one is a DUD.  The characters aren't well developed nor are they nearly as endearing as the original cast.  The Downstairs servants (with the exception of Rose) for the most part are immoral and vulgar and very easy to dislike (exception are Rachel and the man from India).    My recommendation is not to purchase this one.

1400032717|5.0|The writing of this book delicately handles the innocence of not only a child, but a child with autistic/Asperger-syndrome like effects - Christopher John Francis Boone, a 15-year-old boy who describes himself as `a mathematician with some behavioral difficulties' living in Swindon, Wiltshire<br /><br />This is not the edgy Asperger-like persona of [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'s Lisbeth Salander.  This is a person who should be tucked away with Milne's \\"Winnie the Pooh\\" series, while laying on his bed, drinking milk shakes while watching G-rated films on his 12\\" black-and-white simple television.<br /><br />People who have been around others with these issues can only improve their understanding of how the afflicted perceive the rest of us.  The use of perverse language by adults in response to the totally innocent responses of the protagonist's and narrator's answers to their questions can only lead you to roll your eyes as the impatience and inattentive weaknesses of our characters are the callous result of living in urban environment.<br /><br />Even the poor innocent can created almost nuclear damage to those around him.  His parent's relationship is affected, the neighbor's relationship is affected, the neighbor's dog is affected, the other neighbor is slightly affected, and the police - which seem to have no ability to grasp who or what he is - arrest the innocent for all of the wrong reasons.<br /><br />In the end, the people closest to him are perhaps cruelest, but not by design but by being too careful and trying too hard not to hurt him.  They fail.  And, his mind does not easily forgive failure, especially from those to whom he must rely.<br /><br />Basically, life with or as someone with Asperger syndrome is extremely frustrating.  So frustrating, that people will do things they regret and seemingly become more animalistic, more ugly, and even more inhumane to those which need the most humane and compassionate surroundings.<br /><br />I was enlightened by this book.  It was so seamless and brilliant that it makes the complex subject matter seem easy to comprehend.seamless and brilliant that it makes the complex subject matter seem easy to comprehend.
B003VIW8DK|5.0|If you have ever considered yourself a Bryan Ferry fan, do not hesitate, buy this album it is amazing.  Everyone I play \\"Olympia\\" for becomes a new or returning affectionado of the smooth, almost jazzy stylings of this musical imprescario. And the voice....is even better than before. \\"Mamona,\\" was his last good album...and I never bought \\"Taxi,\\" (Amazing Grace????....SHUT UP!!!!). I happened upon this new album by accident and with some hesitation gave it listen, and I was delighted. At nearly 70 years of age...we should all be so lucky...Mr. Ferry has given us a musical gift.  Do not hesitate!!!!  Buy this album!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The second book felt a bit like \\"filler\\" material but still kept me interested.  Great trilogy.
030745455X|4.0|I thought it was a great sequel to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Though that it had lots of twits and turns and to find out the end, was a jaw dropper. I cant wait to start to read the 3rd and possibly the last book in the series. (Yes i know Larsson is dead) but i also know that they have unfinished worked of a 4, 5th and outlines for a 6th book. Lets hope they will see the light someday.
B004A8ZX2I|4.0|I just watched \\"Unknown\\" and I didn't have very high expectations after reading some of these reviews. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it though! It may have \\"borrowed\\" from a few other movies, but I can honestly say it was one of the better movies I've seen this year and I would recomend it!
B004USRKX8|3.0|My 3* rating is an averaging of the musical quality(at least 4*s, David Crosby's best solo work hands down) and the shoddy packaging of the (theoretically) 2011 reissue. There is not a sliver of information indicating it was rereleased in 2011,  only the barebones reprint of the original LP artwork, no remastering information, no HDCD encoding, nothing to indicate the slightest care was taken to upgrade this edition if indeed any was. The mix is definitely \\"hotter\\" than my vinyl record-whether it's to your liking is somewhat a personal preference but it's different.  I would hold out replacing any earlier edition until someone can get a straight answer from Rhino who by and when the mastering was done. Will update if I get any response from them.
0307887960|3.0|This diet is simple, but very hard to stick to. I started out with grande plans and did well the first week. After that, I went on vacation and was unable to live on just protein. It is too unatural, as I love the cold crispy summer fruits and veggies.
0061726826|5.0|I found this book to be a wonderful read that I couldn't put down. Lauren Oliver combines an easy read for young adults mixed with an indepth complex plot that is like no other. The book kept me intersted and I felt a mix of several emotions including excitement, intrigument, curiosity, and sadness.
B00506NRBS|1.0|I have read a number of books put out recently by the Domino Project.  For the most part, I have been impressed.  This one, well it really fell short of the mark.  It does give a personal account of doing what you love instead of picking something to get rich.  However, it didn't offer anything new or educational.  Poke the Box and Think and Grow Rich were better at making the same points. It didn't hold my attention even though it was short.  It rambled.  Time is valuable, if I am reading a business or other self-improvement book; I want to get value from it.  This book did not provide value for me.
0393338827|2.0|i was looking to be informed about the short of 2008.  this book was extremely detailed and for someone not having a huge business background i was a little lost.  book had so much information in it.  never finished reading it
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I saw this when it first came out.  have a copy on vhs.  bought this dvd to see what has been done for new age clarity.   Wonders - fabulouse.  only problem I found - this 4 disk set has different versions and I   watched the wrong one LOL,,  hated that it didnt have the happy  ending.  next time.  An excellent movie - even if it is labled SciFi LOL.  recomend to all.
B0026JWDQW|5.0|I learned Paolo Nutini just recently watching the Graham Norton's previous shows from Comcast. I fell in-love with his artistry. What a gift he has. I have no words but indeed, a 5 star rate and an absolute \\"10\\"! I highly recommend including this album in your collection. His pure genius! Love listening to his music!
B00003CX9W|5.0|I remember this as a kid.  awed by it then and loved it even   now.  hope the grandkids will also enjoy it.  It is as good if not better than a lot of the more recent   animated's.  simply amazing for its time and completely  enjoyable.
0060012358|4.0|It's a clashing of good and evil in the guise of human nature.  It describes acts of extreme bravery and acts of greed.  The problems in one group of beings at war with another group of beings are shown from a different angle.  It's an easy read with a bit of tension in it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I personally like Adele's voice with the more upbeat songs she sings, however, having said that, she can sing anything.  This album is a total joy with every song having something to recommend it.  There is emotion, understanding and true love of music that comes through with each song.  I have my favorites, of course, but the album as a whole is worthy of listening to and learning each and every song.  Normally I decline purchasing whole albums simply because there are usually 2-3, maybe 4 songs that I really like and the rest is a waste.  With Adele, there is no waste.  It's all musically beautiful.
B0038BBA4I|4.0|I hadn't heard a lot of this band before buying the product and was worried that even though I liked the music the lyrics would have stuff in them I couldn't conscience listening to (this happens to me frequently).  I've looked at the lyrics since then and judged them to be fairly ambiguous, and I ended up listening to this music a lot.
0393061310|4.0|I bought this book based on all the popularity and good word of mouth it had.  I really thought I would be disappointed as initially the writing comes off as simplistic and slow.  Boy was I wrong!  The magic of this book is just that, it makes everything seem so simple and straightforward that, at the end of each chapter, you just cannot believe you did not realize all these natural facts by yourself.  The knowledge you gain (effortlessly) is enormous.  Racist notions are laid to rest and the different levels of technological knowledge across civilizations are naturally and logically explained.    This is a book I would love my children (if I had them) to read.  It should be read in classrooms across the world, to be analyzed and discussed by young minds eager to learn.      Jared Diamond wrote a gem of a book.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|I absolutly loved this movie ! It was a good love story and I think it has a point its whats on the inside thats good looking not what u look like on the outside only ![[ASIN:B002ZG975Q Beastly]]
B000W796OM|4.0|In my review of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets I talked about about how I really didn't enjoy the book, but enjoyed the movie.  Well, it's the exact opposite for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.<br /><br />Azkaban definitely starts to delve into the darker aspects of the Harry Potter stories with the arrival of the Dementors, the escape of a convicted murderer and the emergence of a key player in the murders of Lily and James Potter.  But, before the darkness takes its place, this book begins with my absolute favorite of the Dursley scenes: the inflation of Aunt Marge.  Seriously, both the book was spot on with this scene and I really was disappointed in how glossed over it was in the movie.<br /><br />I think my dislike of the movie stems from the over-saturated advertising that was done before the movie was released.  I could not see a movie, watch TV, turn on my computer without seeing Sirius Black's face crying out in agony on the newspaper.  I was tired of the movie before I even saw it (and that's saying something).  So while I love the addition of Emma Thompson as Prof. Trelawney, love seeing Hermione deck Malfoy and thoroughly enjoy seeing the book of monsters come to life, anything having to do with Sirius Black was a major turn-off for me.<br /><br />Before I finish this review, I want to talk a little bit about the imaginative brilliance that is the Maurader's Map.  Just when I'm finally recovering from how amazing the game of Quidditch is, Rowling introduces a piece of paper that any kid would love to get their hands on.  I mean.. it's an interactive treasure map, for all intents and purposes!  So brilliant.<br /><br />I enjoyed re-reading Azkaban and found myself rolling my eyes a bit at re-watching it.  I prefer the ending to the book, prefer the timeline of the gifted Firebolt, prefer many things in the book over the movie's version of the events... but when it comes down to it, they are both still quintessential Harry Potter and it's impossible to forget them.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I have an Ematic Eglide - this app works great until I have to recharge the battery, the app says I have to go to archives and re-upload the books..it only worked 1 time, I unstalled the app and  then reinstalled only to have it tell me I have the app on too many devices and to remove some of the devices.  I did that and the app still doesn't work.  I have switched to the Kobo Book app and it works perfectly even after I recharge the battery.  It's a shame because I love Amazon and have always bought my books from your website..
B003AO1SVS|2.0|I have been an avid Black Keys fan.  I first heard of the them in 2006 when I heard songs Magic Potion playing in the background at a record store and I had to buy that album. I have gone backwards and forwards from that time to accumulate their albums.  Now, credentials aside, I am not a fan of this album. I honestly, wanted to give it one star but there is one good song on the whole album: \\"Howlin' for you\\" .  I really liked Magic Potion, Rubber Factory, and Thickfreakness because of the raw sound that seems simplistic until you listen deeper to the actual playing of Dan and Patrick. I thought that Attack and Release had its moments, but this album is a complete exit from what attracted me to Black Keys.  The music from the first four albums was pure extension of Dan and Patrick that seemed to channel Jimi Hendrix, the Stones, Led Zeppelin, and The Who. It was two guys making unadulterated rock music. As for Brothers, I have to describe this as a hipster band trying too hard on their first album to sound unique and/or ironic. Seriously, keyboards came into rock in the mid-seventies and died in the eighties. Why any recent band would feel the need to revisit their synthesized sound is beyond me.  Part of me hopes that this a cruel, inside joke by the band, just to see what would pass for rock music with rock critic acclaim.
B000BYA4JM|1.0|Me no like this movie.  Me like all actors in movie but one, Madonna.  Madonna make me sick and me feel bloated and me not even sure if she is actor.  When me take garbage to curb, me often think that the stink of garbage is like Madonna must smell like.  She look dirty and in need of hosing off muck and scum from her gross body.  Maybe someday she stink less.  Me sure hope so.
B003UESJHE|5.0|I've loved Colin Firth ever since I saw him in the BBC version of Pride & Prejudice. He and Geoffrey Rush are amazing in this film. I don't often buy films, but this is one I want to keep in my DVD library to watch again. It is inspiring to watch a Royal humble himself and receive help from someone not in the Royal family and put the needs of his nation to the forefront, despite his own fears and handicap. I knew nothing about this king until I saw this.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|My son has been reading these books cover to cover for a few years now. He is actually excited to get these books as a Christmas present, so of course we've kept up with the movies. The first movie was really cute and it followed the book pretty good, but I have to say that Rodrick Rules was hilarious. My 8 yr old, 11 yr old, and myself were all incredibly entertained. I'm not much on stupid comeday, but this is a keeper!
B00028HBKC|5.0|What can I say:  it's an exceptional movie showing us Christ's sufferings for our sins.  Although, Mel Gibson used a lot of restraint; Jesus was beaten worse than than.  What an incredible God we serve !
B00005JKN9|2.0|The only thing entertaining was the  costumes of the Irish.  Which were those plaid colors and big top hats.    Decaprio Father was a terrible role model. You have to pity any person raising up his child on gang fights.  I can't believe it was that hard to survive getting off the boat. New York was probably the worst place to settle???? And all those brothels in NY.  The big surprise is finding out Daniel Day Lewis is the main star... a blood thirsty crook!
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I bought this book on my Kindle after reading a few reviews and the story line but have to say I was fairly disappointed overall, it is on the bestseller list but that is just a numbers game, I usually like my thrillers and mysteries to be very well written and dark, this one can be termed a wannabe mystery. I saw through the summary and \\"catches\\" quite early on and that is never good for one reading a mystery ; -) Read the Elizabeth George series if you like a well written and detailed mystery novel.
B003EYVXSW|5.0|Splice was a great movie. Great visual effects. Good acting and plot.Anyone who likes scifi movies would like this.It was well worth the money.It's a keeper for my collection.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|Loved the writing style but the build up to the end was a let down. Well written book that brings out a relationship between sisters exceedingly poignantly. You feel Bee's sadness and frustration well and you can \\"see\\" Tess through the writing...... Good quick read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I totally agree with the other reviews. I got this game on the iPhone and it is a solid puzzle game that will keep you entertained for ages. It starts out simple and gets progressively harder and harder. But often there is more than 1 solution to the problem. To keep you going when you finished it you can try beating the number of moves it takes for each puzzle. It is a great thinking person's game!
B004XIQIPQ|3.0|This is easy. \\"Suck It and See\\" is not \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\\" (catchy, upbeat, comedic, glorified pub rock). Nor is it \\"Favourite Worse Nightmare\\" (punk infused, guitar ridden, fresh, laden with songs that seemeto be barely thrown together but slick enough to sound tight). If it means anything, I personally favour \\"Whatever\\".    The funky beats, catchy guitar riffs and general swagger from these earlier efforts seem to have been diluted for some unknown reason. Kinda reminds me of the old saying, \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\\". Where's the mojo, guys? Look,it's still Arctic Monkeys, but not classic Arctic Monkeys. And it is waaaay better than Andre Rieu, for sure. I just hope they go back into the studio and get it on with whatever the formula that was used to make \\"Whatever\\"and \\"Nightmare\\" so repeatable on the iPod. Maybe it will take a few more spins (\\"Whatever It Sounds Like At First, It Sounds A Lot Better Later\\"), or better, maybe I need to test it out really loud on the JBL home theater (I may seem confident, but I'm not, really).
0142501123|1.0|We loved this book when we checked it out from the library. Unfortunately, in the copy we ordered, two of the best verses were changed.  Fortunately there were some other reviews talking about this problem, so I knew to check. What a disappointment--the \\"witch with french fries sounds delicious to me!\\" and \\"I think just this once I'll have witch without fries\\" lines are some of my son's favorites. In the changed version they are replaced with bland alternatives, and one verse doesn't even scan anymore. Many thanks to the reviewers who alerted me, or I would have had a very confused and sad little birthday boy.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|This book seemed to be a mystery/thriller version of '50 First Dates.'  While I found this novel interesting, I found it predictable and could not get myself over the idea that I had read/watched this entire plot before.  That being said, I have over 20 partially read books on my Kindle, but I finished this one within a couple of days.  It is a good read & definitely worth your time, but I do not feel it is anything remarkable.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|Appropriately, on Gregg Allman's first solo outing in over a decade, he's chosen to record a CD that's essentially a blues \\"tribute\\" album. To his credit, Allman sounds absolutely miserable here which, if you're recording blues, is most beneficial. (He's not the picture of contentment on the cover either.) Outside of one original, the rest of the material is largely an intriguing mix of largely country and Chicago blues material.<br /><br />Produced by T Bone Burnett, and sporting an all-star studio cast (including Mac Rebennack), \\"haunting\\" might be the best way describe the mood here, as many songs are arranged in minor keys. In fact, you can't get much more haunting than the opener, \\"Floating Bridge,\\" Sleepy John Estes' true tale of falling into a ragging river and being saved from drowning by clinging to a floating bridge. The loss of love and the process of losing it are a constant theme throughout as songs like \\"Little by Little, \\"Devil Got My Woman,\\" \\"Checkin' on My Baby\\" and \\"Blind Man\\" exemplify. Interestingly, \\"Blind Man\\" is actually a cover of a cover. Originally recorded by Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland, the version here mirrors the arrangement of Little Milton's later hit version.<br /><br />Allman takes a more macho turn though on the likes of Muddy's \\"Can't Be Satisfied\\" and Magic Sam's \\"My Love Is Your Love.\\" The last few years, Sam's songs have frequently been turning up on new blues CDs and Allman gets on the bandstand too with what might well be the highlight of this disc. Allman also does a very creditable job of B.B. King's \\"Please Accept My Love,\\" which listeners on the Gulf Coast will immediately recognize as a swamp pop ballad. Low Country Blues is the real thing and a wonderful listen from beginning to end.--Jeff Hannusch, OffBeat Magazine, March 2011 issue, [...]
B001POX73C|5.0|Entertaining.  A bit confusing in the beginning introducing characters and the plot.  I'm not a simpleton, but I do like to breeze through the reading.  I read for fun, not education - so this was a fun read.  I really dislike reviews that tell you the whole plot - why bother reading the book  if the review will give it away.  But this was entertaining.
B004HGBUVG|3.0|As heard here, Lucinda Williams' voice seems to be losing shape, a battered piano, muddled at some places, strangely fitting at others, wearing out in its own unique way. Matched with pedal-steel guitars as on \\"Copenhagen,\\" the voice bleeds like watercolor, threatening to lose form and wear out the paper. At such points, the words matter more than ever. On this release, we get mixed signals.<br /><br />Williams has always favored parallel structures. On several of these tracks (the noir blues \\"To Be Loved\\"), they refuse to pay off, though the title track conjures up her great songwriter's spirit--direct, nostalgic, Whitmanesque. Elvis Costello offers up some fierce guitar on \\"Seeing Black,\\" and with Don Was at the helm, the album maintains the proper contour and shimmer.<br /><br />\\"Soldiers Song\\" is a stark, line-by-line contrast between life on the battlefield and life back home. War is brutish, but such simple treatment feels like short shrift for the subject and the singer. Then again, \\"Ugly Truth\\" catches that wee-hours conversation when it really doesn't matter what the person does, you simply want them to do something, cursed though you both are.<br /><br />At a few points on Blessed, you want Williams to dig the knife in further and push herself past foreboding hints. Then, she closes things with \\"Kiss Like Your Kiss,\\" a waltz that sums up years of work and reminds that the night has many turns left.--Brian Boyles, OffBeat Magazine, March 2011 issue. [...].
B003UESJEM|5.0|This film takes place over the course of a year as a big company is downsizing; it centers around the lives of three men played by Ben Affleck, Chris Cooper and Tommy Lee Jones. The film doesn't break new ground or change the world, but it's a well acted, thoughtful portrait of how the economy affects peoples' lives, or at least white collar lives. The cast is great and the script is very good, but I didn't find any of the characters particularly compelling. Extras include an extended alternate ending, six deleted scenes and a commentary with writer-director John Wells, and a making-of documentary. I would give it 4-1/2 stars, especially if you like these actors or have been laid off.
0679805273|5.0|While most of Dr. Seuss books seem to be targeted at the really younger set, this classic definitely picks a specific group of people. The Graduate! Throughout, the narrative is upbeat and in the mind of the graduate these are all things and experiences that they will face in their more adult life. We had three grandchildren graduating from high school this year and presented each with a copy of this learner's manual. We hope they read the book and review Life's Great Balancing Act!
B0058YPGL6|5.0|J.J. Abrams is The Man. FRINGE, SUPER 8, etc. and now TEEN WOLF. His level of excellence is the best since Joss Whedon appeared. From now on, whenever/wherever I see the name J.J. Abrams, I'm going to pay attention. This show is too wonderful to watch on TV with commercials, superimposed logos, ads, ticker-tape across the bottom of the screen, previews, compressed illegible credits, ETC. ad nauseum. This show deserves respect. I will wait impatiently for this DVD release...
0061784788|2.0|I like early Rollins books. They do require some suspension of disbelief, but not too much. But his Sigma novels in general, and The Devil Colony in particular really set my teeth on edge. What do we have here? A wild and totally crazy mix of ancient nanotechnology, lost tribe of Israel, plus conspiracy theory about US history - well, it could be OK I guess. But when it is also mixed with autistic scientist-genius, Sigma members with high IQs who are portrayed as geniuses when they make simple conclusions out of simple data (any not mentally retarded teenager can do it), and shootouts and blasts on US university campuses, with a very high body count, I simply have no idea how to produce such a suspension of disbelief to accommodate THAT!!! I mean c'mon, just because it is scifi, it shouldn't be totally ridiculous! I put a novel down several times unable to proceed for being embarrassed for all this. It is rather curious that Jim Butchers's Dresden Files novels with all his fairies and demons are much more believable than Rollins' Sigma stuff.<br /><br />BTW, kindle price is unreasonable. That's why I borrowed a book from a friend.
1935670913|5.0|-    You, sir, have garnered my respect.  That's not an easy thing to do, but you did it.  I read through your entire book twice now in one sitting, and as a struggling self-published author, you hit me in a tender spot.    -    To be honest, I find myself mad.  Not angry, per say, but pulling-my-hair-out, stark-raving mad.  It is so simple.  I went back just now and reread your blog post advertising the book... You are a master of your own plan - and you know it.  -    I am also a part-time magician.  The feeling I'm left with after reading your book is the same one I feel after purchasing a dazzling new magic trick, only to find the method is frustratingly simple.  It's the \\"Why didn't I think of that?\\" feeling.  -    That being said, I cannot find myself angry with you in the same way I get grumpy with these magic trick inventors; you showed me how to make my own magic tricks.  And for that, sir, I can never thank you enough.    -    I am getting to work on my 'life-changing blog' as soon as I'm done with this message and I look forward to seeing what it can do for me.  -    Consider me added to you Guaranteed Buyer list.  ---Alexander P.

B003K1EYM6|4.0|I have iPad 2 and eos20d. I have no trouble transferring photos. You just first need to make a change in your camera setting in the camera menu. If you google the fix, you'll find the solution. It works great.  I do wish the photos were organized by date though, when transferred--that would give a 5 star review.
0316056863|4.0|If one section of this book didn't seem funny, insightful and/or interesting I just had to wait a chapter or two to be enthralled again. I plan to try to live by Fey's rules of improvisation which she says changed her life and the way she looked at the world and even reduced her belly fat (though she later took that last claim back.) Also great to read are her descriptions of her fiercely geeky teen years, the list of things she learned from Lorne Michaels at Saturday Night Live (like producing means quashing creativity), her Harvard nerds/ Chicago improvisers formula for success, her attempts to balance show business and motherhood, and her take on sexism in show business and politics in the lead up to the 2008 election during which she was doing her almost unbearably funny impersonations of Sarah Palin.
0307477479|1.0|The virtually unopposed glowing press, the awards, and some reviewers here would have you believe that this book is dynamically perched on the edge of a volcano, when instead it anemically hangs on the edge of a toilet stool.  The emperor truly wears no clothes with \\"...Goon Squad,\\" which like Egan's other books is no more than a light beach read.  Powerpoint section?  You must be kidding.  David Foster Wallace-lite touches throughout more than anyone since \\"Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" strutted in as if Vanilla Ice called himself NWA.     I am including a prescient reply by author Carole Maso to a Barcelona Review interviewer from eleven years ago.  This is apt beyond apt and \\"...Goon Squad\\" is a firm example of the ludicrous masquerade of which she speaks:    BR: ...Who poses the bigger threat--the academics who prescribe policy or the commercial publishers focused on their profit margins?    CM: I'm not feeling as bleak as many on this one. I do believe that big publishers will become more and more absurd, publishing less and less of any value whatsoever and it will become increasingly clear that this is simply not where serious work is available anymore. It will become more and more vulgar and trashy and formulaic, I think. Today you see all kinds of so-called serious fiction that is nothing more than pretentious versions of Hollywood movies and soon enough big time publishing will just be one arm of that miserable industry. Publishers of the usual crap which masquerades as innovative or cutting edge or \\"transgressive,\\" whatever-- which they justify by economics, market research, the buying public etc.--will become archaic, obsolete and even more ludicrous than they are already. And far more transparent I think.
B004ZJADNQ|4.0|**** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 'Expanded Version' ****<br /><br />After the bad taste the last 3 Lizzy Deluxe Editions seem to leave in many fans mouths (advertised as new remasters, Universal simply used the 1996 versions and didn't change the booklets or adverts) - I'm glad to say this reissue of Lizzy's much-loved 8th album \\"Bad Reputation\\" is a real improvement on the former 1996 outing - and packs some nice surprises in the bonus department too.<br /><br />Tracks 1 to 9 are the original LP \\"Bad Reputation\\" released 2 September 1977 on Vertigo Records 9102 016 in the UK and on Mercury SRM1-1186 in the USA. It peaked at Number 4 in the UK album charts and at 49 in the US. This June 2011 'Expanded Edition' CD on Universal/Mercury 2772693 adds on 6 bonus tracks and breaks down as follows (57:24 minutes):<br /><br />Tracks 10 to 15 are \\"Killer Without A Cause\\", \\"Bad Reputation\\", \\"That Woman's Gonna Break Your Heart\\", \\"Dancing In Moonlight (It's Caught Me In Its Spotlight)\\" and \\"Downtown Sundown\\" - all are Previously Unreleased - a BBC Session Recorded 1 August 1977 (no other details provided).<br /><br />Track 16 is \\"Me And The Boys (Soundcheck)\\" - this version is Previously Unreleased - no details are provided as to where or when this live recording was made...<br /><br />The expanded 16-page booklet has new liner notes (doesn't say who wrote them) and features the album's original inner sleeve along with some new live photos of the band in both colour and black and white. It's nice, but oddly doesn't reference the bonus tracks at all except to list their titles (I mean 'Soundcheck' - where, when?)<br /><br />The remaster was carried out by ANDY PEARCE and MATT WORTHAM at Wired Masters in the UK in 2010 - and the sound is much improved. The 1996 version always seemed slightly muffled - muddy almost - but each track here is very clear - especially the rhythm section. I've always loved the slightly romantic feel to \\"Southbound\\", \\"Downtown Sundown\\" and \\"Dear Lord\\" - and each sounds great - really clear, punchy without being overly cranked for effect. The irrepressible \\"Dancing In The Moonlight...\\" (lyrics above) leaps out of the speakers at you. The only two I found slightly underwhelming are \\"Soldier Of Fortune\\" and \\"Opium Trail\\" - maybe there's just too much going on in the tracks - but they sound even more 'dense' that before - and not in a good way - but obviously it's a matter of personal taste.<br /><br />Amazingly, the opening two BBC tracks \\"Killer Without A Cause\\" and \\"Bad Reputation\\" start out sounding like the band live-in-the-studio (exciting and alive), but the next three end up sounding like polished overdubbed versions which are virtually indistinguishable from the album cuts. On the opening two, you really feel the songs coming alive - and the sheer rocking tightness of the group who'd been touring their wrinkled butts off for years - shines through also. There's a rush of excitement on the first two - the last three are just a little 'too' polished - almost sedate.<br /><br />And then you're presented with a truly astonishing diamond in the rough - a genuine Thin Lizzy bonus track gem. \\"Me And The Boys\\" first turned up as a crowd-storming track on the \\"Live And Dangerous\\" double in 1978 (its also famously featured on the video of the concert), but it disappointingly wasn't on the DE version of \\"Live & Dangerous\\" in 2010. Well - here it is - albeit in a 'Soundcheck' version - and it's ragged and absolutely amazing. This is what Lizzy fans have craved - their band rocking like an absolute monster - tight even when they were shambolic. As I say - it's messy - but man is it good!<br /><br />To sum up - despite the booklet being slightly disjointed - the remaster is great and the bonus tracks - proper fan pleasers.<br /><br />I remember being at Dalymount Park in Dublin (a football stadium) in the Summer of 1977 when Lizzy were at their peak - Phil pointing the reflection plate of his black bass through the crowd as the light caught it in the approaching evening. He was laying into the cool lyrics of \\"Dancing In The Moonlight...\\" and the whole place was boogieing - I remember thinking just how 'magic' they were.<br /><br />I like it that this CD has brought some of that vibe back to me after all these years... Recommended.ool lyrics of \\"Dancing In The Moonlight...\\" and the whole place was boogieing - I remember thinking just how 'magic' they were.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|THE OUTLANDER SERIES IS MY FAVORITE HISTORICAL ROMANCE OF ALL TIME AND VOYAGER IS MY FAVORITE OF THE SERIES.  THIS SERIES SHOULD BE READ IN ORDER THERE IS NOT ONE THAT STANDS ALONE. THIS BOOK CONTAINS MY FAVORITE WRITTEN SCENE IN ANY BOOKS TO DATE. I LITERALLY HELD MY BREATHE WHEN CLAIRE GOES BACK TO EDINBURGH AND SEES JAMIE AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME I CRIED MY EYES OUT. I HAVE MET COMPLETE STRANGERS (MOSTLY WOMEN OF COURSE) ON PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES AND WHEN THE DISCUSSION TURNS TO BOOKS THERE IS NOT A ONE WHO HAS NOT READ THIS SERIES AND LOVED IT. SO IFYOU ARE A HISTORICAL ROMANCE FAN AND HAVE NOT READ \\"OUTLANDER\\" THEN YOU CAN NOT REALLY CALL YOUR SELF A TRUE FAN.
B004XQO90O|4.0|`Source Code' does what `[[ASIN:B0012QCZ5O Vantage Point (Single-Disc Edition)]]' tried to do, but failed.  It makes us look at a public scene where some imminent violence or calamity is about to take place, and then backs up to show us the same scene again with a different point-of-view.  (Except this time, the protagonist relives the same moments and scenes on a commuter train.)  As has been stated time and time again, `Source Code''s method may be preposterous science fiction--like anime' adventure `[[ASIN:B000VWYJ68 Paprika]]--' but its thrust is decidedly more closely aligned to `[[ASIN:B000Z8GZYW Groundhog Day (Special 15th Anniversary Edition)]]'.<br /><br />The story begins with a disoriented Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who finds himself on a commuter train headed to Chicago.  Next to him is a woman identifying herself as his girlfriend, Christine (Michelle Monaghan).  A series of events take place:  Someone spills coffee on his shoe; he gets up; someone knocks over a file with papers in it; and he goes to the bathroom where a mirror shows him to be someone else than he knows himself to be.<br /><br />After several awkward moves, he sees his train pass another train, and both blow up into oblivion...Then, we are taken into a military vessel, much resembling a small space unit, where Colter is received on a screen with instructions from Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who gets him to use a \\"source code\\" technology, which enables him to relive the scene, find information, and prevent otherwise inevitable catastrophe.<br /><br />He fights the mission with a fervent confusion--not able to fully comprehend when he was on an earlier mission--not in incognito and on the war front of Afghanistan.  To get him on track, Goodwin and her superior officer, Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), have to brief him as quickly as possible because their intelligence program is in experimental infancy with many harrowing risks for Colter and civilization at large...<br /><br />Thecausality of `Source Code' is easily as fanciful as `[[ASIN:B002ZG980U Inception]],' but the story is much easier to follow, and the format and development admirably suspend disbelief in ways that few movies do.  While similar movies can be awkwardly paced, tediously unfolded, or convoluted beyond our senses, `Source Code' is satisfying popcorn entertainment with an admirable message about the brevity and preciousness of life without ever being weighed down by stale or labored moments.<br /><br />(Credit information is taken from IMDB.com)
B00005JMCN|5.0|I love this movie. It's not just about a race horse, it's about will power and human character. What people can do when they are driven. Everyone could learn something about working hard and striving to be better even when the odds are against you.
0553386794|5.0|I'm new to fantasy books, but this is honestly the the most interesting and thought provoking books I have ever read. Fairly complex plot to follow with so many different stories going on, but I recommend this to everyone I know.
0670022411|5.0|I loved this novel.  I thought that Deborah Harkness did a great job bringing us into her world of deamons, vampires and witches.  Her writing is lovely, and I loved Matthew and Diana and cannot wait for the sequel.  Enjoy. You won't be disappointed.
0393338827|4.0|I'd like to keep this a short, enthusiastic recommendation.    1) the term \\"Bankster\\" is too kind, maybe \\"Stupid Bankster\\" is more apropos  2) This book doesn't cover Congress' instigation of the sub-prime disaster.    A VERY interesting read.  Somewhat complicated in spots, but quite readable  and mostly within grasp of readers with some knowledge of investing.    This reader is still waiting for promoters of this 'once in a lifetime' scam  to go to jail.
B004DMIIUU|5.0|Wonderfull movie, excelent adaptation and excelent digital work. In momments this movie transport you in a world like a video game.
1936719118|5.0|I just finished Derek Sivers new book, Anything You Want. What a great read! In case you don't know who Sivers is, he was the Founder of CD Baby, the largest online seller of independent music. He grew it from nothing in 1998 then sold it to Disc Makers for 22 million in 2008. Not bad for what started as a little hobby!<br /><br />Now I've read my share of business books over the years and most are (yawn) boring, long and full of fluff. Not his book. This hardcover is 77 pages of great information and advice dished out in 40 lessons. It was hard to put down.<br /><br />Sivers gives the reader ten years of his business experience in one hour. Yes, you can sit down with this book and read it cover to cover in about an hour. He talks about how he turned a hobby of selling his own music online as well as helping his friends do the same. Mind you, this was happening several years before PayPal came about. Sivers was definitely ahead of his time! He recounts stories and ideas that helped him shape his business into a huge success. This is not just a business book. It's a great motivational read too. Insightful and interesting. Again, hard to put it down. You'll see.<br /><br />Here are some of my favorite pieces of advice:<br /><br />* Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what's not working.<br />* Don't waste years fighting uphill battles against locked doors. Improve or invent until you get that huge response.<br />* Care about your customers more than about yourself, and you'll do well.<br />* The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you happy.<br /><br />Get yourself a copy of Anything You Want today. You'll thank me.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|The down side to this movie is that it confirms what we already know, but hate to admit.  You may decide that another country would be a better quality of life.  I have always wondered how my family members (from other countries) find the time and money to take annual vacations for 3-4 weeks across the world.  Perhaps Europeans, South Americans, and Asians have something that we don't afterall.  USA needs to evolve in health care or face the consequences.  Knowledge is king.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This is one of the great, heart-felt stories in the world. This book follows the unlikely friendship of a young German boy and a Jewish boy imprisoned in a concentration camp in Poland. I'm obviously not going to spoil the ending, but I will say that it is emotional and brings a few tears to your eyes. I would recommend this book to every living person on earth.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|ok i got this just the other day and i LOVE IT i take it everywhere it didn't come with the paper but im still satisfied i dont see how you can accidentally break it i have accidentally dropped it and thrown it across the room more times than David Tennent for sure, it is incredible that it still works. i have only one complaint, that there is no button on the slider but on the side and it only works in fully extended or fully retracted other than that it was perfect and im still playing with it right now.      by the way, i got it for free at [...] no charge what so ever.  so take a look if your interested!
B0058VW36U|3.0|I guess it's not the fault of the game, but for some people these type of games pose an almost insurmountable challenge, which kind of takes the fun out. I would much rather enjoy defense games like Plants vs Zombies, where hand eye coordination is not nearly as important.
B0057AOOZ0|5.0|I thought this album was well done.  I think Beyonce was trying to go with a little bit of a different sound, but still bring in a piece of herself ... I think it worked well.  I read a review about the song \\"Run the World\\", the author said the song was \\"childish\\" and I disagree whole-heartedly.  If you dont like the song, you just dont like it, but I think Beyonce tries to create music to empower women.  It is music, you cant take it (or yourself for that matter) too seriously.    There is a mix of upbeat and slow songs.  I find myself playing the album all the way through without finding the need to skip past songs.  I havent had an album in a while I could do that with.     I enjoy this album ... hopefully you will too.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Good Drama and sets. Of course some of the play does not fit ancient reports as to what happened at that time, but that's the director and author's opinion.
B0031TZ9VW|1.0|As I'm reading the other reviews for this book.. I am very surprised they are mainly positive. I'm an avid book reader.. I like to be charmed and I like to feel something when I read a book. I like happy endings, but they don't all have to happy. This book definitely made me feel something, depression. This is honestly one of the worst books I've ever read. I honestly don't understand why someone who write a story like this.    Two newly wed virgins on their honeymoon.. the boy is worried about how his performance will be, and the girl is simply repulsed by the idea of sex. I can understand both of their emotions and the book leading up to this part, aside all of the babbling, is reasonably good. During the act, the young man comes too early and his wife runs away. This to me is pretty much where the book ends. They have this fight when he runs after her, and nothing gets resolved. She walks away and they live two completely separate lives. They give up after one conflict on their first day of being married, and thats it.. I wasted a good chunk of my day reading half of this book to get nowhere.     I understand that sex back in those days was thought of differently by some woman and also taking into account of how she was raised, but her parents had sex and so did their parents. She (florence) even mentions how she wanted children.. so have some with your husband. It's not all her fault either though.. there was no communication and her husband let her walk away.     It was a horrible book that left me with a horrible feeling. I only gave this book 1 star because it wouldn't let me give only half a star.     My advice, this book is not worth the time to read.. in the end you will have gained nothing and there are other books that will give the same amount of cultural and historical information without leaving you with that \\"ick\\" feeling.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I've never written reviews before, but this book got me so excited!! I love Abby and Travis, they are a beautiful disaster.

0767817664|5.0|After I finished reading the truly horrible script for the 2011 remake of Fright Night I found myself with a new appreciation of the original movie.<br /><br />  Peter Vincent is probably the most enjoyable character in this film.  Roddy McDowall stole the show as the slightly cowardly TV horror host who grows a spine and rises to be the heroic vampire killer he had always pretended to be.  The soundtrack is incredible.  The acting is brilliant.<br /><br />  I have always loved Gothic Horror, particularly the old Hammer horror films such as what Peter Vincent shows on his TV show.  Not only do I not see a purpose in the Fright Night remake but I feel it fails on my many levels where the original excels.  The vampires of the original Fright night had the powers of Dracula, himself. They could turn into horrible little bats, or wolves, or mist.  They could enthrall human wills and could show up on film as a human might.  In the remake they have no such abilities and this is not so-well compensated by an excess of explosions.<br />  The writer of the remake claims that horror movie hosts don't exist anymore.  Not only is this not true but there are more horror movie hosts on TV AND Internet today than there ever were on TV in 1985.  Elvira's Movie Macabre, Mystery science theater 3000, Nostalgia Critic, just to name a few...  I think they made a huge mistake in changing Peter Vincent to a nearly unrecognizable stage magician in the remake.  If anything the movie host is more relatable now than ever before.<br /><br />  Skip the remake, stick with the original. It makes more sense. It has more accessible characters.  Peter Vincent actually has depth rather than the show pretense of depth with the added backstory given in the remake.  Charlie is a lot nicer and a lot more sympathetic in the  original. And this one had memorable and catchy songs on the soundtrack. The vampires are more frightening while at the same time more charming and strangely sympathetic while also terrifying and deadly.  The humor isn't forced and there's no obnoxious product placement.  The remake...  has none of these qualities.  This is by far the superior film.  Skip the remake, kids.  Stick with the original!etic while also terrifying and deadly.  The humor isn't forced and there's no obnoxious product placement.  The remake...  has none of these qualities.   This is by far the superior film.  Skip the remake, kids.  Stick with the original!
B0050LJIRK|5.0|Limp Bizkit has gone back to their original state.  This album is great.  If you liked \\"Significant Other\\" and \\"Chocolate Starfish\\" you'll like this album.
B0057XSCJG|1.0|Wooden acting, trite story line, completely unintegrated secondary characters, a dragging pace...there really could not be anything more wrong with this film.  Now we know why it wasn't going to be released initially - it took Pettyfer's \\"pop\\" in I Am Number 4 to get this to the box office.  They were right the first time.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|We all know what type of movie this was.  They should have a law to follow the formula this movie has.
B0012GMWCU|5.0|I have to agree with one reviewer that the critic can't have listened to the album or just does not like blues cuz this is what it's all about. Willie Dixon wrote and performed more great blues over his lifetime, along with promoting up and coming blue musicians to the joy of all of us. This will be a well played favorite of mine for sure. My only complaint is that the liner notes, as noted, are from the original album and do not make mention of the individual artists playing except to say that they are \\"his hand picked crew of Chicago blue veterans\\". I really would like to know who the guitar player and especially the harp player, are? Anyway, if you love Willie Dixon, I think you'll love this album.
B00454U1O2|4.0|I love Pink but have elementary school aged children, so I ordered this version and hoped I'd be receiving the radio versions of her songs.  Not so.  The worst offenders are simply 'silented' out, instead of the modified lyrics I hear on the radio.  Having the song go silent for a couple of beats is disappointing.
0385338910|5.0|I have read several of Jonathan Tropper's novels and while I have enjoyed them all this was my favorite. The characters are created in a very accessible way - they seem familiar and at the same time just a bit funnier and more interesting than anyone you know.     The multiple story lines, when described to someone who hasn't read the book seem both outlandish and juvenile, but somehow they come together to form one story that makes you happy, sad and angry all at the same time.  I couldn't wait to see how the story unfolded and at the same time I didn't want to reach the end of the book.
0316056863|2.0|I guess I was expecting more from this book. Do I feel like I got to know the real Tiny Fey, the answer is No. Instead of writing an autobiography she just gave small snippets of her life but no real story on how she made it. Her book had a lot of complaining. Why is she complaining, she has a great family, great job and money

B00007AJF8|5.0|Have you ever wanted to feel what its really like in a another persons body? How about a famous person? How about John Malkovich? Well this is a complete & thorough study of what that might be like and what could go wrong if that experience was available to pretty much anyone willing to pay a small price. This is actually a very interesting movie that came out in the very interesting year of 1999. It stars John Malkovich, John Cusack (one of the greatest hopeless romantics of all time, this guy never wins), Cameron Diaz, and Cathrine Keener all in arguably career defining roles. This film is a tour de force in strange and abstract film making. It is experimental cinema at its finest. The concept of entering the mind of John Malcovich is stretched in many different ways. The meaning behind Being John Malkovich could be interpreted exponentially. It is a success because it ultimately comes down to what is going on inside your head while you are watching this strange and bizarre gem.<br /><br />John Malcovich: I got to know the truth!<br /><br />Charlies Sheen: Truth is for suckers, Johnny Boy.
B000QRIGLC|3.0|I am very impressed by the SEALs, their training and Luttrell's courage, fighting ability and will to survive. I was, however, surprised to find that the book had a co-author because it did not come across as well-written. But more off-putting was the unfounded heaping of blame placed on the \\"liberal media\\" and his blanket admiration of George W. Bush. I understand the oath he took but, for example, when talking about his time in Iraq searching for WMD nowhere is there acknowledgement that none was ever found because there wasn't any to be found. This book isn't a complete waste of time but it is no Black Hawk Down.
0553386794|3.0|With this story I wanted to be present with what was happening, but the authors choice of writing style did not allow it. The passive voice and god perspective are both present within the narrative of Game of Thrones, and the end result is a good story with lazy writing. This story deserved to be written in active language, and in a way that shows the story happen not tells you what HAPPENED. Unfortunately, too many writers passively in order to cover more ground within their stories, and while it may be necessary for large ones like this, the reader doesn't get the full experience. Thus, Game of Thrones was a bitter sweet venture for me, but it's a good story and I would still recommend it to anyone.
7119005901|4.0|Right off of the bat, if your only exposure to the Three Kingdoms story is playing the Dynasty Warriors line of video games, this collection might be going right over your head. Especially if you are not a big fan of actually reading. Although there are pictures present, they are few and far between. The bulk of this book is going to be left to your imagination.    In the games the story centers around a select cast of characters, as grand as that amount may be they pale in comparison to the amount of characters that fill this book. You will see so many names flash across your eyes that it will become difficult to tell the difference between a majority of them due to the way the story is told. You don't follow one character from beginning to end like most Western type folklores, here you are looking at the story from the viewpoint of the entire country of China. Good guys and bad guys together, all at the same time.    For me personally, I find it quite refreshing. There are areas where characters are focused upon that I don't favor as much as say Liu Bei, Lu Bu or Cao Cao but I also appreciate the importance they play in the story overall.    Three Kingdoms at it's heart is a story of many men, and the struggle a select few endured in order to become main characters. Any of the no name and less favorable characters could have just a easily become a Cao Cao, or a Sun, but they did not due to their actions and the weaknesses they chose to strengthen.    Overall, this is a great book to hold a mirror up to your own actions and realize that in order to become a main character in the story of our lives, you have to pay attention to what you are doing before challenges arrive. Every little thing you do must be moving you closer to your goal, if not you will easily be swallowed up once you cross paths with someone who has been.    Lead your life through ambitious means, that is the story of the Three Kingdoms.    *Side Note - I deducted a star due to the amount of typos in the book. Other than that, I highly recommend this to any fan of historical literature.\\"

159514188X|4.0|I remember a girl almost thirty years ago who felt the same way as Hannah, but I'm glad to say I don't know her anymore. At the time, all those things that seemed so huge--rumors, boys, snubs--were a reflection of the true me, I felt, since I had no life experiences in which I had proven myself and learned to ignore the negativity. What I saw was exactly what I felt was mirrored in other people's eyes.    Three decades later, with education, career, marriage and kids behind me, it's hard to imagine someone taking their life over such a trivial set of thirteen reasons. I found myself reading the book in two days and scoffing at Hannah like so many adults. I thought, \\"She's got her whole life ahead of her. High school means nothing.\\" But then I remembered that what goes on inside one's head can be their reality, and for Hannah, life had become painfully unbearable. It's easy for adults to say \\"Get over it\\", because we can see over the other side. Hannah couldn't. I think I do understand, even if I can no longer summon those feelings.    Sometimes it really IS something major.
0312600844|4.0|I have an odd tendency to revisit other people's reviews at several points in my journey with a book: before I buy it, while I'm immersed in it, and after I'm done.  I avoid spoilers and do aim to find my own opinion, but I'm just really interested in how other people react to the same text.  I probably need a book club...    Anyway, Freedom reviews are HUGELY varied (and you can find plot summaries in many of them but not here).  This holds true on both Amazon and Goodreads (I find the latter is a bit more of a book-serious crew).  I think it may depend on what the reader likes to get out of books.  I like characters.  Well-developed characters with warts and all that grow and change but are also still themselves.  I do NOT need to LIKE the characters...and I think that's where Franzen lost a lot of folks.  These characters aren't all that likeable.  I'm not looking to be friends with them or striving to be like them.  But they were very real (I'm reminded of a poem line \\"imaginary gardens with real toads in them\\"...Marianne Moore hit what I want in texts on the head there).    A lot does happen in the book.  I don't always need that in my reads, but there are many plot lines and events and it really spans the lifetimes of some characters.  At times, I did feel like it got to be TOO much (esp the plotline of the son, Joey).  The number of big events made it a bit too much of a stretch at times...I prefer my characters to develop more \\"normally\\", I'm fine for a few big shocker events to make it all interesting, but this got a bit much.    I'm confident that this hits four stars for me (not one of my more common 3.5 rounding cases).  I like Franzen and I saw the same author here as in The Corrections.  Both are BIG books, physically and in scope as they examine modern American lives including families and individuals.  It isn't much of a beach read (if only b/c it is HEAVY in weight) but it could be a good summer read if that means you have he time to really delve into its world.
B002SEW5WW|3.0|For their second album, OneRepublic mastermind Ryan Tedder must have woken up and decided if a lot of production was terrific, than over-production would be fabulous. As a songwriter to the stars (he counts Adele and Beyonce for resume points), he certainly knows his way around songwriting and hooks. But for a writer with so many soul and R'n'B artists on his Rolodex, when it comes to his own material, Tedder aims squarely at the rafters of the world's arenas, with a jealous eye towards the likes of Muse.<br /><br />Take \\"All The Right Moves.\\" The first song on the disc may be \\"Made For You,\\" but that song ends with a children's choir that sings the \\"All The Right Moves\\" anthemic chorus just before the bombastic percussion for the song itself bursts in. Strings swell as Tedder arcs his voice for a final soaring falsetto on the chorus' catchy hook. same with \\"Secrets,\\" where Tedder takes a page from his mentor Timbaland and mixes rap verses with a high flying chorus and more strings. Or the closer, \\"Lullaby.\\" Every bit as sedate as the title suggests, it's also twice as earnest as it probably needs to be. \\"Waking Up\\" contains bombast, but it's a good kind of bombast.<br /><br />Problem is, after awhile, you wish he'd just pull in the reins a little. The title track is such an obvious U2 clone that you wonder if Tedder stole it from an early draft of \\"Spiderman: Turn Off The Dark.\\" The militaristic drumming of \\"Marching On\\" is overkill, even if the left, left, left right left hook is unshakable. The hooks throughout \\"Waking Up\\" are the calling card; they show exactly why Tedder has become such a go-to guy for the stars. Even my favorite song here, \\"Everybody Loves Me,\\" strikes the perfect balance of snappy beats and earworm.

0307946711|4.0|In someways this is a book about rather \\"obvious\\" or cliche characters.    Young girl/woman who is very smart, kind, loyal, funny and lovely to look at continually sabotages herself because she has so little self confidence.  She especially doesn't believe she is lovely.    Young man who in contrast has absolutely no doubts about how very attractive he is and who feels he is \\"smart enough\\" but is continually derailed from his line of thought and any kind of reasoning by the sneak peek of a bra strap under a summer dress, some woman on the street tossing her hair, the glimpse of an ankle, a neck, a hand. All enough to tantalize his young mind.  As I say, cliche characters.    BUT, I came to love the book.    At times (okay, over and over) I became irritated at the choices Dexter and Emma made. As would surely anyone. That's a good thing! The characters became real to me.  Emma in particular. We are told over and over that she is Smaaaart, but until later in the book I couldn't really see why, other than she was very politically aware and her never ending supply of off the cuff witty comments were certainly spot on and sharp. I really enjoyed her droll sense of humour but she made some stupid choices that is for sure. I wanted to shake her at times.  Don't we all know smart people who do stupid things. Perhaps there have even been times in my life when I could have done with a good shaking, maybe one time, or half a time ...  Yep, I think a lot of women will be able to identify with Emma, at least on some level.     While I was reading the book I felt like it was good but not great . . .the ending, however, made it great for me.  I keep thinking about it! What, if on one day, a different choice had been made, a small choice, how big would the differences have been? I think we all like to ponder that unponderable stuff now and then. The ending was so poignant and the way their first day was eventually and finally pulled together and painted with words was subtle and gentle and so powerful. At least to me.    Perhaps I am especially moved by the story because while in no way at all is \\"my story\\" similar, other than I met my husband in 1988 and I am English (living in the USA)  I was able to draw at least some comparisons. The time frame, the same passing years, the sense of place at the beginning.     To that end (the place) I do wonder if an American reader might be left wondering what certain words or phrases mean. There is indeed a lot of English \\"slang\\" used in the book . .although in context I would imagine it is pretty easy to gather what is being said and the language shouldn't cause any problems other than a \\"huh, what\\" moment here or there. I apprectiate that Dexter and Emma's language was not Americanized.

0439023513|2.0|...there are no Hunger Games in Mockingjay.  Clearly the intent of the author was to recreate the Hunger Games idea on a much larger scale, with the District rebels symbolically led by Katniss fighting to take down the Capitol government led by President Snow.  The sheer number of deaths that are placed into the battle scenes in the second half of the book seem to support this, as so many minor characters are introduced to the story that it is somewhat difficult to keep track of who is who as they all get killed off one after another a few chapters after we first meet them.  The ultimate ending of the book is, of course, quite predictable, as there is no doubt that Katniss and the rebels will eventually triumph over the Capitol.  Where the book falls short is that it seems to take forever to get to that point as character after character is killed off and Katniss can't seem to go ten pages without having a mental breakdown, on numerous occasions running off to hide in a closet or laundry room for hours or days at a time.  These scenes of mental anguish and confusion happen one after another after another, and became quite tedious to read after the first few.  The frightened yet still independent, resourceful, and tough Katniss from the first book is sorely missed in this one.    The high point of the trilogy is undoubtedly the description of the first Hunger Games, which is replicated (though not quite as well) in Catching Fire.  Mockingjay just isn't at the same level.  The overarching message of the final book seems to be that war is bad - well yeah, I doubt any of the readers disagree with that.  Where Mockingjay fails is that it does not provide anything near as compelling or exciting as the Hunger Games from the first two books to go along with that message.  We know what is going to happen.  We know which of the two love interests Katniss will end up with at the end - if there was any doubt, the events of the early part of the book remove it immediately.  Eventhe \\"surprise\\" moments are a bit predictable, as Katniss comes to realize that she has more enemies than she had originally thought.  It's just too bad that Katniss almost always comes to these realizations about 100 pages after the reader has already caught on.    Ultimately, it's probably worth reading Mockingjay if you have already read the first two books of the series.  If I ever read any of these books again though, I'll just stick with the fantastic Hunger Games and leave the last two books on the shelf.
0525423273|5.0|I loved Anna and the French Kiss from the very first chapter! I remember what it was like being wrapped in high school with everything that's going on and all that you hope to accomplish before high school is over. I would have been pretty upset too if I was pulled out of my life to complete the last year of high school in a foreign country. Anger, frustration, betrayal and loneliness is what you get from the main character in the beginning and rightly so.<br /><br />The relationship between St. Clair and Anna is so intense right from the beginning so it becomes a little frustrating that they remain just friends for so long. But the writing is exquisite and Perkins describes every little flirty detail between the two of them; every slight touch of the hand, all the phone calls and emails and every small and meaningful look. Even Anna's tone changes when their relationship changes. Instead of calling him St. Clair she, more intimately, calls him Etienne.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins writes teenagers so perfectly from both the male and the female perspective. Anna over analyzes every look and every word that passes between her and St. Clair. He likes me but he doesn't; he wants to be my friend, well maybe he wants more. St. Clair is struggling over reasons why he should and shouldn't break up with his current girlfriend. Neither are sure if the other one likes them so there's constant flirting and unspoken words.<br /><br />I really loved Anna and the French Kiss and Stephanie Perkins really knows how to weave a story of love and heartbreak; making cry in one chapter and completely bringing me back up in the next. I just hope that Lola and the Boy Next Door is just as good!
1416914307|5.0|LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  I couldn't have hoped for a better ending to this series.  Then I found out.... it's not the end after all.  WHAT????  This book was so well done, all the loose ends tied up for us in a pretty little bow and now there's more.  I'm a bit torn as to whether I should even read the next book or not.  But I digress.    As much as I loved the way this book ended I have to say that the whole thing was fantastic.  All of the characters are still growing and developing.  While Jace still has the snark and sarcasim he did in the beginning, he's let some walls down.  Especially where Clary is concerned.  He's not hiding his feelings or the torment he feels about how his relationship with her has to be.  There are some truly touching scenes with these two.  We even get some closure for Alec and Magnus which I appreciated because while I kind of thought Alec was a wet blanket for the most part, I really love Magnus!!!    I also really liked that the story moved to the land of Idris, home of the Shadowhunters!  We have heard so much about this land and it's importance that it felt very poignant to have all of the resolution take place here.  Hooray for a fantastic series!!!!
B00425S1H8|3.0|The device installed fine and I was able to use this to connect to my Cisco devices. Everything was working fine for awhile but then I received a blue screen. I'm 100% sure that the blue screen was caused by this device - I have no evidence to prove it, although my computer has never blue screened in the past and I am computer savvy enough to know that I didn't make any other changes on my system. I am running Windows 7 Professional x64.<br /><br />Within the first three days of using the driver enclosed with the disc, I encountered a blue screen three times so far. Others using this product have experienced BSOD when using PuTTY with this device. Consider this if you are using PuTTY, an alternate editor like WinSCP.<br /><br />Before you buy, try a little more research on other items... this may still be the best buy out there.<br /><br />UPDATE: There is a newer driver available on Plugables website and I am trying it out now.
1416914293|5.0|I have a new love in my life and his name is Jace.  What a fantasticly written male lead!  I don't want to leave out Clary but she's taking a while to grow on me.  I will say that she grows quite a bit in this installment.  She seems to stand up for what she wants and for her friends and that in itself is a huge improvement.  Clare continues to build on a fantastic world filled with demons, vampires, werewolves and warlocks.  LOVE IT!!!    This part of the story is so filled with action compared to the first book which is good but mostly setting up the Shadowhunter/Downworlder world.  Valentine's character is developed more as well.  She writes him so well that you ALMOST feel sorry for him.  He really believes that what he's doing is for the better of the world.  Great action scenes and character/world development.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children was a book not quite like any other .. I have not come across a book like it before.   Jacob is close to his grandfather and is fond of his wondurous and amazing stories but when something happens that leaves him wondering .. He decides to investigate the home itself and the strange children his grandfather told him about on a small island off the coast of Wales. Well then you'll need to read the book to find out what happens. But once he gets there, the story takes a deep plunge of spooky twists and turns .. This book had me up late at night .   Full of suspense, drama and of course Jacobs finds a romance on the island. The author made the story an amazing journey and a pleasure to read . AND OF COURSE ... ! Pictures of the strange and curious children and people are scattered amongst the book , adding to the excitement.  Overall .. This book is really great and I believe its for all ages ... the book will leave you curious and in suspense . Wanting more !
0062060554|3.0|I ordered this book on Kindle after reading some reviews and sat back to enjoy a read.  Though I'm not a super-fast reader, I finished in 3.5 hours, skipping about the last third of the main section and diving into the final chapter.  Don't feel like I missed a thing.  The writing keeps you going but is easy to speed through at times, especially when journal entries repeat.  But I DID want to finish this book badly and see the whole end.  There is an aura of \\"suspense\\" as you read along which the author uses well page-to-page at times.  The ending is just OK, followed by cheesy closing pages.<br />Another negative is the frequent use of sex to spice things up in the reading, and this feels like an obvious pacer to me.  She sees his thingy bobbing in the air and almost giggles... etc.  Come on.  F word used throughout is supposed to add realism I guess, but just distracts for me.  All-in-all I feel like I spent a bit too much buying it for Kindle.
0439023521|5.0|This book I picked up because of a review I skimmed over in a magazine. Before I knew it I had finished all 3 books in less then a week. They are fast paced, with wonderful characters who capture your heart and dont let go. I only hope everyone enjoys these as much as I did. Also Im keeping my fingers crossed that Hollywood wont screw up when they make the movies.

B001DF68MA|2.0|I was very excited to get this product; my son has been dying to ride our bikes with us since the spring. I was VERY disappointed upon receipt. Description claimed that it would seat a child up to 45lbs. My 2 year old toddler at 28lbs was cramped. It also claimed that the seat and mounting bar would fit \\"almost any\\" bicycle type. Well, I have 3 different bikes (6, if you count my wife's bikes that are identical except for size); mountain, hybrid, and road. The bar would not fit on any of them. Basically, this seat will only fit on a cheap bicycle. So, anyone that has a decent bike because they like to ride (and one would assume that is the type of person spending $60 for a toddler seat) is out of luck.

0316069353|5.0|I was totally shocked at the number of bad reviews this has gotten-and totally put off at the low stars given because of the Kindle price.<br /><br />I believe that this may be the best Connelly book yet (or at least right up there with \\"The Scarecrow\\").<br /><br />As an attorney (and a picky reader--just check out my other reviews if you don't believe me), I am always leary of non-lawyers writing courtroom scenes (or Grisham in his most recent books).  However, Connelly nails it--the rulings, the objections, the testimony, generally the tension that is involved in any high profile criminal case just oozes off the page.<br /><br />The plot is interesting--and unlike so many other lawyer novels.  Our hero (and a hero with feet of clay as we well know) is defending an utterly unlikable human being.  And once he's in, he's stuck with her for financial reasons.  Not unlike a lot of real life attorneys.<br /><br />There are subplots--romantically as well as professionally--but the story moves well.  As usual, Mickey's posse of friends, family and coworkers play important roles and there is even a new associate who plays a modern day Greek chorus/conscience of the king.<br /><br />I completely recommend this book to any mystery readers, legal fiction lovers, or someone who just needs a good summer book.

B004NJC0B6|4.0|The only reason I would rate this down a star is that I'm disappointed in the 5.1 mix (should say 3.1) as there's absolutely nothing coming from the rear speakers.  The sound is quite good for what's there & the picture is AMAZING, great HD transfer there.  The sound should be much more powerful considering the band involved, but have been waiting for this on DVD for eight years so not complaining too much.  Really pleased to see this old Bon footage finally put out in this format.  Da' Wolf
0143038419|3.0|Yes, if I had a $200,000 advance, I probably would have done something different than spending it on myself.  And yes, other people have gone through worse than a nasty divorce.  But that's what this author was facing, and that's what she chose to do to heal.  If you can get past that, it's actually a fun read.
B004ULNJIU|5.0|A serial killer targeting cops meets his match in Statham, whose acting here marks a strong inprovement over his previous work. There's still enough action for five or six movies, but the plotline is relevant too. Never slows down for a second, and is a must for any fan of Statham.
B004XE0P5E|4.0|As FOR EMMA FOREVER AGO has been on steady rotation the last couple years, I've awaited this release with some trepidation.  Would EMMA be a one off classic, or would Justin Vernon be able to deliver again on his sterling debut.  I have had the self-titled second album now a couple weeks and can say that he has delivered a solid follow up, but also that it does not reach the heights of it's predecessor.  That said, this is the type of release that unleashes its charms slowly.  While none of the songs floored me right off the bat, they have begun to burrow into my brain on repeated listening.  Vernon has not strayed too far from the sound of the debut, just expanded his sound slightly with additional musicians and a more full production.  If I had to choose between BON IVER or For EMMA, I would choose EMMA at this point, but I'm glad that I do not have to choose and can enjoy both releases.
1439102813|5.0|It's hard to believe that a book about the slow decent into Alzheimer's could be riveting, but this book is just that. Alice is the main character - diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's - and all I can say is that I rooted for her all the way through the book, clinging to hope, just as if she were a real person I cared about.     With just the use of words, the author has created a real family that I felt I've known all my life. They each have their own struggles, thoughts, ambitions and dashed dreams. But what really sets this novel apart is the ability to create such anticipation and dare I say - anxiety - for the reader. I didn't want to put the book down. I was so concerned about this family and about Alice that I wanted to know what would happen next.      I also have to praise the author for giving what I imagine to be an authentic portrayal of a person experiencing Alzheimer's as well as the experience of the family and friends who have to watch a loved one go through this terrible disease.    I haven't had a favorite book in a long time, but this just made my list.

It gives simple, straight forward advice, and gives a real life roadmap of how to go do it.

B004V6MWFU|4.0|Overall, I really enjoyed this.  I had heard him perform \\"You Belong To Me\\" years ago, also \\"Broken Heart\\" and I'd have bought this CD just for those 2 songs.  For the most part, these songs work with his voice and the ukulele. The only exception is \\"Dream A Little Dream\\", where he just never seems to find the right key.  Otherwise, just kick back and give a listen.  It's really good.
B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|I was reading a lot of the 1 star reviews and came to the conclusion that these people are all expecting life-changing music from Katy. That isn't what pop is. Its fun. Its here for a second and then its gone, but while it lasts, its awesome. Just like a sunset.... when you see the sun setting you think, wow this is so beautiful and magnificent and then after it sets, you go to bed and wake up the next morning having forgotten all about it. Does that mean that it wasn't a good experience while it lasted? No, it was breathtaking... but you know there is another sunset coming later on. Thats how pop is and thats what people are missing. Its FUN! The songs are one the charts for a few weeks and then are replaced by other pop songs. If you want depth and insight, listen to Dylan, or Brett Dennen or Derek Webb or Lauryn Hill, but if you just want to smile and sing loudly in your car... put in this record. Now, I have my Dylan days... all the time actually. I thrive on Dylan, but Katy is not, nor will she ever be him.... b/c she wasn't meant to be! She sings about stupid stuff but lyrics are NOT the point of pop music! EVERYTHING IN POP IS ABOUT MELODY!!! and this girl's melodies are KILLER!!!!!!
0316044695|1.0|So like many people purchasing this book, I thought I was going to get a story of an intense battle by elite US soldiers in the mountains of Afghanistan...    Instead, what I got was a nearly incoherent political rant that tarnished the reputation of The SEALs and showed me that Marcus may not have finished fourth grade. If he did, then He never took a writing class after that...    Marcus tells a story of heroism and horror, but he does so in a way that makes any reader who has ever read more than three books question his motives, ethics, intelligence and honesty. Yes, I said honesty because I could not help but doubt some of what Marcus said in his book. I was mad at myself for doing this because I have never served a day in the military and I wanted to respect Marcus (just as I still respect so much fallen Delta Operators Shugart and Gordon from Mark Bowden's brilliant Black Hawk Down), but I could not because I did not buy so much of what he was saying. There is no way on earth that while Marcus and his team were discussing the \\"liberal media\\" and how they would be part of headlines in newspapers if they killed goat herders. I flipped to the back of the book to find citations on this conversation (as superior authors and REPORTERS Bowden and Junger do) and shockingly, there were none. I'm sure as you were contemplating battling 200 battle hardened Taliban troops you were discussing the New York Times Marcus. Give me an effing break...    Additionally, A close friend of mine piloted F-14s in the no fly zone in Iraq in the mid 90s and here's something he never did: Talk about how awesome he was. All Marcus did is talk about how hard it was to become a SEAL and how awesome they are only one line above that he would say how SEALs don't do that. Well they don't Marcus. So why were you? You sounded like a Jersey Shore character and not a member of one of the most elite forces in the world (hey Marcus... Humblebrag much?!? Wikipedia that word)    I just don't get whatwas going on here and what the motivations were of Marcus. Was he in the Bush cabinet? Is he a secret Fox News analyst? This story just begged for a tremendous voice and Marcus wasn't it. For all this guy crushes the liberal media, at least those same media members are required to do research and take an oath to tell the truth. As I said above, Mark Bowden and. Sebastian Junger and also Stephen Ambrose all have told similar stories and they have told them WELL. And their \\"liberal\\" style is believable because it is devoid of the politics that Marcus claims are not part of his life and they are full of notes and citations and exhaustive research that makes the reader believe every single word they write. Their words don't fail them.    I appreciate what you did for the country Marcus, but as a book, Lone Survivor does no justice to you, your fallen comrades, and your special operations group you are so proud of.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Forced to give up his dreams of art school, Zach (Trevor Wright) spends his days working a dead end job and helping his needy sister care for her son. In his free time he surfs, draws and hangs out with his best friend, Gabe, who lives on the wealthy side of town. When Gabe's older brother, Shaun, (Brad Rowe) returns home, he is drawn to Zach's selflessness and talent. Zach falls in love with Shaun while struggling to reconcile his own desires with the needs of his family.<br />Zach seems to have his head together, has a pretty girlfriend he loves very much and adores his young nephew who has no other stability than Zach in his life. He is determined to make this kid's life enjoyable in spite of family neglect. Yet there is a part of Zach that is yet undefined and he has great difficulty coming to terms with, knowing it could jeopardize his relationship with his nephew Cody.<br />Trevor Wright does an INCREDIBLE job portraying his character. He was very well cast for the role. He is quite good looking which doesn't hurt, but acts the part with such tenderness and realism. A very professional actor for his age. I was enthrolled by his performance. The acting of Brad Rowe was also very good and the two make a believable couple in spite of an age difference. This is a very well written script and one almost any viewer can enjoy from beginning to end. I highly recommend the film. A solid five-star rating from this reviewer.

0684823454|5.0|Never considered bright, young Winston suffered his way though childhood with a stern governess and a prep-school that valued Latin, Greek and mathematics over the English that at an early age he had learned to love and excelled at. He considered himself lucky to find, appreciate and learn to write excellent sentences in English even though he did very poorly in the other subjects. This skill of being able to write good English sentences was to serve him well throughout his life, and is on exhibit in this book.<br /><br />His father consented to send him to military school as an alternative to becoming a lawyer, which he did not think Winston was intellectually up to. Winston had agreed to go along with this choice only because of the fun he had experienced playing daily with about 1500 toy soldiers he had accumulated over his childhood. After three failures of the entrance exam, he eventually entered the Sandhurst Military Academy. There, like his classmates, young Winston dreamt of glory in actual combat, and over the course of his military training got the opportunity to travel to Cuba and India before landing in South Africa (after receiving his commission) as a war correspondent just in time for the beginning of the Boer war.<br /><br />The highlights of the book are the details of how after being captured in the early days of the war, Second Lt. Churchill escaped imprisonment, and over the course of a month managed to make it across the border into what today is Mozambique. He arrived back in Durban, and later back in England to a hero's welcome, where his heroism immediately catapulted him into office as a PM at 26.<br /><br />The beautiful English of the book only serves to confirm that next to Arthur Koestler, Jean Paul Sartre and a handful of others, Churchill is without peers as a master of the English language. What a model for English writing. Five Stars

I was a fan of Susan's before I was Derek, only because I heard her first over the years before they were married. They come from different ends of the blues world but it matches up great! The music has such a soft touch to it but then it drives in it's on way for sure. All cuts are great but Bound For Glory really touches my spirit big time. Try this and you will be pleased for sure, even if you aren't a blues fan, I've been a blues fan since the 70's, you will become one, I bet, Yes Indeed!
B002ZG975Q|2.0|Beastly is an updated version of the old classic Beauty and the Beast, but this version didn't live up to the other movies.  Kyle/Hunter and Lindy characters weren't well developed in my opinion because they came across flat.  There were too many holes in the story plot such as why the relationship between Kyle/Hunter and his father is so strained, what happened to his mother, and what caused him to have such a \\"superior\\" attitude, not in a convencing way, about himself.  Lindy's relationship with her father wasn't fully explained in the movie, but the viewer can somewhat figure it out.  Other characters in the movie didn't really have a purpose such as Neil Patrick Harris's character as the \\"blind tutor\\" with amazing Darts skills(REALLY!!!), and Lisa Gay Hamilton's character, the Jamaican housekeeper(ok).  There was no resolution between Kyle and his father, and the ending of the movie...what the world....All I can say is I'm glad I didn't waste my gas nor alot of money going to the movies to watch Beastly.  I only wasted $4.99 and about 1hr 30 mins of my life which I'll never get back.
B003F3NDP8|5.0|Good DVD - the title speaks for itself.<br /><br />It keeps you in suspence from episode to episode.
B002ZG99G8|4.0|I tried watching last year's The A-Team and couldn't get past the first 30 minutes.    On the surface, The Losers looks similar to that in terms of characters and plot, but I had no problem sitting through the entire movie and having a ball of a time.    I love the cast, which includes Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana and Chris Evans.  Have been a fan of Morgan's since Grey's Anatomy, and always find him a compelling actor. Here, he oozes sex appeal and looks cool shooting machine guns in a suit. George Clooney, eat your heart out!    Saldana, who usually annoys me, is actually likeable as the mysterious Aisha. Her scenes with Morgan sizzle, and she handles the bazooka like a pro!    Evans, who will appear in the summer blockbuster, Captain America, is also a big surprise. I've only seen him in the Fantastic Four films, where he came across as bland and smart-alecky. As Jensen, however, it became clear why he won the coveted role of Captain America.  There's a scene where he sings and dances to Journey's Don't Stop Believing, which is hilarious! Who knew he had a talent for comedy? :)    A sorely underrated action comedy. I hope there's a sequel!
B003L77GGK|5.0|Because I'm a Baby Boomer. I started watching the show from the first season in 2005 when I was in my mid 40's, because I always enjoyed \\"cerebral horror\\". I was not disappointed. I too started collecting every season. I only collect series that I know I will watch over and over again. I collect this one and Criminal Minds, but I digress..    I haven't had an opportunity to watch this seasons, so I'm looking forward to having the DVD's so I can watch them at any time. I am a bit dissapointed that Sam is going \\"dark\\". I was always a Sam gal from the beginning. He was so sweet and shy when the show premiered. I understand as you grow older you gain confidence, but Sam should always have that little bit of kindness that makes him a great foil for Dean's bluster and overconfidence.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|I've been a fan of Matt Damon's work for 20 years now, since his early role in School Ties (1992).     The Adjustment Bureau really blew me away, probably because I wasn't expecting the direction the film would take, and the chemistry between Damon and Emily Blunt is absolutely magical.    It's unlikely to appeal to everyone - as the reviews clearly show - but I found the story riveting, with a balanced mix of romance, action and suspense. The cast is excellent, and George Nolfi deserves kudos for an impressive directorial debut.    The scene where Damon and Blunt's characters meet for the first time sent shivers up my spine. And those dance sequences actually do help propel the movie even further.     Will definitely watch this again and again.    4.5 stars! :)
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I had originally seen this DVD on PBS so I knew exactly what I was getting. I was enchanted with this DVD.  Having seen the original theater production, I feel this version contains all the highlights and then some.  It has proven a wonderful introduction to this kind of theater for my two grandsons, ages 12 and 9.  The segment at the end showing many of the original cast members is thrilling to watch.  The camaraderie and love shared is outstanding.
044024238X|5.0|Read the Shop series and loved it - read this book in 2 nights, loved every second of it, hopefully she will write a follow-up, would love to know what happens next!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|This series is great.  I was able to see some on British Broadcasting,  but they show too many reruns. And, since I can't find the all of the shows; I decided to buy the entire series.  This is so much better.  I have a waiting list in my family; so many want to borrow.
0312600844|1.0|If the President put it on his vacation reading list last year, I'm intrigued.  But oh my goodness, what a waste of my vacation reading time it turned out to be.  [And it took a couple vacations to get through it too, since I only read my Kindle versions when traveling; I had very little motivation to keep going on it once I was home.]      But seriously - the book is way too long.   Like that Saturday Night Live skit from years ago (\\"The Guests Who Would Not Leave\\"), this is The Book That Would Not End.  Franzen goes into painstaking - emphasis on the pain - detail about the life of a completely unlikely and insufferable woman.  Her never-let-me-go husband doesn't get much more sympathy from me.  And what's with the son who has to move next door so that he can screw the neighbor girl while they're teens?  Or bizarre exposes of a Haliburton-like company that leads directly to abuse of our armed forces?  The plot twists just get more twisted.        The obsession with birds and the environment is a quirky sub-topic that might have been interesting if it weren't dropped into this absurd tome.     So don't waste your dollars but especially your time on this over-hyped and under-written book.  Yuck.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|[[ASIN:B001DTPZNY Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]] certainly isn't the best Indiana Jones movie. That title probably goes to Raiders. Still, Crystal Skull is still a fun movie and certainly has much of the feel of the Indiana Jones series. Despite some risks and questionable choices, it works well overall. The relationship between Indy and his lost son, Mutt, is actually one of the better parts of the film. Mutt is a likable character who grows over the film. Unlike some of the other characters (more on that later) he actually brings quite a bit to the movie.     The plot works surprisingly well too. I initially thought it would be a cheesy aliens movie, but the alien presence is subtle. By and large, this is still Indy going into lost cities looking for treasure. I admit it's not the greatest MacGuffin and not my first choice, but given that choice Spielberg and Lucas used the idea well.  I suspect whether you like Crystal Skull or not depends upon your view of the Crystal Skull as the MacGuffin. If you hate it and can't accept it, then you won't like the film.    That said, the movie suffers from a few misguided choices. First, as others have noted, there are too many over-the-top situations. I know Indiana Jones isn't supposed to be realistic, but too often the characters would survive some impossible situation - the multiple waterfalls, driving onto a tree branch, and, of course, nuking the fridge - and I'd nearly roll my eyes. However, more than the particular scenarios is that by and large the characters faced these situations passively, by essentially \\"bracing for impact.\\"     Also, I didn't think bringing Marion (Karen Allen) back worked so well.  It got about 30 seconds worth of nostalgia, but otherwise she doesn't really do much. Sure she's there and drives the duck, but it feels like the movie barely reintroduces us to her before she's off marrying Indy. I suspect this is because the movie already has a lot of supporting characters, particularly Mac and Oxley, most of who are simply not that compelling. It's simply too many people to introduce into a film like this. Even in Last Crusade, with it's large ensemble, we had already met Brody and Salleh before and could empathize more with the characters.    Overall, I'm quite pleased that Spielberg and Lucas decided to make a 4th Indiana Jones movie. It's not the greatest of the bunch, but it certainly doesn't detract from the series. It's worth a try if you're an Indy fan.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Best game I have on my phone. Very well done and worth every penny. The only complaint I have is it occasionally forces my Samsung Fascinate to restart, but even that isn't enough to give it a bad rating.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|Outlander is the latest take on Beowulf in which Grendel is now a bloodthirsty space creature called a Moorwen.  The Moorwen is the last of its kind.  Its race was decimated by a rapacious people who, when they found the Moorwen planet, wanted it and took it.  The story begins with the last surviving Moorwen and the soldier Kainan aboard a ship that crash lands on earth during the iron age, in ancient Norway, land of the Vikings.  The Moorwen soon rampages through Viking villages, destroying everything in sight and leaving no bodies behind.     I found the story entertaining enough but not memorable - not on a scale as, say, Alien or Predator.   The acting is good.  You can't go wrong with John Hurt and Ron Perlman - in a role that suits him to a tee - sharing the screen with young action heroes Jim Caviezel, Jack Huston and the lovely Sophia Myles.  Creature design can make or break a movie in this genre regardless of the acting, and the Moorwen definitely makes it.  It's the fiercest, most nightmarish beast on screen on any planet.  Outlander was well worth the rental.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|Was buggy when I first got it, but Cisco released a new IOS for it and now it's solid.  Love the depth of the configuration parameters, makes for a very secure wireless environment.  Works well w/a Cisco SG-300-10 switch and a Cisco 861 WAN router acting as a DHCP server.  Love the range, throughput, and the lack of drops this WAP provides.  The InterWireless isolation is a fantastic function as well, keeping WAP clients from talking to each other.  Antenna diversity is solid as well and w/POE, a good solution for a large home.<br /><br />UPDATE - 8/1/2012:<br /><br />My original review was right after I patched the OS on this paper weight.  This thing is a complete pile of junk.  I've had 2 OS updates that supposedly will fix the constant dropped signal and neither of them fix the ultimate flaw of this product.  Cisco has basically written this thing off and will not help, nor fix this money pit of a WAP.  For $155.00 a piece, I'd expect far better performance from this than a $50 WAP/router, but if you think that is the case because this is a \\"Cisco\\" product, you are sorely mistaken.  I cannot keep a wireless signal broadcasting for more than 4 hours.  I've tried every recommendation from Cisco, had it replaced, and still, it's just a complete pile of junk.  STAY AWAY!!!
0143117009|5.0|I found the book well researched and well written.  A little slow at the beginning, but that is where the stage was set.  This book is quite scary.
0307477479|1.0|The book is simply too fragmented to be readable. Some chapters were interesting but the book reads like short storties  remotely tied together. Generally, I hated myself for wasting my time on this book.
B004UC1WN8|5.0|This is a REALLY great album. J.Lo is back in the game and she's got it baby. One of the best pop albums of the year, for sure. I loved every single track of it. My personal favorites are: On The Floor, I'm Into You, Good Hit, Run The World, Invading My Mind and Hypnotico
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book managed to be eery and spooky without being gruesome or horrifying.  It had elements of a psychological thriller but also romance, adventure, and at time dry humor.  It could be termed a \\"coming-of-age\\" story and portrays a teenager's identity struggles well.  The characters are fascinating and well-written, the descriptions really help the reader envision what each is like as well as how they look and talk.  I stayed up until the wee hours, getting the willies, and absolutely couldn't put it down.  It reminded me a little bit of Harry Potter, some elements of travel \\"between worlds\\" and mystical or supernatural beings from the viewpoint of a teenager with some pretty heavy baggage.  Very enjoyable and spooky without crossing the line into nightmarish horror.
B004Y03LQ2|5.0|As always, Maiden comes out with another great album.  Although it is a compilation album over the past 20 years, it is still a great album.  Personally, I would have chosen a couple of different songs for this one, but nevertheless, it is still a good set-list.  This particular album is meant for newcomers to the bands music and should give you a rounded out \\"view\\" of the bands music and how they have progressed through the years to where they are now.  For all of you out there who simply look at the cover and think \\"Satanic\\"....PLEEEEEASE!  Read some of the lyrics and you will find thoughtful and timely written songs with very melodic singing and great instrumental work.  As well, these gentlemen are much more than simply a heavy metal band.  Read their bio's and it is clear to see these are accomplished men in their own right aside from being in a rock band.  Up the Irons!!!
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Beyonce has done a great job once again.      She has produced a project straight from the heart with vocals sang straight from the soul and every this album is on repeat all!
B003EYVXUU|4.0|It's been years since I've seen a vampire movie that truly captivated me. Sure, \\"30 Days of Night\\" was cool and \\"Dracula 2000\\" was fun. But this film actually had characters I had cared about and a story that sucked me in (no pun).    My one gripe with this film is that it is one of those \\"whisper, whisper, BAM!!\\" movies. If you aren't watching this movie in an empty house or with everyone watching it, be prepared to constantly change the volume on your TV.    But the movie really justifies it.
B004G8QHKO|5.0|The first time I heard \\"Young Blood\\", I was hooked by this band. I then watched the video for \\"Girls Like You\\" and was officially in love. I don't buy every album that comes along but I had to get this one. If you love \\"Young Blood\\", you will not be disappointed by this album. It's absolutely beautiful, unique and one of those albums that you can listen to in its entirety. My very favorite track is still \\"Girls Like You\\", but with every listen of the album, I found myself liking other tracks like the 80s-ish \\"Eyes\\" and the splashy \\"Punching in a Dream\\" and \\"Spank.\\" I cannot wait for more and have been spreading the word about this awesome band to my family and friends. Can't wait to see them live in August!
B000096IBA|5.0|This is one of Chaplin's best movies!  The scene when Charlie is working at an assembly line is one of the most classic and most hilarious of all time.  It's a must see, not only for the humor, but also for its message of social criticism.  It questions what modernity contributes to the worker who has little time to do anything other than work in order to feed himself and his family - as opposed to what the worker does for the industrialist.  It's a clear criticism of Chaplin's time and the Great Depression era in the U.S.  However, with global competition at its highest in our day, the movie also has a message for us.  In either case, it is still a great comedy for young and old.  Great show.
B00005A0BC|5.0|this album is great.  if you are trying to get an otis redding album, don't get \\"dock of the bay\\" or anything other than this album.  the sad truth is though, that you probably won't read this before you buy a different album.
B0034G4P8K|3.0|From a visual and aural point of view, this is a great movie. The action scenes in this, the third movie in the franchise are as spectacular as ever. The special effects are breathtaking (the stunning scene where Decepticon Shockwave's driller cuts a Chicago skyscraper in two is almost worth the entry price alone), the robot violence manic and the various scenes where Transformers transform from earthly vehicles into their robot forms brilliant as ever. The makers of this film were clearly enjoying themselves. And Autobot leader Optimus Prime is a valiant character, perhaps the best character in the film. Where this film falls down, though, is the narrative, which just doesn't deliver. There is some obscure stuff about the Decepticons murdering Russian and American scientists to cover up their secret plans. Then the characters of the film - both human and Transformer - proceed to mumble their way through the plot. Not great. On top of this, the characterization of the human characters in this film is a bit lacking. Also main character Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has become rather annoying in this third film, and I preferred his love interest in the previous two films Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) to her replacement in this film Carly Spencer (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). Finally the humour in this film falls a bit flat, and the ending is poor.<br /><br />This could have been a very good sci-fi actioner. As it is, it is a missed opportunity.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Critics who offhandedly panned this film have lost their sense of wonder and awe at the art of special effects film making. I think they failed to loose themselves because they are jaded. Make no mistake, this movie is a wild, beautiful ride. Buckle up and enjoy.    The suggestion that it lacks substance is also false. It is merely the latest version of \\"A Hanging At Owl Creek Bridge\\" but with mind blowing and original special effects. In essence, the entire movie is about the lobotomy of young girl.    The criticism that the subject and the world depicted are depressing and bleak is dishearteningly shallow. Perhaps these people should only go see mainstream Hollywood schlock like \\"Twilight\\".    Making disparaging comparisons with video games also is baseless. So what if it reminded some people of a video game. I do not see that as a valid criticism. Video games can be quite moving and meaningful.    I found this movie to be engaging and beautiful. It was unfairly panned.
6305718954|5.0|Loved the acting & storyline in this movie.  Definitely a movie I can watch more than once & get something new out of it each time.  Really engages the mind & provokes thought on various religious aspects with out being preachy.
B0043ZDFEQ|4.0|I really like this album, but not 5 star worthy.    This is a fun album, cleaver lyrics, some really great songs, but a few of the songs have lyrics that make me cringe a bit when I hear them. Nothing truly horrible, but there are songs I won't be playing with young children around. The preview of the songs don't cover the parts that make me cringe. I am sure that children are not the intended audience but now you know so you can be better informed if this is something important to you.    Still very talented, and an artist I will likely be getting more of later
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Room is not only a novel about life, but about love, and determination to survive in any circumstance. I thought that this was a brilliantly written work, and being allowed into the mind of Jack rather than Ma or an onlooker is endearing. You not only find yourself remembering what it is to be 5 years old again, but you also are wrapped up in the innocence of a child. The simple ability to find pleasure in a situation when you know nothing more or less. The reader becomes a captive of Room, sharing in moments of laughter and of horror. Ma's love for Jack and her perseverance in keeping his life as fruitful and enjoyable as possible is moving. A fantastic novel that not only brings you closer to the characters in Room, but briefly reminds you to appreciate the smaller things in life. I simply could not stop reading.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|If you want to make a pretentious person frustrated, tell them that your favorite actor is Nic Cage.  It is very hard for people who care about what others think of them to enjoy a Nicoloas Cage movie mainly because Cage clearly is the opposite of them; it is obvious that the Oscar-winner really doesn't give a flying-flip what you or any other critic thinks.<br /><br />\\"Drive Angry\\" is the best movie I've seen so far in 2011 (I'm seeing \\"Tree of Life\\" tomorrow, maybe that will change).  On that point, it is the most entertained I've been at a theater since late 2007 when I watched \\"No Country for Old Men\\".  Now, if you're a moron that can only think in binary terms, you are probably thinking, \\"How can this guy compare those two?!\\" or, \\"How is this guy who enjoyed this piece of junk going to enjoy 'Tree of Life'\\".  Well, let me explain: my tastes are not defined by my pathetic need to be seen as \\"cultured\\" or \\"intelligent\\" by others.<br /><br />\\"Drive Angry\\" has everything good action movies should have.  Lots of explosions, car chases, terribly graphic violence, naked chicks, guns, guns, guns, and a satanic cult.  NO, I'm not comparing it to \\"Terminator 2\\", but alot of the leather-clad butt-rockiness of this movie gave off the same aura as that classic.  Also, the story is incredibly original, unless you can tell me about another movie where a dude escapes from hell to rescue his granddaughter from a satanic cult whilst dodging Satan's reconnaissance agent.  Cage is awesome just for being Cage, but I also enjoyed William Fichtner's role as The Accountant.<br /><br />Briefly, I also want to say how grateful I am that this movie is rated R.  Too many movies today are rated PG-13, thereby leaving out the bullets to heads, f-bombs, and gratuitous nudity that keep annoying families out of theaters.<br /><br />What I really don't understand is how so many people will drool all over Tarantino flick's that seek to emulate trashy cinema and then not enjoy the real deal.  Accept no substitue, \\"Drive Angry\\" is the real modern grindhouse flick.  It is a movie too busy being awesome to think, and it really doesn't care what your film school boyfriend thinks.<br /><br />Actually, I do understand why somebody would like a Tarantino rip off of trashy cinema but not like this; because this movie doesn't have Tarantino's name on it.  And people are so dumb that somebodies name being on something will immediately make them rate it higher than it really should be.  Did people actually enjoy \\"Inglorious Basterds\\"?  They wouldn't if it hadn't of had Tarantino's name on it.<br /><br />Drive Angry 4Lyfe!gry\\" is the real modern grindhouse flick.

1442337966|5.0|How to succeed without really trying, is what this programme really is.  I did not expect to recieve 5 CD's when I ordered this programme, what a great surprise that was. It is a great piece of work by Rhonda and her team. I found it very rewarding in the fact that all I had to do was change my thoughts and habits a bit. Not a great amount, but by working in with the Secret I find myself a happier person. It has helped me to take a different look on life and look at all the things I need to change.   I have found that a lot of the information given in \\"The Power\\" I was already aware of but had let it lapse over the last few years. Now things are starting to change.  For all of us who want to make great or small changes in our lives \\"The Power\\" is a way of making these changes happen.
0553582038|3.0|When I first began reading the A Song of Ice and Fire series I was surprised by the reviews on Amazon. The first three books are reviewed nearly perfectly, and the fourth is a strange departure from the rest. It's rated significantly lower. I later learned that this book featured a far different cast from the previous three, and immediately marked that as the reason for its poor reviews from GRRM fans.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's not accurate.<br /><br />I got through this book pretty painlessly. Martin is such a fantastic writer. His prose is both easy to read and flowery. His descriptions call forth an instant picture in your minds eye. And the strength and depth of his characters is known throughout the literary (and especially fantasy) world at this point. It really isn't a bad book, it's enjoyable. The single drawback of the entire book is that it is quite simply COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY. Long chapters of the novel go by in which nothing of grand importance happens. The entire book is just a gorgeous but fatty mess of side story. And this is the inherent weakness of the book. Very little of import to the overarching plot of the series actually happens, and the story arc of the book itself is incredibly weak and unfocused. The chapters that I found the most interesting (those involving the Martells of Dorne) disappear for almost an entire third of the novel, and the novel is not short. I truly believe that the majority of this book could have been cut out and we would have lost nothing other than some beautiful but pointless prose. I don't need to know (minor spoilers follow) every detail of Brienne travelling up the Kingsroad with two companions and the majority of Cersei's inner ramblings serve only to prove how paranoid and insane she is. The Ironmen's Kingsmoot was also far too lengthy for my tastes, despite my love of Victarion as a character. These are only minor points, but hopefully you understand what I'm trying to say. There are matters of import regarding Cersei's actions as Queen, Prince Doran's motivations, and a conflict at the end of the book. But these are not enough to carry the weight of a massive novel like A Feast For Crows.<br /><br />This is, overall, a book a beautiful words telling you of stunning, lovable, thought-provoking characters in which nothing ever actually happens. But if you liked the previous three, you'll have to read this.<br /><br />Let's hope that GRRM trims far more of the fat off of A Dance With Dragons.garding Cersei's actions as Queen, Prince Doran's motivations, and a conflict at the end of the book.

1611138434|5.0|I loved this book and have recommended it to many of my friends who have also liked it. What with the upcoming interview with Jaycee Dugard this book, with its very insightful descriptions of the mother's and the son's feelings, is very timely. I thought the two main characters were well developed and the contrasts in the mother's and the son's perspectives gave me much to think about.    I do a lot of driving in the car and the audio books are a godsend. I enjoyed the way this book was read. It added much to the story.
B004RQVVGU|3.0|This Concert offers nothing really new to the average listener, but it is a must to randy fans. You never get tired of listening to such a guitar god.<br /><br />The live set has a different feel than the live Tribute Cd, a different vibe.<br />As in the tribute cd, bass and drums sound lousy. The good: In some songs Randy plays slightly differenrt riffs and better executed solos, like in Paranoid.<br /><br />Randy's sound and articulation is better recorded on this set than on Tribute. The guitar is well in front so you can listen to randy quite clearly.<br /><br />Believer is indeed a bit slower and heavier sounding than the other versions.<br /><br />Five stars for randys playing, two stars for the bootleg sound.
0307946711|3.0|I was intrigued by the trailers for the upcoming film and picked this up for some light summer reading. The novel is entirely too long and the slow start almost made me give up a quarter of the way through. After the first hundred pages, Nicholls seems to settle more confidently into his characters' voices, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised -- mostly due to the sharp writing. The dialogue is quick and witty, and Nicholls has a talent for creating the most painful and hilarious awkward moments. Yes, the finale is contrived...but, were you really expecting anything different from a romance novel with a gimmick (albeit an interesting one) at its center? While many of the characters are not always likable, the way in which they're portrayed is refreshingly earnest. The revolving cast of minor characters are particularly colorful, ranging from laugh-out-loud funny (a girlfriend and fellow  TV presenter of Dexter's) to downright poignant (Mrs. Mayhew, a brief but startlingly strong presence in the novel). \\"One Day\\" isn't exactly poised to take its place among the ranks of literary giants, but its smart writing and ultimately touching - if a bit banal - love story still make for some fine beach reading. 3/5 stars.    (I'll be skipping the movie in theaters, but will almost definitely rent the DVD).
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|This was a super movie! A great combination of action with just enough comedy thrown in to lighten the mood at the perfect times. Always love anything Bruce Willis is in, but this movie was almost stolen by the rest of the leading cast members. Great plot, even one of the bad guys gets some cheers. Enough twists and turns to hold the viewers interest throughout. Highly recommended entertainment.
0312330537|5.0|It seems like overkill to say this is the best book you've ever read, but it is.  I loved every minute of it and can't wait to read it again in a couple years.  An absolutely amazing book!    100% recommended to anyone who enjoys reading.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great conclusion to the trilogy, although this was my least favorite of the 3 books. Still a great read and definitely recommended to the end.
0312323867|5.0|I discovered Emily Giffin a few summers ago, starting with Something Borrowed, then moving to Love the One You're With, Baby Proof, and then Heart of the Matter, reading all several times. I skipped Something Blue because Darcy drove me absolutely so crazy during Something Borrowed that I didn't think I could stand her for an entire book from her point of view. I put off the book for about eight or nine months until I finally caved and read the entire thing. Surprisingly, Emily Giffin makes Darcy likable through this book, to the point that you are actually rooting for her in the end, and of course, the ending is just perfect. I wouldn't say this would be my favorite of Emily's, but I'm definitely glad I caved and read it! It was much better than I expected, and completed the SoBo/SoBlue experience!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I have had the Garmin 405CX right at a month now. The first thing I did was change from the plastic straps to the velcro wrist strap. That was a little time consuming but it does come with all you need to change the wrist straps out. It just takes a little patience.  I will admit getting it set up to communicate with my PC using the ANT agent was a little stressfull. It honestly took me a good 4 days to get it working correctly. Customer service was helpful. One thing I did learn is that it works better when I sign in to my AOL browser rather than using Explorer. I am not a computer whiz but I am sure its something to do with the internet settings, which I tried adjusting per customer service instructions, to no avail, but with AOL browser it works great and no problems what so ever getting data transferred to Garmin Connect. So, if you get this unit and the ANT agent gives you a server error, try a different browser. After the technical issues, it was just a matter of playing with the watch and all of its features to get used to it. It does a ton of stuff, some of which I have not even tried out yet. Garmin Connect is really great. I am able to track and review all my runs and I can even look at other routes other people have run in my area that use Garmin connect and share publicly. I love being able to track my pace, heartrate and calories. It all works flawlessly now and I cant imagine running without it. The bezel takes a little bit to get used to, but its not a big deal and works great. I wish the backlight was button activated instead of bezel activated, because its best to lock the bezel while you run. I run a lot at night and its a hassle to unlock the bezel to turn on the back light. You dont have to lock the bezel, but it is sensitive and its easy to change the screen accidently while you are running. So I lock it. The GPS is amazing, it picks up really fast and I have never lost a signal to this point. I run downtown and I run in rural areas. I run whenits cloudy and raining with no problems at all. The heart rate monitor works really well. I dont have any issues with the comfort of it, I hardly notice its on anymore and sometimes forget to take it off when Im finished. The battery life is really good over all. I do have to make sure I remember to turn the GPS off after runs or it will drain it. I usually run it down to about 50% before I recharge it, which usually means I charge it about every 3 days, but it will depend on how often you use it of course. It charges pretty quickly. From 50% it takes about 1.5 hours to charge it fully. All in all I am extremely pleased with this unit, in fact I will be purchasing a second one here very soon for my wife.
1439107955|5.0|As a cancer survivor, former news reporter and novelist with a lifelong interest in medical issues, I found this Pulitzer Prize-winning book fascinating from start to finish. The author not only gives a history of cancer attitudes and research, along with case histories; he also animates his story with the personalities of the researchers and benefactors. I add this to a short list of truly brilliant popular medical histories in my library.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0043GX2IY Danger Music]]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was one of those books that you end up telling yourself 'just a few more pages, well maybe a few more'.  I finished the series in about a week and a half. I can't wait for the movie.

B004SUDPXW|5.0|There is a reason this show receives awards year after year.  It is the best show on TV bar none.  With every year and every episode, it just gets better and better.  The interplay between Walt and Jesse is fascinating.  The secondary cast is peerless.  You feel for each of them. You never know if you should feel sorry them or angry.  It changes from moment to moment.      If you liked the first two seasons, then hands down, you will love the third season.
B000002J03|5.0|It's impossible to say more about Led Zeppelin and this album than the other hard-core fans have already stated...I'll just say this is another great rock collection of Led Zeppelin's outstanding work. All the songs have the phenomenal guitar work of Jimmy Page. I believe the unique vocals of Robert Plant are unsurpassed. Both Page and Plant have vast artistic range.<br /><br />Okay, I'm a fan. Have been for over 40 years. Not too many bands can command this following, even to this day. Just look at the reviews. Led Zeppelin was, is, and apparently always will be one of the greats!<br /><br />Sure, there are some negative reviews...not everyone will like the same music. Me, I could write about bands and music I don't like but, I won't. I don't see the need to \\"dis\\" other people's passions. This is an artistic thing which is in the ear of the beholder. Since there are audio samples, just listen and make your decision vis-&agrave;-vis.
B001FBSMF8|3.0|Well, Chris has come a long way since playing the Off Ramp (now known as El Corazon, located near I-5). I actually dated a guy who worked with Chris when Chris was washing dishes at Julia's in Wallingford. That's kind of hilarious! My brother hung out with Alice in Chains and Nirvana before they got famous. The grunge movement was just weird because it was like the clothes we wore, the dark and depressing city we have here and its lonely inhabitants suddenly became famous. I'll never know why. It really is the guy next door with the band in his basement is suddenly famous and on a world tour. !!! It's hilarious.    I missed out on Chris' solo stuff after the first one, thinking, well he's not doing Soundgarden-esque music anymore, so forget it. But it's so interesting that he would go from a singer/songwriter acoustic guitar thing on his first album, then more of a bluesy thing on the second one, and now, this one is with Timbaland. It's a long way from Soundgarden, for sure. But if this is the music that makes him happy, I say go for it. It's just not for me. I'm more of a Soundgarden/Behemoth/Dimmu Borgir/Within Temptation type of chick. I like heavy metal, symphonies and opera. I would love to see Chris do what Michael Bolton did: an album of operatic arias! That was f-ing killer! Chris can still belt the notes.
B003V6L94Q|4.0|Got the CD for \\"Knee Deep\\".  Rest of the Cd was good too with good songwriting but OVERPRODUCED with too much arrangement!

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie is a must see for all Americans.  We are not educated about where our food comes, what is in our food and what is being done to our food.  In fact, Europeans know more about our food than we do.  Before I saw this movie, I honestly thought I was a healthy eater.  My motto was shop from the outside aisles in the grocery stores.  I had no idea that I was being 'corn fed' by eating what I thought was healthier choices.  My mind was blown away when I learned of all the products that contain corn; ketchup, mustard, mayo, fish and more.  The products that contain corn (and a ton of chemicals) are endless.  After watching the movie, I was so fired up that I was just learning where my food came from in my 30's I decided to write a health blog, I have given health talks to women and I have hosted several weight loss competitions.  Since I have seen the movie (and tried to stay away from corn-based products) I have lost 14 pounds (which is a lot for me) and I have seen others lose as well. I highly recommend this movie.  It ay change your life like it did mine.<br />-My Healthy Sushi (.com)
B004XE0P5E|5.0|To those who are searching for another \\"For Emma, Forever Ago. . .\\", you won't find it here, but you WILL find an album with a different sound and tone that has the kind of rare beauty and depth that have become Justin Vernon's signature. Don't give up on \\"Bon Iver\\" after your first listen- it gets better and better each time you hear it.
B0042FZWC0|4.0|I found the central theme of the book to be \\"live a better life\\". If you are not familiar with the author, you should check out his blog of the same name. I have read this book a few times, and continue to refer back to it. You won't be disappointed.
B002VL4OC6|5.0|Easy to grasp and understand from the artist's point of view. It is about the basic  building blocks that form the human shape. I have several other books by this author. Not your basic anatomy book this is based on line and shape.
B002L2GK0O|4.0|The material is top-notch...but this is not the type of book that should be read from the Kindle. If I could do it over again, I would have bought the paper copy. Highly recommended though.
0553386794|3.0|This book was very well-written and worth reading. However I was very disapointed with some of the things that were referenced and scenes that were very detailed having to do with sex, which is quite unnecessary. I personally do not think that these scenes needed to be in there, but for people it may be a plus. I wasn't overly impressed with the plot itself and for me it was really hard for me to stay focused. This took me a week and half to finish, but then you also have to understand I just read a 518 pg. book in a day and a half. If those scenes were not in there I'd give the book a better rating. The book is very well- written just not a book I would not go out and buy.
1594202710|4.0|Henry Kissinger has rendered a great service to any reader interested in the past 2 centuries of China's relations with the outside world....and to any reader wishing to gain insight into the dynamics of China's leaders as they cope with a growing, restive population.  Secretary Kissinger outlines areas of political and historic sensitivity and highlights the close but empirical working relationship China has had with the United States over the past 4 decades.  Challenges of the future are obvious; opportunites and options for mutual success are discussed.  The Unites States does not have to have a zero sum relationship with China.  This is must reading for any student of the history of China as well as investors and anyone interested in understanding world politics.
0439023521|4.0|The author tells story well. This story is told from the perspective of Kat, the main protagonist, is honest and well written. While the book is geared for youth or teen fiction, the audience is wide given the topic and Collins gift of writing. I appreciate sci/fi or fantasy fiction and this book works well in the genre. What I liked best about this book was the underlying commentary about Kat and Peeta and their plight about surviving the barbarism of the Hunger Games. I look forward to the next book in the series.
0307272702|5.0|This book deserves a 5 star rating for its practical wisdom that empowers the reader with information needed to address obesity, metabolic syndrome, and weight control.  Written in a straight-forward style Mr Taubes addresses the basis of our growing \\"epidemic\\" of obesity and the failures of \\"treatments and diets\\" based on counting calories and encouraging activity.  It appears the crux of our weight control difficulties are carbohydrates and insulin which together, using a very broad brush, regulate fat deposition.  The evidence supporting this conclusion is very strong, but not irrefutable. There may well be other significant issues yet to be understood...from genetics to physiology.  Nevertheless, this discussion provideds the basic information needed for a reader to begin to address weight control, obesity, and metabolic syndrome in a practical, constructive manner.  Traditional approaches to these problems have failed.    I can personally attest to the potential for success created by careful adherence to a low carbohydrate diet which by definition, then, is higher in protein and fat content.  My weight is at near ideal levels, my energy level is high, indices of \\"heart health\\" are favorable, and....despite being a type II diabetic for nearly 15 years....my hemoglobin A1C level is in the normal, non-diabetic range.    Please give yourself an opportunity to consider this option, review the evidence, and make your own decisions.  This could well be one of the most useful books you will ever encounter.
159448385X|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is a wonderful book for anyone wanting to know more about Afghanistan and the people living there.  Like \\"The Kite Runner\\" this book focuses on family life and the sometimes unbearable living conditions.  What is different about this book it that it focuses on the women in the family and what they must endure, very surreal for Western women to contemplate!  It is a \\"must read\\" in my opinion.
B000E0LB7C|5.0|Wouldn't it be nice if any reviewer of any product simply said, \\"I liked it!\\".  Well, I liked it!      I enjoyed them so. Backhaus does his best to give us the unadorned Beethoven.  And he succeeds so well that he has displaced Kempf as my \\"reference\\" set.  I have and enjoy many of the complete and near complete sets and a good many of other Beethoven sonata  recordindings.  But I now go back to Backhaus to hear what Beethoven really wanted.  And, in doing so , I continually rediscover the genius of the composer.  I think it takes a pretty good artist to assist you in that.    Highly recommended.  You will not be disappointed.
0143036556|5.0|Very detailed; almost to a fault. Good information though I don't see where he gets the jump from a few thousand years of South American civilization to saying they have been around for about 40,000 years.
0307266303|5.0|I can't recommend this highly enough.  It's a fascinating and quick read.  It's also really informative for runners.  I run barefoot and this provides all the information you need to justify it.
B002ZG98FU|1.0|Yesterday was NOT a good day for movies. Morning Glory bored the hell outta me. Harrison Ford was low grumbling pissed off anchor and Diane Keaton was in it just enough to know she was there. The story is predictable and not really very interesting.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was smart, funny and full of action. Atticus is a witty chameleon with very sharp teeth. He has managed to survive for 21 centuries and he really hates witches and The Celtic God of Love.<br /><br />Oberon, his Irish Wolfhound is fantastic. Hearne has given this character the innocence that counter acts Atticus' cynicism. Also Oberon's conversations with Atticus are some of the best dialog in the book.<br /><br />\\"She's kind of like a Mary Poppins just before she turns to the dark side of the Force. Let go of your anger, Malina! There's still good in you! The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully!\\"<br /><br />The story's pace is good and the action scenes well written. You could really see them play out visually. The story is a good start to a series and leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />One thing this geeky fangirl kept visualizing was what the heck the conversation between Atticus and Methos (from Highlander: The Series) would be like. There were a lot of times that I could not help but see some of the elements of Methos (snarky humor, beer lover, and survivalist) in Atticus. But I think I will probably be in the minority with that opinion.<br /><br />This was a great read, plus I got two short stories that take place prior to Hounded.
B003Y5H51K|4.0|I rather enjoyed Sanctum (despite the serious lack of monsters).    I keed, I keed.    Seriously, this is one gorgeously shot flick. From the very start the story is engaging and doesn't let up. There is some serious pain throughout the struggles of this team to get back.
B00006I53S|5.0|I am using my Canon 7D primarily for the HD video recording, and this 28-135mm lens came with the kit I purchased. It is great, from a videographer point of view, as a starter lens that provides great macro, fantastic portrait, and good telephoto capabilities. And since I usually shoot my subjects at about 7 to 15 feet away, this lens was perfect. (The full range of the lens is bigger than 7 to 15 feet, but inside of that range is \\"perfect\\" for shooting video with this lens.)    The lens has a heavy feel, and image stabilization, which is a must if you are going to be using a DSLR for video.
B0034G4ORC|2.0|Good lord, when will the hand held shaky cam go the hell away. My hate for this type of cinematography again triumphs enjoying any project that might otherwise be good. But Battle Los Angeles is not that good. It never delivers on the necessary money shots. You never really get a good look at the aliens or the alien ships. There is so much chaos going on with shaky cam and at such a distance, it just becomes a blur of activity. I've watched my son play video games and that's what this movie mostly emulates. I will give the props up for probably the most explosions ever in a flick, but I'm not sure I'd really recommend this movie.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I waited to upgrade for several months for this processor to be released, and boy am I glad I did. This processor is fast. I upgraded from one of the original Core 2 Duo's, the 2.4 GHz E6600, and the difference is impressive.

0345423496|5.0|Arthur C. Clarke managed to continue the story of Dave Bowman nearly 1000 years after he left off.  He also managed to do it it in such a way that a someone who had never heard of 2001 could pick up this book and understand it.  I first read this book in 1997 at the ripe old age of 12. Reading Clarke's work opened up a whole new world for me.  Clarke brought to me a love of reading and science that I  will hold onto for the rest of my life. He may of left us with questions, but Clarke never promised all the answers. He only promised to make you think.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I admit when I first heard Run The World I was not at all optimistic.  I just thought that she was about to make Sasha Fierce all over again and claim that as an album.  I should've known better.  Beyonce has come back on the scene in a major way with her new release 4. This is finally the album where she gets back to her roots of singing R&B tunes.  After all, she does have the chops to go toe to toe with anyone willing to challenge.  As with many artists, they always come around full circle to what made them famous in the first place.  From background singing in Silkk The Shocker videos to becoming a trendsetter and one of the most important artists of her time.    \\"4\\" brings the vocals back to the forefront and leaves the dance tunes in the rearview mirror (for the most part because you have to play the game to change the game).  The album carries more of a vibe or a groove.  It's not a high octane adrenaline rush like some of her albums in her younger years...it just....flows.  It's obvious that she could perform most of these songs for the rest of her career and not throw her back out trying to do the moves.  Love On Top is the crown jewel of the album and it sounds like she is having fun over this summertime feel good record.  The song is so organic in instrumentation, beautifully written and sung (sang?)....an instant classic.  She manages to find Andre 3000 on PARTY as he rarely shows up on anything nowadays.  It's another feel good groove perfect for a summer BBQ rather than a club type song.    I really can't praise this cd enough and could go through every song but just know that Beyonce has without a doubt delivered one of the best R&B albums of the year and arguably her best solo effort.  Her Pop/dance fans may be a little disappointed but they better get used to it because she is getting to the age where she'll be making more midtempos and ballads anyway.  I don't care how much radio plays songs from this album nor how much it sells because this is a superb effort on all levels; songwriting, instrumentation, vocals etc.  5 Stars.
1932907009|5.0|This is one of the best, basic screenwriting structure books ever! It breaks everything down for the beginning writer. As much as everyone likes to think that the actors just stand up there and make things up as they go along, movies need impeccable planning and scripting. This book entertains as it walks you through the process. Invaluable!
B004R10L4S|5.0|I always read the negative reviews first since I feel I get a better idea of what a movie like this is really about.  This isn't \\" The Bourne Identity\\" or a James bond flick, it's a story of something which really happened in the run up to the Iraq war.  Every aspect o f what's portrayed in this movie has already been proven as fact, wether or not you'd like to agree with it, it still portrays factual evidence.  We as citizens are the ones responsible for electing our representative officials. It's all of our responsibilitie to get the facts, and do the research before we pass judgment   on others.   This film make the point perfectly clear that many of us would rather sit in our easy chairs and let corporate media control our minds, and our wallets.  Injustice happens.....but injustice should not happen in an educated, and free society!
0316098329|4.0|The best way to describe my feelings about this book is by saying it was a story I did not want to continue reading but could not put down.  Read other reviews/editorial if you want more story detail.  I thought this book was very well done especially being as the narrator is a 5 year old boy.  The first part is fascinating - getting into the mind of a boy who only knows what his mother has taught him.  The mom does an incredible job of teaching this little boy about a world he has never seen.  The second half is very real, not a pat, living happily ever after ending.  But especially shows the vulnerability of the mom.  (I am trying not to give too much away).  How the story goes from part 1 to part 2 is a little farfetched, but the book is definitely worth reading.  Thought provoking and unique.
0307716511|4.0|This literary thriller, with its contemplation of sisterhood, family and self-discovery set in the context of a murder mystery was thoughtful and well-written.  The device of unfolding the story in the form of a letter from the living sister to the deceased one was well-executed and the writer's process of self-discovery, and the revelation of her character to the novel's reader as she told the story was particularly artfully executed.  The book with its London setting and English characters was very British indeed, which I also enjoyed.  Not a page-turning thriller or a masterful mystery, if that is what you are looking for, but the heroine's detecting process was well thought out and well-described, so that the \\"mystery\\" portion of the book holds up nicely as well.  I was interested and engaged, if not moved, but then again, I have never been a sister (at least in this life).
0545265355|5.0|First off, the books were absolutely amazing!!! It didn't take long for me to receive them and they arrived in perfect condition.
0345529057|2.0|The books are cheaply made. I'm on the very first read and already \\"Game of Thrones\\" and \\"Clash Of Kings\\" are falling apart. ON THE FIRST READ. I could'nt be more gentle when reading. I don't fold the pages back or chuck it across the room when I'm done. There's no reason why the pages should be falling out.     BEWARE, there is a reason why this boxset is so inexpensive. It's an amazing series, I regret not getting the hardcovers.
0321701763|5.0|This is a logical, well organized guide that provides a good foundation and extension of what you already may know.  The chapters are logical with simple practice opportunities. DVD was also helpful. (this was the manual that Apple recommended in their Photoshop workshop).
B0052U59F4|5.0|[[ASIN:B0052U59F4 Fifty Shades of Grey]]    I am rendered speechless, my mind reeling. I have read this story before, and yet I am still overwhelmed by the depth of emotion and staggering thoughts I have about this book. Having just read the last line, I sit here trying to wrap my mind around what I want to say, and my only coherent thought is....Wow! I am not new to this story. I have been a fan of Ms. James for quite some time now. I first read this story as Master of the Universe, a Twilight fanfic. I was one of the readers who eagerly anticipated each new chapter post, craving my next dose of our dear, beloved 50 like an addict craves that next fix. I was one of the readers cheering when we got the announcement that there would be book published, and crying as I read the last line of the conclusion. So why am I left in this state after reading Fifty Shades of Grey? I have only one answer - Ms. James has woven a tale so wrought with emotional undertones and characters that embed themselves in your heart that it is impossible to ever be truly prepared for the ride that this story takes you on, no matter how many times you read it. Master of the Universe fans want to know - Is it really the same story? My answer to you is - Yes, but it is also so much more. To those of you who are new to Ms. James and 50 Shades, I say to you - buckle up your seat belt and get read for the ride of your life! But be prepared, because you will not leave this story without experiencing a whole range of emotions and... 50 shades... of life, love, anguish, desire, and your darkest, wildest fantasies brought to light.    Fifty Shades of Grey is an erotic fiction about a troubled young man, Christian Grey, who has accomplished amazing things in his 27 years. He is every girl's dream - breathtakingly beautiful, sexy as all get out, successful, and rich beyond imagination. Anastasia Steele is every girl. She is just graduating from college and ready to embark on a new life. She isn't super model gorgeous, but she is beautiful in her own right. She is self conscious and insecure, but she's also smart, witty, sarcastic, and strong. It is easy for the reader to become Ana, because she could be any one of us. Ana is shocked that a man like Christian is interested in her. What she soon finds out is that having a relationship with Christian means allowing herself to be taken down a deliciously dark road. Can she meet his demands without losing herself in the process? Will he be able to give her the \\"more\\" that she needs?    I won't lie and say that 50 Shades of Grey is an easy book to read. You will feel every emotion and then some. Christian makes you swoon, he makes you angry, and he breaks your heart. One minute you want to slap his face, and the next minute you want to hold him and rock him. As a very strong-willed, independent girl, I had a difficult time reading parts of the story my first time through. Some of what I read turned my stomach and made me want to shout for Ana to run for the hills. But like Ana, I was drawn to Christian and could not stay away. The more I read, the harder I fell for Christian.     As emotional as the story is, Ms. James does a fantastic job of inserting humor throughout the book. Some of my favorite examples of this humor are Ana's subconscious and her inner goddess. Like the angel and devil on her shoulders, they are often at war over Ana's thoughts and decisions. One of my favorite goddess moments: \\"My inner goddess has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly...\\". Every girl needs an inner goddess like Ana's. Since reading 50 Shades, I have let my inner goddess out to play a bit more. Another of my favorite parts of the story are the e-mails between Ana and Christian. As someone who communicates best through writing, I totally get Ana's use of e-mail to honestly and openly share her thoughts and feelings with Christian. I loved watching the subject lines and signatures change through their conversations, and I adore the playful side of Christian that we see through some of his responses and the changes he makes to the subject lines and his signature line. Ms. James could have made many changes to the story in the publishing process, and I would have been fine (ok, maybe not fine, but I would have dealt with it). Had I lost the inner goddess and email conversations, however, I would have been very sad. I was childishly excited to find these two aspects of the story intact. In fact, MotU fans will be pleased with how much of the story is the same; somehow even better.    Fifty Shades of Grey is all-consuming, in the best possible way! From the very beginning, Ms. James' writing, her well-developed characters, and the story that she wove, drew me in and and would not let me go. I could not put this book down - I couldn't step away from it the first time I read it as MotU, and I wasn't any better this time around. Even though I know what comes next, the ending still left me in stunned tears. I am waiting on pins and needles for Fifty Shades Darker, the next installment of the story. Thank you Ms. James, for once again fueling my 50 Shades addiction.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I bought this CD on iTunes after going to every Target in my city and being told it was sold out. First let me say I'm not a huge Beyonce fan although out of all the young singers I believe she should be the most respected because she can and does actually sing. This CD is not for you if you looking for a club CD or something to party too, this CD is meant for those who are diverse in their musical taste and can appreciate a vocal not a autotune artist. I heard Beyonce say recently \\"I've earned the right to have creative control of my music and not just make radio songs\\". Also the purpose of this CD was to be diverse and showcase her vocal range, not for you to \\"bump in the car\\". Once again this CD isn't for you if you believe Britney Spears and Rihanna are the epitome of talent, but if you have a musical ear and respect a singer that can actually sing....this CD doesn't disappoint.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Starting out the view of a dog speakIng to me was quite weird to say the least.  But I started to really feel for him when his life started to change and a new person was taking over his spot and attention.  The author does a really good job of making the reader believe the feeling of him being true and real.  The outlook could most certainly be that of man's best friend.  It was a book that made me go through all my emotionals, laughing, crying, angry, disbelief, gratitude, and wonder!  You will not be disappointed in this read!  It is certainly one to experience purely for the writing style if anything.

For this reason, this was a frustrating reading experience for me.<br /><br />While I agree with Godin, we all need more \\"art\\" in our life -- I wish he had dug deeper in this book.<br /><br />I feel there are better books out there such as Drive by Daniel Pink, and [[ASIN:1463531915 reDESIGN: reCREATE: Reinvent Yourself and Thrive in the New Economy]] both deliver more on giving a concrete outline of creativity applied at work and in life.
0307272702|5.0|As a physician, I have read hundreds of studies on healthy eating, exercise, diet, weight reduction and obesity.  This book takes evidence from medical studies accumulated over decades and summarizes it into a logical, coherent, easy-to-understand book that will explain exactly why the low fat, low calorie diets proposed by dieticians and other \\"experts\\" in the healthcare community do not work and have lead to an epidemic of obesity in the U.S. over the past 30 years.  After reading this book, you will realize how easy it is to lose weight and keep it off without exercising for hours a day or living on a starvation diet.  If you are serious about losing weight and are willing to question the established ideas about diet and obesity, this is the book that will set you free from the cycle of failed diets and unsustainable eating patterns.

B0050CQY1W|2.0|I will probably stopping buying B's albums now because she's boring me to bits. Her albums now sound exactly the same and every time I get hope that Beyonce will bring something new to the table I become greatly disappointed.     Its frustrating because she is such an amazing talent but she never takes it to the next level. A perfect example of this was the song \\"Countdown\\"... she should've taken the song and run with it... she ran with it alright; she ran it into the ground. The hook on that song is so dope, but then you hear the actually song and I just SMH.     \\"Run the World\\" is probably her worst song ever. The only thing that could save that song was her 2011 Billboard Music Awards performance of that song.     The only two really distinguishable tracks are \\"Rather Die Young\\" and \\"Love on Top\\"; everything else on the album you've basically heard on all the other albums she had. And what was up with the album cover?? What is she wearing?? What is she doing?? I should've known this album was junk just by the cover.

0062060554|3.0|I finished this book in under 24 hours, and like the protagonist, I think most of what I read will not have left much of an impression on me.<br /><br />It was a quick read and I wasn't ever really bored of the story, but I also never really lost myself in the narrative either. A large chunk of the story is told through the main character's journals, but I wasn't really convinced by this storytelling device. The character had amnesia, and was (once) a novelist, but the journals just didn't read like true journals to me.<br /><br />And the ending wasn't a complete surprise, or something that you wouldn't have thought of as a possible scenario, so when it finally happened it just seemed kind of corny. Overall, not a bad way to spend a summer afternoon, but nothing I'll be convincing my friends to read, either.
0307477479|4.0|Two of my novels, \\"[[ASIN:1453748474 Bloomsday: The Bostoniad]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:1450564240 For the Beauty of the Earth: A Novel]],\\" competed against \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" for a Pulitzer in Letters this year and, naturally, I sought to understand what the Pulitzer Judges, led by Elizabeth Taylor of the Chicago Tribune, saw in this novel.<br /><br />Ultimately, I was impressed by the high level of stylistic invention of \\"Goon Squad\\" and loved the concept of embedding a PowerPoint inside the novel. (Look for Facebook threads in the narrative of next year's Pu winner.) Also I respected the unique voices of the characters and the narrative style in presenting their voices in dialogue.<br /><br />The story line is highly original and credible as well as satisfying in its denouement. I admired the interlocking destinies and the way in which Egan plays with the time sequencing in the plot structure. Having read all of Proust's novels, few novelists come close to dealing with Time as a theme better than Proust, Faulkner and Joyce. \\"Time is a goon\\" and a thug to whom we should not submit is good advice, of course, but did not strike me as a luminous epiphany.<br /><br />Because I must freely confess to the \\"endowment effect,\\" which means that I subjectively prefer my intellectual synthesis simply because it's mine, I have applied a more objective approach to rate the novel with an approach from my book \\"[[ASIN:1453687823 Novel Criticism: How to Critique Novels Like a Novelist]].\\" This book of literary theory applies to novels 25 \\"Critical Performance Indicators (CPIs)\\" against my reading of a novel to arrive at an overall rating of 1-5 stars. To be perfectly up-front, I also applied these CPIs subjectively -- but it's the best that I can do in good faith and every critic does the same.<br /><br />I didn't love all the characters and found the women universally round while the men seemed flatter figures -- Elizabeth Strout has a similar problem in her characters but women may tend to be more generous in assessing Egan's character portrayal of men and this is not easy to do. The novel transported me in several places but, at times, I found the literary devices created artifice which interrupted the flow of the execution of the art. Consequently, I didn't care about what happened to some of the characters.<br /><br />\\"Goon Squad\\" is certainly a worthy novel rife with literary innovation, which is, of course, very good for the genre of the novel.

1596680296|5.0|Well thought out, clear instructions.  There are exact patterns in here and also a selection of a la carte patterns for the leg.  A really great sock knitting book.  Tied with Schurch [[ASIN:1564775704 Sensational Knitted Socks]] for first place in my sock library!<br /><br />Now that I've had the book for a while, I keep coming back to it. The basic 7 sts/in recipe has worked very well for several yarns.  One minor kvetch would be that the size charts here and in Budd are without negative ease. Those are the actual foot measurements that correspond to the shoe size. If you want a sock that's a bit snugger and \\"fits like a glove\\", remeber to go down by about 10% of the overall foot length.

0783225482|5.0|Death Becomes Her was a pleasant surprise when I first saw it.  I'd never thought of Meryl Streep as a comedic actress, since I'd always seen her in drama.  The chemistry among the actors is perfection.  A good movie when you just want to relax and laugh.  Hysterical from start to finish!
0439023491|5.0|I am an avid book reader and this is the first series I'm actually taking the time to say how amazing they are! I never thought I'd get into books like this, but figured I'd jump on the bandwagon and give it a try... can't put them down!!
B0015AARJI|1.0|I ordered two of the Dualshock controllers through Amazon from a 3rd party seller.  The price and shipping time was very good, but I was extremely disappointed when I saw the controller.  It was clear as day that someone painted the name \\"Sony\\" onto a knockoff controller like you can get on Amazon or other websites for half the price.  I don't know if the seller was at fault because they could have purchased it not knowing, so I am not naming them here, but I hope that Amazon reviews their sellers and products for issues like this.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|Wow! I didn't know I was a fantasy fan until I read George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. Like many folks out there, I was turned on to the books after watching the premier episode of the HBO show. Fast forward a couple of months and I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for the July 12 release of A Dance with Dragons. Given the long hiatus between installments, I must say I am glad I didn't start reading this series back in '96.<br /><br />These books are written POV style and each book in the series - well actually each CHAPTER - ends with a cliffhanger that will make it impossible to put down. With certain character POVs you will be tempted to skip ahead to their next appearance. Don't.<br /><br />While the first three books in the series are universally considered amazing, the fourth installment, A Feast for Crows, has been given somewhat of a bad rap. I am here to tell you that as a fan of this series Feast is a must-read. You'll really get to know the characters better, and you'll be introduced to some new ones as well. Don't worry. You're still in George RR land and it IS still fascinating. It's packed full of the little anecdotes and side plots that make the series great. Reading this epic story is a once in a lifetime experience and you'll love every second of it. Even if George does decide to kick off before he finishes it.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Somehow, despite being an avid reader and a huge fan of crime fiction and mysteries, I've made it to age 30 without ever reading much Sherlock Holmes. Well, thanks to a free Kindle download of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, that's changed, and you can consider me hooked. That's not to say that Adventures is a flawless collection. Even with only twelve stories, there are a few motifs and themes - hidden identities, secret lives, disappearing people - that recur so often as to be distracting and make the cases a little repetitive, and Doyle's story structure tends to be rigid and unvarying. Holmes and Watson talk for a bit, the case is introduced and the facts laid out, Holmes disappears to investigate, and then everything is laid out at the end. At the same time, it's not hard to understand the appeal of the stories, even all these years later. Holmes is a fascinating, compelling character, and his relationship with Watson gives the stories a solid hook, to say nothing of letting the characters develop into something more than flat participants. And, of course, there's those wonderful deductions and investigations, where we watch Holmes explain it all in such a way that makes it seem so obvious, even though we could never see the things he sees. In a lot of ways, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a perfect starting point for a newcomer like me; in its 12 tales, it gives you a great introduction into the world of Holmes, gives you a sense of his logic and process, and whets your appetite to see what he can do when the cases are something bigger and grander. So is it any surprise that I'm jumping right into A Study in Scarlet (the first Holmes novel) after this?<br /><br />Note on the Kindle version: yes, almost any currency symbol or letter with an accent mark is turned into fractions and punctuation. Yes, it's a little distracting and irritating. No, it doesn't render the text unreadable. For the price...hey, it's a little irksome, but you get what you pay for..
B0014ECQ1W|5.0|what a fantastic movie about a person who shows perseverance and wins...He doesn't whine and cry and pity himself through out the movie. He just keeps going and trying against all odds. If he hadn't made it, he could say that at least gave it his all and that he came out learning something for the future to try somewhere else...This is an inspiring movie..a black man who made in the white man world and he never let on to any of them that he was struggling to make it in his personal life as in the professional world. He maintained a professional decorum through out and did whatever was requested of him.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|In which George R.R. Martin manages the impressive feat of building a massive world, establishing dozens of complex characters and their relationships, setting up a labyrinthine plot full of political machinations and complicated motivations, and does it all while managing a pace that keeps the reader absolutely hooked into his world. Martin has his work cut out here; the world of Westeros is a huge and complex one, and by starting his work essentially in medias res (that is, there is a vast amount of backstory that influences each of the characters), he only makes that more difficult. Add into that the choice to tell the story entirely through third-person limited perspectives (each chapter is confined to a single character's viewpoint, and the choices of character are limited), and you might wonder how Martin can manage to make this all work. The remarkable thing is, not only does he succeed, the book is absolutely masterful, juggling all of the difficult tasks in such a way that you quickly forget about them and simply immerse yourself in the tapestry Martin has made. There's lots to praise about Game of Thrones, but first and foremost, there are Martin's characters, all of whom defy easy characterization or simple description, but live and breathe all the more effectively for that choice. More than that, Martin brings a maturity and intelligence to his plotting, trusting his readers to be able to follow the various story threads and piece together the motivations even when they may not seem immediately clear. It's a mature and thoughtful take on the fantasy genre, which no doubt explains much of the appeal; in a genre that so often becomes synonymous with adolescent fantasies, it's a joy to find one with true depth and nuance. My only real regret is not waiting longer between my viewing of the first season of the outstanding HBO series before reading it; the adaptation is so faithful that it was hard sometimes to judge the book as its own entity. But I'll also say this: reading this has left me eager to see what else Martin has up his sleeve, and makes me question my decision to wait for the second season of the show.ay this: reading this has left me eager to see what else Martin has up his sleeve, and makes me question my decision to wait for the second season of the show.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Before I start this review, I have to say that I really didn't know what to expect from Sucker Punch. Mixing babes, WWI, Demon Samurai, Dragons, and Robota just makes a recipe for an epically awesome movie. The film takes young Babydoll who after accidentally murdering her sister is sent to a mental institution where she meets four other inmates, and soon realizes they're immersed into a world of dance and band together to escape. Using their dreams and the imagination, they must search for a map, fire, a knife and a key in order to escape from their ill reality. Soon, Babydoll bands together with Sweet Pea, Rocket, Blondie, and Amber to take an epic journey by using their dance routines to take a journey through the mind through four distinct worlds which include battling demon samurai, WWI demons, dragons and knights, and futuristic robots, all while coming up with a plan to escape from the clutches of Blue Jones....    Though I haven't watched the extended cut, the film kicks major ass...for anyone looking to buy it or thinking of buying it either on blu-ray or even dvd, do so immediately...it's that good.
0156027321|3.0|A friend recommended this book to me, in addition to noticing that it was listed as a   \\"top-500\\" must read in the area of modern fiction. At the beginning of the book the author seems to  imply that the story is supposedly non-fiction, but by the end of the book I felt unsure as to what to  believe.     Upon readng the first part of the book which described Pi's early life and his interest in religion and  animals, I held high hopes for the rest of the book. In particular, I felt intrigued by Pi's interest in   religion, and how he was able to follow three different faiths despite the protests of his parents and   priests. I thought surely the rest of the book would provide an avenue to further explore spirituality,  and better make sense of how one could consider himself an all-in-one Hindu, Muslim, and Christian.  And although the rest of the story did provide moments for Pi to reflect on God and the natural world,  I felt that this perspective seemed largely de-emphasized if not entirely absent. In other words, the   rest of the book seemed almost independent of Pi's multi-cultural spirituality. The rest of the book  focused more on Pi's survival, with lucid details of how he learned to survive at sea. Certainly Pi found   himself in a most unusual situation of survival at sea; but I felt that his unique situation was not enough   on its own to hold my interest. It almost seemed that the story itself needed more embellishment and the  author should have used more of his literary license to better tie together both parts of the book. But it  never happened for me.     The book left me with a feeling of emptiness and a sense that it did not seem   very well written. For example, early on Pi revealed how long he was drifting at sea before arriving  at Mexico. For me, knowing this gave away a secret of the story that did not need to be shared. In general  I would have preferred more chronological continuity for the latter half of the book.     The ending part seemedjust as disappointing. Leaving the end to nothng but sharing interview transcripts  again left me with the feeling that something seemed missing.    In the end, I give this book a slight recommendation (3.5 stars) because I did find some parts of his voyage interesting; especially his visit to the algae island.
B002T9H2LK|3.0|I only love this movie for Eli Roth and his Bear Jew shtik. Eli was right. Most movies portray Jewish men as religious or as nerdy weaklings. The role of Donny Donowitz portrayed a Jewish man as virile and a warrior.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I don't know why some people don't like this movie at all. I was excited just by the previews and got a lot of my 20-something friends together to go to the theater to watch it. We all loved it and then I bought it for my husband for his birthday. This is one I could watch over and over. Cute and comical.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I heard about this book in a best-of summer book review.  I really like the movie Memento and the premise sounded interesting: a journal with a note saying not to trust her husband.  I must say, I *never* guess plots when I read, but I had this one pegged pretty early on.  It was a quick, riveting read, but about 2/3s of the way through I had to start plodding through.  Sure enough, the ending was pretty predictable, to me, anyway.
B000SJJCX4|1.0|OK I need a tuner and I need one fast I ignored all of the review, it works great on guitar but if you use it on a bass it won't even read the Low B string I use Dr Red Devil Bass Strings and It won't read the Low B or The E at all in Chromatic Mode, Also I found that this tuner takes several seconds to start registering when using it on a bass, The LED is externally bright and hard to read what note your in, When I put the tuner in Bass mode it doesn't even tell you what note your in it only says the NUMBER of the string? YES thats right Only tells you what number and only tunes to standard.....But if you play a 5 string Bass DO NOT PURCHASE this because it just will not work, not with pitch harmonic, not by tuning from the 12 or the 24th fret NOTHING...I would send this thing back to Amazon if I hadn't have lost the box....Some say its worth 20 bucks...Honestly it isn't, I wouldn't even give this tuner to a beginner......
B004UHF51S|5.0|En dépit des soupes infâmes qui nous sont servies par bon nombre de radios, Michael Franks continue de nous offrir des albums de toute beauté. Malgré les années, sa voix reste instacte et enchanteresse. Vous l'avez compris, je demeure un inconditionnel de la première heure. Je l'ai écouté pour la première fois sur FIP dans le milieu des années 70, lorsque je résidais encore en région parisienne. Tout de suite j'avais été marqué par ce timbre de voix si particulier et ce rythme musical indolent si caractérististique de sa personnalité. La mélodie de ses compositions largement inspirée de la Bossa et du Jazz cool californien m'ont très rapidement influencé sur mes genres musicaux. Elles laissent transparaître une grande nostalgie et une certaine fragilité (au sens positif du terme).   Les albums de Michael ont traversé les dernières décennies et cetains plus que d'autres accèdent à une certaine perfection. Time Together est de ceux-là ; Rendez-vous in Rio était de la même trempe. La tendance Jazz de ce nouvel album est manifeste. Il s'est entouré de fidèles compagnons de route pour la réalisation de cet album, avec entre autre Chuck Loeb, Gil Goldstein, Mark Egan, Charles Blenzig, Scott Petito, Veronica Nunn, Billy Kilson, Mike Manieri, David Spinozza, Romero Lubambo, Till Brönner et Eric Marienthal. La prise de son est magnifique et les morceaux s'enchaînent avec un rare bonheur (et pourtant ma chaine ne fonctionne qu'avec une seule baffle, l'autre ayant été achevée par l'un des mes enfants).   Après plus de quatre écoute, je n'arrive toujours pas à les départager ; ils écoulent chacun leur mélodie magnifique et les musiciens laissent leurs instruments nous envouter.   Qu'attend-on pour proposer à ce chanteur musicien exceptionnel une invitation dans un des multlples festival de Jazz qui fleurissent tout au long de l'été en France (Jazz à Vienne, Jazz à Nice, Jazz à Juan) ?   Pour ma part, je ne peux que vous recommander l'écoute de ce CD à déguster bien au calme. Laissez-vous pénétrer par ces mélodies gorgées du soleil de l'été naissant. A consommer sans modération.

0811875040|2.0|Miette was one of several bakery recommendations from one of the best bakers in Portland, Oregon.  After discovering that all of the other bakery recommendations were excellent, and baking the wonderful Miette's Tomboy Cake recipe in Rose's Heavenly Cakes by Rose Levy Beranbaum, I excitedly pre-ordered Miette's cookbook.<br /><br />Near Great:  As other reviewers have written, this is a very pretty cookbook.  The author has a wonderful artistic eye that shows on the dust jacket, the end papers, the scalloped edges, the food presentation, and the colors in the book.  The photographs are beautiful, which is to be expected from Frankie Frankeny.  My only minor complaint is that one needs to turn the page to complete some recipes.  But this happens with most cookbooks.  For looks and layout, the book deserves almost 5 stars.<br /><br />Failure: With food, presentation is only one half of the equation.  The other half is taste.  And without well-written  recipes, presentation becomes either impossible or lost in the first bad tasting bite.  This is where the book fails due to extremely poor technical editing.<br /><br />First, the conversion from volume to weight is inconsistent.  I usually bake using weight.  If a book does not offer weights, I convert it myself.  However, this book does give measurements in both volume and weight. When making my first recipe, the Lemon Shortbread Cookies, I noticed that it called for 2 cups or 8 ounces (227g ) of flour.  Usually, if using unbleached all-purpose flour, the weight of 2 cups would be 280g.  But I went ahead with the recipe using 227g. The cookies tasted wonderful, but they spread and looked terrible.  I froze some of the dough and then baked the cookies, but they still spread.  Would this have happened if I had used 280g of flour?  I then went through the book and found that there were no consistent conversion factors for either the sugar or flour.  Either that, or the volume given in some recipes is incorrect.  ( Note: I did make two other recipes, Graham Crackers and the Yellow Cupcakes.  I assumed the volume was correct and used the following conversions: 1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour = 140 grams, 1 cup white (regular or superfine)sugar = 200 grams, and 1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar = 218 grams.  Appearance and taste were fine for both recipes.)<br /><br />Second, the specifications for ingredients are unclear.  After reading the essential ingredients, I assumed that all-purpose flour meant unbleached all-purpose flour.  Different flour types weigh different amounts.  This will affect the outcome.  Adjusting for weight differentials, I had luck with Guisto's Cake and Pastry Flour even though the author says \\"cake and pastry flours are flavorless and have no character.\\"  It could be a matter of tastebuds.  And, what does \\"no character\\" mean?  Meg Ray recommends organic sugar but says it can be replaced with refined sugar but never clarifies if the volume or weight need to be adjusted.  I  have used both granulated sugar and superfine sugar and both have worked, but was I lucky?  Was curious why Meg Ray just did not grind her organic sugar instead of \\"calibrating\\" recipes to accommodate the larger crystals.<br /><br />Third, the directions are poor.  When making the Lemon Shortbread Cookies, the directions stated to roll dough to ½-inch thick 6-by 4-inch rectangle and cut into forty-eight 1-inch squares. This is illogical.  Also, when made according to the recipe, the dough actually makes a 1-inch thick 6-by 4-inch rectangle.  Since I have baked these cookies, an errata page has partially corrected this problem by saying the recipe makes 24 cookies.  But then, the directions should read 1- inch thick 6-by-4- inch rectangle.  Or maybe, it should be ½ inch thick by 12-by-4- inch rectangle and cut into forty-eight 1-inch cookies!  Who knows.  Other reviewers have noted other direction discrepancies that have now been noted on the errata page.  Are there other directionmistakes?<br /><br />I bake a lot and use many cookbooks, and this is the first time I have had to deal with so many inconsistencies.  Other bakeries have excellent baking books, e.g., Flour, by J. Chang, especially the brioche and oatmeal raisin cookies, and Tartine by E. Prueitt especially the croissant and galette, and neither have this many problems.<br /><br />My recommendation to the author: Get two non-Miette bakers (and that means non-Miette students, too) to test each recipe.  One should test the volume and directions and the other should test the weights and directions. And then get a good subject matter editor for the next edition.<br /><br />My recommendations to the cookbook buyer:  If you want a coffee table cookbook, buy this book.  If you want a cookbook for baking, wait for a later edition.<br /><br />***<br /><br />PS:  Took out the links to other books, because I discovered, and was disappointed, that some \\"reviewers\\" are compensated for purchases made through these links.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Update 26 Jul 2011<br /><br />The updated errata page contains errors.<br /><br />The buttercream directions now have a conflict between 238 degrees in Step 3 and 248 degrees in Step 1.  And, the caramel recipe does not mention how much of the fleur de sel to use.  The number of cookies for lemon shortbread does not make any sense unless the dough is rolled to a 6\\"x7\\" rectangle.  The number of large chocolate chip cookies is incorrect. One cannot make thirty-six 3-inch cookies by rolling \\"... the dough into 2-inch balls.\\"  At least, the weights for flour and sugar have now been corrected.  But, are there any more errors not listed?  Yes, there are.  The number of chocolate sables should be forty-two, not thirty-six cookies.  The weight for oats in the chocolate chip cookie is incorrect.  Extremely disappointed.<br /><br />On a good note, the thumbprint cookies are good with a delicate taste.  I served them with and without the jam.  Using about 15 grams of dough per cookie, it made a total of thirty-six 1 3/4-inch cookies.  But, the chocolate chip cookies (111 cookies of 12g dough) tasted like generic brand store cookies.

0307946711|5.0|I just loved this book -- very unique premise. Two college students hook up one night and spend the next day together and then the rest of the book is what happens on that one day each year later. Sounds weird but it really works. I loved the characters of Emma and Dexter, not to mention all the secondary characters. The book is funny but also very sad. Just one of those books you lose yourself in and enjoy.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I loved this book!  Ms.Harrison has created a world full of captivating characters complete with witty banter, hot manflesh, and hot sex.  I have already pre-ordered the next two books in this series.  Kresley Cole is my #1 favorite for this genre, and Thea Harrison has become a close second now that J.R.Ward's BDB series has fizzled out.  I was invested in Dragos and Pia just from the Kindle sample and stayed up into the wee hours last night to finish it.      I was a little concerned when I started reading that Pia was vegan (do vegans eat Twizzlers and cherry coke slurpees? That's a lot of artificial food coloring).   After reading Dianne Duvall's \\"Darkness Dawns\\" POS I wanted to eat a medium rare filet mignon while punching Ms.Duvall in the throat (repeatedly).  However, Ms.Harrison didn't go overboard and without giving any spoilers, it made sense for the book.  AND, Dragos stayed true to his carnivorous nature throughout the book.  Praise the gods! I don't need another zealot ranting about the health benefits of eating organic/vegan.   I like the men in my romance books to be MEN, not tofu ice cream-eating, Birkenstock-wearing vegans.  If that's what I wanted to fantasize about, I'd spend my Friday nights at the Whole Foods store after dragging myself away from sewing my own clothes out of hemp for the next PETA rally.     Thank you Ms.Harrison. You kick ass!
B004H1YH66|5.0|I'm a longtime fan of Conan The Barbarian. I thought the original soundtrack was great, but in my opinion, this version is even better.  The fact that the effort was made to totally redo a soundtrack from 30 years ago shows just how awesome it was.  Some purists would say this or that sound was different from the original, but the quality of sound and expanded soundtrack more than does it for me.  If you are a fan or even if you just like this kind of music, this is one to have.  I hope the new Conan movie will have the same power and magnitude as this.  I give this 5 Stars!
0380730405|5.0|I have been procrastinating in reading this novel. I'm glad I finally read it. I understand now why this novel is highly recommended and popular to other readers. Daphe du Maurier was gifted in writing and in mixing more than one genre in this story. It has a mix of romance, suspense, thriller, and mystery. The ending was unexpected and quite a surprise to me. I will never forget this story.

B0006Z2KYI|5.0|\\"To Be Or Not To Be\\" is a one of a small group of anti-Nazi films that came out prior to the U.S. entry into WW 2. Most of these films were serious films  - e.g., \\"Confessions of a Nazi Spy\\" (1939), \\"All Through the Night\\" (1941), \\"Night Train to Munich\\" (1940) , \\"The Mortal Storm\\" (1940), \\"49th Parallel\\" (1941), \\"Waterloo Bridge\\" (1940), and \\"A Yank in the RAF\\" (1941) - but two were comedies: this one and Chaplin's \\"The Great Dictator\\" (1940). And if I can be forgiven for the sin, I think this one was the best.<br /><br />The film stars Jack Benny and Carol Lombard as Polish actors who get involved in political intrigue when the Nazis invade Poland.<br /><br />Jack Benny (1894-1974) was one of the funniest comedians who conquered vaudeville, radio, film, and TV. His film career was the least of his considerable achievements with only a handful of memorable films, the best of which were this film and \\"The Horn Blows at Midnight\\" (1945).<br /><br />Carole Lombard (1908-1942) was one of the best comediennes of the mid 20th century, her talented life cut short at 33 during a USO tour. She appeared in \\"Twentieth Century\\" (1934), \\"Bolero\\" (1934)and \\"My Man Godfrey\\" (1936) for which she received an Oscar nomination. She was the Queen of screwball comedies. This was her last film and she died before it was released.<br /><br />FWIW - Lombard's husband Clark Gable urged her not to make this film, but she did, and afterwards said it was the happiest experience of her movie life.<br /><br />Handsome Robert Stack (1919-2003) plays a Polish bombardier who is infatuated with Lombard. He is best known from his Emmy winning performance in the TV series \\"The Untouchables\\" (1959-63), but he made dozens of films including \\"The Mortal Storm\\" (1940) which was one of the best pre war anti-Nazi films. Shortly after he made this film Stack enlisted in the Navy. He was nominated for an Oscar for \\"Written on the Wind\\" (1957).<br /><br />FWIW - Stack played dramatic, some might say melodramatic roles for most of his life, then with \\"Airplane\\" (1980) he moved into comedy, but you can see the roots of his considerable comedic skills in this film.<br /><br />In addition to Benny, Lombard, and Stack, the cast includes Lionel Atwill, Charles Halton, and Sig Ruman.<br /><br />Lionel Atwill (1885-1946) was the king of the B horror films and best remembered as Inspector Krogh, the man with the wooden arm, who hunts down the monster in \\"Son of Frankenstein\\" (1939) while managing to get in a game of darts with Basil Rathbone.  Atwill appeared in 5 of the 8 Universal Frankenstein films, and also had time for \\"Mark of the Vampire\\" (1935) and \\"House of Dracula\\" (1945) as well as several Sherlock Holmes films, the best of which was \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" (1939). He plays a pompous actor.<br /><br />Charles Halton (1878-1959) almost always played a weasly character that fit his small frame and sharp features. He appeared in more than 150 films between 1917 and 1958, often in comedies like \\"The Shop Around the Corner\\" (1940), but he could also play the villain.<br /><br />Fat and funny Sig Ruman (1884-1967) was everyone's favorite German, best known as Sgt. Schulz from \\"Stalag 17\\" (1953) and opera owner Hermann Gottlieb in \\"A Night at the Opera\\" (1935). He plays a German Colonel in charge of Warsaw.<br /><br />Ernst Lubitsch (1892-1947) directs. He began his career in the silent era. He was nominated for an Oscar 3 times, including \\"Heaven can Wait\\" (1943). Lubitsch was a master of comedy, and a favorite of directors like Billy Wilder and William Wyler. He liked to say \\"Nobody should try to play comedy unless they have a circus going on inside.\\"<br /><br />Cinematographer Rudolph Mate (1898-1964) was Oscar nominated 5 years in a row, from 1940 (\\"Foreign Correspondent\\") to 1944 (\\"Cover Girl\\"). He turned to directing in 1947 and made films like \\"Union Station\\" (1950), \\"When Worlds Collide\\" (1951), and \\"The 300 Spartans\\" (1962).<br /><br />The film was not wellreceived when released. Benny's own father walked off when he saw his son wearing a Nazi uniform.<br /><br />This is one of the funniest films of all time, and made even more important due to its poignancy. The acting is terrific, the dialogue is hysterical, and the sight gags are funny even more than a half century later. Don't even bother with Mel Brook's remake.received when released.

B004WJREMW|4.0|In the fall of 1969, Paul McCartney anticipated the dissolution of the Beatles by recording a number of demos at his home studio, overdubbing all the instruments and vocals (except for some harmony vocal by wife Linda). The resulting tracks came out well enough to be issued as an (experimental) solo album, McCartney. Ten years later, in the summer of 1979, McCartney was contemplating the possible dissolution of Wings, and again recorded all the instruments and vocals (plus Linda's vocals) at his home studio, this time experimenting with various synthesizers. Again, he was sufficiently pleased with the results, the album was released in early 1980 as McCartney II. (Wings didn't release another album, but didn't actually disband for another year).    Critical reaction to McCartney II, similar to the McCartney album, was mostly good but relatively mixed, with some considering the album slightly lightweight and others lauding the \\"experimental\\" electronic nature of the album.     Overall, the album comes off very relaxed, very similar in mood to the McCartney album. The leadoff track, \\"Coming Up\\", peaked at #2 on the UK singles chart, while a live version of the same song topped the US chart. The song is among McCartney's most optimistic ever, with a great melody and dance rhythm. The studio version included on the album sounds thinner and dated compared to the more muscular live version thanks to some thin sounding synthesizers and McCartney's falsetto vocals. \\"Temporary Secretary\\" is a techno-dance number which is simultaneously very catchy and (almost) annoyingly repetitive and thin; \\"On the Way\\" - a uniquely optimistic light-blues and nice complement to \\"Coming Up\\"; \\"Waterfalls\\" - a very touching, slow-moving ballad to his son (which unfortunately carries on slightly too long); and \\"Nobody Knows\\" is a very fun bouncing rocker. Side 1 is very enjoyable and a suitable follow-up to the McCartney album.    The first three tracks of Side 2 show that McCartney was quite capable of coaxing some fine, robust sounds from his synths, as \\"Front Parlour\\" is just a cool instrumental, \\"Summer's Day Song\\" - a simple lullaby; and \\"Frozen Jap\\" - an enjoyable oriental march. \\"Bogey Music\\" is an uptempo swing rocker that is every bit as odd, and fun, and the title suggests; \\"Darkroom\\" is slightly naughty in a highly domestic way; and \\"One of These Days\\", a \\"Yesterday\\"-style acoustic ballad, ends the album with an optimistic wishfulness.     The bonus disc contains the live version of \\"Coming Up\\", the non-album single \\"Wonderful Christmastime\\", and leads-off with a cool, previously unreleased, instrumental called \\"Blue Sway\\". The rest of the bonus disc isn't quite as enjoyable. \\"Check My Machine\\" begins with some Looney Tunes dialogue which segues into a sort of synthesized banjo rhythm accompanied by McCartney's heavily echoed shouts of \\"check my machine\\" - very cute for about 60 seconds, then fairly monotonous. Similarly, the slow synth workout on \\"Secret Friend\\" is nice for a couple of minutes, but gets dull well before the 10:31 end mark. \\"Bogey Wobble\\", \\"Mr. H Atom\\", and \\"All You Horseriders\\" are pretty much disposable (if not annoying). The track sequencing of the bonus disc is bewildering.    The packaging is superb with lyrics, credits, and nice pics.     Overall, similar to the McCartney album, a very enjoyable album and well worth the price of a single CD.

B005A1ER0I|5.0|I've been a fan of trailer music for a long time and enjoyed Thomas's work in Two Steps from Hell as well as that of  similar artists such as The Immediate. This is my favorite album of the Epic Music genre. Thomas works in a lot of different emotions  and character in these songs, and with nineteen songs, there's something for everyone.    Musically speaking, what stands out in Illusions is the use of fantastic female vocalists that will send a shiver down your spine. Latin-type choirs are here, as well, but more judiciously applied than in some of the other trailer-type music that tends to overdo it. Thomas employs  pulsing strings, heroic horns, and driving beats, and he uses these to create story-scapes in your mind.    Stand out tracks: Starvation (feels like you're in a mine with scrawny slave children), Ocean Princess (standing on a cliff watching a mighty, rescuing ship pull into view), Homecoming (you've died and gone to heaven. Chills every time. Great medicine for a bad mood), Immortal (a warrior cleaning up on the battlefield) and Age of Gods (Heroes facing down the hordes. The mirroring of the horn and latin choir at the beginning are chill inducing).    There are no bad tracks on the album. Even the ones with a softer touch (Remember Me and Hurt) are a fun listen. Nine bucks is a ridiculously low amount to pay for this much quality music, so enjoy.
B000IVW25M|5.0|How can anyone not love this movie. It's probably the best Disney movie ever!  I recomend this to any family
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|These guys are classic! There is no describing them. They aren't Spinal Tap. They aren't Motley Crue. They aren't Van Halen. They are Steel Panther. Las Vegas perfomers who are EXTREMELY talented at what they do...parodies of the now-almost-defunct Hair Metal of the 80's. Their talent, as far as musicianship goes, is top-notch. These guys can bring it. And their lyrics, while being crass and over-the-top, are relentlessly hilarious. Here are some samples:<br /><br />The pseudo-love song \\"Community Property\\" starts out with \\"I would give you the stars, but they're too far away.\\" Ha Ha Ha!<br />That line is followed up with \\"If suddenly you were a guy, I'd be suddenly gay.\\" Ha Ha Ha! Classic!<br />And all the while, some sweet, 12-String Acoustic Guitar \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\" style music is playing.<br /><br />Or how about \\"Fat Girl\\"?<br />\\"I know you're hungry<br />I can see it in your eyes<br />'Cuz you're looking at me<br />Like I'm a side of fries\\"<br /><br />Freakin' hilarious. And the music is straight jammin'! Exceptional solos, excellent vocals, thundering drums. These guys are the real deal gone funny!<br /><br />If you can get past the seriousness of life and understand what these guys are trying to do, you'll be pleased beyond contentment.<br /><br />Being an old 80's guitarist from the 70's and 80's, I can tell you that these guys may have inspired me to start up my own parody band!<br /><br />GO STEEL PANTHER!
0061186473|4.0|Every time I start a new book I do so with a certain level of excitement because I figure there's a chance it's going to be really really good. Every time I start a book by Neil Gaiman, the excitement level is significantly higher because I KNOW it's going to be really really good.<br /><br />Gaiman first came on the scene with his very popular Sandman graphic novels series, which have been credited for redefining the comic book genre. Since then he's written children's books (which my kids have enjoyed a lot), novels, short stories, and most recently an episode of Dr. Who. His most mainstream success came with his Young Adult novel Coraline which Tim Burton made into a movie.<br /><br />The first book of his I read was Neverwhere and I absolutely loved it. I've since read all his other books and none of them have been disappointments.<br /><br />M is for Magic is a collection of some of his short stories and is described as \\"for Young Adults.\\" However, I would recommend that parents read them first before passing them along to their children. My oldest daughter is 12, and I think she needs to be a few years older before reading a couple of the stories. They're not offensive or profane, but the subject matter in some of them is a little more mature than I'm comfortable with her reading right now.<br /><br />The stories are all classic Gaiman, which means they're extremely creative, a little warped, and a lot of fun to read. I think he's probably one of the most consistent writers alive today in terms of the quality of his writing and he seems to be able to accomplish it effortlessly.
0375507256|5.0|What a reading experience - I knew as I was reading it that this was a book I would need to read again in order to absorb everything between the covers. I purchased this book after first reading the author's latest novel The Thousand Autumns of Jacob DeZoet
B0015DWJX2|5.0|The reading of this book remains one of my most enjoyable book experiences! The book moved quickly with humor and interrest. It is set in a corner of history which was new to me. One word of warning, the story is told through a sequence of letters, a format I enjoyed, but i know some people refuse to read letter books. if you skip this book on those grounds you`ll be missing out.
B00479SVBU|4.0|I bought this for a car with a factory CD stereo and I didn't want to replace it with a new stereo. That's something I did with my old car, which worked great, but I had to always take the faceplate around with me, which was a pain.    This is a good product that does exactly what it says it does for my iPod Touch.
1594744769|5.0|Ransom Riggs definitely has a winner on his hands! I must admit that I was drawn to this book for the vintage photographs.  I collect vintage and antique photographs and was intrigued with the idea of a story built around a set of old photo's. The photographs used in the book have been unaltered.  When you see the pictures, you may question this, but I own several weird, old pictures that makes you wonder how the photographer took the picture. The story was developed around a set of strange photographs.  I originally thought the book might be creepy and horrific, which is not a genre I usually read.  But, I decided to read it anyway, and I am glad that I did.  The book was neither creepy or Horrofic. I would describe it as a historic Sci Fi genre.The story begins with Grandfather Portman telling his grandson, Jacob stories about his childhood.  The stories were strange and unbelievable by almost everyone.  However, Jacob had a special bond with his Grandfather, and believed his stories for many years.  When the grandfather is dying, he tells Jacob to go to his childhood home and warn them that the monsters were coming for them.  Jacob thought maybe his Grandfather had really lost it, but he went to his Grandfather's homeland anyway.  He decided he needed to go and just see what he could find.  Once there, Jacob is faced with his grandfather's monsters and a whole lot more.  He is on the adventure of his life and he can't discuss it with anyone for fear they will think he is crazy.  His adventure involves time travel, romance, mystery, History and Monsters!  I truly loved this story and couldn't put it down.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I absolutely love my Logitech G930.  It was a huge upgrade from the Logitech Clear Chat Style that I had before.  The sound quality is a amazing, and the 7.1 surround is awesome.  You can definitely hear the foot steps around you in your games.  The range on this headset is great, I can go downstairs to the kitchen, garage, and even outside, and still have the same quality of sound on both microphone, and speakers.  The batter life is good, but I like that you have the ability to use the headset while it's plugged in, and the charging cable from the USB extension is long enough to comfortable accommodate being plugged in.

If you like musicals with great dancing and music, do not walk, but RUN to watch this marvelous movie.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I haven't had so much fun watching a movie in years. Matthew Vaughn's very clever \\"Kick-Ass\\" has probably everything anyone would want in an action film: Comedy, Action, Love, really nefarious bad guys, Dumb moves, intrigue... everything! I couldn't possibly add anything, since it's all been said, but director Vaughn kept everything paced and centered, Aaron Johnson was endearing, Mark Strong is the meanest of bad guys, Christopher Mintz-Plass&eacute; showed that he can play more than McLovin, and Nicholas Cage was there, briefly, to keep some focus to the terrific subplot, and all involved were totally buying in to the insanity. Enough can't be said about the magnificent Chlo&eacute; Grace Moretz, an intuitive young actress who is a total natural, best in the film. This review may not be read, but I'm compelled to get in my 5-stars.
B002ZG98VE|3.0|I hadn't heard anything good about this movie, but my husband wanted to see it so I ordered it from Amazon.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!  We both thoroughly enjoyed it!  Good performances all round, and an interesting and different perspective on the tale of Robin Hood.
B004NROYUI|4.0|I love my X100.  Best camera I've ever owned that gives me a desire to take photographs.  The look and feel of a rangefinder camera makes the X100 a compelling camera.<br /><br />The leather case makes it more so!<br /><br />$139?  Compared to the camera price, it's about 13% of the cost of the X100.  Perhaps that makes it more palatable.  By itself it's a hefty price for a case.  However, once you put the case on the camera you forget the cost as emotions take over and you realize the case and camera were made for each other.  They are both crafted and designed well, both needing each other to complete the look, feel, and emotion of owning the X100.<br /><br />The case is made well, and should last for many years if treated right.  It works as it should, and will give passerbys more reason to stop and ask how old your classic camera is around your neck.  :)
B003Y5H51K|1.0|If you're like me, you saw the trailer for this film and the prominent mention of James Cameron as executive producer. If you're like me, you loved Cameron's \\"The Abyss,\\" and wondered if there would be something here to love. If you're like me, you'll regret even spending the dollar at Redbox to find out otherwise.<br /><br />\\"Sanctum\\" is centered around a team of cave explorers in Papua New Guinea (actually filmed in Australia) as they go deep into a cave purported to be one of the world's most unexplored and possibly largest systems. Of course, a tropical storm is on the way, but they all believe they'll be just fine, with a few days to spare. The storm turns into a typhoon, the comm system goes down, and the team is trapped deep in the earth as the torrent of rain causes the water to rise within the caverns and threaten their lives. In the midst of these struggles, we find a teenaged boy at odds with his famous explorer-dad, and others who are more interested in self-preservation than in any act of human decency. We find bits of \\"The Abyss,\\" \\"Alien,\\" and \\"The Descent\\" all mish-mashed into a colossal mess.<br /><br />The first obstacle for me was the ridiculous dialogue, which sounded like teenagers trying to impress friends and screenwriters trying to fabricate drama. The next obstacle was the world-class explorers who panic and turn on each other the moment any danger hits. The third obstacle was the typhoon which arrives in seeming minutes, with no time to warn anyone even though a storm was known to be approaching days earlier. The fourth obstacle was watching experienced explorers leave others far behind in caves and then asking where they are. This is just ridiculous behavior by anyone who has spent more than a few hours outdoors or in the wild. The fifth obstacle was the tribal man shown three or four times for no purpose other than to suggest, I guess, that he has called this storm upon those desecrating his land with their exploration. If, in fact, he was meant to issue a warning, he never did so. It seemed his purpose was forgotten by the directors and writers. The sixth reason was that the film's two women are said to be adventurous in one case, and very experienced at cave-exploration in the other case, yet both die due to their own panicky reactions to things. Apparently women just can't handle the pressure of being in such a pathetic movie.<br /><br />I stopped caring ten minutes into the movie, but kept watching for the few scenes of beauty and natural wonder (the only reason for giving it one star). I began hating the script forty minutes into it, and by the hour-mark I hated myself for wasting a dollar and my evening. If you're like me, you'll want to pass on this mess.

0553386794|5.0|There are plenty of reviews praising this book, so let me write something a bit different.  The first time that I read 'A Game of Thrones' I wasn't quite sure what to think of it.  On the one hand, it was completely different from the Tolkien style of fantasy that I had been reading for a while, which was definitely refreshing.  There are no magic fireballs or know-it-all wizards in this book, and Martin is not afraid to kill off major characters to move the story along.  On the other hand, Martin's book felt more like a medieval soap opera than a work of fantasy on the first read.  After finishing this book for the first time, I was actually angry at a certain plot decision made by the author (if you've read the book you probably know exactly what I'm talking about), but I eventually began to understand why Martin made the decision he did.  After finishing 'A Game of Thrones' I was unsure whether or not I would continue reading the series, but I decided that I had nothing to lose, so I read on, and the series began to grow on me.  By the time I finished 'A Storm of Swords' (the third book out of a planned seven) I was completely and utterly hooked on the series, and the soap opera-ish format no longer bothered me.<br /><br />I guess the moral of the story here is that if you are undecided about 'A Game of Thrones after you finish, just keep on reading the series.  You will get hooked on the story and the characters, and you will get used to Martin's unique little touches which make the series so great.  Martin's type of fantasy was so new and different for me when I read 'A Game of Thrones' that I didn't quite know what to think of it, but the series grew on me quickly, and 'A Game of Thrones' is now one of my very favorite books, a novel that seems to get better with each read.
B004SIP69U|2.0|Chicago had a great cast and they performed very well.  However,  I found the musical numbers to be lacking good  catching tunes but rather flat melodies with no energy.  I love musicals and I find most of them to be uplifting and cheerful with lots of energetic tunes.  Chicago was to me a real let down.
0062060554|2.0|I think I was more disappointed in the hype and reviews that people billed this book as a thriller.  I don't spend too much time reading but when I do I want to be on the edge of my seat.  This book had so much potential and every time I thought it was going to take me somewhere exciting it let me down.  There is nothing more disappointing than reading an entire book and having the author rush to the most predictable ending conceivable.  Major bummer because the premise has so much potential.
B0050CQY1W|3.0|4 is by no means Beyonce's best album.  Since 2003, Beyonce has wowed us with her debut album Dangerously in Love and B'Day.  I Am Sasha Fierce was an album that tried to prove too much, which was the primary criticism of her last album.   Perhaps it was her way in trying to demonstrate her dominance in an industry that had rising stars in the forms of Lady Gaga and Rihanna.      Well, with 4, Beyonce has done an impeccable job at proving everything by producing an album that doesn't really try to prove anything.  Instead its an emotional journey of songs that probably mean more to Beyonce than her fans.  Which is fine, and makes this album work.    Trying to classify the kind of music found in this album is a disservice because the album is more more enjoyable if you start at track 1 and listen through the whole thing.  Trying to skip around to only listen to the singles or songs that get radio play or have received rave reviews does a disserve to the listener.  The album takes you on a journey, that is well worth it in my opinion.    Although, I dont want to contradict myself, the most standout tracks on this album in my opinion is \\"Best Thing I Never Had,\\" \\"Run the World,\\" \\"Start Over,\\" and \\"I Was Here.\\"    I honestly think, \\"I Was Here\\" is going to be performed on all the reality singing competitions, much in the same vein as Whitney's \\"I Have Nothing\\" will always be performed by someone who believes they have something to prove.
B00004W510|5.0|I really have a great fondness for this album.  Every time I play it I feel a sense of recognition from the loneliness and pain from Richard Manuel's voice.  Robbie Robertson is such a great songwriter.  Rick Danko and Levon Helm were such great musicians and singers.  Garth Hudson, one of the most underrated musician in a group.  I have such great respect for the Band.  Hopefully, once you listen to this album you will have the same admiration for The Band.
0307591549|4.0|Back in 2001, while working for Borders, we had Marcus Buckingham come in to speak about his new book, Now Discover Your Strengths.  In preparation for his talk, I took the Gallup StrengthsFinder assessment for the first time.  Positivity came up as one of my top strengths and it wasn't a surprise to me, as I've always looked at \\"the glass as being half-full\\".  That said, I'd never given it much thought as a strength and only thought of it as a characteristic of my personality.  In reading Shawn Achor's new book, The Happiness Advantage, I've realized that this \\"strength\\" is actually a key ingredient to the success I've experienced over the years.  In this great book, Shawn leverages years of Harvard studies and research projects to introduce us to the latest findings in the field of \\"Positive Psychology.\\"  He shares with us seven very practical principles that will directly fuel individual and team success and performance at work.<br /><br />At the core of Positive Psychology is the finding that \\"happiness leads to success in nearly every domain, including work, health, friendship, sociability, creativity and energy.\\"  It is the finding of positive psychology that success is a direct result of happiness and that the age old belief that happiness orbits around success is actually wrong and individuals who think they have to find success to be happy actually have it backwards.  After presenting us with the facts that show negativity has a direct correlation to poor success and true success can be tied to happiness, Shawn then gives us seven principles that will help us be more positive both inside and outside of the workplace.<br /><br />I won't spoil the book by going through the seven principles, but I will share some quotes from the book;<br /><br />* \\"..the more you believe in your own ability to success, the more likely it is that you will.\\" Pg 74<br />* \\"Beliefs are so powerful because they dictate our efforts and actions.\\" Pg 77<br />* \\"Constantly scanning the world for the negative comes with a great cost.  It undercuts are creativity, raises our stress levels, and lowers our motivation and ability to accomplish goals.\\" Pg 91<br />* \\"Optimism, it turns out, is a tremendously powerful predictor of work performance.\\" Pg 98<br />* \\"The key is not to completely shut out all of the bad, all of the time, but to have a reasonable, realistic, healthy sense of optimism.\\" Pg 104<br />* \\"The best leaders are the ones who show their true colors not during the banner years, but during times of struggle.\\" Pg 120<br />* \\"One of the biggest drivers of success is the belief that our behavior matters; that we have control over our future.\\" Pg 129<br />* \\"Knowledge is only part of the battle.  Without action, knowledge is often meaningless.\\" Pg 146<br />* \\"Habits are like financial capital - forming one today is an investment that will automatically give out returns for years to come.\\" Pg 148<br />* \\"When we encounter an unexpected challenge of threat, the only way to save ourselves is to hold on tight to the people around us and not let go.\\" Pg 173<br />* \\"The most successful people I've worked with know that even in an extraordinarily competitive environment, we are more equipped to handle challenges and obstacles when we pool the resources of those around us and capitalize on even the smallest moments we spend interacting with each other.\\" Pg 183<br />* \\"Studies show that the more team members are encouraged to socialize and interact face-to-face, the more engaged they feel, the more energy they have, and the longer they can stay focused on a task.\\" Pg 185<br />* \\"The people who actively invest in their relationships are the heart and should of a thriving organization, the force that drives their teams forward.\\" Pg 187<br />* \\"Studies have found that the strength of the bond between manager and employee is the prime predictor of both daily productivity and the length of time people stay at their jobs.\\" Pg 189<br />* \\"The best leaders give their employees the space and time to let moments of social connection develop on their own.\\" Pg 193<br />* \\"Smiling tricks your brain into thinking you're happy, so it starts producing the neurochemicals that actually do make you happy.\\" Pg 206<br />* \\"Each one of us is like that butterfly (the Butterfly Effect).  And each tiny move toward a more positive mindset can send ripples of positivity through our organizations, our families, and our communities.\\" Pg 210<br /><br />The Happiness Advantage was easy to read and it is filled with great stories and examples from both Shawn's personal life as well as various research studies from other psychologists involved in Positive Psychology.  While some business and psychology texts can be technical and boring, I found The Happiness Advantage to be insightful, practical, easy to read and light reading.  It is was compelling and I would recommend it to anyone.  We read the book as a team at work and we all came away with a number of changes and reminders that were directly applicable to our team.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend as a teambuilding book to read as a group.op on their own.\\" Pg 193  * \\"Smiling tricks your brain into thinking you're happy, so it starts producing the neurochemicals that actually do make you happy.\\" Pg 206  * \\"Each one of us is like that butterfly (the Butterfly Effect).

B00000IFWE|4.0|Echo is arguably Tom Petty's sister album to 1994's Wildflowers. It is introspective and thematically revolves around his divorce. It is mellow like Wildflowers but the production is rawer and more honest. On Wildflowers, the rockers sound kind of neutered because of the overly polished production. The other songs on Wildflowers benefit greatly from that crisp and uncluttered production. Here, we have the same style of basic folk and roll songs but with a live sound that binds the album together. There isn't a bad song in the bunch and they are all enjoyable to one extent or another. The melodies throughout the album are catchy and intricate. There is an elaborate interplay amongst the instruments and the melodies that keep the album interesting from beginning to end. There is a healthy dose of country on this album that probably defines it as Petty's \\"countriest\\" album to date. This is pure country/rock at its finest. The only song that I'm not that happy with is ABOUT TO GIVE OUT, which is just a little bit too country and not enough rock and roll for my taste. As in Wildflowers, Echo contains some of Petty's best ballads ever. It is a great, summer, sit-on-the-porch, sipping something or another kind of listen. One of TP&H's best. Highlights:<br /><br />ROOM AT THE TOP<br />COUNTING ON YOU<br />LONESOME SUNDOWN<br />SWINGIN'<br />ECHO<br />WON'T LAST LONG<br />RHINO SKIN<br />ONE MORE DAY, ONE MORE NIGHT
0316066524|3.0|I like this book.  I keep it on the nightstand to read when I can't sleep.  It has some great vocabulary, entertaining footnotes, and incisive insights.  Imagine Kurt Vonnegut on super steroids backed up with the complete OED.
0553801503|2.0|This entire book felt like filler between ASOS and whatever was SUPPOSED to come next in the series. Unlike ASOS and ACOK this book is unnecessarily long. It could have easily been cut in half.     If I had read this book after a 5 year wait from ASOS I would have been severely disappointed. Luckily I'm reading books 1-4 over 8 months.
B003UESJHE|5.0|Absolutely terrific.Can't wait to see it again.  Will also show to many of my friends on Blue Ray  when they will think they are in the theatre once  they see it it on my big screen.The acting is great.  Colin Firth mastered his part  as did Jeffrey Rush.  Highly recommend this purchase from Amazon.
B001563I5C|4.0|My Blueberry Nights (drama, romance)<br />Directed by Wong Kar-Wai<br />Starring Jude Law, Norah Jones, David Strathairn, Natalie Portman and Rachel Weisz<br /><br />Optimum Home Entertainment   2008   95 min   Rated BBFC: 12   Released Jun 23, 2008<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: VC-1<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />The first thing to mention is that My Blueberry Nights is not yet available on Blu-ray in North America. This review refers to the Region B UK disc.<br /><br />In the opening scene, we are introduced to Jeremy (Law), who runs a diner in New York. He's originally from Manchester, England, but seems at home in his surroundings. He knows people by what they eat. Elizabeth (Jones) is a customer who is asking whether her boyfriend has been in the diner. Jeremy confirms that he was there and had dinner with another woman.<br /><br />The two begin to talk on a regular basis. Elizabeth leaves her keys at the diner so that Jeremy can give them to her boyfriend. He listens to everything she says and is part friend, part psychiatrist and part restaurant owner. The two share a bond of sorts and he also reveals details of his own previous relationships. He keeps her keys in a jar with countless others and Elizabeth learns that he knows the story behind each set.<br /><br />Jeremy also talks to her about food, explaining what sells well and what doesn't. He offers her blueberry pie and ice cream and mentions that the blueberry pie is often untouched at the end of the day. There's nothing wrong with it, but people just make other choices. I think Wong Kar-Wai is comparing people to food with that observation. There's nothing wrong with Elizabeth or Jeremy, but both are alone.<br /><br />The camera on the diner wall serves as Jeremy's diary. He likes to watch the recordings at the end of the day to see what he's missed. Wong Kar-Wai's camera doesn't miss anything. When Jeremy and Elizabeth are talking, we see them from afar. There's often a counter or something in the way of the camera so that we feel like voyeurs, spying on an intimate conversation. Other notable techniques include the use of vivid colors and the blurring of motion, as well as slow motion and images which are sped up. Wong Kar-Wai uses the same techniques in other films such as Chungking Express and Fallen Angels.<br /><br />Without declaring anything, it becomes obvious that Jeremy and Elizabeth care about each other. But Elizabeth seems wary of relationships after her recent experiences and decides to take some time to think about what she really wants. She works in various bars and diners and eventually winds up in Memphis. It's there that she meets Arnie (Strathairn), who drinks in her bar. She listens to Arnie, talks about her dreams and gives him advice. I like Strathairn's performance and consider him one of the most interesting characters in the film. Is it a coincidence that Elizabeth becomes someone who will listen to people's problems, just as Jeremy did with her?<br /><br />Elizabeth writes to Jeremy regularly, but never reveals her address or phone number. He misses her and tries randomly calling bars and diners to find her. Later, he decides to send postcards, and ends up sending hundreds.<br /><br />Elizabeth rarely stays in one place for long and has a series of adventures. The most prominent one happens when she encounters Leslie (Portman), who plays poker for high stakes. Elizabeth learns more about herself as the film progresses, especially from Leslie.<br /><br />Will Elizabeth and Jeremy ever meet again? I won't reveal that here.<br /><br />Norah Jones did a great job on her acting debut. The story is stylish, intimate and a little unconventional. If you like other Wong Kar-Wai films, you'll almost certainly like this. Ry Cooder's score is incredible and perfectly matches the mood. There are some other well-placed songs, especially the two haunting numbers from Cat Power. If you're a fan of Cat Power, look out for a cameo appearance by Chan Marshall.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />Optimum's Blu-ray presentation looks great. The stylized color scheme is striking and the detail strong. There are no obvious problems such as dirt or print damage. The film looks clean and almost perfect. Any blurring is purely intentional and a regular occurrence in Wong Kar-Wai's films.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5/5<br />The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track delivered everything I hoped for. Although the film is primarily a dialogue-heavy story, the use of music enhances the atmosphere. Cooder's guitar is wonderful and the other songs all come across well. You won't have to strain to hear any of the dialogue and I couldn't detect any faults in the mix.<br /><br />Special Features 3/5<br /><br />10,279 Miles Since Hong Kong: My Blueberry Nights - A good \\"making of\\" feature with cast and crew.<br /><br />Cannes Press Conference - Director Wong Kar-Wai and actress Norah Jones face the Cannes media.<br /><br />Character Study - A short piece featuring comments from cast and crew.<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />My Blueberry Nights will appeal to lovers of film for its interesting use of color and unusual camera angles. It's a romance of a sort, but less conventional than most. Some of the discussions will stay with you if you're the sort of person who analyzes what you have just seen. Fans of Wong Kar-Wai shouldn't hesitate. If this is your first Wong Kar-Wai film and you liked it, Chungking Express is well worth checking out.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this DVD before I got pregnant and did it for a few weeks.  I remember it being really hard but I felt so empowered when I got finished, thinking \\"Yes!  I did it!\\"  I was already in shape then so I didn't see HUGE changes, but my stamina increased and I definitely got stronger.  Fast forward one year, I've had a baby and spent the whole nine months of pregnancy eating whatever I wanted and not exercising much.  Needless to say, I am no longer in shape at all and not pleased with my postpartum figure.  I pulled out my 30DS DVD yesterday thinking there was no way I could even hope to keep up anymore.  Well....I was wrong!  I actually made it through Level 1 and the only move I modified was the push-up (I did \\"girl push ups\\" which were still very hard for me).  I was so surprised that I could do all the ab work, even after a C-section.  Of course I was winded and exhausted, but I went from feeling hopeless to confident that I can get back in shape.  I wanted to write this review because now I know it is a great workout for people of ALL fitness levels.  I can't wait to see the changes in 30 days!
159102594X|4.0|I really enjoyed the character development, and the details of the book, however it took just a little longer to develop than I owould have liked. It felt a little like when the book finally climaxed, it ended. I assume this was done to entice you to read the next book.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Got this HDMI adapter to stream video from my iphone 4 to the TV via HDMI. Works well and no complaints. Not sure why people are saying that the video quality is bad but I have yet to experience that! I stream movies that are stored on my iphone 4 and also via the PlayOn App that streams from my home PC. Both works well.     In addition I also use the \\"display out\\" tweak on Cydia (Jailbreak) to view content that doesn't work by default on the iphone4.     If you dont want to jailbreak thats fine. The adapter works perfectly.

B00138CUYM|5.0|Remember seeing Accept in concert in the early 80s when they opened for Iron Maiden at Poplar Creek and they have remained one of my favorite bands ever since. Originally had this album on cassette but it has long ago been missing. Also who uses cassettes anymore?

B00574P9EQ|4.0|Watched this last weekend w/my 2 boys (10 & under).  We all enjoyed the movie.  Even laughed out loud a couple of times.<br />Enjoyed this movie more than the original Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie.<br />Found it refreshing to watch a story about 2 brothers who learn to get along, as there aren't too many of those around.<br /><br />Kids:<br />No need to close your eyes during the \\"horror scene\\", it is not scary.  Well, unless feet creep you out.<br />Story line doesn't follow book completely.<br /><br />Parents:<br />This movie is PG for a reason, so watch it with your kids.  You'll want to stomp out any ideas that your kiddos get from watching this movie.  Rodrick is a prankster and poor role model.<br />I know my older boy had a glimmer in his eye when watching these boys pull over a few things on their parents.  Stomped those ideas out best I could.  Only time will tell.<br />I highly recommend you read these books if you haven't already.  We read these books out loud as a family and the Wimpy Series is the funniest material I've read in recent times.  Not sure you should be too impressed with that statement, but there it is.<br /><br />Overall: I had my expectations set pretty low and walked away delighted with this movie.
B000BSDVRA|5.0|I was given an officer's model 30 years ago by my wife. I still have it, and apart from the tip of the knife being broken (someone used it as a screwdriver) it's as good as the day I got it. I have always carried it with me, either in the car, on the bike, or in my backpack, and it has served me well and got me out of a spot or two. I'm a tradesman who's spent most of his life in mechanical engineering or electrical work and that knife is by far and away the best quality and most versatile tool I've ever owned.<br /><br />My son has little respect for his toys, breaking everything in the box. Nothing lasts beyond the warranty period. He's currently studying IT at university and constantly asking to borrow tools.<br /><br />With his 21st birthday fast approaching my wife and I agonized over what to buy him that he would appreciate, and couldn't break.<br /><br />We bought this pocket knife for him because I knew it would last the distance. The 'Cyber' tools are appropriate given the context in which they'll be used and the torch is no gimmick. It really works and lights up the work area for the screwdriver extremely well.<br /><br />If there were any criticism I would say the bits for the screwdriver may get lost, and the torch is made of plastic. But having said that, the magnifier on my old knife is plastic and it's still 100% good.<br /><br />When looking at my old knife against the new one they are almost identical. The new cyber-tool has translucent red sides and is a little wider with a few more tools on board, but all in all, it's the exact same quality. In fact, I'm sure if I stripped the two knives down the parts would be interchangeable.<br /><br />Unless he loses it, I'm guessing he'll still have it when he's an old bugger like me.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|The book is a short, simple, easy read. Don't let that fool you. It contains some of the best advice you as an Indie Author are ever likely to receive. Let's face it, an Indie Author who has made the 1m sales mark has to have something of value to tell you.<br />Locke's advice is clear and to the point, and some readers may be disappointed that it's so simple. Locke doesn't, as one reviewer says, have an audience in the millions, at least not yet. He made those fantastic sales figures by cultivating loyal readers who bought more than one of his books. But those loyal readers do number in the hundreds of thousands, so he's clearly doing something right.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough to those indie Authors who are prepared to put in the work to follow his system.
0596805527|4.0|It took me a month to read through the book.<br /><br />The core JavaScript part is comprehensive but a little bit boring, but the problem is caused by the language, not the book. Since JavaScript is a bad language, any other authors couldn't do much better.<br /><br />In the client-side part, some topics (Window, DOM, CSS, Events) are explained very well; some others (Ajax, jQuery, SVG, HTML5) are shallow.<br /><br />The two reference parts are not so necessary, because online references could serve better.<br /><br />I am a little confused by the author's English. For example, why are the titles of chapter 15 and 16 scripting aaa and scripting bbb, but the titles of chapter 18 and 21 scripted xxx and scripted yyy? Sometimes ECMAScript 5 is referred as ES5, some other times it is spelled with full name. Consistence is a problem.<br /><br />The layout of the book is not perfect either. Cross-page boxes are ugly. There are orphan subsection numbers. For example, there is only 10.1.3.1 under 10.1.3.<br /><br />The author tried his best to tell everything he knows, but not every good thing about JavaScript. Well, It's a mission impossible for a $30 book.
1400049628|5.0|I am big into field manuals so it spoke to me.  But the part that kept me reading the most is how the author used historical events that placed zombies right here, right now... and if i were foolish enough to not be aware of these events and how they really occured, i could become some dim-witted conspiracy nut.  Well played...
B003Y5H51K|4.0|Another cave movie, much like the Descent, without humanoid creatures attacking the main cast.<br /><br />It was interesting to see how everyone attempted to escape the underwater caves.  There was the usual part where one of the group members attacks the rest of the group, but here it seemed to make sense, and it wasn't a really big part of the movie.<br /><br />Good story and very suspensful.  I felt some of the dialogue slowed down the movie a bit.
1591841666|5.0|The Dip is a small book (80 pages), it's also a small format.    It talks about crossing the tough patch before achieving success. Godin calls it, \\"the Dip.\\"    This tiny little book is one of my favorites by the author. It's an inspirational book that will infuse you with hope and energy, like a friend that shows up in tough times to usher \\"don't give up!\\"    Some reviewers wished The Dip had more to offer . . . it doesn't have to. This is inspiration at its best. No sugarcoating. I let you be the judge. It can't be better than this:    \\"If you want to be a superstar, then you need to find a field with a steep Dip - a barrier between those who try and those who succeed. And you've got to get through that Dip to the other side. this isn't for everyone. If it were there'd be no superstars\\" (Page 33).    In an age were everything is woo-woo-feels-good, Godin tells it like it is. That's very refreshing! If you want inspiration in a condensed format this is a fantastic book.    In addition, if you're looking for more meat, I also recommend you check out Drive by Daniel Pink and [[ASIN:1463531915 reDESIGN: reCREATE: Reinvent Yourself and Thrive in the New Economy]] Both are great.
B004A8ZX28|2.0|I'm not surprised by the mixed reviews on this movie because I watched it with four other people and we were split on what we thought of the movie.  I was in the camp that did not see it favorably.  The problem is that I can't quite put my finger on what is wrong with the movie.  All of the ingredients are there: a man develops amnesia, everyone he remembers doesn't remember him, people are after him, there's action, it takes place in Berlin, top actors are in the movie.  But yet it didn't work for me.  It was like someone threw all of the right ingredients together but forgot to stir and put it in the oven at 400F.    The acting, in my opinion was poor.  The action scenes were too brief and predictable for my taste.    This movie seemed to borrow heavily from the Bourne movies, but didn't use any of the elements it borrowed in a new way.  The final twists are verging on preposterous as well.  I won't go into detail, but I found it hard to buy.    Overall, I don't recommend this movie.
0553582038|4.0|George RR Martin has been called the American version of JRR Tolkien. Aside from the two Rs in the middle of their names, I see no similarity. More like Jane Austen, with teeth. When Martin says, at the end of Book IV, that A Feast For Crows was \\"all the story for half the characters,\\" does that mean that everyone who had a chapter heading in Book IV will never be heard from again? That is what I take it to mean: he's told \\"all their story,\\" right? I cannot imagine how this can be so, and will be very disappointed if that's the case (we'll never hear from Cersei, Jaime or Arya again? Samwell I can take or leave, and the same can be said of Sansa). My brother, who began reading these books years before me, told me I should stop reading them after Book III (much the same can be said for Stephen King's Dark Tower series), since they started to devolve, not evolve, after that point. I was thoroughly engrossed with Book IV, however, and finished it in under a week...but that last little addendum thrown in by the author was enough to sour my anticipation for Book V.<br />I would much rather have had half the story for all the characters, the same as we had for the first three books. The thing is, he keeps adding more characters! (the last 77 pages of Book IV are dedicated solely to family trees). The overall story is called A Song of Ice and Fire for a reason (it's obvious Martin has been setting up a war between the dragons--Fire--and the wild creatures that live beyond the Wall--Ice--) but I think the journey, not the destination, is what has kept us all reading over the years. If everyone in Book IV is just suddenly done, their story finished, it will be pointless (kind of like what happened to Brienne).

0609610570|2.0|I listened to the first 40 minutes of this book (audiobook) on my commute this morning.  I didn't count incidences, but the two authors use the word \\"execution\\" so many times that it makes me feel as if they're selling me something; something they don't really know how to articulate.  It's totally understandable that they don't know how to articulate a definition of leadership which one can't find in the dictionary, because any leader will tell you that the way to learn how to lead is through practice.    They shouldn't have written a book about a subject for which they knew they could not articulate.  I think Larry Bossidy (Butch Cassidy) and Ram Charan (The Sundance Kid) will have some interesting stories to tell.  These stories will likely provide an example to follow (or avoid).  But I don't think they're going to break any new ground here.    To learn how to organize to get things done, read Getting Things Done by David Allen.    To learn how to have the characteristics of an ideal person for leadership, read 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.  I like the mini edition: it fits in any typical shirt or pants pocket and you can read it in about an hour.    To learn how to manipulate people and circumstances for your favor and create an environment wherein people want to do what you want them to do, read The Prince by Nicolo Machiavelli.    Also useful are the lists created by the United States Marine Corps for leadership traits, leadership characteristics, and others.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|The first time I've seen this movie and I enjoyed this so much. I expected nothing from ''Blade runner''. But I was overwhelmed by how good the movie was. In the first minutes I already liked it and as I was going further into the depths I found it so catchy I couldn't put it down. Even when I had to pause the movie I kept thinking about what could possibly happen next. For me this movie is a must have. Great classic science fiction.
0596809158|5.0|I haven't seen a better introduction to R than Paul Teetor's R Cookbook,            published by O'Reilly.  While it follows the  familiar O'Reilly cookbook    format, it also provides a gentle introduction, with all the necessary    information to get started  As a particularly nice touch for a cookbook, it    includes basic statistics and input/output in the early chapters so that the    reader doesn't need to wade through (or fearfully skip over) a lot of    material before getting to the needed resources.      A common complaint with other R resources is that the novice in    statistics is overwhelmed with statistical terminology.  Teetor    is not trying to provide a statistics textbook, but he includes refreshing    explanations for the underlying statistics.           Some chapters are particular standouts:      Chapter 2: Some Basics.  This chapter is an appetizer of what R can do,    and it's very helpful to get this early.  Aside from the basic usage of R    covered in this chapter, section 2.6 (Computing Basic Statistics) provides a    quick introduction to performing basic statistics with R.      Chapter 4: Input and Output.  R's input/output support is a bit cumbersome,    but the R Cookbook provides examples for many common cases that newcomers    need to handle (text files, CSV's, etc).        Chapter 9: General Statistics.  This is the meat and potatoes of R for many    statistical users.  Students in a basic statistics course (or practitioners        needing to do most fundamental analyses) will find chapter 9 to be    indispensable.      Chapter 10: Graphics provides a nice dessert as visualizing data is often    critical to understanding it.  Teetor provides simple, concrete examples    that cover many of the common graphics, as well as how to handle their    titles, labels, and legends.      As an added bonus, Teetor and O'Reilly provide Chapter 14: Time Series    Analysis.  The coverage here goes beyond standard cookbook fare and provides    a good starting point for those interested in Time Series Analysis.      Overall, the R Cookbook is the best O'Reilly cookbook I've read since the    release of the Perl Cookbook, and it's by far the best introduction to R    that I've seen.  It's a must-have for every newcomer to R.      [Disclaimer: I got this book for free as part of the Oreilly blogger review    program I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have    expressed are my own.

B0050CQY1W|4.0|First I'll say I'm not a huge Beyonce fan I own all her albums but B'DAY is the only album I can listen to all the way through so I was kinda looking forward to this new album. The first track out was RUN THIS WORLD (GIRLS) and I was not impressed I tried I bbought it on iTunes but it seems like... beneath B, not her best! She then tried 1+1 at AI and again I was unimpressed, it just seemed like a really bad B-Side and the lyrics were just weak. PARTY is another track that's just not doing it for me, I really dislike Kanye and he co-wrote and co-produced this track his bookend \\"raps\\" in the song are unnecessary and the title is deceiving its a slow jam so it should be called BORING PEOPLE GET TOGETHER :)... those in my opinion are the weaker tracks.<br /><br />The best track in my opinion is BEST THING I NEVER HAD the official second single and this track is great from the beat to the vocal power down to the lyrics, I love it! I just love the message of moving on from this one-sided toxic relationship that you're the only one working at. LOVE ON TOP is also among my favorites it has a funky old school sound to it, I like my Beyonce when she throws on her freekum dress and gets sexxy! I MISS YOU is a sweet ballad which is a pretty self explanatory song about missing your lover when their gone, its a ballad with a pretty sick beat, almost reminiscent of Britney Spears' INSIDE OUT. COUNTDOWN<br />and I CARE are both really good one a club stomper I love the<br />literal countdown during the chorus and the latter a ballad about<br />caring more for someone than they do for you. RATHER DIE YOUNG & START OVER are both solid efforts not spectacular but good its nice to see the way B must feel for Jay. END OF TIME has to be a single I love the marching band feel to it and I know visually it will just make the song soar to that epic status you expect from Beyonce! Lastly I WAS HERE is a so-so typical Diane Warren ballad sweet lovely but I think B should stick to her own writing to truly connect.<br /><br />So Beyonce did a better job than GaGa but for me ranks below Britney's FEMME FATALE and Selena Gomez and the Scenes WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN.ect.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I recently purchased this having previously owned Polar HRM's.  I was a little unsure of what to expect from Garmin - but having used this a few times now for running, I think it is truly excellent.  Firstly the watch is easily customizable to determine what information to display on screen when you are working out.  A cool feature is that you can let the GPS guide you back to your start (or another location you may have saved).  I have used this quite successfully.  Great when exploring unfamiliar locations or on vacation (as I am currently).<br /><br />Getting back home, the Garmin software for the Mac is great.  The watch wirelessly transfers data to the computer automatically.  The autolap feature lets you see your split time for each mile (you can specify the distance) - and the really cool thing is that you can see your minute by minute HR and elevation at the same time.  The 3 graphs (HR, Speed, Elevation) are displayed next to a map of the route you ran which is great.  I have not yet explored the features where you can define workouts on your computer and download them to the watch.  If you run a set route often - you can compare your performance between one run and another.<br /><br />Being a Mac user i had felt neglected by Polar for some time - but not so with the Garmin.  If you are not a runner you can set the sport mode to cycling, or other - and then log those work outs too.  To conserve battery life it is very easy to turn off the GPS feature - and just turn it on when you are going to use it.  I am looking forward to trying it while cycling.<br /><br />I have no hesitation recommending this device - and I would buy it again in a heart beat!  It is amazing what they can put into a small package.  They have done a great job of the software for both the watch and the computer.
B000002IAS|1.0|Ok to start, I just want to make clear that this is a fantastic album. The reason for the one star is to warn those planning to purchase the MP3 version that Track 3 -- \\"Only You Know and I Know\\" -- is NOT a live version. In fact, it is identical to the first track on the studio album \\"D & B Together.\\" If you listen to a sample of both tracks, you'll recognize right away that they are the same.    Non-completists might not care about this, but to get the live version of \\"Only You Know and I Know,\\" you'll have to buy a non-digital copy of this record.    FRUSTRATING. Especially considering that the catalog of this superb superb duo is EXTREMELY difficult to acquire. Motel Shot has not been re-released in the states. Neither has From Delaney To Bonnie. You would think that forty years on, the recording industry could figure out what Eric Clapton, Joe Cocker, George Harrison, and Dave Mason all knew at the time: Delaney and Bonnie is worth it!    But hey, they've done the same thing to Gene Clark's catalog, so maybe it is a strange kind of compliment.
1594202842|1.0|I will keep this brief and just say that I agree with many other posters here:  this book champions the verbal and emotional abuse Ms. Chua inflicted upon her daughters and sells it as \\"superior parenting.\\"  Ms. Chua's self-congratulatory, egocentric assessment of raising her little girls saddened and sickened me.  I wonder how the author's daughters will feel about their childhood twenty years from now, when stroking their mother's ego through their own successes has lost its shine?

1597801585|5.0|OK.  The story might not be for everyone.  (*Spoiler*: it's dark.  Unrelentingly dark.)  PB so thoroughly immerses his readers in the world of this novel, from page one, that it's hard to imagine why any disaffected reader would persist beyond the first chapter.  But then, I can't imagine how anyone could leave this reading experience anything other than wowed.  PB creates a completely believable world in this novel.  Everything about TWG is pitch-perfect -- the characters, the narrative, the mis-en-scene.  TWG is not simply a great sci-fi novel.  It is a great novel period.  As fellow author Lev Grossman, quoted on the book cover, says: \\"I hope [PB] writes 10 sequels.\\"  I'm with you, Lev.  TWG is an outstanding novel, and PB is a master of his craft.

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|Oh dear.<br /><br />For the record, I liked the \\"Sex and the City\\" show, which chronicled the lives of four single (mostly 30-something) women in New York City. Although the women were all successful upper-class types, which allowed for the show to feature plenty of fashion and frivolity, the characters were always portrayed as human beings who had real problems that made them relatable. The show ended gracefully after, I think, 7 seasons, without wearing out its welcome as so many TV shows do, and allowing the characters to seem to be embracing more mature relationships and lifestyles.<br /><br />Flash forward five years, and viewers were presented with the first SATC film. It was a commercial success, but creatively, I found it to be redundant and mediocre. Flash forward two more years, and the second SATC film goes far past redundant and is just plain offensive.<br /><br />The main characters, once upper-class yet relatable, are now ridiculously spoiled and self-centered. Carrie, once a free spirited columnist, now lives in a posh penthouse with her husband, John. Carrie's biggest problem is that John wants to stay home and have take-out after work, instead of accompanying her to a premiere. Also, she is upset that John gave her a big screen TV for their anniversary instead of a piece of jewelry. Poor, poor Carrie. Charlotte is now married to an attorney with two children. Not only does Charlotte not have to work outside the home, but she also employs a full-time nanny. Yet in Charlotte's most emotional scene, she cries about how overwhelming motherhood is. I'm sure all the single, working-class mothers in the audience could feel her pain. And then we have Samantha. Samantha's character has always struggled to accept herself for who she is - a successful woman who was just not meant for a conventional monogamous relationship. Sadly, in this film, her character has become a parody, not an icon of empowerment. She's outraged when a salesperson at a boutique suggests that a dress is perhaps age-inappropriate, and then wears the dress to a red carpet event where she runs into Miley Cyrus, wearing the same dress. And this is supposed to suggest what, exactly ... that's it's empowering for a woman over fifty to still be trying to dress and behave like a teenager?<br /><br />Somehow, the film makes some excuse for the four, downtrodden heroines to take a free trip to Abu Dhabi. As if the film weren't already offensive enough, now the girls are off to the Middle East, where they expect another culture to embrace their materialism and brash sexuality, and are shocked when it doesn't. Oh, and Aidan shows up for no apparent reason, other than to rehash a storyline that was supposedly resolved 7 years ago.<br /><br />Please, please, please, stop beating this dead horse.s age-inappropriate, and then wears the dress to a red carpet event where she runs into Miley Cyrus, wearing the same dress.

0307472841|5.0|This is a stand-alone mystery-thriller, not part of Mankell's award-winning series about Detective Kurt Wallander. It is every bit as good as those celebrated novels. The plot goes back and forth between contemporary Sweden and China, and the 19th century in those countries (as well as Africa, America and a few others). It's a novel that is every bit as much about globalization, especially globalized labor slavery, as it is about a mass killing in a Swedish village that transfixes that country for its bizarre brutality. The main characters are exceptionally well-drawn and appealingly flawed, and the amount of history the author manages to artfully convey is truly outstanding. Mankell is a master at applying philosophical and economic themes to thrilling mystery narratives. Unlike other perfectly good mysteries, this novel also provides answers to questions about the world we live in. Mankell describes a brutal place, getting more brutal all the time as a result of overpopulation, underemployment, and environmental degradation.<br /><br />Rebecca Burke<br />Author: When I Am Singing to You
B0051MKNV8|5.0|Imagine if you could take a drug that makes you smarter, more eloquent, better in every respect.  Imagine if the more you took the drug, the better you became.  You're still you, you're achieving your your full potential, not the slacker we all secretly fear we are. That's the plot of Limitless.<br /><br />Edward \\"Eddie\\" Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a writer some potential, enough potential to get a book advance, but not enough to actually write it.  Wallowing in self-doubt after his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) breaks up with him, he bumps into the brother of his ex-wfe. Vernon Gant (Johnny Whitworth) slips Eddie an $800 gift in the form of a little translucent pill, NZT-48. Bored and frustrated with his life, Eddie turns to the drug and bangs out 40 amazing pages of his new book in three days.<br /><br />Things go south when Vernon ends up dead, leaving behind his stash of the illegal NZT. It's a drug addict's dream: an endless supply with no side-effects. Or is there?<br /><br />It turns out everyone is secretly using NZT and prolonged use kills people. With enough drugs to keep him clear for a long time, Eddie focuses his brilliant intellect on trying to figure out how to beat the drug's side-effects.  Along the way he will try to win his ex back, get an amazing job with a ruthless executive (Robert DeNiro as Carl Van Loon), and fight off the criminal underworld (Andrew Howard as Russian thug Gennady) who wants a piece of the action.<br /><br />Limitless is like a sci-fi version of Trainspotting - it glamorizes, then demonizes, then glamorizes drug use with a futuristic sheen that makes it palatable to modern audiences. The movie's ending stays true to the title...or does it?<br /><br />See, Limitless is a drug addict's tale told by a drug addict, a narrator reminiscent of Fight Club.  You can't trust a single thing he says, even as he confides in how he conned everyone else - except for you.  Of course.  But there is a price, and for those who pay attention, it's clear that NZT does extract a price: your soul. That ending elevates Limitless from a crowd-pandering trifle like Crank to a thoughtful meditation on what it means to achieve your full potential at any cost.e: your soul.

1439110123|5.0|Yergin rewrites the history of the last 150 years through the perspective of the oil industry.  Oil is the hidden hand that controls unfolding events.  Is it any accident that the U.S. and Russia became the great powers of the 20th Century? -- they were the two early leaders in oil production.  War machinery starts to shift to oil in World War I -- battleships goes from coal to oil; and the French and British pioneer the military use of automobiles and tanks.  World War II is all about oil.  Japan starts the Pacific War in response to American embargo of oil and with intent to seize the oil fields of the East Indies.  Hitler strikes out for the Russian oil fields and overextends himself.  By the end of the war he lacks the oil to feed his new jets, tanks, and armored divisions.  An important front of the Cold War involves competition for the new oil in the Middle East.  And finally, the history of the last 20 years is dominated by Hussein's attempt to get a corner on the oil market by seizing Kuwait and threatening Saudi Arabia.    More fascinating than the wars is the lack of wars over this major commodity.  As Yergin points out, the largest wealth transfer in history is the one to oil exporting countries in the late 20th century.  The system of oil concessions that split profits with the host company is abandoned; host now takes all.  These small, militarily weak producing countries were able to seize all of the profits and to reap extraordinary profit from the intense demand for this product.  Remarkably (with the exception of Hussein's gambit) there is no assertion of military power to interfere with this. I suppose that too much is at stake for the big players to make a power grab -- it's in everyone's interest to cooperate so that we don't descend into international economic and political chaos.        Yergin also sees the business cycle as driven by oil.  The economy under Carter fails because of high oil prices.  An oil glut in the 1980's explains the success of the economy under Reagan.  The economy rebounds in the mid to late 1990s because of cheap oil.  And the boom times of the early years of the 21st century is also explained by cheap oil.  Supply and demand oscillate wildly over the years and the exporters and oil companies strive to stabilize the market.  At present, demand is extraodinary given the emergence of China, India, and a host of other eocnomies.  Conservation efforts have the effect of moderating demand, and at times the willingness of producers to cheat the quoata system combined with conservation efforts have led to boom times of cheap oil.      As Yergin points out, fears that we will soon run out of oil have always been present.  Certainly there will be a push to get oil from more difficult locations and a push for more alternative energy sources and conservation.  So the oil won't run out, but the cost of it will spiral upwards and the ability of the world to sustain prolonged boom periods is doubtful.      Yergin does a good job of making very dry material interesting.  He explores the personalities of the men involved in this industry, and he writes well.      This book will take you forever to read, but it will change your view of history.

B000YPUF9W|4.0|I really liked the first Resident Evil movie.  It managed to find its own voice in a venerable first-person shooter horror franchise with Mila Jovovich. She brought a cool sensibility to a Alice, who by all rights should only be eye candy.  The film's script was respectful without slavishly adhering to the original series, which rarely made much sense anyway.<br /><br />The second Resident Evil movie was a mess of whip cuts, blurry action sequences, character stereotypes, and a paper thin plot. All is forgiven with Resident Evil: Extinction.<br /><br />Extinction picks up right where Resident Evil: Apocalypse left off. The zombie plague continues to spread, the Umbrella Corporation still plots in its burrowed-out secret lairs, and Alice is still an out-of-control killing machine. Extinction starts out just like the first installment, with Alice in a red dress wandering a plastic-wrapped mansion, and for a moment her confusion is palpable - I thought we had recorded the wrong film at first. But then it becomes clear that a diabolic experiment is taking place with Alice at its center.  In that regard the movie plays like a Resident Evil greatest hits: There's the creepy little girl! There's the rabid skinless dogs! There's the laser mesh death trap!<br /><br />But now that the infection has spread to the world, Resident Evil shifts gears to another popular horror staple: the zombie apocalypse.  All this testing takes place in a military facility surrounded by zombies, reminiscent of Day of the Dead.  Alternating between Umbrella's fiendish plans is the survival of most of the characters from the first film. Making up for the absence of Jill and her miniskirt is Claire (Ali Larter of Heroes fame), who leads the ragtag band of survivors that struggle day to day with issues of food, fuel, and morale. And then there's Alice, the supersoldier with trust issues.<br /><br />Alice, Umbrella, and the survivors all eventually collide in a winner-takes-all battle for survival. This film is not afraid to kill off beloved characters and it gives them a suitable sendoff. The final monster battle is mitigated by the concluding scene, in which Alice promises revenge against Wesker and all of Umbrella. It's a memorable shot that's worthy of the Resident Evil franchise.<br /><br />There's a whiff of devil-may-care in what was supposed to be the final installment of the Resident Evil series. It destroys the established Resident Evil universe, taking it in a completely different direction from the game.  And that's how you revive a franchise.off beloved characters and it gives them a suitable sendoff.

B000VSAEYI|3.0|I bought this pool for my 1 year old last year.  We used it a couple of times and it was great to be able to fill it up with just a few inches of water for him to splash around in safely.  We took it out again this year hoping that since he is now 2 and more active we could use it all summer long.  First, I am pregnant at the moment so I had forgotten how streneous it was to inflate it.  Last year, my husband and I took turns blowing air into it and it took us about 15 minutes between the both of us to get it filled.  This year, i just did not have the lung capacity and my husband went out and got an air compressor, it did the job but the pressure of the air must of torn something inside because now some of the sprinklers do not come up as high as before and the whole inner tube fills with water (and not just where it is supposed to fill up for the sprinklers)which is a pain to deal with when you are trying to empty it out at the end of the day.  Also not all the sprinklers face into the pool, some squirt out making it difficult to get close to the pool without getting wet if you need to assist your children with anything.  Overall, my son LOVES this pool but I will be purchasing another one because it is too much of a hassle inflating & deflating.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|It came early and was what I expected, except the invisible ink marker was dry. Luckily all you have to do is soak the tip in water for a few minutes and it works perfectly.
B000LC51TM|5.0|It arrived on time, I am very happy with the live footage of the concert. Rammstein is always great live and   I recommend fans of the band to buy this CD/DVD immediately.
B0055FR5PS|5.0|I never rate movies/shows that I watch on Amazon.  That is until I noticed that this movie was only rated an average of three stars.  Therefore,I thought I would throw another 5 Star rating into the mix.    A great movie with dialog that perfectly matched what was required/needed.  Haven't been in combat before, but dialog seems appropriate to what would exist.      A lot better than Independence Day or any other movie/tv show that has featured aliens series over the past couple of years.    A great movie to watch on the 4th.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|It's amazing how much time I've spent on this game - it's got great depth, and the difficulty levels are wonderfully well varied. I can't remember the name of the Palm game that it reminds me of, but I'm impressed that this game is even better.
B000JQV68A|4.0|I found Fitzgerald's second novel (published shortly after This Side of Paradise) to be rather uneven. Both protagonists (Anthony and Gloria Patch) are tediously self-absorbed throughout most of the story, and this makes it difficult for me, as a reader, to care about what happens to them. It also seems to me that none of the secondary characters comes to life in a believable way. Some of the dialogue, particularly that between Anthony and his college friends, is longwinded and pretentious. However, there are occasional flashes of brilliance that make reading this American classic a worthwhile effort.    The Kindle edition was clear and readable, with only a few small editing issues overlooked.
B000XUUQQK|3.0|Boogeyman 2 starts off with a girl at her birthday who witnesses her parents murdered by an unknown force known as the boogeyman. She is sent to a hospital that is run by Tobin Bell of Saw fame. It's kinda like Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors minus the dreaming part or the big budget. Most of the kills are creative and gory, the boogeyman looks like a guy who fronts a metal band or the creeper from Jeepers Creepers. It was a good movie for what it was. I'd recomemnd this even if your like me and have not seen the first in the series.
B003UESJEW|5.0|I went to see this movie frankly because I didn't have much else to do on a very snowy, wintry day. After I left the theatre, I was very glad I made the trip.  The movie is very well-written, and acted. The characters are portrayed wonderfully, and the actors are all top-notch. I thought the movie was also very significant to the era we are now in. If you're a fan of any of these fine actors, get this movie for your collection, you will be glad you did.

B002ZTIIXK|2.0|This music compilation was exceptional, although I would have loved to have \\"Pulling Back the Reins\\" and could have done without the Tony Bennett duet and Lady Chatelaine. My problem is that when I received my CD I had trouble playing the 2nd disc. Amazon was very good about exchanging my set. When I received the replacement I had the same problem with the same disc, except this time the 2nd disc wouldn't play at all. If it is my CD player, then why does it play all other CD's regardless of age? The packaging is cheap, and apparently it was mass produced in such a way that the output is too weak for all disc players.
B004K7HMJ6|5.0|I am really enjoying this CD - it arrived very quickly from Amazon - and straight onto the CD player.  I'm dancing still.  Jessie J is a singer of today's music.  Love it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I couldn't believe when people say this game was more fun than Angry Birds, well it's true. Nice puzzles that make you think and act fast. After experiencing the non working levels of Summer Pignic on Angry Birds Seasons I gave this a try. It's a great deal at the regular price of .99 cents. It's working well on my G2 with CM 7.1 no problems at all.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game and am extremely addicted!! It's fun and time consuming. Definitely worth the money because it's much more than just the typical made for mobile game since it was originally produced for the pc. Unfortunately after I beat the game it glitched and lost my save file. Extremely frustrating!!!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|First, the single Born this way is a complete Madonna rip off. If you don't feel that way you were probably not alive in the 80's. But, let's move beyond that. Gaga is very talented and this album is very creative. After listening to it a second time there are many catchy songs and she does have her own sound. I give her a lot of credit. After hearing Poker Face a few years ago I thought she would be a fade. Turns out she in it for the long run.
B000000OA6|4.0|A Queen revival seemed to be in the air in early 1991 when the band released their 14th studio album, `Innuendo'. In the US, a new record deal had been signed with Hollywood Records (owned by the Mouse House) who would rerelease Queen's entire back catalog on CD.  The prior decade had seen enormous success for the band everywhere in the world except for the States so it seemed high time for Queen's popularity to see resurgence. Little did the public know was that Freddie Mercury was dying; a tragic secret of which only the band and its closest advisors were made aware. Despite the fact that Queen had not toured anywhere in over four years and had not been to America in seven, Freddie's AIDS situation was not common knowledge, thought the tabloids speculated. Anyway for the final album released in Freddie's lifetime, `Innuendo' is as much a mixed bag as any of the later Queen records, though some of the regal majesty that had been missing for over a decade returned on such songs as the epic title track and \\"The Show Must Go On\\".  Like any but a small handful of their records, `Innuendo' sported several hit singles and they are all very good, although `These Are the Days\\" is just too much supermarket/doctor's office easy listening pop for me.  I don't love this record but I do feel that Queen went out in style and the full impact of the album would be felt later that year with Freddie's passing...RIP Farouk Bulsura
B0008ENICU|5.0|This movie so far exceeds the remake it's impossible to put it into words.  The writing is excellent, the actresses beyond great. It's humorous and makes its point well, too. You can sympathize with Norma Shearer, laugh at Mary Boland, and hate Joan Crawford. The first time I saw it on TCM I didn't expect much, but was very pleasantly surprised!    The plot centers around Mary Haines (Shearer), who discovers her husband has been seeing a sales clerk from a local department store. There are various very entertaining sub-plots as well. You see how the lives of some of the NYC wealthy elite weave together, and how all the women deal with their problems.    Oh- and I bought this at the request of my 15 and 17 year old daughters! They love it, too, and so went to the theater to see the remake. They came home disgusted at what they felt was gratuitous profanity, drug use and near nudity, but more than anything because the new movie first makes Mary culpable for her husband's cheating and then a negligent mother. It's quite out of keeping with the original. I think the lesson is, when you have actresses like those in the 1939 production, writing by Claire Booth Luce, and George Cukor directing...don't mess with it.    This is a keeper, and if it ever wears out I will be buying a new copy.
B002IC10Y8|5.0|I bought for my wife for her Birthday. She really enjoys the selection. The CD sleeves are only cardboard and cheapens the feel a little, but it is all about the music.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|It's several stories about Sherlock Holmes so how could you go wrong. Classic tales with a classic character that you can put on your Kindle for free. I would give it five stars but there are some formatting issues (very few though) so it keeps it from being perfect. Other than that this is a must have in your Kindle library.
B001NFU5WE|5.0|I got this for $10. What a steal. The digital copy had expired, but that is ok because I go the one from the DVD I bought when it was first released. Special edition with mask packaging and blu-ray for $10, sweet.
B000ZK3YDK|5.0|This Is the first Justin Timberlake product I have ever purchased, The reason that I bought this specific dvd, was due to a display advertisment I seen at Walmart in the music section. I wanted something in the form of a dvd music video, so that I could try out my new JVC Video system in my vehicle. I must say, I really enjoyed the entire performance. Justin Timberlake is a excellent multi-talented artist. Every person that has been in my vehicle has seen some or all of the footage from this performance at Madison Square Garden.They noted that this Dvd Video is a excellent buy. Great entertainment, especially if you are going on a long trip, and you can watch & listen to good music while traveling.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|Does anyone have any word on when this classic might make it to Blu-Ray?     I'm also hoping that when the blu-ray does eventually make it we might get all released of the film, not just the new censored one.
B001853NZK|5.0|I love all gears from Ultra Pro so this 3&#34; collectors album is no exception.  I love collecting sport cards so this album is my favorite.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Let's be clear (especially to certain other reviewers), these are NOT new movies, indeed they have been out for long enough that we're not looking to review the content of the movies, but the quality of this release.     This edition contains everything you could hope for from an ultimate trilogy blu-ray. All the special features are there as too are the digital copy's.    I'm the first to admit that the second movie was terrible, and the third was little better. However this release is as good as it gets in terms of content.    For those of you out there who haven't seen the movies, I'm sure you can find people much more qualified to review the movies for you than you could find on here, and it might be worth renting them before you buy. But make no mistake, for what it is, this is perfect.
B003L77GRO|2.0|I am kind of done with Dexter.  The beginning was awesome but then it got kind of repetitive and boring.     I think Showtime should shelf this series and move on to something else.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|As with so many others on here I recommend waiting. I just bought the collectors blu-ray of Close Encounters, it has a little book, interviews, and three, yes three, versions of the movie. We've all seen Star Wars and know what to expect from the movies, so all we really care about here are the extra features... oh wait, there aren't any! Just take a glance at the comparison chart on the product description page and you will see just how many Star Wars releases there have been of late. This is just their first try. A new version will come along (\\"The Complete Saga - Collectors Edition\\"), which will include all of the versions of the original trilogy, the original special features, and maybe even a few new ones. The less people that buy this the sooner they'll realize the need to release the real deal. Let's wait.
B004SBQAN8|3.0|This movie is a bit cheesy at times but fun.  :D  I just wish they had more battles and special effects.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|One interviewee references the crazy investments and deals engaged in by Wall Street which created the 2008 Financial Credit Crisis as \\"weapons of mass destruction.\\" If there is one underlying point I think being made by \\"Inside Job\\", it is that Washington has become beholden to Wall Street executives who write much United States legislation that benefits their own goals, and Wall Street may need to have much less of a voice in legislative decision-making, but that is probably not going to happen any time soon. The argument made since Ronald Reagan has been that easing and in some cases eradicating certain checks and balances in the financial market, i.e. regulation, would cause heightened prosperity for all, and regulation stifles prosperity. But in fact, except for those in the top 1% income bracket and other elites at the top of the heap, wages for average Americans have been generally stagnant for the last 30 years, while earnings at the top have increased exponentially. Top financial executives who used to make a few hundred thousand a year, which still seems like a lot of money, receive pension packages and stock options now worth in the hundreds of millions, while many other Americans barely scrape by and lose their jobs and their homes.<br /><br />In 1981, Ronald Reagan, in his inaugural address, stated that \\"Government is the problem.\\" Reagan was blaming the economic woes of the 1970's on government regulation. In the 1970's, the U.S. experienced one of the worst recessions since the 1930's. However, the reason behind the recession really had nothing to do with over-regulation. Because Europe had been devastated by World War II, the US had a short-lived monopoly on exports, particularly because its manufacturing infrastructure was possibly the best-functioning in the world while Europe was rebuilding. America fueled a reputation of having the best products and the best services in a global market from about 1945 to 1970. But by the 1960's, Europe's manufacturing infrastructure had rebuilt itself and no longer had to rely exclusively on American products, and Japan was also entering into a global market. At the same, American companies began to cut corners in terms of quality products, and the combination of new manufacturing competition from Europe and Japan caused a reduction in consumer demand for American products which plunged the United States into a recession.<br /><br />Ronald Reagan did not blame corporate America for its short-sightedness and its unwillingness to innovate, which is what a lot of economists now feel was partially responsible for the recession. Instead, Reagan and the Republicans blamed the US Government for the recession, and his economic advisers advocated a reduction of government agencies and a significant loosening of regulation in business. The mantra became \\"regulation stifles business\\" which therefore \\"stifles economic growth\\", even though there was almost no historical evidence to this effect. This anti-regulation rhetoric finally caught up to the financial sector in the late 1990's under Bill Clinton, and significant deregulation of much of the legislation passed during the Depression was enacted.<br /><br />According to the documentary, the deregulation allowed financial companies to engage in a buffet of risky enterprises which 20 years ago would have been illegal. For example, investments banks, which primarily engage in helping companies find capital for projects, could now buy and sell individual loans in the same way Wall Street bought and sold stock. The industry convinced itself that these loans were the next big investment haven, and these loans would be packaged to investors like stock. Investment banks convinced investors that these loans were low-risk high-yield investments, and therefore demand for these loans, particularly housing mortgages, began to skyrocket. Smaller mortgage companies began giving loans to anyone who would sign their names on the contracts, despite whether or not they could pay the money back, and these were sold to the investment banks who would turn around and sell them to investors.<br /><br />The inevitable outcome was that when many of these risky mortgage-holders started defaulting on their loans, the housing bubble ceased and prices began to drop. When prices dropped, investors stopped buying these loans and investments. And companies like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were holding billions of dollars of \\"toxic mortgages\\" that they had planned to sell to investors but now couldn't, which caused a ripple affect in the industry and plunged the US into a recession. Essentially, these loans being sold to investors were much riskier than the investment banks characterized them to investors. Many of these investors, including retirement and pension funds, lost billions of dollars.<br /><br />The moral of the story is that there has to be much more governmental oversight into the operations of these financial companies. Governmental oversight does not mean these companies can't do business, but they have to be held accountable and should have to pay penalties if they engage in fraud. Some have argued the investment banks were defrauding investors, and fraud is a felonious crime which can result in jail time. But the sobering reality is that most of the people who advise our law-makers are not the people who predicted the crash, but Wall Street insiders who are ultimately interested in their own corporate objectives rather than the economic well-being of the nation as a whole. Still, corporate finance, despite having nearly destroyed their own industry is still fighting tooth and nail to prevent the very regulation that has helped the US prevent these recessions. It is interesting that some of the largest advocates for financial deregulation declined to tell their side of the story for this film.pay the money back, and these were sold to the investment banks who would turn around and sell them to investors.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is really good. Its filled with adventure which for me gave me something to think about. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for humor and adventure.
B000UNYK76|5.0|The production values, cinematography, and audio quality of this DVD are fantastic.  Lots of cool footage of Italian scenery and off-stage interviews in between the concert footage.  This is easily one of the most enjoyable rock documentaries / concert films I have seen.  Right from the beginning of the DVD when the band is about to take to the stage, I felt the same thrill of anticipation as I've experienced at the actual Pearl Jam concerts that I've attended.
B0034G4P8K|4.0|Let me say this from the start: Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a quantum leap improvement over its wretched predecessor ([[ASIN:B0019M5C0Q Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].  Featuring a comprehensible story that flows logically, some solid acting from Shia LaBeouf (in top form as the hyper Sam Witwicky), Peter Cullen (who IS Optimus Prime), John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, and Patrick Dempsey, and top-notch special effects, it is a fun ride that is very enjoyable to watch.    In fact, if someone stopped the movie after the first half, I would have said that it was THE best of the three movies by far.  (Minor spoilers ahead) Transformers: DOTM takes a risk in its opening scenes by deciding to jump into conspiracy theory territory with its assertion that the Apollo lunar program was designed to get NASA astronauts to the moon to investigate an alien crash landing, but the risk pays off marvelously as the film masterfully interweaves news footage of the lunar landing with the mysterious discovery of a crashed Transformer spacecraft.  This spacecraft (The Ark), as it turns out, contains Sentinel Prime (voiced by the always excellent Leonard Nimoy), former leader of the Autobots, in stasis.  Sentinel, in turn, is the only Transformer who can activate a device that could not only unleash an army of Decepticon warriors on Earth, but even end life as we know it.  The movie contains some nice plot twists and double crosses that I will not get into here, but all in all, it has a solid plot on par with the first film.  Visits from likeable characters from the previous films- Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White), Agent Simmons (John Turturro), Lt. Colonel Lennox (Josh Duhamel), and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are very welcome.    Oh, and for those who were wondering if Megan Fox could be replaced, YES she can.  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, besides featuring her obvious beauty and attractiveness, acquits herself quite nicely in her first movie.  Will she be winning an Oscar from this film?  Of course not, but let's face it: the script uses her mostly as eye candy, but she admirably rises above that as Sam's likeable and sweet new girlfriend.    Where the movie loses a point, and thus falls behind the first movie ([[ASIN:B00005JPNO Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] IMHO, is in the second half, when the Autobots and Decepticons engage in a battle royale, winner-take-all struggle in Chicago.  It is at this point in the movie that you can almost sense that the script has been barely holding Director Michael Bay back like a rabid attack dog on a leash.  Once we get to Chicago, the leash is dropped and Bay ferociously attacks the viewer with a special effects assault unlike anything seen before.  Now, the effects are UNDENIABLY impressive.  The 2007 original film featured very impressive effects, and it is surprising how much they have improved in four years time.  Autobots and Decepticons destroy humans, buildings, and each other in a dazzling display of digital imagery.  The mistake Director Bay makes is failing to heed an important lesson: LESS IS MORE.  By having frame after frame after frame of shooting, explosions, carnage, and mayhem, eventually I became numb to the special effects and they lost some of their punch.    (Also, a word of warning to those who go see the movie in 3D- eat your popcorn/munchies before the battle in Chicago.  Besides numbing, I found the all-out special effects extravaganza to be slightly nauseating with the non-stop motion, loud noise, and explosions.)    In short, the movie would have been better if the Chicago battle was cut in half.  I cannot believe that SOMEONE- one of the editors or Executive Producer Steven Spielberg, for example- did not urge Bay to cut back on the special effects-laden climax (although in fairness, perhaps they did and were overruled by Bay, who is clearly in love with his digital toys that he can blow up).  Bay is a talented directorto be sure, but the movie would have been better served if he had allowed the viewer to breathe from time to time in the second half.    So what we're left with is a fun summer, popcorn movie that I will be excited to add to my DVD collection right next to the first movie, and is a good end to the trilogy.  The new movie - wisely - ignores the second movie almost completely, so I think Transformers fans can be proud to have the first and third movies on their shelf and pretend the second one never happened.  Both Director Bay and Shia LaBeouf have stated that this is their last Transformers movie.  That may be for the best.  I would be excited to see what a director like J.J. Abrams - or even Steven Spielberg himself- could do with a Transformers reboot.  A movie that balanced character development, plot, and the JUDICIOUS use of special effects would give us the Optimus Prime of Transformers movies.
0385737955|5.0|I don't know why people say that this book is in the same league as Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, in all honesty, The Maze Runner is way BETTER.   James Dashner opens the book with protagonist Thomas, rising in a box lift for about a half hour, before the box stops, and is opened by a group of boys. Like the other boys, Thomas has no memories of his past life. Only his first name remains in his mind. The boys call themselves \\"Gladers\\" and live in a make shift society in the center (of what Thomas soon finds out)is a gigantic maze. The maze consists of huge walls, so high,the tops are dark. At night, the gates that connect  the boys'\\"Glade\\" to the maze close, the maze walls shift,and heinous half mechanical-half creatures known as Greivers swarm the maze's paths. When a person gets too close to a griever, they either face death by its many metallic weapons, or an injection with a deadly venom that can only be cured by making it back to the glade for a serum and undergoing the painful three days of \\"the changing\\"; a curing process that can possibly open up past images and change its subjects whole personality and sanity. Right away Thomas finds he is different. He has a strange sense that he has been in the artificial world before, people who have undergone the changing dislike him, and he has a high calling to become a \\"Runner\\"; one who runs the maze during the day to map it out. When the glade's first girl(!) shows up in the box, an abnormal day right after Thomas, and shares she is the last one before entering a coma, events are triggered that lead to the necessity of solving the maze fast.     There are many specific things that I really like in the book.     First of all, this book is never boring. Lots of action and inquisitiveness- inspiring plot.     In the boys' society a believable mini government is created to keep order. Specific jobs are assigned to each boy for living purposes and only runners enter the maze for the safety of all the Gladers.     Eachboy has a specific and believable personality. Some authors have a hard time dealing with so many characters and being able to consistently make them individual. When the reader meets Thomas, Newt, Minho, Alby, Chuck, Teresa, Frypan, Gally ..etc they can think specifically, \\"wow, that is totally something Minho would do\\" or feel as confused as Thomas feels. In the Hunger Games I don't feel too much deep thought about any of the Characters, including Katniss.     It took me a bit to get used to... but I thought it was ingenious to add the glader lingo in the beginning so, without swearing in a YA book, there is still the dramatic seriousness and realistic-ness that swearing adds. Yes, if you were stuck in a torturous maze with a bunch of boys I imagine there would be curses- instead; there is klunk, slinthead and Shuck. I also like the none curse words that appear in glader culture- shank, beetleblade, changing, runner, Keeper, blood houser, med-jack, gathering, slammer etc     I am pumped for the sequel. And once again, I hope this book varies from Hunger Game, in that it doesn't repeat the same exact plot in its second book.

B0036S4CTS|5.0|I found this book so good I had to put it down because I didn't want it to end. And when it did, I was left utterly devastated. It was beautifully written, painful and realistic and surprising. Rarely does a book leave me feeling the way this one did: hopeful, but then torn apart and raw with sorrow. I cried for the last two hours of reading it, completely unable to contain myself (and for several hours afterward). Even now (hours after finishing it) I still feel that sadness behind my eyes and I can't stop thinking about it. It's left me lost and unsure of what to do next. I recommend this book for the pure spectrum of emotions it stirs inside the reader and the sheer bliss of reading about these two people who forged their way through a great friendship.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games sets up a voyage for the reader which will exhaust you, test your character along with the characters in the book and honestly test your resolve. Collins paints a vivid world where everything is real and true to mankind. Evil exists in each of us and Collins shows this throughout the book. Her refusal to sugar coat anything and show the honesty of pain, suffering, tough choices, sacrifice and hurt make the reader unable to put the books down; no matter how much pain it may bring the reader to continue. The themes throughout the book are so honest that at times the reader may have to step away, only to realize quickly the desire to continue is so great it is worth the discomfort.<br /><br />Collins will evoke some questions within yourself in ways few have accomplished and will leave you wondering why life has to be the way it is. Why pain doesn't completely go away and why at times we ourselves don't know what we truly desire. This book is definitely worth the read, but I WILL GIVE ONE WARNING:<br /><br />YOU ARE NOT PREPARED FOR IT. The Hunger Games will introduce you to a lot of things in the end you'll wish you hadn't experienced along with Katniss but in the end you'll surely be content knowing you took the voyage.

However, a friend of mine said she liked it and leant me the trilogy.  If you haven't read it, buy this hardcover boxed set now!  I guarantee you're going to want it.  I raced through my friend's books and then I had to buy my own copy.  Since I loved it so much, I wanted hardcover to add to my home library.   This is a nice boxed set and the outside box is not as flimsy as other boxed sets I've purchased in the past.  Nice gift too.

B00000J048|5.0|I really hesitated to purchase this for my son for his 4th birthday, but I'm so glad I did.  I was deliberating between this and a fancier, battery operated, \\"bells and whistles\\" type gear toy.  I'm so glad I purchased this product.  Not only does he enjoy it, but my 6 year old girl and 8 year old boy love it too.  They sit and play with it for long periods of time.  All of them put it together different ways and my 4 year old gets a little help from his siblings.  It is very durable and will last for years, I'm sure.  I love toys without batteries that have lasting value for multiple ages and this fits the bill!
B004EI3ON4|5.0|One of the things that really caught my attention when I saw TRON: Legacy was its soundtrack, and it works well by itself. (Perhaps even better than the movie.)
B0052VUNHC|5.0|to even think that someone could love a book as much as i did this one is completley insane, however it is in fact THAT GOOD!    i read this book in one day and even after that Abby and Travis were all i could think about. they were so real to me it was like you had just gotten off the phone with them. The plot at times could have been laid out a little better and it is ABSOULUTLEY not a book for young children unless you would like for them to read about how to make a baby frame by frame. BUT.......,     It was by far the BEST book i have ever read and recommd it to anyone that is looking for something that will change they way they think about true love and the power of fate.
B004GYOQ6A|1.0|Force closes on samsung galaxy tab running honeycomb 3.1. this is after trying multiple levels and restarting the tablet. Hope this is fixed soon our it will be a wasted day of free amazon apps
B003NX75B8|4.0|This is a very good story. To be honest the way the authors showed the different Will Grayson's with all the lower case writing was a little frustrating. But that is a petty complaint. The story itself was enjoyable. I really want to have my own Tiny friend. There were parts that were a bit slow...but never to the point of boredom. I became very invested in these characters and was tickled with the ending. This book needs to be on your short list.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Love this game, but makes my phone crash... I can play a handful of levels and then it starts getting jumpy and closes itself.  Hoping for an update that would fix whatever is causing that because I would love to be able to waste more time playing...

B003UYUP6M|4.0|If you are interested in learning about super egotistical individuals like Larry & Sergey and how they effectively used their personal quirks to build an empire, this book is for you.  The author luckily does a great job of showing how peculiar Larry is and how, when he gets his mind to it, he is super frustrating to work with (at least that is what I took away).  Sergey is your typical deeply analytical individual who most empires need to be successful.<br /><br />The key part that I think I took away from this book is how Google has built the super infrastructure that is the modern web.  The all commodity approach and design expecting failure is the bar setting way to go about building online services of this decade.<br /><br />Beyond learning the great infrastructure work, Levy did a great job showing just how dysfuctional Google is at building strategy and that they are highly unsuccessful way more than they are successful.  If they didn't have the great search engine driven by the innovative AdWords they might not be prevalent.  They have found other niche areas with minor success but way more failures and this is a case study for how to *not* run your business when it is growing.  My opinion...<br /><br />Still, great read and excellent job by the author!
0439023491|4.0|I would imagine anyone reading the review for the second book in a trilogy has read the first. So to encourage these people to read this one as well, I am going to relate my own feelings at the end of the initial book and how I felt going into this one.<br /><br />At the end, as I mentioned in my review of The Hunger Games, I was left feeling very unsatisfied. It became way too much about the love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale. After a fairly dark book about children being forced to fight each other in a battle to the death, Katniss's whiny tantrums, selfishness, and unnecessary emotional outbursts feel very out of place. And it was also a thematic departure from the rest of the story.<br /><br />So feeling this, I still went ahead and downloaded the second book to my Kindle and began reading. After my initial reaction to the end of book one, the first quarter of Catching Fire had me really worrying. There is a lot of time devoted to Katniss's underdeveloped emotional core and conflicting personalities. By which I mean, on the one hand, she is supposed to be cold and distant, and on the other, she seems completely unequipped to deal with even mildly stressful romantic situations. I don't know why Katniss was written this way, but to me it just didn't make sense, at least to spend to much time saying essentially nothing, since she never really draws any conclusions from the way these two boys make her feel.<br /><br />But more to the point, I genuinely wanted to put Catching Fire down and stop reading it. Because this is not the kind of stuff that interests me. If I want teenage drama I will go read Twilight. Which I mean...I wouldn't, but I'm just saying. However, I can chalk up a win for my mild OCD at needing to see the conclusion to things made in parts, so I did not put Catching Fire down (if I had, I probably never would have finished reading it).<br /><br />And to relief, the focus begins to shift about a third of the way through the book, from Katniss and the secrets she keeps only to provide hollow filling to the story, to actual substance. I can't much about the story without spoiling anything, but I will admit I was pleased (if not blown away) by the book's conclusion. I suppose I wish that in such a well-thought-out universe, these books were longer. But I suppose that might have caused me to stop reading them as well.<br /><br />Catching Fire is, in my opinion, just as good as The Hunger Games, and are fairly similar in structure. But it's okay, because the author manages to keep things interesting for the most part. It is nothing but to the credit of the trilogy that I devoured them all in a single weekend. I do have to say, though, that if you are looking for something genuinely dark, look elsewhere. There is a lot of darkness inherent just in the premise of the book, but there are times I felt like more description of certain events would really have magnified the readers' emotional connection to certain passages.<br /><br />For anyone on the fence, I would recommend Catching Fire, if for nothing else than to bridge the gap between books 1 and 3, because 3 is nearly flawless in its execution.iss and the secrets she keeps only to provide hollow filling to the story, to actual substance.

B002N83GYE|4.0|This is a good read to learn about the history of the man, and the empire he finally has built.  I think that overall you learn what you were looking for when grabbing this book and I found it an interesting read to learn how this guy operates.  I did find it, ironically, to venture off of Steve a bit more than I'd like and focus on other individuals important to the Apple empire which is odd for the title of the book.  Nonetheless, I give it a solid 4.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|As a self employed women who became a stay-at-home and still thinking woman, this book resonated.<br /><br />As a purest reader, I laughed til I peed my pants.  Go Tina!
B0000088R6|4.0|On line there is a video performance of Sacrifice that is, to use the word properly for once, awesome. Unfortunately, the VHS tape, apparently the original source, is very poor, with smears and audio dropouts. The four stars are given only in that the CD performance is doesn't have quite the same impact, and although I might be swayed by Lisa Gerrard's expressiveness in the video.
B0040ZPLBY|2.0|This series is good for kids or young adults, as long as they have access to the more original arthurian legends to balance it out. The acting, directing, and writing are precious and overly sentimental and the retconning of the arthurian legend seems so unnecessary as to make one wonder why they didn't just create a whole brand new story with new characters and call it something else entirely. I'm disappointed that they made Arthur, Gwynn, Merlin, and Morgana all the same age. It's like watching Young Hercules with all that entailed. If you're a true fantasy fan, don't waste your time with this, especially if you like the more classical stories of Camelot and King Arthur.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater, but I'll admit I left a bit confused with the editing at times. After watching the extended (and originally intended) cut on this combo, it's plain to see why.  Many reviews I read complained of slow-motion and montages, which are actually just the result of trying to shorten this movie! It makes a lot more sense when you see the extended version.  By the way, haters, the \\"Sucker Punch\\" the title refers to is that the girls are dressed skimpy but this movie wasn't made for the boys! Nor was it made for women who think owning one's sexuality is disempowering. You can wear ankle-length skirts all you want, but I have to commend Snyder for accurately portraying a fangirl's daydream.  In my mind, I'd be kicking butt in an impossibly sexy outfit while still being formidable. These girls are tough but some reviewers say they are acting \\"butchy\\" i.e. they expect girls dressed this way to act like strippers, but these girls all carry themselves in a classy way.  This movie is NOT misogynist.  I think the real misogynists are the ones who can't take a girl seriously because her clothes are skimpy.  This movie is supposed to be divisive.  It's not made for everyone, but I appreciate it for being different from every comic book remake out there.

B0050CQY1W|3.0|Beyonce is one of the greatest entertainers in the music business today but there were elements leading to such success such as the spotlight of a girl group and the aggressive management from her father. Now that neither of those are in the mix Beyonce is making her own decisions she has decided to take risks as an artist trying to prove she is an artist and not just an entertainer. Most times when artists take risks they usually theme their work from their recent or current life experiences and Beyonce can put out as many making the album release videos she wants expressing how heart felt this album is etc etc it still lacks a theme. The title itself is based on her favorite number her mothers and husbands birthday dates it's like okay and? The 1st single run the world had all the potential in the world to be a hit but still fell flat because lack of something much like the album   Itself, but then she released a track about love also with a numbered title there was hope this album was going to shape up to having a real theme the bluesy sounding track with her aggressive deep vocals and high vocals and a love song that could be a theme song or dance number for the bride and groom for many weddings in 2011 the disappointment was it wasn't the next single. Although Beyonce is almost 30 years old it was weird hearing her say \\"make love to me,\\" over and over again when her roots were kid friendly bubblegum pop dance numbers, perhaps if the lyrics read \\"give love to me,\\" the song may not be as adult but could fall right in line with the wedding themed/bedroom themed track \\"adore,\\" by Prince. Also I think a little bit more of that base bluesy music playing a little bit longer would give it a little more umph, in which ironically most of her tracks are under 4 minutes (maybe that was the theme?). Well although through the lack of an artist theme the album has a few winners on it maybe not hits but \\"party,\\" exuding that 90's sound Keith Sweat made famous mixed in with a rapper we haven't heard from in years Andre 3000 is one of the winners. Her 2nd actual single \\"best thing I never had,\\" although catchy but if you're trying to be different and make this album original it's simply irreplaceable part 2 one of her biggest hits. Okay Bey make up your mind are you going to try and do something different or simply repeat history. \\"I miss u\\" is enjoyable but has the same feel as \\"dissapear'' from I am...Sasha fierce. Notice on the fierce albums most of the singles was from the fast side, so why put out an album  With so many slow songs and speaking of songs how do you come from a double album to a 12 song album, it just feels incomplete and rap music in the 90's started the whole 15-17 track albums so if you are chanelling the 90's then why so few songs? \\"I care\\" has potential a heartache song in which is keeping Adele at the top of the charts right now. \\"End of time\\" the only other real dance beat on the album may save 4 from it's sappy overview. All in all 4 is good but let's hope 5 is better or she won't keep her reign as \\"king b,\\" \\"princess of pop,\\" or whatever self proclaimed title artists give themselves really.
0091940737|5.0|My original review, in which I spent 35 minutes typing (because I typed a few excerpts from the book) has magically disappeared. So, I won't be retyping all of it again. I'll just briefly say that I don't remember why I went to Britain for a book, but I'm glad I did. There is humor in nearly every sentence, and her ability to make real life stuff comical made this a really funny book.<br /><br />For example, at one point, her friend goes for a waxing, so she'd be ready for their night on the town. Later, the friend complains that this guy should just phone her and ask her point blank if she would like to get together on Saturday for a good shag (sex). She's tired of always waxing, without knowing for sure if she's getting any that night.<br /><br />There's a lot of funny stuff in this book. I think I just did an 'eenie, meenie, minee mo\\" when I chose this book, but it was a good pick. UNFORTUNATELY, this book was not available on Amazon.com at the time, so I had to purchase it from Amazon's UK website. There is also no Kindle version available to US customers. I don't get why, since they DO have a Kindle version in the UK!<br /><br />Good book, but no Kindle version available.
B000SEKZLC|4.0|I enjoyed this book from the begining right through to the little bit rushed ending. A different approach to the novel shows that a debut can bring something a bit different to the market.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|When I read the basis for this book I was intrigued. The story is about a women who after sleeping has no memory of what happened before. She awakes thinking she is 20 years younger and no idea of where she is. The story has many twists and turns and is quite a suspenseful novel. I was captivated throughout waiting for the proverbial \\"next shoe to drop\\". interestingly I found out that this condition is not unheard of in real life. There is a documented case of Clive Wearing an English musician crippled by total amnesia, and the wife who tried to find a cure, then ran away to start her life over, and finally came back to him. In his case the place in his brain where memory is stored was destroyed by a virus. His memory is very short on the order of 7 min. As for Before I Go To Sleep --- only draw back the $12.99 price point which is to high. Final rating: Recommended.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|I applaud FX for delivering another stellar series.  I loved Nip/Tuck and Sons of Anarchy may be even better!  The gritty, dark storylines are realistic, and I never find myself questioning the probability that the scenarios actually happen somewhere.  Watching in Blu-Ray just made it that much better, and I'm waiting for a price drop to purchase seasons 2 & 3.  I can't wait for season 4 to start!!
B001SS3JS8|5.0|the story drew me in from the very beginning with realistic characters and a beautiful love story.  of course it hit very close to home since i have an eighteen year old son of my own.  all i heard from my family while i was reading the book is \\"are you all right?\\"  i guess it provoked a great deal of outward emotions.  i was so engrossed, i didn't even realize it.  i just wanted to be left alone to READ.  loved... loved... LOVED IT!
0316069884|5.0|This is such a great book.  As hard and sad as the topic is to approach - the author really takes a neutral stand and gives the reader the facts to make the decisions themselves.  Personally I now only eat meet from small family owned farms that can explain the life of the animals and the processing choices they make.  I feel so proud to say at the end of the day - I did not cause any animal pain from the food choices I made.  This is A MUST READ for everyone - its amazing how no one knows this is going on.
0399230033|4.0|I had read other reviews that indicated that there weren't a lot of words in this book, but the \\"story\\" seemed cute so I thought I'd try it anyway.  The pictures really are very nice and the concept of the story was just as fun as I expected it would be.  After looking through it though I do think it could have done with more words.  I purchased it for a 1 year old so having just pictures isn't terrible, but I think the book would grow with a child more and be enjoyed for longer if it had some words and could be read rather than just looked at.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|Fantastic arrangements of some of Sting's best music. If you liked the live \\"Bring On The Night\\" recording, you'll love this disc as well.
0679882820|5.0|I've never read the non-board book version, but other reviewers have said that the board book leaves out some content.  I believe that because it doesn't seem to flow quite as well as other Dr. Seuss books do, but considering that the board book format is much better suited for very young children than other book formats, I feel like that's an acceptable compromise.  This book has enough pages to make it a legitimate \\"story\\" unlike some other board books that only have say...3 pages.<br /><br />The one year old it was purchased for seemed to enjoy it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD because I moved to a small town where the gym facilities are lacking. I thought, why not? I've never tried any of Jillian's DVDs before this. The 30 Day Shred is awesome! I was in good shape before this DVD, and I definitely thought Levels 2 and 3 were tough! I am past the 30 days and am still doing it. It's a great quick workout that is about 25 minutes for each level. My only complaint is that you can't fast forward through the introduction. I've already bought more of her DVDs- keep up the good work Jillian!
B00008H2LB|5.0|What a great album.  Pure one hundred percent truthful emotion.  They are saying everything I always wanted to say.  This music really speaks to me.  The production is fantastic too. Buy it today and listen to the whole cd in its entirety.  You won't be sorry.  You'll feel better!
0307165485|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for a young friend of mine. I can't imagine any youngster not enjoying the works of Richard Scarry, plus I enjoy the pre PC artwork on the cover, featuring a lion smoking a pipe.
B001TXQCEK|5.0|Dio's second studio album The Last In Line is a really strong album, full of heavy and hard rocking songs that draw upon the fantasy lyrics for which the band is remembered, lots of guitar solos and of course, Ronnie James Dio's distinctive and unique voice.<br /><br />If you've heard Holy Diver and are wondering where to explore next, The Last In Line should definitely be considered for your next step.<br /><br />The line up on the album is the same as that on Holy Diver (Dio, Campbell, Bain, Appice) only with the addition of Keyboarder Claude Schnell, who brings a different feel to the keyboards which would gradually become more prominent with subsequent releases.<br /><br />The album begins, as with all the first four Dio albums, with a fast and energetic opener that is followed by a considered and mid paced title track. The rest of the album is a mixture of hard and heavy material (Breathless, Evil Eyes) speedy numbers (I Speed At Night) and some more commercial melodic moments (Mystery)<br /><br />As usual with Dio, you get great performances and top notch musicianship (Vivian Campbell in particualr deserves special mention on this album), plenty of memorable riffs and choruses, a fair production job and a bunch of lyrical references to Rainbows. Put simply, if you enjoyed anything else Dio has done, you will enjoy this too.<br /><br />Put simply The Last In Line is a fantastic album, up there with the very best Dio material and well worth buying if you haven't already.
B0001RVTXO|5.0|I don't have much to add. The Pixies are an awesome band and this is a nice representative sampling of their work. It's pretty easy to hear their influence in a lot of popular bands that came after them, namely Nirvana.
B0011Z8SHK|5.0|Deep Purple's sixth studio album (and the third with their famous MKII line Up) Machine Head is their most famous and arguably most loved album, contains many of the band's most famous songs and is considered both an all time classic of rock music and one of the key building blocks of heavy metal... the album held in very high esteem and with good reason.<br /><br />The album set a new standard for rock music, it is full of very memorable songs, most of which the band play live a great deal and all of which are of the utmost quality, most with riveting performances both vocally and instrumentally.<br /><br />Opening up with fan favourite `Highway Star,' the album starts off strong, showcasing its rock credentials right from the beginning. Rithchie Blackmore and Jon Lord had always been talented virtuosic players, but the trade-off keyboard/neo-classical guitar solo on this song was a whole other level of skill and quality. The song just has a great attitude, with driving bass, great drum fills all throughout and a strong chorus.<br /><br />`Pictures Of Home,' is similar in its heavy and driving nature, one of the best songs on the album and this time providing as much of a showcase for Ian Paice's drumming as Lord and Blackmore's soloing. Add to that `Space Trucking,' which is equally strong, driving and rocking and you should be getting a picture for why the album is considered so good.<br /><br />The only two tracks on the album which aren't famous in their own right are `Maybe I'm A Leo,' and `Never Before,' but each fit perfectly on the album, full of the same sort of musicianship as the rest of the album.<br /><br />Of course, the album finishes with absolute classics `Smoke On The Water,' and `Lazy,' two songs you can't go to a Deep Purple concert without hearing and which spend a huge amount of time on classic rock radio programming. No need for me to describe them, you've more than likely heard them already.<br /><br />Overall, Machine Head is the go to album for people getting into Deep Purple, an indisputable classic album and the home of much of the band's best known works. Highly Recommended.<br /><br />If you get the 25th Anniversary edition, in addition to two remixes and one of the best linear note booklets ever made, you'll find the track `When A Blind Man Cries,' which you really ought to hear if you like Deep Purple.utable classic album and the home of much of the band's best known works.

B00122OULK|4.0|Dio's fourth album Dream Evil is the last studio album to feature Claude Schnell and the first to feature gutiarist Craig Goldy (previously of Rough Cutt, but not at the same time as Claude.) Craig ably and deftly handles guitar duties and although his style is slightly different to previous guitarist Vivian Campbell, fits into the overall Dio sound perfectly.<br /><br />Dream Evil is a bit of an interesting one, in that some fans say it isn't as good as the first three (or two in some cases) albums and some say that it is great and the last good Dio album. Personally I find Dream Evil to be everything I want in a Dio album, I think it is strong and well written, I like the general style and the majority of the songs are up there with the best Dio has to offer.<br /><br />I will admit that there are one or two songs that seem a tad weak or generic when listening to the album from beginning to end, but which are fine in isolation. Still, the album contains tracks like 'Sunset Superman,' 'Dream Evil,' and 'All The Fools Sailed Away,' that no right minded Dio fan could ignore, some of the best material the band put out and essential for any best of compilation.<br /><br />The only real problem I can find with Dream Evil is that the production (largely because of the keyboard sound) has dated somewhat, which may be a problem for some fans who only like Dio's harder and heavier material... but the band slowly introduced keyboards more and more over the previous three albums and it just feels like the logical progression here.<br /><br />Another thing that needs pointing out is that Dream Evil isn't some weird departure; with the exception of the scope of keyboard usage, and the introduction of an almost-power-ballad, Dream Evil is stylistically bang on the trademark Dio formula, riffy fast songs mixed with mid paced melodic numbers, soaked in Dio's great voice and guitar solos all over.<br /><br />Guitar solos have always played a big part of Dio's sound and even with a new guitarist on board, Dream Evil does not disappoint in this department. And while guitarist Vivian Campbell was gone, at least spokes-daemon \\"Murray\\" returned for the album's front cover, shame he never took off in quite the same way as Vic Rattlehead, Snaggletooth or Eddie.<br /><br />To summarise; as an album, Dream Evil is worth a place in your collection, it is up there with the best Dio albums, if just shy of being able to be called a contender for best Dio album. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to get into Dio and who has already bought and enjoyed Holy Diver.es not disappoint in this department.

B000005RQT|5.0|Deep Purple In Rock, the band's fourth studio album (and first under the MKII line up of Ian Gillan, Ian Paice, Roger Glover, Jon Lord and Ritichie Blackmore) is one of the all time classic rock albums, streets ahead of its time and full of absolutely classic material.<br /><br />The album starts as it means to go on with energetic opener `Speed King,' a furious and surprisingly heavy song that perfectly illustrates both what the album has still to come and what the MKII Deep Purple line up has to offer. The album is hard, direct and thoroughly captivating throughout, treading the line between reckless energy and expert musicianship really well.<br /><br />Tracks like `Blood Sucker,' `Flight Of The Rat,' and `Living Wreck,' are some of the best rock songs you are likely to hear in your lifetime, and perfectly demonstrate why so many people still love this band, line up and album.<br /><br />In Rock also contains the ten minute moody epic `Child In Time,' which features one of the best vocal performances anyone has ever recorded and which is one of the best Deep Purple songs period.<br /><br />If you have any interest in rock or metal music at all, at some point you really ought to try Deep Purple In Rock. You'll find a very enjoyable listening experience if you do.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|People whine and complain about seeing the same-old, same-old, but then they fail to appreciate a movie like this, which is pure genius.  It's truly an orgasm for the eyes, and I was blown away by it.  Samurai warriors, WW1, steampunk, dragons and orcs, a bomb-laden speeding train, and chicks with big guns.  What's not to like?<br /><br />Seriously, after watching it in the theater and now at home, the camera angles and storyboarding that went into this is impressive.  No, it's not your parents movie.  It's much more.
B000005RRP|5.0|Deep Purple's fifth studio album (and second under the now famous MKII line up) Fireball is an absolute stunner of an album, unfortunately underrated being sandwiched as it is between the classic In Rock and Machine Head albums.<br />For high quality, energetic and interesting rock music, Fireball is a shining example.<br /><br />The album opening title track `Fireball,' is a fast and frantic number with brilliant guitar and keyboard soloing from Ritchie Blackmore and Jon Lord, and a great drum performance from Ian Paice, overall one of the best songs in the band's repertoire.<br /><br />The album is more varied than its predecessor, investigating various territories, from proggier numbers like `Fools,' to the almost country `No One's Daughter,' and the almost psychedelic drum showpiece `The Mule.' Perhaps this variety is the reason the album wasn't as well received as the focused and direct In Rock album, but it definitely adds to the overall experience in hindsight as the band couldn't simply retread old ground anyway.<br /><br />Stand Out tracks include the aforementioned title track and `Fools,' as well as the rocking `No One Came,' which ends the original album really well.<br /><br />If you like Deep Purple you will definitely want to try out Fireball, a fine album indeed and more than worthy of a place in your collection.<br /><br />The 25th anniversary edition expands on the original with a detailed set of linear notes about the making of the album, some remixes and alternative takes as well as the inclusion of single `Strange Kind Of Woman,' and the very enjoyable album outtakes `I'm Alone,' `Freedom,' and `Slow Train,' all of which expand on the album's rock side.
B0039208QM|3.0|Not a stellar effort from an audio / video perspective but still much better quality than the dvd version.  A good version of the Batman lineup but not as good as Batman & Robin in reard to the bluray transfer.  The best they could do with what they had to work with - an old print showing signs of age but a fun movie nonetheless.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|If you like good, wholesome family entertainment and incredible songs that focus on high school teens with a positive message, this is the movie for you.  As long as you're willing to invoke the \\"temporary suspension of disbelief\\" (just go with the flow and enjoy the movie)... you'll be glad that you did.  This movie is proof that when brilliant casting meets talented actors and top-notch music and lyrics, you will definitely get a hit!  If you've seen any of these actors in their other Disney roles, prepare yourself for a whole new experience as you get to see a different side... one that showcases their musical talents.  The lyrics speak to teens and the music is addicting, so get ready to play this one over and over again... just like you would if you were a kid.  There is no age limit to enjoying this movie.  BTW, if you ARE a kid, just tell your parents to buy this one, \\"...because all the cool parents are doing it.\\"
B000OCY7JE|5.0|Great acting by all, love all the characters and the story, a real love story.  Watching the deleted scenes and listening to the director interview really fills in the whole story and adds to the character motives.  I enjoyed the spoken Danish.  I'll enjoy watching it many times.
B00008CMR6|5.0|My husband is a big John Wayne fan and I couldn't find this DVD in any of the stores.  My daughter told me to try amazon.com, and sure enough there it was along with several other John Wayne items. I was surprised at how fast my order came.  We went on vacation, first one in 40 years of marriage, and I wanted to take movies with me so my husband wouldn't be bored, and my order came 2 days before we left.   I'll will be dealing again with your company. Thank you again for all your help.
0425241505|5.0|Nalini Singh is my favorite author when she posted this author on her website i had to try and boy was i surprised. Now i have a new author to read. She is funny and has lots of story line going. Never gets boring. Love love this author thanks nalini singh for this advice.
0060920084|5.0|I purchased this based on a friend's recommendation even though several people claim the book is full of complaining. This book is actually really entertaining, I found the small towns he traveled to to be interesting and some gave me a good laugh. There are few small towns in my own state and this book definitely reminded me of them. I think anyone who has traveled by car can sympathize with boring landscapes and getting lost using a road map. I really like how he describes the people and places in this book, and I am looking forward to reading his other books.
0439023513|1.0|This book ruined the series for me - I had to drag my way through it.  The author didn't maintain the integrity of her characters, the pace was dreadful, and the ending abrupt.  I loved, loved the first one - so sad that this one left such a bad taste in my mouth.  I will have trouble recommending the series to anyone because of it.
B0054JURZA|2.0|I've listened to this recording 3 times now all the way through, and I believe this is a necessary practice for anyone trying to really let a full recording sink in.  I think my conclusion is that this recording is truly not worthy of all it's praise on so many levels.  The only reason I give is two stars is because I do find a lot of the melodies beautiful and some of the arrangements interesting.    My main problems are with production, song lyrics, and in general a frustrating aspect of hype surrounding this record, of which I know has nothing really to do with the music, but has now affected my experience with this record whether I like it or not.    Regarding the lyrics:  After the third listen through, I realized that I had no idea what he was talking about because the lyrics are so hard to hear. I really have no idea what about 8 of the 10 songs are about!?!  I'm having a hard time feeling any sort of real emotion from these songs, because all of the lyrics are masked and hidden under pro tools and digital editing.  I notice that a lot of the song titles are of places, which seems like a lazy and played out thing unto itself.  (I can think of 4 or 5 records of the past 15 years that have done this) When I finish listening to this record I feel almost numb because I have no idea what real grounded emotion is behind any of it.      The production lacks air and space and doesn't seem to really compliment the music often.  It gives the listener almost no time to feel the humanity behind the performances.  Most of the time, the vocals sound like synthesizers, which could be cool if used well, but without clarity of the lyric and of the emotion of the moment, it feels hollow.  The layered textures lack real world air and it all ends up sounding hollow, or like digital bees are buzzing in your ear.  It's a shame, because there is a lot of beautiful instrumentation and music happening in there.    Honestly, much of this record sounds like Bon Iver all of the sudden got carried away with the computer and decided that the soundscapes Sting explored for most of his solo career were going to be cool.  Is this supposed to be ironic?  Is it done as an attempt to make it cool, just for the sake of it?  I just don't think Sting will ever be ironic or cool....  Why is irony cool anyway?  Let's move on already.    I'm confused.  The one thing I can say wholeheartedly is that is seems like at every turn, things were done on the basis of style and aesthetic.  For me, it lacks humanity, understandable emotion, grounded-ness....and quite frankly.....soul.    The frustrating thing for me, is that I suspect the soul is in there, but it gets lost in the grandiose arrangements and production and autotune.  Or maybe it's masked because it's actually hollow and there isn't any real substance in there?  I wish I knew.  If only I could hear the lyrics.
B004132I4S|5.0|I found the music contained within this recording to be instantly intriguing. The sounds & sound textures were completely new to me. But because it can seem like such an assault on the senses I can only listen to a few songs at a time. If you are unfamiliar with this artist, as I was, I would caution you to listen to the selections on this website. The songs may seem repetitious but there are enough variations to make each piece unique. Because personal taste in anything can & should never be \\"rated\\", I'm giving this CD \\"5 stars\\" because the production is first rate.
1444710338|5.0|The purchase thru Amazon.com was simple and reasonable. We looked for this book and found it at a fair price without any trouble. If we had any criticism it would be that it was not too apparent that the book was being shipped from outside the US, requiring a longer lead time. As it was it was still received prior to the suggested date.
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the movie, but was not satisfied with the service I received. It came in a cd case and it didn't say that on the details.
B000NY12LO|4.0|I'll admit I had no idea going into this book, that it was going to be about a high school shooting.  Honestly, still being a student (although in college), I may not have picked up this book knowing that.  There are some truly emotional moments brought forth in this book, not just through the shooting & the victims, but the battle between doing what's right, and what will make you stay in the \\"in crowd.\\"  The story is set up beautifully, bouncing back and forth between years and months leading up to the tragic event, to the aftermath of the victims and the trial, slowly adding in pieces that build the story, and put the puzzle pieces together.<br />It is a gripping book and definitely will keep you reading.  The ending was the only thing I was not thrilled about, although, I admit I was expecting it.<br /> Be warned that there are graphic moments, including not only the violence of the shooting & descriptions of the crime scene, but also some teen sex moments. That said, this is an excellent book to strike up discussion about the possibilities of school shootings & the sadness and destruction brought in the aftermath.  It also brings to light the possible effects brought on by bullying.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend.

B0025UHKNS|2.0|First of all the software bundled was terrible and garmin online is just about as bad.    Secondly, the battery life on this unit was only about a day before it was dead.  I am assuming here it was defective, so I sent it back.  Didn't want to take another chance, switched to Polar CS series for my cycling needs.    If your battery is not defective, then overall the watch has a great set of features with built in GPS.  Touch bezel is an awesome idea to incorporate.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|What a horrible product!  I bought these from Verizon with an iphone.  What a mistake!  On an absolutely new, clean iphone it left more bubbles than a bubble bath.  Also, the feel of the film was horrible.  The resistance to finger movement was orders of magnitude greater than the glass itself.  I had a protective film on my droid, which was a thousand times better than this product.  If you are thinking about buying this product, throw you money out the car window instead.  It will be better spent.
1441869980|4.0|Courtesy of Lost Art Audiobook Review    This audiobook was not what I expected.  I expected a story about a druid to be another Lord of the Rings-type, high fantasy, Renaissance Faire-like, tight-wearing tale. It's not. It's very modern, very urban fantasy, incorporating the real world, the real police, including jurisdictional and media concerns.  Tempe versus Phoenix cops?  Can't go to the hospital because of the paperwork that requires? Check and check.  I really appreciate that real world consideration.  It makes the cynic in me happy.      Also, having first read the official blurb on the book, I was worried about how many different supernatural creatures are in the story: werewolves and vampires and witches and fae and Norse gods and miscellaneous demons, oh my!  Usually, with that many different paranormal types, the reader starts to trip up over the storyline.  Here, it worked because the focus remained on the fae.  Atticus is the old Druid, and his power is very witchy and similar to the Coven, which makes it easier on the reader.  With the lawyers - the vampire and werewolves - these characters are ancillary enough not to complicate things.  The only trip-up I found was with Granuaile MacTiernan. When we find out what's up with her, I did roll my eyes.  It was really just a tad bit too much.   Overall, Hounded was a joy to listen to.  The writing itself is very skillful and conversational.  The tension is there continually, and it builds easily from setting to setting.  I enjoyed learning with Atticus which characters he could trust and which he should fear.  There are some very sexy moments, although the writing is PG-13.  Also, there's a ton of humor in this audiobook, especially from the wolfhound, who's obsessed with Genghas Khan and French poodles, and Atticus's old neighbor, who hates the British and drinks like a fish.     On narration:  Luke Daniels does not sound like a 21-year-old, but he sure does sound like he knows Celtic.  His pronunciationof old Irish names is spot-on.  When he narrates Oberon, he sounds like a big, loveable, fuzzy, panting hound. When he reads female voices, he doesn't pitch his voice up high, but he makes his tone softer and breathier, which definitely works as most females in Hounded are sexual.  His accents, specifically Polish and Hindi, worked.  Overall, the reading went well with the story.
B004GYOQ6A|2.0|works fine (droid X) but the levels are not interestingly creative... they seem to have just been churned out.  the physics is also a bit off... the holes suck the balls in when you can pass closer in real life.
0307595862|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the Larsson trilogy - the parts with Lisbeth, that is. The other characters did not hold a candle to her. Now imagine a book where all the characters are as brilliantly written as Lisbeth, and you have The Snowman.  The book moves at a good clip, with a just-right combination of character development, Scandinavian atmosphere, creepy foreboding, and great action. I also enjoyed how the author fooled me with the plot twists, just as the killer did to Harry Hole. As a reader, I was a step or two behind Harry all the way, rushing to keep up. That is much more satisfying than figuring it all out halfway through a mystery novel. This author keeps you on your toes and whets your appetite for more. I hope all the Harry Hole novels are translated into English!
B002RKSZN0|1.0|This book is not good at all. I usually have no problem getting into a story, no matter what period it is written from, but the Author rambled on & on for the first 15 or so pages, that I finally gave up on reading anymore. The story line was not very strong at all, therefore it did not get much of my attenton.
B001HN6922|3.0|My family and I were eager to see Car 2 in the theater, especially my son and I.<br /><br />The plot? A bunch of lemons take ownership of a secret oil reserves in the ocean--and they want revenge on the \\"pretty\\" cars that never break down.<br /><br />It's a weak premise, and lacks the heart of the original Cars (which stemmed from John Lasseter's very personal \\"aha\\" moment involving a road trip and the realization of the importance of friends and family).<br /><br />I didn't care about any of the new characters in Cars 2, which are basically James Bond-type spies. Sure, there's some amusing moments and brief visits with the original cast members (Lizzie, Sarge, Red, Fillmore, etc.), but they are VERY small portions of the movie.<br /><br />There is TONS of action in Cars 2--too much, really. It made me dizzy. Lots of gunfire and explosions, making me VERY surprised that it's rated G (it should have been PG). It felt like a movie made for young boys...and the Dads that would take them to see it.<br /><br />My son enjoyed it, but he loves all Pixar movies. My husband and I weren't very impressed with this one. Even the \\"short\\" at the begining (a Toy Story short I can't even remember) was...well, forgettable.<br /><br />If you like car chases, spy stuff and tons of explosions, you may like this movie. If you're expecting the relaxed pace and heart of the first Cars, you'll likely be very disappointed. It feels like a Fourth of July shoot-em-up blockbuster--and it would appear that was exactly the intent of the filmmakers.<br /><br />You're better off waiting for Cars 2 to come out on DVD as a renter, rather than spend the $ seeing in the theaters or buying the DVD without first viewing Cars 2.<br /><br />-- Janet Boyer, author of lots of stuff
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|First off, let me get something out of the way.  I HATE Creed.  Hate them.  Hate everything about them.  I hate their boring inane music, their annoying, cloying stupid guitar melodies, I hate their stupid, obnoxious, overwrought, religion-laden lyrics, and most of all, I hate Scott Stapp's annoying as ______, Eddie-Vedder clone, ______ sounding vocals.  Indeed, I put them as one of the bands that was Creed deserves to be mentioned with derision along the lines of Nickelback, Puddle of Mud, Crossfade, and Saving Abel when it comes to bland modern radio rawk; only Bush gets my vote for being worse in the long line of ________, bland, Seattle-lite (that's an understatement if there ever was one) radio rawk.<br /><br />Alter Bridge, however, is amazing.  I admit it, I had not heard of Alter Bridge before and there would have been a great chance that I would have just brushed them off like I would any other modern rock band.  Given the fact that I have no interest to radio rock and could care less about what the remembers of one of the worst rock bands of the late 90's, the was pretty much moot.  However, I couldn't resist some of the hype lauded upon this band (especially concerning Myles Kennedy) and I gave in and listened.  Let me say that I was completely floored when I first heard Isolation.  What was this song?  These guitar riffs.  And was there really a singer belting out soaring that recall Chris Cornell.  I never was more mad at myself, but I learned.<br /><br />Alter Bridge's first album, actually wasn't that bad of an album, but it had some traits of Creed's dull songwriting, and the band felt like they were getting warmed up their other influences and trying to shrug off their remains of Creed.  With this album, their sound really clicked and expanded (although the next release, AB III, would expand even more)  even better is that the band made a deliberate and conscious desire to move away from the dull songwriting of Creed.  What a difference that made.  No, Alter Bridge is not the most original band in the universe or anything, but this band has taken great strides to expand their sound.  Tremonti and Myles unleashed awesome guitar riffs, light and delicate guitar picking, some dark acoustic guitar playing, searing SRV guitar licks and leads, and some blazing solos with FEELING, all in Tremonti's distinct, warm guitar tone.  The rhythm section is also excellent, and provides the rhythm and the beat, the life, of the music, with ease.<br /><br />What's actually most surprising about this record is how Mark Tremonti has shown why he's actually a very skilled and revered guitarist, even though he played with such a derided band like Creed.  So much for first impressions.  Here, his guitar playing finally comes through, and it's damn impressive.  Crushing guitar riffs and power chords (although I think he's moved past the latter), solos that are more than just flashy, and much more.  Myles Kennedy is also no slouch either, actually; he's actually rather accomplished guitarist, from what I heard, he can play some insane jazz.  This dual guitar attack and freedom from the confines of ________ music like Creed (all of the members of this band actually have pretty good musical inspiration, from SRV to Led Zeppelin to Soundgarden and Jeff Buckley) really pushes the band in strides and makes their music much more interesting and powerful.<br /><br />However, if you haven't been paying attention, Myles Kennedy is the main difference from Scott Stapp, and one of the biggest reasons for Alter Bridge's musical .  Myles, in some circles, is even being touted as one of the best rock singers since Jeff Buckley, and even Robert Plant.  While I think the latter's a bit of a stretch, his voice is still amazing.  Maybe it's the four/three (i hear people say he has one or the other) octave vocal range, or a voice that has the emotion of Robert Plant, the range of Chris Cornell (although I know being a baritone he has better lows, but his high notes are not as clean or high as Myles), and the soaring beauty of Jeff Buckley, this Myles Kennedy guy is no fluke.  He's easily becoming on my favorite singers in the business, and since Cornell will never sound like he did when he did when with Soundgarden (just listen to Audioslave live in Cuba, godawful), an easy top dog for best rock singer today. Nobody sounds like him either, which makes him even more unique and hard to find these days.<br /><br />In addition, Alter Bridge writes lyrics that are positive, assertive, and urge listeners to take control of their life, but at the same time avoiding the typical focus-group candy bull_______ in the hands of a paid hack-professional songwriter.  They aren't ground breaking, but there's no doubting their authenticity and assertiveness when they sing.  I also like their direct approach to the lyrics, proving that the message is much more effective when you don't beat around the bush, instead of having a lot of self-fun with a thesaurus.  Aside from the great music, the lyrics make their songs all the more assertive and fresh, making today's modern radio rawk even more contrived and laughable than it already is.<br /><br />Every song here is great, with excellent guitar work from both Myles and Tremonti, and a tight, dynamic rhythm section.  The albums' centerpiece is the title track, and while it's a bit over hyped (in a recent poll, the guitar solo(s) won a poll by a large margin for best guitar solo of all time, beating out such guitarists as Van Halen, Hendrix, Page, Gilmour, and Petrucci.  Ehhhh......), it's a terrific song.  Other highlights include Buried Alive (with a KILLER chorus), the anthemic Rise Today, the frantic Ties that Bind that recalls Rusty Cage in a way (when listening to the music, you can almost see the narrator thrashing against imprisonment, trying to get free), and the beautiful Before Tomorrow Comes.  Really, the whole album is excellent from top to bottom.<br /><br />Indeed, this is a great album, classic even.  Their follow up, AB III is even more developed in terms of songwriting, as well as darker in lyrical content.  I think the future of this band is very bright as well, and the fact that their last two albums have both suffered from poor marketing and low commercial success, is, in my opinion, even better.  I'm not ready to call this band the best hard rock band of the decade or anything, but it doesn't matter much.  I think Alter Bridge sits just fine with the likes of The Mars Volta and Queens of the Stone Age when it comes to 21st century hard rock.  Creed can't hold _____ to this band, don't listen to the detractors on this one.  Trust me.  Alter Bridge is here to stay.high as Myles), and the soaring beauty of Jeff Buckley, this Myles Kennedy guy is no fluke.

B003XQRZ7E|5.0|From beggining to end a great rock album. From the opening title track hughes come's out like a rock n' roll preacher screaming I am a messenger & this is my prophecy! then one last soul has great hook & chorus with great guitar work by joe. Song of yesterday i think is the highlight of this album very smooth & Textured while joe & glen balance one of the best duet's i think i've ever heard. Then sweet sister jane with ripping guitar riff's that sound like a lost ac/dc tune.And Jason Bonham on drum's seem's very strong & well played i think his father would be very proud of the work jason has done on this album.If you like ac/dc zeppelin deep purple & great guitar work this is the rock album you need to get.
B001QWBM62|4.0|As a professional (still) photographer I've found myself being pushed into video more and more often. Not satisfied with the sound quality afforded by the onboard sound of my DSLR or Go Pros I wanted a dedicated device. After seeing one of the major Hollywood sound studios using this device for field recoding race cars (although they were using some tiny microphones that cost more than the H4n) I decided to get one myself.    My first time using the H4N to get on board sound in a race car I set the recording volume on the H4N  to the absolute minimum as the car I was recording was significantly louder than a modern NASCAR car. That turned out to be way too low, but because I used the best sound quality (96 hz frequency, and 24 bit depth) I was able to pull up the sound in Adobe Soundbooth. Much like rescuing a poorly exposed photograph that was shot in RAW, the audio recovered from that \\"messed up\\" recording far surpassed the audio from a GoPro or DSLR. That alone proved to me this was a great purchase.    Going from recording the race cars (with the recording volume turned way down), I went to the other end of the spectrum and with the recording volume all the way up used it to finally get some good recordings of  my cats purring - something I haven't been able to achieve before.    Besides figuring out what recording levels to use (difficult since I can't be in the car at speed and I don't want to use the auto level since the volume can change extremely rapidly) the other thing that has taken some getting used to is the two button press that is required to start recording. Press rec once and you beginning monitoring the sound the second press (or pressing play) begins the recording. I've not recoded a couple of things I meant to, but since I decided to start using play instead of pressing record a second time I haven't missed one (I now think of record as stand by and play to begin the recording). Despite how complicated all of the buttons etc look I have found them to be VERY intuitive to use and have had to refer to the manual on very few occasions.     The biggest negative for me, on the H4n is that the tripod socket is too shallow. It needs to be 50% deeper to match the depth of most camera sockets. As it is, I worry about bottoming out the tripod screw and stripping the socket threads on the H4N every time I mount the H4n using the tripod socket (which I use a lot when mounting in cars). The socket also protrudes slightly from the body making it difficult for the tripod plate to make contact with the body of the H4n which means a bit of vibration and the H4N will begin to unscrew itself from the tripod mount. I would recommend a thin rubber or cork washer (1/32 - 1/16 thick depending on the length of the tripod screw) to help solve both of these problems.    Pros  Well built  Great sound quality  TONS of features beyond just recording (mentronome instrument tuning)  Intuitive controls (apart from two button press to begin recoding but I'm getting the hang of it  External mic and Hi-z / XLR inputs  And many, many more (see product description for a list of the cool features)    Cons  Tripod mount  Load time takes a few (10-15) seconds each time you turn on the device    All in all I would give it 4.5 out of 5 stars. The negatives are quite minor and the good stuff is great.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I mainly bought this because it was 99 cents, but overall the album is just.. okay. I don't hate it, but i certainly don't love it. Gaga didn't do anything really spectacular on this album.
B00004STOZ|4.0|I love the music; love the composer - got stacks.  However, there is something very odd going on here!  When playing this CD on my computer I noticed that the playlist states that the playing is done by Glenn Gould - I have nothing against Gould,  the \\"Marlon Brando of the keyboard\\"; I have lots of his brilliant performances but this ECM disc states that this particular performance is by Keith Jarrett - labels front, back and sides make this clear.  Is this a typo, a slip-up or a scam?.  The actual disc label says Jarrett, the displayed content says Gould!  Some little semi-cynical voice inside me gives me the idea that this is by Gould but labelled Jarrett, because it was cut in 1990 when computers could not play CDs and it perhaps it was thought that this little pea and thimble trick would never be noticed on a regular CD player, since they do not have detailed displays of tracks.  Could someone out there scratch this itch for me and help me out?  The music is great, but is this a false sale and should we all get our money back?  I don't get it - what gives?
B0057AOOZ0|4.0|I enjoyed the album but not nearly as much as previous ones. Most of Beyonce's albums I enjoy every single song on it and if not I grow to love all of them. With this album, I've gotten to the point where I enjoy some songs and skip over others.
1594202842|2.0|I read Battle Hymn with a lot of interest.  There's something horribly fascinating about weird families and obsessive people.  And the book WAS funny sometimes.  There are some redeeming parts to it: Chua obviously loves her daughters very, very much and she did what seemed the right thing for them.  And who knows, some kids might actually NEED that kind of discipline in order to get ahead.    Plus, this was written as a self-parody and I have no idea what Chua is actually like in real life.  This is a criticism of Chua as a character in her book, not a real person.    I was, to be blunt, very disturbed by this book.  What kind of parent shoves back the cards her little daughters made for her birthday, saying, \\"I deserve better than these.  So I REJECT these.\\"  And then she congratulates herself on the oh so much better cards her daughters gave her then, citing this as proof that her \\"Chinese discipline\\" is working.  She doesn't see that, given how she's been treating her girls, she's lucky she's getting ANY cards from them.      The girls often don't come across as so very gifted, but, rather, as too cowed to refuse.  Chua's methods are vicious, and her blanket condemnation of \\"Western parenting\\" borders on racist.  A single word keeps coming up in this memoir on parenting: \\"I.\\"  \\"I\\" and \\"me.\\"  This is not about her daughters, nor is it a true reflection on what she did right and wrong, or even a memoir of Chinese child-raising.  This is a narcissistic screed all about how great Amy Chua is and how stupid everyone else is.    Amy Chua comes across as a rather disturbed person herself.  There is a strange desperation to the way she keeps frantically saying, \\"Chinese do this;\\" \\"Chinese do that;\\" \\"I'm Chinese, I'm Chinese, I'M CHINESE!!!\\"  She seems desperate to cling to her fantasy of what a Chinese person and a Chinese mother is, while refusing to acknowledge that she is, in fact, barely Chinese at all.  In one of the few really lucid moments of the book, when Sophie points out that no one, not the Chinese and not the Americans, thinks that she is Chinese, Chua reflects that Sophie might be right, but still says firmly, \\"You're Chinese.\\"  She ignores any evidence that she is other than her own image of herself; if she is given proof that she or her daughters are not Chinese, she does the equivalent of closing her eyes and humming very loudly like stuffing her fingers in her ears. Chua shows very little knowledge of Chinese culture; for instance, she ignores that a lot of Chinese do not espouse her crazed child-rearing methods and does not even mention the nastier aspects of traditional Chinese culture.  Little things like spoiling your sons rotten while leaving your daughters in the cesspit because they are, quite literally, garbage.  Not great parenting, people.      If you read the book closely, you can see Chua comes from a family with a history of abuse--or, at least, it's unconsciously portrayed that way (like I said, I don't know the Chuas).  Her own father refuses to even speak to his own mother because of the abusive way she raised him, and even Chua has to admit that the \\"Chinese method\\" failed miserably there.  But that didn't stop Mr. Chua from inflicting that method upon his children, and it didn't stop Chua herself from doing the same.  Chua claims that she suffered no ill effects whatsoever from her \\"tough\\" upbringing, but her book doesn't bear that out.  Chua comes across as both blindly arrogant and deeply insecure, clinging to her fantasies and rigid rules in order to keep her head above her own churning ocean of fears.  She admits that she is unable to have fun, unable to enjoy life, unable to relax, unable to stop driving herself and everyone around her past their limits.  She describes herself--accurately--as \\"compulsively cruel.\\"  She is unable to be creative or orginal, wanting only \\"to write down what the professor said.\\"  Only someone who is deeply unhappy and dissatisfied with her own life would live vicariously through their children to such a degree.  She frantically condemns \\"losers\\" in order to convince herself that she is one of the winners.  She also seems incredibly childish, throwing a tantrum every time things don't go her way, or veer out of her narrow concept of what is good and what is right (even if the rice bag explodes).  She is unable to deal with any opposition in a mature or adult way, even from her husband.  In short, she does not come across as someone who was strengthened by her tough upbringing, but someone who was crippled by it.     One reason I think the book generated so much controversy is not just Chua's personality, but the way she plays to the fantasy that, if we're just strict enough with our kids, nothing bad will ever happen to them.  If we just take them to enough classes--yell at them enough--make them practice enough piano--make them get good grades--not only will they be successful, rich, upstanding members of society, but they will all have happy marriages, beautiful kids and perfect health.  Forever!  They will never be in car crashes, never contract cancer, never be laid off, never have any bad luck.  Their lives will be as perfect as their test scores!    Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.  Chua herself learns this when her smart, successful sister still contracts leukemia.  Chua is shocked that this could happen to \\"my lucky family,\\" and is obviously very shaken.  After all, didn't her sister get good grades?  Shouldn't she be immune from disease?  But she isn't, and neither is Chua, or her daughters.  Bad things happen even to the smartest person.    Case in point: Chua herself.  She may have been trying to show herself as a tough, rational person with strict parenting methods and high expectations, but she comes across as a braying narcissist with serious self-esteem issues.
B0019NB9A2|2.0|The blu ray version is barely superior to the DVD...it is very grainy.<br /><br />Not worth the upgrade.
B001FBWVDM|4.0|This is a nice, but rather bizarre box set from the Coop. It features 4 discs of personal favorites of Alice, and quite a few rare gems that had not been released before, or where only available on certain releases that some fans had trouble tracking down.     On disc one is a combination of songs from early Alice Cooper, so early they where not called the Alice Cooper group yet, they where the Spiders and The Nazz, and features a few rarer to find songs, as well as some songs that where only heard on bootlegs, but have been digitally remastered for better quality here. It's interesting to hear how this group went from something like a 60's psychedelic acid tripping band trying to find a sound, to the hard rock monsters they became. Continuing on, they may just look like greatest hits being thrown in, and some are, with reason in the booklet why Alice has included the song, and a story to go with it, like maybe how it came about, what it's about, or who helped to make it. But then there is a couple of songs that are the single release version, these songs may sound just the same to some people, but real fans can hear the differences between them, some may just be snippets from the last track missing, or something shortened here and there, but it's nice to actually have all these things if you are a collector.    Disc two is mostly the hits again, but there is a few demo and studio versions of a few songs.     Disc 3, has a few more hits, a few more demos and a couple of unreleased songs, such as Hard Rock Summer In The USA, which could only be heard in the movie Friday The 13th: Part 6: Jason Lives. Finally it has been released, and was one of the biggest reasons I picked up this box set.    Disc 4: This was the most interesting disc to me, having demo and movie mix versions of \\"He's Back, The Man Behind the Mask\\", written for the movie I just mentioned. It was a real surprise to hear the original version, and how the song changed so much. Tho, do note; Amazon has \\"Is Anyone Home\\" listed as a live version, it is not, it is the same track found on \\"A Fistful of Alice\\"    So, that is what's on the box set, but I can't give this thing the perfect 5 stars. For what is on here, is great, but I think this would have been so much more appreciated if there was not so many regular hit songs included, and just stuck purely to demo, alternate versions, studio version and outtakes. The entire bonus CD that came with \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" should not have been held off for a separate release, and instead included here in this one. Even if it would reduce the numbers of discs to 2 or 3, it would have been much more of a worthy purchase for Alice fans. Why did they feel including songs we already own and love in the mix of what we will be skipping to to check out should be included? It's the mystery of the box sets like these, like when AC/DC released Bonfire in 1997 and included the album Back In Black... sure, it may have been the ultimate tribute album to Bon Scott's memory, but in retrospect, it is one of, and possibly will be the highest selling album of all time, which means WE ALREADY OWN IT! We don't need more copies of the album.     Something I did enjoy about the regular hits and tracks on this Box Set was the songs from the 80's between Clones and Raise Your Fist. For some reason, Alice hasn't digitally remastered those albums, so it is good to hear them here mastered and sounding better then they do on the albums. Especially songs from Constrictor. Compared to the asking price that was first laid on when this was first released, it's not a bad price. Fans will enjoy the demos and outtakes and what not, and maybe new fans might get a taste of Alice's progression through the years, and you could maybe call this a kind of Greatest Hits box set, but fans would debate it and say a million other songs should be included then, it's pretty much a see what's on it box set, if you like the sound of it, get it.    However, don't mistake this as a greatest hits box set. It's far from it; this is more or less a treat from Alice as he has picked HIS favorite songs it seems, so don't go complaining that a particular song hasn't been included. Plus a few rarities thrown into the mix as well. 3 great songs from the pre Alice days when they where called the Spiders. Plus a cool unreleased track from the Nazz.    I have really enjoyed the songs I had not heard before that have been included into this, the single versions, demos, ECT... but for the fans of Alice who already have the songs that are on the released albums, plus the ones I already had from various other stuff (imports/greatest hits) you can be left feeling like you would like more.    For the Cooper fan, they probably already had all of this stuff. But it's nice to have them officially released. A highlight is hearing the original demo version of He's Back (man behind the mask) from the 86 Constrictor album. The song was originally the music that became \\"Trick Bag\\" and it's a mind blow to hear it that way.    Overall, I'm not sure who to recommend this to? The hardcore Alice fan might want it if there is enough on it they don't already have, but they may feel its not worth it cause they do have it all. Someone new wanting to be introduced to Alice may love it. Hearing Alice from the beginning to pretty much mid 90's.    Alice may not be every ones choice of music, but that's because Alice Cooper has been so mistreated by the press, opinions, reputation, stories and all that trash they print and lie about. But listening to this from start to finish reminds me that Alice is truly one of the all time greats that is so badly underrated and miss appreciated. It's true that Alice did it all before anyone, made way for the bands to come and changed the face of Rock N Roll. And if those criticizing would just zip it long enough to listen through the 30 years of Alice, there bound to find something they like. Alice has done just about every style of music there is, from slow tempo to orchestrated ballads rock of all forms, country, blues, pop, dance, metal, folk and even done them in every form from original 70's heavy metal to 90's/2000 style metal and back again. If its worth doing, Alice did it, if it wasn't worth doing, Alice did it, if anyone can make something sound good, Alice has done it. And that comes across clearly in this box set of gems from the world's most underrated songwriter.
0385738757|5.0|The Scorch Trials, was an enthralling, heart-pounding, page turner that I absolutely consumed. James Dasher seems to have a penchant for writing suspenseful and action packed novels. This novel starts off almost exactly where The Maze Runner left off and though the books are part of a series each had their stark differences.<br /> Immediately we are thrown into Thomas's world where questions go unanswered and doubt and fear plague him constantly. Dasher really takes the reader into Thomas's mind brilliantly with limited third person narrative, that allows us to only know as much as Thomas does and quite frankly, it's a bit maddening. In this way Dasher really forces us to identify with Thomas and honestly feel his pain.<br /> The Maze is over, complete, and finished and so the Gladers have relaxed and started to dream about their future, but little do they know what the future indeed holds for them is The Scorch Trials. That's right, even though they thought their nightmares were over it turns out they are still smack in the middle of it. The novel rolls on with action scene after action scene playing out beautifully as Dasher so well executes his images on paper.<br /> Yes, The Maze has ended but the truth isn't much better. The earth has been scorched by sun flares and a terrible disease, the Flare, is consuming humanity turning people into Cranks which have quite a zombie-esque quality. These Cranks have some utterly terrifying moments in the book and I am truly grateful to Dasher for scarring the pants off of me. The book was a page turner and extremely hard to put down and I thank the constant change of scenery and different character interactions for helping that along.<br /> Dasher is not afraid to go to the place that lets us see what human beings are really capable of when faced with catastrophe. Murder and salvation sometimes are mulled over and sometimes are quick and snap decisions. Every emotion is explored through the entirety of the book and it is a hard look at basic human instincts.<br /> While I quite anticipate the final book, The Death Cure, which Dasher has promised will answer many looming questions. I love the feeling that I just might be on to something, though he has given me this feeling before only to take it away and replace it with utter hopelessness. Wouldn't it just be brilliant though, if Dasher was to rip all this away from us only to prove we were the ones on which  W.I.C.K.E.D. was experimenting .basic human instincts.

0143035711|5.0|It is 20 years after the end of the second world war; the theater of operations is dense tropical jungle and the army appears to be convinced the the mobility offered by this entirely new device (choppers entered the turbine age in 1951) would enable them to quickly subdue an agrarian population.    I drive stick (manual transmission) and remember how confusing the degrees of freedom were when I first encountered it. Helicopters take this up several notches, and the author exposes you to them with such smooth compelling insight that it seems less like you are being lectured and more like you are engaged in the most technical bar side conversation you every experienced. Every question I would have prompted was answered in course, and the technical implications of flying these insane contraptions in open combat where young Americans were tossed into entirely alien conditions to fight against guerrilla forces is sheer insanity. Over-laboured device flight strategies, personal strategies for flight patterns that minimized danger, the versatile use of the chopper rotors for what ever situation arises.    The expression \\"'n boer maak 'n plan\\" has found a better hook to hang on.    TL&DR: Felt like a first hand helicopter ride through a hostile Disneyland, with bullets, strong personalities and a glorious sparsity of political weariness
B004WOS7LO|5.0|David Cook released the best album I have ever heard. If you like music...you have to buy this album. Every song on the album is fantastic! His first album was great but this one is just unreal. The songs tell great stories and he goes from a quiet song \\"goodbye to the girl\\" to the rock n roll song \\"Right Here With You\\"....This is a must have. Not for just David Cook fans but for any music fan. He takes music to a whole new level. You have to get this album!!!!!!
0553103547|4.0|This is both about the novel and TV-series.<br /><br />  We experience old men and women, young girls and boys, and everything in-between in a brutal world where everyone can be a victim. There is sex, nudity, boys sucking mother's nipples, girls killing, girls being beaten and crying until they're red in the face, decapitations, really scary walking dead, dragon babies suckling at a woman's breasts and so on. This is a great far cry from «family friendly» stories.<br /><br />  This is daring and truly mature storytelling.<br /><br />  There is a sense of menace right from the start, a mature mood usually not present in many rather childish fantasy novels. We know something bad will happen and that it will rock our world and challenge our perceptions. Characters perceived as main characters may not remain so very long and not be long for the world. Bad people may survive and thrive, and good people may not.<br /><br />  I wasn't initially very excited about the story, since I'm not very interested in what's going on at royal courts and such, but the story is so well crafted and so engaging that I tend to forget my original misgivings.<br /><br />  It's also well translated from novel to film. The few changes are mostly due to insufficient production funds. Large battle scenes, for instance are mostly left out. We only see the result, not what happened. A clear disadvantage to be sure, but not enough to put me off watching the series.<br /><br />  It has a very realistic or at least believable feel to it and I am hooked.<br /><br />  The ending, the revelation of the Dragon is clearly one of the greatest ever.
1416583432|5.0|The Author's credentials speak for themselves, and are perfectly aligned with her analysis and delivery.  Horowitz surveys dog's cognitive abilities and creates a realistic picture of what dogs perceive and how they function.  This mildly scientific book is insightful and balanced, but also has a clever edge, and is therefore easy and enjoyable to read. Having grown up with dogs, and being a dog aficianado, I am pleased to submit that this is the book I have been looking for my entire adult life when it comes to my favorite animal - the dog!  Five stars for Alexandra Horowitz.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I'll be very brief when talking about this movie, given that it's fairly the best one I've ever see and, probably, will ever see.  Firstly, it's photography and soundtrack re awesome, inpiring and fitting the context of the movie perfectly.  By the way, context is the word to describe this movie: with dozens of references to real life, the movie manages to use this to make it even more realistic and touching.  The main point discussed in it is how \\"nothing lasts\\". And, again, the word \\"context\\" shall be remembered: the movies manages to make you FEEL the ephemerallity of life and pass on its message awesomely.  I will never be able to transmit my feeling about this movie with words, so, my only recommendation is buying it, watching it, sleeping with it or doing whatever it pleases you to do with it.  And that is because it is the best film I'll ever see.    \\"You can be mad as a mad dog at the way things went. You can swear, curse the fates. But when it comes to the end, ya gotta let go\\"
0525425578|5.0|Great story for start to finish. We need more books like this for kids that will take them away from the video games.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|This album is a classic & I will enjoy it a decade from now. Sooooo beautiful & musical. I adore every track, especially RATHER DIE YOUNG. I grew up in the 70's & 80's when we heard MELODY on the radio. I pity those people who prefer beats & hooks, because every ballad can be remixed into a club track - versus the rarity of a truly lush ballad or mid - tempo jam. Open you ears & your heart to this lovely album & it will become a comfort and inspiration.
0316098329|5.0|I was drawn in from the beginning and so impressed with the depth of this writing.  I HIGHLY recommend it!
B00005M989|2.0|Hello Everybody in Prince World!!!! I am A huge Prince fanatic but with this release i just don't agree with the very best part. Prince should have at least a 6 box cd set he just don't get the credit he deserves. If u r interested in Prince maybe this is ok to start off with but i strongly suggest u pick up Prince the hits/b-sides.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This game is fantastic! But it crashes on some levels in the Gift Box if you take too long (it seems like the levels with the wheels are the problem). That needs to be fixed! Otherwise this game is five stars. HTC EVO 3D
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely recommend this fantastic book to everyone!  My favorite literature type (right now) seems to be young adult set in a dystopian future.  Mind you, I'm a woman in her (*cough) sixties, so I present to you a mature judgement...  Wowee! Way cool fine readin'!  Be getting all over this one!  Seriously, I loved the whole trilogy, but if trilogies aren't your thing, at least read this first one.
0452282152|5.0|So beautiful in it's simplicity, the way art is viewed... I am very sad that some people didn't experience what I did when reading this book. It may be a little rough around the edges in terms of the 'rules' of writing a novel, but you can tell that this woman poured her soul into this book. No, it's not dark... But a light read. There are too few of those these days. Give yourself a break and read this book.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|So I was thoroughly enjoying this book and then what happened?...It abruptly ended!  I am so annoyed about that.  It only started to get interesting in the last few chapters and then it's over.
0345522478|5.0|Wow, Really excellent book.  I found it to be a light weight, engrossing, at times funny, and really smart.  The Urban Fantasy clich&eacute; of mythic folklore serving as a background to a torrid fetishistic romance novel is really kind of an injustice to books like this.  It's full of rather obscure folklore that is well researched and meticulously rendered.  The characters are fully formed and deceptively easy to fall in love with (The Morrigan, Celtic Goddess of death for example!)  There is an excellent mix of action and dialogue so that there is really never a dull moment.  My personal favorite is the use and reference of obscure pop culture tid bits like the mention of Psychobilly!  Who does that!<br />Anyone who is a fan of Jim Butcher, Patricia Briggs, and Carrie Vaughn will not be disappointed!  One of the most exciting things for me to discover was that Kevin Hearne is a fan of my all time favorite author Patrick Rothfuss, author of Name of the Wind and Wise Man's Fear.  I highly recommend this book as it is a wonderful escape from the monotony of daily existence.  Don't forget to if this review helped you please say so!  Thanks
B0051OZ564|4.0|This is an engaging and artistic film that works on every level. It could fly over the heads of some people who don't understand the artistry and intelligence film because of the very intentional and self aware flash and spectacle that is in the film. Anyone who dismisses this film as a mindless action movie is an idiot. This is a well written, well directed work of cinema that posesses a level of artistic quality that is rare and usually completely absent in hollywood films. This film is a result of an individual's creative vision and not another banal product for the masses.<br />Sucker Punch catches you with a jarring twist at the end that turns out to be a feint and that is part of the genius of the script writing. The film then flows into an ending tone which is great.<br />A very entertaining, as well as a very satisfying movie.<br />Highly recommended. Ignore the low reviews. This is a Solid 4 star movie.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Like the title says, the game is awesome and addicting and fun, but there are ads in the free version that impair your view of the game, going from occasionally hiding a bird or even a bonus item to a \\"pop-up\\" ad that randomly pops up while you're trying to play, causing you to accidentally click on the link and go to their web page (mostly, if not all, for the honda civic.)
0307346617|5.0|Amazing piece of literature. I truly enjoyed reading it, and couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed all the new facets in which zombies could be experienced that I found in this book. Things I never even thought about with relation to zombies were brought to light. I just wish the book was longer than 342 pages so I could keep reading!!!!    Can't wait for the movie to come out in 2014

0765356147|3.0|Sanderson is still trying interesting things in this third book of his trilogy (there's a sequel coming out later this year, but it apparently jumps hundreds of years ahead in time, so I think it's fair to call this a trilogy). Some of the revelations in the third book make sense of earlier events, though they also tremble on the edge of being as silly as midichloridians. We learn a lot more of the underlying rules of the magic universe, and they're kind of intriguingly horrible but also not necessarily all that sensible; I probably would have been better off with \\"that's just how it works, now go use the rules.\\" And the thing I really hated--that the male lead, who was a lover not a fighter until the end of the second book, suddenly became much more powerful than the female lead, something that was emphasized numerous times--moderated by the end, in part because Sanderson kept in mind that her skill and creativity could be more useful than his raw power and in part because he continued to love and trust her and let her take the lead when she thought it was right to do so. Anyway, I see both why some people really enjoy the books and why others are disappointed; I'll read the one I have on tap and then decide whether I'll buy the fourth Mistborn book used.
B004JLYQLA|5.0|Original publication of classic novel that is just as was written anbd first publisher. Many of these old books new publications have been edited in newer publications and are not the exact words as originally written by the author.
0307279189|5.0|THis book reads like a non-stop adventure story. In the middle it slows down some with some of the research & college professors names. In summary I drank the cool aid & bought me some vibrams.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|This is an excellent movie, very original and imaginative. The action and special effects are off the hook it all looks and sounds amazing. This movie is kind of like a comic book and video game mashed together. Some say it was a waste of film that I spoke with but I feel they just expect too much now a-days. Just enjoy what this film is and what it has to offer its a fantastic ride into something different.
0345529057|5.0|After , i wathed the HBO serie game of the throne i decide to buy the set. Definitely better than the serie highly recomended ....
B003YOZNBU|5.0|So many have mentioned how horrible this movie was. Well sir I don't see it! I was expecting the worst but it was never found, I thought this was a great movie it did what it was intended for, it entertained me. I hope WB makes a sequel and signs the cast back in despite what alot of people have said. I would have given this film 4 stars but so many people were negative I made it 5 just to help make up for the other poor reviews.
0545265355|5.0|I didn't buy the boxset, but each separately on kindle. I couldn't put these books down! Read all three in a short period of time, and I actually didn't even realize they were young adult books until I got to the third one. I noticed that the third book had slightly lower ratings than the first two, and I assume it's because it had a little less action. It just took a little longer to get going, and there were longer descriptions and explanations of what the main character was thinking and feeling. Still plently of action though!   I really enjoyed the futuristic setting of these books, I haven't read any similar books in a while. The main character is endearing, intelligent and strong. There are a wide variety of supporting characters, all of which are described so clearly that I easily had a picture in my head of what each was like. All in all just fantastic books!
B0034G4ORC|5.0|If you havent seen this movie yet, why havent ya? Just think Saving Private Ryan and Independance Day juggled together without all the blood and gore. This is a great movie it was done well and thats it.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I have had these classic films on VHS for quite some years now, but really wanted to update to DVD.  In searching for the DVD version's, I came across this beautiful piece of work.  I didn't even know they had come out with 2-disc special editions for the films.  So far, I have only watched the original Batman film with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson and all of the special features.  Really took me back to when this film first came out and what a treat to see how they made the film and everything involved.  I would have normally waited to write a review for this product after watching everything, but I know it is only going to get better.  Of course, my favorites of these films is \\"Batman\\", \\"Batman Returns\\" and \\"Batman Forever\\".  I never really enjoyed \\"Batman & Robin\\", but if you want to complete your collection, I highly recommend this box set.  Or you could always just buy your favorite Batman films separately.  The special features are worth the money and we really ain't talking big money for this box set.  I don't really know what this box set was originally when it first came out, but like I stated earlier, I was under aware they had released it.  If your like Batman, this is the box set for you.
B0051OZ564|1.0|It was stupid and boring to boot. I skipped through huge chunks of it. I did kind of like the ending. Wouldn't watch again and won't recommend.
B004N66XYE|5.0|Brilliant - dazzling clothes, fun plot, strong acting from an impressive cast, great escapism. My only complaint is that it ended too soon: more please!
B00005LE0E|3.0|DVD made in another country and I had to watch it on my computer as it would not play in the DVD player.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is the best book I have ever read yet! It kept me on the edge of my seat with suspense the whole way through. Every time I put the book down, I craved more. I recommend this book!

0345529057|5.0|Great, great, great books.  Definitely read it, even if you've already started watching the HBO series.  The covers are nice and non-hokey, and even though Sean Bean graces the cover of the box, the covers are still standard.
B004KA9MQO|4.0|I loved Jennifer Hudson first cd, so I was expecting this one to be a banger.  It wasn't the JHud I was expecting. Too much pop and dance sounds, that's not really the style i like to hear from her. Overall, its a good cd!
B00005JNS0|3.0|The movie plays absolutely great, however the packaging was from some library. It looked like someone put it through the dishwasher before sending it. But no worries, the DVD player accepts it & so do I.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), an overweight and goodhearted teenager, is able to live her dream and become a regular member of her favorite TV dance program, The Corney Collins Show,which seems to be Baltimore's version of American Bandstand.<br /><br />This lively musical is set in 1962 when segregation was prominent. The issues of prejudice and integration are dealt with in an upbeat manner. See John Travolta transformed into Tracy's plus sized mother. I finished my viewing with a smile on my face and songs in my head, especially \\"You Can't Stop the Beat\\" and \\"Big, Blonde and Beautiful\\" (sang by Queen Latifah).
0307593495|2.0|Whoa! I had recently read three fiercely spirited Swedish novels about the Stupendous Salander and looked forward to Mankell's Wondrous Wallander, whom I had not previously met. Here was a depressingly depressed 60-year-old detective shooting up insulin primarily because he taunts his serious diabetes with acres of alcohol and foodstuffs he should never stuff in his mouth, whines on every page about the debilitation of his old age--cripes, he's five years younger than I, has scary memory lapses and scary sex, another lapse, with an anonymous old bag, pets his dog named for one of my favorite opera singers and consigns the animal to a neighbor for frequent journeys to uncover clues to the ridiculous disappearance of his granddaughter's other grandparents. The clues include a stone, the missing persons' severely handicapped daughter, a pair of shoes placed beside the grandmother (oh, yes, she died along the way), some old photos kept by a fat keeper of old photos who died and left his fat wife to keep the photos which she inexplicably does, and...forget it! Turns out, none of the clues mean squat. The culprit is, somehow, the United States of America (huh?), and socialists are really cool after all.<br /><br />Did I mention the unbearably annoying daughter and her lily livered boyfriend? He should have been named after an opera singer, Melba maybe.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a bad book utterly undeserving of the heaps of praise on this site.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|The official tagline for this film: Welcome to the Bank Robbery Capital of America.<br /><br />Using a strong Boston accent that he first embraced in [[ASIN:0788814664 Good Will Hunting]] (1997), Ben Affleck directed and co-wrote this bank robbery drama that he stars in with Jeremy Renner ([[ASIN:B00275EGWY The Hurt Locker]] - 2009). The FBI agent tracking down the robbers is Jon Hamm ([[ASIN:B000YABIQ6 Mad Men: Season One]]) and female love interests are played by Blake Lively of TV's Gossip Girl and Rebecca Hall. More subplots involve struggles for power, the desire to make a better life, and the importance of family, loyalty and friendship.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|The 2009 film 'The Young Victoria' is a sumptous historical drama/romance starring the enchanting Emily Blunt in the role of Victoria. Emily plays the part brilliantly; high-spirited yet in control, strong willed yet subtly displaying moments of fraility and quiet desperation. Another excellent performance is provided by the immensely talented Paul Bettany in the role of victoria's chief advisor Lord Melbourne. His sharp tongue and clever wit are suited perfectly for the royal court and all the associated politicat machanations associated with affairs of the heirarchy.<br /><br />Aside from the above mentioned performances I will admit that the storyline moves along a little slowly and for those in the audience who are more attracted to action driven rather than dialogue driven films you may want to pass on this one. I would probably be safe in saying that this one is primarily geared towards those viewers who enjoy historical/period films about European royalty.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|Ambitious 28-year-old producer Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) takes the helm of a failing morning show. To revitalize the show, she snares legendary newsman Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) to partner Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton). Hilarity ensues. The banter between Ford and Keaton is spot on.  Becky learns that there's life outside of work, childhood heroes may disappoint, old dreams may no longer fit, and there may be a guy for her after all.
1558908358|5.0|The 1982 Disney movie 'Tron' is a film that was so far ahead of its time that we're only now some thirty years later (give or take a year) able to finally get some degree of perspective on what it's storyline was alluding to. The computerized world we live in today was in many ways forshadowed in this \\"children's\\" film and one can only look back and wonder how in the world they ever knew what may lie ahead in the years to come.<br /><br />Personally the aspects of 'Tron' that I find the most fascinating are the religious/spiritual implications of creating a digital world. The identification of humans, or more specially \\"users\\" as divine, God-like beings, \\"user, oh my user\\", added a wonderful and complex subtext to the storyline that on can examine ad-infinitium. Coupling such suggestive, spiritual inuendos into a largely futuristic, technically oriented film was a bold and brillian move.<br /><br />I think the biggest problem with the film is that it has somehow been programed into the mind of the community-at-large that this is a children's feature. The end result being that those who could really understand it aren't seeing it and the children who are being sat in front of the television to see it don't really understand what's going on. I think that's finally changing.
B002ZG981E|2.0|This futuristic thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio operates on the premise that your mind can be hijacked while you are sleeping and your thoughts can be both stolen or changed by dream invasion. This film earned almost $300 million at the box office to prove how worthy it is, but the film falls flat for me. Although the special effects are dramatic (and Oscar worthy), the plot is confusing and character development is ignored.
B001TODCII|4.0|The '08 cinematic release 'Taken' is an exciting, action packed (though somewhat implausble) rescue / revenge film that doesn't let up from beginning to end. Liam Neeson (one of my favorite actors) is sensational as /Bryan Mills, an ex-spy who singlehandedly undertakes a perilous rescue mission to save his estanged daughter who has been kidnapped by a ring of slave traders. He is relentless, fierce, methodical and cold blooded as he dishes out the same level of pain and punishment practiced by those he pursues.<br /><br />'Taken' is not a film I would suggest for an evening of family entertainment, but if you have a group of guys together who want to see fists flying this is the one.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I've never seen the original Star Trek series. You don't have to know anything about Star Trek to enjoy this film; I'm proof of that.<br /><br />Occurring in an alternate reality to avoid continuity issues with the original series, Star Trek follows a young James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) as they learn to coexist to battle the evil Nero (Eric Bana). The film exhibits smart dialogue, witty humor, engaging friendships, and explosive special effects.<br /><br />If you want to escape for a couple hours, I recommend discovering the new generation of Star Trek - and then you'll be ready when the sequel comes out in 2012!
B004APVI1G|5.0|This was my first 3D movie that I actually purchased, the decision to buy this movie was made after extensive research. I wanted a movie that delivered great 3D special effects and on that had a good story line. I have to admit that when this movie premiered on theaters I was the first to criticize the movie without even seeing it first. But when I purchased my 3D TV I found myself searching through a somewhat limited amount of movies to choose from. All that said, this movie is amazing, a complete treat to your eyes, not only 3D wise but just special effects. The movie is very well made with a solid storyline, not the best storyline, but at least solid, I am sure one that most children will enjoy. the characters are very easy to fall in love with and care for.     This is definitely a movie to at the very least rent to experience. It's my believe that since with have such a limited selection of 3D tittles, all movies out there worth watching for the right price. Since this is a full movie it tends to be more expensive than documentaries (not always true), but at this given point the movie is well worth the $30 I paid for it.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|When retired CIA agents become the target of assassination attempts, they fight back.

Together they must elude top level assassins and discover who's trying to kill them and why.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed seeing a different side of Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman.

0307454541|4.0|After finishing the book, I loved it.  I just finished The Girl Who Played With Fire and I'm not sure how I am going to find the patience to wait until morning to get the final book from the library.  The only reason why I am not giving the book 5 stars is because the first few chapters were a drag to get through.  Especially the in-depth talk about the finance world, which I have no interest in.  As a mom, I don't have much time to sit down and read so I listened to the audiobook while getting stuff done around the house.  If I had been reading the book I might have lost interest during the first 1/4 of the book.  It was definitely worth it to get through!  I can't wait for the third book...and the new hollywood version of the movie (12.21.11)...I hope they don't screw it up!
B002BZOVLG|5.0|The traditional stage types can now stop compaining, they have a opera that may suit their tastes. No more whinging about modern productions, which pushes them out of their comfort zone. I like both types of staging myself. This opera has 18th Century costumes and decor,along with the authentic instrument, Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.  Naturally, this event takes place at Glyndebourne opera house, founded I believe by the Christies.The wife sang opera, Mozart was  her favourite. The singers Miah Persson,Fiordilgi. Dorabella, Anke Vondung. Don Alfonso, Nicolas Rivenq, and the rest of the cast sing extremely well.Beautiful opera. Certainly, should be in your collection. But if you wish to see something completely different, I recommend, the New Valencia opera's, Les Troyens.The opera will put hairs on your chest.
0385732554|5.0|This is a classic. It's hard to find good science fiction in juvenile fiction. The perfectly ordered world is not all that it seems. Jonas is tested with the knowledge gained as the Giver. He will learn of another kind of world - one with war, pain, love, color, etc. As a result, his relationships with his family and friends are altered. This is a terrific book club selection or class read as it invites discussion. What would our world be like without color or emotion? Could a world be ruled by order? The Giver is best suited to a little older, sophisticated reader - an advanced 10-year old up through adult.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Please disregard all of the bitter reviews about this book. The tough life that Katniss lived through is clearly shown , in the inner thoughts and emotions that are given in detail within the book. The in depth description  of what Katniss has lost and gained you can definitely see what makes her strong and weak at the same time.     ***********************SPOILER ALERTS*********************!!!          Yes there is a death that is heartbreaking which is why I took away a star from my rating. Eventhough 20yrs have passed at the end Katniss is still weary of the world, but you can tell she is learning to relax and see good in the world and the people within it. I know if I had lost my father in an expolision, seen countless number of loves killed violently, and had to fight to the death to survive not once but twice! It would probably take me a really long time to be comfortable living in the world too. The Panem that Katniss grew up in is filled with some of the most selfish and cruel government figures it makes our current politicians look like saints. I don't know how this last final book could ever be made into a PG 13 movie...
0767802470|1.0|I purchased this movie for my husband.  He was so disappointed in the quality of the film, he could only watch it for 15 minutes.  Needless to say it was not a good choice.
076532413X|5.0|A much different take on the story, with different settings and characters, than that of the inspired TV show. Nonetheless the book was a good read. I wish they hadn't canceled the show!
0525423273|5.0|I put off reading this book because I thought it would be a superficial chick-lit read. I guess I judged that the cover was so happy/bubbly looking that there wouldn't be a lot of substance to the book. I decided to check my preconceived notions at the door and read this one, though, because I'd read so many glowing  recommendations that I just had to try it. I am very glad that I decided to give this book a try even though it is different from what I typically like to read. It was a wonderful break from my speculative and gritty contemporary kick that I've been on!    This is definitely a read that would qualify as chick-lit, but this book is more than just a pretty (or cute) cover with bubblegum ideas. It walks through the breathless, romantic, falling in love part of life that we all, well, LOVE. If you're a teen or fell in love when you were a teen (aka, almost everyone), you will find a lot to identify with in this story. As Anna begins to have feelings for Etienne, she has to wrestle with herself and her motivations. She wants their relationship to be right - whether as friends or as something more.    Etienne St. Clair is definitely a swoon-worthy guy. Even though his story could be extremely angsty (and there's certainly nothing wrong with that), the darker parts of his past are treated in a way that draws him closer to Anna while still not making this at all heavy. There are so many scenes with him that brought back that dip-in-my-stomach excitement sense of anticipation.    This just delighted me from start to finish, keeping my attention riveted on Anna and Etienne and how their relationship progressed.
B003UESJHO|1.0|The acting was fine and I know that in real life that people are prone to profanity but it isn't needed to get the point of the movie across.  It diminishes the quality and, in this case, there is so much of it that the storyline becomes unimportant.  If you tire of movies with an over-indulgence of profanity then this one isn't for you.  This is a 'NO BUY' movie for us and I'm happy that we only rented it.  It's a strike against Mark Wahlberg.
030746363X|4.0|I am not in a habit of reviewing or recommending books, certainly not \\"diets books.\\"  I have absolutely no connection with or loyalty to the author.  But I purchased this book sight unseen in early May 2011 and I followed the recommended eating plan very closely.  I have now lost 25 pounds in seven weeks, going from 225 pounds to 200 pounds without any \\"workouts\\" (other than three moderate yoga sessions per week).  Eggs and protein shake in the morning (along with a coffee).  Chef salad with vinegrette for lunch.  Protein (alternating fish, beef, pork, rotisserie chicken) with side of vegetables at night.  Sugar free cup of jello for dessert.  Handful of almonds  or pistachios during the day from time to time for a snack.  One \\"binge day\\" a week.  That is it.  Very simple.  No hunger.  No snacking.  You will also be amazed at how much less you spend at the grocery store.  I would think that this diet works for some, and not others, and it seems to me that the negative reviews are from people who already are in pretty good shape and who exercise and workout regularly.  I think this plan works best for people, like me, whose metabolic rates are low and who need to get it kickstarted (which this diet does through the use of some supplements, all which can be found at GNC and which do not have to be purchased from or through the author -- which I would have been very wary about doing).  The one thing this book really opened my eyes up to is that exercise is NOT the way to lose weight despite all the drama and theatrics on shows like \\"Biggest Loser\\" -- for example, the author simply points out the fact that it would take over 12 hours of hard walking on a treadmill to burn off a single meal of pasta alfredo from the Olive Garden.  Exercise, without a change in diet, will NEVER be able to keep up with weight gain for most people.  So, the change has to come through diet, not with the goal of reducing caloric intake (which causes hunger pains and bingeing and ultimately, failure), but rather from transferring those calories from starches and processed sugars (which trigger insulin response and fat production) to proteins (which do not).  It really is quite easy, as long as you don't mind eating a lot of eggs and egg whites and you can give up diet drinks and beer (and can drink red wine).  The only logistical difficulty is in finding good alternatives for lunches at work (given that bread / sandwiches are a big no no).  It really is amazing to me how quickly the human body can snap back into shape in only 6-7 weeks after months / years of mistreatment, and how the body will shed the fat on its own if you just let it (and don't drown it with sugar and carbs).  My plan is to lose another 5 to 10 pounds (which I should achieve after 12 weeks) and then wean myself back to a more normal diet (re-incorporating things like some fruit, oatmeal, wheat bread, yogurt, etc.).  This book has truly given me a new perspective on food / weight management and I highly recommend it to someone who needs to lose 20-30 pounds and then keep it off.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />The original version of \\"Clash of the Titans\\" was an infinitely entertaining - and still fondly remembered - piece of early `80s kitsch comprised of one part corn to two parts cheese.  It was further distinguished by having a number of acting legends of both stage and screen (i.e., Lawrence Olivier, Maggie Smith) slumming their way through the project - and obviously having the time of their professional lives doing so.<br /><br />The 2010 version, directed by Louis Leterrier, trades in star power and campiness for improved special effects and a more straightforward action-movie approach to the material (though Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes do appear as Zeus and Hades, respectively).<br /><br />Sam Worthington stars as Persius, the demi-god son of Zeus, who leads the humans in a war against the gods, whom he blames for the deaths of his adoptive parents and little sister.  Persius also must face-down and defeat the mighty Kracken, a terrifying, indestructible beast that serves as the gods' ultimate weapon against the people.<br /><br />It's all very Saturday-matinee juvenilia in spirit and tone, but the pacing is swift, the special effects impressive, and the various and sundry monsters and creatures sufficiently imaginative and larger-than-life to make us suspend our disbelief, if only for the duration.<br /><br />Good fun.
B0057XSCJG|5.0|I loved this movie.  Aside from some minor language and the gun shot scene, appropriate for all ages. I don't need to give you a synopsis of the film, but as far as my review goes, it is a cautionary tale that tells you not to take your vanity for granted.  Embrace your own style and don't discourage others from theirs.  And although \\"Beastly\\" is written as a love story, one can derive questions from it to ask themselves.  What would you do if you walked by Kyle on the street?  What would you do if he said hello?      Rent it, watch it, love it.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Okay, I'll admit it...I'm old.  When I was a teenager, the raciest YA books I knew of were those written by Judy Blume.  I read \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" of course (all my friends did) but that was an adult book.  So when I read \\"Mockingjay\\", a book my 12-year-old daughter finished a few months ago, my jaw dropped.  Sexual slavery?  Incest?  Torture, bloody assassination, and the murder of innocents?  I guess this is the brave new world of fiction for kids.<br /><br />So what makes this series worth reading?  I believe it's the honesty.  Although the story line of the books deals with the glamorization of violence, Collins depicts these brutal acts for what they are: ugly, detestable, and heart-rending.  She doesn't sugar-coat them.  In 'Mockingjay' especially, this author shoves her readers' noses deep into a dystopian society that idolizes cruelty instead of working to get rid of it.<br /><br />There are obvious parallels in our culture to the fictional hunger games in the stories.  Reality shows like \\"Real Housewives\\" (which I am guilty of watching) or even \\"Survivor\\" (again, a show I watch) tend to glamourize or make fun of mental instability and conflict rather than regard them as tragedies.  I'm not one to lump our culture together and call it all bad, but I do think we need to be careful of what we believe.  Reality TV is a far cry from real life.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' \\"Hunger Games\\" series is the \\"1984\\" of a new generation.

078689136X|5.0|Actually, \\"Heat\\" is Nikki Heat, a New York City Police Department detective, and she isn't naked.  Also, Richard Castle is a fictitious author.  This novel and its predecessor, Heat Wave, are the creations of ABC Studios and are based on that network's hugely successful show, Castle.  Like the character, Castle, in the show, Jameson Rook is a journalist who \\"rides along\\" with Detective Heat, taking notes for his books.  Of course, he helps solve her cases.  In Naked Heat, they solve the murder of a gossip columnist who had cultivated a slew of enemies.  These books are fun to read!
0156027321|3.0|(Spoilers.)<br /><br />I first read this book when it was originally published. After reading it again recently, I remembered liking it a lot more back then than I did this time around--perhaps because my critical thinking skills have improved since then.<br /><br />The book has three sections:<br /><br />1) It sets the premise in two ways simultaneously: a) very detailed descriptions of zoo animals and their ability to adapt to situations and humans and b) introductions to several religions and one boy's love for them all. Suffice it to say, there's a lot of foreshadowing all throughout this section. This part takes some persistence to get through because it can be really dry; fortunately, there are some compelling parts thrown in.<br /><br />2) Pi's experiences on the boat with the animals, survival, adaptation, suffering--basically what you'd expect to read in a book about survival at sea. It all ties back to what we learned in the first section about animals and their adabtability.<br /><br />3) His rescue and interrogation about what happened to the Tsimtsum and everyone else aboard it. There is also significant focus on the truth of his story regarding the animals and a curious retelling of the story involving no animals at all.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very simple story that is somehow made into 400 pages. :) Even during the dry parts in the beginning, I kept reading and never had a desire to stop. I wanted to know what happened and Pi is a likable character. But, there were several things that didn't sit right with me:<br /><br />- Disproving one's own theories.<br /><br />Martel states a less-than-positive view of agnostics, in that they are \\"on the fence\\" and why would you not just pick one side or the other? However, irony is introduced when Pi is unable to pick a religion he likes best, so he follows three of them. So... indecision about whether or not a higher power exists is disgraceful, but following several religions because you can't decide between them is to be lauded?<br /><br />- Unexplained chapters from the future.<br /><br />I did not understand the chapters that were in italics, which were apparently someone visiting Pi's home in the future and writing his story down (thus supposedly creating the book we're reading now). These chapters never seemed to lead anywhere for me, they mysteriously stop in the middle of the book, and they added no value. They only served as a confusing spoiler to show that Pi survived his ordeal. They felt thrown in and hurt the continuity, like the book had to be 100 chapters exactly and so fluff was needed.<br /><br />- Rambling on and on and on...<br /><br />I skipped a lot of large sections that were paragraph upon paragraph of foods he wanted to eat, descriptions of the surroundings, and other topics. I get it already! Sheesh.<br /><br />- What was the point?<br /><br />I have no idea what Martel meant with the ending of the book. I felt like so much was set up with the relationship between the first and second parts of the book, but then it all was forgotten in the third section where things should have been tied neatly together, like Martel was as lost in his own book as Pi was at sea. Is the point that we all want to believe in something fantastical, no matter how improbable, because that's better than being faithless, so this book is meant to be a metaphor for why people turn to religion?<br /><br />Wouldn't this negate the purpose of the book entirely because, rather than demonstrating the importance of constant, fervent faith, it would be like comparing religion to escapism and fantasy, showing it to be a coping mechanism people use because they can't handle life as it is and they don't want to take responsiblity for their own fate? (Which is basically how atheists feel...) Or maybe that IS the point and Martel is actually disproving of religion when all along I thought he was advocating it? I don't know!<br /><br />- I cannot reconcile Pi as the tiger.<br /><br />-- Does that mean that the tiger showed how Pi was at odds with himself at times?<br />-- It is supposed to represent Pi's inner strength?<br />-- Does it mean Pi developed a dual-personality to cope with the situation?<br />-- Does this \\"prove\\" that, in fact, there were no animals aboard at all and Pi made them all up as a form of escapism instead of choosing to believe the truth of what was happening to him (which, as I stated previously, would negate the point of the whole book)?<br />-- Maybe Pi was just insane?<br />-- Maybe it doesn't matter if the animals existed or what version is true because in the end Pi was neither helped or hindered by religion and all that mattered was that he survived, not how he coped? (Which, again, wouldn't seem to serve the purpose of the book.)<br /><br />All that said, this book is at least worth reading, if nothing else to form your own opinion on it and find your own meaning in it. Maybe you will be less confused than I was. :) Plus, I actually found the version with the people more compelling than the version with the animals, so that alone was worth the read.-- Does it mean Pi developed a dual-personality to cope with the situation?  -- Does this \\"prove\\" that, in fact, there were no animals aboard at all and Pi made them all up as a form of escapism instead of choosing to believe the truth of what was happening to him (which, as I stated previously, would negate the point of the whole book)?  -- Maybe Pi was just insane?  -- Maybe it doesn't matter if the animals existed or what version is true because in the end Pi was neither helped or hindered by religion and all that mattered was that he survived, not how he coped?

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I bought these for my son.  He isn't terribly abusive of products he owns.  These broke after two weeks.  They seem to be weak around the area where they swivel.  It is all made of plastic about the size and diameter of a straw.  We got them replaced by Turtle Beach.  They were nice about it.  The new ones lasted a month before they broke.  We just taped them together and a month later the other side broke.  We are looking for something with metal and replaceable parts.  I really don't recommend these.

Well, I instantly fell in love with the first two tracks of the album aftering hearing them for the first time ever. I then listened to the whole album sometime later during a outside jog one evening. I can say I like about every track on the album.<br /><br />Of course, it is already recognized that Arcade Fire's music is experimental and different genres can be heard in their music. Of course you hear music influences in this album(e.g. Bruce Springsteen). What modern music bands of today are NOT influenced by past musicians/artists?<br />I will admit that I never bought or even listened to this band's previous album since buying their album \\"Funeral\\" 5 years ago. I've always been aware of the album \\"Neon Bible\\" existed but I've never listened to it. I did buy and listen to \\"Funeral\\" plenty of times over the past 5 years.<br /><br />Arcade Fire is one of those low-key \\"needle in the haystack\\" bands....well, at least in the city where *I* live. Anyway, this is music that is not thrown in anyone's face and like most indie music, this is music you have to search for and approach all on your own without anyone else's opinion or influence. This is certainly not music for the masses and NOT the music that everyone and their mother listens to... and I like it that way. :)
B0012OGCO6|1.0|The story is set in purgatory where the seven archangels battle seven fallen \\"Dark angels\\" for the souls sent there.  Currently power has shifted to the evil side and the last hope for the good, Gabriel is sent down.  The beginning tells us only one can be sent down every \\"cycle\\" whatever a cycle is they don't tell us but it doesn't matter because they are all down there now (it made it seem like there was only one at a time).  Inexplicably, they have to take \\"human\\" form?  What?  I thought they were just souls there?  No, in this world there is a apparently a second chance of life with real physical forms/bodies in purgatory who bleed, eat, drink, party etc.  (already weak story line).  Purgatory looks suspiciously like NYC except it is raining all the time.  So yep, purgatory has electricity, crime, bugs, cars etc.  Just as an aside, you never see any wings so despite the main picture on the cover, there are no real angel battles, just gangster style shootings and poor fight scenes.  The archangels have blue eyes and the fallen angels have orangish red eyes-to make it easy to distinguish.  Spoiler alerts here on out:  So when Gabriel gets there he finds all the other archangels except Michael?  Hmm, wonder where he is . . . uh oh, there is that strange looking guy with white eyes who never gets names and says he used to follow the ways of God but now bosses the fallen angels around. . . do you think?  Yes!  Wow that was a tough to figure out . . . not.  So the entire story is Gabriel killing fallen angels (not exciting action-one fight even has the figures fight in a weird light that changes them to look like yellow cartoons figures).  The other activity is finding the other archangels, well they decided it was too tough and unfair to be sent down there to help out in purgatory so they just gave up and became whores, drunks, homeless, soup kitchen operators etc.  Of course, this is totally reasonable for the archangels . .. not!  The weak story comes down to a final battle with Michael who waits to the end to fight Gabriel just to allow the slow and weak plot to unfold.  The battle at the end is totally useless and if anyone hasn't figured out that guy is Michael they must have been living in a cave or under 7 years old, as it is obvious in this slow and poorly done movie.  I love cult classics, like Highlander that other reviewers mentioned but I hated this.  Andy Whitfield was actually OK as Gabriel but had nothing to work with.  Samantha Noble as Jade was ridiculous, she needs to close her mouth.  It hangs open the entire film and makes her look mentally slow (although she could just be bored with the movie!).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read!  Loved the trilogy!  Definitely recommend, but be prepared to not want to put it down until the last line of the third book!
0817439390|5.0|I FINALLY understand exposure!!  I have been taking pictures for more than 20 years with a point-and-shoot and didn't put much thought into exposure really...I just framed what I wanted and snapped away.  About a year ago, I graduated to a digital SLR and still feel that I am an amateur photographer.  I felt it was time to learn about all the manual modes because otherwise I wasn't using my SLR to it's fullest capability.  The manual that came with the camera didn't really help me to understand how to use all the options, so I bought more books...I was still confused about exposure until I read THIS book.  Bryan Peterson breaks it down in a way that I was able to read the book WHILE using my camera for different \\"assignments\\" and the light bulb went off...I truly had an \\"a-ha\\" moment...mainly the realization that there is a big difference between \\"correct\\" exposure and \\"creative\\" exposure.  I cannot wait to see the improvement in my photos, as I experiment with what I have learned.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Funny film from becoming to end.  Especially love the sign at the Bank of  Evil (formerly Lehman brothers).  That was a great (and probably very un-PC)  gag, especially after the Wall Street looting this country went through.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|Marines who kick arse, but don't take names (presumably because they don't speak squid alien), is what this movie is.  Not the greatest or most creative plot in the world (alien invasion, how novel).  The acting and action is fairly good.  Action packed and filled with arse kicking.  Definitely a renter!
B0045HCJIA|5.0|Enjoyable movie.  I haven't seen it in a long time.  Love the theme. If the main character was pissed off at the world situation then, he'd really be beside himself in today's upside, PC B.S. scociety.

0062060554|2.0|An over long, over priced, entirely predictable book. This is the classic case of a publisher promoting a poorly written book around an intriguing idea. I was so annoyed I had bought it, that I forced myself to finish it, though in truth I sped read from Chapter three on.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|This Blu-Ray extended edition really is the only one you should see given the added material. The addition of darker elements of the film helps fill in some holes left by the somewhat jerky and incomplete story. I don't much care for films that rely on fantasy and happenstance to \\"explain\\" much of the glitches in the writing. Nevertheless, this is nice eye-candy on Blu-Ray and the story is better told in this longer format. If you hated it in the theater, you'll hate it here. But if you sort of liked it or really liked it, this version is going to be a home-run for you.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|When I orginally watched the movie I thought it was OK. The movie seemed a bit choppy, like it was put together haphazardly. So I preferred the original Batman with Jack Nicholson as The Joker. I was watching a review of this and someone said to watch the acting of Heath Ledger. So I put aside my feelings for the movie and watched it again. Wow! When you watch the movie you see an actor acting the Two Face. When you see Heath Ledger, you see The Joker, not an actor. When you watch it, you get the sense that The Joker is a psychopath, you don't see Heath Ledger acting. Over all I would probably buy it again.
0553386794|3.0|I'm not exactly sure what I'm feeling right now. I'm not really angry...I'm definitely not happy...perhaps I'm just disappointed. The fact that he writes well is a plus. The fact that he makes it easy for you to visualize his world, his characters, and everything else is great.<br /><br />But come on! The story was just dragging on, and on, and on. And it was usually a lot of pointless stuff, such as over explaining things, or over describing things, or uselessly drawn out scenes. I wanted so bad to finish this book (audio version), however, I was just getting bored. It's probably my fault, because I was expecting a lot more action. Maybe watching the HBO show will be better.
0679720200|5.0|Meursault, Camus' protagonist in 'The Stranger', is an alienated, anonymous man of no apparent consequence who feels part of nothing, believes in nothing, and stands for nothing.  At the start of the 'The Stanger', Meursault's alienation makes him appear cold, unsympathetic but largely benign, however as the plot develops it becomes apparent that his only conviction - that nothing matters - incrementally affects others with ultimately tragic consequences.  Although Camus leaves the inner thoughts of his other characters unsaid, presumably the girlfriend of Meursault's petty criminal friend does not wish to be beaten by Raymond and then see him protected by Meursault's false testimony, just as being shot dead on a beach is of some consequence to Meursault's Arab victim.<br /><br />A lesser writer would have made this a simple tale about the perils of alienation in modern society, or railed against the apparent injustice of Meursault being sentenced to death not so much for killing a man as for his apparent lack of contrition.  Camus' sparse, direct and deceptively simple writing manages to pose more subtle and penetrating questions through opening doors, even though the reader isn't led through them by the hand.  Is the casual yet ultimately cruel indifference of a Meursault the inevitable result if a society tears down traditional (if admittedly imperfect) values and conventions and fails to replace them with anything better?  How do we reconcile the right of individuals to see the world and act as they see fit (even if they consider nothing of value) with the right of others - who may consider things important - to be protected from the results of indifference?<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0307716511|3.0|Rosamund Lupton's \\"Sister\\" is the story of British sisters Beatrice and Tess.  Beatrice lives in New York and receives word that Tess, her younger sister, has died in London.  This phone call sets Beatrice on a quest to find out how and why her sister died.  Although she is told Tess committed suicide, Beatrice is unconvinced and goes on a quest to find out what really happened.<br /><br />I didn't like this book as much as I thought I would based on some reviews I read before I got it.  I had read something about it in a magazine and put it on my Amazon wish list, and then it turned up on Vine so I ended up getting it that way.  For Vine books I normally don't look at other reviews, so I can go to it without any preconceived ideas, but since I didn't know it would be available I'd already checked it out a bit when I received it from Vine.  The mixed reviews I read may have influenced me.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the writing was quality, and the plot is interesting; it's the execution that bothered me.  It was, for me, an uneasy mix of crime procedural/re-creation and over-the-top, almost hysterical emotion that made me uncomfortable.  There's a line that is sometimes crossed with expressing emotion in a book or film that makes the reader or viewer want to shy away rather than get caught up in it, and this book's overwrought feelings didn't make me feel sympathy; I just wanted to put the book down and walk away.  I sometimes rolled my eyes at the things that Beatrice was saying, and found her irritating even though in her position I might do the same thing.  Her frequent protestations that she isn't crazy, and that someone was psychologically torturing her sister prompted my reference to \\"Gaslight\\", which is also over-the-top emotionally.<br /><br />It reminded me a little of the recent AMC television show \\"The Killing\\" in which a police procedural is punctuated by overdone emotional wallowing.  It doesn't work for me.  I think this book would have been improved by toning down the emotional stuff.  I liked the parts where Beatrice looks into various aspects of Tess' life.  I could have done with more of that and less of Beatrice's navel-gazing platitudes about her own problems.<br /><br />I felt the ending came a little too suddenly, as if the author realized she needed to bring it to a quick close, and didn't quite work.<br /><br />I'd recommend this with the caveat that some readers may have the same reaction as I did to the overdone emotions.  It's not a bad book and I think the author has promise (it's her first novel).d by toning down the emotional stuff.  I liked the parts where Beatrice looks into various aspects of Tess' life.

B004XE0P5E|4.0|Loved the CD from the moment I put it on.  However, the last song just broke my heart; it opens up sounding like a Peter Cetera-era Chicago ballad from the 80's, then breaks into some Kanye vocoder crap, and to round it out, takes a turn to country twang guitar.  Other than that, the 10 songs clock in at just under 40 minutes.  Stick with your original ideas, boys....
0061784788|5.0|I anxiously awaited the release of The Devil Colony, the latest in James Rollins' Sigma Force series. When I opened the book and read the first page, I settled in and didn't stop reading until I turned the last page on the book. The Devil Colony is the best book, bar none, that James Rollins has written, and believe me when I say, that's saying something. The action is fast-paced, tense, and all too-realistic in the dangers evolving in the book. Toss in ancient artifacts, ancient technologies and an end-of-world scenario...shoot! It's just too good to put down!<br /><br />This book is what I term a \\"must buy\\" and a fabulous addition to any home or public library. And if you're buying this one, you might as well buy the rest of the Sigma Force books too, beginning with[[ASIN:0062017853 Map of Bones (Sigma Force)]]!

It has a great deal of information in it that made me think.  I had never even heard of Hela cells prior to reading this book.  This book is more than technical information.  It gave the people involved a name and a face.  Thank you Rebecca Skloot
B004V6MWFU|3.0|I'm a big EV fan (therefore can't give it less than 3 stars) and love pretty much all his work along with the occasional ukulele song on previous albums... But this one for me doesn't quite do it. It's just too monotone and absolutely can't be listened twice in a row. It does work fine as a curiosity in an opus of a great singer... And surely you can imagine some random guy come to a record company with these same recordings and get laughed out the door.

0756405890|5.0|It has certainly been an interesting time for fantasy readers.  We have seen our genre torn to shreds over the silliness that Harry Potter and the multiple spin-offs have provided.  Patrick Rothfuss has made a concerted effort, whether conscious or not, to restore the faith in the genre to those who cherish the works of Herbert, Martin, Lloyd, Anderson, and Tolkien (to name a few).  This book features everything that a good book in this genre is required to have (or should be required, that is). Sympathetic magic, a complex series of languages that is clear and consistent, love, hate, pain, and happiness.  This work captivated my imagination, a feat not easily accomplished.

B0057AOOZ0|5.0|Wow, I really love Beyonce.  I was skeptical at first listening to her song Run The World, but of course, listening to it over and over again on Sirius and local radio station I slowly became a fan.  First, I am not just an R&B type of chic,but love pop,classic,rock,reggae,and islander music as well. This album is a great album and happy to have her back on the radio.  I will not list my favorites songs on the album because my love for each one is the same.  Reading the credits and notice The Dream produced and co wrote like 10 of the songs.  I am think he did an awesome job..

Well I did not care about anyone in the book, and was thankful that the book was short.

B004A8ZX2S|5.0|>(there are some spoilers in my review)<    We humans are very sensitive even if our lives are suffused with far too much data, noise and stuff. Sometimes we just yearn towards environments within reach that restore our sense of inner calm, even if we know it will only be a brief respite.  In that space we create for ourselves, many times we find ourselves taking stock.  One of the themes in this film are the moments when we reflect and try to bring order and sense to the fragmented histories that we live through.  Terrance Malick is by nature a contemplative man who has looked down into the philosophical well.  He uses movies as his canvas much as other artists like Beethoven or Michelangelo use their mediums to express their ideas, feelings and testaments.  Malick has completed so few films that to examine the amount of words that each one generates it all adds up to a disproportionate amount of discharge.  He makes big films that expand the mind, stretch the senses and challenge our preconceptions.      \\"The Tree of Life\\" could be seen as a 3'rd instalment of a triptych or perhaps the last instalment in a trilogy that began several years ago with the richly rewarded \\"The Thin Line\\" followed closely by the very moving \\"The New World\\".  There are so many connective themes appearing in the three films that one can draw the conclusion that these are more than mere Malickisms and that they are more than just hallmarks of his stylistic prowess.  A composer uses the same notes just like a painter uses the same colors; what is unique is the novel arrangements of those notes and colors, shaped into fresh ideas each time.  The scenes of swaying tall grasses, camera shots pointed straight up into stands of very tall trees, hands touching blades of grass, the sounds of crickets, running, rushing or blasting water all permeate these films.  The sounds and images of young children, symbolizing life at the outset, not yet sullied and tarnished are all here.  The lack of dialogue, long a Malick standard that thumbs its nose at overly wordy mainstream films is used in all three films to great theatrical effect.  I have always maintained that the most powerful moments in cinematic history are those emoted by the eyes and mouth of an actor and not by the actual dialogue which is more often than not just pompous self conscious signs pointing to meaning.  Humans long ago learned to read faces before language evolved and it remains our most primal means of communication.  Why, therefore, Malick receives so much criticism for how little is spoken in his films says much more about how unaccommodating and impatient we are with non-formulaic motion pictures; it says a lot about how we have forgotten that in silence so much can be said.  I enjoy being reminded of this by his art and ethos.  It continues to amaze me that recent commentary about this film includes such accusations as \\"pretentious\\", \\"ponderous\\", \\"boring\\", etc.  This is such a reflection of the madness of our times where everything is expected to be formula driven, patterned on many generations of people who grew up watching sit-coms and dramas on television, with their shallow and empty `entertainment' completely fabricated in the mould of screen time versus advertisement time.  Critics simply don't know how to look, see, hear and drink in images without recourse to the expected, the special effects, and the gratuitous use of nudity or sexual innuendo, satisfying needs for titillation.  These same people would walk into an art gallery and sneer, \\"what a waste of time this is\\" and \\"what the hell is that supposed to mean?\\"  Ok, enough lamenting.    The film is a bit too long but this is just my first impression.  Like his earlier films in the apparent trilogy we hear hushed, whispered and softly spoken dialogue that is a palpable layer on top of the visual images, often sounding like prayers.  This is a Malick touch and few directors use this mannerism as well or as often.  Unlike the sound editing of the voice-overs in \\"The New World\\", which suffered from too quiet levels, the voice-overs here are clearly audible.  The film has five editors, which is amazing enough but perhaps as in his other films, there was so much film shot that had to be cut and put together.  Once again his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki is the star of the show.  There are some shots that are so awesome that one wonders if they are all natural versus CGI compositions. They hint at mystery, point at the infinite within the contours of finite spaces.  Malick has directed Lubezki to shoot many scenes where there is constant motion, strongly suggestive of agitation.  And always the rush of water, the sweep of wind through grass and trees, the sounds of animals and crickets, the softening colors of sunsets, the shock of sudden noises.    The central powerhouse that generates the endless tension that coils and winds up all the action radiates from the character played with great skill by Brad Pitt.  His character is driven, disappointed by how his desires always eluded him, a tough ex-Navy man who is going to show his sons how to be a man, even if it means that he sometimes acts callow, heartless and insensitive to his family.  It matters little really that the time period of the drama takes place in the late 50's or that it is a middle class family in Texas, because the same family dynamics could take place now, even though our modern big city landscapes are imbued with different languages, cultures and values.    One of the big ideas that Malick presents is the notion that life gives you two choices for the way you live: that of nature or of grace.  Nature implies the impersonal and often brute way that animals act, more often than not the survival mode drawing power from deep survival roots, hardwired into the reptilian part of our brains.  The implication of grace is the softening values inherent in most mainstream religions.  We are talking about forgiveness, giving love andextending understanding and this is echoed in Christian and Jewish traditions.  Malick is not making a judgement but we feel the presence of the boundary between the two values and there is little we can do but squirm if we are not sure how we stand.      Another theme examines the tensions that simmer between fathers and sons as they both grow older.  The son naturally pushes back at the ever tightening grip of his father as he looks to assert his own will, find his voice and grow in self realization.  All of this is portrayed against a family background of pain and marital conflict.  The eldest son finds himself unconsciously acting out hurtful behaviour towards his own brothers and is shocked by his own acts.   This is then greatly amplified when we discover that one of the brothers dies a mysterious, unnamed death; his reaction to this is to carry a heavy guilty weight which he is unable to shake loose.  In some ways the family dynamics are very typical of many families in almost any era.  However, the film elevates the drama to high levels where we view almost dreamlike states, listening in on inner conversations of the characters.  I am not certain why he wrote the script with so much unresolved angst at the core of the family unit.  I would have to see this again a few more times and try to come up with answers to the questions it raises.    The film goes in and out of time lines that all reference what the tree of life represents.  Of course, the tree of life is first and foremost a Biblical reference to the Garden of Eden, to a state of perfection, innocence and the beginnings of human life.  God gave instructions to his first two humans to notice two trees growing in the garden; the tree of life (allowed) and the tree of knowledge (forbidden and restricted).  In Malick's film the tree of life is the central motif, with strong allusions to evolution of life on the planet. Where is the tree of knowledge then?  In the Bible the eating of the fruit of knowledge is the very act that destroys the pure relationship between humans and their Creator.  Are the characters in this film damaged by knowledge?  One could argue that the death in the family might have been the price they paid for knowledge, perhaps the children's knowledge of how very unhappy their parents marriage was, how unhappy their father was is a type of knowledge that burns and leaves a scar.  It is an obscure theme and I would need to see the film a few more times before I was sure.     Contemplation is front and center in the film.  Malick, as the Creator of the film, adopts the position of the heights, looking back on how it all came to be and looking far into the future, how it will all end.  These swirling images of planets, stars, suns, galaxies enter and exit the film several times, reminding me now of the role that the black metallic slab played in Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\".  Malick poses questions but I am not sure if he also has presented his answers.  If nature is inherently brutal, clumsy, amoral and this is the way that life evolved, where is the room for the state of grace that is offered as a counterbalance to nature's way?  Is grace a man-made way of living, created out of painful reaction against the rawness of nature's way?   The film is littered with several philosophical questions and it does not end with a clear resolution.  Some of the ambiguity is dealt with in an interesting dream sequence, which I suppose you could see as a life after death scenario where we all get to unite with loved ones from a past life. The child that dies we are not told how or why he died and it is only subtly hinted as to which child it was in this dream sequence.  The mother's voice offering up her son to the sky, to God, is strongly reminiscent of the many scenes in \\"The New World\\" where Pocahontas offers her prayers to the spirits with her hands held up and open towards the sky.     In the three films that I refer to, there is a price paid by some major character for seeking and finding grace or for letting it go.  I am not certain that Malick is stating that this is inevitable but it is strongly suggestive.  There is so much going on in this film that I will need a few more viewings to clarify my own thoughts.  It is truly the largest scale film he has ever made. Its overall obscurity and dreamlike state leaves the doors open to so many interpretations and I am not clear that this was intentional.  Deep, provocative, emotionally stirring and challenging, this will not be widely received and appreciated by patrons looking for formulaic and predictable entertainment.  This opus demands multiple viewings and quiet consideration.
B004SIP9Z6|4.0|Casablanca meets Death Wish in a beautiful festival of violence. Bruce Willis was Humphrey Bogart and Clive Owen was Charles Bronson. While Mickey Rourke actually sort of reminds me of King Kong. He's out of control and you know he's got to die but still its a shame. Sin City itself is set in a world where money has bought all power. In other words, it's the Republican vision of the future.

What are they owed in the first place isn't an easy question to answer. But nice, chatty style about a story that really many more people should know.
B003XCVQ3C|3.0|I thought that this product would carry sound and video from the new mac to a receiver then to tv or projector though so far I have been unsuccessful.  It does however carry video very nicely though I had it on battery for a movie and from 100% to 23% in 2 hours of viewing. This is more about the Apple mac though. I would be willing to reconsider if people have both video and Audio working.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|This item was a house gift and it did not work.  I have this sweeper and love it, so very disappointed with this one.
B00009W0U4|4.0|The film is very powerful, the messages through out the film (because it is shown as a backwards sequenced movie) are alot and sometimes very realistic.  The movie gives the audience something to think about as they witness all these difference  many events unfolding .. i would say that the movie is a good movie to maybe watch by yourself if you want something to kind of pick at your mind a little bit.. because all in all, this is a very trippy movie but the trips are very humbling.. so, my review is that i liked it's a good movie..  but very shocking and you won't be able to escape feeling something from watching it.. that's for sure.

B000NTPDSW|1.0|BUYERS BEWARE! Do not purchase from Electronica Direct. They send a foregin version of the blu way that is defintley not the American version advertised on amazon. Hopefully the other sellers are more honest with thier products but I know Electronica Direct doesn't care. I have been buying DVDS/Blu Rays for 10 years (mostly through amazon and others through amazon) and never have I recieved a product that was not 100% authentic. Electronica Direct should be ashamed to call themselves a company. What kind of bussiness surives in this country when they can't even sell American products as promised without using some ripoff/bootleg foregin version of a product. Very disappointed. I have never had bad service like this in a long time. It's sad to think Electronica Direct think people are okay with them just sending false versions of a product out. Do no fall victim to this company. BEWARE Electronica Direct!!!!!!
031261246X|5.0|I wish I had read this book sooner.  As an IT Pro who teaches security it is chilling to think that the events portrayed in Zero Day could happen... but this book drives home how real cyber-terrorism is.      If you want to read a truly horrifying murder mystery, read a novel written by a world leading homocide detective.  Within the field of IT Security there are few names as respected as Mark Russinovich, and his portrayal of the ultimate Distributed Attack drived home how important the most overlooked aspects of computer maintenance really are - from strong security (which Mark reminds us herein can always be defeated) to a well planned and properly implemented (AND TESTED) backup strategy are.    Knowing that companies like some of the ones portrayed in Zero Day rely on my skills - and those of the people that I teach them to - to protect them, I read this book with chills running down my spine.  With that being said, I couldn't put it down!  BUY THIS BOOK!

2070612368|5.0|Naturally, I originally read this book in English and loved it. Having lived in francophone countries for periods in my life, I chose to pick up the french version of this text in order to brush off some of the rustiness in my grammatical command of the French language. This is a PERFECT way to expand your French if you are a beginner (as many of you undoubtedly have memorized pieces of the English text); furthermore, for those already familiar with French yet looking for grammatical review, this is also of use. The translation is perfect, in my eyes, and the names of characters, in particular, have a peculiar resonance in French that is lacking in English. They are more straightforward, to be sure, than J.K.'s latin-based names, yet I found them comfortable, and I thoroughly enjoyed this translation.    A-grade work!
B001U0HBPG|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in a while, I had always wondered how it turned out in the end, if he goes to being a baby or not and my question was answered.  Really great movie, good for a movie night with friends as well.
0143036424|5.0|A terrific book set in Wyoming with winter looming and a wonderful cast of characters. Sheriff Walt Longmire sometimes seems like the long-suffering ring-master of a law-enforcement circus.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I'm always on the lookout for a new author/series when it comes to my favorite genre...paranormal romance.  Working in a bookstore, I pretty much get to see a lot of it.  I love J.R. Ward, Sherrilynn Kenyon, Lora Leigh, Nalini Singh,...I could go on. :)    Ms. Harrison's Dragon Bound is an excellent read.  The world she is building has a variety of characters/species...Dragons, Fae, and other Wyr clans.  The alpha male of the story is facinating and stays true to what he is, and the female is just as I like my heroines...smart, sassy and independent.  The world building the author does keeps your interest, the dialog fits the characters and at times had me cracking up!  The story is not all fluff..there are definately some dramatic scenes...and the romance?  Pretty darn HOT!  :)   I liked the sub-characters and am really looking forward to having their stories told.  Thea Harrison is a new face in paranormal romance, and I think she's here to stay.  Pick up your own copy of Dragon Bound...I'm pretty sure you won't be sorry.
B0057XSCJG|3.0|This movie, Beastly, while containing many scenes that I felt were stiff and a little dull was an okay movie. However, being someone who read and loved the book version which was excellent, I was a little disappointed at how the movie turned out. I feel like it was rushed and didn't capture all the important aspects that were in the book. This movie is only 86 minutes and the book is quite long, so that alone shows that the details were not exact or relevent to accurately portray the entire purpose and lesson of the story. I give it 3 stars for visual aspects, and the few accomplishments it made to stay true to the story.
0553386794|2.0|Mr. Martin is a talented author.  His use of words to create pictures and feelings is adroit and rare.  Unfortunately his talent made me feel nauseated.  I have no need to fill my mind with the images that his words create.  I did not finish his first book and will never read another.  One never knows what disgusting little tidbit waits on the next page.  I for one do not care to find out.  If I want to be sickened by what I read I will pick up the evening newspaper and read about child abuse and murder.  I read for pleasure and Mr. Martin does not know how to write that. This is one reader who will definitely not be coming back for more, it is just not worth it.
B000OYCN98|5.0|Excellent. Black Sabbath meets Neu! at a science fiction/adult film convention being held inside a research station on the moon! After a few bottles of Jolt cola, a Carrie Fisher look-alike sighting and a panel discussion with Marilyn Chambers, the bands decide it's time for rocking. Dancers join the ensemble on a makeshift stage and promptly disrobe, offering themselves as an offering to the great lords of rock.   Or something to that effect... This album is a great overview of Hawkwind's best material. Haven't even gotten around to watching the bonus DVD!
1600108512|5.0|I bought this at Anime Expo 2011, where I met Peter S. Beagle, the author. He signed the book for me and I was able to talk to him for a little bit. He's such a lovely man, but what else would you expect from such a lovely story? The art in this book is amazing. I couldn't be happier with it.
0307716511|5.0|Written in the form of a letter to the narrator's missing sister, Rosamund Lupton's debut novel Sister is wonderfully written and very captivating.  It works remarkably well on two separate levels.  On the one hand, the book is a solid, fascinating thriller which kept me hooked as I tried to unearth the mystery.  On the other, it is a beautiful, touching account of loss and the bonds of sisterhood and family.    The narrator is Beatrice or `Bee', who is living in New York, with a steady corporate job and an organized life.  She receives a call from her mother in England advising her that her free-spirited younger sister Tess is missing.  She immediately returns home and begins to try to trace Tess' whereabouts.  When Tess is found dead, the police are convinced that she committed suicide, using the `facts' of her life (artist, unmarried, pregnant, possibly depressed) as substantiation for their belief.  Bee however, is just as certain that Tess would never take her own life - citing her sister's reverence for life and the bond between them as her evidence.    In effect, no one believes Bee - not the police, her boyfriend or even her own mother.  As she comes up against the wall of their disbelief, Bee works harder and harder to find proof that Tess was murdered.  Much of the conflict of the book comes from this determination, as Bee struggles against both the doubts piled up by everyone connected with the case, as well as against the things she thought she knew about her sister's life.  In the end, Bee discovers that she wasn't wrong about the bond that existed between them. Instead she finds that she had looked at Tess' life as though it were the counterpoint of her own, and had judged her accordingly.  In the process of understanding her sister's life and death, Bee rediscovers her true self along the way.    In order to find the evidence to support her conviction that Tess was murdered, Bee pretty much steps into Tess' life - living in her apartment, taking a jobthat she'd once held, visiting the people and places that had been important to her, even wearing her sister's clothes.  These actions both allow Bee to understand her sister much more and also lead her to suspect several different people who were part of Tess' life.  Raising these multiple suspicions to the police, Bee appears to have become even more unstable, with almost everyone thinking that she is becoming unhinged by her sister's death.  Bee is written so believably however, that it was clear to me from the beginning that there was much more to Tess' death, and I found myself rooting for her to find the truth.    The best thing about the book for me though, was that just when I thought I understood where the story was going - though not how it would end - the author slipped in an unexpected twist.  This little gem was what elevated `Sister' from being a well-written thriller to being a stunning, captivating book that resonated with me and one that I will be hard-pressed to forget.  The book is fast-paced, but the author's elegant writing style keeps it from feeling rushed.  I must admit, I hurried through the last third of the book, when it became apparent that Bee had been keeping something important back from the story she was telling her sister.  Revelations follow one after the other in this last section of the book and both the suspense and the language made for an enjoyable and satisfying read right down to the very last page.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|Mark Johnson and company continue to amaze me.  These CD/DVD duos are masterpieces of mixing (both audio and video). As for the performances.... BRILLIANT!  The performers may be amateurs (for the most part), but they perform on a par with the very best professionals.  I found every track on these discs totally exhilarating!    I purchased a copy for each of my sons in addition to one for myself.  I encourage everyone to support the PFC movement by purchasing the music as well as clothing, bumper stickers, etc.  They are on a great mission... the least we can do is support them.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was skeptical at first whether this would be a useful app to have -- it seemed like my phone screen would be too small to be able to read well.  But I've found that reading on my 4.3 inch Droid Charge screen is no problem at all. It's also incredibly easy to buy new books.  I love having easy access to the books at any time, I love being able to read in the dark or in any amount of light (the Charge screen is good in sunlight, thankfully), I love that it keeps track of where I am in the book, and can sync me to that page if I want to read on my wife's iPad. Simply put, I love it.
140016060X|3.0|I bought this books because I saw Sir Ken's keynote at TED and was immediately hooked on the whole \\"find your passion\\" idea. The book provides great examples about people from different walks of life who, by chance or otherwise, have found their Element. It also helps dispel doubts you may have about not being able to find your Element (thinks like \\"I'm too old, too busy, too whatever...\\") with the stories of people who not only found their Element but overcame tragedy, like Robinson himself.    What the book does NOT do is tell us how to find OUR Element... and this is a sad thing. Maybe I was misled by the title but I did find it sad and disappointing that not a piece of how-to information was shared regarding the subject of \\"finding\\" our Element. I did learn one important bit of information: I'm not in my Element, and that at least tells me I have to move on... but the question remains. How?    If you want a motivating read about people who have overcome disabilities, tragedy and social and family pressures to reach fame and success then this book is definitely for you. But if you want information on HOW to find your passion and be in The Element, then I think you should look somewhere else.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was an amazing ending to the trilogy. I loved the first 2 and I read the third one in record time. The characters get to be confusing because most of the characters from the first 2 books come back as well as new characters that were introduced in this one. I also thought that the end could have been different, I dont want to give it up, but the relationship of Blomkvist and Salander are left out in the open.

B004XIQDYW|5.0|I've been an Arctic Monkeys fan since WPSIATWIN, but I gotta say I love their newer stuff. Every album is just growth. Take the dark musical maturity of Humbug and make it a poppy summer love album and you essentially have this album. There are hints of Favorite Worst Nightmare in Library Pictures, and the closer that gives me shivers That's Where Your Wrong has that building progression like 505 or A Certain Romance, but truely this album is it's own entity.    Note: I bought the Vinyl which is entirely without flaw, and meets all the supreme standards of excellence. Album artwork is hilarious.

B001LRJH0U|5.0|I FOUND THIS DVD FOR $5 AT A LOCAL STORE. I was going to return it because i read the reviews on amazon and several people beat down the movie. I decided to keep it and experiment and watch it. WOW! This is one of the best westerns i have ever watched. It is as good as PALE RIDER, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, HANG EM HIGH, THE SHOOTIST, SONS OF KATIE ELDER, THE COWBOYS, SILVERADO, MCKENNAS GOLD ETC..... The only bettter westerns are OUTLAW JOSEY WALES, TOMBSTONE, UNFORGIVEN with CLINT EASTWOOD, FIST FULL OF DOLLARS, A FEW DOLLARS MORE. Great and accurate to the time costumes, great sets, great acting, great music, and great extras on dvd. The very opening scene is violent and bad as HELL! It starts with shooting and it ends with a shootout. Anybody who does not like this movie is either squeemish or just does not know the real west and is looking for a 21st century view of the old west instead of this gritty, dusty and accurate movie. Some people just can't handle the brutality and violence.
0762439009|5.0|The coffee mug and mouse pad alone are worth the price of this kit. I mouse pad really ties my desk together. The mug is in regular rotation with my favorite coffee mugs.

I feel that any die hard Lebowski fan would be satisfied with this purchase.
0385737955|4.0|This was such a fun book to read. Immediately you get sucked into this world that holds so many surprises. Each chapter ends with you wondering what's going to happen next, requiring you to read on!  I couldn't put it down until it was finished and then went and bought the next book.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is probably the best book I've ever read! I fell in love with Travis's character. I could see how much he was completely in love with Abby, and it was amazing. I cried a lot when I read it, and stayed up until 3 am, and 4 am reading it. Although I hated Abby at some times, I feel she made good decisions in the end. I got mad at her so many times for denying her love for Travis. They fought a lot, it was a hate-love relationship, and I loved it! But this book is definitely a MUST READ.
B003UESJHY|4.0|The movie itself gets 5 stars from me, but there are very few special features. Deleted scenes, making of, commentary, and trailer. If youre getting this for the movie then its great. But since I really love special features this gets 4 stars.
0307389839|5.0|One of the best books on running .. I received this as a gift, and have since given it to several friends who run. Murakami's writing style is great, and he \\"gets\\" what it is to run, especially run long.
0743539133|5.0|Narration is clear; varied inflection interesting; diction crisp; pace is neither too slow nor too fast.  Conclusion:  Well read.         Content:  Material is interesting and informative.  I am going to read other books by this political historian.         Minor personal preference:  I would like the narration even more if the narrator's register were just a bit deeper.  Richard Thomas does a very good job, but I would prefer a voice just a bit deeper.
B003VANOFY|3.0|It's really a decent product for the most part. But, I cannot call this a gaming headset.    Pros:    - Excellent range, over 30+ feet.  - Decent battery life, lasts around 7 hours.  - Looks nice, really well made.  - You can't hear any outside noise.    Cons:    - Sound quality is junky for gaming. Sound quality is 16bit audio, up to 48000 Hz.  - Microphone is junky as well. 16bit audio, 16000 Hz.  - Charger stand is a pain. The cable is very short. I still cannot figure out why they didn't just give us an plain cord to charge it  - 7.1 Surround sound is a joke in this headset, I won't say more than that.  - The ear padding is hard. I have many ear piercings though, might just be me.  - Bass is distorted, works in the most non-favorable way, you cannot hear critical sounds while playing most games.. such as footsteps, etc.    I would have given the product a 2, but it's really well-made. For gaming, stay away from it. If your using Skype, or voice software it's ideal.  The corded version is a godly headset, best quaility I have ever heard as far as headsets go. They are way cheaper as well.
B0027YTYW2|5.0|The Very Hungry Catepillar is a classic, but timely story that still entertains while teaching several lessons. It can be used to show the scientific process of a butterfly's development in a matter that very young kids can understand; teach the days of the week; teach sequence of events; used in churches to show steps of salvation--how we become new creatures in Christ. Children and adults love this well-written tale.
0756404738|3.0|The book is actually well done for the first half.  Then the story becomes a meandering mess.  At the half way point, and for a couple of hundred pages, the hero and his group wander around telling pointless tales and stories that have nothing to do with the story (is this just a way to make sure the book is a 1,000 pages long?). Then it is off to bizarro world (err fairy land) where the hero wanders around naked, having oodles of sex with a fairy, talking to trees, and listening to more pointless tales.  Once back, he wanders off with a strange mercenary and tries to learn his goofy religion/philosophy (more boring, pointless tales and pontificating). The story really loses its appeal as the plot becomes pretty much random and the characters are no longer interesting. I got to about the 3/4 mark and had had enough.<br /><br />Oh well, the new Martin book will be out soon, I'll wait for that.
1593272839|5.0|Properly learning Haskell has been on my todo list for years. One of my first more serious attempts was in 2009, when I found a weird little book with lots of cartoons online. As you may have guessed that was Miran Lipovaca's \\"Learn You a Haskell for Great Good\\" and I was immediately intrigued by the writing style and cute cartoons. However back then the book was still a work in progress and I eventually stopped reading it before Miran got around to adding the last chapters. I always promised myself to eventually revisit this later, so I was delighted when I found out that No Starch Press is actually releasing an offline version of the book!<br /><br />LYAH definitely is among the top programming books I read so far. Due to the author's easy-going and funny style -- though I'm sure there will be some readers who won't appreciate his humor -- you might not even notice at first how choke-full of good content this book is, but once you are done with it you realize that you actually learned a lot. This would be an amazing feat for any technical book, but is even more impressive considering Haskell's reputation as being a very academical and arcane language. Sure, not everything is covered here -- Arrows or CPS come to mind -- but every book is finite and the selection of topics is absolutely appropriate for beginning Haskell enthusiasts. The only chapter I wasn't so happy with was the last one on Zippers, not because it wasn't well written or interesting, but more because it felt a bit tucked on.<br /><br />What can you expect from this book? Will you be a Haskell guru after reading it? Most likely not, because that takes a long time of practice and actually writing code. Maybe that's one of the few weak points of LYAH, the code examples are usually rather short and focussed on getting the point across, not \\"real-world\\" tasks you are likely to encounter in day to day programming. They still are great for introducing the reader to Haskell's way of abstracting problems, which I find immensely beautiful and well thought out. Still, a chapter or two on \\"programming in the large\\" and how to structure a big Haskell project would have been nice additions, but there are other places for learning more about the language, e.g. the Haskell wiki or the Haskell Wikibook. What the book will do for you is that once you are done with it, you should have a good basic understanding of the language's key concepts and type system and will be comfortable around terms like \\"monoid\\", \\"applicative functor\\" and \\"monad\\". There still we be a long way to go before you can consider yourself a Haskell expert, but you'll have a very solid grounding to build on.<br /><br />All in all this is a remarkable book and maybe just what this beautiful language was missing, an easy to read, entertaining yet still thorough introduction to the language, that gives you an idea that Haskell is not only a research subject for computer scientists but a useful tool that can be used to build software.nsely beautiful and well thought out.

B00002R0MC|4.0|I found out about this album through Pandora. After searching for it on Amazon, i found out it was a four cd set. This is an excellent introduction into Bob Marley, as the compilation contains his early as well as later work. If you would like to learn more about Bob Marley's music, this is a definite must buy. Oh, i was surprised though that the case itself and the cd covers were made out of cardboard. i would have preferred some type of jewel case, other than that it is great.

B0035WTE2U|4.0|AC/DC have studiously avoided releasing any kind of best of or greatest hits albums, much to the consternation of many a record executive. In fact, at the time of this posting, they remain one of the last remaining holdouts among the major bands to refuse to put their songs on download sites. Which makes their decision to release their songs as a companion to \\"Iron Man 2\\" as close to an ersatz best of than \\"Who Made Who\\" (the soundtrack to superfan Stephen King's \\"Maximum Overdrive\\" flick) was in 1986.<br /><br />The good thing about the \\"Iron Man 2\\" soundtrack is that AC/DC have been steadily making albums since \\"Who Made Who,\\" and that was when releases were still being created with 12 inch vinyl in mind. Also, at the time of \\"Who made Who,\\" AC/DC were at a creative stall with the albums \\"Fly On The Wall\\" and \\"Flick of The Switch.\\" They regained their momentum for the next set of albums including \\"Razor's Edge\\" and \\"Black Ice.\\" That gave the man at Marvel over two more decades of Angus, Malcolm, Bon and Brian to pick from, along with all that extra space on CD to fill.<br /><br />The payoff is pretty darn good. That divides up into 6 cuts for Bon Scott and 9 for Brian Johnson. Amazingly, there are no crossovers from \\"Who Made Who\\" and that leaves off some obvious favorites like \\"For Those About to Rock\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long.\\" There are still plenty of rocking staples to be found here, ala \\"T.N.T.,\\" \\"Thunderstruck,\\" \\"Highway To Hell\\" and \\"Back In Black.\\" But there's also a few picks that defy expectations, like \\"Cold Hearted Man's\\" first showing on a proper AC/DC single disc, or \\"War Machine\\" from \\"Black Ice.\\" The riffage is heavy and the aim is hard.<br /><br />Given that \\"Iron Man 2\\" is a movie that runs mostly on explosion and testosterone, that meant that such efforts as \\"Caught With Your Pants Down,\\" \\"Big Balls,\\" \\"Sink The Pink\\" or other sophomoric jokes were passed over in favor of \\"Shoot To Thrill,\\" \\"Thunderstruck\\" or other combat ready guitar blasters. It centers the CD and gives it, even with the shuffling of songs between Brian Johnson and Bon Scott, a feeling of cohesion. After all, AC/DC has a rep for being ballbusting hard rockers, and this riff-tastic package flies right to the heart of that assertion. Perfect for road trips or keggers, AC/DC's \\"Iron Man 2\\" makes an excellent bookmark into the band's almost 40 years of rocking.D and gives it, even with the shuffling of songs between Brian Johnson and Bon Scott, a feeling of cohesion.

B00365EB88|4.0|AC/DC have studiously avoided releasing any kind of best of or greatest hits albums, much to the consternation of many a record executive. In fact, at the time of this posting, they remain one of the last remaining holdouts among the major bands to refuse to put their songs on download sites. Which makes their decision to release their songs as a companion to \\"Iron Man 2\\" as close to an ersatz best of than \\"Who Made Who\\" (the soundtrack to superfan Stephen King's \\"Maximum Overdrive\\" flick) was in 1986.<br /><br />The good thing about the \\"Iron Man 2\\" soundtrack is that AC/DC have been steadily making albums since \\"Who Made Who,\\" and that was when releases were still being created with 12 inch vinyl in mind. Also, at the time of \\"Who made Who,\\" AC/DC were at a creative stall with the albums \\"Fly On The Wall\\" and \\"Flick of The Switch.\\" They regained their momentum for the next set of albums including \\"Razor's Edge\\" and \\"Black Ice.\\" That gave the man at Marvel over two more decades of Angus, Malcolm, Bon and Brian to pick from, along with all that extra space on CD to fill.<br /><br />The payoff is pretty darn good. That divides up into 6 cuts for Bon Scott and 9 for Brian Johnson. Amazingly, there are no crossovers from \\"Who Made Who\\" and that leaves off some obvious favorites like \\"For Those About to Rock\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long.\\" There are still plenty of rocking staples to be found here, ala \\"T.N.T.,\\" \\"Thunderstruck,\\" \\"Highway To Hell\\" and \\"Back In Black.\\" But there's also a few picks that defy expectations, like \\"Cold Hearted Man's\\" first showing on a proper AC/DC single disc, or \\"War Machine\\" from \\"Black Ice.\\" The riffage is heavy and the aim is hard.<br /><br />Given that \\"Iron Man 2\\" is a movie that runs mostly on explosion and testosterone, that meant that such efforts as \\"Caught With Your Pants Down,\\" \\"Big Balls,\\" \\"Sink The Pink\\" or other sophomoric jokes were passed over in favor of \\"Shoot To Thrill,\\" \\"Thunderstruck\\" or other combat ready guitar blasters. It centers the CD and gives it, even with the shuffling of songs between Brian Johnson and Bon Scott, a feeling of cohesion. After all, AC/DC has a rep for being ballbusting hard rockers, and this riff-tastic package flies right to the heart of that assertion.

B0058VW36U|5.0|I was introduced to this game while watching a nephew (aged 4) play it on an iPad. He had played through a ton of levels and was still going. I thought that meant it would be super easy, but in reality it showed the depth of the gameplay: almost anyone can enjoy this game. Worth the dollar.
0938045695|4.0|Much better than expected.  I've paid for 1:1 kettlebell instruction from a personal trainer, and this book is more detailed, and proving more effective in practice.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase, and I'm actually using what I learn in every workout.    You have to read the whole book - and then read it again, and nibble at bits and pieces.  It is not written in the usual style of leading the reader step by step through an exercise routine.  I've had some exposure to CrossFit, so I don't need that level of handholding with kettlebells, but others might.  In that case, you'll probably want to get the DVD, or watch videos on the 'net.    Yes, there's a lot of advertising, but it's collected in the back of the book and doesn't bother me at all.    The one major annoyance is that the photos depicting what NOT to do aren't clearly distinguished from those demonstrating good form - you need to read the text very carefully (by every single image) to figure out which is which.  It gets old.  A simple, light X through each \\"wrong\\" photo would have been a useful visual cue:  \\"don't do this.\\"
B004HZ76FQ|3.0|I'm not a fisherman. That may be why I enjoyed this game just not as much as a lot of the reviewers here. It is fun to cast your line and catch a fish. The thing is that it gets repetitive quick. It reminded me of catching fish in Animal Crossing: throw, wait for nibble, pull, reel, and repeat. If fishing is your thing get this game. It is well done and detailed. If you are like me, get a different game with more variety.
B0032UYFA6|4.0|I didn't find season 3 as engaging as previous years.  Bouncy handheld shots and silly camera angles-e.g. from the bottom of a pot of boiling water or from inside a chemical vat-were annoying. (These may not be new quirks but became more obvious to me.) Walt becomes less sympathetic as his psychopathology becomes more apparent.  If you doubt the guy is a nutter, check out his speech to the school assembly and his emotional detachment generally.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Unlike Peggle, I got into this game on Android then downloaded it on Xbox Live. I wish they talked to each other and shared levels and progression!<br /><br />This is the ultimate pick up and play game. I love Angry Birds but there is only so much you can do with a slingshot and a bird. With PvZ you get a ton of different levels with different weapons (plants) and unending challenge. A great game!<br /><br />My only complaint: Why the WiFi only? Amazon should give us the option. I have Verizon's 4G LTE and could have downloaded this faster on my Thunderbolt than on my home WiFi.
B0006VBFM0|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend who loves colors, so this was the perfect watch for her. It is manufactured by a great brand and it comes at a reasonable price. The only negative is the lack of \\"date keeper\\". The numbers on the dial are big and easy to read. It is a great casual watch with bright colors and looks plain \\"fun\\". My girlfriend absolutely loves it and never takes it off.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Having never read the books, I watched the first episode and was thinking \\"this is ok\\" until the ending came.  I couldn't wait to see what happened in the next episode and was hooked.  I did have to go back and watch the first few episodes again to get the names down (there are a lot of them) but that just gave me an excuse to watch this excellent show again.  I'm am now on the third time watching and have also started reading the books.  April cannot come soon enough!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Why do I have to wait so long for day three.  I thought the Name of the Wind was the best book I ever read but the thoughtfulness and depth of the Wise Mans Fears is just amazing.  Never has there been a better writer. Brilliant.
0425241505|5.0|I swear this book is the magical love child that came from a brief fling between J.R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood & Kerrelyn Sparks' Love at Stake series!! (and I'm completely smitten with it)<br /><br />First, I loved Pia right off the bat! You can just tell that there's something special about her. Her attitude & street smarts instantly had me rooting for her, that and I really just wanted to see her show up her ex-boyfriend. I am really, who blackmails their ex? Oh that's right, a dirt ball with a gambling problem, that's who!<br />After she steals from Dragos, an uber hot Wry-Dragon with a grumpy attitude, she flees for her life. Because as much fun as being torn limb from limb sounds, she's happy with where they are now. With the help of her sexy boss Quentin, she drops everything she knows and heads for an Elven demesne where she'll be safe. (Oh hunny, if only books worked that way!) Needless to say Dragos catches up to her and is determined to bring justice upon her...hehe...<br />As their apparent attraction turns into a red hot passion, Dragos must learn to keep Pia safe. Along with now trying to balance his life, work and guards, his enemies know that he's found something special, something that they will do just about anything to get their hands onto.<br />'<br />Absolutely flipping fantastic!! There's laugh out loud humor, that's a mix of my kind of name calling, with straight up sarcasm. Ms. Harrison did an excellent job of creating just the right balance of characters without it becoming overwhelming. Mixing magic, Fae and Wry, Dragon Bound blew my expectations out of the water! So now the bar for this series has been set, very high, and I'm hoping that Ms. Harrison can continue to write as superbly as she did in Dragon Bound!<br /><br />5/5

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I rarely write book reviews, although I read many books.  This is an exception because it is an account of amazing bravery, written in a style which captures the reader's emotions until the last line of text.  I can only say that every American should read this book and understand that it is just one record of the ultimate dedication which service men and women have given to this country from its beginning.  There are similar accounts of heroism for every conflict, but this one is in such graphic detail that it stands out.  It's a high benchmark by which future books will be measured, for me.    I have thought about the men and events in this book every day since I finished reading it.    If you have any interest in military history, buy it now.  If you have any interest in knowing about the men who serve as \\"SEALs\\", buy it now.  If you have ever wanted to know what courage looks like, buy it now.
B00000F566|5.0|This one of my all time faves!!  This movie was soooo great.  (not mention very hot.)  Everyone should see it if they have a chance!
0439023521|5.0|I purchased this book because of all the hype I'd been hearing about it, and I must say, it did not disappoint. I finished the whole trilogy over the course of 3 days because it is, without a doubt, an edge-of-your seat thriller.    Many people have voiced concerns about the brutality of the book, it is gory, it is graphic, and it is slightly disturbing. That's the point. The author is making a show of what war-torn and violent countries are like for children. People rage on about the violence in \\"The Hunger Games\\" and how it disturbed them, apparently forgetting that there are parts of the world where children (younger then 12, mind you) are actually given weapons and told to kill or be killed. Yes, this book will stick with you. Yes, I have had continued strange and disturbing dreams because of it, but that does not negate its merit as a good or worthwhile book and I'm still glad I read it.    The setting is not far removed from many dystopian futures, and I cannot speak to the similarities mentioned between this series and some international books, but this one is a good read, it's exciting, the characters are interesting, the setting isn't too far from home and you will not be able to put it down until you get to the end.    No, some of the characters are not particularly likeable, the protagonist included. I, personally, tend to like having a main character who has motives and actions that I question, it makes it interesting. You don't have to love Katniss all the time, and you probably won't, but that doesn't make her unworthy or her story less thrilling, and even when you don't like her, there are many other much more likeable characters to cling to.    I wouldn't recommend this for younger children. It is a bit brutal in places, but for older kids, upper middle school/high school, I think it would be great. I'm a graduate student with a soft spot for young adult fiction, and I really enjoyed it, if \\"enjoy\\" is the appropriate word for things like this.     Basically, this is a quick read, but one that will stay with you for a long time, be prepared to be shocked, disturbed and occasionally disappointed. You will not regret reading it, but you certainly won't forget it.
0671027344|5.0|I borrowed and read this book years back and i loved it.  I brought it this time and im so glad to have my own copy its a brilliant book!
1400052181|5.0|I cannot talk about books that generate an interest in science without talking about this book. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks has received endless acclaim and praise, is currently selling at position #17 among Amazon's books, and was voted the #1 book of 2010 by Amazon's editors; there isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said. Even still, I encourage you to pick up this book if you haven't already.      Interestingly, I almost never read nonfiction. Ninety-nine out of 100 books that I read will be fiction, but this book would have to be that 1 in 100 that isn't. I am actually reading this book currently, and it's my own fault for not starting it sooner. I received the book as a gift over a year ago, and I must guiltily admit that I shelved it in favor of my usual fiction...until I saw that it was Amazon's editors' pick of the year. But honestly, it shouldn't have taken that much for me to give the book a try, because the synopsis is as compelling and original as any fiction -- except that it's real, and relevant to my work as a scientist.    This book tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, a Black woman who worked tobacco fields in Virginia in the 1930s and 40s. A poor woman with only a middle school education, Henrietta stoically faced a diagnosis of cervical cancer while striving to continue in her role as a wife and mother of five. Little did she or her family know that a sample of her cervical cancer would revolutionize research science by providing the first human cells to ever grow indefinitely in culture - an immortal cell line. Unfortunately, that fact spoke to the aggressiveness of Henrietta's cancer, which killed her at the young age of 30 in 1951. What her family didn't know, however, was that the cells of their beloved Henrietta lived on...and on, and on, and on. HeLa (Henrietta Lacks) cells were and still are bought and sold widely within the scientific community and have enabled numerous discoveries, including the polio vaccine and, somewhat ironically, advances in chemotherapy. I entreat you to imagine her family's surprise and outrage when they finally were informed of all that had been accomplished with Henrietta's cells - when they themselves were too poor to afford a doctor's visit. So much more than just a biography, this book has pleasantly surprised me thus far with the honest, candid account that the author gives of her own challenges as an upper-middle class White woman attempting to tease out the details of this sensitive subject from Henrietta's family and friends.    Some call Henrietta Lacks the most important woman in medical history. What I know is that I can probably get up right now and go find a vial of her cells in some freezer on the very floor where I do my work, as could just about every research scientist. It goes without saying that this is a book that every researcher should read, but anyone who has ever taken their own cells for granted will find this an eye-opening read.

0142418471|4.0|I didn't know what to make of this book. It was honest refreshing and funny. Some books you just have to read to understand.
1439102813|5.0|When I stand in front of my bookshelf, my eyes return to this book more than most, and I think that fact speaks to the power this book has. I recently posted about research on neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's, and this book does an impressive job of bringing the reader into the world of Alzheimer's Disease. Still Alice at times seems almost too real, and I'm guessing that's because the novel was written by Harvard-trained neuroscientist Lisa Genova, whose own grandmother suffered with Alzheimer's.      Clearly inspired by her personal experiences, Genova`s novel centers around Alice: Harvard psychology professor, wife, and mother. At 50 years of age she is highly respected amongst her colleagues as a world-renowned linguistics expert, and her problems seem no worse than would be expected - she wants to find more time to spend with her husband, and one of her three adult children wants to move to L.A. and take her chances on acting. However, when Alice starts forgetting little things here and there, like where she last had her Blackberry (and who doesn't have this problem on occasion?), she tries to explain it away as menopause or maybe even a brain tumor. What she doesn't expect is to be diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's Disease, which rapidly progresses and devastates her mental function.    Ultimately losing her professorship and the ability to recognize her family, Lisa Genova`s Alice might bring you to tears, but in some ways that's the point, and Genova has done her job - she makes you aware of the reality of this heartbreaking disease, and convinces you that it could happen to anyone at any level of society. For less than $5, it's worth getting this novel for the appreciation it gives you towards neurodegeneration research. And maybe it will be as unforgettable an addition to your bookshelf as it was to mine.      For more compelling, current, and comprehensible content on the latest disease research, TRY NERDY - [...]
0062009540|2.0|Just by looking at the title you automatically know what the book is going to be about\\" a bunch of rich barbies that have little dirty secrets. That is the problem though: none of the characters have any qualities that would make you care for them. Personally, i didn't give a rat's ass as to what happened to the characters. They were all just stuck-up teenagers that fool around with sex and drugs. I read this short book and it took me forever because I just couldn't bring myself to care about finishing it. And the end is unsatisfying, granted it is a series so that is very understandable. But as read the next book and the next hoping to at least get some clarity as to what's going on, you find that none of your questions are answered and it is just the same thing happening again and again and again. I will admit to watching the TV show and enjoying it (enough for maybe 3.5 stars), but this is not as good. Don't waste your time or money.
0061650498|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a member of that very small, elite club \\"My Favorite Books of All Time;\\" these are the books I have read numerous times, and will doubtless read numerous times again before I die.  From the very first time I read ATGIB at age 11, it was firmly ensconsed as one of my all-time faves, and that position has remained unshaken in the ensuing 30+ years.<br /><br />I first obtained ATGIB through a free book give-away program at the poor, rural school I attended (back in the 1970s), and I can still remember so much about that very first reading -- for instance, that much of it was on a 10-hour long Greyhound bus ride.  It was an impressionable and difficult age for me, which no doubt accounts for the very strong and indelible impression that ATGIB made on my psyche.  I connected and identified strongly with Francie Nolan, and identified her parents with my own (and still do even now).<br /><br />I honestly don't know how many times I've read ATGIB:  enough that I have most of the scenes and narrative practically memorized.  It is a beautiful story, if a melancholy and bittersweet one, from beginning to end.  Amazingly, I identify Francie and her family with me and my own even more now as an adult than I did as a young girl.  I find the book more poignant and touching every time I read it.<br /><br />A few years ago I obtained this audio version (which I am now listening to for the second time) and it is superb.  Kate Burton's narration is incredibly good, and she makes this wonderful classic even better.  She captures the myriad of accents -- German, Irish, Brooklynese -- with perfect pitch.<br /><br />I can't recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn enough; although I think it might be primarily a women's book, I do think it could have some appeal for men, as well.

0553582038|3.0|Frustrating is all I can say after slogging thru this book. Such promise in the first couple of books, but he deserts the characters we care about, I guess winterfell goes empty & I read endless stories of minor characters with crazy names the author relishes. I hope they change the story & keep more focus on the HBO version because the way the author kills off everything you start to care about the show won't last. More stark, white walkers, lannister & danerys please.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The photographs in the book were great and added to the story in that you could see what the characters looked like and some of what they were referring too.  The ending was ok, but too quick.  It left me wondering what would happen next.  I hated to see it end and am only hoping that Mr. Riggs will write another book to follow up on this one.  My only issue with the kindle version was the pictures of written letters.  I couldn't figure out how to make them larger so I could read them better.  Changing the font size only worked on the text.  Could be I haven't found all of the ways I can manipulate things on my kindle or my eye's are getting old.  :D

B001684L0A|5.0|There's not a lot to say other than all Americans and those who wish to be should see this movie. From all my research, much of the known story-line is accurate. At the same time it educates one about one of our nation's primary Founders, it's also entertaining, very well acted, and a joy to watch.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This movie is based on the book Killer Angels. It focuses on the key battle of the war. It focuses on a few key people whose decisions and actions in the heat of battle made a key difference to the outcome of the battle and the war. It points out what a near thing the outcome of this battle was. It almost seems that some other higher power was at work to tip the balance of power in favor of the Union. Buford and Chamberlain were key cogs in the wheel without whom the battle would probably have a different outcome. We owe a lot to these 2 men.
1417732474|5.0|The Lightning Thief is the first book in a 5 book set called Percy Jackson and the Olympians.  The book is ranged for grades 5-9 (age 9-12) but just like Harry Potter, it is a book that can span all ages.  With simple writing and a fast pace flow, \\"The Lightning Thief\\" ends up becoming a classic fantasy book about Greek Mythology, adventure and mystery; perfect for kids and adults.    Without giving away any of the storyline(Simplified):  The Lightning Thief is about a boy named Percy Jackson, whom at first seems like an average kid.  It doesn't take long for the pacing to pick up, and the fantasy begins as it turns out Percy is a demigod; the offspring of a Greek God.  However Percy is different than all the other demigod's out there, a rare demigod you could say.  This makes him a target not only of other gods but of monsters that roam the world.  To make matters worse a crime has been committed in Olympus and Percy is framed!  Thus starts an epic quest for Percy to set out and clear his name while trying to restore order in Olympus before war breaks out amongst the gods.    Despite being designed as a book for kids, it can easily be enjoyed by adults.  The story is written so that it is extremely easy to follow while remaining a bit of a mystery as to what is going on.  All the clues are there but like any good mystery it might be difficulty to piece them together.  The pacing of the book also works in its favor.  There are almost no dull parts to speak of.  This is 375 pages(Library Bound edition) of adventure and action flowing nonstop.  I found once I started to read the book I just could not put it down, breezing through it in three casual sittings, with every page and chapter drawing me in more and more.  It was very hard to put the book down, and I am sure kids will be even more obsessed!    OVERALL this is a great book to own and/or read.  I love Greek Mythology and Rick Riordan manages to revive the mythology in a perfect way for kids, while giving everything its own modern spin.  While the book is adventurous and exciting there is also an educational element here...helping kids learn a little more about ancient Greek mythology.  A simple, easy to follow story that has almost no dull moments, easy to follow dialogue and a great feeling of fantasy, mythology and adventure all wrapped into one; This is a book well worth reading!    *NOTE: I received my copy as part of a Library/School Bound Hardcover Boxset.  The Library bound hardcover is excellent quality with an extremely durable binding.  The pages are thicker than normal to resist tearing and the print is in easy to read, large font.  ISBN: 978-078685629-9
0345529057|4.0|Just received my order after a super fast shipment (less than 10 days, for shipment from US to Greece, while the estimated time was about 25 days).<br /><br />The book size a little smaller than the one I was expected. As you can see on my photos the size is 17,5cm x 10,5cm x 3,5cm. Something like a pocket-size book for the beach. No problem with that, cause thats exactly the way Im gonna use them anyway. The covers are thin but with nice embossed heading on them.<br /><br />Now about the inside of each book. I didnt find any missing pages that I heard a lot about, so thats a good thing. The quality of the paper is just the basic (Mass Market). The feel on the hand its kinda harsh like a newspaper and by any means NOT water resistant. Small margins dont let you write any kind of notes on them, but again remember its just a  book for the beach.<br /><br />At last some words for the quality of package in general. Although my order arrived in a big mail sack in which there was the actual parcel, my box set was obviously ..afflicted. The corners of the box were smitten and the cartons were ripped on one side (check photo). I cant blame openly amazon for this cause I can understand that the distance between US and Greece is big enough to preserve the finest quality at the cheapest shipment option (Standard International Trackless Shipment), but maybe some more strong package may be needed for long distances like mine.<br /><br />To conclude, this box set its obviously NOT for collectors. Its a cheap paperback version for some vacation reading (low weight and small size makes its perfect for it) for those, like me, who just want to read the whole story all in one box set at a great price.<br /><br />PS: For me, it just costed 20EUR with shipment included, while on Greek market you can find the translated editions at 25 EUR per book(!).

B000JML7YC|3.0|Jane Austen takes a good-natured poke at her contemporary authors-of-a-certain genre, and the people (young, impressionable ladies) who read them, in this little late-19th-century gem. I enjoyed the indirect way she draws the characters of the devious Isabella and her money-hungry family. From a historian's viewpoint, the descriptions of vacationers in Bath and of the Abbey are fascinating.
1594744769|4.0|This book was not what I expected it to be. First off, the book is in a totally different genre than what I usually read, and oddly enough I loved it. I was unable to put the book down; there were lots of twists and turns that kept me hungry for more. There were points in the story where I was positive of what the outcomes were going to be, but the plot ended up going in a totally different direction from what I had originally thought. Most of all, I loved the photos the author included in the book; they really helped me visualize the 'peculiars' much easier and gave the book a unique personality.    The reason I only give the book four stars is mainly because of the ending. I remember when I was finishing it, I jumped up in my chair and shouted, \\"That's it?! That's how it ends?! You can't be serious...\\" Personally, I thought the ending was a bit rushed and left off on an interesting cliff hanger where the it seemed like the author had just stopped writing like in a way that you would end a chapter.    Overall, I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who was interested.
B000TGJ80S|4.0|While some are keen on pointing out the great departure from Bram Stoker's novel, I seem to take a different point of view. The writer added a key element that makes this telling of Dracula different: the addition of romance. One of the key lines of the film was \\"Love Never Dies\\" and it works well for this telling. But enough about this.     True fans of this movie want to know what's included. For one, the case is beautifully done. And the second disk gives you a lot of behind the scenes looks at how the movie was made. It also includes some interviews with the cast and crew. This is a definate must-have for Dracula fans.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|This album rocks. Its anothere great work. I really like Dream Theater. In this album they are very melodically , they play progressive metal (not so complicated as in previous albums = You can hear them even if you are not a musician). They have a huge song Ocavarium which sounds like Pink Floyd trying to play progressive metal - It is a very very good one. If you are a fan of them then this is a must buy - if you are new then this is also a good album and consider having and their previous albums and especially Images and Words - Awake - Train Of Thought. These albums are masterpieces. And the rest albums are very good.
B003EYVXSW|3.0|This was, for lack of a better word, different....or just plain weird? I saw the trailer and, being a biologist myself, thought it would be right up my alley. This was a lot more science fiction than what I was hoping for but it does raise a lot of questions about the implications of DNA research. Afterwards, it really makes you wonder what kinds of research are being done out of the public eye. It's definately worth watching, but certain parts are not for the faint of heart....trust me.
0756404738|4.0|[[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]] by Patrick Rothfuss has been one of the best fantasy books I've read in the last five years, however I was initially hesitant to try the sequel after seeing a mediocre rating on Amazon.  Fortunately I picked it up anyway, and although the majority of the reviews on Amazon have merit, I am glad I read it and definitely think it's a good book when looked on as a part of the trilogy instead of a stand alone novel.  The reason I have given it only four stars, is because I don't believe anyone buying this book would purchase it if they hadn't read The Name of the Wind (and you shouldn't, because you won't understand anything).  As such, it has enough faults in it that I can't give it the same rating that I did the first book.  That being said, it is still thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />The main character, Kvothe, continues his adventures from the first book as he studies at the University and does a lot more traveling.  This is basically a collection of mini adventures, with every 50 pages or so bringing a new adventure.  The main criticism I have with it, like others, is that the story hardly progresses at all.  The Chandrian, who made such an interesting antagonist in the first book, is still shrouded in mystery and the new information learned about them in this book could fit in a single paragraph.  There is no advancement along that storyline, which means that Rothfuss is going to have a lot of work to do in the third book.  Kvothe only makes minor progress at the University, and only improves slightly at his ability at naming.  His relationship with Dena is still pretty much the same by the end of the book, although there is potential for me. Another thing I noticed about this book and was slightly taken back by, is how much killing Kvothe does.  Toward the end of the book, there are two chapters where he kills dozens of people, and it just didn't fit with the character that had been developed thus far.  I recognized that it was necessary and he does express regret for it later, but it just seemed out of character.<br /><br />Criticisms aside, this book would have worked much better as part of the original book instead of by itself. It's much more of a continuation (albeit a very long one) of the first story as we wait for something exciting to happen in the next book.  I'm glad I read it, and would still recommend it to fans of The Name of the Wind, with the caution for them not to expect too many mysteries to be revealed just yet.r.

B002O3Z4W0|5.0|This was the movie that set me on my current path of vampire fanatic. I first saw it when I was about 10 or 11 and read the book shortly thereafter. It's beautifully shot with a lot of special effects that could go seemingly unnoticed if you didn't know where to look because they blended so well with the actual sets and props. This is probably one of the best book to movie adaptations I've seen and it's all because Anne Rice wrote the script. She was able to have complete freedom in what was and was not included. This is my all time favorite movie.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|This is one of the few movies that seriously scared me. I saw it in theaters and now I am going to buy it on blu-ray so I can keep it for myself and be thrilled all over again. If you're looking for a good scare, you won't be disappointed in this movie!

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I thought this was a good read and enjoyed the photographs very much but was disappointed in the abrupt ending.  Hopefully the sequel is on the way.  Kind of felt like a book written for YAs.
B004UBB3KQ|4.0|Great album. Their songs are very catchy and it definitely is the summer jam for this year. I love how easily you could pick up and just start dancing around. I don't know much about Foster the People, since I just started listening to them earlier this year, but from what I kept hearing on MTV (where I originally found out about them from) I quickly fell in love with their catchy tunes. They remind me a great deal of Passion Pit mixed in with Vampire Weekend. The eclectic alternative rock is in. My favorite is definitely \\"Houdini\\" and \\"I Would Do Anything for You.\\" If you're looking for a good summer album, this is one to add onto the collection! Only 4 stars since many of their songs sounds too similar and they seem to have the same sounds as a lot of bands out there today.
0345529057|5.0|One of the best series I've ever read. Went through these books pretty fast despite their length the story is better than the lord of the rings series.

0307716511|4.0|The whole time I was reading this very well-written novel, I kept trying to figure out who did it and why.  I figured that out along the way, but I really didn't see the ending coming ~ it was a total surprise.  That said, I can't really say that I liked the ending, which is the reason I gave this book 4 stars rather than 5.  For a first novel it was extremely well done.  I look forward to seeing what this author comes up with next.
B00008O31H|5.0|When Brothers came out, I was moderately impressed.  But that was my introduction to the Black Keys.  I didn't buy the album of Brothers, but instead individual tracks.  But Thickfreakness is awesome.  It's gritty (sounds like the entire album was recorded in a dank bar with 12 people in it and a waitress that doesn't want to be there), funky (there are times where it sounds like Jimmy Hendrix was a strong influence), and really fun to listen to.  If you are driving and listening to this, it will be impossible to not play drums on the steering wheel - impossible.
0446401307|3.0|The Overlook is the author's 13th Harry Bosch novel. If you are unfamiliar with Harry, he is an LAPD homicide detective - dogged, independent, not real good with authority and from a reader's perspective - very likeable. This all without being stereotypical, predictable and becoming stale - Hence the continued success of the series.     In this adventure Harry - with a brand new partner - is tasked with solving what initially appears to be an execution-style murder. The investigation soon becomes more complicated when the FBI becomes involved - including a female federal agent from Harry's recent romantic past - as the victim may have terrorist ties. Harry, being Harry, resists the Feds every step of the way while continuing his \\"independent\\" investigation.    The Overlook originally ran as a serial in The New York Times and more than occasionally reads that way - some overextended scenes and less than well-defined characters. But it is a Connelly book, so it's better than the average fare out there even though it's a sub-par Bosch book. If you're new to this author/series - don't start here. If you are a Bosch/Connelly fan, your opinion will depend on how much slack you'll provide the author.

B0050XH1H2|4.0|At first listen, The Vaccines may sound like just another weakened strain of many bands you have injured yourself banging your head to before. The Ramones? The Strokes? The Raveonettes if Sharin Foo had a sex change and added a cockney accent? It's all there and more. But don't dismiss The Vaccines as just the latest overhyped British rockers. Listen at least to the first minute and 22 seconds Wreckin' Bar (Ra Ra Ra). Because that's all you get of that one. It's fast. It's fun. It's contagious. So what if all the songs seem to be about wanting to have sex, having sex, breaking up, trying to get back together or having Post Break-Up Sex instead. If you've ever fallen hard for a guitar-driven band, The Vaccines will surely given you a good time in earbud, without exactly making you forget your ex. Then again, what did you expect?
B00501X6YG|5.0|Note: this review applies specifically to the CD and its musical content, I have not seen the DVD.    I was fortunate to receive an advanced copy of Fly from Here the new album by Yes, and it is a masterpiece! The album itself has a timeless quality about it, and is a pleasure to listen to.   Trevor Horn ex-lead singer for Yes is once again with the band as strictly a producer/cowriter, and the product is brilliant.  Note: (Trevor Horn replaced Jon Anderson as lead vocalists in the band for the Drama album exclusively, as well as the tour in support of the album).   This release also marks the debut of Benoît David the new lead singer for Yes, and I have to say I am extremely impressed with his vocals. David appears to sometimes sound a bit like Anderson, but more like Horn, so much so that at times one might think they were listening to something from Drama that was never released. That in fact is not far from the truth, as the title track \\"Fly from Here\\" an epic six part piece is based on a demo from 1980 entitled \\"We Can Fly from Here\\". Having expanded the demo track into the epic it now is was a fantastic idea, and it works mainly due to Benoît David's vocal similarity to Trevor Horn. The other five tracks are primarily stand-alone tunes and are beautifully written and performed by the band as a whole. Rejoining Yes for Fly from Here is yet another member of the band from the Drama album, on keyboards completely outdoing himself is Geoff Downes, and Geoff is at the top of his game, and is refreshing to hear performing at his progressive rock peak. Longtime Yes members Chris Squire , Alan White, and Steve Howe are also in rare form, especially throughout the six part \\"Fly from Here\\".  This album signifies a new beginning for Yes, and brings us some closure from the days of Drama (one of my favorite albums), as well as opening the future for the band building on the Drama sound and taking it to an entirely new level. Fly from Here in many ways is the follow-up to Drama ,that we as Yes fans never got, and although many fans may refuse to accept any other singer then Jon Anderson, get over it! Change can be a good thing, and in the case of Fly from Here an exceptional musical experience!

B004EPYZUI|1.0|The only reason I gave it 1 star is because there wasn't a 0 star. May well be the most stupid movie made in the last 20 years. Don't waste your money. Even if it's given to you, you are waisting hours of your life you will never get back! Go to the dentist and have a root canal, it will be less painful.
044654759X|5.0|Safe Haven is wonderful.  The main character is so loving and brave. Set in one of the most beautiful parts of the U.S. one can almost smell the trees and flora. An absolute delight!
B0055OK2T0|4.0|Definitely worth seeing and a fun ride.    If you really think carefully about the premise on which the movie is based, it's pretty unbelievable and doesn't make a whole lot of sense.     But if you suspend disbelief for the duration of the movie, you'll enjoy a fun and exciting ride..    Matt Damon is very likeable as the main character and Emily Blunt is a really good leading lady. She's quite believable as the object of the Matt character's affections.     Good pace, interesting storyline.
0307887960|5.0|This diet book is phenominal.  The doctor's ideas are great.  I have lost 26 pounds in as many days.  One is never hungry following his plan. Any one that wants to lose would do well getting this fabulous book.
B003UESJH4|3.0|My mother wanted to see this so I bought the DVD and we watched it together...and she enjoyed it (except for the foul language).  I, however, was surprised it got not only Best Picture but also Best Director at the Oscars.  It's really just an everyday \\"Masterpiece Theatre\\" rendition of the story with a lot of \\"F\\" words thrown in.<br /><br />I mean, the story is very inspiring in the best Hollywood fashion.  A flawed man overcomes everything to wind up a great leader of his people during a time of war.  And Colin Firth's embodiment of George VI is remarkable...even more so when you actually can believe he is younger than Guy Peirce, who is seven years Firth's junior and looks even younger than that.  And Helena Bohnam Carter's portrayal of his chirpy, supportive wife is just as excellent...albeit not as flashy.  They both did right by David Seidler's fine script.<br /><br />My main problem stems from Hooper's direction.  It's very pedestrian.  I cannot think of one scene where he added anything more to the flow of the story than just pointing the camera.  Seriously, the man does not know how to form a quiet scene in a dramatic fashion but instead opts for camera set-ups that are disconcerting, at best.  For example, when Lionel and Bertie are talking in the teacher's parlor, they wind up being jammed against frame right or frame left and not looking at each other except in the vaguest of senses.  It's pretty telling that, at a time when I should be engrossed in the story, I'm jolted by things like that.<br /><br />It's not a bad movie.  The performers are all at the top of their game, from Timothy Spall as Churchill to Derek Jacobi as a smarmy Archbishop, and the script is solid enough to make everything come together.  But Best Picture?  Best Director?  Not hardly.
B003L77G06|3.0|Modern Family's first season was pretty good, I'll say. It was sort of fresh, original, funny. Better than a lot of the shows on TV, to say the least.    But the second season wasn't quite as good. It went to the well of Cam-as-stereotypical-overzealous-diva once too many, and while Ed O'Neill and Rico Rodriguez gave very good performances, some parts of the season just fell flat. Certain storylines were cliched, and the show was somewhat overshadowed in my mind by better comedies ('Community', 'Parks and Recreation' and 'Louie' for example). Two episodes that perfectly encapsulate what I feel Modern Family hit a bit of a sophomore slump: \\"Our Children, Ourselves\\" and \\" The Musical Man'.     (Possible spoilers?)   The first had a storyline involving an increasingly convoluted plot involving Mitchell mistaking a little person for a child (which could have been ripped straight from a '50s era sketch comedy) while the second is just really predictable. The jokes fall flat and you can tell exactly what's going to happen. As soon as I saw the ad that Phil was going to put on the side of the truck, I knew that the joke was that it looked like Phil was whoring out his wife, daughter, et al. And it's not that predictability is always bad, but the show didn't feel as fresh or interesting this season.     In short, Modern Family season 2 had a lot of good jokes and plenty of good episodes... but it felt more like a traditional sitcom and less, well, funny.     Grade: 3.5/5
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am not a star wars fan, but I am tired of Lucas leeching as much money as he can and screwing over the fans who made him rich in the first place. It is well known that these blu-rays are not of the highest possible quality, lack original versions of the first films, and have many other issues which are not acceptable for a blu-ray release of the most popular sci-fi fantasy series ever. I just wanted to let people know that the entire film series will be re-released in theaters in 2012 in 3D. So, most likely, the special edition 3D blu-ray box set which will follow those films will be the one to get. Although that may not be til 2013, I dont think people should let lucas get away with releasing another sub-par product.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Great performance by Stevie Nicks and Dave Stewart (producer). Sounds fresh and romantic with Stevie's unique voice and has intriguing lyrics. This album could become my album of the year. Check number 9, it's outstanding. Buy this record. Gr.Ad

0062059882|5.0|There are so many reviews of the old book I won't spend much time doing that here. It is a modern day masterpiece. One that will be remembered for a long time.<br /><br />What I would like to address is which edition you should purchase. If you already own American Gods then there is almost nothing new to be found here. There is just a small amount of new content. You should at least read his introduction to this edition. So if you have never purchased this book before then this is the best looking and most complete version available.<br /><br />Bottom line is don't double dip but if this is your first copy you owe it to yourself to get this edition.
0545157617|4.0|The book has nice illustrations and reads well.  I don't understand why Santa Claus was inserted into the story....I would have preferred to see the witch on the broom take stickman home.
0553381695|4.0|Reviews of sequals are a tricky thing. Once you have read the first one then you will keep reading regardless of what anybody else says until you are tired of it. In a best case scenario is you finish satisfied. So it is with this in mind that I write this review to fans who are interested in what other fans think of the different books in the series.<br /><br />Well written and great moments abound in the sophomore outing for this series. It is good all the way threw. Then the last battle comes and knocks you out of the park. I find major battles in books problematic. Never once did I lose place of what was going on and what was at stake. One of the best chapters in the whole series so far comes toward the end when catelyn stark comes to terms with Jamie. That scene is everything this series strives to do.<br /><br />The complaints I have is it feels a little like stalling. Or maybe it is the strengths of the first and third that makes this entry just a tad quieter.<br /><br />All in all I loved this book and the series is the best being written in the fantasy genre.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Great remake.  It is a very interesting movie.  Very stunning visuals, it draws you in if you used to be into gaming or are into gaming.  It is an amazing grid world.
0670033049|5.0|East of Eden is one of those books that most people want to read once before they die. It will not disappoint.<br /><br />The book is sweeping and not interested in following the conventions of most novels. I for one am very glad to have gotten to know the Trask and Hamiltons.
B004EPYZQM|5.0|I rarely ever do a review on here of anything. Even though I have bought numourous things off of Amazon I rarely ever do a review. But after seeing Fast Five I feel like I need to tell the world how good it is. But if action movies aren't your thing and your more of a Black Swan or Benjamin Button type of person this ain't for you. But if you like good unbeliveable action movies that keep you on the edge of your seat than this is for you. Vin Diesel and crew really out did themselves with this one and one can only imagine what part 6 will be like. Yes the action is unrealistic and would never ever happen in real life without them dying but that's the fun of these movies. You see stuff you wouldn't normally see in real life like two guys driving a car off a cliff into the water. Or someone dragging a safe full of money down the freeway knocking over cars in the process. Or shootouts over roof tops in Rio. Besides the action in this movie I like the characters in this one or character, The Rock. They finally introduce someone how can take on Vin Diesel and make it believable. When Rock is off camara you want him back and when he's back he is on point. Rock should get his own spinoff or something after this and it's nice to see him back in a action movie. Rock and Vin Diesel go at it in their fight scene which I hope there is more of in part 6. The other characters are from the previous movies like Ludacris, Tyrese & others. They are brought back to help Paul Walker and Vin Diesel pull off a heist against a man who tried to have them killed in the beginning. It's nice to see the characters from 2 Fast reunited and even those from Tokyo Drift. There isn't much street racing and I think that was a good choice. I think that it was a good ideal for them to drop the whole street race angle because it was getting played out and refresh the franchise with the whole heist job thing. Although they should have started it with Fast and Furious because that was sort of a letdown.Speaking of Fast and Furious it's ashame they went and killed off Diesel's girl she would have been good in this. Oh yeah watch after the credits to see the set up for part 6 if someone hasn't already told you about it or you' ve already watched it on Youtube.
055357342X|5.0|One was Great and two didn't disappoint. Nothing can prepare you for how truly awesome this book is. Chapter after chapter you keep thinking this pace cannot last. Sure enough the next chapter is better than the last.<br /><br />I will keep this spoiler free but suffice to say there are some huge story movements meaning that not all of our characters will make it out alive.<br /><br />Lets address the best thing in this book. Tyrion Lannister is so outstanding in this entry. His story in this one alone is worth the money and time you will spend with this book. The last chapter in his POV will haunt your thoughts for a long time.<br /><br />I can honestly not think of a complaint. It all works so well. This is a master at the top of his game.

B004WESFZW|4.0|It is a science fiction romance movie. What this means is that the guy is entertained with the ideas and the imagery. The Girl loves the two people who are falling in love. If your like my wife and I then you will care about both together. Girls give it a shot even though it is sci-fi. You will love it. Guys watch it even though it is a romance movie. Then when it is done talk to each other about what you thought. When both are happy I find good things (wink wink) happen!

Because I have this collection as well I thought maybe my son had mixed them up. But after checking I found that wasn't the case and that I had been shipped a case with two dvd's from Stargate Sg-1.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Well, another Sci Fi \\"depth\\" type of saga cancelled - apparently people are only interested in shallow \\"camp\\" stuff where the good guys wear the white hats and the bad guys wear the black hats!
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Advent Children Complete is definitely a good investment for hard-core Final-Fantasy VII fans.  For those who have seen the original Advent Children and enjoyed it, Advent Children Complete takes the story to a whole new level.  There is nearly a half hour of new footage, delving farther into everyone's lives and pasts.  In addition, the graphics are superb! If you like to see the characters actually get injured when they're stabbed with swords, Advent Children Complete is the way to go.  Cloud gets visible wounds when Sephiroth attacks him and all the characters show dirt and mud as they fight each other.  Good movie.  Worth my money.
B0000A98ZP|4.0|This movie arrived quick. Which is always a good thing. I hate when it takes forever for a movie or purchase to get to my mail box. When I bought it used I was afraid that it would come with scratches and would skip certain scenes, so I would have appreciated it if I had known if it was going to have several scratches. Other than that it has been a very good purchase and I am pleased with the product.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I devoured Phillipa Gregory's \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and was excited to then watch the movie.    I was so very disappointed.    The movie is basically only about the fact that Henry needs an heir.    It barely touches on the great measures he takes to gain one. (Forcing his current wife into exile til he can marry Anne, claiming his first marriage was invalid, his separation from Rome and the Pope, setting forth new laws to suit his own needs, the Oath of Succession (after Elizabeth is born) and the fact that Henry put to death anyone who refused (even his good friends)).   None of that was really touched on in the movie at all. The separation from Rome was merely mentioned in passing.    It hardly touched on how tortured and desparate Anne is to give Henry a son.  The bitter rivalry between Mary and Anne is hardly felt at all.   And the time just flies. Anne managed to keep Henry's eyes on just her for many years, but in this movie it seems as if just days had passed. There is no showing of time passed.    Lots of other interesting stuff was left out of the movie, making it very dull to me.   To mention a few: ****BOOK SPOILERS!*****  The fact that Mary bore Henry two children before he moved onto Anne.  The \\"monster\\" baby that was born to Anne after she supposedly slept with her brother to conceive a son (which she was sure Henry could not.), which then led to her downfall, trial, and then death.  Anne being so desperate, and unfeeling towards Mary, that she adopts Mary's son out from under her.  Mary finding true love with William Stafford and the drama that that relationship caused.  George's hidden homosexual love life.  How the Howards and Boleyns treated Mary and Anne as if they were nothing more than pawns, and had no cares about their wishes or feelings.  Henry moving onto Jane Seymore when Anne was so desperately trying to hold onto him and give him a son.  I could go on forever.....    Bottome line, the good stuff in the story was all removed for this movie and we were left only the most basic of details.    No feeling, no emotion, no richness, etc.  Everything was just so glossed over.    I would not recommend this movie.  Book or no book.  It's just not a very interesting/good movie.
B0057UVLQ0|2.0|I love Selena, I really do. But this isnt her, I'm sorry. None of the songs sound like her, except Outlaw. I expected a better album. I'm sorry she's giving into the peer pressure of the world.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Totally loved it! I love Tina's sense of humor and her way of telling old stories.<br />If you really need some cheer up or just want to laugh out loud, go on and read this book.<br />She did a great job, totally flawless!
B00364K6J2|4.0|Originally I rented this DVD.  Excellent single frame animation with an interesting plot.  This is a great family movie.  My kids liked it so much that I bought it from Amazon.  Classified as animation, I'd up my rating to 5 stars.  George Clooney does a great job with the character.
B001KQZ7I8|4.0|It was a really interesting book since it relates the holocaust from another point of view.. living inside the camp ... Just like Diary of a Young Girl, one can learn a lot about that time and the horror Jewish people went through. Really touching.. too much suffering... Definitely Mr Frankl is a resilient!
B004OEIL54|4.0|Just when u thought the slasher genre was wrung dry and all screamed out, Wes Craven returned to revive the genre he helped to create! Armed with a tongue-in-cheek attitude, a tight screenplay and a new cast (for 1996), Scream stood out as an original that year. This Blu ray transfer has excellent video. Audio transfer could have been better. Not as good as one would expect from a genre defining movie as this. Ditto for the extras. Would have liked more by way of back stories on the creation and cast interviews. But I love the movie and I'm glad I own the hi def version of this movie to keep!
1594744769|5.0|I had some preconceived notions on what \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" was going to be about.  Most of them were wrong - but that's totally okay.  This was definitely a DIFFERENT type of book - from the storyline to the inserted \\"peculiar\\" pictures.  It was a fun book to read, with adventure, monsters, unusual talents, romance, danger.<br /><br />The characters could have been developed a little more - and maybe that will happen in the next \\"peculiar\\" book since this one ends in a direction that definitely calls for at least one sequel.  I thought the first part of the book did a better job of this (before the island).<br /><br />The pictures were a huge part of my enjoyment of the book.  They fit in so well with the story.  It brings to mind the chicken and the egg.  Which came first - pictures or story?<br /><br />The book is beautifully made, from dustcover to pictures to endpapers to high quality of paper used.  The book is actually bound, too, not glued.  It is a beautiful book for anyone's collection.  The book isn't in full color.  It is meant to look dated, using black and white photos.  But there are different shades of beiges and browns also used in the book besides black and white and the color combinations work well together.<br /><br />I would recommend this for age 12 years and up.  I think a lot of adults will enjoy it as much as I did.  I think younger children might be scared of some of the situations.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|these headphones sound really good for there price, but really shine after re-cabling them and putting a couple of filters on them. sound even better through a good cmoy amp. akg velour pads like mentioned in an above review make them alot more comfortable. link to the tweak forum for these over at rock grotto is [...] give them a listen and a upgrade if you are skilled enough, once upgraded and burned in, you wont be disappointed.
0812550706|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Despite the main character being a child genius, I was able to relate. It built well and kept my attention, and despite how long it's been around, I was have kept myself on purpose in a shadow about this book because I wanted to read it for myself. It has a fun twist ending.
B004CMB1UA|5.0|I have found Johnny Depp's reading of this book absolutely entertaining.  A fascinating autobiography of a fascinating man.  One of my favorite purchases this year.  Treat yourself.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|This is one of those movies that you watch and it stays in your head...for far too long! I am kind of at a loss for words but will try to do a \\"review\\".     I didn't even remember hearing about this film. I don't know if it came out in the movies or on DVD but it should've never been created. I'll tell you that. They wasted millions on garbage. I caught it on Comcast On Demand so at least I didn't pay for it.    This movie is so bad it doesn't deserve a review but I'll give it a try. There is nothing good about this movie. Even the special effects sucked. The plot was nothing new and the entire film was a waste of time. Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley are scientists (yeah right) who \\"splice\\" together human DNA with a bunch of other stuff and creates this alien/human girl, snot-looking thing they name Dren. They keep her in the lab until she gets too big and noisy then move her to a secluded ranch in the middle of nowhere. By this time you've either turned off this movie or have fallen asleep. Unlucky for me I managed to stay awake through the entire thing and I will regret it for the rest of my life.    I don't know what the hell the producers, writer or director was thinking of. You can't even classify this film. At first it starts off looking like it would be Alien, with Dren going crazy and killing people. That doesn't happen. It suddenly switches into PBS Family Hour when they get to the farm. Sarah Polley has become obsessed with the creature and thinks it's her daughter. If that's not disgusting enough, Adrian Brody is lusting after the alien and we soon go from PBS Family Hour to alien porn! Yes, that's what you get from this film, a lot of bad writing, sickening scenes and alien pornography as if the film wasn't sleazy enough as it is.    Adrian Brody has sex with Dren and Dren (who has the ability to change from female to male) changes into a male and rapes Sarah Polley in the woods. Yes, that's right. We get alien sex from Adrian Brody and an alien rape in just a few scenes afterward. I almost threw up everything I ate.    Sigh. What can I say? Unless you don't have long to live and you don't give a hoot what you watch, hey what the heck? Might as well watch this. But if you got a life to live and one you enjoy, run from this like the plague. There is nothing good about this movie at all. I actually love Adrian Brody but after seeing him in this, not so sure. This is further proof that Brody's been hit by the Oscar Winner curse. He hasn't done anything beyond B-movie status since he won Best Actor and it's such a waste.    But hey, at least Dren was pretty. She was actually the best-looking one in the film. Neither Brody or Polley are beauties by all-means but they looked especially retched in this. Polley looked like a ghost and Brody like a phantom. Maybe this horrid movie affected their looks.    Skip this and save yourself for the good of mankind. If you choose to watch it, just remember that you've been warned.
1932100385|5.0|Having lived for a ton of years, how did I miss knowing how many diseases are touched off by foods!      The China Study may be the most important book I've ever read-at least, for my constitution, it certainly has proved to be just that.    The damage animal proteins cause was news to me; how fortunate I was to discover this highly interesting study and then to be able to take advantage of the results of that study.    Read it! It's a most important book.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is ofically my favorite book. I've read it three times in two days. I can't put my finger on why i've fallen in love with this book.. Maybe it's because of how protective Travis is, or because i just plain am in love with there relationship.. I can only hope when i fall in love, i find a guy that's half as caring at Travis.(:
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I don't know what I expected from this book. I know that I devoured it. I could not put it down. It is a great love story with laughter and tears alike. I plan to read it again and again. From the beginning to the end, you'll be so entranced. I highly recommend this if you enjoy contemporary romances.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Spoiler alert!!!!!      Beautiful Disaster immediately grabbed my attention starting the scene at a human cock fight it is a great attention grabber!  Most Romances start out as a I love you and immediately do the cheesy one-liners. Not \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" It starts out slow and works to that point. I will admit that Travis has major issues that in real life any girl would immediatly have red flags which makes me a little confused as to why the author would let Abbey put up with that behaviour, she doesn't discourage it all that much.  Another thing that bugged me was how a person, even in marriage can not \\"belong\\" to someone no one is ever a property, people have rights!!!!!! Traviss' attitude about being owned and his major jealousy issues ticked me off.   Overal a great story, absolutely loved it recommend to anyone who loves romance but hates cheesy harlequin novels!
B0018QOIXU|4.0|Actually, I bought Adele's second album, \\"21\\", first. This is not a as good as 21, but if you like Adele's singing style as much as I, you'll enjoy this ablum also.
0316098329|5.0|This book takes an amazing story and makes it very real. While it was at first hard to read as the language was that of a child's, it added so much to the story to have it told by the little boy. Wonderful characters and interesting observations on our world through perspective of a fresh, young set of eyes.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|great movie.. i had watched the extended cut before the theatrical release and i was very pleased with both versions of the film. the extended cut was much better though. the movie had me and my girlfriend on the edge of our seats and trying to figure out what was going on. i was not expecting the ending at all! Zack snyder pulled no punches and then sucker punched ya.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Frustrated that it's taking so long to get the new levels. Love the graphics, and the new birds are cool. Overall awesome app

B000UD0ESA|5.0|Normally, I would post this as feedback for the sellers; however, this is a larger issue than that.  I ordered this from two different companies and both copies had a deep, two-inch long gash in the case.  It was the same size and at the same location for both copies (I had not yet returned the first one when the replacement I ordered arrived today).  In each case, the gash was covered up by a label - laid right across the gash to conceal it - at least most of it.  I write this here because it may be a supplier issue rather than a seller issue since the same defect was covered up the same way with the same type label when ordered from two distinct companies - at least the company names are distinct.<br /><br />I did not open the cases to inspect the damage to the DVDs because I wanted to return the DVDs unopened so they could see the damage.<br /><br />If you order this awesome movie from an Amazon Marketplace business, check under the labels before opening the DVD - it is very noticeable.<br /><br />Jim<br /><br />PS - I gave the movie a 5-star rating because it deserves it - I can't see taking away stars for what is being sold cheaply probably because of known, but undivulged to us customers, damage to the packaging by several Amazon Marketplace companies.
B00354Y9ZU|4.0|The book's probably a little longer than it needs to be, but still the content is awesome. Seth Godin uses his usual delivery method to make a point about doing \\"the work\\" (which is not necessarily your \\"job\\").<br /><br />The book is about being indispensable and what it takes from you to be indispensable. The stories in it are inspiring and Godin's way of explaining things so that you can move beyond just working to becoming a linchpin is direct and very much to the point. There's no room for confusion.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|I'll start off with things I didn't like about this movie. The whole \\"aliens invade earth\\" deal has been done so many times over that it's getting way old. They also took a bunch of lines from Independence Day at the end of the movie. They also had way too many cliche' lines when combat actually took place. Oh, and Michelle Rodriguez. Jeez lady, stop taking the same type-cast role in every other movie.     As for the thing that I really liked: character development. These kinds of movies rarely ever incorporate the human element in the forces that are sacrificing everything to turn back an alien invasion. The interactions between Marines in the beginning of the movie felt real and genuine. As someone who's been in the military and deployed in-theater overseas, I found myself thinking, \\"Yea, they'd say that\\" or, \\"yea they'd do that.\\" When one of the Marines got killed, you actually felt something for them. Combine it with watching to movie on Blu-ray and suddenly the experience becomes even more intense. Props to the military advisors on the movements and some added realism that wouldn't otherwise be there.     Cut down on the cheese lines, and develop the characters a little more, and who knows, you could have a better sequel.
1423101499|5.0|I love this book! Racheal really drove me crazy, always coming in when Percy and Annabeth were together, but she had to so that the suspence built between them. I didn't care for Nico's powers, but when you're the son of Hades, I guess there's nothing you can do about it. I was so happy to find that Nico changed his mind and ended up trying to help Percy and everyone. I was really happy that his mom had found someone, and hoped that they'd end up together through the whole thing. I don't care for Athena that much, but she has a point. I was glad to see that Tyson was in it, it was only right, and that Percy really cared about him. It was really weird when Luke became Kronos, that only made me want Luke that much more. A wonderful book in all and highly recommend it to others. I can't wait to get the next one!
B001HN6922|5.0|My Grand-daughter and I were breathless through many of the Cars 2 scenes.  We were lucky to see the action in 3D Imax.  The spy characterizations wrapped around unsuspecting, naive and wonderful Mater in a masterful way.  Of course the stylized Pixar humor, effects and fabulous art/design met and exceeded this movie-goer's expectations, with the excitement of the workings of a huge oil platform, and a whirlwind tour around the world... just right for exposing youngsters to well-know global landmarks!   I need to see this movie again and again just to spot all the items impossible to catch the first or 2nd time, no matter how one tries to see & hear everything.  I rate this one of the best action animated films, equally with the humor one looks forward to in a Cars film.
0240815807|5.0|I do home recording, rather than running a small studio. It's not entirely clear where the dividing line is, but certainly there was a lot of information in this book that straddled that line. For those doing home recording, there are some sections that you'll read and say, \\"yeah, it would be nice if I had that space and money to do that, but not gonna happen.\\" But there are other parts that will definitely apply and help you out in setting up your mixing space and getting some good mixes. I'm glad I read it and picked up enough helpful tips to make it worth the time.
B004X4R49Y|3.0|This is an artfully crafted feel good movie. Its creators expect the audience to sympathize with the innocent plight of King and be simultaneously dazzled by the glamor of monarchy. Since it is so well crafted it does in fact largely succeed in elicting sympathy for George VI - especially if you don't contemplate the message too carefully.<br /><br />Stammering is a symtom of brain damage. Albert's younger brother is mentioned in the film. It is explained that he died of epilepsy. Epilepsy is also a symtom of brain damge. Seems like a strange cooincidence - what?<br /><br />There have been a number of movies in the last few years focusing on the British Royal Family. Helen Mirren played Elizabeth. Emily Blount a year earlier played Victoria. There have also been two big budget Jack the Ripper movies that featured Victoria's son the Duke of Clarence as Jack. In \\"From Hell\\" the detective is Johnny Depp. In \\"Murder by Decree\\" Chistopher Plummer plays Sherlock Holmes. There was another six part TV series also linking the Royal Family to the Ripper murders. It seems that everyone is willing to believe the absolute worst about the descendents of Victoria and Albert.<br /><br />Victoria and Albert were cousins - first cousins. One of their sons was called The Uncle of Europe because he was related to so many other royals all over Europe. Much the same thing had happened to the Hapsburgs - too much inbreeding which resulted in a lot of genetic defectives on the throne.<br /><br />George VI's stammering looks suspiciously like a disease of consanguinity. Hillbillies in the Ozarks get bad teeth from having too many close relatives in their bloodlines. The royals seem to get brain damage.
1597801585|2.0|The author paints a gorgeous world but needs help with character and plot development. He says in the preface that he wanted to write a story set in the world he experienced when he went to Asia. Well, he made it, but it was obviously forced. Characters are hollow, and it takes at least half the book to find a discernible plot.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|The creativity of Eric Kripke and the performances of Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. The best combination. This is awesome!!
1423101502|5.0|I am so happy with this book! It was fun and kept me glued to its pages. Finally, after four years, you find out what this great prophecy is. I was SO excited to read it, but it wasn't as big of a deal as they made it seem. So much happens that it's almost hard to know where to start. First, I was happy for Percy's mom, she SO deserved to be married to that man. Second, Nico had a big role to play, for which I was happy for him. Annabeth FINALLY got over Luke, it's about time! I was mad at Nico in one chapter, but in the next, I loved him again. I thought it really funny when Percy sat on his dad's thrown and Poseidon freaked out. I couldn't wait for Luke/Kronos to get it, but I didn't care for how he got it. It left me with a question- what happened to Kronos?- but then I found out that Riordan's 'Lost Hero' book is part of Percy's series, so I get it now. It was a wonderful ending to one of the best series I've read. I noticed that Percy didn't change. He grew and stuff, but he never really changed. He didn't get a big head or thought he was intitled to things. He was still the same Percy Jackson as he was in book one, he was only smarter and could fight better. I was really happy that he and Annabeth started to date, or what I call dating. You know how you read a really good book from a series and you have to get the next one to find out what happens? Then, you get the next one and the next one and you finally get to the last one and it's a complete bust because they came up with a quick ending and still left you with questions? Well, this one was nothing like that. Except for the fate of Kronos, all my questions were answered and I feel good about it. Now, I have to get 'The Lost Hero' and see what happens.
0060919760|5.0|Best book ever! :) I can totally relate to this book when I have bad, negative thoughts. It really helps me. It makes me think more than ever and that's something that I do a lot. But now it's much better because all of those thoughts are now positive! :)
B002QGUFWE|4.0|I like this album but find myself skipping over some of the tracks, and also have found that I listen to the Born this way album more and in it's entirety.
B004EPYZUI|2.0|Ok so i don't review allot of movies but i do try to watch my far share. Me and some friends where watching this movie and kind of looking at each other when it finished like what was the meaning of all that. I have to say it was to me a life is a bitch ending. I did read that the director had done 300 and watchmen so this was his artistry movie but to spend so much on over the top special effects dream sequences just didnt seem to stick enough substance in to the film to justify all taking place in her head. I have to admit as a guy in his twenty yes the women where attractive but was that a enough to drive the movie i dont think. I would say u have a hour or two to kill go ahead but dont choose this as your weekend movie night flick. Hope he does better with superman reboot hes directing next.
B0057UVLQ0|5.0|I've loved Selena from the start, and being 18 I really feel like Ive grown up with her. I liked all her albums but I just L O V E this one. Its just a feel good album and her abilities as an artist have improved so much. Def her best thus far. Keep it up Selena (:
0316056863|5.0|I'm going through a divorce and I just want to kill everybody. So I ordered Bossypants to wean me off Sylvia Plath, and it made me so happy. Happy! For the first time in months I laughed - and not that maniacal something-awful-just-happened laugh, either. Whew. So I can honestly say (with more conviction than when Madonna said Sandra Bernhardt's book saved her life), that this book saved my life.   Tina Fey writes like she'd die if she didn't. Sitting cross-legged and putting her hair up in curlers, she tells you everything. She'll even draw you a picture. Her segues are astonishing, and she is clearly the funniest person you know.  So, if you are besieged by anything, read this book and the world will suddenly make sense. Or even if it doesn't, you will still be limp with laughter and totally unsuited to a crime of passion. It's a win/win.

0345363132|3.0|This was my second Penman novel, after There Be Dragons. Penman is accurate on dates and places, and can build up scenes and characters. However, the ideals of the book are so anachronistic, the sensibilities, be they in war, marriage or child rearing, so unmedieval, so post-1970s American, that both the books feel like they were written by a soccer mom who has nothing but the deepest sorrow for the people she is writing about. That work if Penman had a shred of humor, of irony, of anything other than the pathetically earnest \\"BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN!\\" hand wringing as the general tenor of her writing.    I'd suggest CJ Sansom, Dorothy Dunnett (Lymond Chronicles), Patricia Finney (Becket/Ames series), Steven Saylor (Roma Sub Rosa series), if you're into historical fiction. There is a humor, strangeness, over-the-top craziness in the writing of those novelists that are completely absent in Penman.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|I just finished watching this movie so its fresh in my head. I have to say i have been a Bradly cooper fan from wedding c rashers.  This is the kind of movie allot of us can relate to a guy going from having nothing to alot of something. I am not a big drug user fan i like the concept. I think that some one that smart would have not done some of the things that he had but hey that's a movie and it leaves u with a what if ending so i would say def a good guy flick your girl friend might be hitting u on the arm asking whats going on every fiv mins lol
B000063DFN|5.0|extremely good album from beginning to end ,great guitar bass drums and vocals,one of the best albums ever as far as metal! to the three jokers who left 1 star ratings,youre obviously posers and need t5o get back to your milk and cookies,while i have a beer! 30 plus years and still going strong,maiden is here to stay, if you like the lame bands mentioned by the moron who gave this 1 star then you probably dont deserve to bask in iron maidens glory! i would love to get thiose 3 guys in a mosh pit they wouldnt stand a chance!
1400052181|5.0|Another unforgetable read. So interesting. Most of us would not be here today, only for the scientific use of this woman's cells. God Bless her.
B004A8ZX2S|5.0|this is a movie out side the box.Leave your preconceived ideas of what a movie is and should be and has been outside the door before you go in.Then leave your thoughts there as well.Then go and sit down and let the music and images play while you absorb them.Once is probably not enough.Again and again preferably on a big screen and one will begin forming coherent themes and ideas.There are many of those in this movie and they are what you want or make them to be,a sort of Rorschach blotter to each person.So go in not expecting anything and see what the movie does to you or where it takes you...its up to you!

B002EEP3NO|5.0|Littiraly, this is the most expensive yet funnest lego i have ever bought! I remember earlier, like years ago the biggest lego I ever got was the eiffel tower, and that was fun to build, but yet it had less play value than the death star. The death star has so many features, you can play with it forever. I found the emperor the coolest minifigure, especally when he has the lightning pieces on his hands. though, the set is very breakable, and if it rolls over, it is likley to fall apart. one time my death star fell off of a table and fell apart into a gzillion pieces. Friggin anoying and heck of difficult to put back together. Anyways, this is a great lego, get it if you can!
B003VBGAR2|5.0|mind blowing album,every song is tight and well written and played my favorite is orion it reminds me of meeting cliff burton when i was 14 they opened for ozzy and blew him off the stage,this is definitely one of the best speed metal albums ever made, its sad that metallica sold their souls to lame boring music, if cliff wouldnt have died i truly believe they would still be amazing!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|How do people give this such low scores?  This is a great series.  Those that say it's gotten to bogged down don't understand this book has something for the everyday reader as well as the hardcore fans who want a well documented ongoing history.  Thanks George.
B003F3NDP8|5.0|Ordered the entire series and have enjoyed every episode....Very talented cast and fun storylines.  You really get to know everybody almost as if you live on Wisteria Lane with them.  It's great to not have to bother with commercials too....Highly recommended.  Each season has plenty of episodes to keep you entertained for quite some time.....
B004AQPPNM|3.0|Personally, I felt like this record is not at all up to par with the rest of their work. \\"Treason\\" was stock metalcore, \\"Hearts\\" was amazing, then \\"Homesick\\" was a nice blend of the two. But \\"Separates\\" has only three really heavy songs, and there is no combination or blend of heavy with the pop melodies that ADTR is known for. Check out \\"All I Want\\", \\"2nd Sucks\\" and \\"Better Off This Way\\"
B0041R35W8|1.0|I purchased the audio cd and the review is based only on the cd.   The big problem with it is the narration.  So much of the success of audiobooks is based on the reader.  A good reader can turn a book into a fantastic listening experience.  A bad reader can make it unlistenable.  The problem with this narrator is that while he is highly articulate and perfectly enunciates each word, I felt there was no heart in it.  The octave of his voice never got above or below a certain point.  After a while I felt like I was listening to a robot, and I wasn't able to even complete the first disc.  The best readers don't just read, but they really experience the story and become the characters.  All that was missing here.      My recommendation, buy the book.  If you prefer audiobooks, avoid this one.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|While I am not the biggest Beyonce fan, (only other CD of her's I own is Dangerously in Love)this CD is hot!  The music is nice and a lot of the lyrics shows that she has grown as a person.  My favs are 1+1, Best Thing I Never Had, Love On Top and Rather Die Young.  Get this album, you will see yourself in some of the lyrics!
B002ZG980U|4.0|Inception is the type of movie that asks a lot right out of the gate. It's a bit like having a friend who owes you a ton of money promising to pay the debt with golden turds his dog started dropping after he switched puppy-chow brands. The natural temptation to respond by slapping him in his lying face is pushed aside when he presses that first, shiny, golden butt-burrito into your hands before he runs off to feed his dog again. I'm sure I could have picked a better analogy, but that one is quite accurate, and it also lets me use funny euphemisms like \\"butt-burrito\\".<br /><br />With Inception, just as with the magical \\"Golden\\" dog, if you stop to think about it long enough you soon realize that, not only does the story not make any sense, but you've been given a finely polished deuce in place of actual money. And it takes a lot of polishing to keep you slack-jawed and incapable of incredulity for the 2.5 hour run-time of this film. The fact that they pull it off is actually quite impressive, although having a boat-load of money certainly made it easier for them. I'm no expert and more importantly, I'm too lazy to look it up, but I'm going to go ahead and claim that the studio budget for this movie rivals the GDP of many small island nations. A-list actors, impressive sets, complex action sequences...all are tossed about with the carefree air of a Saudi Sheik who just discovered his oil fields are sitting atop vast deposits of pure heroin.<br /><br />Of course, all the spectacular scenery is meant to keep your eyes on the magician while his lovely assistant drops your trousers and rifles around in your body cavities. Inception is just a trick - smoke and mirrors and the occasional albino tiger wrapped in layer after layer of misdirection and executed with practiced slight-of-hand. The central plot is about as thin as soviet soup - Leo and his team of \\"extractors\\" specialize in dream burglary, essentially hijacking their mark's subconscious to get him/her to divulge industrial secrets, PIN numbers, their grandma's secret velvet cake recipe...whatever. How this is done is glossed over entirely - everyone hooks themselves up to a silver briefcase and it just works, ok? Now stop asking silly questions and relax your colon, because we're just getting started.<br /><br />See, Inception is not just another dream movie. Apparently, a single dream world where anything is possible was simply too limiting, and to break out of the straightjacket of infinite possibilities you need to go into a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream.....you get the idea. The only thing necessary to pull this off is another silver briefcase for each successive dream, an easy matter given that you can essentially drop whatever you want to into these dreams. You've just been handed the golden, impossible deuce: the mechanics of this concept are never adequately explained yet the consequences of traveling through multiple dream \\"levels\\" are central to the story.<br /><br />That's not to say it's a bad movie. Oh, I'm sorry...did the previous paragraphs deceive you into thinking this movie was a big pile of suck? Well, it depends on whether or not you decide to take the golden deuce to the bank or not. If you're willing to accept that gold is gold then it does not matter what shape it's in or even what orifice it was excreted from. You deposit the deposit (snicker) and go about your business. You can do the same thing with Inception: take the story at face value and ignore that little part of you that scoffs in disbelief and you'll have no problem enjoying this film. If you can't help but see through the smoke and mirrors it will only become more ridiculous with each passing minute.<br /><br />I recommend you give this movie a shot, mainly because it is a massively ambitious story to tell in this format and, despite its short comings, manages to be riveting and original. The third act is a masterful display of tight pacing, tying together multiple timelines with fluid precision while never letting up the suspense. I found myself unable to stop watching, even when the ending became more or less predictable, and I respect the ambition of the story enough to jettison my complaints about its execution. I don't think it will ever become the instant classic, genre-inventing film that it was hyped up to be, but it explores interesting territory (albeit superficially), and makes for an excellent viewing experience. Given what hollywood serves up as typical fare these days I'd say a golden deuce is about the best you can hope for.on while never letting up the suspense.

B003F3NDOE|5.0|Ordered the entire series and watched it from the beginning to the end....Had Ugly Betty Day marathons....Loved it!  Great cast and great storylines....Highly recommended...
B004H6G0TI|1.0|just purchased this game but it will not start on my eeepad.  when opening it gives me an error screen saying that it must shut down.  only gave it 1 star because ihave it on my palm pre and i now how fun it is.  i hope this gets fixed.
0553805371|2.0|The book looks great but the audio book was extremely dull.  The narrator was the problem. Although he was highly articulate and enunciated perfectly (as many British do) I felt he was just reading the words and not conveying the story.  After a while I felt like I was listening to a robot.  I never made it past the first disc.
030746363X|3.0|There is a lot of odd stuff in here. I got some good ideas but much of the book is junk that most people would never use and some of it appeared to be outright dangerous.
B000050HTO|5.0|Great CD with all the Dylan hit's you will ever need. Price was right with all the great songs that were included.
0345505387|3.0|The illustrations are great; helped me form mental  images of Jaime & Claire. Not how I envisioned them. It was a fast read, but I I expected more of a prequel.  I also had a hard time differentiating between the male characters; they all look alike.
0307279189|4.0|I brought this book because I heard it springboarded the Vibram Five-Finger shoe movement.  One thing I want to point out is that this book is not about Vibram Five-Finger shoes, rather its truly just about running and our relation to it.   Never purchased a book completely devoted to running either so as a runner myself, my interest was further sparked.  As I started reading, already within the first few pages of the book, thought-provoking statistics and info was laid out that really made me pause to think.  This phenomenon continued all through the book.  One thing I really liked about the book was that it had a very colorful cast of real characters that called for even more colorful situations and interactions amongst themselves.  This book is not just a monologue about scientific data and blah blah blah.  It actually has a (loosly?) true story line.      About a quarter of the way from the end of the book, I made up my mind to return my 150-dollar Asics GT-2160 running shoes that I purchased barely a month before to get the Vibram Five-Finger Bikilas.  Haven't gotten the Bikilas yet but I have been barefoot running and love it.  It would of been a tragedy to finish reading this book and end up stuck with those Asics wishing that I found out about this sooner.  That's how riveting and thought-provoking the information in this book is.  It will rock completely what you thought you knew about running.    The only reason why I didn't give this book 5 stars was because it got a little heavy on the evolution (yuck) at some points, some rough adult humor, and a little profanity.  Profanity does not turn me on.  Ignore those things and this book is amaaazing.  So in other words, this is mainly a book for grown-ups, not children; although the information in it can benefit everyone.  I would still recommend it to my mature family and friends who I think would truly enjoy and benefit from this book.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Loved it!  This book has made me a fan and I can't wait for the next book to this trilogy.  it had a bit of everything and the pace is nice not too fast or too slow and the characters are beautifully written giving them depth.  Brilliant!
0525423273|3.0|This is a really sweet YA romance, but unfortunately VERY predictable. Girl meets cute boy. They like each other, but she sort-of has a boyfriend, and he has a girlfriend. They become friends, but are constantly crushing on each other. Lots of misunderstandings and fights, then they make up 'as friends'... lather rinse repeat. Repeat. Repeat again. By about 3/4 through I was getting really tired of the fight-then-make-up plot. I kept hoping for something unexpected to happen but it was all SO expected! The saving grace was that the characters are very likeable. Still, I'm surprised that a story with such a predictable plot has become such a hit. There are way fresher, more original YA romances out there! Also, to me this read like the author had never been to Paris; the descriptions were kind of flat, they didn't evoke much of the magic of that city for me at all. If you're looking for YA romances that are sweet but ORIGINAL, try Brad Barkley or Heather Hepler.
0439023521|5.0|I'd been seeing this book recommended everywhere.  I read the synopsis and I was hooked, I had to read it.  It was a great book!  The only negative thing I could say about it is that it was written and marketed as a young adult book, but I worry that the subject matter is a little too violent for the younger of the young adults.  Teenagers forced to kill each other for other's amusement isn't the greatest storyline for children to read.    I loved everything else about this book.  It's one of those page-turners that won't let you put it down until you've read it all.  Katniss has had to take on the responsibility of taking care of her mother and little sister since her father was killed in the mines.  She's 16, but already an adult.  Living such a harsh life has forced her to bottle up her emotions, so she finds being partnered with Peeta especially difficult. She slowly learns to open up and evolve through the trials in the story.    It's a great story that leaves you wanting more.
0880794968|1.0|I simply dont like this deck or its interpretations. I felt nothing spiritually and using them felt like trying to put a 500 piece puzzle together with 102 pieces available. The only thing that is clear to me about this set is that they are hideous and incapable of visiually stimulating natural intuition.
B004Z7AHZC|4.0|This was a good movie and both the kids and I stayed interested. However unlike the books Roderick actually warms up to Greg. This sentimentality is not featured in the book series and may reflect a Hollywood desire for some niceness. It turned me off a bit but it's still a good movie with some funny lines. I kind of miss the mean Roderick though.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I read the first few chapters of this book for free online and eagerly anticipated being able to purchase it and read the rest.  Although the chapters built curiosity and anticipation to a fevered pitch, the end left me feeling very let down.  I agree with other reviewers who state that after all the hype for this book and what I consider a rather high price for an ebook, it wasn't worth paying full price.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I couldn't believe that I would love this story so much, but I did.  I mean, I'm a dog person, but not a car person or a racing person, but the book was so engaging, I really couldn't stop reading.  It's great!!!
B004EQAVHI|4.0|Ishiguru in his works wonders what it would be like looking back on our life.You don't get a 2nd chance and often it's too late.This film seems a metaphor for the fragility of our lives,the importance of love,the people are not realistic 3-D, they exist in a parenthesis of traits like self-denial,emotional repression, appropriateness and duty,what they've built their lives on.The tragic constraint of a medical discovery in 1952 has prolonged people's lives to 100 at the cost of an army of secret donors.The medical police state is so entrenched,so invisibly embedded in this provincial fantasy England that people become immune,areaccepting of their fate.Hailsham is a boarding school of pupils who feel privileged and special,encouraged to do art,games and keep themselves physically healthy. Yet despite the care lavished on them, their world has a puzzlingly second-hand feel. It is only when they are 11 years old that the boarding school children accidentally learn the sinister truth about who they are, why they are there, and what awful plans the state has in store for them.Three of the pupils form a love triangle,Kathy H (Mulligan), Tommy(Garfield),and Ruth (Knightley)Mulligan and Garfield are especially moving in their roles.A rage beneath the surface calm.     They are in effect clones whose lives are about donating a supply of their organs at a date determined by somebody else's schedule.By age 18 they move onto the `cottages' in the country,they have a certain measure of freedom,they can drive about,but their lives are still circumscribed by wrist tags.This gentle, subtle film has sinister undertones.These clones are sympathetic,teeming with the hormones, anxieties,doubts of `normal'children,whose lives are shortened to early middle age. We take the clones' perspective,especially Kathy's,the narrator, who becomes a `carer',in the banal public sector phrasing,who calls the people she cares for `donors', where we move to in the films 3rd sector.Kathy herself will become a donor eventually.Kathy's sense of fate was heightened by losing Tommy,who she really loves, to Ruth who seized him under Kathy's nose.They all drift apart and meet years later,when Ruth and Tommy separately have made their 2nd donations and Kathy meets them as a carer.She realizes she still loves Tommy and discovering he's done art works they try for a `deferral' of their fates,to tap a rumour going round.There is a sense of bleak beauty about the cinematography,the film is directed by Romanek with great poignancy,with fitting music by Rachel Portman.Not SF but an alternate reality about our lives never having been what they could have been,missed opportunities, and the inevitability of our death.
B001L51RQE|3.0|The Police are a great band. Just not as great as they were. If your looking to this as what's heard on the cd's, forget it. Some songs still sounded good but some were killed in some forced remakes. Wrapped Around Your Finger is a standout let down for me. Sounds nothing like the actual song, but instead a slow rythmic droning annoyance. Copeland plays great throughout. Andy Summers is good but somewhat hard to hear clearly. Sting is fantastic on bass, but awful singing. Not that he doesn't hit the notes but that every song as Sting moaning and ooooing way too often. In fact his over doing it made me skip songs. Pretty cheap and not too good. Unless you want to add concert dvd's to build a collection (like me) or are a die hard Police fan i'd would skip this one.
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|\\"Amon Amarth\\" is one of the few death metal bands that manages to be epic, brutal and CATCHY all at once. I'm a big fan of the genre (avid consumer) and I was absolutely enthralled by the sheer addiction factor of this album. The musicianship is excellent... ranging from melodic/cinematic guitar riffs to tight and spot-on drumming to well textured growls... The instruments sound gold here! Overall, I could see this becoming one of my favorite metal albums ever (right up there with Becoming the Archetype's \\"Physics of Fire\\"!)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Okay, okay, even though I'm NOT a big fan of racing, I loved this book and got how racing was so important to the story.  I was so caught in the emotion of this book that I laughed out loud and cried real tears. Even if you're not a dog lover, you'll love this book!
159562015X|1.0|For $24.95 this book doesn't give you much beyond the resources you can find at online resources for free, such as [...].      If you don't get it new then the online access code has already been used and you won't be able to get online to take their test which renders all but 36 pages of this book useless.    After the first 36 pages, the remainder of the book is meant as a reference for you to look up what is relevant to you as determined by the online test, all the information you'll get from those remaining 150ish pages is also available on their website after you take the exam.    Essentially, this book tells you almost nothing beyond your average online career strengths test and they could have saved themselves and their customers time and money if they just offered the test as an online service.  If you're hoping for a book that presents its readers with an in-depth understanding of different types of people and the methods one can use to identify themselves and then capitalize on that knowledge then this is not your book.  This is more of a broad, open-ended introduction to such concepts.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|I don't even know where to begin. Everything involved with this concert was flawless. Clapton was amazing and Winwood was as good as ever. Stoked to see Clapton do Forever Man (thanks to Winwoods request{bonus material]). Winwoods voice seemingly hasn't aged and his guitar work surprised me. The backing band was what you would expect from a Clapton project. Tight and on point. Also including the creepy long haired troll guy on keyboard. The camera work on this dvd is great. Catching some really good moments that show these two guys love what they do. I recommend a 12 pack and an entire night to watch and rewatch this dvd. Just fantastic and currently the best concert I have on dvd.
B0058VW36U|1.0|Crashes non-stop on the Droid. Can't even start any level any more. No response from Amazon support. I will cancel my account if it's just assumed I won't act on having money stolen from me.
0061537969|5.0|This book came along when I need to feel good about the compassion shared between humans and good souls who are meant to be together. It served as a wonderful reminder that we create our own destiny and left me feeling incredibly inspired and just happy. I loved Enzo and will definitely now be thinking a bit more as my pup does... :)    So glad to have picked this book up and would highly recommend.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Bloody terrific. I know about the financial and political crookedness before watching this movie. The movie glues the reality and slippery nature of the players that a print piece cannot.  After watching the movie I want to wring these thieves and slime bankers filthy necks.  Worth getting, worth watching and worth sharing with friends to get their hackles up also.
0740797719|5.0|To rave about this book is pretty unnecessary considering every other person who has written a review on it has given it 5 stars, and I have done the same. I love owning good books, especially art /graphic ones because I enjoy being able to get away from my computer and actually feel something between my hands as I read and learn, theres a whole lot more to the experience for me which I wont go into. This book is something I will keep for life and you will too. It is beautifully illustrated and is jammed packed with information and observations about light and color that I never really thought about or knew existed. There is so much info here that I will be re-reading it over again probably several times in order to absorb everything the author has to say and I will enjoy it each time I read it. Did I say the illustrations were beautiful? I am blown away by the technical expertise and knowledge the author has in order to render such  outstanding illustrations. I wish I  read this book back in college so that I could even have a chance at being this good 20 years later, however I am wrapped to be able to have this treasure in my hands now and relearn the basics and intricacies of our beautiful world we live in.
B000QFCD2W|3.0|I bought this album upon it's release, and I was actually turned off by King Diamonds vocal approach.  Up to that point I had only heard his 80's albums and his Fate material.  In recent years he had/has adopted a less \\"piercing\\" falsetto, as well as taken the disgust out of his low end vocals.  The music itself has flashes of King Diamond brilliance, but overall this album could pass you by and you might not even notice it.  \\"Shapes of Black\\" might be the best cut off here, it is a creepy and somewhat haunting piece.  There is all sorts of orchestration outside of the typical guitar shredding, it's an awesome song.  \\"Give Me Your Soul\\" is a really catchy and simple riff song, with an unholy solo section courtesy Andy La Rocque and new addition Mike Wead.  The formula for this album is pretty sparse, most songs are dominated by a slow and simple guitar riff with a interesting theme or melody at the beginning.  Then 3 quarters through an amazing solo section usually appears.  This isn't a negative quality persay, but there is little to no conviction in these riffs.  As for the story, this is certainly one of King Diamonds lesser projects on that front.  It has potential, a little girl trying to steal his soul for her little brother so he won't go to hell unjustly.  It just doesn't deliver.  And that's really the story about this album, it doesn't really deliver.  For King Diamond fans only.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Lots of inconsistencies in the materials... Contradictions and superstitions. I'm waiting for version 2.0 with updated genesis chapter, a revised 10 commandments, and a female lead.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This is the best book I've read this year. Absolute page turner. Read it front to back in less than 2 (working) days. Very very good. I hope to see it made into a movie...already daydreaming about who will play the main characters...I vote for Emma Thompson as Christine and Clive Owen as Ben.
0470449764|5.0|When i searched about GMAT from internet after i decided to take this exam, many says that people should stick with the official guide blah blah blah. I did not follow that rule until recently. After purchasing and reviewing the book, i thought, man! i should have done that earlier.   Here i am again telling you ... stick with the official guide book which is far better organized and explained.   I mean, there are several subjects (in math) that is not covered on my previous unofficial gmat books. Plus when correct answer is explained, it always include the original question itself, which was helpful (i dont have to turn pages again and again searching what was the question like etc.)  Overall great book, i am happy with my purchase and i got my books just in a few days.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|I'm not only saddened by some of the negative comments regarding this movie, I'm also somewhat disturbed. I won't put this film on a pedestal claiming it's the best film to come out the same year but it's hardly the trash some reviews have chalked it up as. Amazon compared it to Moulin Rouge, WTF!? Underneath this visually stunning film is a great story that comes off as intelligent, emotional and chock full of dark gritty drama. Some just couldn't see past the visuals or the girls and the outfits they wear or were probably disappointed because they expected more skin. Snyder's work is somewhat underrated in that he doesn't get enough credit for placing a fantastically laid-out film in the middle of his visual wizardry; the death scene of Leonidas in 300 is a perfect example of this. In Sucker Punch, the scene where the girls are confronted by Blue Jones because he's figured out their plan is utter brilliance in the structure of the movie, the performances and how it was placed on screen. This movie isn't for anyone and in an sense making a film like this is a new direction for the industry, visual effects that aren't sterile, included for vanity or overshadow the actual movie. Sucker Punch is the kind of film that brings a smile to my face in view of all the other pointless garbage Hollywood drones out. One of my friends was proud to take her daughters to see this and they all loved it claiming it to be the ultimate \\"girl power\\" movie showing girls they can rise up from anything. If you could see the intelligence and artistry laid out in 300 or The Watchmen then absolutely watch this movie. If you don't like it, Hollywood made three Transformers films instead.
B00005JPUN|4.0|So this was a flop upon release, though it's hard to see why. It's taut, creepy, tightly edited and shot very well. Nicole Kidman does one of her better acting jobs here as the mom who won't give on saving her young son from the body snatchers. If you know the 50s original or the 1978 remake, you will probably enjoy this one, too.
B002WY65W4|3.0|So many Blu-Ray / DVD reviewers miss the point of these reviews. If I wanted a review of the movie, I'd go to Rotten Tomatoes. The purpose is to review the package you're about to purchase, which is what I'm going to do.<br /><br />If I were just reviewing the movie itself, I'd give it 5 stars. Great, great movie, humorous, fun. BluRay quality is great. My beef is the fact that the box says \\"BluRay + Digital Copy\\". For whatever reason, digital copies expire. The disc is with the movie, your digital copy is locked away on it, but the package does not include the code to unlock it because in very fine print on the back of the box is the disclaimer: \\"digital copy expires 2/2011.\\" Is it made with eggs and milk? Why would it expire? If the file was being stored on a server somewhere and it was a matter of storage space, I'd understand, but the file *is on the disc in my hands* and I can't get it off.<br /><br />I applaud the movie studios for figuring out that there are lots of people who like to take movies with them on mobile devices, and doing the digital copies in the first place. But if you're going to do it, don't make it expire arbitrarily.
1932100660|4.0|I just finished The China Study and I can't change my diet fast enough. This book really points out the need for all of us to switch to a plant based diet. It covered the issue from every perspective. At times I wish that it was written in more layman's terms as I had to re-read thing a few times before I grasped the concept. But it was worth it.
B0000262I4|5.0|This Norma has been sadly missing from my experience. Working at my computer this morning and tuned to French streaming radio, I heard the chords of the 'Mira, O Norma,' and when I recognized T.T. (my nickname for this most flawless of all mezzo's), I wondered,<br />'But who is the Norma' ? (not a bad cocktail party line either, applicable to many, many situations).<br /><br />The timbre of both voices is  shaded, their tones covered in umbral twilights and otherworldly blended. Shame on me, I had to check the radio station's program listing, and shocker -- I neither own nor ever heard this recording. Thank God,  more is revealed all the time.
B003UESJEM|4.0|An economic downturn is usually accompanied by art which reflect, talk and discuss about the effects such a downturn has on the psyche and lives of the common man. The Company Men is such a movie as it explores the effects of job loss, privilege and the subsequent problems that dog the once very powerful men and their eventual humbling because of that. The film features three men who are high level executives in GTX Corporation and are laid off because the CEO is resisting a buyout offer from a rival and the only way that he could successfully resist this hostile takeover is by boosting the stock price. Stock markets generally react positively to news of cutbacks and these cutbacks would be trimming the workforce. These men are, Ben Affleck, a man who once dreamt of becoming a CEO but forced to move in with his parents and work with his brother in law (Kevin Costner) in construction. Tommy Lee Jones, one of the founding members of this company and one of the few people who still worries about letting people go in the name of cutbacks. Finally there is Chris Cooper, a man who has difficulty fitting in the workforce after spending much of his adult life working for the same corporation.<br />Although most of the proceedings focus on Ben Affleck and his attempt to cope with his job loss. While on the topic of the lives of the once mighty, we also have Kevin Costner who is relegated to playing a side role. This is still a great film about the harsh realities and broken dreams a job loss could bring. One must also not forget that these men who were once proud could have inflicted the same tragedy on someone else. I liked the film. Four stars.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I had purchased this film because I had read about how it was much truer to the original concept of the sequel.  Having seen the original theatrical cut of Superman II, I must concur; this Richard Donner cut is much truer to the \\"comic book vision\\".  The ill placed slapstick is excised and the re-edited film has a better flow.  A highly recommended purchase!
0060853972|5.0|Witty, funny, angels, demons, an apocalypse, witch hunters, the Antichrist, and sex. There's not much else you can ask for in a book honestly. It's a good story, a bit confusing at first if you have difficulty keeping track of different groups of characters, but once they all start interacting with each other you begin to catch on. It also includes footnotes, which are nice if you ever wondered how tall (very) minor antagonists happened to be, or how the old money system worked.<br /><br />*As far as the cover goes, it's either the white cover with demon Crowley on it or the black with angel Aziraphale - not a double cover book. I don't know who decides what you get, but when I bought my copy there wasn't any way to specify, not that it matters. I ended up with the black cover, and it hasn't hindered the readability of the book whatsoever.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wow! Dont listen to any bad reviews. Its awesome. 5 stars. Wow. Its interesting how Charlie thinks, and how he makes you think different (in a positive way, of course).  He takes average day things, and thinks about them, and its true. What he says. Its not only that. Its interesting to hear his painful stories, because there is depression in it. But it is REALLY good. Second favourite book of all time. My first is Speak :D

B004TACMZ8|3.0|I have much experience with wall scanners. As an avid handyman, I've tried them all, still searching for the golden one that actually will find wall studs with better than 50 percent accuracy. And by 50 percent, I mean 1 empty drilled hole for each one that is actually drilled into a stud.<br /><br />What I liked about this sensor is that it has exceptional build quality. It feels like a precision instrument. The battery compartment actually has the contacts built into the compartment instead of having those awful fragile snap clips on the red and black wires trailing out of the instrument. The display backlight is exceptionally nice. I like that you don't have to keep a button pressed while scanning, just leave it on. If you forget to turn it off, it auto offs in 5 minutes. The metal scan mode is quite nice and the best working sensing feature of the unit. The instrument is nicely made and generally well thought-out. I like that it comes with a case. The wrist strap is very thoughtfully provided and something these scanners have needed for a long time. Bosch seems to have tried hard on this effort.<br /><br />What I didn't like is the illuminated ring. It turns green, yellow, orange, and red but so what? It tells me nothing that I can't see on the display and it is too confusing/flashing to make any sense. You can get a particular color display and then scan back over that same spot and get nothing. You'll find, I think, that you'll ignore the light eventually and concentrate on the LCD screen which is actually reporting what is happening with the scan. The unit is nearly blind to AC wiring. Sometimes it hits, sometimes it misses. I would not bet my life on there being no live ac when this unit reports such.<br /><br />Scanning an interior wall I constructed myself, and knowing where all the studs, firestops, wiring etc. are, I often could not find a clear indication of a stud. Tapping the wall still works best for me. I'm sending the Bosch back since, for me, it is no better at finding studs than I am by rapping the wall with my knuckles.studs than I am by rapping the wall with my knuckles.

076535618X|5.0|John Scalzi's The Last Colony completes the trilogy begun by his award-winning Old Man's War. In this book, we return to John Perry's 1st person perspective, which is quite nice, since that's where the story began.<br /><br />The Last Colony finds Perry married to Jane Sagan, the former Special Forces soldier, and living on a newish colony. They have adopted Zoe Boutin, the little girl from Ghost Brigades and they are working as the administrators etc. of the colony where they live. Living with them are two Obin, Hickory and Dickory, who are essentially bodyguards for Zoe due to the fact that her biological father gave the Obin consciousness and they revere Zoe like a goddess. Perry and Sagan's life is good and things feel more or less like home. More or less. Remember that these two are privy to some of the more secret knowledge that the Colonial Union has seen fit to keep from the rest of humanity.<br /><br />John and Jane are approached and asked to head up a new colony on a planet called Roanoke. If you know the story of the historical Roanoke, you can be sure that Scalzi did not just pull this name out of a hat. This new colony, they are told, is an attempt to satisfy some political machinations as well as avoid the notice of the Conclave, a union of multiple alien peoples.<br /><br />The problem is that John and Jane are not given all of the information, and as the story unfolds, it becomes clear to them that they and the colonists in their charge are being used as tools by the Colonial Union. With the Conclave presented as the apparent baddy, the Colonial Union as the secretive and murky but more or less good guys, and the colonists at the center of a nasty conflict, the story trucks along just fine.<br /><br />Scalzi does a nice job showing how colonies in his world work. A nice twist comes when the colonists must depend on Mennonites and their particular skill set to survive their first year. The colonists are real people and Scalzi is at his best fleshing out these people and letting a nice brew boil as motivations and goals come into conflict. The conflicts between the colonists feel authentic and are very compelling.<br /><br />But then along comes the question: Who's really the bad guy? And another question: Just how far is the Colonial Union willing to go to protect its interests? And then: Will the Conclave wage total war on humanity now? And then: Exactly how are the colonists of Roanoke, with John and Jane at the helm, going to get out of their nasty fix?<br /><br />Scalzi's a smart guy. It's quite nice when the end of a book has action that is more than just shooting and explosions but has the winners coming out ahead because of intelligence, creativity, and compassion. This book ends not unpredictably, but in a very satisfying manner, the story that Scalzi began with Old Man's War.<br /><br />I felt that the one area that needed work was (spoiler alert!) the discovery of indigenous intelligent life on the planet of Roanoke. This was treated briefly, but then seemed to be forgotten.<br /><br />All in all, however, the book is excellent. Engaging as always and startling in its robust world and fascinating characters and aliens. And all that combined with a keen eye for deeper questions and true humanity. Solid stuff, my friends.<br /><br />I give it 5 out of 5 pens.nice brew boil as motivations and goals come into conflict.

B0036S4B6M|3.0|This is the story of Piper Kerman, a graduate of Smith College, who was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institute in Danbury, CT. As someone who lives in the greater Danbury area and frequently passes the majestically placed prison on Candlewood Lake, I was interested to learn about life on the inside.    I liked this book and found it interesting. It's not the country club federal minimum security prisons are made out to be. Adjusting to prison life, its rules and hierarchies is a complicated process. \\"The camp had distinct rhythms of frenzied action and lulls of calm, like a high school or an ER ward.  In bursts of activity the polyglot of women came and went, clustered in groups...chattered in an overwhelming rush of noise, accents, and emotions mixed into swirling eddies of language.\\"      Kerman does a really good job of sharing her experience and insights about life on the inside, as well as the lives of the other prisoners/cell mates/friends she encounters. She brings to life the demeaning, controlled lifestyle and the ever-changing social dynamics of a very faulty system.

B003UESJH4|5.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" strings together jewel-like sequences like beads on a chain, such that the moviemaking and ensemble acting on view is perhaps stronger than significane of the historical event depicted, though the importance of kingly speeches during war is not to be dismissed.<br /><br />On first viewing, \\"The King's Speech\\" falls into the category of a historical British import, in the spirit of the Merchant-Ivory offerings of the 1980s and 1990s, with older versions of Merchant-Ivory ensembles -- Derek Jacoby as the archbishop of Canterbury, Helena Bonham Carter as Bertie's wife, Timothy Spall as Churchill, and so forth. You settle back for the plot to unfold, and as the Colin Firth notes (paraphrasing) on the DVD extras, to whit: Prince meets speech therapist, prince loses speech therapist, prince regains speech therapist.<br /><br />On second viewing, the beautiful construction of the film becomes apparent. We have no chronological jumps. Each sequence is self-contained and flows into the next. We start with an innocent enough event: Bertie (Colin Firth), the son of King George V, needs to give a speech to close an exhibition at Wembley. He walks with the good cheer of a condemned man down corridors, up a stairs and out to the terrace to address the waiting multitudes. He stammers and pauses and creates discomfort and fidgeting in the audience. Unknown to him, and to the viewer at this early juncture in the audience, an Australian actor with success in helping stammerers is in onlooking crowd. And his son is going to lean over and ask him, \\"Do you think you can help that man?\\"<br /><br />Bertie, who would later become King George VI, didn't have any inkling that he would in effect have to stand up to Hitler and help Winston Churchill rally a nation. His wife, Elizabeth, the mother of Princesses Elizabeth and Ann, finds Lionel Logue, a speech therapist and not the first, to help her husband. She's unaware of the machinations of the head of the therapist society to have Logue's name advanced to help Bertie. Her timing is fantastic, as history is about to require a more brave if less eloquent ascender to the throne than Bertie's brother Edward, who would eventually abdicate to marry Wallis Simpson.<br /><br />Along the way, we have fantastic casting at every corner: Australian Geoffrey Rush as Logue, Michael Gambon as Bertie's father, George V; the finest actors of the British stage of the last two generations appear here. Finely honed scriptwriting brings us peak scenes as when Logue says sternly, \\"My game, my turf, my rules\\" to the prince on his first testy visit, as Logue tries to establish \\"trust and total equality in the safety of my consultation room.\\" Firth skillfully establishes Bertie's pride, disarming charm and difficult side when he blurts \\"one of my many faults!\\" when Logue calls him on his temper.<br /><br />Sets are intriguing: Logue's house has explosive and strange merled painting on the walls, and the young princesses Ann and Elizabeth a stableful of wooden horses in a scene of comforting domesticity. The BBC's broadcasting station feeds royal speeches to every corner of empire, with wire boxes labeled Antigua, Kenya and so forth. A stroll in Regent's Park is London as a fairy tale.<br /><br />A subtheme in the film is the role of family: Bertie tells a charming tale of a penguin to his daughters, complete with subtle wit, improvisation and stammer. Logue is an equally engaged father, who plays \\"guess the Shakespeare play\\" with his boys (\\"Time for Shakes, Dad?\\"). These domestic scenes contrast with Bertie's confession to Logue that he was closest to his nannies, \\"but not the first,\\" who pinched him and did not feed him, a deficiency not noted by his parents for three years.<br /><br />The core of the movie of course are the sparks that fly as Logue tries to cut down a prince to be his equal, and Bertie fights back fiercely, over everything from whether Bertie can smoke in Logue's office to whether firstnames are acceptable. There's subtle drama as Bertie reads Shakespeare while wearing headphones that blast music to calm his tongue. The two fight stormily and make up. Once back on track learning the tricks of public speaking, Bertie attempts strenuous exercises, including rolling on the carpet, to learn how to relax the body, diaphragm and throat.<br /><br />Logue carries secrets that come to light after digging by the appalled archbishop, but he staunchly defends his methods and himself with great aplomb. With so many beautiful scenes here, multiple viewings may be rewarding. \\"The King's Speech\\" serves as a primer on moviemaking and learning from history, without an explosion or CGI effect in sight; or perhaps only a few, such as rendering crowd scenes at Wembley and outside Buckingham Palace.<br /><br />The film has peaks when Bertie and Logue first meet, when Logue roars back a defense when the king's associates attack him, and when Bertie -- prepped and morally supported by Logue -- makes a pivotal speech when England declares war on Nazi Germany. Enjoy each scene unfurling as Bertie finds a second friend -- to equal the friendship with his wife - in his evolution from lonely lad to competent king.e reads Shakespeare while wearing headphones that blast music to calm his tongue.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|Corolle makes very high-quality, beautiful baby dolls.  In my opinion, they are the nicest dolls out there.  I looked at all the models and chose this one because I thought it had the prettiest face of all the Corolle dolls.  The Corolle Nourisson and Suce Pouce are also very pretty, but the Calin Charming Pastel won out for its smaller size and reasonable price.  I like that it has a bean-bag body and is small enough for a one-year-old to carry around.  I gave this as a birthday gift for a one-year-old, but liked it so much that I plan to buy another for my own baby.  The specs say 18 months and up, but there don't seem to be any chokeable parts that would present a hazard for younger children.

0061726826|4.0|Last year I read Lauren Oliver's magnificent and breathtaking debut novel, Before I Fall, and this year yet another Oliver book has fully captivated me. This time it was Delirium, a new addition to dystopian lit. Fascinating, intense, and romantic, Delirium is a book you simply cannot miss.    Delirium takes place in a startling future, one where love does not exist past your eighteenth birthday, as not only is love now a horrifying disease, but also one that must be removed no matter what the consequence. For Lena, this has never been a big deal. She actually eagerly anticipates the time in which she will have the procedure, counting down the days. However, everything changes when she meets Alex. With Alex, she begins to live, see a new way of life, and most importantly, she starts to fall in love. However, with the day of her procedure coming closer and closer, Lena knows she has to think of a way to save herself and keep Alex. However, will she be able to do both before time runs out? Only time and more pages can tell in this fast-paced and addicting new addition to YA.    The one thing I always love about Lauren's books is the way she not only completely fleshes out her characters, but also allows them to grow and evolve as time goes on. At first, Lena is somewhat like a zombie, following the government's way of living with little question or outburst. However, once the book starts going and she meets Alex, she begins to come alive. She starts to question life, love, and happiness, and most importantly, she becomes fierce and a fighter.    The plot in this book was great. Lauren brought Lena's world to life through her descriptions and characters, and most importantly, she did a good job of fleshing out the bond between Lena and Alex. While Lena and Alex's romance does play an important in the book, my favorite of their relationship was how it not only allowed for them to see new ways of live in some ways, but the question it also arises throughout the book about love and happiness and the risks you take. I also enjoyed reading about Lena's friendship with Hana, her best friend, as well as the tensions and twists that arrived with her mother's death. It all caused for lots of tension as well as twists and turns.    Oliver's writing was also great, as alluded to above. Just like with Before I Fall, she allowed for the story to come alive. Lastly, while the ending was sad and shocking, it was a great turn and I look forward to seeing what will occur next.    Memorizing, enthralling, and full of characters you cannot help but adore and root for, Delirium is a fabulous second novel- one that leaves me even more eager to read more by Oliver in the future.    Grade: A-

B0034G4P8K|3.0|The Review:<br /><br />Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the latest and final installment of the film series based on the 1980s line of Hasbro toys that spawned the popular cartoon series and cult animated film. Michael Bay is in full effect here, surpassing the prior live action films in terms of storytelling and explosions--lots and lots of explosions. The first Transformers film was decent, but the follow-up, Revenge of the Fallen was an awful mess. Fortunately, Dark of the Moon makes up for its predecessor with better pacing, excellent fan service, some comic relief, a very clever set up and amazing action sequences.<br /><br />Shia LaBeouf reprises his role, but Megan Foxx is nowhere to be found, replaced by the equally arresting Rosie Huntington-Whitely.  But more importantly, Optimus Prime, voiced by Peter Cullen, is back. Let's face it; every human is a bit player standing next to a 20 foot tall robot, who looms even larger in the minds of those of us who watched the cartoons in the 80s.  The Autobots and Decepticons are examples of computer generated actors that routinely upstage their human costars thanks to the wizardry of Industrial Light and Magic. Serious fans of Transformers that recall the original animated movie will recognize the voice talent of Leonard Nimoy, who is the voice of Galvatron from the original animated movie. Look out for the clever reference to another Nimoy character early in the film that foreshadows one of Dark of the Moon's awesome twists.<br /><br />The premise of Dark of the Moon is that the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union was a cover to retrieve autobot technology that crash-landed on the moon. Control of that technology will determine not only the victor in the ongoing war between the Autobots and Decepticons, but the fate of mankind as well. Corny? Perhaps, but if I didn't know better, the production values of Dark of the Moon suggest Michael Bay rented the Space Shuttle Columbia and sent a film crew to film huge chunks of the movie in space. The FX are impeccably done with only one scene early on that looks (forgivably) fake.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Dark of the Moon is a bombastic action film that is competently written. It succeeds primarily on the strength of its special effects and benefits from favorable comparison to the inferior Revenge of the Fallen which preceded it. The movie is for the most part lighthearted, but in the final act it shifts tone and becomes much darker. It becomes surprisingly violent and pushes the boundaries of its PG-13 rating. Oddly, robot on robot violence seems to give the film makers license to amp up the carnage. The robots are so lifelike that there's an eerie human quality to their very violent clashes that I found a bit jarring. The violence was also in stark contrast to the films earlier, often comedic moments. If you enjoyed the two prior films then you will enjoy Dark of the Moon which does homage to the spirit of the Transformers in explosive Michael Bay fashion.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.the movie in space.

The book is very cute, few words so you can make up the story depending on your child's age. The pages in black with white eyes scared my 1 year old at first and I'd have to skip over those pages, but now he likes them. Definitely a book your child can grow into. The paperback is so thin though, so I'll probably end up getting this again in another format.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|After watching the 1st season of Stargate Universe I wasn't impressed. The teamwork that made SG1 and Atlantis such hits was absent. But in the second season things changed. The Destiny crew seemed to pull together more and a great enemy was introduced The Drones.  The show ended in a cliffhanger, but not as tense as Season 1. I understand the producers intended to make a Stargete Universe movie that would resolve the series finally. But that project was scrapped. Season 2 is well worth purchasing despite leaving you hanging. Hopefully a movie will be produced to tie off this last loose end.

B004EJUMT2|3.0|The song Ritual is a very nicely crafted pop song, featuring more hooks than a fisherman's tackle box and it is catchier than a cold. Unfortunately the rest of the album, in my humblest of opinions, doesn't even come close to matching this.<br />In their bio Ghost claim to be for-real satanists who want to convert followers to their cause through the music. Nice gimmick, but, come on, get real now fellas -you sound about as evil as Justin Bieber.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with the music as such, but it ain't really what I would call heavy metal and it all sounds a bit pretend. The vocalist does sound a bit similar to King Diamond (not the high bits), but that's where the similarities end. Maybe a better production could have lifted this album to loftier heights, but as it stands it reminds me of Lordi - ie too much emphasis on image, not enough on the music.<br /><br />Still, if every band could have a song as good as Ritual in their debut, then the world would be better for it (or more evil perhaps, mwah ha ha...).Oh, and I love the cover.

B0050XFY4O|5.0|We can only hope to see a work of art such as this occasionally in our lifetime. The story is pure and honest, sincerely warm and loving, unspeakable and disturbing to many, and yet one of the most important and memorable love stories ever shown on film. Thomas and Francisco love each other more deeply than any two people ever possibly could. Without reservation, and unconditionally. It is absolutely because they are biologically brothers who have always loved and adored each other that makes the depth of the relationship possible, wonderful, and unbreakable. Their parents are exceptionally sensitive people who actually nurtured the relationship by allowing it to thrive.    After watching the film, I knew that these relationships must exist far more than we are aware of, and from as far back as near the beginning of time. Yet, they must always be kept as secretly as possible because of our infancy with regard to understanding ourselves as human beings. This film is stunningly beautiful in all aspects. Acting, scenery, dialog, writing, and a gorgeous cast. You'll want to watch it at least twice.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|The Critics can suck it on this one as far as I am concerned.  I was not expecting Oscar worthy art house drama here.  If I wanted to fall asleep I would go watch The Tree of Life.  Its a movie about aliens invading earth and has some really kick ass action scenes in it.  Its a bit dopey and yes its a bit hokey but if you are looking for good old fasioned escapism this is about as good as it gets.
B003UESJIS|5.0|ANOTHER YEAR is another victory for Mike Leigh.  How he is able to write and create characters that embody the problems we all see around us and in us is nothing short of a little miracle.  This film is a microcosm of extended families and how they circle around the wounded members like feral animal groups, protecting, feeding, tending  and nurturing even the most impaired ones so that they know they are safe.  Leigh tackles a  number of problems we are seeing in our society - alcoholism, drug dependency, depression, coping with death, dissociation between child and parent, aging, retirement, an other forms of human frailties and instead of preaching about them he simply places his characters representing these problems before us for our consideration.<br /><br />The film opens quietly with an interview between a severely depressed insomniac Janet (Imelda Staunton) and a kind healthcare provider Tanya (Michele Austin): Janet just wants sleeping pills but finally agrees to accept Tanya's advice to seek counseling - Janet's counselor is Gerri (Ruth Sheen) who happens be one half of the couple that glues this film together, her husband being geologist Tom (Jim Broadbent).  This opening encounter sets the tone for the film: there are those who are genuinely happy (Tom and Gerri, both at retirement age but very close and share their hobby of gardening with the many friends who seek solace in their presence.  They have a son Joe (Oliver Maltman) who visits often, alone, sensitive about the fact that he is 30 and without a mate.  Their other friends in various stages of neediness include Mary (Lesley Manville, in a stunning performance) as divorced and deserted alcoholic whose loquacious self-centered personality usually ends her visits by sleeping over, unable to drive.  Mary feels her problems will resolve if she has a car and proceeds to buy a used car that is as undependable and prone to problems as is Mary.  Of interest, Gerri, Tanya and Mary all work in the same establishment and Tanya is also a frequent guest at Tom and Gerri's comfortable and comforting home.  Another frequent visitor is Tom's friend Ken (Peter Wight), an aging and lonely obese man who drinks constantly and fears going to his own quite empty solitary house: he is so desperate for female companionship that he approaches the needy Mary who will have nothing to do with him.  Mary fantasizes  a pairing with Joe, but the fantasy crashes when Joe finally brings home a girlfriend Katie (Karina Fernandez).<br /><br />The film is divided into seasons - spring, summer, autumn, winter - and as the seasons pass the only evidence of progress is the well ended garden of Tom and Gerri, a garden that is as happy and productive as its owners. As winter approaches a new character is introduced - Tom's brother Ronnie (David Bradley) has just lost his wife when he discovers her dead body beside him one morning.  He turns to  Tom and Gerri for support and they with their extended family attend the simple funeral, a funeral completed by the time Ronnie's absentee angry son Carl (Martin Savage) arrives.  In the tiny wake that follows the camera dwells on each of the faces of the 'tribe' - lingering last on the empty vessel of Mary - and begs the question 'Why can some people find happiness while others cannot even imagine it?.'<br /><br />Writer/director Mike Leigh's ability to create profoundly moving stories simply by placing his camera on ordinary people's lives is a unique gift as a filmmaker. He is less interested in presenting answers as in posing questions, and he is aided in this successful effort with the work of some of Britain's finest actors. This is a gentle but powerful film.

B0034G4P7G|5.0|Fans of the movies always seem to adopt films as defining their youth.  For my folks, it was hard to beat \\"The Graduate.\\"  For me and my friends, John Hughes' \\"Sixteen Candles\\" and \\"The Breakfast Club\\" capture the careening highs and lows of being a teenager in Reagan's America better than any other movie.  I imagine that college students of the last decade will look to David Fincher's \\"The Social Network\\" and say, \\"Yeah, they got it right.\\"    \\"TSN\\" is not a documentary by any means, but despite focusing on the meteoric rise of the world's youngest billionaire, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), and the founding of Facebook, \\"TSN\\" gets to the heart of what it means to be a young adult in the age of the Internet.  Zuckerberg's genius was that he could step back and recognize the desperate human need for social connections and he was able to translate it to the Internet.  Older generations may see younger Americans as a batch of loners as they sit glued to their laptops or PDAs, hammering out emails and texts while seemingly ignoring the world around them.  But thanks to Zuckerberg, the youth of America are connected as never before.    In lesser hands, the story of the creation of a website would bore you to tears.  Instead, Fincher took a script by Aaron Sorkin, one of the most incisive, thrilling writers we have, and created a fascinating tale of the creative spark and the toll it took on friendships.  The \\"hero\\" of this story could only be Zuckerberg, but Zuckerberg fails almost every test of heroism.  A social outcast at Harvard, Zuckerberg should cherish the few friendships he has, but he uses blatantly lies to friends and colleagues.  He willingly \\"trades up\\" from his best friend and business partner, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), when the bigger-and-better-deal comes along in the form of Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), founder of Napster.  And so it is that Sorkin and Fincher are able to use two competing lawsuits to structure this complex story as wellas give it a Rashomon-style changing perspective.    I'll leave it to others to recap the plot details, other than to say that this is a complex, dense story. Sorkin won his Oscar for best screenplay for telling this story with such energy and style.  The early scene showing the creation of Facemash, with its hacking and e-gibberish, deserves heavy analysis by every wannabe-writer out there.  The special effects are subtle but powerfully effective, including having Baltimore and Johns Hopkins step in for Boston and Harvard as well as allowing Armie Hammer to play both Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (with a major boost from Josh Pence).    All the performances are strong, but special kudos need to go to Eisenberg and Garfield for playing best friends who go to war over Facebook.  Eisenberg personifies the wounded little genius who exacts his revenge on his best friend for (largely imagined) grievances, while Garfield plays the loyal friend who gets pushed too far.  In a director's commentary, Fincher gives a lot of credit to these two actors, but it's safe to assume that Fincher coaxed these two actors along.      All in all, a fabulous collaboration and a defining movie for the Aughts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Every once in a while a story comes along that really draws you into the life of the characters.  This is one of those stories.  It is not always fast paced, but extremely rich in detail, providing ample opportunity to understand the characters.  One word of warning though, this is the first book in a trilogy and if you read one you will read them all.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I will write this review in two parts, because there are two important aspects to this particular edition of this series:<br /><br />1. The Series, Itself - FANTASTIC<br />Martin writes a gritty fantasy epic, that truly IS epic. Raw, dark, honest, but full of liars, this series will shatter any notion you have that fantasy is for kids, or that adults cannot have their pleasures. Martin does not shy away from butchering his characters, yes even the main ones, and this lends a sense of urgency and real alarm to the series.  Find yourself liking one of his characters? Watch it, that character could be next.  Meanwhile, the dishonorable and \\"evil\\" in the series really seem to get away with their acts. While the series is not without the comeuppance of evil, get used to darkness thriving, as Martin does not pull his punches. There's a reason HBO has been successful, and a large portion of that reason is the source material.<br /><br />2. The Kindle Edition - JUST FINE!<br />I've seen complaints about the Kindle edition being horrible, from the formatting to the fact that it's 4 books squished into one. I have seen nothing that convinces me that the Kindle edition is anything less than perfect. Yes, there are 4 books.  On the Android versions of the Kindle app, there is nothing to distinguish the books on the progress meter.  I am 31% of the way through the series, and I don't know when this book ends and the next begins.  On the Kindle, itself, however, there are marks where each book ends and the next begins, so you can more easily see where you are in the 4-book series.  However, there is a total Table of Contents (ToC) just after the cover of the Kindle book, so you can quickly jump to the beginning of any of the books.<br /><br />The formatting, also, receives no complaints from me.  I don't see how there could really be a problem...there are words, which are strung together to form sentences, which are likewise strung together to make paragraphs....what's the problem? New chapters start on a new \\"page\\".<br /><br />And with the kindle edition, you can bookmark and highlight the book to your heart's content. Honestly, it really is the best of all worlds.<br /><br />That being said, the paperback series is currently being sold for less than the Kindle version of the same product.  This is seriously annoying, as the Kindle edition does not have the overhead of paper, the printing process, etc...This is more a complaint about the pricing of kindle books by publishers than a complaint about this particular book, however.<br /><br />Verdict: Awesome series, in an awesome format.  I love not having to carry around multiple books when I'm getting close to finishing one.  I also love being able to read on multiple devices, and having the latest page read sync to each device.  All standard features of a Kindle book!page\\".    And with the kindle edition, you can bookmark and highlight the book to your heart's content. Honestly, it really is the best of all worlds.

B004SGWYVA|1.0|I really wanted to like this. I love zombies and anime. So when I heard about this I was super exited only to be seriously let down.<br /><br />First the show has no set tone. It tries to balance serious characterization with over the top violence with titillation with comedy and ends up botching the whole thing. For example it has a bath scene where all of the (underage) female characters who have breasts too big to exist in nature are topless and it cuts back and forth between that and brutal violence all within less then a minute. This lack of consistency makes the audience not know what mindset to be in thus causing a huge headache.<br /><br />The characters are also a big problem. They try to shoehorn in depth to them but it seems like an afterthought. It's as if a sixth grader wrote them and that's not due to a bad translation the original Japanese version is even worse. They have two characters a pink haired girl and a future unibomber who are polar opposites yet for some reason they have what is laughably called a romance.<br /><br />This is one of the worst animes I've ever seen, if you're 14 and love violence and boobs you'll enjoy it but people looking for a legitimate take on a zombie outbreak should avoid it like the plague.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|Never in my entire life has an artist impacted me as deeply as David.  This album is just above and beyond my expectations these past two years waiting for it.  He is in a class of his own, I just don't have adequate words to express how wonderful this album is....no words are enough!   The music, lyrics and his voice totally penetrate my heart and soul....that is what his music does.  Magnificent just is not a good enough word.

B001USHRCK|5.0|Back in the 1980s, I was (a) rather smaller than I am today, and (b) totally obsessed with LEGO. I especially loved the medieval-themed LEGO sets, because knights are cool and I have a fondness for history. But even then, it bothered me that the medieval LEGO sets almost always consisted of castles, castles, and more castles (with the occasional catapult thrown in for good measure). I longed to build a huge medieval *village* for all these castles to protect; and here, a mere 30 years too late, is the village set that I craved as a child.    Well, I guess it's a bit much to call this set a whole village's worth of LEGO. It consists of a tavern, a blacksmith's shop/stable, and a food vendor, so it's really more like a town square. But the buildings are wonderfully detailed and colorful, and if you arrange them carefully you can create the impression of a vibrant community. It helps that the set comes with a fairly generous compliment of LEGO minifigures and animals, including some very peculiar chickens. (Almost unbelievably, it also comes with what appear to be two LEGO \\"turds,\\" which you're supposed to put on the floor of the stable!)    Building the set will be challenging for LEGO newcomers as there are a lot of pieces, many of them teeny-tiny. As is typical of LEGO, the pieces come in various bags that are not numbered or arranged in any kind of order; you'll need to open all the bags right away, dump their contents in piles, and hunt from pile to pile for the pieces you need at each step. This approach may annoy some people, but for me it's part of the fun and challenge of building a LEGO set.    In the final analysis, I think this is one of the best LEGO products out there. It has a level of detail and \\"class\\" that's missing from simpler sets, though it's perhaps not quite as nice as the expensive city sets like the Corner Cafe and the LEGO Emporium. Since LEGO sets have a tendency to drop out of circulation (and increase in price), I'd recommend picking thisup ASAP if you're interested; and Amazon's current price of around $100 is indeed pretty good (I paid about $10 more for this at the LEGO store in Rockefeller Center).

B0000YEEGM|5.0|My sister is 35 years old and autistic. I remember seeing this movie as a small child and relating to it instantly. Hoffman portrayed an Autistic man superbly. He was spot on. It is amazing that 25 years later there has been more awareness.  Nothing about autism is funny. I just wish I could get the answer to one question as I ask my sister, \\"Maureen. What is going on in your mind?\\"  This is a great movie. It brings me to tears every time I watch it.

B0050CQY1W|5.0|The only CD I have purchased this year that i can play every song. This is not your traditional Beyonce album. It kind of remind me of Toni Braxton's first and second album. The songs are more mature. The songs are delivered with more passion. She still reaches her core audiences with three songs at the end of the album. This album has the potential to be the album of the year at the Grammys.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Just got my Schrade SCHF9 knife, I am so pleased with this purchase, the knife came VERY sharp, it not a lightweight! but for it's intended purpose SURVIVAL, it should perform extremely well, same for a camping trip or just trekking through the wilderness. The blade is about 1/4 inch thick & full tang, it will do a great job at batoning. The sheath is quite nice for this price range,it came with a removable pouch with velcro tabs & you can  discard it if you wish, I decided to put a good quality Fire steel in it as well as a small container of water purification tabs (14 tabs), I mostly collect blades & other weapons but from time to time I will go on a walk into the Big Bear area not far from our home, we only go for half day trips but you never know what can happen so I am always prepared (And yes I was a Boy Scout many decades ago LOL), there are some wild animals out there, bears & mountain lions & of course the 2 legged kinds, so I always have a decent knife on my belt, my favorite being a BK9 or BK7, but this new knife is going to give them a run for the money LOL. The only thing I can fault it is the rubber grip, I have large hands & it feels ok but it seems like the finger grooves are spaced a bit too far apart? I 'll have a friend of mine take a look & maybe remove/re-adjust the grooves, no biggie though. I would highly recommend this knife specialy for the price that Amazon is offering & with NO shipping & handling fees!
