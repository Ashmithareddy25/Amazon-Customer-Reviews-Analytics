B005NGKMOU|4.0|I am a western movie fanatic. Blackthorn rates among some of the best westerns I have seen. The director is definitely influenced in Clint Eastwood's style in all aspects. Here is how I rate this movie<br />Scenery: 5/5 A nice change of the usual western scenes. Bolivia<br />Acting: 4/5 Some of the Bolivians actors were just not perfect<br />Costumes: 4/5 very good Overall<br />Music: 5/5 Lucio Godoy music fits so well in all scenes. The acoustic guitar gives it a great touch. Highly recommended.<br />Story: 5/5 love the story and the imagination, based on truth, since Cassidy's DNA did not match the body found in Bolivia.<br />Overall: Highly recommended<br />Similar good westerns:<br />1. 3.10 to Yuma<br />2. Pale rider<br />3. Unforgiven<br />4. High Plains Drifter<br />5. Broken Trail<br />Bravo Bolivia
B003D81NVQ|5.0|My wife just started to watch Breaking Bad on a recommendation from a friend.Very happy that we did this is great TV. This was also the first time we purchased a product from Amazon via our Blu Ray player's network. I am very pleased with the quality of the picture.<br /><br />We used iTunes for Season 2 and not only was it more expensive but the picture quality was not as good. It also took longer to load the episodes and watch. Once you purchase the episodes are ready right away.<br /><br />I would highly recommend using Amazon before any other internet source especially iTunes or OnDemand.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Sadly, I bought this book. I decided to see what it was all about and really wish I didn't. It is a scourge on the publishing industry.<br /><br />The writing is terrible. I've read better things on the back of a cereal box. Yes, it was that bad. Just as bad as the book (Twilight) is was originally based on as fan fiction. Before being rewritten.<br /><br />The characters are mediocre and it failed to intrigue me enough to want to read it to the end. I regret the purchase and you most likely will, too!<br /><br />Don't bother. If you want to read erotica, there is better sources.
1616550414|5.0|Since I saw I fell in love, as true fan of the series, really needed it, now that I have it and I keep reading, every detail is beautiful secrets worth reading for yourself, things that will leave you with the mouth open. Sure, if you're a fan of this beautiful legend

I got it for everyday use, but he was so happy with it, he is putting it up for special occasions.  Price was great!  His new bride was hoping it was for her after she opened it by mistake. But alas, too large for her tiny wrist.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|This is the 4th book by Jonh Green that I have read and I am again very impressed.  I am way past my teenage years, but find this story like his other novels transcending.  I am past the point of taking life affirming road trips, but now have a nostalgic longing to take one.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I love to read, but the library selections are not too inviting.  This one was so predictable and hum-drum.  Did have sympathy for the main character.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I'm not a huge Grisham fan, but this was pretty good.  Not necessarily a &#34;page turner&#34; but a good vacation read if you need one.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I was happy to see the admitted fault and that the character takes responsibility for actions;  against mainstream  politics.  Good acting and good character.  The problems people can get themselves into does not discriminate, so good the story was on target with this situation as well.  Sometimes the stereotype for durg/alcohol problems are not correct.  Anyone anywhere may end up with problems much bigger than they can handle on their own.  So glad the story represents a cross section with the plans of the politicians againto go for the money a cover truth.

B002MG0MF8|5.0|Released in 1950 and directed by Henry Koster, Harvey is the screen adaptation of the original hit Broadway play of the same name written by Mary Chase.<br /><br />Meet Elwood P Dowd.  He is gentle, charming, kind, sweet, generous, gregarious, and he will buy you a drink, or invite you to dinner within two seconds after just meeting you.  He loves life, and loves to enjoy every minute of it.  He likes martinis, good conversations and fresh flowers. He wants to introduce everyone he meets to his best friend, Harvey, who is constantly at his side.  The only problem is that \\"Harvey\\" is a six foot eight inch rabbit who is only visible to him.<br /><br />Fearing that Elwood has lost his mind, and tiring of being socially outcast because of her brother's \\"imaginary friend\\", his sister Veta-Louise,decides to have him committed to a mental hospital.  Distraught when she brought him in, the doctor in attendance is convinced that she is the one who needs treatment, so he  locks her up instead and sets Elwood free.  Realizing their mistake, the hospital staff go on a frantic search for Elwood and \\"Harvey\\", and along the way, they learn valuable lessons about themselves...and life.<br /><br />James Stewart not only portrays Elwood P Dowd, he becomes Elwood P Dowd.<br /><br />Josephine Hull, who plays Elwood's oft worried and frantic sister, Veta-Louise, reprises her critically acclaimed role from the original Broadway play.  Another big plus for this film is that Stewart and Hull are backed by a fine ensemble of supporting players, whose performances deserve a nod of appreciation as well.<br /><br />To put it bluntly, reality is overrated, and Harvey is a pure delight.  This gem of a film is a treasure that belongs in every classic movie lovers collection.<br /><br />Cast-<br /><br />Elwood P Dowd--------James Stewart<br />Veta Louise Simmons--Josephine Hull<br />Myrtle Mae-----------Victoria Horne<br />Dr. Chumley----------Cecil Kellaway<br />Dr Sanderson---------Charles Drake<br />Nurse Kelly----------Peggy Dow<br />Judge Gaffney--------William Lynn<br />Wilson---------------Jesse White<br />Taxi Driver----------Wallace Ford<br />Harvey---------------Himself<br />Nurse Kelly----------Peggy Dow<br />Judge Gaffney--------William Lynn<br />Wilson---------------Jesse White<br />Taxi Driver----------Wallace Ford<br />Harvey---------------Himself

If you are even remotely thinking of buying this book. Do it. You wont be sorry.<br /><br />Oh and by the way. You do not have to be into mountain climbing to appreciate this story.<br />You will get a taste of what a person will endure to survive when they have a will to do so.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|Beautiful movie. Love john & Kate but wish movie had more of them TOGETHER in it. Was sort of disappointing that the whole movie was leading UP to them actually being together then ends ... good romantic movie to add to collection though.

1576754227|5.0|Brian Tracy's twenty-one practical suggestions for getting more done in less time is just what I needed. It's fast paced (I read the book in one sitting, attaching Post-It flags  along the way), sensible and to the point. I recommend it to all who are bogged down and spinning their wheels instead of progressing steadily toward their goals.  I liked the way he carried his \\"eating the frog\\" idea  through every chapter with several doable suggestions at the end of each one.<br /><br />Following this author's advice, I set my number priority to be cleaning up my workspace by getting rid of the paper stashes permanently. That will be a major accomplishment, more mechanical than mental, but it is necessary to free me to follow through with those other twenty helpful suggestions.<br /><br />Brian's book is the first self-help book that has convinced me I can change my ways of working for the better and challenged me to start the first thing in the morning.  If you feel like your situation is hopeless, his suggestions are the antidote you need right now to encourage you to make the changes necessary to make to reach your goals.

B0049GYXDQ|5.0|We love Princess and The Frog. It is one of the best Disney Princess movies. I love the story, the music, and the animation. The voices are great too- my favorite is Ray the firefly. I like the the mother isn't dead in the movie, which isn't typical for the princess movies. She's a strong influence, as well as the father, which is great. I love that Tiana is encouraged to work hard and she's the heroine. Great movie.
B006CHML4I|5.0|This purchase was for an everyday rugged watch I wouldn't worry over if it got dirty or inadvertently was scratched.  Plan to wear with yardwork, sports, occasionaly water slides with the kids, hiking, etc.<br />Con:  strap closure is not as intutive as standard band.  Tail of watch band lightly &#34;snags&#34; fabric it brushes against - tips of synthetic threads were cauterized and these tiny microscopic ends are sharp.<br />Pro:  Durable, easy to read, no battery hassle with automatic movement.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|In Schindler’s List, Liam Neeson stars as Oskar Schindler, a businessman (and member of the Nazi party) that takes advantage of the invasion of Poland by the German army.  Once in Poland, Schindler uses his money to bribe Nazi officers, thus allowing him to take over a production facility – where he heavily profits from the production and sale of army mess supplies (using Jewish workers).  In order to run the business, he persuades a member of the Jewish business community, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kinglsey) to manage his books and finances.  However, once the Nazis start forcing Jews into ghettos, Schindler witnesses firsthand the senseless massacre of Jews – by SS officers, like Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), and becomes sympathetic to their struggle to survive under the Nazi occupation.  With his newfound wealth, Schindler does all he can to maintain his partnership with the Nazis, while protecting his Jewish production workers.  Embeth Davidtz, Caroline Goodall, and Jonathan Sagall also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />The film’s focal point, Oskar Schindler, serves as a neutral figure turned protagonist.  When we first meet this man on screen, he cares more about money and women than what’s happening around him.  It’s not until he sees the (now famous) girl in the red dress that he has a change of heart about the Jews.  However, he is smart enough to protect his Jewish workers in a legitimate way, while still appearing to be loyal to the Nazi party.  On the other hand, the antagonist – Nazi officer, Amon Goeth, was an uncontrollable madman with a license to kill.  Unfortunately, Nazi officers didn’t see what they were doing as malicious or unethical – but rather a cleansing of the population.  And, once again, Spielberg carries out this daunting portrayal with exasperating perfection.<br /><br />War films are notorious for getting it wrong.  For examples, look no further than Pearl Harbor or The Patriot – two films that cared more about the historical backdrop than telling a true story.  Obviously, those two particular films came way after the release of the critically-acclaimed story of Oskar Schindler (showing how backwards film-making has gone).  One of the many reasons this is such a widely praised film is the fact that Spielberg cared more about telling a true, realistic story than anything else.  The correct story always starts with the correct cinematography – and while cinematography is a technical term that doesn’t always fit into a date night review, it has to be the starting point here.  In this particular film, an effective documentary style of filming is used – not to mention in black a white, both of which would be correct to their time period had this film been shot in the early 1940s.<br /><br />The Nazi camps had to be recreated for the film, but they were done in close proximity to the originals with the majority of filming taking place where the actual, real-life events took place.  These camps give viewers a small taste of the absurd, malicious conditions that the Nazis forced their captives to endure until the end of the war – assuming they survived that long.  Not only did Spielberg succeed in bringing these work camps to life on the big screen, he also gives a very real depiction of the Nazi officers – who were allowed a great deal of leeway to eliminate Jews as they saw fit.  If a Jew rested for a moment while they were supposed to be working, they were quickly executed with prejudice.<br /><br />Schindler’s List is a film that can’t be praised enough and there’s very little doubt this is a film that deserves to be written about extensively – not via a short film review.  Regardless, this film - along with Saving Private Ryan, are collectively Steven Spielberg’s finest directing achievements and honor those that were lost in World War II&#62;<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  A<br />FNDNrevew.comical backdrop than telling a true story.

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book gives a great emphasis on adopting important agreements that will lead to a personal heaven on Earth. This book is a must read for those that seek to better the quality of their lives! It's hard to break old agreements you've made with yourself and this book shows you how to get out of personal hell and to enter into a blissful state of happiness and love for yourself and others.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story kept you thinking and developed the characters accordingly. After reading the the crime scene, I was suspecting something different to come out of the police report. I was disappointed with the ending of the story- but by 50% of the book I had a hard time putting the book down.
B0002BO05S|5.0|This is a story that all must watch. We need to remember why we are here..this just maybe the truth others need!

0375805613|5.0|my favorite book from childhood - a must have for every home library regardless of gender or parenting style :-)
0783227434|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this forgotten horror-comedy. This movie was produced and screened before the pre-Internet Age (1993). It was well directed, if set according to the standards of those days. This story is about a man's adventures in a magickal realm and how he becomes a hero in that time.<br /><br />One message in this movie can be read as:<br /><br />If you find true love in another realm, stay there, don't come back to this wretched earthly realm!

1595827684|5.0|If you love Mass Effect, you will surely be happy you bought this.<br />Pages 9-59 are Mass Effect<br />Pages 60-129 are Mass Effect 2<br />Pages 130-183 are Mass Effect 3<br /><br />Image to text ratio is about 90/10.  Images range from pencil, pen, paintings, 3D models, and representations of the game. There's a huge variety and not just game assets but stuff that is stylized like a comic book or a lithographic print. I'm really entertained by this book and totally satisfied. If you can't get enough of Mass Effect, this book is for you.

0307719219|5.0|This extensive analytical history would be a credit to six authors. For two it's a master piece. Centering on the idea that it is the application of inclusive political and economic institutions, not geography or climate, that is the key to a nation's growth and prosperity. The plethora of historical examples constitutes the primary attraction of the book.<br /><br />Political institutions beyond polling are not well explained. As an economical institutions banking is very lightly touched as are social institutions like education. The reader is pretty much left to gauge meaning out of context. A&R point out that politics allows the establishment of institutions and that growth can occur under exclusive institutions, or even totalitarian rule, but is not sustainable. Political institutions determine what economic institutions a nation establishes. The don't expand their theme to predict the future of the current credit based expansion in the USA.<br /><br />It's a well written, very original, analysis claiming that institutions, not geography, culture [or policy] that determines a nation's economic fate. There is no general definition of what is meant by \\"institutions'. Besides the obvious, the reader is left to decipher the many specific examples. They reference Jared Diamond geographic reasons not extended to modern world and claim Max Weber's culture hypothesis is superseded by these ideas. Example's start with the contrast between neighboring Nogales, Sonora and Nogales Texas.<br /><br />It covers a time range back to the 9500 BC Natufian culture in the ME to modern nations around the globe. It covers Spanish and Roman strategies Mexico, Ghana, the contrast between N. and S. Korea, Japan and many others. A&R describe how medieval Venice slowly constrained ducal power to maintain preeminent military and economic power for 1,000 years.<br /><br />There are intriguing ideas like vicious circle of extractive political institutions enhancing extractive economics institutions and vice-versa. There are many examples of what A and R call 'The the Iron Law of Oligarchy.\\"<br /><br />A&R show the institution slavery reducing labor productivity by inhibiting labor saving development in the antebellum South, making the S economically inferior to the N. They describe how exclusive institutions can make for significant growth unsustainable and reach limits before the inevitable decline. One interesting example is the history showing the Oye and Asante slave state expansions to be unsustainable. They cover South Africa and Apartheid. There are many other examples.<br /><br />Besides the familiar reviews of English, French and Russian histories, A&R write<br />impressive detail on unfamiliar histories like Ethiopia. In Australia, transport of convicts lead to \\"squatocracy' followed by expansion of the sheep and wool industries and public benefits of gold discovery. China is covered including the development of Deng and his struggles with Mao and the the Gang of Four. [Ironically, it appears that The USA would be better of without economic competition from China if China had adhered more to communist ideology.] Especially interesting are the differences between Botswana and her sub Saharan neighbors like Zimbabwe.<br /><br />A&R describe how Brazilian wealth declined in the twentieth century. due to government mismanagement. as well as Argentina's spotty up and down record. Negative examples include Sierra Leone, Somalia, Liberia, Columbia and Uzbekistan and Egypt. They describe how events in Iraq disappointed the possibility of developing democratic institutions and health care in India was botched. There's little analysis of the effects of Muslim or Hindu cultures.<br /><br />For sociology and politics they cover the Chartists, Grangers, and 20th century progressive movement. A&R provide a good summary of their theory based on two ideas: distinction between inclusive and extractive institutions and why inclusive institutions have been installed in some parts of the world and not others. They say historical determinism is inadequate. We can't engineer prosperity. They give examples of the failure of foreign aid efforts.<br /><br />More valuable for history than sociology, this book is such a good and extensive read that it will be very hard to give the next one a five star rating.
6304806434|5.0|Liked this one for the actors in it alone.  Great quality product.  Delivery date made on time.  Well packaged. If you like action movies this is the one.
0143119680|5.0|When I initially finished this book, I forgot that it was part of a trilogy.  I was so upset that was how the book ended, but now I need to get the next one as soon as possible.  You won't be able to put this set down.

B0013TTLDE|4.0|I read this book after reading some of Kate Morton's later books.  I totally enjoyed it and had a hard time putting it down.  Especially near the end and when I knew the \\"secret\\" was going to finally be revealed.<br /><br />If you like stories that have love, intrigue, drama and sadness all told as a sweeping epic of the old days in England, you will love this book.  Kate Morton did a wonderful job of taking you through the story with Grace, the main character, who happens to be a 98 year old woman, while she tells her life story to a young movie director. I plan to read all of Morton's books.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|First off you know that the book is always better than the movie.  I feel they left out several key points in the movie.  But regardless it was still a great movie! Seller was quick and timely, and I am overall happy with my purchase!

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Electric blues fans--run, don't walk, to pick this up. This is the best blues CD I've heard in 10 years. I'm talking \\"scream back at the guitar leads\\" good. Everything- the play list, sound engineering and musicians- is pristine.  It even includes a jazz groove on certain tracks, making the cuts diverse and the overall album more appealing. Without a doubt, the Hendrix family was able to pick from a variety of new sources to come up with a selection this solid and a posthumous collection this good. Six stars (out of five).
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Absolutely one of the best shows ever put on by PBS.<br />The acting is suberb, the British are amazing actors.<br />The story is beautiful-- the weaving in of the staff and the residents is totally magical.<br />I cannot wait til season 4 begins.<br />Get the entire series it is truly worth every penny.

B000O1799U|5.0|This was a great buy! This is one of my favorite movies, and I received the product on time. Thanks for the experience!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Just finished watching the series and find myself, like most other fans, lamenting the short sighted producers who cancelled it before it could reach it's true potential.  My only regret about viewing this series is that there will not be more coming!  A must watch for any true sci-fi fan.
B001P3SA94|5.0|This was a great buy! This is one of my favorite movies, and I received the product on time. Thanks for the experience!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Well written and an easy read.  Easy to relay  personal experiences.  Writer is a little pompous but overall highly recommended
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|The story line rocked. I loved the actors. It was a great movie and I would watch it again. Wish I would of watched it in HD.
1449410243|3.0|Some of the jokes are not child appropriate.  I had intended it for the entire family.<br />Also, it has jokes that may be considered homophobic and may not go well with gays.
B00AODKSAA|2.0|It was okay. Kind of a corny movie. I mean if you are into that kind of movie you will like it.
B00BFUC8RC|3.0|I thought the first 20 reviews were fake, but since it was a free download, I thought I'd try it. And I liked it! The first 10 minutes, I would have given it five stars. The game is fun. HOWEVER, here's what I don't like about it. You can't see the path of the roller coaster ahead of time so you know when to let go and when to hold back, so you have to play it again. There are constant reminders to purchase coins. You can build up your own coin collection, but you have to play the same game over and over again to do so. On my Kindle Fire, each time I move forward, it takes awhile to load.  Twice it locked up, and the second time, it locked up good. I tried to turn it off when it locked, but it wouldn't even turn off.  I had to reboot my KF. Scares me - I deleted the app.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|I reread this book on the Kindle recently after having read it as a papaerback in the mid-2000s and it was like a religious experience. Keep in mind in the mean time I converted faiths in real-life and many of the questions about the nature of the divine raised philosophical thoughts I enjoyed considering. People who enjoy big-picture religious thinking with a grain of humor will enjoy this. Also, a must read for Neo-Pagans. (The part about Easter &#34;feasting&#34; in New Orleans in mid-February took a few weeks to sink in.)<br /><br />For what it's worth re-reading this book around 2008 is what nudged me toward my beliefs today with no little part due to the &#34;one-eyed con-man&#34; of &#34;Mr. Wednesday.&#34;
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once you've bought this for &#34;instant Viewing&#34;. Log into Amazon, put your cursor over the Hello, (Your Name Here) Your Account and a drop down box opens, follow it down to and click on &#34;Your Video Library&#34; There it will be... easy to get to, great resolution, and it is WITHOUT commercials.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|If you don't be patient and go through the quests ,you will spend all your dollars and you want to hold onto them for as long as possible. If you spend them to speed up processes or research you will be forced to buy them down the road. Great game, just play smart.<br />Dinosaurs start as babies and grow over time. Very realistic.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Great story. Very engaging and had me hooked from the start. I remember this novel fondly, racing to find out what happened. It also came across as a well researched hard science-fiction novel, although admittedly I had to take the facts at face value since I'm not a scientist. I recommend.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love, love, LOVE it! Will definitely read again... I miss Fifty already... It has everything in a book to keep you wanting more!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Glad it was free.  Downloaded it but the game either hit Force Stop or crashed each time I tried to start it.  Removed it immediately.  Totally dissapointed.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Epic. Amazing acting. Nolan is a visionary. He's a great artist in his field. This is one of the best movies i've seen. Can't wait to see what is coming next from nolan
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Only through first for tracks and these arrangements, Band of Gypsy style with Jimi backed with bass & drums just kill.  It's like straight whiskey, versus the confusion of an elaborate cocktail...goes straight to the heart of the matter.<br /><br />His solos are just fantastic on the first few takes, worth the price of admission...especially the wah wah work on &#34;Somewhere&#34;.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It will make you cry. You will also be on the edge of your seat, not being able to put the book down. A great ending to a great story.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|There really didn't seem to be a point to the book until the end...the very end.  There was nothing really surprising or different about the story that would have me wanting to read about his next 3 years in highschool .  My friend and I were reading it as part of a book club and we would ask each other &#34;what part are you up to?&#34;, neither could pin point a reference.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|its a great app and easy to use.simple function and have complete help.now you can edit your photoes like the way you want.don't have to spend your money and time to tell someone how you want to do it.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Made a great Christmas gift in addition to some creamsicle fudge. Movie and fudge night! The movie came on time and worked well with no problems.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Definitely a must read for anyone interested in the afterlife or N.D.E.'s. Dr. Eben's story is very heartfelt & credible, especially with his background as a neurosurgeon. I do recommend this book.
B004EPZ02A|5.0|This arrived in super time and packaging was superb.  This like the other two are great!!! We love these type of movies.  We love to be scared and see these type of movies especially around Halloween.  Very entertaining!!!<br />Would recommend this movie for a great fun evening at home!!!  Great company to do business with...
B003EY7IRC|4.0|Loved the raw sexual tension in these characters. A great roller coaster ride that i would get in line for again and again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book as with the other two are excellent.  Cannot put down once I start to read.  That says so much for me as I like to read but when it gets my interest!!!  Must be GREAT!!!!!!  Wish they would keep making more to follow this book I want to keep reading them... LOVE ... LOVE .... LOVE this .... Excellent story!!!!!
B008Q0D32S|5.0|Wow!  Don't remember ever seeing this movie. Enjoyed it a lot!  Great acting! I highly recommend this movie! You will too!
B00000I2PG|5.0|I loved this band and this album in the early 80's and still enjoy it in 2013 more often than most other albums! Just great!!! Enjoy it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book it was interesting and always kept me in suspense. This is why I rated it a five. I just wished there was a little more to read such as when they got married after everything.
B003INBOEM|3.0|Setting up for audio and subtitles is difficult, as it keeps on getting back to the default set-up and no Mandarin subtitles!
B0007TKNII|5.0|This movie is amazing period.<br />It was shipped on time and in great condition.<br />This is a great movie to watch.<br />I dont know what else i can say besides its great
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|It is hard to be more human than what is portrayed in this movie. It makes you feel optimistic about being alive. Some of the early sex scenes are a bit awkward but the emotion so overwhelms the physical aspects that any uncomfortable feelings quickly evaporate. This movie may not be everyone but if you have a heart you will love it. More depth and way better than Argo - and I felt closer to the characters than in Lincoln - both good movies but this one is special - the only movie that I liked as much in the past year was Monsieur Lazhar
0375826742|5.0|No complaints can be given for this book. Especially since I love the series<br />The book came amazingly well packaged<br />Also came in on the date that I thought it would
B00030590I|5.0|THIS DVD HAS VERY GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS!!!<br /><br />VERY GOOD STORY LINE!!!<br />ALL ACTORS ARE VERY GOOD!!!<br />LOVE STORY!!!<br /><br />A DVD MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION!!!
B008K8VDPU|2.0|I really liked this game but when i did the update it got rid of all of my songs\hq instruments that i payed over 5 dollars for so please refund me or like give ne back my stuff please
B0083SBMBM|5.0|THIS DVD IS AN EXCELLENT DVD,<br />EXCELLENT SPECIAL EFFECT,<br />EXCELLENT STORY LINE,<br />EXCELLENT ACTORS,<br /><br />A DVD MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|SIMILAR TO TEMPLE RUN BUT BETTER GRAPHICS AND IS APPROPRIATE FOR ALL DIFFERENT AGES; VARYING COLORS AND LEVELS ARE GREAT
076115678X|4.0|I had no idea how to properly care for curly hair, and this book explains it all!  Styling tips, too!  My curls have never looked better.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was amazing I give it a 5 out 5 I loved it everyone should read this book Its really good
B008OOYALE|5.0|A great game for every dragon fan. I give it two big thumbs up. One of the best games I have played
B007WPM4P0|4.0|this was an excellent movie. the acotrs were spot on, it was a real tear jerker, i would recomend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a really good game an  I recommend it for any one at a age of 6  to 15 an  I'm not going to exaggerate but this app is on  of the best I have ever had, now please take this seriously if you like this review buy the app
0307592731|5.0|I loved this book. It's a travelogue of sorts, but so much more than that. It's poignant and touching and funny and frustrating. There is so much to think about and respond to and be moved by. The author's style is compelling and easy to read and she has a marvelous knack with words and phrases. This was among the most enjoyable books I've read in a long time.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Highly recommend this book as the details that need not be known (the suicide) are not said yet the story and the point of the story gets across and makes one think about their words and actions. I would recommend this to anyone one in junior high or high school. There are many lessons to be learned here:<br /> - words hurt<br /> - think twice before you speak<br /> - help is available IF you ask for it
B00846F1YW|4.0|Interesting story line but the puzzles were a  bit easy.  Overall a good game and fine waste of my time.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Always enjoy Jones. Mary Steenburgen always delivers a good performance. Music is exceptional. Story line is a bit rough and seems to wonder a bit at times. Recommended...
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|Seems to me that it's a bit unfair to Jimi.  Had he lived,  his music would have hopefully evolved and grown.  When I hear this music resuscitated, as it is here -- as cool as it is to hear more Jimi -- I hear the same thing I heard 30+ years ago (and probably not the most inspired version of it either).  So for the Jimi purists, listen on.  This seems a bit more of an industry money maker than anything else.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I bought this for myself just as much as I did for my kids. No issues with shipping or the blu-ray disks. Top notch for some stunning visuals and educational content for the kids (who can't seem to get enough).
B0000542D2|5.0|This movie belongs in every music fans DVD collection, whether or not they are a Beatles fan.  It is hard to find a copy of this movie at a fair price, but it is worth the effort.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This caught my eye in a big way.  I am addicted now.  I can't wait for season 4.  I heard about it from a friend and had missed all 3 seasons but I caught  up right away
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|You may not understand the language but the music makes your heart soar. Andrea Bocelli has a remarkable voice and is a joy and pleasure to listen to. I hope he has more abums coming out soon!!
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Again, Josh brings us a combination of songs that will fill your heart and make you smile all day long.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|It's completely what i expected and I love it. The delivery was super fast. I love that I can read while lying down and I am a lot less nervous that I am going to drop it. Once I get it decorated with my team logo it will be complete.
B000BNI99K|5.0|Awsome set. Love the Stew......He sings a ton of older stuff and they sound great. Use at dinner parties as background music. Nice.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I love this game! I would have given it 5 stars or more, But that being said the latest update stinks.<br />Reasons:<br />1) Friends villages disappear every time you exit the game.<br />2) Dinosaurs that you had in the \\"Ice Age\\" world disappear when you purchase in \\"Dino World\\" and you lose anything you paid for them in \\"Ice Age\\".<br />3) Game play has slowed down a lot.<br />4) New \\"swipe\\" coin collecting does not work properly and there should be an option to remove it from the screen.<br />I would only recomend if they fix the bugs introduced with the lastest version.<br />I think they should also give you the option of not updating and staying or rolling back to the old version.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Food Inc. was a spectacular movie. Like an organic artichoke, it peeled back different layers of the food industry - from the treatment of animals and meat to its abusive relationships with its farmers to its influence in the government. It was truly eye-opening.<br /><br />The film educated me about the food industry but where it was most applicable was how I can apply this knowledge on a daily basis. Everyone eat three meals each day if we're lucky, and our health is highly dependent on the quality of food that we put in our bodies. After I saw this movie, I vowed to learn more about where my food comes from and eat more wholesome (most likely organic) food everyday.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Best season yet....love love love the show.  If you havent watched it you need to buy season one and watch...it is well worth it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator! its impressive in size and you can't beat that is free!!!  I only use it for basic<br />calculations and it works perfectly!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best dramas to come out in years. This series is the reason I subscribe to Amazon, in part. Keep up the good work.<br /><br />Regards, Chuck Schonert
B00B2JOJIM|4.0|gr8 remixes of their latest single 'heaven' these guys just keep on rollin! i wish the packaging was a little better but the major label want max profits min. packaging
B008OOYALE|4.0|Fun but requires patience for earning, growing and achievements if you don't want to spend money. Please fix the bug that causes the blue screen. I had to buy something three times because it would blue screen as I was trying to place my farm. farm To get out of the blue screen I have to visit a friend. Amazing game but could be better if earning was easier and if the glitches were resolved.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Read out loud to 9 year old. He says, &#34;it is very awesome, great book and highly recommends it.&#34;<br />Mom says, &#34;great look back in time. The language and attitude adjusted a bit for appropriateness. Found new &#34;old&#34; words to define. It was fun reading with old southern voices too ;)
B005NS5CX4|5.0|Lady Antebellum is a great Country group!  If you aren't familiar with them, they are 3 very talented musicians, song-writers and artists.<br /><br />We have seen Lady A in concert a few times and they do not disappoint.  There is not much difference in the vocal qualities in person and on a recording!  They are true to form!
B0024RI72U|5.0|This is hands down my favorite Album. Every song on it is a masterpiece, inspired by the tales of the Silmarillion. I would recommend reading the Silmarillion and then listening to this Album, it means so much more once you know the tales!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|The movie was not what I expected from a Bond movie. There was less gadgets used in the movie. Daniel Craig does a great acting job as James Bond. Can't wait until the next Bond movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was just as great as the first one. The suspense of what would happen next and if they would still be together.
B0095P29EG|5.0|Thor is just what the doctor ordered if you need a good dose of superheroes, sibling rivalry, wormholes, and smart lady scientists.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I would recommend these books to anyone who is willing to take the time and enjoy reading. This is a great suspense and romantic novel that in some ways this could be happening some where.
B00AJLHUYO|1.0|The first 1 1/2 hours of this movie you'll spend watching this scuzzy True Crime writer with a drinking problem spend his days getting henpecked by his wife (who has a British accent cause YOLO), and his nights watching a stack of snuff films he finds in the attic of his new house. Then he stumbles around his house in the small hours of the morning jumping at scary sounds but for some reason he never turns on a light. EVER. This whole movie looks like it was lit by a book light. Seriously - it's SO dark it takes all the scare out of it because all you see is his big sweaty face peering around corners.<br /><br />It never gets off the ground, either. Yeah, his house is haunted, but the haunting never escalates. They just stay going BUMP in the night. Remember the scene in trailers where the boy crawls backwards out of the box? Yeah, that's like the ONLY incident that's halfway creepy and it happens really early on in the movie too (you get the feeling they put that scene in just to have something interesting to put in the trailers). If anything, the haunting gets less scary as the story progresses.<br /><br />In the last 30 min of the film he gets spooked out mostly by his own moral depravity and decides to take his family and move in the middle of the night back to their real home, a huge mansion in the country you see all of 2 minutes of before the \\"surprise\\" ending of the film when a demonic child-eating Lucha Libre wrestler shows up and... Well, I'm sure you'll have guessed about half way through the film how it's going to end anyway.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow what an interesting book. When I started reading this I couldn't put it down, I just wanted to keep reading. This is for the true love of a book reader.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I read the first book because my boyfriends mom gave me her kindle and it was pre-loaded on it. I managed to finish the first book, and decided to try the second because 'why not?'. yuck. This book is horrible and the lead character is pretty much a disgrace to women.
B00992CF6W|4.0|While the app was an incredible addition to my amazon cloud it wasn't nearly as fun as the computer or xbox editions. Like the fact that there is no use for redstone plus there is nether along with the fact that it is impossible to light tnt in creative .  But that is the only negative things I found. Besides that it was super fun.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love the Game of Thrones series and I am currently up to book # 5. I have never been interested in 'fantasy series' before but I am having a great time reading these books. The series on HBO is awesome and I am definitely a fan.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I've already purchased (die trying Jack Reacher No. 2) My opinion of killing floor is (was) a good portion of the book just seemed to ramble on & on. Some of the character's that were in and out of the book  seemed to have very little<br />use within the plot of the story. The better part of the book was at last, the very end chapter. All in all, I really had a hard time holding my interest in the story line. If die trying, after the first, (say) 8 or 10 chapters, as I said, rambles<br />on, I will not attempt to read the entire book, delete it from my kindle, and say goodbye to Lee Childs. I am waiting for any new e-books by Brad Thor and / or Vince Flynn who in my humble opinion are excellent writers!  I have read all of Thor's and Flynn's recent books,I believe about 20 between them, and all hold you,chapter to chapter right to the end page!! great writers. Thank you for this opportunity to vent my feelings and opinion!
B004EPZ03O|5.0|I love this movie. I saw it in theaters and laughed and cried! Jason Segal did a great job and I think this Muppet movie is my favorite one yet.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game. Not a lot of waiting around like many horse gams. Downside is the gems arnt easy to get.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love the Game of Thrones series and I am currently up to book # 5. I have never been interested in 'fantasy series' before but I am having a great time reading these books. The series on HBO is awesome and I am definitely a fan.
1439190275|5.0|this really worked for me,i was amazed within 1 week i lost 8 lbs i would tell my friends about the new atkins
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is by far the best book in the Game of Thrones series. Obviously I cannot say much and spoil to those who are interested in reading the book or seeing the upcoming premier on HBO. This is an amazing series and I have never been into any fantasy series in the past but I am having a lot of fun reading them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's so cool there was Rio, new York, now there's Rome so cool. I played like every day
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I love this movie and I am really happy to have purchased it. The Beatles are my favorite; and to have a story with Beatles songs is pretty interesting and unique. It is a musical, so definitely prepare for that. It is not just a love story, it is a story of much more. I recommend to any Beatles fans or just fans or musicals or cover songs in general.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This starts out like most of the Lincoln Lawyer Books.  He takes a case and tries to prove his client didn't do it. He has to do a lot of research to prove she didn't do it.  There are many surprised thru out the story line. At the end he isn't sure he can get her off....he knows he can't win them all
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love the Game of Thrones series and I am currently up to book # 5. I have never been interested in 'fantasy series' before but I am having a great time reading these books. The series on HBO is awesome and I am definitely a fan.
B008LY9AWG|2.0|Mulholland Dive was the best of the three stories that were in this book.  Mulholland I would give a **** too.  The rest of the story lines were confusing and out of focus therefore I only gave the book **
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Atlases cloud was one of those books that you say \\"man it was a really good book but boy was it a hard read.\\" David Mitchell is obviously a great wordsmith. But tiding all of the books together was very hard for me. But I am 66 And I have a neuropathy which requires me to take pain meds that make me a little fuzzy. Consequently I had a hard time following such a Convoluted story. Having said that I would recommend this book because it is so fantastical.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|I found this story line very interesting. Michael Connelly is one of today great writers.  You wont be sorry if you chose this book.
0345803485|1.0|I decided to read this book to see what all the hype was all about, and I am completely shocked at how utterly childish this book is. The grammar and diction are horrendous and there are so many repetitions, I am completely shocked as to how this book or series has gotten published.  The relationship between Ana and Christian is beyond demeaning, and the way Ana is portrayed is a disgrace and condescending to all women. I would give this book a negative, but I had to give it 1 star to write a review.  This book and series is a complete waste of time and utter  trash!!!! E.L. James should be ashamed of herself for writing a disgusting book.  I could not even push myself to finish the book. Only read halfway through before I was thoroughly sick of the plot and writing!!!  DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT READ OR BUY THIS BOOK!! YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is pretty accurate. Of course the weather is unpredictable so it may be a tad off but it's right most of the time. I had it on my iPod and liked it so much I got it for my kindle too.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this show. I actually bought my season one for $5 more from a FYE store. It was a random purchase, I don't know what made me purchase it other that the fact that it was on &#34;sale&#34; but I'm glad I did cause I loved it. I watched the whole season in about a week and just ordered season 2 and 3. I can't wait!
0307719774|5.0|This question a day is fun.  It will be even more so when I can look back each year and see what I wrote previously.  I recommend this book highly.
B0086AYAQ6|3.0|I appreciated the quality of the performance on this recording but I don't think there is anyone from the Albert Hall listening and no audience response.  Some of this material has been recorded so many times, I've lost interest.  I have seen Valentina playing live and it was stunning.  I am sure she has better recordings than this with better repertoire.  I will keep searching.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great minigames!<br />Good search games. Like the features that tell you how well you are doing on a minigame. The map is helpful.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|A great laugh from beginning through most of the book.  I enjoyed the adventure after he escaped from the nursing home more than his travels. We know it is fiction but the massive coincidences including creating the atom bomb and meeting all the heads of state became boring...........but still a great read.<br /><br />Judy P
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|This app is ok, it's fun, but I don't spend a lot of time on it. You draw your own stick person, then it becomes animated as you move it through the stick figure world.  It's cute, and I will keep it and play with it every now and then.
B009A882D0|5.0|This is music I listened to growing up, enjoyed and if I had any of the albums have lost them through moving or other life altering  experiences. I am glad to have the music back in my life.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My son who is ten years old and I love this game so very much.  It is just like being part of the movies.
B008C20TDG|4.0|Stripping your diet back to safe foods. Observing the results on your body. Adding less safe foods and watching the impact. Simple ideas well presented. In my case I have blood pressure issues. I am following the suggestions in this book to see if changing my eating habits can have an affect.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants help making a start down the path to better health.
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|I grew up watching the A-Team, and so when the movie came out I was kind of skeptical. I waited until this year to watch it, and it was worth watching. Great summary for the beginning of the story, nice effects, even a special guest appearance :). This is NOT a family friendly version, but overall, was a fun movie.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's fun but loads really slow. It's good for people that like to search for stuff. I love this freaking game.
B000085RPU|1.0|This dvd is.Region 2 not Region 1  disk so i cant even play it on my xbox360 system and when i play it on my laptop it is scratch it freezes
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great series so sad it's over. A must read! Didn't thinh would of survived. Glad she was with peeta
B009FZHYKU|5.0|With the plethora of zombie apocalypse movies and series out, this gripping serial drama stands above the rest. Serialized TV series is a trend that I like because the characters are &#34;fleshed out&#34; more fully. (No pun intended!) Walking Dead is mesmerizing and keeps you on your toes as you witness both the strengths and weaknesses of each character as he or she grows an develops against difficult odds.The characters are not all good or all evil, but different personalities trying to survive in a world gone mad. Caution: I would not watch this series with anyone younger than 14, because of the violence and gore. I give this series 5 stars. I hope it maintains its good story lines.
B0081336FO|5.0|The production values and acting are excellent, as we expect from a BBC production. Martin Freeman's good work in the role as Watson makes the characters more approachable. Episodes are a bit long at 90 to 120 minutes, so it may take more then one evening to get through an episode.<br /><br />This was the first series I've watched using the Amazon video service, and the experience was very good. I have relatively fast DSL (~5 MB/s), and didn't experience any buffer issues or glitches while watching the  videos. While the Video quality wasn't quite Blu-ray, it was quite acceptable on a large screen HDTV.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Can not do any thing with out adobe reader ever write this review about adobe reader. Easy veiwing of material that is to be read.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|The quality of the online viewing is interuppted with delays and stalls.  Neither of these problems are experienced from other media when i use their online viewing.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|If you love Bowie, if you love Muppets/Jim Henson, or if you never wanted to grow up, you should own this movie.<br /><br />You wont be disappointed, it's awesome.
B005LAIGF0|1.0|If you enjoy listening to several females screaming at each other for over 2 hrs don't miss this movie; if not then don't waste your time. Had there been anything else on I would never have watched it all.

B00368PSN2|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen that nobody has heard of. It's definitely a sci-fi staple in my collection.
1935597760|4.0|This book was a great read!  I really liked the author's way of describing things... she made it very easy to picture yourself there in the book.  This is a great book to curl up on the couch with and lose yourself in.  Ms. McKenna does have such a unique way with words and paints her characters in vivid detail.  I really enjoyed this book and am recommending it to my mother.  I would definitely like to read anything else she's penned!
B0000696I0|5.0|My son loved this cartoon, I recommend it to you all have fund watching it and party on dudes , yeah
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This is a very amazing advanced calculator with 8 different layouts for all types of problems. Anything from simple math to the most advanced stuff like calculus. It's a great app that can come in handy for anyone. Hope you try it out. [...] Thanks

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I loved this book. It is still to see if I succed my self.<br />John is a fluent and easy going writer. he sets a good example
1593078684|2.0|I order this  for one of my friend's birthday when it said it was in stock still.<br />When it finally got to my friend's house, she said she got a Quantum Mechanics Math Book instead.<br />She returned the book, and I spoke to the sellers, and they said they were out of stock on it.<br />Wrong book, but it did ship fast.<br /><br />Oh well. :( Really wanted to get it.
B004BGJYOW|5.0|Anytime I need to get in a better mood I listen to this CD. You can laugh, you can cry and best of all you can sing along as loud as you want!
0345534379|1.0|Tiny size (yes, I know I should have measured it first)<br /><br />Even smaller text (impossible to read)<br /><br />Very few illustrations, and all in boring b/w.<br /><br />My son didnt even open it, I should have paid more and gotten the larger 4 color book.
B00005NGAL|5.0|The poems by T.S.Eliot are amazing to begin with. Put them to music and dance and you've got something simply remarkable to watch. I love this performance so much I started naming my own cats after the characters.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Great book! It kept me wanting more. Can't wait to read the next one. Clarke was a science fiction genius.
B00110K62U|5.0|I've heard a few other performances of this production but this one takes the cake! The gigantic choir on stage the whole time just adds to it.
0316077046|5.0|i give this a 5+stars one the book was ordered on the 6th and was expected to arrive no earlier than the 12th yet it arrived one day early.<br /><br />i had previously ordered the book and did not recieve it as such i was discouraged but after the prompt service i will be ordering my books strictly through this company.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I don't remember the first time I ever saw this movie, but I never get tired of watching it. This one is a big part of what made me want to dance as a little girl.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|One of the best shows on tv similar to \\"lost\\" but better more focus on the science not the emotions
1592407889|3.0|I read Sachi Parker's Lucky Me book but left feeling that she was a rather bitter and spoiled person, kind of shallow seeking entitlements from her mom.  I simply did not feel that sorry for her because we all have to make a way in this world and I think she wrote the book to get back at her mother for not supporting her acting career.  She wanted to ride on the coattails of her mom, and her mom said &#34;no!&#34;  I can understand her hurt, but she blames everyone in her life for her problems.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really enjoy giving and receiving items from friends that help in progressing in the game.  I like trying to complete all the collections and getting the artifacts.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Great CD! There is usually a song or two that i will skip right through; however, every song on this disc is great!
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|It's a simple and easy game. It can get a little boring but it's long enough that you're getting your money's worth if you paid for it. I got it for free so it's definitely worth it for me. It's intriguing enough to want to finish it through to the end.
B00573YVVY|5.0|Fiction could not imagine a story like Obama's<br />This is not the life of a man created by minders. It has an authenticity that is so rare in this media driven world.<br />It restores ones hope .
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is a great book it is very sad to see that he has passed. He took his final mission of helping other vets affected by war and was doing his best until the day he died which is all anyone can ask from a soldier.
0395389496|5.0|Imagine finding out that my 5 year granddaughter didn't know this story!  I ordered it just a few days before Christmas and it quickly arrived, so I could share it with her on Christmas Eve.  She wasn't immediately interested in spite of the fact that I had hidden a bell on the Christmas tree for her to find.  No matter because I know in years to come, she will grow to love the beautiful illustrations and the mysterious quality of the text.  It is a treasure of a lifetime.
B004FGMDOQ|1.0|Cant believe this was a best seller.....kept reading it hoping something better was going to happen......it didnt.....very disappointed...........dont buy it.......
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|very good game, some breeds r tuft to get but otherwise, fantastic app! it is a big download, but still it is totally worth the space I rated this 4 stars because I don't like in-app purchases. but still this game is Dynamite!
B00992CF6W|5.0|We need more items because this game is kinda getting boring we need more stuff in creative mode like gold diamond and lots more mostly Redstone
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I've been a fan of Tegan & Sarah for quite some time and this is a nice change to their normally folkish, acoustic rock music. I listen to the whole thing all the way through.
B008XG1X18|4.0|love to check in and see all the new posting . re-pin what i like . just wish i could figure out how to find some of the products that i see. :  (
B00AREIAI8|2.0|you have to buy everything... ads ads ads ads ads!!! If there was a version to buy I'd have given it 5 stars easy.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|So this is the second part of Fifty Shades. Ok so this book gets boring by the middle way but then it goes back to fun after it.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|This case has a simple design, high quality, great protection and affordable price.  I love Timbuk2 bags and this case is consistent with their quality and durability.  Very satisfied.
B0091REZMW|3.0|You have to invite friends to play to get anywhere.  Diamonds are frustrating to get and it takes forever to get.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book surpassed all of my expectations! I can't wait for more books to come! True love lasts no matter the circumstances!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have to say how much I have enjoyed this app!!  I think that this app is way better than the &quot;brain training&quot; games.  This was more of a workout and it made you want to keep coming back for more....
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I felt like in the first one the character would just jump or not turn when you tried to get him to.  It doesn't happen as much in this one.  I like the setting and obstacles better too.
B00866JL96|5.0|Having read all of Nicholas Sparks books, this is another great movie of his book.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It is actually a little like owning a real horse. I kind of wish you could train your horse to do anything you want.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really good app, my sister loves playing with the horse! Has been quite afew pop ups though recently which is abit annoying..
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing .. MuSt read! Couldn't put this amazing book down. GreAt beginning, keeps your attention middle, and hearts retching end!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I love that fact that you get an inside look of his story. Very detailed and informative which makes it an easy read to get through. Anthony's great personality is definitely apparent in this book, which I love!
B00006JIA4|5.0|I just loved Queen as they wrote and played their music, and over the years my collection got separated and transfered to cassette and then it was just not in the right format.... I needed it all on CD!  So I bought it all and now I have it all, right at my finger tips..!  It is magical and wonderful and I love it and so will you... do not hesitate one moment , buy and love it too. Freddie lives on in this amazing compilation of their best music.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's the most awesome game I've ever played!!!! Though I wish that it was easier to get gems.great game all in all, it has it's quirks, and gets a little glitchy sometimes.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is amazing! A great love story about a bad boy! A real page turner! Couldn't put it down!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Pretty good book. It was an up and down story and you didn't know how it was going to end. I'll suggest this book to everyone. Now I just want to see the movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great mystery.  I've played an older version of this game and this one peeks my interest because of the characters. I recommend this to hidden object enthusiasts and mystery buffs.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I've downloaded a few calculators but haven't found a really good one. One that you would expect to find on a smartphone. But this one is the best one I've seen so far! It does a load of calculations, including scientific, financial, hexadecimal, date & time calculations, length, area, volume, and more! The only thing this doesn't seem to do is graphing... something that would be helpful in school but I don't find I really need that in real life. This is, by far, my favorite calculator and will be my go-to app when needing to do math.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|beautifully done and way fun. I don't usually get addicted to games but this one I cant put it down
B000J10ERO|5.0|I was surprised that the public did not react well to this movie, Superman is a cultural icon and an institution.  This did not reak of the political message and weakness of the ill fated Superman IV, and it did not have the camp comedy of Superman III.  With that being said, this was a truly wonderful movie for children as well as adults.  Why didn't it make such an impact?  There were a couple of reasons maybe.<br /><br />Forgoing Superman III and IV, this movie continued where Superman II left off.  Superman left the earth in a futile search.  Scientists thought that they had found his long lost home planet of Krypton, and he has, like the title says, returned after a five year absence.  Assuming his alter ego of Clark Kent, he returns to his old job at the Daily Planet to find that the world has moved on.  Lois Lane, his love, has moved on.  She is engaged to be married to Perry White's son Richard and they have a young son.  She even won a Pulitzer Prize for her piece, \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman\\", much to his chagrin.  And yes, there was a HUGE hole in this.  If we were to forget Superman III and IV, we were also to forget the fact that at the end of Superman II he gave her that magic kiss where she forgot that she knew his true identity, but she left her pregnant with his child.  And - SPOILER ALERT - when this movie begins, she knows that her son is actually Superman's but still doesn't know that Superman is actually Clark Kent.  And it just so happens that Lex Luthor (played with all the panache of a wonderful, delightful Kevin Spacey - who brings the right amount of evil and humor to this role) has also returned with one of his infamous plots to overtake the world.<br /><br />Why didn't this movie fly?  The obvious references to Superman being a Jesus figure are there, but then again it is a metaphor for the Holy Trinity - Jor-El is the father, Clark Kent is the son, Superman is the Holy Spirit who protects us.  It was ALWAYS like that, it was notcreated just for this movie.  Kate Botsworth as Lois Lane looks a bit too young to have had such a history with Superman nor anyone else.  And Brandon Routh?  Many said he was lousy, but he was a wonderful Superman.  Was he too stiff?  Not really, he was just right.  Not perfect, but he was wonderful as Superman, having to once again rescue all of us from all the horrible things that we can and can't do to each other.  Because the world needs a savior, and he is our savior.  Superman is the best of who we are, who shows us that we are all heroes, all a great people who can make the world a better place.  Embrace him as much as we must embrace each other.
0439023513|3.0|Obviously I read this book after The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, and those books were simply page turners ... I loved LOVED the first book in the series, I thoroughly enjoyed the second book but this one, I put it down 3 times to read other books in between ... I went back to it only because I had to know what happens and I wanted to know whom Katniss picks, even though I was getting really impatient with her unknowing heart but given the pressure and circumstances of her life, I cut her some slack :)!<br /><br />I felt that it started out strong and Katniss showed some serious hope and depth in terms of her character and what she wanted and how she was not going to compromise, but then it became a little boring, the characters in District 13 were not very interesting and the absence of Peeta, as another reviewer carefully mentioned, took away that balance - that harmony - that common sense side of Katniss. Leaving Peeta largely out of the story forced us to focus solely on Katniss and her dark world, and I also wish there was more of Prim. If Prim was the one and only thing that Katniss lived for - besides Peeta although she figures this out later - then why could we not get to know Prim more?<br /><br />I am almost sad to admit just how impatiently I was reading the book, just to read it, not to enjoy it. I was almost sick of Katniss and the whole war between the capital and the districts, and the ending just petered out. There was no true peace or happiness for Katniss after all, thanks to taking Prim away and I do understand it was a necessary part of the story - but I wish it had been her mother or maybe her \\"cousin\\" Gale who got the ax and not little Prim.<br /><br />Also I do wish there was a clarity as to what in the world had happened behind the scenes between President Snow and Coin but no explanation.<br /><br />I am glad I read the whole series, and I appreciate Suzanne Collins's amazing writing style and story telling. I just think this one came up short. That's all! Here's hoping the next series of books she gives us makes up for it :)!short. That's all! Here's hoping the next series of books she gives us makes up for it :)!
1401923127|5.0|It's time I read it again. Such a deep book that a refresher is in order to fully comprehend and implement such dynamic and radical ideas.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I have to admit i never saw the movies when they first came out nor very soon after either.  I bought htis so I could finaly watch them.  And this set didnt disapoint.  The product is inexpensive for some great movies.  Each disc also has some special features as well.  So if oyu want all 8 movies then this set I recommend.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|This movie was a little different for me, its not a musical but it kind of looks like it, I was disappointed it was not filmed in Russia it would of look much better, but actors played great and you get use to the way it was filmed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My second time reading this and it got even better. Onto the next one! :-) I cannot hardly wait for the movies!

B005IQ16M2|1.0|This version does NOT contain the illustrations even though it says it is illustrated. (At least when read on my iPad.)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have the first one and enjoy it.  The second one is even more fun.  I love using it on my kindle.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|It is a movie not to remember, so I'm not going to dredge out the memories to write my review.<br />I have written many hundreds of reviews and nothing ever came and  hisothersclose to the morass of total badness.<br />How can others have liked it? I can't imagine. Devolution of American aesthetics? Mass hysteria;no,<br />more like mass frontal lobotomies. I like Nolan's DARK CITY and his others very much.<br /><br />Here, uniformally across the board, script, production qualities, acting all were awful. I'm going to have read other<br />reviews to see what they saw over 2 stars. And perhaps then that'll be the last time I read Amazon Reviews.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app allows you to download books to your tablet to read whenever you want. There are lots of good books that are free on amazon so you will never run out of something to read. If you like to read  then you should get this app!
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|In a nut shell Falling Skies is a post apocalyptic sci-fi drama (similar to Walking Dead for example), and as such it does a good job.  A couple of times the story has been a little predictable, but not enough to detract from the experience.  As a fan of this particular type of entertainment I enjoy the premise, the characters and back story, and where the story is headed.  I have read reviews of both positive and negative light but decided to start watching after the show was renewed up for a third season and have not been disappointed.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This  game is not just for kids but adults too. You have to really think to complete each level so it is challenging.  You have to cut the rope to get the candy to the little animal. There are different obstacles and ways to do this so it does not get boring.
B000067QMD|4.0|These lids seal up the Advent bottles perfectly, have had no leaks while using.  Be aware that these replace the nipple so you will need to carry it separately while the sealing disc is in use.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game very relaxing. Enjoy it on the screen. Like the way the flip cards are stacked. Miss the competitive self tracking feature available on iPad that measures time completed, number of moves.<br /><br />Lots of fun!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever<br />it is the best temple run game ever<br />if you buy this game good luck<br />its awesome

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love it it has good graffitis if you like temple run ur going to love this. it has a lot more stuff
1569242739|5.0|It is a very fun book with nice illustrations.  The recipes are easy to follow and it had good tips.
1439102813|4.0|This is the first book by this author that I have read and I will add her to my list of author's to read! I felt connected to Alice from the beginning and my heart broke for her, watching her mind deteriorate and watching her realize that it was happening. I was intrigued watching her progress through this and saddened by the fact that she was. The reaction by some of her family members made me angry at times. This book depicted the disease in such a way that made it real, personal, and understood. I would most definitely recommend this book.<br /><br />(Fortunately I have never had a loved one afflicted with Alzheimer's disease so I have no life-stories to compare to this book. I loaned it to a friend who experienced this first hand and her reaction to the book was that it was right on the mark.)
1592332803|5.0|It has amazing recipes, easy to follow.  I enjoyed all the vegan baking tips.  Everybody loves the recipes I've done so far.
1594744769|2.0|Looks like I'm in the minority here but I didn't like this book. I don't know exactly what I was expecting but I can tell you this was not it. What made me purchase this book was the fantastically creepy pictures throughout and I just couldn't wait to see what the story lines behind the pictures were. The main character visits an orphanage type home on an island to find these \\"peculiar\\" children there with these unrealistic abilities. I thought the plot was dull, the abilities too unbelievable, and the lack of creepiness to the story was such a let down after viewing the photos. I thought there could have been so much more creepiness and imagination to the story. I have to remind myself that this is labeled as a children's book (although I wouldn't let my 12 year olds read it because I thought there was just a tad too much mature content) and maybe that's why I was disappointed in the simplicity of the story. I don't recommend this book.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|P!nk's album \\"Funhouse\\" is one that I keep in rotation with the others in my car.  My favorite track on the album is \\"I Don't Believe You\\", a beautiful ballad about a relationship that's seen better days.  P!nk's voice is so sincere in it that the first time I heard it I couldn't help but cry.  \\"Crystal Ball\\" may have a similar effect on some people with its heartfelt lyrics and acoustic sound.  \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\" is reminiscent of \\"I Don't Believe You\\" in it's sentiment, but is a little more poppy and not as dismal.  \\"Sober\\" is probably my second favorite song on the album, speaking on P!nk's insecurities and shortcomings (a message that most of us can relate to).  Really, I love most of this album enough to only press \\"skip\\" every now and again.  \\"Glitter in the Air\\", however, is one that I skip every time.  It's just too sappy for my liking.
0743454537|5.0|I read this book years ago and recommend it to anyone I can. It is in my list of top 5 all time favorite books. Unfortunately, it was the first Jodi Picoult book I read and none of her others (and she's had some really good ones and really bad ones) have lived up to this book.<br /><br />This was the first book I can remember reading from various character's perspectives and I found it fantastically interesting. Picoult's use of various fonts to set each character apart is brilliant. I felt instantly connected to Anna - really all of the characters. The story of a little girl fighting against the will of her parents to stop being a medical supplement for her dying sister is riveting and very thought provoking. I was often pulled in all directions based on whose perspective I was reading.<br /><br />In no way will I give away the ending of the book which is by far the best ending to a book I have ever read. I literally had tears running down my face. Which leads me to my soap box and the movie of the same name - I was so mad when I left the theater and in awe that Picoult would allow the ending to be changed to the predictable ending that the movie-makers ended the movie with. Read the book - it puts the movie to shame!
B002RAREAK|4.0|Usher never disappoints me.  This album has fun dance-y tracks and slow \\"confessions\\"-esque tracks.  My favorite track is the smooth, sexy \\"Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)\\".  When this song comes on in my car, I can't drive fast enough to get home to my husband!  \\"Lil Freak\\" is another great track to put you \\"in the mood\\".  What can I say--Usher knows what sexy is and he uses this power to his advantage!  If you're a fan of his other cds, you'll love this one too.
1442419814|4.0|I had heard about this series from my niece who is a freshman in college. She didn't give much detail, but knowing my love of The Hunger Games Series, mentioned the Uglies Trilogy (I don't know why it's a trilogy when there are 4 books...). I am enthralled with young adult literature and decided to check it out. The writing style reminds me of Stephenie Meyer - easy to read, not a lot of substance. I'm not saying that's a bad thing at all - some books are better that way. As the story begins, I would have preferred more background story as to why they are living the way they are and how they got this dystopian society to work. Today's society tends to find itself focused on appearance which has quite a lot of affect on people whether we admit it or not and often aids in decisions whether subconsciously or consciously. The goal of the society in this book is to elimate this problem and make everyone societally \\"pretty\\" at age 16. As one could guess, not everything is as good as it seems, secrets are revealed, rebellion is started, etc. It took me quite a while, probably half the book to find myself invested in the characters to the point where I cared what happened to them and wanted to know what was going to happen next. By the end of the book, I couldn't put it down, and of course, the ending left me wanting more!
B00428ZRFE|4.0|Rihanna's message comes through loud and clear on this album.  She's sexy and she knows it!  She starts with a little song called \\"S&M\\", which leads us to believe that she gets a little \\"tied up\\" in her extracurricular activities.  Drake comes on to help her out with \\"What's My Name?\\" which is just as catchy as \\"S&M\\".  \\"Cheers (Drink To That)\\" is an alcohol-infused anthem about having drinks with friends on the weekend.  Who can't relate to that?  \\"Fading\\" is lackluster at best.  \\"Only Girl (In The World)\\" is another hot dance-y track that everyone and their mother knows the lyrics to.  \\"California King Bed\\" is one of my personal favorites, because of the amount of heart that Rihanna lays out on the table.  You can hear the yearning in her voice and the lyrics seem sincere and heartfelt.  \\"Man Down\\" is a dark, gripping tale of a girl shooting down a man who assaulted her.  Rihanna's accent comes out a lot in this one, but the sirens in the background drive me crazy.  Nicki Minaj joins in on \\"Raining Men\\", a fun little number about how there's plenty of guys out there, so there's no need to settle!  \\"Complicated\\" begs for the same sincerity of \\"California King Bed\\", but it's not completely terrible.  \\"Skin\\" is meant to be a sexy love song, but it creeps me out so much that I skip it every single time.  Finally, there's \\"Love The Way You Lie (Part II)\\" where Rihanna is joined by Eminem to discuss their volatile, yet fictional relationship.  This song paints a pretty (ugly) picture of a story of two people who seem like they're not meant to be, but would they make it with anyone else?  I keep this album in my car at all times because most of the songs are fun and bouncy and keep me awake on long drives.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the show don't love the service. It froze near the end I restated, froze is the same spot something is wrong with amazon streaming.
B000H305U0|5.0|This album is hands down one of my favorite albums ever.  It's one of those albums that I don't skip a single song on (unless I just want to hear the same one over and over).  You can dance to almost every song on the album, which is pretty fantastic.  \\"Summer Love\\" and \\"Chop Me Up\\" are definitely my favorite tracks, but songs like \\"SexyBack\\" are the real crowd-pleasers.  Timberlake uses his smooth, sexy voice to his advantage on every track.  If you haven't heard these songs yet (which really, have you been under a freakin' rock), you won't be disappointed!  This is my go-to road trip album!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I would highly recommend this show for anyone over 13.  It is relatively clean, yet highly adventurous.  The plot is full of unexpected twists and turns.  The characters are full of depth and the story line is one of the most cleverly written that I have ever seen.  The filming and the staging are equally up to par.
B009O07NDY|2.0|While this soundtrack contains a great score as expected, I've found that the tracks do not actually contain the same tracks that were used at parts in the movie.  For instance, the Misty Mountains song that was so moving in the movie is only on the soundtrack by itself and in a variant form.  Nowhere in the soundtrack is the song presented along with the booming score as it was in the movie and this is quite disappointing as it was one of the main reasons I purchased this soundtrack.<br /><br />As noted, the overall score is fantastic but if you're looking for something specific I would give it a listen before buying.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game so does my daughter and granddaughter.I keep horses so I have the real thing but I still enjoy playing this game.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Hubby bought this because of the reviews. For such a small knife sharpener, it works great! It even sharpens his Swiss Army knife.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I would definitely recommend this game for all ages. Definitely Five stars. My family and I have really enjoyed it.  Graphics are even good too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game! My kids and husband also enjoy this game very much. We challenge each other to see who is the best. GO a head and download ir, you know you want to.
B007R0WHMK|2.0|Yet another bizarre tale so incredibly \\"out-there\\" that it garners fab reviews. While I went back and forth throughout the film between \\"Love it\\" and \\"Hate it\\" as many other reviewers have said, the ending simply topped it off and landed me firmly in the \\"Hate it\\" camp. It blows my mind that this is rated, overall, as a 4-5 star film, similar to the feeling I had when I watched \\"Drive\\" and \\"Black Swan.\\"<br /><br />In my opinion, being strange, obscene, and uncomfortable does not a classic, award-winning movie make.
B007712XAU|5.0|I was so glad to get these as I had missed them first time around. Now I can see them more than once and enjoy them all over again.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|There were quite a few new characters introduced in this  book and I enjoyed Jaime and Cersei's story lines. The book picks up toward the end. Satisfying , but I am looking forward to reconnecting with some of the old characters, especially Daenarys.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|These  dvds travel through John Adams' live showing details of the man he was. It also gives an intimate portrait of Abigail Adams.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I liked this BOOK because it was sad and funny. This book is good for all ages and for parents.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Such a cute movie and it has a good moral.<br />Really wanted to watch it when I was sick, but couldn't find a rental except on Amazon.  You get it for a full 24 hours and can watch it as many times as you want for only a few bucks.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Awesome book loved it...great read ..if you,'re a science fiction fan this is the book  I didn't put it down
1590200918|3.0|Spoiler alert!  I had heard about and wanted to read The Woman in Black for quite some time, so when a friend gave me this \\"ghost story\\" by the same author, I was really pleased.  The reviews on the back touted the book as thrilling and super scary, so as soon as I got the chance, I started the book.  The characters are the usual suspects in any ghost story:  the elderly Oxford professor, his rather ordinary former student, the old countess who lives in an ancient country house.  All of these people are tied together by a strange painting that seems to both cause and reflect the tragic events in the characters' lives.  Will the mystery be solved?<br />The Man in the Picture seems to have all the elements for a successful ghost story--the right atmosphere, the right cast of characters, and a supernatural puzzle.  Unfortunately, as the plot unfolds, these characters never really come to life--they have all the personality of pawns in the Clue game.  This defect means that the reader doesn't develop empathy and the mystery remains merely intellectual.  Nor do we understand the motives behind the characters' actions.  Why was the jilted bride so vengeful, when her planned marriage was only an agreement between families and not a love match?  Why does Parmitter leave the painting to his former student when he knows it will only ruin his life?  So many questions arise and are never satisfactorily answered.<br />The Man in the Picture is short enough, and the plot is interesting enough, that I don't really regret reading it.  But it also isn't a truly satisfying ghost story--no goosebumps, no hair standing on end, no creepy feeling that there just might be more to that odd little painting on the wall in your own house.  Sadly this is a mediocre attempt at horror.
B00005JLWN|5.0|For some reason, I love this movie. It's a dumb action movie, it's predictable, and the story isn't even that great - but I love it.<br /><br />The setting, the action, the stunts, the visuals.. all amazing. A great cast of actors really bring it to life, too.<br /><br />If you want to stop thinking and start being entertained, try Equilibrium.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Love the fact that the collection comes in a durable tin case! I have not yet watched it but was pleasantly surprised as to how fast the movies arrived! Thanks!
B0052REUW0|2.0|I was pointed towards this book as a result of several heated, passionate discussions with a good friend of mine over the state of the world and its history. Both of us are well-read on the subject, albeit from widely disparate disciplines. Despite Pinker's good name, I had not heard about this book at its release, and it slipped under my radar until recommended by this friend. Assuring me that it would give me some of the rational substance I crave when sociologists and political analysts try to claim expert status on existence, I gave it a look.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that I was quite disappointed by the failure of this book to do anything resembling its stated mission: to wit, to illustrate in unsentimental, empirical terms how violence on macro and micro scales and overall amoral and &#34;bad&#34; behavior has decreased over History (capitalization intended). In fact, Pinker devotes a lengthy introduction to restating his thesis many times over, leaving me more or less chomping at the bit saying, &#34;I can't wait to hear you start making this case!&#34;<br /><br />He doesn't, however, and it came over me in a slow, abrupt realization that I had been conned. Pinker's &#34;evidence&#34; of how much worse all those old-timey people were comes, for the first few dozen pages, from samples of bloody and cruel behavior in FICTIONAL WORKS and THE BIBLE. He, in fact, acknowledges that the extensive stories of genocide and mass rape and murder in the Bible are probably not drawn from actual historical events (there's no evidence of several of the massive military campaigns of the Old Testament having ever actually occurred), but holds them up simply as examples of the bloody-minded mentality of people at the time. &#34;See? They wrote nasty stories about raping people and massacring innocents. They were more violent than us!&#34; I think I have my &#34;Django Unchained&#34; ticket stub around here somewhere...<br /><br />This would be fine if &#34;Better Angels&#34; simply used this as a warmup and transitioned to a real critical analysis of Pinker's thesis. I want hard numbers of real, historically verifiable events AND an explanation of how they scale to modern society, if you're going to make a statement as profound as essentially saying that human nature has changed! In the end, I felt more as though I was reading a 'persuasive essay' like the thousands I wrote in high school and undergraduate university, particularly high school, where you can string together lots of arguments without having to cite empirical evidence. &#34;The Vikings sailed around burning down villages and taking slaves. They were scary, and caused chaos wherever they went. Fortunately, there are no Vikings anymore. In conclusion, this is a safer world. I hope you enjoyed buying this book as much as I enjoyed writing it.&#34;<br /><br />I ended up feeling that &#34;Better Angels&#34; was a dodge, almost even a con drawing in people intrigued by the title, feeling tugged by what tattered shreds of existential optimism they still have to give it a try. But lengthy comparisons to battling chimpanzees, quotations from fiction and reference to ancient nomadic cannibals and warring native American tribes offer no explicit rejection of the notion that human drives for violence have, indeed, declined.<br /><br />While I'm not saying that Pinker's thesis is wrong- by certain standards of analysis, I agree with him- I felt this book was poorly executed and disappointing. I would have liked a much more dispassionate and direct comparison of facts, and less shock stories of loinclothed savages committing atrocities while blue-jeaned modern First Worlders look on in their highly evolved distaste.simply used this as a warmup and transitioned to a real critical analysis of Pinker's thesis.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazing game you have to buy it<br />Can't believe how fun it is that sheep is so fat cramp cramp
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Disclaimer #1: I have not been a lifelong Dredd fan and apart from prior awkward film adaptations and a few graphic novels, am not an expert.    Disclaimer #2: I am a girl, and do not attach any degree of self-esteem to identifying with square-jawed fascists, so I have no pony in this race whatsoever.    In case you're under the age of 20 and missed the original point of Judge Dredd, it was a piece of social commentary most relevant in the 1980's UK featuring a very recognizable Orwellian future of overpopulation, hyperscarcity, and fascism- all very well-traveled literary themes in 70's and early 80's literature, film and television.    Before I've lost ALL of the tl;dr crowd (as opposed to the 90+% I've already lost), the point is this: you were NOT supposed to empathize with or identify with Judge Dredd or any of his ridiculous counterparts. They were supposed to be caricatures of a legal system run amok, a Patriot Act carried to its logical extension into a dystopian future where there are way more criminals than jails, and nobody really cares what the social causes of crime are anymore. It was about fascism, plain and simple: the idea that if society continued on its current course, we would ultimately accept the ultimate abrogation of our civil liberties and freedoms for protection from the near-total anarchy that complete scarcity would bring about, and we'd let a bunch of hypermacho cops run around dispensing absurdly harsh penalties for every crime they could come across. Also, there are psychics. Who are universally hot chicks. And a Judge that was a fish. And the Grim Reaper and stuff.    This movie, which I hated even more than the 90's version that I merely disliked, stripped out any higher concepts completely in favor of a very generic high-octane shoot-em-up. Now, don't get me wrong, I like gun porn as much as the next girl that likes gun porn, but if you're going to borrow an intellectual property, you should at least take a vague stab at incorporating something more than the name and vague look of what you're doing (I'm looking at YOU, Star Trek).    Short no-spoiler synopsis: Judge Dredd and a trainee Judge shoot their way up from the ground floor of a gigantic crime-infested tenement to the top, where they have a not-terribly climactic confrontation with the big boss, a lady drug lord who employs a big s***load of people who are all guilty of being brown and poor (which seems to be what most people in Mega City One are guilty of in this particular imagining of \\"Dredd\\").  Seriously, that's it. That's the entire plot. Oh, yeah. The trainee is a psychic. Because she's a hot chick. Which ends up being barely relevant to the story. Except that she can sense that everyone wants to rape her. You know, because they're criminals. Also, they sing the raps and shoot all the jobs.    If this were just a regular unbranded action flick, I'd give it 3 stars or so- it's very generic gun action, lean on plot and high on shooter porn- but to be honest, it isn't even fantastic action. Gun fights have the silly absurdity of Robocop- bad guys shoot thousands of rounds at no one and nothing, protagonists are magically immune to gunfire, no one runs out of ammo, and conflicts are as empty and meaningless as a platformer video game.    You want a stupid, mindless shoot-em-up, rent a Resident Evil movie. At least there are more cute girls and nobody's pretending to act.
0374275637|5.0|Well written, with some fascinating insight into psychology, statistics and economics.  Can't be read quickly, but worth spending the time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Writers are going to keep us on our seats for another season! Looking forward to continuing my viewership.<br /><br />It's worth watching...this is from someone who doesn't watch much television.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The story grabbed me from the start and never let go. In earlier years, I'd almost certainly have read it in one (or maybe a few) sittings, but I've gotten more patient as I've aged.<br /><br />Certainly, geek-knowledge of the 80s greatly enhances the appreciation of the references, but I don't think it's necessary for enjoying the story.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is the kind of book that found me at the right time in my life. This is one of those books that everyone must read as a guide to following your bliss. The words of wisdom in this book will stay with you and continue to guide you in the right path.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|An interesting story line.  The acting was excellent.  Hopkins and Mirren are always good.  I didn't realize tha Psycho ws based on a real character.
B00000IZOR|4.0|My granddaughter loves this phone.  Now that she is walker she can pull it around. Her mom believes it keeps her away from her cell phone which is great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me up at night-I couldn't out it down! The characters are believable, yet unexpected!<br />The short chapters kept me turning!
B000L53D4O|4.0|My granddaughter has been playing with this since she was 6 months old.  Lay flat on the floor and she would go at it.  Now that she can walk, she is still enjoying this item which I think is great.  Shapes and colors...getting them started early.
B001NHNG64|5.0|If you liked, &#34;Killing Floor&#34;, you'll love this one too.  I can't get enough of the Reacher series, these books are so hard to put down.  Any fan of this genre will love these books.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Every bit as good as the first book. The authors have a way of pulling you in and getting you involved with the characters. Can't wait to see what happens next.
0062014536|2.0|The ending ruined the whole series for me. Kind of wished I wouldn't have read it now. Should have just stopped at 2 if I wasn't going to get any closure.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I have waited a long time to buy any of the STOS series and I'm glad I did. The picture quality, the color, and the outright crystal clarity are stunning. Probably much better than what anyone was able to see on their TVs at the time it was originally broadcast. Every episode has been meticulously restored frame by frame. No scratches, no blips, no sound drop outs. This set gives you two for one. You get the original episode as it was produced in the 60s with the original special effects (models on strings) or you can watch each episode with updated CGI exterior shots of the enterprise and alien planets. They even added a few touches (such as the Gorn's eyes blinking) to add more realism to the viewing experience. You also get the original pilot, The Cage with the original script which was never aired, and the Menagerie which was aired as part of the original series with or without updated effects.<br />There is a small problem with the disc menu. If you want to exit this menu, you must back out completely before pushing the STOP button as it may lock up your Blue Ray player. Even with that, this is a beautiful production and worthy of the hardcore Trek fans.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I had just gotten the Bible YouVersion so I'm just now using it but what I have seen it is great.  The bookmarks the print and so many other things that I would HIGHLY recommend to everyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great Book. Nicholas Sparks is becoming one of my favorite authors.<br />Love the twist of the story.  Romance novels can get to be so predictable.
B001M3LG84|5.0|Herr Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra provide an animated and fun presentation of classical music mixed with a variety or other music acts. Their live concerts are quite good too. They are in the USA this week mostly on the West Coast and Canada. If you can scoop tickets it is definitely worth it.
0393342212|5.0|a perennial favorite as a gift for troubled parents, I will continue to use this as a standard for chldren'g problems
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|The bottom line of this book is &#34;Do stuff. Do it well.&#34; Easy and fun read compared to a lot of the books I've read for MBA classes and quite frankly, there's more direct and useful information in this one. Highly recommend it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|RIGHT from the beginning it was predictable,girl meets guy...they fall in love,then things fall apart...Gillian Flynn uses the F Word way too<br />Much!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thanks so much for this.  I needed to catch up!!!  Watched 1 and 2 on Netflix so needed to catch up with current shows.  Easy to download on the computer with no interruptions.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It's one you won't want to put down.  I highly recommend it.  David Baldacci at his best.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its not bad. I don't like the fact that you have to unlock each level with diamonds which cost money
0061743526|1.0|I apologize for not reviewing the content and only the quality of the physical book.<br /><br />I ordered the 50th anniversary hardcover and I'm really disappointed and will be returning it. The jacket isn't very pretty in person and the black hardcover itself under the jacket is solid matte black and nothing special. Also the pages are bound unevenly which gives the pages edges a frayed appearance (not sure if that was intentional or if I got a book from a bad batch, either way it looks horrible).<br /><br />I paid $14 for this, I'm going to return it and go to Barnes and Noble to get a leather bound embossed copy for $18.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Standard mediocre movie that doesn't really go anywhere and leaves loose ends that you're glad aren't tied up... because they were also boring
B0067R0APK|5.0|Easy and fun to use. Even my husband enjoys using it.<br />Big help this past winter to know when we had to governments etc.
B007712XAU|5.0|This was well worth the money. It did include the Christmas episode, which some versions do not, so I was very pleased to watch that. I love English movies and mini-series, and Downton Abbey is one of my favorites.<br />I also want to say that this seller, TANR, gave me the best service I have received on Amazon, which is saying a lot because I have had great service most of the time, so I would recommend you purchase from this seller as well. I received my product in a two days even without expedite shipping, which was a nice surprise.<br />Downton Abbey will bring you hours of enjoyment that you will want to watch again and again.Beautiful costumes and scenery.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|&#34;I look to you&#34; is the most emotional song I've heard. As I listened to the words, it's as if Whitney knew she would not be here much longer....... so sad. 20 songs so I don't get bored with it.
6303122647|5.0|I love this movie, and I still have my VHS/DVD combo player, so I was able to get the VHS copy when they were out of the DVD.<br />This will be a yearly Halloween watch!  I like all of Tim Burton's movies, but this may be my favorite animation, although I have yet to see Frankenweenie. That will be next!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee is an amazing mother, human being and daughter. What a fighter, I loved this book. It was so interesting that I read it  very quickly.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|OMG! This app is amazing the picture is great you can see what you are doing so clearly. I don't see what people mean about the weird sounds. Just turn off the volume! Duh! But seriously this a great app.
B00351YEVC|5.0|i havent read the book but the movie is so sad i just cant read the book it is so gripping and reminds people what it was like in WW2 i would recommend it to anyone but why did they make the end so sad? why. thats a question
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Everyone who loves this film has already told you why and I agree. Fun film-within-a-film genre, works well for tween audience due to scary imagery & one gratuitous f-bomb. Elle Fanning steals every scene she's in.
0446580848|1.0|I could not put down \\"The Lion's Game,\\" and even bought several copies as gifts for friends, telling them, \\"You MUST read this!\\"  I was hoping for more of the same with \\"The Panther,\\" but unfortunately this doesn't even come close.  I do not recall this volume of constant smart-alecky comments from Corey on the other books - it just does not stop. Yes, I remember him having a dry sense of humor, but this is ridiculous and detracts from the entire story line. I'm currently on p. 476 (out of 625) of the hardcover and STILL waiting for something to happen. At this point, it's nothing but sheer stubbornness that keeps me from abandoning it. Enormous disappointment from an author I have always truly enjoyed.
B005HSL626|5.0|Everyone loves this game for good reason---fruit juice instead of blood, fruit instead of people, fast pace, big points. Love it.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|I loved this one.  I'm a bit Tim Burton fan from way back.  Good story line, great animation, good clean fun for the whole family.<br /><br />Tom
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great for doctors' waiting rooms, long car trips, annoying phone calls from relatives, you get the idea. Don't get hooked. Get outside, throw a ball with your kids, take a walk, live an actual life!
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I'm a big kid when it comes to movies like this.  I enjoy the animation even at my age of 55.  I liked the story line, I like the characters, I though it was a good all around family movie.  I like that the little guy comes out on top in the end.<br /><br />Tom
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I just love these guys! The music is phenomenal and the videos are awesome. I will be looking for more &#62;
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I am astounded that what is so ugly can also be so beautiful....words that are true of so many things, this book being one. A story of Hitler Germany which contains the beauty and ugliness of the human heart.
B009YX02T8|4.0|We saw the movie and liked the songs so we decided to buy the soundtrack. The soundtrack is nice to listen to when you are relaxing, though there are some songs that are better than others, which is probably normal for soundtracks. Still, I'm not disappointed in the soundtrack.
B00A7OJ0DC|2.0|After 45 minutes into the movie I realised I hadn't so much as smiled, let alone LoL. I thought this movie had promise but was totally let down. A lot of the games portrayed in the movie were from the 80s, my ara, so you would've thought that the humor would've been directed to kids as well as us adults. It really wasn't. Honestly, I was bored so bad I shut the movie off and went and boiled some eggs, I'm not kidding. Furthermore, after the beforementioned 45 minutes of viewing, I should also like to say that I didn't see any reason to make the movie in 3D. No reason at all.<br /><br /> Ugh! This movie failed!!
0399142959|5.0|I have been following her books though I am behind many others because I just started reading them recently. I was not disappointed in this one, though I wondered when the story would have a resolution when I noticed that I was running out of pages and things were still up in the air. I am happy with the ending though I wonder if she rushed this book to press. But I wasn't disappointed, so I have started the next one now.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very entertaining and fun to play. I play it all the time along with my little cousin she plays it likes its her real pet horse.
B00AKCJB44|5.0|This soundtrack is incredible. Not much more needs to be said. If you loved the movie (and you should have, it was great) you should buy this.

Addressing the subconscious belief systems, personal healing is achieved at the core, the very base of dis-ease, thereby facilitating healing of the mental, physical, and/or emotional manifestations in personal health.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved this book. It is a very original take on the zombie genre, told as a series of personal memoirs in the aftermath of the zombie &#34;war&#34;. In a manner, it is a collection of many short stories from different chronological eras, telling the story of the genesis and spread of the infection.<br /><br />The story is tantalizing well written and at many points feels like it could actually happen in real life, and explores what happens to many diverse aspects of global society (my personal favourite was the tale of the international space station).<br /><br />The author has thoroughly researched the vocations and cultures that he touches upon. I am also pleased to see a US-centric novel, which so intelligently and accurately portrays other countries and cultures, from Canada to Cuba (which becomes the new economic superpower!?).<br /><br />Bravo and well done. The gold standard for the zombie genre. I fear for the movie version...
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|I have been a HUGE fan of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns for years. When I read it initially my thoughts were This IS Batman! This animated feature does not disappoint and vividly brings the ground breaking comic to life. The animation is well done and the voice acting is spot on. For a direct to video release the production value is very high. Also the film makes no compromises and sticks to Miller's story even keeping it placed in an 80ish era with slang and people from that time. A must see for fans. Not appropriate tor viewers under 12 I'd say.

B003CR9BYE|5.0|How is it that a recording from so long ago oozes with such perfection, sophistication, style, and the very best that is always imitated?  Because it is Sinatra and Jobim, the very best ever.  From singing in a whisper on Meditation, to percussion which is metal brushes on film cans...subtle, soft, swing.  If I get to heaven, these guys had better be the house band.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Love, love this book. It so raw. Well written. Sad and beautiful at the same time. I couldn't put it down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very cool app to keep you occupied.love it. Good app to keep younger siblings busy when you have a migraine.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Short (for Follet) historical fiction. Always like the ease at which Follet mixes his fictional characters with the historical ones.

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|A good version of batman.  The style I prefer for he is the Dark Knight.  Of the earlier released Batman movies I prefered Michael Keaton to Val Kilner and George Clooney.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I love Castle and reading this was like sitting back enjoying the TV series without the commercials.  Now on to the next one!
B008HK3XKO|3.0|I was just looking for a usable decent priced cover for my kindle and this fit the bill.  I later bought the Mo Ko Slim fit and preferred that design.  It is an ok cover for the price. The speakers are blocked unless you have it on it's side and propped. It is just a basic cover.

1468179993|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. While the book addresses TED Talks specifically this book is helpful for anyone giving a talk or presentation. Jeremey Donavan watched TED Talks in order to distill best practices so the examples were applicable and talks were easily found online. The book is well organized into two parts. Part one addresses content, story, and structure of a talk while part two covers delivery and design.<br /><br />Because of the books size, weighing in at 112 pages, the book feels like a TED Talk. TED talks are 18 minutes or less. They are not meant to be full fledge lectures. The book could have been more in depth, but because Donavan addresses his topics succinctly, the reader is able to get valuable information without having to dive into depths that might not be useful. Even with its brevity, Donavan covers important issues, not just with the structure of a talk, but also delivery issues such as the use of humor and overcoming fear.<br /><br />I liked the book's straightforwardness. It was not long, but it covered just about everything one would need to know. While this book was about delivering a Ted Talk, it would be equally useful for any type of talk. The book gives sound advice and guidance.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game is fun. It is entertaining but it does run out of activities. I have a horse but people who don't it gives them a horse to take care of
1475143389|5.0|I'm very pleased with this purchase. The author doesn't tell you how to lift using weight machines, only free weights. I personally don't want to use free weights,I'm nearing senior citizen status. So I use his methods for free weights and incorporated them for weight machines,as far as to how much weight to lift,when to add more, and how many reps per exercise. I'm seeing a good improvement in my muscle mass,getting leaner and stronger. Although I'm up in years, my job requires physical labor, and because because of his advice I'm better able to do my job. I'm looking forward more now going to the gym, I actually have a clue as what to do.

0307743659|5.0|It's been 35 years since I read \\"The Shining.\\" I was 18, it was my first introduction to a Stephen King novel, and the thing scared the everlovin' crap out of me. With the author coming out with a sequel entitled \\"Doctor Sleep\\" in September 2013, it seemed like a good time to revisit a classic. The book left such an impression on me back in 1978 that I still remember most key events from the story. Despite knowing the end results, I found the book to still be immensely entertaining and suspenseful.<br /><br />Jack, Wendy and Danny Torrance are between a rock and a hard place. Due to Jack's hair-trigger temper, alcoholism and other family dynamics, he winds up taking a job as the winter caretaker of a remote hotel in the Colorado mountains. Mr. King does a fine job of setting up the situation as very plausible. Being cut off from the rest of civilization due to snow for six or seven months in a empty hotel would've been a nonstarter for my wife, two sons and me. Heck, dumpster diving seems like a more appealing career move than hauling your family up into such a place. Add to it that the Overlook's haunted and you can bet your sweet bippy this chicken would've hightailed it to civilization at the first sign of something weird. The three main characters are given ample time in the story to be fleshed out and for the reader to understand their fears, hopes and motivations. You'll find yourself rooting for the family and hoping they get out of this mess. Even the father, Jack Torrance, with his awful faults is a sympathetic character.<br /><br />What makes \\"The Shining\\" an exceptionally good, terrifying story is never knowing what or when something will go bump in the night. I've read about thirty of Mr. King's works and this baby is still one of my favorites.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was one of the best books I have ever read. I recommend to all. You will not be disappointed
B0063GORYU|4.0|great gameto stimulate your brain...and the graphics make it easy to use...love the &quot;hint&quot;feature...good to play when hou want more ofa challenge than regular solitaire
B003MC5N28|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I've read. Although I wish it could be longer, it still told a great story. I can't definitely see why people say they are afraid of this book. This book really messes with you and your thoughts. It really makes you stop a think about what life you are living now and how you would feel with out every little detail that makes \\"living\\" worth it. So without a doubt, this book has a good reason for a gold metal on its cover. I highly recommend this book to anyone that isn't scared of things happening that we don't want happening (unless you don't have a soul)
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Streaming a rental from Amazon is not as good as the streaming quality of the picture from TWC or Nexflix.  Twice I rented through Amazon, but, will not do this again. Picture quality was very poor on both occasions. This is unfortunate as I am a new Prime member. Unless you have suggestions?
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|would love another one. love the graphics and scenes would be nice too see more of where we're going some areas were hard because you are jumping randomly to see things. made it more of a challenge which was good.
1583334386|5.0|This book is very good, very helpful information for anyone dealing with willpower issues, overeating, smoking cessation, etc.  I did not like her use of strong, unnecessary, almost offensive language, but otherwise the book is excellent.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Great story, exciting all around movie with a good ending.this is a movie I could watch repeatedly. Definitely worth watching.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My son is almost 6 years old and loves toplay The Amazing Spider Man. It is a great game! We bougt the game 3 weeks ago and he still playing it every time he is alowed to play games.
0446310786|5.0|I suppose anyone who reads has read this book.  I recently read it for the third time and it would be in my top 20 of all-time favorite books.  Atticus Finch is about as fine a man as one would ever find in American literature.  There are some fine people in this book:  Scout, Jem, Miss Maudie, Tom Robinson, Judge Taylor, Underwood, Boo and more.  There is humor, history, family, values and much more.  I was impressed with the white working poor.  Poor farmers who would not accept relief.  Tom Robinson was a married man with a family.  He worked hard and was a credit to the human race.  The Walter Cunninghams and Tom Robinsons of today's world would all be on welfare.  Back then men had a sense of personal pride.  They scraped by (even during the Great Depression) and did not look for handouts.  Today those type of men have become like Robert Ewell.  No count and shiftless and expecting handouts as somehow they are entitled.  All the participants of the Occupy Wall St crowd should read this book but I suppose they'd be too busy living in the &#34;world&#34; of their ipads.  There is so much human dignity in this book.  It is the only book Harper Lee ever published and she hit a home run.  Miss Lee will be 87 next month and spends a great deal of time in her native Monroeville (&#34;Maycomb&#34;), Alabama.  She is Scout all grown up.  I'd love to thank her personally for her book.  It had a great influence on the many good people of our country.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is my 6 years old son's best game. He loves to play Subway Surfers. What a great idea!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We have watched the whole series and as usual British actors are the best. The story line has a lot of stress in being believable but it could happen this way.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son is almost 6 years old and is having fun wht the game. It makes him think before any moving and it help him toe exercise the hability to be creative.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|4 1/2 star game. Love the frequent changes and challenges. Don't like that u need so many coins for diff characters and boards. But overall great!
B0060AY85C|5.0|I love the way she writes I wanted another couple of chapters because I knew I was going to miss the characters.
0385732554|1.0|I cannot think of anything positive. This book should only be read by a true science fiction lover in high school.
B006LSZECO|2.0|First half of the book was slow and not well written.<br />With a little thought you would think some kind of closure could have been given to this story
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I hate to admit that I had never read the whole book.  I had only read parts of it and heard other people speak of it over the years, but I am glad I read it.  It was thoroughly mesmerizing.  I wanted to go back and read some of the classics that I had missed, and Wuthering Heights was the first one I chose.
B009SH5JS4|3.0|If you're looking for Academy awarding winning romance, this isn't it. BUT it's great fun and watching Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan's chemistry develop is an interesting ride. All with the beautiful backdrop of France.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|that is hard i dont like that level and thats the only level that i have to do with no hints.
B002LFAHBO|3.0|Nothing too complicated about the plot. Several side stories running parallel to one another to converge into a big lovely finale. Definitely a feel good movie if you need one.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I so wish that this book was longer. This was a great story. I hope that someday Brandon Sanderson revisits this character and adds to her story . I would love to see more of this magic system .
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Though fiction and set in a time so long ago, this book is so well written and researched it reads like a true account. Painful, emotional, well paced,  with two distinct narrators and a cast of characters you can envision. I wanted to be completely absorbed into a book I could not put down. And was.
B003B02O14|4.0|Great story. No one tells it better than Grisham. There is s little bit of Patrick in all of us.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|It was a good book overall I liked the story but that story was hard to follow. It was not as good as the first one although I look forward to read the next book.

B004S3MB2U|5.0|I picked this up during the Free App of the Day offer, and boy am I happy I did. Originally, I just wanted to see if it would suitably replace RealCalc, as I was tired of the random nag screens. But when I discovered it did conversions for measurements, distances, and could be dumbed down to a simple mode if I decided I didn't want all the fanciness? Perfect app. Worth the ten bucks once it goes off the freebie, but VERY much worth nabbing during the daily freebie!
B003R50FRI|5.0|An enlightening read - giving an insight into the real &#34;heart&#34; of India.  One man's amazing journey of discovery of, not so much<br />the land, but himself and the people of Mumbai,

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I just got into DSLR camers and this bag works perfect for what I need. I have my lighting, 2 lenses, camera, and a few 2x and wide angel lenses and they all fit fine. The inside pockets hold quite a bit and the front 2 pockets are deep and go the depth of the bag. I don't even use them as I don't have enough things yet, but they will come in handy as my collection expands. The straps on the side aren't exactly made to hold up a 60-inch or larger tripod by any means but if you had to I'm sure they'd work fine. Great bag.

B007THA4FI|3.0|The story was rather involved but it moved slowly for me. I found it an average read. The characters were well defined but the story didn't excite me to want to keep reading after it ended.

B008NBEXZQ|5.0|SANS ATTENDRE is the Celine Dion CD I've been waiting for! My dad passed away when I was very young and there are certain songs, I hear, that leave me in deep thought.  PARLER A MON PERE is now at the top of that list.  The moment I heard it, I was moved to tears.  Beyond all things, I would love to talk to my dad again.  CELLE QUI M'A TOUT APPRIS bring me right to my grandmother.  Listen to the song, and it should bring you to the one who taught you about life, love, etc.  I have other faves as well, LES PETITS PIEDS DE LEA, LA MER ET L'ENFANT and of course the classic NE ME QUITTE PAS -- Magnificent!  Though, I am a French speaker, anyone can and WILL fall in love with this sweet CD........Totally enchanting, superb!

B0038BBA4I|5.0|I like the Avett Brothers' albums The Gleam 1 and 2, and this artist I found to be a bit similar in genre. Think The Gleam 2 but more melodic, more instrumental, and more moody.
B004L35GAQ|4.0|This artist or person depending on how you look at it combines mutiple styles of music within one CD not many artist do that now a days.  I will give my honest viewpoint of what I think of this album, track by track.<br />Track One: Good musical intro with the artist name thrown into the music<br />Track Two: A filler and not a very good one at that makes you go really why is it here<br />Track Three: Soul Wars, A song that has a good beat and makes you feel like getting up and dance to the beat<br />Track Four: People, A song that makes you feel like you want to get up and sing the lyrics as he sings them and something you might hear within a church with the chorus<br />Track Five: Jump on my Shoulders, Another good song on this CD makes you think of Robin Hood because of the chorus take from the rich give to the poor, plus has a very nice beat in the song also to make you feel good<br />Track Six: Burn it Down is the title of this song and we all feel angery enough to want something to burn down from time to time<br />Track Seven: Gulity Filthy Soul makes you realize when your feeling down and see the trueself that is you<br />Track Eight: Kill your Heroes a Pop-Rockish song that the lyrics make you go did he really just say those words<br />Track Nine: Another filler that makes who wonder why it's on the CD<br />Track Ten: Sail, The main reason most people buy this CD because it's an amazing song and intresting lyrics all the way threw to the end of the song<br />Track Eleven: Wake Up, Another feel good song that makes you want to dance to or groove to on the dance floor<br />Track Tweleve: Not your Fault, Pop Rock feel to it and makes you see how he feels about the person he is talking about on the song<br />Track Thirteen: All I need, Softer side of the singer based on the lyrics makes you feel good and makes you want to smile also something you might hear in a church<br />Track Fourteen: Knights of Shame, Intresting lyrics from both male singers and a female singer plus the music styles within the one song sounds almost rap, rock, and pop within one song, but I do believe the song should have eneded at the 11 minutes and 40 second mark instead of going onto almost 15 minutes<br />But overall a four star CD I take one star off for track two and nine because they are fillers, But rest of the CD is quite amazing great lyrics and amazing mixture of styles of music all within the one CD look forward to more music by the artist.inger plus the music styles within the one song sounds almost rap, rock, and pop within one song, but I do believe the song should have eneded at the 11 minutes and 40 second mark instead of going onto almost 15 minutes<br />But overall a four star CD I take one star off for track two and nine because they are fillers, But rest of the CD is quite amazing great lyrics and amazing mixture of styles of music all within the one CD look forward to more music by the artist.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like it it always shows me responsibly how to take care of a pet and my other 2 sister's have it and I have them as a friend. It's always so fun to send them a fight
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I thought I would love this game. As soon as I pressed that app it ask me for my email and facebook username and password and twitter. I knew right away I wouldn't play the game often infact I can't even play it!!!!!!!!!
B004SIP7XK|5.0|Gone Baby Gone follows private investigators Patrick and Angie when they are hired to find an abducted 4-year-old girl. Gone Baby Gone is a compelling, thought-provoking drama.<br /><br />The story is very compelling and often thought-provoking. This is an excellent blend of mystery, drama, and thriller. The dialogue in this film feels authentic, and it's used effectively to create edge-of-your-seat moments. I couldn't believe how immersive and engaging the dialogue was when I first watched this film, and it stays effective to this day. The film also does a great job making the audience think; during several scenes, I asked myself, \\" What would I do?\\"; this was most evident during the tense, unforgettable ending. The story felt balanced and moved at a solid pace. The acting in this film is great, Casey Affleck really has a superb performance. The music in this film was also great matched the tone/atmosphere of the film.<br /><br />The Blu-ray of this film comes on a single disc and has excellent film and sound quality. The Blu-ray also has plenty of special features, including deleted scenes and an alternate ending. This product is definitely recommended for first-time buyers and those looking to upgrade from the DVD.<br /><br />Overall, Gone Baby Gone is a brilliant film, supported by its compelling storyline, its thought-provoking dilemmas, excellent performances, and tight direction from Ben Affleck. I HIGHLY recommend a purchase.<br /><br />Gone Baby Gone has strong violence and blood, and excessive profanity.
B00992CF6W|4.0|i have enjoyed playing this version, although the controls took some getting used to (i normally play on the 360)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I wasn't happy at first but I did give it an honest try. The more you play the more fun it gets. Now I'm totally hooked. I'm very happy with this game now. Is a keeper. &lt;3
B001ANSS5K|4.0|Awesome story, very easy to read with a great plot line.  Would recommend highly to both young and old alike.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It makes me want be so happy :) I love it more than food or my phone I will die I play it in a piazza parler No Surfing siting and playing this game its even free
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|its a good movie and its not the average movie that some hack bangs out in a few months. its like reading a novel. you have to think about things that are not explicitly discussed or shown. the viewer has to put some thought and reflection into the viewing. if you dont want to ponder or chew on the balance of power in the world, within ones self, or over individual foibles then watch something else. watch die hard or taken. but if, every once in a while, just pontificating about something slow and quiet appeals to you then watch this, shut your mouth, and enjoy.
B009Z59ZNE|4.0|I enjoyed The House of Cards and thought the acting was excellent.  I gave it a 4 star rating because I could not believe that a British prime minister would commit four murders.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Pros: Fully functional demo, works well on Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Con: Too many and too often reminders to purchase the full version
B00B2DSK06|4.0|If you want some eye candy, drop in a quarter and get ready for a \\"Sugar Rush.\\"  The story telling is Hollywood standard, tight and fun.  A few too many modern quips and familiar tropes in certain dialog, but it's forgivable.  It's the details that charm though.<br /><br />Everything is a valentine to the old skool video-game visuals.  Heck, the titular character leaps around the screen at one point with the exact \\"physics\\" as Mario and Luigi from \\"Mario Bothers.\\" Three decades later, I instantly recognized it and started looking for turtles elsewhere on the screen.<br /><br />And it's not just the older games, but the more contemporary ones as well.  Maybe you have to have lived in Tokyo to appreciate how pitch-perfect the depiction of the Japanese racing game for female tweens truly is, but (trust me) it's fully realized.<br /><br />It's that kind of trip, so how can you not love it?<br /><br />Top it all off with a Buckner and Garcia original... If you know and appreciate that reference, rent or buy this now!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I am so thankful I read The Art of Racing in the Rain. I have read a great number of pet loss books, but all were self-help types; sterile, little help. This story is so real. It is written as if watching a movie and being narrated. It is the sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry and that is real life. I have had 3 awesome Retrievers go on before me over the years and each time I was devastated. I wish I would have had this book before the first one closed her eyes almost 40 years ago. Maybe I could have accepted all those times better. This book has given me a hope; something true and endearing to picture. My precious I have now is nearing 13 years old. I know I will be so heart broken when the time comes, but thanks to this book, I have a hope; something I will easily picture in my mind that I truly believe happens and that lightens my heart.
B0041D843M|5.0|Huge amount of health and nutrition information.  Everyone should read this book!  Gifted the Kindle edition to my dad so that he can use the information to make better decisions about his own health.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have fixed about 7 X-Box 360's using this stuff (all using one tube) and 2 PS3's. I use it in my computer builds as well. This stuff is great. I tried silicone based (the white paste) and it doesn't even compare.  Its good stuff.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Thought it was a terrible ending. The language was useless and offensive. There are better books to read in this genre.
B00BHMF578|3.0|Good story, excellent no-nonsense production..my copy however was low quality for an HD version, both the sound and the video...
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Not too complicated that younger ones can´t figure it out. I wished the badges were more accessible by playing and less by buying. At times game just shuts down.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Whenever people tell me they don't like to read I tell them they are just reading the wrong books!<br />Then I tell them to read Good Omens.

B007A4SDCG|5.0|If you are an artist you need to ask yourself why you don't already have this book.  This book can be read and re-read for a lifetime.
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|Soilwork all grown up. This is a very mature release. It's a very modernized version of the soilwork sound. It sounds like they started up from where they left off with the panic broadcast, although it is very different on a lot of songs than that album. I still think their greatest work is A Predator's Portrait. Still this is a very good release. There is a ton of melodic leads - the 2 discs make this a very diverse album. Great vocals, great sound overall. Very original. I'm very happy to see soilwork back. It's ashame they lost Peter again, but this album shows that they can make great music without him. If you can't find 1 track that you like outa 20 songs, then well I guess this just isn't for you. I have heard some ppl say that the album is kind of boring. I have also heard some ppl say that the album is overhyped. I like it what can I say?<br /><br />standout tracks: tongue, vesta, the windswept mercy, entering aeons, loyal shadow
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|the product is very practical. it keeps on record your calculations, which makes it easy in case you need to chech a data.
B00ARAO0WM|1.0|When I saw the trailer I thought it looked stupid.  Then it came out on bluray and the reviews said it was pretty good.  Don't be fooled, this movie is really lame.
0307277453|2.0|The science of the book itself is really cool - it explains how many of our good and bad human traits are the direct result of our evolutionary path and ancestors. I was very turned off, however, by Shubin's constant insistence that this means humans are insignificant, and just another twig on a large tree. If you think that humans have a special place in the universe, or even that someone created them on purpose, you probably won't like this book.
B005ZB91KY|2.0|This was the worst movie of the Avengers spin-offs.  Not a whole lot of action and the main character is not very likable.
B00A83075M|5.0|Have you ever felt like you were stuck in a role you never wanted to play? Constantly subjected to scorn and ridicule simply for performing the only task available to you? What if you could change that?<br /><br />  Fix-it Felix Jr. has been a popular game in Litvak's for years. The hero and titular character, Felix (voiced by Jack McBrayer) has a magic hammer that can repair any damage done by the game's villain, Ralph. When the game is over, Felix is given a medal while Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is tossed off the roof by the tenants of the building he failed to destroy. When the arcade closes and the game is turned off, Ralph returns to his home atop a garbage heap in the nearby dump. For recreation, he visits Tapper's, a vintage game that assigns the player the role of a bartender. Also, upon our introduction to the story, Ralph makes his first visit to a support group for video game villains. Among the villains in attendance at Bad-Anon, we see M. Bison and Zangief from Street Fighter (voiced by Gerald C. Rivers and director Rich Moore respectively), a ghost from Pac-Man (voiced by Kevin Deters), and a zombie (Raymond Persi). During that meeting, he announces he no longer wants to be a bad guy. With the 30th anniversary of Fix-it Felix Jr., the tenants throw a party and \\"forget\\" to invite Ralph. Ralph crashes the party, in every sense of the word, and leaves soon after. Before he's left, he vows to return with a medal, something denied him by Felix and the tenants of the building he destroys. He seizes the opportunity to travel to a new game, a first-person shooter game called Hero's Duty, when a character from that game passes out in the bathroom. While at the center of Hero's Duty, Ralph is overwhelmed by the violence in modern games and refuses to heed the orders of his superior, Sergeant Calhoun (voiced by Jane Lynch). Once the arcade closes and the game ends, Ralph decides to forego the usual hurdles of Hero's Duty and steal the medal typically awarded to the winner. After stealing the medal and, unwittingly, bringing a menacing enemy insect known as a Cy-bug with him, Ralph heads to the kart-racing game Sugar Rush. It's there that he encounters the perpetually glitchy and terminally annoying Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman). Despite the initial friction, Ralph and Vanellope (Silverman) bond over their shared status as outcasts.<br /><br />  There is, of course, more to the story including Felix's pursuit of Ralph into the various other games and his budding romance with the no-nonsense Sergeant Calhoun, the true origin of Silverman's character, and an eventual revolt in the world of Sugar Rush. All of it, and I do mean all of it, had me riveted. I will say that, as a fan of old-style video games, I would've preferred seeing the character of Ralph travel to more than just the two different games besides his. Regardless of my criticisms, Wreck-It Ralph is hilariously entertaining and fun for viewers of all ages. Check it out.ed to the winner. After stealing the medal and, unwittingly, bringing a menacing enemy insect known as a Cy-bug with him, Ralph heads to the kart-racing game Sugar Rush. It's there that he encounters the perpetually glitchy and terminally annoying Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman). Despite the initial friction, Ralph and Vanellope (Silverman) bond over their shared status as outcasts.<br /><br />  There is, of course, more to the story including Felix's pursuit of Ralph into the various other games and his budding romance with the no-nonsense Sergeant Calhoun, the true origin of Silverman's character, and an eventual revolt in the world of Sugar Rush. All of it, and I do mean all of it, had me riveted. I will say that, as a fan of old-style video games, I would've preferred seeing the character of Ralph travel to more than just the two different games besides his.

B0073PQ720|5.0|I used to hate Ryan Gosling because my girlfriend won't shut up about him.  The I saw this movie and I now only sort of hate him because this is a pretty darn good movie.

B00A6N8YTU|5.0|I had never heard of this movie before a friend recommended it. Very very gory but definitely worth it! Loved the little twist at the end!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love, love, love.  More episodes, please! Casting director is genius, actors are brilliant.  Having stepped in late to the scene to view, can finally understand the frenzy regarding this series.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Good show if you like others like the Good Wife.  It's catchy from the very beginning and you really like the character development
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never thought I would like a zombie show....but this is great drama!  Everything is life & death and the characters are intense.  You really want to see what happens next for them.
1400069289|5.0|I love books like these. They give us insight to why we do the things we do and help to replace the bad with the good. If you follow the recommendations, you will see improvement in your life.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|It's all so good...the acting, the scenery, the history, the story that supports living outside the box.  A really special movie.  Pattinson as Dali is fantastic.  A beautiful slice of Spanish art/poetry/history.  So very well done.  Don't miss it!
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This was the first thing I read from Wilde and I loved it. He really explores the reaches of society and human entertainment, especially for his time. Fascinating read, and I loved every bit of it.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|This is simply a re-do of what now seems like hundreds of similar themed movies. Even the great skill of Ethan Hawke couldnt resuce this film. If I had it to do over again I would not have rented it and I certainly would not purchase the thing.<br />What has happened to American horror films? How long has it been now since we made a really great, actually scary and well made horror film? It seems that if you want to see a quality horror film you have to turn to the Danes or some of the South American countrys to find one of any quality. The British used to make an occasional good horrow movie but it appears that they are currently too mired in political correctness to risk doing or saying anything new.<br />I wish that the American horror genre would reignite......its been a while now and my hopes are dwindling.<br />I would not recommend renting much less purchasing this film.

B000FC1AGG|4.0|Though a little predictable, it is still a fun read. There is some language in it if that bothers you.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I totally agree with the other reviewers-this game freaked me out!!!!I actually had 7/8 pages and he got me!!!!!Awesome job!: )
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This story has twists and turns and clever ideas. The novel is very well researched, and has a very likable main character. It's a quick read, and while it's not speculative science fiction, it's got great science in it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Can't put it down and i still jump every time I get hit by trains and obstacles. Quick to reload and starts the instant you hit play.
B009CGYO0K|4.0|Nice book gave me a laugh. The Bobby cats was hilarious. Oatmeal forever! I got to go before kittens take over the world.
B001NHNG64|2.0|I really enjoyed the first Jack Reacher book, but I found this one equally dissapointing.  Convoluted plot that i just couldn't buy. Holes in the logic. Situational descriptions that left me bored. A lot of it was just sorta silly. I was glad when it was over.  I'll try the third in the series but will quit it if its not on pace with the first one.
1587613379|3.0|I am currently reading this book. Have liked it so far. I actually thought it was going to be different than what it is.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|Although Follett has long been one of my favorites, I won't be wasting any more time reading his stuff.  It seemed that Follett had great difficulty effectively combining historical narrative with family sagas.  There was inadequate character development and scanty details of actual events.  The intertwining of the main characters' lives was almost comical.  Who would believe that Fitz and Walter would run into each other on a battlefield Maud is running into Ethel in London and that Billy would manage to find Ethel in London just as she is giving birth??!!!  Too unbelievable for me.
0679805273|5.0|It's Dr. Seuss.. Nothing else needed... this will be a graduation gift for my daughter, having each teacher sign along her school career.. hoping it will hold up for lots of years of notes to come.
B005LAII80|4.0|I was not expecting much from this movie, but was pleasantly surprised.  If you want a good futuristic action flick, this is it.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed about this movie was the filming technique, music, and multiple homages to Blade Runner.<br /><br />Visually, the movie is kind of a cross between RoboCop/District 9/ and 300.  there are some scenes where the CGI is overdone to the point where it no longer looks like a movie...or animation from the 1980s...however, these are usually drug-induced &#34;dream-like&#34; sequences, so maybe this was the intent.<br /><br />Substantively, there is not much to this film.  The movie presents a &#34;day in the life of&#34; a &#34;Judge&#34; in megacity one, and a rookie he is tasked with evaluating.  The world depicted is dark, gritty, uncaring, corrupt, and beyond saving.  The Judges try and maintain order, although without any notions of due process.  The accused are adjudged and sentenced on site, and the Judges carry out the punishments---usually death.  Dredd and his rookie get trapped in a mega high rise apartment complex--a &#34;city within a city&#34;--where they do battle with an ex-hooker ganster/drug dealer who has taken over the building and wants the Judges' heads on a platter.  Dredd is a no-emotions, cool operator, who dispenses life sentences based on bad acts with no regard for the mental state or motivation of the guilty.  His sidekick is a telepath, and provides a empathetic &#34;foil&#34; to Dredd's cold nature.<br /><br />The filming does a nice job of presenting a sense of claustrophobia and &#34;no way out&#34;--although you never really fear that the judges will not come out on top.<br /><br />Most of the movie is a standard shoot-em-up, as the Judges first try and escape the building, and then decide to go after the baddie.  There is a small plot twist; but most of the movie is predictable.  What is nice is that the movie avoids most of the usual hollywood cliches of hero saving the planet, getting the girl, etc.  Dredd gets out alive and presumably suits up the next day and does the same thing.<br /><br />So why am I giving it 4 starts?  Visually, the movie is pretty stunning and really &#34;brings&#34; you into the world.  The special effects are pretty good and the Judges have some cool tech they bring along.  The DTS sound is great.  This is not an oscar-type movie....Rather, it is a good  Saturday afternoon popcorn.beer flick.  I was entertained, and will probably watch it again.  They don't make many of these types of movies anymore, and it is a shame because Dredd is just good escapist fun and doesn't pretend to be anything more.

B00A11AN6O|4.0|I like it, it works very well, I needed a way to upload photos from iCloud to Amazon Cloud, it does.
B001GJ9GG8|3.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and thought another look at the movie Catherine Zeta Jones and Sean Connery were perfectly matched. I could not keep my eyes off Catherine and is the only reason I watched it again but second time around was okay. The plot is good and worth watching once.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I was at level 42 and had spent at least $75 on peanuts.  The game crashed, and after several attempts of rebooting my devise I was forced to reinstall the App.  Of course,  it starts over and you cannot reaccess your previous game. All attempts to contact Gameloft fell on deaf ears.  I'll NEVER spend another dime on any App especially a Gameloft App...

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game and how you don't HAVE to purchase jems, that you get to complete in tournaments, but the tounaments are a little easy, i never got below 1st place. and somtimes it wont load.  But mostly one of my greatest apps!<br />,
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a great game for kids and adults. It's simple and fun. I do wish it didn't take so much to compete.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|In addition to these (mine are Made in China), I own a ton of other headphones, from $30 to over $300: Sennheiser HD-600, AKG-K501, Sony MDR-V6 and MDR 7506, Etymotic Research ER6, Koss Porta-Pro, cheaper Sonys and Sennheisers. They sound incredibly good, about as good as the best headphones in their price class. Compared to the MDR 7506 (closed headphones, but similarly priced) these AKGs have crisper and more musical highs but the bass lacks a bit... You will get better sound with the HD-600, but IMO the difference in sound quality does not justify the price difference. The AKG-K501 have similar sound, perhaps a tad more refined mids and highs, but lack bass even more. I found them to be fairly easy to drive by portables, but benefit from amplification. They leak sound a lot so you can't use them at work (unless you have an office...). Together with the K501s they are the most comfortable headphones I own. Currently these headphones have replaced the MDR-7506 as the best bang for the buck in my collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book so much.  If our were to be in the hunger games<br /><br /> I would probably be the victor  I would hunt. I would go into the woods, then wait until the rest of the tributes were gone then I would go get weapons and what I would need to survive.
B00B9366VO|5.0|If you are a musician or if you're into rock music in general this is a great film.  Not only does it tell the story of Sound City, but it provides a lot of cool insight into the bands and people who recorded there and spent their lives there.  Good job Dave!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is one of the best books i have ever read im bout to start on book 2,cant wait to read the whole series!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is the BEST MOVIE I own !!!  Whenever I need a boost or I feel a little down - I watch this movie.  Selfless Service and Impervious Integrity should excite and motivate us all !!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I have been seeing this around the web for months but just now decided to read it - and am I glad I did!  While it does use the formula of get married first then fall in love later, the writing was top notch.  The characters are intelligent and had me rooting for them early on.  I loved the smart dialogue and the responsible way they behaved.  And I was laughing out loud so many times, I disturbed people around me.  My favorite scene was Mandy with the facial mask on -  I read that twice, in hysterics both times!  Loved Mandy, Loved Carter -er - Connor, and loved this book!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Heard the band on the radio. Decided to download the album.  It was a good choice. I enjoy the music. The lead singer's voice reminds me a bit of Freddy Mercury.
B000SEI230|5.0|A walk to remember is a very powerful story that focuses on the importance of dedication, trust, kindness, and ultimately the love in a relationship. Reading this story is so worth it not only for female readers but also for male readers too.
B006CHML4I|5.0|I already own the black face version of this watch and I love it so much that I'm adding the blue face and band to the watch collection. The price point makes multiple purchases of this style an easy decision. If this is your first venture into the automatic watch world, you can expect a well performing, eco friendly watch. BUT.....don't expect perfect time keeping. On average, in a months time, the watch can loose or gain as much as 10 seconds. So if this is an issue, get an atomic clock. This isn't an issue with me, especially at less than $60.00. The Seiko 5 is an attractive casual every day watch that is unobtrusive and always at the ready. Easy to read with contrasting hands and a red tipped second hand. The crown is well positioned to reduce the aggravating shirt catching tendencies that other watches are notorious for yet it is easily accessible for adjusting the date or time without being overly difficult to operate. This being my second of this style should speak for it self. It's a great time piece at a fantastic price and I'm ecstatic that Seiko offers it in so many color choices. Women have their shoes and purses, men have their watches and pocket contents. Add this watch to your collection! You won't be disappointed!
1616550414|5.0|If you've made it far enough along to read reviews for it, you're obviously interested enough to buy it. Much love was poured into this book. You will not be let down. Buy it now.
B000P0J09M|3.0|This is a great movie. Great customer service from the seller. only issue was the movie would not play after a certain scene no matter what device used to play it. I dont blame the seller. I believe it was a manufacturing problem. other than that, on time delivery and great price

B00AECGQF2|1.0|I freaken bought it and it wont install I'm so pissed off. I hate it. I better get it to down load.
B005LAIHCW|2.0|Was excited to see this movie but disappointed after watching it. Why? The actors like Max Thieriot and  Jennifer Lawrence  did a good and convincing Job but the plot somehow disappointed me. I was always waiting for things to develop and to explode in a strike of violence and terror. But this never happened which left me behind a bit disappointed. Nice to watch but the little extra thing is completely missing.
B0091THRCU|1.0|The fit on the iPhone is too tight. Difficult to remove the iPhone out of the case. I also did not like the finishing too much.

0812406273|5.0|I Absolutely loved this book as a child! My favorite story was tear water tea, but they are all great bed time stories. I highly reccomend this book, perfect for ages 4-6, although I must say I am ordering it today just for the great childhood memories it brought me, and I'll share it with my daughter who is 11, but I love this timeless classic and I think she will too.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I liked it but a bit too long. Basically did choose to watch this movie because of the trailler that i saw and the actor which is one of my favorite Hollywood actors.<br />The trailer somehow mislead me, but i wont complain i really enjoyed the movie. Im normally not into Dramas but this one was really catchign all my attention.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|this is the best Cd ever!Bruno...GREAT JOB!I love this sound!Love everything in this CD, Graphic, Music, lyrics even the package, I'm<br />in love with this
B00B2064IY|3.0|This is an album of unfinished work Hendrix was working on at the end of his life.  While the recordings are good, and definitely worth listening to for Hendrix fans, they are not close to the high quality of music that he would want released as his next album, if he were alive.<br /><br />Most of the music here was released shortly after Hendrix's death on the butchered albums \\"War Heroes\\" and \\"Crash Landing\\", in which re-recorded tracks were used instead of original recordings of other musicians, in order to make it sound more polished.  One of the replaced tracks was bass played by Steven Stills (on \\"Somewhere\\").  With digital technology, it is possible to brighten up these recordings without taking the liberties that Alan Douglas and others did in the 70s with Crash Landing and other posthumous releases.<br /><br />\\"Let Me Love You\\" is Jimi playing guitar for Lonnie Youngblood, who is singing; interesting, though not truely a Jimi Hendrix song.  Youngblood also plays saxophone, an instrument we don't hear on Hendrix recordings.  \\"Mojo Man\\" features horn section and Albert Allen on vocals.  You can hear riffs from \\"Hey Joe,\\" \\"Rainy Day,\\" and several other earlier tracks on this album; \\"Hey Gypsy Boy\\" sounds like an early version of \\"Hey  Baby (new rising sun)\\".  \\"Inside Out\\" has riffs that show up on \\"Astro Man\\".<br /><br />For more info, Wikipedia has a decent article on this album, and don't miss their article on Jimi Hendrix.  An interesting note in the article about this album: \\"According to Eddie Kramer. the engineer who recorded most of Hendrix's music during his lifetime, this will be the last Hendrix album to feature unreleased studio material. Kramer said that several as-yet-unreleased live recordings would be available in the coming years.\\"  Go to the first comment on this review for some URLs related to this album, to learn more.<br /><br />This is not an album to hear first, for those who have never heard Jimi Hendrix.  His first three studio albums - Are You Experienced?, Axis: Bold as Love, and Electric Ladyland would be the place to start.  Electric Ladyland will always be my favorite, but the other two are mind-blowing by any standard.  Another posthumous release, \\"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\\", contains nearly finished work that is also among his best (the ones that first appeared on the excellent posthumous album \\"Cry of Love\\").<br /><br />The best of Hendrix' material has already been released.  But for any serious fan or student of Jimi Hendrix, this album is definitely worth a listen.  How could you resist hearing unreleased studio work and well-recorded jams?<br /><br />How to rate an album like this?  As Jimi Hendrix albums go, this is no better than three stars - \\"It's OK\\".  But if you are comparing it to rock albums featuring other guitarists, well, Jimi Hendrix is still one of the best guitarists that ever lived, and if this was the only album he ever released, the guitar playing is still better than most rock guitarists.  After giving it a studied listen, I like it, but don't expect it to listen to it as often as his \\"real\\" albums.  I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if that was possible.Are You Experienced?, Axis: Bold as Love, and Electric Ladyland would be the place to start.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end. It was an eye opening journey about a woman trying to find meaning in her life. It was actually one of the first books I read on my iPad and since then I can't stop reading:)..Don't miss this book. You will not be disappointed!!! I have since found out alot about the author, Cheryl Strayed and from what I can see she is a remarkable woman, even today.

B000002LND|5.0|The Immaculate Collection? It's called is exactly what it is. Anybody that doesn't like this CD should get their hearing checked, before they say, they don't like Madonna.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|From all the rave reviews this book has gotten I thought it would be a fantastic read. Unfortunately, I was let down. I seriously don't understand what people saw in this book. Abbi is the most clueless person ever and whines all the time. She never calls Travis on his BS and lets him criticize her all the time. This book would have been so much better had Abbi been strong. As she was, I just couldn't stand her or understand why Travis would fall madly in love with her. And Travis's pet name for Abbi--pigeon? It was so annoying. This book was just too cheesy to take seriously. Overall, the story was decent. I just wish the characters were more likeable.
B00AX7PGQS|5.0|I just finished watching the movie and the trailer again and like it happens with most movies the trailer completely misleads you. I refuse to use the word \\"weird\\" but \\"Holy Motors\\" is definitely a very different and unusual film, like nothing you have seen before. Definitely it is not a Hollywood product and definitely not a film for big audiences. It is the kind of film that you will actually enjoy much better when you watch it the second time if you like good cinema and enjoy watching them over and over. The story is simple and complicated at the same time. At first and for a while you don't understand what is going on, later you understand what is going on but you will never know why is happening what is happening. It is like an abstract painting that doesn't have an explanation and doesn't necessarily need to be understood or explained, it is just meant to be looked at, enjoyed and everybody will find a different meaning to what they see. Once you are familiar with the story, the second time you watch it you will just enjoy the ride without getting sidetracked trying to figure out what is going on. The movie is indeed slow paced, sometimes there aren't any dialogs at all for long periods of time but it is visually gorgeous, even when apparently there isn't any beauty. It is very well made and has magnificent performances. Whether you love it or you hate it, \\"Holy Motors\\" is a film that will stay in your mind, scrambling your brain. Although the story and the pace turned out to be completely the opposite of what I was expecting from the trailer, I really enjoyed it very much when I watched it. I have only watched it once so far and I cannot take it out of my mind, instead it still keeps growing on me every time I think about it. I eventually would love to own it to watch it over and over!!!

0385523912|5.0|A friend gave me this book and insisted that it was a book I couldn't put down.  My husband got his hands on it first and wouldn't return it until he had finished it.  :)  When I *finally* began reading it, I discovered they were both right--it's a fascinating, compelling, and touching book about life in North Korea.  It is both a description of personal odysseys (the stories of the defectors are varied and each comes to that point differently) and a description of how the government uses the various tools at its disposal to perpetuate the totalitarian regime.  I highly recommend this book, not only as a way to learn more about North Korea but also as an illustration of the strength and resilience of the human spirit.

B0090CVJZ4|4.0|These Amazon Basics 24k gold banana plugs are a very good value.  Using banana plugs is a great way to connect wiring to speakers and amplifiers that accept banana plugs.  They make the speaker connection very secure and easy to remove and replace.  Fundamentally these plugs work the same way as most other brands.  You unscrew the base from the plug, strip your speaker wire, push it through the base and fold a little bit of the wire strands over the top of the base stud, then screw it into the plug.  These plugs make a secure connection, although I have owned better ones that use a small set screw to secure the wire better.  These plugs do have an advantage over others, though, in that you can attach your speaker wire through the hole in the side of the base.  Doing so allows you to piggyback speakers by plugging a second speaker into the base of the banana plug, which allows you to connect two speakers to one speaker output on an amplifier.  Most people would probably never use this feature, but it is something you cannot do with most other brands of banana plug.<br /><br />The main complaint with these plugs, and the reason I docked them a star, is there are no printed instructions that come with them to explain how to use them.  Most people, especially those used to hooking up audio equipment, can figure it out pretty easily.  But even basic instructions should have been included so buyers can make best use of them.<br /><br />If you are in the market for banana plugs, these are of good quality, will make a secure speaker connection, last forever, and cost you much less than most other brands.  Amazon's frustration-free packaging is an added plus as these plugs are packaged in a way that stores them neatly and makes it very easy to access them.  Overall, I definitely recommend them.

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|i have never seen any Columbo ever. then i checked out season one and a movie collection disc from the library. i didnt really think i would make it through the first show and boy was i wrong!!! i watched a show with Jack Cassidy where he is a writing partner and then i watched the next show with Robert Culp and Raymond Miland (not sure if thats spelled correctly) and then i popped in the dvd movie with Faye Dunaway where she has  a thing for Columbo and i am hooked!!! all 3 were excellent and blows anything thats on today's detectives shows that put so much gore, violence, sex, etc and todays shows dont have the 'intrigue' and that 'thrilling' kind of feeling that Columbo has. so after 3 viewings and after reading the excellent reviews on here (thank you for those) and now clicking on to see if i should order and the price is 79.00! so i'm thinking thats a pretty great deal (i could b wrong not sure if the price has been lower) but after the shows i viewed and the reviews i'm hooked and ordering this and will count the days down till it arrives and i have hours n hours of pure viewing pleasure! i am sooooo looking forward to its arrival!! do like me and purchase this set!! you will not b sorry!! peace
0547884591|4.0|I bought the book based upon a radio interview to which I listened.  It was a larger and more entertaining book than I expected.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I read this in the opposite way I usually do in that l saw the movie first.  It is very well written with some interesting and thought provoking views on God and anthropology.  Although that sounds strange, he does an excellent job of relating the two.  I almost never feel this way but I slightly preferred the movie.  Some of the descriptions of what the Pi does to survive detracted from the story rather than added to it, in my opinion.  I found myself skimming large sections.  That is trivial compared to the overall wonderful experience of reading this book.  I highly recommend it.

0812992784|4.0|I was aware of the fatwa, but had no idea that the Iranian government had worked so actively for so many years to try to murderer this man. Opened my eyes to how important it is to defend freedom of expression, especially in the face of demands from religious people who claim a right to not be offended and seek to silence people who disagree with them.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|I purchased this CPU for my aging studio computer. Paired it with an intel DH67 board and found it to be much more than adequate for my needs.<br /><br />Proof?

0316228532|4.0|It took me several chapters to warm up to this book, so many of the characters seemed so unlikable at first, but stick with it, it's worth it.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Loved the movie. Watch it each Christmas. Had to get it for my collection.<br />The kids love it!!!<br />Lots of laughs.
0385536828|4.0|Reminded me of Atonement, in that it plays with the reader's expectations that the narrator is relating events they experienced, and it turns out that that is not strictly true.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Who is the bad guy? Throughout the book, new aspects of the characters personalities are revealed. The author captures the intricate characteristics of the characters. A great read!
B00BESM14U|2.0|The high reviews encouraged me to watch this but I gotta say, it was really boring. Slow, unexciting, predictable. Snooze-fest in my opinion. Unless you are a cinema buff and admire cinematography and acting, stay away. This is not the movie for those who want to get lost in an exciting film.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|I have read all of Connelly's books and always enjoy them.  He writes about areas in Southern California with which I am familiar and it always makes for more interesting reading.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in World War II.  It tells the true story of two pilots, an American bomber pilot and a German ace fighter pilot, and how their paths crossed one day, leading to a reunion forty-six years later.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Super fun especially since they're on world tour they've been in Rio and now Rome  this is something you need!!!

B008TMA1LY|4.0|After level 3, you need more staff. I caved and shelled over 10 bucks...I haven't needed to spend more than that and now have 6 helpers. If you let kids play, make sure you put the parental lock on so you don't get a surprise. It's just a click to buy points.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm only halfway through but I like it so far! Everyone says that they hate the 3rd but so far I like it.

B005LAIIFS|5.0|I saw this movies trailer and it sounded and looked good. When i finally saw it in theaters i was shocked at how awsome it is. I love how the characters are like one big happy family. Its funny and awsome. I would recommending this movie to many. I just hope they make a 2nd one now.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great game for those who can appreciate puzzles.  the game will make you think and keep you engaged. I have enjoyed playing.
B00AU15HPC|2.0|As a first-generation fan of the Moody Blues, I am obviously a huge fan of Justin Hayward.  His incredible vocal prowess and underrated guitar skills make him a musical genious to me, but I can't help but feel this is a lackluster effort.  The soaring vocals and the wailing of his Gibson ES355 are hardly to be found on this offering, and I won't even go into the mutant abarrations of his classic song \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\\" found at the end of this album.  Justin:  Where is the man who sang \\"New Horizons?\\"  Where is the man who sang \\"Night, Winters, Years,\\" on Blue Jays....?? Where is the man who sang \\"Forever Autumn..?\\"At least give me the man who did \\"A View From the Hill..!!\\"...Not this sleepy, lackluster, tame output. I can take ballads just fine, but this is lame my friend.  My suggestion..Get in the studio with John Lodge and/or the rest of the guys and make some rock and roll..!! You can do it...!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I really enjoyed this show! I only wish ther were more episodes. I can't wait to see what the next season brings.

B001K3JF7K|4.0|Another wonderful, smooth and classy offering from this great artist, and a fine quality product.  For any lover of Diana's work, this is a winner!
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|Here on People, Hell & Angels, a posthumous release of studio material that had been under consideration for both Electric Ladyland and its followup, has been presented as a time capsule of sorts ... mostly with Buddy Miles and Billy Cox, is totally free of overdubs, and comes at you like a bolt of lightening, splitting the sky, and knocking you back with rolling thunder.  While most of this material has surfaced at other times, it's still great to hear it gathered together in one place ... heaping helpings of smokin' incendiary funky electric soul.  And if you think you've heard funky electric soul before, just wrap your ears around Lonnie Youngblood's staggering vocals, and tell me \\"Let Me Move You\\" doesn't sound as fresh and futuristic as it did back in 1968 and '69.  With \\"Easy Blues\\" cooking like a more upbeat, less stoned \\"Rainy Day,\\" floating easy, and swaggering with a passion and style that's pure Hendrix at his very best.<br /><br />This material is far more than cutting room floor gatherings, this is a solid album that's worthy of anything Hendix ever rained down on us ... leaving me staggered for what I'm missing due to his untimely death.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Disappointed in this game.  I installed it and it wouldn't open. I even reinstalled it and the game keeps crashing. Kindle Fire.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great read. The characters are interesting and compelling. Set I ASK is amazing to read. Nice to learn some good history.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this series of stories. The pacing in  the first stories works well and reveals the highly developed fiction nicely. You're better off going in cold, so read as little as possible about Wool. Lastly, many books botch the ending but Wool doesn't rush or force the ending.<br /><br />Worth your time.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|the movie has great CG, couple that with my LG 3D TV and the picture can't be beat. My kids have to duck and cover when the flying scenes are playing.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I thought that the movie portrayed the sensual side of sex very well. The actors were amazing in their roles. Both Hawkes and Hunt should be greatly credited with their performances. An inspiring and moving story along the path of life, intimacy, and the search to explore all of the human experiences.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This movie humbled me - it is wonderful, I knew the music well as I was in South Africa at that time.<br />I have watched it three times.

B008XBCJ34|1.0|Very unhappy.  I was expecting a really good 3D experience on my 55&#34; Samsung 3D Smart Led TV and found the 3D effects did not work at all.  It is my understanding that this movie was created for a promotion of the Panasonic 3D TV and if you don't have a Panasonic you are ourt of luck.  You would think there is a compatibility list out there but I have not found it yet.  I don't understand how a manufacturer can expect to charge you more for the 3D movie and not claim on the Box what the compatibility issue might be.  I am sure they know.  Sounds like a class action lawsuit to me.  Buyer beware ... do your research, that is, if you can even find anyhing.
034580404X|5.0|it is a wonderful love story that touches your heart. watching the evolution of grey is emotional and heartbreaking. the story stays with you.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars because...well who wouldn't want Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt looking at you the way they would in this movie...and it's long enough to really relax and enjoy it for a good while.  Ann Price is an excellent author and this movie is from her book.  total thumbs up on this purchase and it was an used movie but i don't mind used items from Amazon...as far as i'm concerned, a little scratch or ding here or there just adds character...:)
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I am a big Star Wars fan. But, haven't had money to buy a new set since Special Edition Trilogy. I finally got this Set, as it seemed like a good Saga Set (at least until the 9 movie Saga comes out in 15 years or so). I am quite disappointed with the extras on each movie disc, Sluggish and unexciting menus. The movies seem fine, and I haven't got to the bonus disc, which I am saving for when I have time to watch it. Anyways, that's my thoughts.
B0057J72OG|4.0|The pressing is of average quality. No excessive skipping but the record itself could be higher quality. The cover art and liner are very plain.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I love it. but it keeps messing up. i can only play if i nevrr want to play another game again. if i want to play it i tap on it and wait and th3 after a while it goes back to home screen!!
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love this calcuator!  It's a simple everyday tool that does just what I need.  No over the top bells &amp; whistles to complicate things.  The buttons are large  enough to see and to hit without overlap error. I had three on my kindle, but deleted the other two and kept this one.  I don't care to try any other as this is a perfect fit for me.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book (so far, I am halfway through) follows right along with the first four books. It is well written, exciting and fills you in on details from every character.

B00BFUC8RC|5.0|fun for me and kids. warning as it is addictive. got free tokens sharing on fb so didnt need spend real money.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Excellent writing and character development.  The actors are very good.  This series is convincing.  I started watching the original BBC series.  It is so far more subtle in a way Americans often are not.  That's fine.  We are different.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey  is devilishly good in this role.  Robin Wright is a little like Lady Macbeth, but she is also conflicted.  She is very much into power, but she also wants a legacy of doing good.  Spacey's character would also say that he wanted to do good, but it is really only incidental to consolidating his power.<br /><br />All of the other actors are also very good.  This is among the finest televisions series' that I have ever seen.  I very much cannot wait to see season two, but I would not be surprised it it took at least one year to complete.
1616550414|5.0|The Legend of Zelda series has entertained and inspired me since my childhood.  This book walks the reader through the entire series, and gives priceless insight into the 2D design facet of the production pipeline that went into each game. There is, needless to say, a huge volume of work. If any buyer is lucky enough to get the same amazing deals offered early in this books release, purchase it!! This is one of the best buys available.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I you are a Josh Groban fan All That Echoes does not not disappoint.  I give the album 5 stars. A must buy.
1933492279|5.0|This book is filled with excellent hard surface designs from cover to cover. From thumbnailing to final design Daniel Simon shows a great design process and many neat little tricks to help pop that final design into feeling like it could really exist in our world. I highly recommend it for any entertainment or industrial designers.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's ok<br />this app is ok but you need gems to buy all the really good stuff. otherwise it's a good game.
B00351YF52|5.0|As usual a great read. Well done John Grisham. Had me wanting to keep reading to find out what was going to happen next.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This show just began this past season and it is a really exciting, edge of your seat experience.  Kevin Bacon is terrific as the lead in this drama.  He is also surrounded by other excellent actors.  If you want to watch a show that is full of twists and turns then be sure to watch this.<br />Is this person a good person or not----just wait and see! I love this show!!!!!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|It would be nice if there was a quick primer or chart, of background info to keep track of all the names and such. Maybe there is, somewhere. (Yeah, I should probably know all this after one entire season.) For this season (Season 2), I've only seen the first episode. Based on that, I can safely say this show is still a notch above most television programs. It remains solid.
B000W9399S|5.0|A very interesting concept and unique story. I was looking for something different and this was it. I will be reading the rest of the series.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|First time playing Montezuma games and am finding it fun! You can choose the difficulty level and the goals and rewards are interesting along the way. I think any Match 3 fan would enjoy this game!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|this lovely film blends the joy of young love with the sadness of love faded - the usual collection of sharply-drawn Wes Anderson characters in various stages of love. Moments of sheer delight in the settings, genuineness of dialog, and music. The little pauses and silences Anderson uses in his scripts allow those moments to shine as characters pause to process something they've seen or just been told; few others capture the way that children observe the world like this fine director.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It's fun and it really makes you think. This is the kind of game that you will not be able to out down, so be prepared !!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A lot went on here that I was waiting to happen.  This book will keep you up late at night as you want to read more.

1451626657|5.0|The book is a masterpiece!! and in saying that I would only be reiterating the most commonly held notion about this book. As insane the humor is, as sane and grave the authors purport. The story unfolds the tale of Captain John Yossarian, an American bombardier of Assyrian heritage based in Italy during World War II, who is desperately trying to keep himself alive caught between the enemy and the sinister unwritten law of Catch 22! Catch 22 states that a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes the necessary formal request to be relieved of such missions, the very act of making the request proves that he is sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved. The book is credited with having lent its title, Catch 22, to the English lexicon commonly used to describe a no win situation. The protagonist and the other characters, the conversations and the situations have been etched out in the most bizarrely satirical way by the author. The dilemma of staying sane and keeping alive in a murderously insane world has been presented. Yossarian's exploits are considered to be based on the experiences of the author as Heller himself was also a bombardier in the Army Air Forces, stationed on an island off the coast of Italy during World War II. A brilliant piece of work that verily deserves all the praises and plaudits heaped on it.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Great movie. Family fun movie. Very inspiring about friendship, honesty, locality, and how dogs are magnificent animals. I highly recommend this film
B008220DIC|5.0|this was the best picture of the year by far. . . . . . . . . . .
B00BHASVQC|5.0|I'm a diehard GoT fan although I've not read all the books in the series (I finished the first three and haven't continued beyond that). I love the HBO series which I find to be the perfect culmination of excellent casting and plot, beautiful sets and cinematography, and a haunting score.<br />Since I don't subscribe to HBO, I waited almost a year for this series to be made available on DVD and I think it is worth all the wait.<br /><br />Season 2 picks up where Season 1 left off, with political turmoil within the Seven Kingdoms being the backdrop. With regards to the books, this season dramatizes the events found in the second book of the series, i.e. A Clash of Kings (HBO Tie-in Edition): A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two. One thing I have to mention here is that the series is not 100% faithful to the books but certainly worth appreciating on its own merits. I love the series for its strengths, independent of the novels. The series is to be commended for being able to capture the complexity of the inter-connected story lines, a spider's web of court intrigues, supernatural machinations, romance, and adventure, all of which commingle to provide viewers with one of the best small screen experiences ever. I consider GoT to the be one of the best TV series I've ever watched and certainly ranks as my all time favorite fantasy series.<br /><br />Btw, for those (like me) who like to develop a better understanding of all the characters and their specific roles in the stories, then there are several sites that do a good job of providing all the relevant background information -<br />awoiaf dot westeros dot org<br />gameofthrones dot wikia dot com<br /><br />The boxed set DVD for the Second Season comes in an attractive package. The five DVDs (containing two episodes each) come packaged in a box that folds out to reveal all five DVDs. The DVD carry case features the faces of several main characters such as Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) who is a central character this season, playing the King's Hand, the manipulative Queen Regent Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) who is being held captive by Robb Stark's army, Robb Stark (Richard Madden) who is enmeshed in an active military campaign against the Lannisters, and the beautiful Khaleesi, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke).<br /><br />The boxed set comes with an Episode Guide which folds out to reveal a map of the Seven Kingdoms. The episodes in Season 2 are:<br /><br />Episode One - The North Remembers<br />Episode Two - The Night Lands<br />Episode Three - What is Dead May Never Die<br />Episode Four - Garden of Bones<br />Episode Five - The Ghost of Harrenhal<br />Episode Six - The Old Gods and the New<br />Episode Seven - A Man without Honor<br />Episode Eight - The Prince of Winterfell<br />Episode Nine - Blackwater<br />Episode Ten - Valar Morghulis<br /><br />The bonus features are:<br />Character Profiles (Disc One) - featuring 7 new profiles of Renly and Stannis Baratheon, Robb Stark, Theon Greyjoy, etc.<br /><br />Creating the Battle of Blackwater Bay (Disc 5) - this provides an in-depth look at how the battle was dramatized<br /><br />Game of Thrones: Inner Circle (Disc 5) - showcases interviews with actors Emilia Clarke(Daenerys), Kit Harington (Jon Snow), Lena Headey (Cersei), Michelle Fairley (Lady Catelyn Stark), Liam Cunningham (Davos Seaworth). The format is a roundtable discussion, with David Benioff and D.B. Weiss as moderators.<br /><br />The Religions of Westeros (Disc 5) - a discussion of the various religions in the story by author George R.R. Martin, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss.<br /><br />Audio Commentaries (Discs 1-5) - 12 commentaries with cast and crew<br /><br />There's also a GoT trading card included. Mine featured The White Walker. The total running time on the DVDs is 545 minutes. The DVDs come with the option of English, French, Latin Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Complex Chinese, Korean, and Thai subtitles.<br /><br />I did not purchase the Blu-Ray edition but I am immensely satisfied with this DVD set - the images are crisp and clear, the audio is excellent, and I have no complaints.<br />I did not purchase the Blu-Ray edition but I am immensely satisfied with this DVD set - the images are crisp and clear, the audio is excellent, and I have no complaints.

B0002W18MU|5.0|In the end, that's what this album comes down to, it's a man who made his peace with God and was ready to go, reflecting on his regrets one last time, while also looking ahead and what awaits him at his journey's end. Despite how tired and old he sounds, his voice is still full of power and emotion. It's like he doesn't just sing every word, he feels it. I really don't know what to say past that It's just a album you have to hear and feel for yourself.<br /><br />It seems fitting that the last song, on his last album, was a re-recording of \\"Free From the Chain Gang Now\\"

B001ANSSDC|4.0|Very well written book and entertaining story. The characters were well developed and you felt like you really got to know them
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I like that her characters are not necessarily easy to like but you root for them. I enjoyed this more than Gone Girl perhaps because it was more realistic. Great writer who this KC girl loves to read.<br />.
B004LROUW2|4.0|Held my interest, but the ending was a let down.  No info about the Little People. Ending was lack luster.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I jusy hated to see the book end. I think a sequel might be great. Can'twsit to see the movie.
B008S80OU2|4.0|After listening to this 'BOC' box set disc by disc it is truly amazing what this band accomplished. Though I am a big fan of the first 9 C.D.'z (excluding 'Some Enchanted Evening, both C.D. and DVD) so basically up to 'Fire of...Origin', This time around I have finally heard it all. Killer music! The remasters of everything passed 'Spectres' are way cool. Why they stopped after 'Godzilla' is ??????? but now I am fully satisfied. I would say &#34;buy this box set&#34; to any BOC fan. The only reason I did not give this reveiw 5 stars is because I personally feel the band lost a step after 'Fire of Unknown Origin'. Worth every penny even for a half catalog lover.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game!!! Good fun, addictive, constantly updated but not too quickly... overall justa great game overall it is a 10 / 10. From me
B00846REIS|5.0|This book has had a lot of speculation of being a remake of 50 shades. There are significant similarities but it is different. Very good book can't wait to read the next one!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|There are so many photo editing apps to choose from and, for me it got SO frustrating trying to find one that I really liked!!! Finally, I came across PicsArt...it had all of the features I was looking for, and it was free!!! ME + PICSART=GREATEST PICS EVER!!!
B008476HBM|5.0|Pride and Prejudice was real written and pulls the reader into the plot. The characters become like old friends and I felt sad to leave them when the book was finished.
B0006VBFM0|4.0|Me gusto mucho , es sencillo y practico y los colores son muy bonitos. es una buena marca y tiene mucho estilo
B004XQYBA2|4.0|There are different levels and many games in each of the levels so lots of playing time for the family.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|A Storm of Swords is as well-written as the first two books in George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire, but this one left me feeling unsettled after finishing it. The story picks up immediately where A Clash of Kings ended. Robb Stark remains the King of the North, but his decision to marry another woman threatens to undo his alliance with the Freys. Catelyn is so concerned about her daughters that she’s willing to ransom the Kingslayer for their safe return (this development introduces Jamie Lannister as a viewpoint character for the first time). Sansa remains Cersei’s hostage, while Arya has escaped from Harrenhal, hoping to find her way back to Robb. Meanwhile, Jon is with the wildlings beyond the wall, Daenerys and her dragons are still far away in the east, Tyrion lies in bed recovering from the attack on his life, and his ruthless father becomes the Hand of the King.<br /><br />Even more than in the prior two novels, nothing works out the way you’d expect in A Storm of Swords. I counted no less than four major plot twists, and there’s a shocking body count as far a major characters are concerned. Martin is almost fiendish with the turmoil he put his characters through, and every time you think a character is safe or making some progress toward his or her goals, Martin changes the game, often in brutal and unexpected ways. I believe this is what left me so unsettled. One twist near the middle of the story was so jaw dropping that I never felt the same about the book the rest of the way. Of course, this is one of Martin’s gifts: creating characters that the reader truly cares about. And when something awful happens to some of them, I found myself more emotionally drained than I ever expected with this novel. Still, I was unable to put this book down, and the more harrowing events became, the more I kept reading, sleep be damned.<br /><br />The brightest storyline belongs to Daenerys. Martin has handled her character arc from the first novel to this one brilliantly, and she is fast becoming my favorite character in this series. I didn’t think I’d root for a Targaryen to rule Westeros, but I am now – at least until Martin throws yet another unexpected twist into this tale, which might change my perspective entirely. I highly recommend A Storm of Swords, but be prepared to be taken for a rather harrowing ride.is one brilliantly, and she is fast becoming my favorite character in this series.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I enjoyed the book and found it current in content.  However i also found it very technical, and therefore sometimes hard to follow.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love everything about this book.  It's well written, it's a great story, it got me invested in the characters, and I didn't want it to end.  I really appreciate what the author did with the title of this book.  Discovering the significance of the title and finding out that it's not at all what I expected it would mean was a very cool aspect of this book.  That in itself is a great reason to read it.
B000SW2F6M|5.0|I felt like I was there - totally captivating movie - great cast and a brilliant screenplay - Liam Neeson, Orlando Blloom, Eva Green<br /><br /> Balian of Ibelin travels to Jerusalem during the crusades of the 12th century, and there he finds himself as the defender of the city and its people.<br /><br />Director:<br />Ridley Scott<br />Writer:<br />William Monahan<br />Stars:<br />Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Liam Neeson
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|I read the blurb and thought it was the dumbest idea I'd ever heard.  Then after finishing another series I loved and looking for something else to read I decided to give it a chance and read the sample which I loved. I felt it was horribly overpriced for an eBook but I had the need to see what came next so I bought it anyway.  There were two separate occasions when I was afraid I was going to be disappointed and was kicking myself for paying so much for it but the story did recover.  The characters are somewhat likable.  Hana is a typical spoiled, beautiful, rich girl unable to understand why her lower class best friend is jealous of what she has.  Lena is your typical teenage girl who has a low self-esteem and no reason to not believe everything she is told until she finds herself in circumstances that make her feel differently. I liked the story but I didn't love it.  I bought the second one because I wanted to see what happens next but I just \\"liked it\\".  I don't love it.  That is why I'm giving it 3 stars.
B008220C38|1.0|I will admit from the start that I could only get through the first thirty five minutes, and I do this for a living! I have actually read the book (and I'm not just saying this to pretend I'm Oprah!), and I've seen every film version. This is just plain weird! It's like a film within a film within - I don't know what! I thought I was having a stroke in installments! I have never seen Russian peasants dance while they serve tea! The soaringly beautiful music completely drowned out the actor's voices - this was a good thing. Speaking of actors, they suddenly stop moving and pose, as if to model the gorgeous costumes - I think the director already knew he had a train wreck on his hands and thought the only way to get an &#34;Academy Award&#34; nomination was for &#34;Best Costume Design&#34; - he was right. If you enjoy Baz Lurhman's &#34;Moulin Rouge&#34; and getting stoned on absinthe, try this version of &#34;Anna Karenina,&#34; it's absolutely made for you!

0451228375|3.0|This was ordered as a gift, was delivere on time,<br />this is a easy reading book, with lots of excitement.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love the twist although it seemed kinda predictable but I didn't care. The writer was fast paced and got to the point. None of this I'm gonna explain a scene and take up 5 pages to do it. No right to it just how I like it. This is a must read!! Read it within 2 or 3 days and can't stop thinking about it.
1585104205|5.0|I have tried many different titles for learning various languages over the years, and lingua latina is by the best. It employs the natural learning method so that everything is in latin and slowly gets more complicated as you progress. It is set up ingeniously: the vocabulary and grammar are introduced gradually, at natural points in the narrative, and then are repeated in various ways to make you familiar with the operations of the language without having to consciously parse it. The story is actually quite engaging and amusing too.<br /><br />One has to engage regularly with the book otherwise you can quickly lose the thread, but this is a peril of all language learning. I would recommend supplementing the book with a good latin/english dictionary to get the precise meanings of the words, and if you are like me, you might at some point want to get a volume which covers the grammar more comprehensively, say Wheelock's Latin. But you can't go past this book as the basis for learning latin.
0743270754|5.0|It's really unnecessary to add more words of praise for this work, but I feel compelled to put in my two cents anyway.  This is a wonderful work.  Whatever your particular opinon of Lincoln is you will carryaway one central fact: he was a remarkable man.  As history this book is well-researched and well-thought out,b ut it's as a piece of writing that I want to concentrate on.  This is a history book that is written with the skil, though, feeling of a great novel.  It reads like a great novel, with suspense and thrills and emotional impact. The story has a great cast of characters and they are all fleshed out.  The pacing is good--it's hard to put it down though it is a big book--and you may find yourself weeping at the end.  Don't be ashamed.<br /><br />Ms. Goodman is a marvelous writer and this book is the best of its type I have ever read.  Don't be shy because of its size and is label.  This is a wonderful reading experience.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|this was a really intetesting movie alot of color and I would recommend it for family movie night for all
B000VDDWDS|5.0|The ships, the acting, the drama its all there.  One great movie that shows the true nature of the navies of yesterday.  Great movie if you haven't seen it by now. Buy this Blu-ray!!!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|My little 7yr old brother loved this movie and I thought I'd buy it to keep him entertained while I cleaned. Well I never even started cleaning. It's a really good movie that keeps you entertained throughout and has a good message without being preachy. Plain and simple, it was a good buy

B002HK9IDQ|2.0|Just purchased this DVD for the family (we love musicals!) and believe it or not, there are ZERO English subtitles.  Only Brazilian Portugese to choose from.  I actually need the subtitles as I miss much of the dialogue otherwise... There is no error with the disc - as it is stated above that the subtitles are in Portuguese - but WHY?? And why no English.<br />It is for sale in the US and Canada only - is this common ?I have never had to ensure my subtitles were in English before (and I usually get a choice of several languages - not just one that serves a South American country where this movie can't even be legally sold...)<br />Loved  the movie - just wish I could see all the words..
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|I'm not sure how I feel about this app yet. I've just been introduced to LinkedIn in the last few weeks. Seems to be good.
B0016492BW|3.0|Regular calidad de video, creo q no pudieron remasterizar más ese video de años de filmación, la trama es excelente con humor negro y a veces absurdo, me hubiese gustado tenerlo con audio en español (latino) por la primera experiencia viendo ese video hace como 15 años atrás. De todas maneras es muy recomendable.
B00124BNF4|5.0|IT'S THE TALKING HEADS!!!!! A great collection of there well known material. A great collection for even the most die-hard fan.
B000OPPBEQ|3.0|Desde la primera vista, la caja del video tiene muy buena calidad, al ver la calidad de video es impresionante, hay tanto material extra q aun no termino de verlo, lo malo lamentablemente es el argumento q no me gusto (de la última película, con un final tonto q deja mucho que desear)
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|I thought I would give this movie a go, totally different that I though it would be.  Takes a while to understand the plot, but she makes it work..
B003UESJH4|3.0|I knew the story already so I liked it because of the history and fond memories of that period of the monarchy.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This app started out great but it started messing up when opened and there was a &quot;fake welcome page&quot; thing that kept coming up. I lost everything. Before that i planned to give it 5 stars.
0525952926|5.0|Maybe it's because I grew up in England and learned a lot of European history in school, and Ken Follett is such an excellent writer, that i feel like i am right there experiencing the highs and lows of these fellow human beings who had to endure so much.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very nice book....well written. This book is a quick and easy read.  Remember the book is always better then the movie!!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I made the mistake of seeing the movie which completely change the father and brother position.  The book was better but how a book end is very important.  I felt this one ending somewhat flat.
0307592731|5.0|Have done a little backpacking late in life.  I say little after reading this inspirational book.  It was absolutely fascinating to see Cheryl solve what seemed like insurmountable obstacles to succeed in her endeavor.  Always wonderful to see how one can turn their life around and experience healing and a rewarding life after such a poor start.  Hats off to Cheryl.
0385737955|2.0|I picked up The Maze Runner because it was recommended to me. I thought the concept could have been really great, but the execution wasn't. I didn't feel anything for the main characters. I actually thought the secondary characters were much more interesting. I struggled through the book hoping that the end would at least make some sense of the journey, but it did not. This will be the first time I have read the first book of a series and not read the others.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|It was thrilling and awesome ,I loved the ending ,however ridley and link were meant for each other and if they don't realise that in the next book I WILL die!!!
B00637D114|5.0|I loved this movie. The graphics are great. I did not pay more for the HD version and I dont feel like I am missing much... I think HD is overrated. Its very bright colored and great quality film. I have a 47&#34; vizio and it looks great.

B007L6VR12|5.0|would rate this movie poor. bad acting and the plot was slow and dull. no story line and tuened it off b/c too dull.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|great movie would reccomend if you like action/ super heros. I would also recomend iron man, green laturn, iron man 2
B007SPPANM|5.0|Classic Movie tha was a must be for the famly library. Great actors and the bewitching plot line keep you engrossed in the movie.
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|Although a more mature reader, I thoroughly enjoyed this young adult book. Roy Huff was able to draw me into the story from the start and I was anxious to see what was going to happen next. Strong imagination and great descriptions of the other realm. Think this would make a great movie.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Bought this movie for my niece, but whqt I saw of it , it is definitley not one that any middleaged adults would really want to watch. flat in places and the story line somewhat boring.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Its winter and cold.  Love to read, buy pretty typical Nick Sparks book.  Enjoyed anyways.  It was spring and summer in the novel.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|its the most great game in the world...after animal jam (Wichita is a computer game) so I guess best KINDLE game...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun amazing educational game for kids or adults. This game is my favorite game ever. I love this game. I believe every one should play this game at least once in their life time.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Although this is a novel, it reads like non-fiction.  It's a first person narrative by a brilliant, Harvard psychology professor who specializes in linguistics.  She has a few strange memory lapses, goes to her internist to see if the lapses are hormonal because she's entering menopause at 50.  Unfortunately, after a few tests and a visit to a neurologist, she discovers that she has early onset Alzheimer's disease.  Following the workings of Alice's mind and seeing the interactions with and responses from her husband, three young adult children her son-in-law, and her colleagues as her disease progresses is instructive and extremely moving.  It's really hard to believe that this is a novel as the characters come across as very real.  The relationships all seem true-to-life.  I would highly recommend this book even though I sobbed through much of it.  Also, my book club really loved it as well.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Enchanting book that makes you question does magic truly exist and are we just not in tune with it during our everyday lives.  Enjoyed the multiple story lines that continued to develop throughout the book.
B002BWP49M|3.0|Better than the other twilight movies, but I am not much of a chick-flick person. However I loved Breaking Dawn Part 2 and it is neccessary to have Part 1 if I own Part 2.<br /><br />Still a major fan of the books though.
B0018AO9T4|2.0|I enjoy this group's music but this album is definitely not one of their better albums.  The audio quality of the live performances is not great and most of the time Jim sounds clearly out of it (which he was in those days).
B00340ESIS|1.0|Formulaic garbage. If you want to write a movie on par with &#34;Legally Blonde&#34; or &#34;Miss Congeniality&#34; (or the Authors own &#34;Stop, or My Mom Will Shoot&#34;, god forbid), then this might be a decent read for you. Between his hate for &#34;Memento&#34; (because it didn't follow a set mold) and his bizarre love for &#34;4 Christmases&#34; and &#34;Legally Blonde&#34;, this book offers nothing more than a generic template on boring script writing and insults towards writers who step outside of the box. The author does not encourage (and in fact bashes) ingenuity in writing, or attempting to elevate what you are doing into anything unique. If you have a creative bone in your body, and want to showcase anything original, then this book is not for you.
1610660242|4.0|have not finished it but it is a very entertaining read.  How does the son of Asian immigrants come up with a success story that brings honor to his immigrant parents and also makes him a business icon and model for someone who is seeking happiness over monetary success?

B007L6VR12|5.0|Wasn't quite sure the first time we watched it, we have now watched it three times and each time it seems to get better.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Very basic boy meets girl story. It would be no different from a less than average love story. All it had going for it were the sex scenes which I found boring.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I started reading this book I thought to myself that it wasn't going to be as good as her last two I had read.  Oh, I was so WRONG..... This is another powerful and emotional book from Colleen Hoover.  Her writing is so exceptional that she makes you feel like you are there in the place with them. How does she do that?  It's talent and I can't wait until her next book....<br /><br />I know I haven't told much about the story, but I don't want to say much afraid I will give the plot away and it's something that you should read instead of learning about it in a review.  So please just take the time to read this book, and I bet you will be glad you did...
B0083ZRAJS|1.0|Best book ever I<br />loved and I'm only like 9 you guys are awesome I hope one day you will have fame and fortune and don't forget to make more because I'm your number one fan now.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its cute. Like stepping back in time for some of these games! My friends kids played for hours. I dont think ive played every single game yet either!
B000GBEWHA|2.0|The only reason this gets two stars is because I love this movie. The pictures show the movie comes with a mini leather. IT DOES NOT!!! They  charged me $10 for a $5 movie else where.
B005P68PSI|5.0|I love supernatural! This is the first time I have ever purchased an episode in this manner and I would do it again if my dvr ever fails again.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|If you watched aliens then you will like this movie. You may have to watch the old ALIEN'S movies first then this movie to catch the benefits of this movie. Otherwise you might get board.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|An extraordinary story, beautifully told.  I loved everything about this book!  Not much of a review but a heartfelt sentiment nonetheless.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is a great movie. For us kids who grew up with comic books and far away from digital technology this movie brings childhood fantasy to life with a great cast.
B006WQLH7G|3.0|Good app, but some of the important features requires a rooted Android device to work. The firewall feature is one of the features that requires a rooted device.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Look if you like family guy or ben stiller movies this is a must see. Do not be fooled by the bear it is not a kids movie.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I chose the Expendables because I had seen it in the movies and I wanted the video for my collection.  As a fan, I thought the movie<br />was great.  It had a lot of blowing up stuff and great special effects.  It also showed that he had a softer side to him and it made<br />him very believable.  As I said, I am a Stallone fan and I enjoy anything he is in.  I even loved Rhinestone.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I like the premise and definitely makes you want to see the second part. The second part just came out and I am waiting for rental rather than paying for the movie. If you like batman, it's worth watching.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I am a 100% Stallone fan and i have almost every movie he was ever in  This one is pure STALLONE.  Action packed and full of<br />energy.  It also had a little &#34;tongue in cheek&#34; humor in it which I thought was great.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes<br />Stallone or action movies.<br />I don't like all the futuristic stuff and weird characters.  I know with Stallone you know the type of movie you are going to get and<br />I like it that way.  Good viewing.
B004S3MB2U|3.0|I use calculators on a regular basis, have a collection of scientific and graphing calculators at home, and have tried MANY calculator apps. It feels like one of the many TI scientific calculators, and does a decent job at that. What shocked me was the regular price of $9.99, when Droid48 blows it out of the water at a daily price of free. It's a decent FAOTD, but I would never consider paying full price for it.

At 32 I decided it was time for a change. YAYOG is a perfect for for me, and I know as the program progresses it will help me become perfectly fit.<br /><br />After doing the program for four weeks, I've already lost 1.5 inches around my middle. My strength is also greatly improving. Hats off the Mark Lauren and the men and women in our armed services.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Like the entertainment part of this app, Video is awesome and sound is great. Nice gift idea's for everyone here.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|While the book was good, it was too wordy.  Like Tom Clancy's works, a good editor should have been able to eliminate 20-30 percent without losing much.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Quality was fuzzy at first but eventually got better, and the other thing was the audio was kind of low but it didn't bother me too much.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love, love, love this game. keep up the good work. the only thing i wish is that you would get more coins.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|While reading scorpia rising, I could literally feel my heart beat faster and faster as Alex embarked on his last ever mission. I couldn't put the book down and I really think that there wouldn't be any book that could possibly be a better book to complete the Alex Rider series. As sad as I am that they are over, I am really happy that this was the last book because there couldn't be a better last book. I really loved this book.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|I could have handled this at five. I loved horror films so much. And I still do. I would sneak and watch them even at that age. Still most kids that young will not be able to  handle this one. It's a horror movie for the younger set. some 7++ year olds should be fine with this flick. At least some of them! This is pretty good film , but it's not a sweet movie for the kiddies. It's more of a horror fans kids movie!. And that's the truth.  the effects are great and the 3d is fantastic but it's not for eveyrone. And parents , if you kid doesn't like horror movies like I did at a young age , you should wait until they are older to watch it.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|liked it and it was an easy read, I look forward to seeing it in movie form.....although I can't see it as a &#34;G&#34; rating
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Great story that brings together divergent incomplete (to this point) story lines. Engrossed me to the point of missing my bus stop.  :)
B0092YO8C6|5.0|I really love Austin&Ally! I watch it all the time, it is my favorite show, I also like his songs.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I am surprised they made a movie of this book.  Not my cup of tea.  Ya Ya sisterhood was much better.  So many better books out there.  QUICK READ
B001G70M6S|5.0|I purchased this film to use with my Polaroid Land camera. The pictures were super sharp. I could not be happier.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I needed a case for my Kindle Fire that I could rely on and this one is the ticket. The front flap can easily fold back making playing games easier, and the elastics that hold it in place don't slip. Someone even asked me why I brought a book to the gym, and then I showed her it was my Kindle. I love having a case that makes my Kindle, something I use to read. with an actual book.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Why didn't the car cross the tracks....,,,.only Jack knows.<br />The start of a long road for Reacher....,,not always lonely.<br />Has the potential to be a classic start for Jack R.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love the Harry Potter series. And this one completed my set. I was happy to get it cheaper than at the store and it is just as good quality.
B00BHMEALA|4.0|This is a good quality of picture and sound, best movie I ever seen for a while...I like ben afflect
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I got just what I wanted, it played really well. I have all of the movies and books in the series now.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was so happy to see you had this available.  I've just gotten interested in the series and Netflix only had the first season.
0307346609|4.0|Max Brooks puts together an easy reading collection of stories of life after the Zombie War. It was a good read, perhaps not something I'll read again, but good enough to make me curious about the forthcoming film. Occasionally graphic, but not disturbingly so, I found it entertaining and well worth the purchase price. Good reading to you all!
B00B0ZT9NI|3.0|I bought this movie because I had heard all the reviewers say how &#34;GREAT&#34; it is. When I first watched it, I fell asleep during most of it, it bored me. I watched it a second time, vowing to stay awake. It is a very short movie! I think its okay, but I've seen better. I don't know what is so great about the movie, unless everyone is talking about the fact that it is a true story. The movie itself is boring to me. The story the movie is made from is interesting, but the movie itself, bores me.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Okay, so I will say this book is very creative and well written. It is definitely missing something though, I do not feel satisfied with this ending at all. Read for yourself and you will see what I mean. This book needs to come down on it's price, not worth the $12.99.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Absolutely entertaining. Loved how they took the time to get all the characters involved. A really great job bring together all the themes from the other films too. Special effects simply dazzle. Can't wait to see it again.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love stories like this. Easy read and entertaining. I will love to purchase more books by Mira Lyn Kelly.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|It was a fabulous movie with one of my favorite actresses. A glimpse of the past that we never hear about.
B007REV4T8|5.0|It was really nice to see some more background on Bond.  Really a great movie, the whole family enjoyed it!
1449410243|5.0|I was very concerned about the possibility of my cat plotting to kill me so I bought this book. Very informative, and I learned even more about how cats think!
0316216445|5.0|This fantastic book is deservedly Waugh's most famous work. Insightful, piercing, and sardonic with all of Waugh's trademark finesse of language and unrelenting skewering of the human condition, yet he also manages a surprising amount of poignancy. Brideshead contains some unforgettable characters and is so worth your consideration, a beautiful novel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun but glitches at times. The game is sortable realistic. I suggest you buy this game
0618154248|5.0|I bought these books for my 16 month old son.  He loves to look through them and I love to read them to him.  They come all together in a nice little set and that way they don't get lost.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Admittedly, I have a pretty fast wired (powerline adapters) connection at home, but the HD streaming quality was great!  Not once did I have buffering issues, and Walking Dead is a fantastic series to say the least!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter loves littlest pet shop, she's going to love this game.  I've only checked out bout 5 mins of it, but she'll love it.  And such great quality for a free game.  P.S. I love it...  But I love just about game.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Love this series. It's too bad that the producers didn't decide to take it to the next step and delve into the lives and reigns of Henry's children.
0385742886|5.0|This was a little hard to get into after reading the other three. This took place before the first three novels. How ever oit was a good read and one of those that i thought i had figured out and i was totally wrong..
B003B02PF4|3.0|It had a political thriller feel to it but I was disappointed in the ending. It is a typical Grisham ending that doesn't provide a lot of detail, but he spent most of the book being very detailed then it seemed like he rushed the ending and didn't put much thought into it.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Got thsi as a request form my oldest daugther and se loves it. I was a great christmas present and it made her happy.
B000AP04NI|5.0|What a great classic. The movie quality and sound were excellent considering this is a fairly old movie.  We loved it.
0545265355|5.0|The Hungar games, the of the most intrersting and captivating reads out there for this stytle of writing. I really loved this story line and didnt weant it to end. Katniss was awesome and powerful in this novel.
B0085HWZ9Y|5.0|Had seen this show on PBS, so I wanted to get it to see it without all the pledge breaks...
0385738773|5.0|After reading the first two I couldnt wait to dice into this one, it was just as exciting and fun to read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is awesome. its very entertaining and sometimes can be a good challange. if u like horses then this is a great app for u. (free too!)
0385737947|5.0|Thsi first installment was great, I icant wait for the movie on this, it was exciting and and kept you guessing the thought behind this book was wonderful..
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A fun quick easy way to spend just a few minutes with a brain workout.  The puzzles start out easy and get progressively harder.  A good way to increase your pattern recognition skills.  Great if you have to wait a few minutes for a train or bus.  Smooth action and non invasive sound effects make for easy on the ears experience for the people around you.
0385738757|5.0|I loved the first two. Thsi just kept throwing it at you, you didnt see the things comming and they would grab you and put you on the edge of your seat good read.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book it's a must read book<br />It's really cool<br />As soon as you read it you'll know it's called wonder
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun and extremely entertaining. You will begin playing and lose track of time. I have found no flaws and truly regimens this game.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I downloaded this app but it did not work as a flash player on my kindle fire HD. The browser does not recognize it as a flash player.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I thought it was a good easy read with a twist at the end.  I look forward to seeing the movie.
B000006045|4.0|Don't let the cover fool you.  Mezzanine is an easy album to get into to.<br /><br />In fact, &#34;Dissolved Girl&#34; is my sole reason for purchasing the album.  I had to find this song.<br /><br />For starters, Mezzanine introduces the techno &#34;lite&#34; listener to a large array of elements including real instruments and live vocals.  Nearly every track has a distinctive sound which gives the entire album great &#34;replay value.&#34;  In particular, one track (which has been edited for a popular medical drama) is a masterpiece.<br /><br />If you've never heard of Massive Attack then this is a great way to experience them first hand.
0385366752|5.0|Through a series of bizarre twists and turns, the outcome of this story is wildly unpredictable!  Not your typical &#34;whodunnit&#34; kind of story!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is an interesting time suck of a game.  The point of the game is to match alike blocks on a three dimensional cube.  Some of the blocks look similar to other blocks, but don't match, so it does take some skill and practice to achieve a fast time, but the game is entertaining.
0307970299|5.0|This book captured my interest from beginning to end.  Ms. Strayed is on two journeys in this book--one with her physical self and one with her emotions.  Captivating!
B00A8SPNYW|1.0|This game is just a maze game.  Nothing special.  Takes longer to load animations than to play a level.  Maybe would entertain kids, but for anyone else, it just isn't worth it.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Ok so I bought it thinking it a waste BOY WAS I WRONG YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO find  NOTES UN LIKE THE OTHER SLENDER GAMES FOR KINDLE FIRE hd.Its not that SCARY but kind of.I CAN'T RECOMEND THIS ENOUGH.THERE'S day time night time easy medium and hard. There's also a barn near a grave yard and houses or you can go in this deserted street with crashed cars trees some houses the notes are a little tough to find every time you go the notes might be hidden somewhere else. If you go near slender your vision gets fuzzy. IF YOU GET 5 NOTES or more he grows tentecals!!!! There are 8 NOTES to collect. Intense music played after a note is collected.
B009A3NGF4|3.0|Bought the album for \\"I will wait\\" and overall the rest of the album was pretty good. Their sound is a nice break from a lot of the other stuff out right now.
0345522303|5.0|I got this for my girl friend and she loves the book series, and she could not put this down.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love all the cooking dash games. I have played them for years on my desktop. now i am able to take the game on my commute. This makes the time fly by. I also purchased diner dash and farm frenzy. But cooking dash is my favorite.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun addicting game but the coins should be 5 each because the shop is so expensive 300000 for a upgrade really??? I hope the game created a fix that problem..
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|The HP 12C financial calculator is an excellant calculator.  This one replaces my original, which lasted for about 25 years.
B002GHIPYI|3.0|The Superlux HD 681 is an semi-open, over-the-ear headphone.  The design bears a resemblance to the AKG K240 headphones as well as the Samson SR850 headphone.  The headphone has an impedance of 32 Ohms so it can be driven easily by on-board computer audio, mobile phones and etc.  The packaging is extremely simple, the headphones are wrapped in plastic with a piece of cardboard.  The package includes the headphone, a 1/4 adapter, and a carry bag.<br /><br />The headphones are very light and feel pretty comfortable on your head.  The clamping force is fairly low, but has enough force to stay on your head securely.  It is made of mostly plastic and the cord is fairly thick.  The ear pads are made of a semi soft vinyl and is pretty deep.<br /><br />I feel that these headphones have a very \\"V\\" like sound signature, meaning lots of bass, recessed mids, and sharp highs.  The quantity of bass on these headphones is amazing, when EQ'd up a bit, they will rattle your skull!  The mids feel a little recessed but vocals can be still be heard fairly well.  The highs are painfully sharp, so much that I had to EQ them down quite a bit for comfortable listening.<br /><br />The Superlux HD 681 offers a lot of value for what you pay for.  Unfortunately, these headphones suffer from 2 major flaws.  The first are the ear pads.  They are very uncomfortable and feel somewhat rigid.  I would highly recommend replacing them with either the Creative Sound Blaster World of Warcraft ear pads if you like pleather, or the AKG K240 velour ear pads if you like a velvet material.  The second issue are the painful highs, they are very fatiguing unless you EQ them down a bit.<br /><br />These observations are subjective but the fact still remains that for the price, you really can't do worse.
B0000DJE9R|4.0|Great music, but the recordings don't seem to be the best.  May need to increase the bass for better sound.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Is it just me, or is anyone else sick of these books with WEAK female characters that are so &#34;fortunate&#34; to have handsome and charming males around to save the day? That being said, it was an ok read. It reminded me a little of Twilight (probably just the style of writing and the weak female lead).
B008XNZMOU|4.0|I enjoy this CD, fun songs that get into your head, which I enjoy.  I'm not a huge Taylor Swift fan.
B0001NBMEE|5.0|A fun romp through King Arthur's court based on the news paper comic strip and staring a very young Robert Wagner and James Mason this has always been a personal favorite. The quality of the DVD is excellent as are other 2 films package I purchased including \\"Ivanhoe\\" & \\"The Black Shield of Falworth\\" makes this a Classic well worth the cost to any who enjoy the genre
B00401ZC7G|5.0|Very cute shoes for toddler.  Fit to size, daughter wears a 9 and the 9 fit perfect. She has wide feet, so the shoe isn't too loose but if your child had really skinny feet they might be too big.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Good but when I tried to get the update it said I had it but I didn't have it and the update keeps coming up and it annoys me I just want the update to STOP COMING UP
B0029XFNAI|5.0|my husbands favorite old Christmas tape and never thought to look and buy this tape. very very  great movie would recommend to anyone!
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is the best game ever and it teaches you a lot about taking care of animals and land and it also teaches you about money
B0081J9OWC|4.0|I'm new to Ed & the Zeros, but I love their energy. Mumford & The Avett Bros. are definitely in their peer group, but this band has it's own sound. They go great with The Alabama Shakes.
B00004I9PJ|1.0|CAN'T PLAY IT.  WRONG ZONE?????  MISSED SMALL PRINT SAYING IT MIGHT NOT PLAY. IF IT WON'T PLAY IN MY ZONE WHY SELL IT HERE??????
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I like the previous album more, but still really enjoy Some Nights. Some Nights has plenty of great tracks that didn't show up on the Top 40.
B00821OX98|5.0|I really love Falling Skies. Not really sure why because I'm not a big sci-fi fan, but I really love this show. I think it has some interesting storylines like the Skitterers and what they really are and the individual stories that are forming amongst the main characters in the Mass 2. It's a great show so far, can't wait for Season 3.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Great bonus features and commentary. Season two is easily the best season, but season one is essential viewing. Every episode is great.
B00A993UWM|5.0|This album was so surprisingly good, I couldn't not buy it.  Ke$ha gave us her usual pop sensations that get stuck in your head like &#34;Die Young&#34; and &#34;C'Mon&#34; but its the explicit tracks that really stick with you like &#34;Thinkin of You&#34; and &#34;Crazy Kids&#34; and make you say YEAH you go girl!  And of course it wouldn't be a Ke$ha album without the fun goofy songs like &#34;Dirty Love&#34; and &#34;Gold Trans Am.&#34;  If you like Ke$ha at all, you should download this album.  It is just downright enjoyable. (I'm not claiming it to be musical genius but it is a fun album)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really good game good graphics overall great game for kids of any age. Enjoyable for horse lovers and kids I love this game! It is so fun to play and take care of the horse of your choice.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|it's just amy, what can i say?  adele who? a sleek voice reminiscent of janis joplin w/out the intense rasp
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There were no hints to prepare me for the progression of the story in this book. Colleen Hoover is a phenomenal writer. She kept me glued to this book. Every paragraph and chapter only got better and better. I loved the characters and the details of their lives. This is not your typical fiction. She kept me guessing and waiting to see what would happen next. Loved it and although Skye is young, I can accept that she made the choices she did when she had been through so much in her tragic young life. It's a must read if you want an uncommon love story.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|This game seems very dark. The graphics are pretty good and the story is alright. Some hidden objects which I love!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I can see why the author threw in so much about football..... you do understand with reading the book about games in life, or maybe a movie.  I, myself do not enjoy football, but he did a great job writing the story and keeping us that don't like football, still engaged in the book.  I will admit, I did apply more speed reading in this book in that regard.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was a choice by my book club and sometimes I don't love those, this kept me engaged the whole time and I wanted the story to keep going even when the book ended!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I can only speak for me, but this book really touched my heart.....Very good narrative on the life of a person that has lived a life and now has to reflect back.  Well worth reading.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! My first praise to the author is thank you for writing a full book! It was so refreshing actually read a complete story. She probably could have dragged it into two stories but it didn't need it and she recognized that.<br /><br />I loved the characters and thought they developed well! Colleen never disappoints! I found myself laughing and crying. Very well done.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|So exciting to see episodes that I have never seen before. It was all I hoped for and more! Best show ever.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Still learning. Finding it challenging yet can already see how interesting and somewhat relaxing with the music. I'm sure it will keep me busy for a good long time
B000001F7R|5.0|Its the album that I grew up listening to, brilliant especially when you consider how old they were when they recorded it.
B0089LOKHG|1.0|I am so disappointed :( I dont understand… I think I may have gotten a bad copy. The end sounded like a completely different book. Did anyone else think it turned into a self help /motivational book at the end? One minute Im reading a romance adventure next minute idk what :(((((
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is as good as the first. It is sure to keep your attention and keep you wanting more.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I found myself unable to stop reading anxiously awaiting the arrival of Kevin. My heart raced as I read the pages and yet I just kept reading one more chapter....well it was all worth it. A fulfilling book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was so surprised that I could download the Bible App on my Kindle Fire. It is so easy to read and I found out that I could listen to it also. I really like to listen to it and also follow the words at the same time with my ear pods. This is a great feature if you are out and about and want something to pass the time away, insted of old magazines. What is better then the &#34;Bible&#34;
B007SGLZP8|1.0|After reading many other Grisham books I expected much more. A major disappointment.Fell asleep reading this one!<br />Time to find another author with some excitement and suspense.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I bought this after witnessing it on 5*, one of the many channels available in the UK. This was the only place to get it on Blu-Ray, we can get Glee on Blu-Ray in the UK but not this. It was estimated to arrive 4 days before it did. This wasn't too bad except for the delivery method chosen. I had previously ordered Glee on Blu-Ray from them and I had had no problems with this. Just this end DHL chose Yodel, I'm not sure how the two are related, and Yodel are fraught with problems and this is the first time I've ever dealt with them. I did eventually get it a week and a half later, and settled down to watch it. I like the addition of trailers, some of the shows I had never heard of. Then on to the main menu, a couple of times I had problems with the menu but maybe it's my Blu-Ray player. I prefer the Seasonplay on Glee, because I had to go through the language setting menu, then the intro, until I could click 'menu'. I'm only half way through and haven't made it to any special features, I wanted to watch the show so don't tend to bother with audio commentaries. It's nicely packaged. I like the lenticular cover, though it does just look like someone stuck it on with a bit of glue, and it's squify but that's me being a perfectionist. The video is great, the audio is great, it's a great difference from watching it off regular SD TV. Given the ending I do wonder about Season 2 though, but that will shortly be shown over here. If you're into happy endings, don't mind a bit of violence (though it's gently done) then this show could be the one for you. If you're still undecided, read another review but if you're not from the UK then I guess the delivery might not bug you.
B006PHD0RW|2.0|This game is sooooooooooo fun. I always can't wait to play. This it is truly the best game ever truly.
B0032JTV74|5.0|Speaking of Glee, like I was in my other review. This is excellent. I didn't get into the show from the very beginning but when I did I couldn't stop watching it. I had previously bought season 1 on DVD from the UK, as I am, but thinking that maybe only the US release got these New Sue's Corners, I took the plunge. The sound is good, and the picture is awesome. I love the use of Seasonplay, gets annoying when you just want to watch one episode but for most people this shouldn't be a problem. Season 2 was middling and Season 3 was interesting but this is where it all started. If you like music, if you like comedy, then you might like this. Auto tune rocks!!!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|At first I found it hard to follow this book and kind of felt like it was over my head.  But once I got about a third of the way into it I couldn't put it down.  And when I finished it I immediately purchase City of Ashes.
B000FC1PNE|5.0|I love the Bridgerton family books! The characters are enjoyable, and the stories always entertaining. The writing makes you want to read the rest of the series.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|this movie still make the hair stands the hair on the back of my neck stand up .would recmend the movie to any one who would like there boyfriend or girlfriend to jump in your lap.
B003TH2LYY|5.0|After watching a few Firefly panels on Youtube, and hearing this show mentioned repeatedly, I finally decided to check it out.  I was hooked by the 2nd episode of the first season.<br /><br />This season is keeping me smiling.  The characters are fun to watch, and the acting is top notch.  The mysteries occasionally show their hand too early, but the character interaction is where the fun of this show comes from.<br /><br />There's comedy, sexual tension, heartbreak, and redemption.  It's a satisfying show that I'm glad I found.  Can't wait to catch up so I can start watching it unfold in it's current season.
B00A757EFW|1.0|It was just hard to navigate.  I have the HD Kindle and couldn't keep pacy in bounds.  Just too slippery
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really addictive. I play this game like everyday and its a really fun game. I gave it 5 stars because its fun and its cool how they switch the citys!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is good game it is really great<br />if you want the game I suggest this game to horse lover like me
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was very intense and brought insight into the confused mind of someone who is attempting to recover from mental illness and what a tremendous struggle this must be.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|Slow download to my kindle fire. Needs Internet and facebook to play full game. When game started it took over an hour to complete loading. Text is very small and instructions are extensive. Need to spend real money to make good progress. Graphics are excellent and play is smooth. I do not think I will live long enough to really understand how to play this game. Uninstalled.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Amazing CD from start to finish.  I would highly recommend this to any Opeth fan,  or if you've never listened to them before this would be a great introduction.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely surprising and truly heartfelt and emotional. Beautifully written and truly thoughtful. I'm astounded by Colleen Hoover's courage and tenacity to write this beautiful story.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Several dragons and habitats I cannot  get on my kindle.Please  adjust game settings so i can get VIRTUE,LEFT AND RIGHT,& FUll HEART ,ICE CREAM ,CHOCOLATE,  pink habitat,and heart habitat!!! Addicted to this game,but upset that I will never be able to get these on my device!!I would give it 5 stars if I could get these dragons and habitats.
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|As with most so called country groups, this collection is hit or miss.  5 out of 11 songs were pretty good but more pop than country for my taste.
B008WOULPK|4.0|Vogue has been a fashion staple in my life since I was 15 years old. Although I knew the obvious things about Grace. Her incredible photographic stories in Vogue. That she had a love of the whimsical. But it was refreshing to read about her as a person outside the magazine. The truth is finally out...Anna Wintour is not the end all be all of Vogue. There's a passionate, firey red-head out there that gives her a run for her Prada!
B00A7OIXW6|1.0|I think this movie is awful and I don't recommend it for anyone, especially children. In fact, it embodies most of the things I try to avoid for my kids: violence, sexual typecasting and innuendo, glorified verbal abuse and unkind behavior, comedy at the expense of others, lying and cheating to win, disrespect of elders, disrespect of authority, etc. Commonsensemedia missed the boat entirely on the rating of this film in my opinion. The word that comes to mind is gratuitous. The lack of taste with which this movie was made was very distracting from the plot, for me. The characters are demeaning and rude to each other. All females are portrayed as harsh and rude or prudish and rude. One of the female characters is decked in a skin tight costume with giant breasts, tiny waist, and round hips and thighs. She is carrying an automatic weapon and leads the assault team in her video game to kill the enemy with an abundance of verbal abrasiveness. Why is she like this? Because her fiance is killed on their wedding day by a giant evil bug, so she is now bitter and violent. And of course, the nice guy falls in love with her. The more she abuses him, the deeper he falls. Is this really what we want to model for our kids? Why is that so popular in media today? The innocent sweet boy falls for the bitchy hot girl who mistreats him. what? In one game, there is a group of snarky girls who gang up on the outsider girl who is one of the &#34;positive&#34; role models of the movie. At the end, she says, &#34;and for anyone who was ever mean to me... you will be executed.&#34; (gasp from the mean girls) and then she says, JUST KIDDING. The banter between the other main character – Ralph - and her is almost all antagonistic and demeaning - it is supposed to be funny but 7 year olds do not have the sophistication to understand this level of sarcasm. I understand it and I didn't find it funny, I found it distasteful. Most of the lines were intended for adults and I only laughed two orthree times, as I found the movie mostly offensive. One of the “positive role model” scenes is when Ralph gives a giant cherry to a homeless video game character. The catch is that he stole the cherries in the first place. And just before this Ralph is stopped by security and the guy says something like do you have anything to say? And Ralph says “yeah, I hate you.” and the security guy says, &#34;yeah, we get that a lot.” There is another scene where a character is comparing an obsolete video game to his &#34;Nana&#34; saying disparaging things about having to put her out to pasture and get rid of her. Again, 7 year olds don't need to be introduced to the concept of disrespecting their grandparents. Most 7 year olds adore their grandparents. There are so many inappropriate scenes; I would say that the majority of the movie is inappropriate for children for one reason or another. It is ALARMING to me that this movie is billed as a movie for small children. What are we thinking???? This movie contributes to the phenomenon in this country known as age compression, where children are exposed to concepts in media that they do not have the maturity to process. They begin to emulate the complicated dynamics of sexual behavior, mean girls, and sick romance at younger and younger ages, and they don't understand any of it. Parents need to be aware that movies like &#34;Wreck It Ralph&#34; are not made for the enrichment of children, they are made for profit by people who don't really care about children. I think the story line idea is creative and some of the concepts are creative; this movie could have been good. Unfortunately the movie is so vulgarized and degraded by the content that the creativity is overshadowed, in my opinion. This movie is not &#34;FOR&#34; kids, it is made &#34;FOR&#34; money at the expense of kids. I would suggest skipping this one altogether.

B005K17RU0|3.0|Beautiful looking app. Lots of bells and whistles. However, display does not change whenever tablet is turned. Always on feature does not allow Kindle to automatically shut off when cover is closed. Had to uninstall. I like my auto-sleep/wake feature more than the fancy weather app.

B00622B3MY|1.0|I bought this movie for my 3 year old, and that was a mistake. After watching the movie, he has been waking up in the middle of the night with bad dreams and has been running around the house talking about killing McQueen and keeps saying 'kaboom'. This movie should not be rated 'G', and I caution parents against buying it for young children.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I tried several different calendars to connect myself with my office, phone etc... This one actually worked with my google calendar and I am not pulling out my hair any longer. So now I can read my book and then check to make sure if my next hour is really free or not.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Thanks for making this album affordable for lots of people!<br />Bruno Mars, the Smeezingtons and all writers and producers of this album are truely gifted artist making music attractive to ages 4 to 104.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is an amazing game, lots of fun, thank goodness no add<br />pop-ups...this gamer reminds me of mario bros. Well worth downloading!
B008EKON56|5.0|The reason I love this dock, is because I have ruined countless iPad cords when using  my iPad on my lap. The cord that comes out of the bottom always gets bent, and eventually shorting out. this dock has the connection on the side so the charging cord comes out the side, so just the bottom of the dock can rest on your lap without bending the cord. I looked everywhere for an iPad/iPhone cord where the wire comes out the Sid instead of the bottom, this is the only dock I could find that has this option.
B00ATP24NW|1.0|Somehow, producer Alex da Kid thought that intentionally introducing that awful, cheap sounding distortion (several tracks, most notably beginning on 'Radioactive'), was somehow \\"artistic\\".  What a stupid idea.<br /><br />One word Alex...WRONG. It's not Eno-esque, not even close.  It's asinine and sophomoric.  You aimed badly and missed.<br /><br />It's like Alex thought that he could pull off a musical equivalent of that classic photographic technique whereby emphasizing the \\"grainy\\" look of B&W Film can have a pleasing effect in portrait work.<br /><br />HEY ALEX...IT DOESN'T WORK WITH MUSIC.<br /><br />For the first time I can recall, I am returning a recorded work to the retailer because it is \\"defective in workmanship\\".<br /><br />What makes me scratch my head is that the band didn't veto this idiotic idea.  Oh well, they're young.<br /><br />Hopefully the band still have masters that haven't had the distortion added yet.  In a few years, maybe they'll release a \\"we booted Alex da Kid\\" remix.<br /><br />I will buy it immediately.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack has lots of room and pockets.  I have all my camera accessories and cords in one spot.  It is very easy to access your camera and lens.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I found that this app works very well on the Kindle Fire.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Pinterest.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I dread finishing these books.  I'm a former avid reader and find that most books don't keep my attention/interest.  This book is so well written, I have a hard time picking my favorite character.  And the chapters are short, for some reason this helps with my attention span.  Great story, a little fantasy, but not too far out there.  It really is magical.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Read the book by Michael Connerly and was pleasently surprised by movie.  As I recall the book, the film is very faithful to it.  McConaughey does a fine job as Mick Haller.  Fast paced and plot twists add to enjoyment.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Fast shipping and none of the discs skipped. I'm loving smallville so much I will be very sad when ive seen them all
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a really cool game it's hard but cool .you have to have skills to get a really high score but it's fun and don't worry if you keep dyeing you will win your score .
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was probably the last one in my group to read 50 Shades, so I might have had my hopes up that this was going to be something outside the usual titllating &#34;women's&#34; read. It wasn't. The characters came across a B-grade soap opera actors and frankly, I lost interest not too far into the book. However, I stayed with it until the end only to find the conclusion predictable.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is decent if your looking for a game to spend your time on and if your looking for a way to compete with your friends.
B0000549B0|5.0|This movie shipped on time, shipping was free. I would recomand this movie for a night in when you hant to be with the family or your honey
B00B0NDF26|4.0|This is my first time listening to the duo, and I must say I'm impressed. There are a couple of songs I don't particularly care for but overall I like the album. I may go back and listen to their old stuff or I might just wait to see if they'll shock me again with something new.
B004W1GCQO|3.0|not as interesting as downton abbey but kept my attention for the most part. would like to see more episodes.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chose it because is the point of view all articles by the other hand in need of the entire process and the other day I chose it because I chose it because I have been in need of the other book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|omg what a interesting stories and actors. i love the way they phrase what they are saying. they can sting but not too obviously.
B004GKMV16|4.0|Comment<br />I like the way one is taken through time, by following different families. I have also read New York and Sarum by the same author. It takes time to read the book !
B002O5M4SA|5.0|..but I was proved wrong. I bought this dvd and experienced none of the negativity mentioned in the many reviews rated with one star. The video quality it awesome: so whoever is complaining about this, it's time to buy a better quality blu-ray dvd player. I had US version of this movie, and it have always felt that something is missing, something was butchered off of this masterpiece. And now, finally it is complete and makes sense.
0321344758|5.0|I love the book and can't count the number of times I cite it to others.<br /><br />Over the years I have found myself frequently pushing the concepts with traditional application developers - because they definitely translate.<br /><br />Lately I've realized that the usability expectations for all applications are set by the web and mobile application experiences because they dominate people's computer experiences now.<br /><br />Web / mobile started out with the necessity of keeping things simple and concise due to API and device size limitations.<br /><br />I think these constraints inadvertently has caused developers to stumble on the truth that has been there all along - technical people (I'm one) tend to make applications overly complex.<br /><br />The same principle applies equally to applications as it does to websites and mobile - given two alternatives for the same basic work - the one that provides the least cognitive friction to \\"finding your way around\\" will always win.  In training we call this \\"Cognitive Load Management\\"
B0025KW29U|5.0|...that this was one of the most amazing movies they've ever seen. And I see why. Because I'v seen many musicals, and this one is one of the two that really are worth watching. (The other one is Chicago)
B007FIY3VW|5.0|Perfect complement to my other tablet apps.  This is all I need for travel!  And it was free - nice!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I just love this movie. I have watched it at least 20 times on DVD and now I hope to watch it more even when I'm at work.
B005LAII62|3.0|Three major \\"horror\\" themed animated films were released in 2012:  PARANORMAN, FRANKENWEENIE and HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA.<br />PARANORMAN is my least favorite of the three.  PARANORMAN gets a little preachy at times and isn't quite as humorous as I had expected.  There are some visually impressive moments and the voice cast does fairly well, but the movie's original concept gets mired in the all-too-familiar underdog who saves the day.  And the humanizing of zombies purifies the film, leaving no real source of conflict.<br />I may be too \\"old school\\" but I wish modern animated films would try to be funnier and less message-oriented.<br />PARANORMAN is not child-friendly nor especially notable for adults.  Older youths and discerning parents may find it entertaining.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I read the book all the while hoping for a plot twist or significant revelation of the identity of 'friend'. Charlie appears to be socially awkward but his intelligence is not addressed until late in the story. His character is not really deep and defined and therefore it was hard for me to feel empathy or understanding.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|It kept my interest but I did not find it to be exciting. I liked the characters well enough I suppose. Its a different kind of story that is interesting and easily read in increments.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Yep, i'm on the bandwagon with everyone else, and I should have reviewed this when there were 500 fewer reviews.  It did however give me the opportunity to re-read it.  The first time I kind of breezed through and thought it was very good, and afterwards I kept thinking about it, which caused the re-read.  The re-read convinced me of its excellence.<br /><br />It's hard to put my finger on what makes it so good.  Maybe it's because there are no dull moments in the book that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Or perhaps it's because you can really identify with the main character, even when you disagree with his decisions or actions.  Maybe it's because of the awesome, and completely unexpected revelations at the end of the book.  Wow, reviewing it even makes me want to read it a third time.<br /><br />I think though, that one of the reasons why I like this book is because of what it doesn't have - unnecessary verbiage and subplots that the reader doesn't care about.  I can only hope that the author doesn't fall prey to potential demands of his publisher to lengthen this into the next WoT/ASOIF/Demon Cycle/Chronicles of the Black Company/etc.  Don't let us down, Anthony Ryan!!!<br /><br />If you have to read 1 fantasy book, it's LOTR for spawning the genre.  But if you want to read another, then this is the book you read for a great story without the length and character list of the White Pages.  There are a lot of other great books out there too that begin a series, but from what I've seen so far I give this my vote of confidence.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I would say this is definitely worth the money if you enjoy watching Downton Abbey. I have not had the opportunity to go through the hours of additional material included but look forward to doing so. I believe you can now obtain all 3 seasons in Blu-ray at one time and I would do that instead of buying them separately.
0765325950|3.0|It's amazing really that this verbose, 14 book series still doesn't really deliver on the premise and leaves so many questions open.  And it's a credit to all of us out there who stuck with it after so many disappointing books.  Apparently they are releasing another encyclopedia-type companion book after this, and haven't announced any other books to follow in this universe.  This is not a short book, and is devoted to the last battle, but as other reviewers noted it resolves several plot items with a line or two while not resolving others at all.  That's ridiculous and completely unfair to the reader in a series with tens of thousands of pages.  On the other hand, it isn't a bad book and if you've put in enough time to get to this book then you should read it when it gets to the library.<br /><br />This has really changed my outlook on reading fantasy series.  I am much more sensitive to series &#34;jumping the shark&#34; or padding the overarching storyline with unnecessary subplots, and in the future I won't make the same mistake of sticking with it when I think that is happening (e.g., Warded Man series).  P.S. if this bothers you too and you are thinking of watching the remake Battlestar Galactica, steer clear.<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT****<br />I do think it's probable that the publisher and editor will continue to release books in this universe.  I'm not going to bring Sanderson into this because it doesn't seem he is really to blame for the split of the last book, and certainly not for the extension of the series up to that point.  Also, his career isn't based on a million-book long series and he is just recently started his first with the book Way of Kings.  Anyway, back to WoT.  Specifically, not resolving the question of the Aiel (and don't believe anyone who says that it is resolved as the resolution reference is so weak a light breeze would knock it over)  and allowing a special character to escape his fate as stated in prior books tantalizes the fans enough to get them to continue to spend.  And the Padan Fain resolution?  He can make it all the way to Shayol Ghul through all his other trials and goes out so easily?  Also, IMO the &#34;battle&#34; between Rand and the Dark One is completely anticlimactic and simply chews up pages with the permutations presented.  And what was going on with Nakomi?  This, and so much more, is all fodder really for books in the next, or subsequent ages, designed to part reader with currency.s enough to get them to continue to spend.

B008HT4FUW|5.0|There is intrigue. There is tension between family and staff and then additional divisions within those two sides. If you enjoy history you will enjoy this series. The costume design and the locations used for the series are excellent. Unlike The Tudors, where you know who will die when and how, Downton Abbey keeps you guessing as to what will happen next in one of many story lines, though some of the turns are fairly obvious. This series is excellent! Definitely buy all 3. You will be surprised how quickly the hours pass as you become engulfed in the action of Downton Abbey!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|You will find it similar to Forever War and Starship troopers, but if you like those books this will likely satisfy.
B007SGM084|5.0|Every turn of the page there was always something you just had to read. I couldn't put the book down. Love it.
B00633W614|5.0|I was hooked on this series from the 1st page.  I read Only TIme Will Tell and had to immediately begin Sins of the Father.  I only hope the 3rd book in the series does not take to long to be published.  I've read other Jeffrey Archer books and have loved them all.  IF you allowed 10 starts, that is what I'd give this book and series.
1595826971|5.0|Great boo, hard cover, great detail in pictures.<br />Shipping was fast.<br />Great for tweens or adults.<br /><br />This would make a great gift for anyone who loves the werid.
0307346617|4.0|I loved this book especially the way it was written. I can't wait to see how the movie turns our.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is my favorite t. V. Show.  I love the plot, action, twist and turns.  This is like living out all the times you want to get revenge yourself but there's no fear of getting caught.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was my first kindle book and I could not stop reading it. The main character and his trials after being left on Mars made for non-stop drama.
B00005ONMJ|4.0|three of them were recorded or filmed between 1954 and 1956: Furtwangler, Krips, and Mitropoulos (see my reviews). Siepi and Della Casa sing in all three; Dermota is Ottavio  with Krips and<br />Furtwangler while Simoneau sings with DM; Corena sings Leporello with Krips and DM; Streich is Zerlina with DM and Gueden with Krips; Grummer also sings with  DM while Suzanne Danco sings Donna<br />Anna for Krips; for DM Frick is the Commendatore while Kurt Bohme sings the role with  Krips; Walter Berry is Masetto for all three.<br />The Mitropoulos is also a live performance.  While sound is not a major problem for the three, I would rank them as follows: Krips, Mitropoulos, and Furtwangler.  Furtwangler sometimes conducts too slowly, which I find problematic . However, he atones at least partly in two ways.  Some scenes/ensembles which begin slowly catch fire progressively, eg the Act I conclusion and Cemetery sextet.<br />Secondly, within these variable tempi, the entire cast sings with maximum intensity whatever emotion(s) is being dramatized.  To see the singers in the cemetery sextet (minus Siepi and Dezso Ernster) is a pantheonic event- all of them at their peaks or on their way except Erna Berger whose voice remained astonishingly pure and beautiful until her sixties. Siepi and Edelman were a great team//Siepi and Corena ( a bit more elegant as Leporello but just as comic). Edelman cowering on the ground in the cemetery reminded me of a guilty Cartman in South Park.<br />Re the other two Vienna recordings: Mitropoulos  employs quicker tempi -he is a bit more dramatic than Krips , e.g in the final two scenes. Two singers for DM only are at least equal<br />to their peers in the other versions: Rita Streich and Leopold Simoneau (not a better singer than Dermota but the owner of a more beautiful voice, I think).  Krips' cast is equally good with<br />the possible exception of Suzanne Danco as Donna Anna.  She is excellent vocally and dramatically but I prefer Grummer'svoice. I consider the Krips and Mitropoulos indispensible but would not<br />want to be without the Furtwangler version.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The twists and turns in this season make for a great suspense every week...the scenes are realistic should we as a nation should ever experience something like this...it's not perfect but it's close enough for me considering the junk that's currently on television and at the movies.
B00ATP24NW|4.0|I'm starting my CD collection for my inevitable car purchase, but I'm trying not to overstock so I'm only buying entire albums of bands I absolutely adore. This one made it to the collection. All of the songs are beautiful, powerful and uplifting; they're a pleasure to listen to at any time, and were obviously made with a lot of emotion. It's everything I look for in music.<br />On the downside, I was under the impression that the song \\"Working Man\\" was included on the actual album (hence why I did not sift through the track list again- I saw it advertised under \\"Night Visions\\"). To my disappointment I just learned that it was an iTunes only track. Of course that is something I should have known, and I wouldn't knock off a star for it, if it weren't for the fact that I believe that to be one of their best (if not their best) tracks and really think it should have been on the CD. Pff.<br />Anyway, 5 stars for the band and music itself, 4 stars for this collection.<br />Definitely check them out!
B0063GORYU|4.0|You can spend many hours at this game. It has several levels of difficulty from fairly easy to very difficult.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The title says it all. Make an account, log in and never forget anything again...unless you forget to make a note.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is an amazing game, its just that the limitations are so annoying: no caves, no rain,snow, or any weather. There isn't even nonlinear multiplayer! But the new things are coming into the game, VERY slowly... ***NONLINEAR IS ONLINE*** TYPO***
B0063IH60K|5.0|Can't stop playing! I haven't played in years, but once again, find myself hooked. This app is definitely worth the download.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Mad Men is one of the finest dramas on TV. I just got done watching Sopranos and Mad Men ranks right up there with it. Sophisticated, complex, bad ass, and sometimes funny, I loved every single episode.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The obstacles,the powerups,it's all great! It is a exciting app,especially when you are going fast!It is so awesome. Your kids will love it!
B001GCUER0|5.0|Mad Men is my new favorite show. Season two packs some surprises, the characters grow more complex and the story line twists in a tantalizing fashion. The sets and wardrobe are very realistic for the time, portraying the 1960s better than anything in the modern day. Women want to be with Don Draper and men want to be him. Roger, Don, Peter, Peggy, and the rest of the cast inegrate, well, home and office life into one.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|My grandsons' parents use this toy ( app? ) to appease him, He'll be a non-caring moron well before he's in his teens. But he'll fit right in. I will buy him a T shirt when he progresses into his mid-thirties...if he hasn't KILLED US ALL by then,
B002ROKQJM|4.0|I found the book to be a very interesting insight into Indian society and power relationships within it. However there were a few things I struggled with (as an outsider)...the level of political and business corruption in India - is it really as bad as portrayed in the book? Secondly, the White Tiger's boss and his wife are educated, westernized Indians - why would they be discussing their marriage problems and shady business deals in Hindi in front of the servants? Wouldn't they stick to English when talking about this stuff? My Indian friends can probably correct me on this. I realise the story wouldn't work if he didn't know what they were talking about.<br />I enjoyed the story but I didn't quite know where to go with it, it was difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters in the book. The White Tiger is a murderer and ruthless go-getter. His family see him as little more than a meal ticket, ruin his chances for an education and exploit him. His boss intends to repay his loyalty by forcing him to take the rap for a hit and run accident that killed a child. I didn't like any of them and didn't really care what happened to them.
1595826971|5.0|Este libro superó las expectativas que esperaba, bien expuesto, para los que disfrutamos el juego es un complemento mas que merecido.

0865478007|4.0|Goldacre made me so conscious of semantic sloppiness that I thought I saw a few examples in his own text. No, I didn't write them down. No, they were not major. And, yes, they might not have existed at all. I have no background whatsoever in the subject matter.<br /><br />Despite the title, Goldacre describes harm to patients coming from academics, lobbyists, regulators, and politicians, not just drug companies.<br /><br />Bottom line is that patients should check independent sources before commiting to any drug treatment. These sources and the questions to ask are well documented in Bad Pharma.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and Gerard Butler is one of my favorite actors ---i first saw him in  THE PHANTOM of THE OPERA<br />He is great in any movie
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Book two takes us into the the second generation of family from &#34;Fall of Giants&#34;. Great continuation and good historical insight. Follett develops some interesting characters and places them at Historical crossroads.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Very creative story idea. Just the right amount of danger and suspense. I look forward to future stories and adventures for Miss Peregrine and the children.
B0084670FU|3.0|Heavy movie - very depressing. Some parts left me feeling very uncomfortable. Not the worst I've seen. Not much else to say.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought I would get bored with this pretty quickly but I still play just about every day. It's relaxing and I'm enjoying it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's so very sad that I have finished the third book, and it's actually over!! I am very sad that there is not a fourth book, it was such a good read. I am hoping E L James can come up with a 4th if not a 5th and 6th series of this story. They (Ana and Christian) are still VERY YOUNG!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing. It makes me appreciate life that much more. Today will forever shape our tomorrows. Live free and enjoy every minute. There are no real faults in our stars. Be happy. Read. Fall in love with this novel as I did.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was recommend to me by a friend and as soon as I was done reading it I texted her to say thanks for such a great recommendation. This book is filled with mystery, love and twists. My sister completed suicide two years ago. This book really hit home for me and makes me wonder what happened to her that she felt there was no way out. I just wish she had the strength and courage Sky had to keep living. I love this book and recommend it to every one. Thank you Toni for recommending it to me and for always being there for me when I need you. Thank you Coleen Hoover for such a great book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game! My kids are better then me but it is sure fun to play with them! We have a trying to beat each other.

B003UBTX72|5.0|This book is honest down and dirty. Keith's insights into the evolution of music in our time are the most enlightening and authentic I have ever read. The writing is thoroughly engaging and in his own voice. Don't expect to get much sleep..

0307957837|5.0|I just finished reading His Dark Materials trilogy. I am 61 years old and do not feel this are not just \\"children's\\" books at all! Mr. Pullman creates very real but very imaginary world(s)in these pages that are for very mature readers. In fact, the issues and themes the characters face are more mature than most of us face at any time.<br />The descriptions and character development are amazing and I felt like I was \\"there\\" with Lyra and Will the whole time.<br />Will's father's character and words of wisdom shine through and even Mrs. Coulter and Lord Asriel are redeemed at the end by their sacrifice.<br />Christians will not like these books: the theme of building the \\"Republic of Heaven\\" here on Earth and not the \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" when we die is most prevalent.<br />The mysteries of \\"Dust,\\" \\"Spectors,\\" and daemons are not easily understood, but pondering on these themes is fascinating.<br />When Lyra insists on going to the realm of death to ask forgiveness from Roger, she in essence is doing that which is so very hard for us all to do but is so important.<br />Teaching kindness to others and living each day with enjoyment is presented in the most profound images I have ever read.<br />I could not put these books down!!!!

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|For years, video game based movies are always been horrible from Super Mario Bros to Doom, it seems that Hollywood could not adapt the awesomeness of video games to the silver screen and many people are pre-disposed to dismiss video game based movies as garbage until this time, while technically Wreck-It Ralph is not a real game, it was made for the movie, it seems that all we needed was an original story to get it right.<br /><br />Wreck-It Ralph is a movie about misunderstood and unappreciated Wreck it Ralph, the bad guy from Fix-It Felix, jr. After attending a bad guy support group meeting and being shunned from the 30th anniversary party for his game, Ralph is determined to win a medal and some respect for his part in the game. The movie features many cameos from classic video games, a warm and touching story filled with action and eye popping graphics, this is a perfect movie for the family or date night (guys, if your girlfriend is not into games, let her watch this movie with you and she will have a better appreciation for  your hobby).<br /><br />The ultimate collector's edition comes with a Blu-ray, DVD, 3D version and digital copy, included is the short &#34;Paperman&#34; which was shown to open the movie, it is also a short and sappy story about a plain guy who meets a young woman (who looks like Anne Hathaway) and some hijinks involving paper airplanes leads them to a chance encounter, very nice. Deleted scenes and bonus documentaries round out the extras and worth a look.<br /><br />The visuals and sound are outstanding in Blu-ray, I watched this on a 1080p LED tv and the colors and details are amazing, you feel like you are in the game/movie, the retro feel of the Fix-It Felix game to the intensity of the Hero's Duty game really capture what arcade gaming is about, the Sugar Rush game is the best with all the colors and details of the background and the supporting characters, the writers and animators were very clever with all the details and you can tell this movie is a labor of love for all to enjoy.<br /><br />Finally, the heart of the movie is not only in its graphics and video game cameos but the story, I think most people have felt like Ralph (John C. Reilly), misunderstood, unappreciated and unwanted in their lives, it is nice that he tries to improve his lot in life by reaching his goals and you can really feel for him when he sees Vanellope (played beautifully by Sarah Silverman) going through something similar in her game, they form a bond and it is hard not to smile as the story unfolds and you can laugh, cry and feel good about yourself and for the characters at the end of the movie. I highly recommend this movie for anybody who wants to enjoy a good movie and if you can, enjoy with some you love, you won't regret it.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I was excited to see Wreck It Ralph from the moment the first preview aired on TV.  With as much excitement as built as I saw familiar characters (like Bowser) and learned more about the plot, I was sure that it would disappoint.  After all, my expectations were much too high to be satisfied with anything less than spectacular.<br /><br />Wreck It Ralph is Spectacular.<br /><br />The animation is beautiful, as are the lively colors.  The cast could NOT have been better chosen as John C. Reilly delivers an excellent performance as Wreck It Ralph.  My biggest concern about the film was Sarah Silverman, of whom I'm not a big fan generally speaking.  She also delivered a wonderful performance and I found myself in love with the little girl named Vanellope von Schweetz (Silverman).<br /><br />Jane Lynch and Jack McBrayer provide an excellent side plot as they search for Wreck It Ralph when he leaves the game in search of a way to become a Hero.<br /><br />Gaming fans will be thrilled to catch glimpses of classic characters and the easter eggs in this movie are awesome.  Even if you aren't a big gamer, you'll be thrilled with the pop culture references.  This movie appeals to all ages and you'll find yourself giggling alongside of small children as the word \\"Duty\\" is thrown around like \\"Doody\\".<br /><br />This movie delivers the typical \\"Disney Feel\\" with wonderful lessons learned, but with a modern technology twist to it.  Wreck It Ralph will definitely get a spot of honor on my DVD shelf, right next to The Lion King and Aladdin.<br /><br />Oh- and while you're watching the movie, be sure to Pause it for \\"Intermission\\"- a most unexpected surprise, Disney gives you a guided tour to easter eggs in the movie!
0446571415|5.0|I've enjoyed the entire series of the &#34;Camel Club&#34; adventures.  Brilliant writing by a fantastic writer and storyteller &#34;David Baldacci&#34;.<br />Everyone must read &#34;The Camel Club&#34;, &#34;Stone Cold&#34; and &#34;Divine Justice&#34; before reading &#34;Hell's Corner&#34;.  These stories and characters are all interrelated.  Fantastic reading on all counts.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|It is the same with this cd.  His voice is pure his songs are gritty and he sings all of them so soulfully.  His music reaches deep into one's soul.  His beauty of voice is magnificent and he was found musically in later life and performed again.  His life story is sad his music is fantastic and hopefully in later life his life gained more of the beauty of his music.
B0067R0APK|5.0|It is a wonderful app. I like the graphics and you can add as many cities as you want to keep track of. Definitely worth the 99 cents. It would be absolutely perfect if it had the barometric pressure listed. I suffer from headaches and have to use another app for this.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I love this man's voice and his tragic story is so heartrendering.  The documentary about him is fantastic as well.  I saw it on a flight and that is how I found out about him.  There is a purity to his voice and a gritty reality to his words.  His music is so very beautiful!
0470449748|5.0|This is a great guide. I purchased two copies, one for me & another for my best friend and it has helped us tremendously.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I feel I should have. It wasnt a book that I could lose myself in, even though I wanted to.<br />However, it would make a great movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so much fun I play it everyday. I am addicted! It is the best game I have. I would buy it again.
B000002LEE|5.0|This album is my favorite Janes album to date.  With classics like Jane Says and Summertime Rolls, how can you not love it?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Was not disappointed with this Nicholas Sparks book -- as always.  His books just seem to get better and better.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Been watching the old seasons to refresh on all that has happened so far. We really love watching Sons of Anarchy!
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|Seeing this movie in the theater was great - it is simply a tour de force for Tolkein fans. That said, I will happily pickup this movie and parts 2 and 3 later on when they are a set with extended editions. I'm waiting!  Enjoy.
1451695195|1.0|I was quite disappointed in this book, I expected it to be interesting, but it was not. It was to scientific.
B00177YA1K|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over...the theme is so ridiculous and fun...totally not to be taken seriously but to enjoy the ride and the slime!!!!  Smile and laugh the entire time!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|One of the best books in the series. The emails were Hot. Couldn't put it down =)) You will get the 3rd Book immediatly after because you wont want to stop.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|Great Movie!!!  Funny, original, and heart felt!  Great movie to watch over and over.<br /><br />I highly recomend the movie if you are a MIB fan!!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have only been using Pinterest for a few months and I love it. I usually sign into Pinterest everyday, either on my laptop or Kindle Fire. It's easy and convenient to find all the things you're interested in and keep up to date with them. It's just so simple...love it!
B004GVUPFE|3.0|It is sort of like tetrus but not as fast paced it is no that difficult to do but it is sort of fun
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|.... I couldn't but this down I stayed up all night reading.. I approve of hopeless. I will recommend .
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am enjoying the book very much.  Can't say this is one of my favorites.  Not my kind of reading.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Unaware of the premise, each scene was a surprise.  This was a good story, kept my interest throughout, and I applaud the ending.  Typical Denzel, well acted and powerful.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Great concert in HD , the bonus material in DVD and the 2 CD's with all the songs in the concert
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Loved all three of these books, finished them each on the day I received them. However, the ending was sadly flat and unbearable. I feel that a conclusion is one of the best parts. It wraps everything up and makes it seem that what you are reading was worth the time spent. This conclusion was not satisfying and I felt as if I was missing out on something that could have been great, like realizing there is one slice of cake left and you go to get it and realize, as your on your way over someone else gets it before you are able. It feels as if something was stolen... like its jut within reach but unattanable. I greatly enjoyed her books but was extremely disspointed with the ending!
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Since reading &#34;The Black Swan&#34;, I have enjoyed Nassim's ideas.  Unfortunately my mental abilities are insufficient to grasp some of his teaching, but I find myself agreeing with what he says.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were amazing once you start reading them you can't put them down you fall in love with Ana and Christian and find yourself holding your breath waiting to see what happens next I would recommend this collection for anyone who like romance with a twist
078322737X|5.0|I love it, everybody should watch this movie, this is a super awesome move that you need to watch now!
B008YRVW0I|2.0|so I paid the overpriced 6$ for the full version. not impressive, you basically have no challenge to keep wanting to play after the 3rd tank. and you get to the third tank pretty fast. limited items to buy to place into aquariums makes it get boring fast. not worth the $6 @ change they ripped me for. .99 cent app at best
B003N0XDT4|5.0|The sound quality this puts out is insane! I love it, you need to order yours right this very second.
B007NESBK2|5.0|made a mistake on the Kitaro dvd, didn't realize it was a movie, thought I was buying a dvd of the musician Kitaro.....not to happy about that.<br /><br />Sade dvd is phenomenal, excellent.......what a great concert
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show.  Especially the fact that I can watch it whenever I want on my Kindle. Great companion to my husband's football games.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Great book I would really recommended it to people how bleave in the apocalypse and to people how don't know what they need for the apocalypse.
0345803507|5.0|This book was a page turner.<br />I read it so fast, can't wait til the movie comes out<br />I'm Soooo there. Enjoyed it!
B00002E233|5.0|The Price was great as well as the shipping, it showed up on time and was in excellent shape, I will definitely leave good feedback and a good revue.
0345803493|5.0|This book was a page turner.<br />I read it so fast, couldn't wait to start book 3.<br />Soooo enjoyed it!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like to play and it is cool how the game does a world tour. I play it every day at home.
1451695195|4.0|As a neurosurgeon, Dr. Alexander was the consummate scientist with a logical explanation at the ready for any near-death experiences his patients told him about, until he has the ultimate experience himself.  Like To Heaven and Back, you do wish he gave you more details, but the general message of the book comes through loud and clear.  I love that he takes all the arguments he expected to hear from the &#34;scientific community&#34; regarding his experience and dismantles them, one by one.  Recommend this for anyone with doubts or curiosity about the afterlife.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My grandkids seem to enjoy it because it makes them use different strategies to find the answers. It causes them think.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly writes another great Bosch book. Great story, great characters, and I still love Bosch!  Makes you love L.A. all the more, too!
0307895475|4.0|It's simply awesome!<br />If there's anything you wanna know about the game, it's there.<br />You can see by the looks and content that this is worth buying.<br />Great job to whoever did this!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Many adapter cables won't fit the smaller openings in non-standard protective covers.  The Stubz adapter solves that problem perfectly, allowing me to use my iPod touch without removing the protective case.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was the BEST book I have EVER read I was so inspired this book truly changed my life I  hold so much more value to my life now that I see how vulnerable it can be and the process by which it can be revived..CHERYL STRAYED PLEASE MARRY ME!!
0375753419|3.0|The story by Mary Shelley is the story. There is nothing new to it and no embellishments. We haven't started on this book in my critical thinking class, but will use it later towards the end of the semester.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The movie was really good!  I am so thankful there wasn't any bad language.  There was a rather typical sexy 007 scene, but it didn't last very long.  A lot of action and suspense.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Much better than the first book! Couldn't put it down! A real page turner.  Lots of suspense and romance. Can't wait to read the next one.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|Easy to read, helpful guide to potentially complex command sequences, especially if you are not a UNIX programmer.<br /><br />If you buy the Pi, get the Guide!
B003V1WTMM|5.0|As with all Kate Morton's books, I am hooked from the first page to the last.  Just when you think you have figured<br />out what the ending will be,  you find out that you are wrong!  Her descriptions are vivid and her writing style is<br />excellent.  I hope there is a new one from her soon.
1439190275|5.0|A perfect pairing to go with the Atkins Workbook. Very informative and very useful information.  Easy to follow, glad I purchased it
B0063M22QO|4.0|Its very diverting.  Just enough challenge to make it interesting and yet fun too. would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of game.  Sounds can be turned on or off-you choose.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|All the Harry Potter without the extras. Came in brand new packaging. All the discs are in brand new shape. The only thing missing may be some DVD extras and deleted scenes. If you're like me and don't ever watch those, this is a steal for the price!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is such a great read. I haven't found a book I liked in many years but my husband got me watching the series on tv and now I'm hooked on reading the series. Can't wait for 03-31-13
0739313126|5.0|I drive long distances and this was a great book to listen to. I had seen the movie but of course this was much better. Very pleased with this purchase.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I have no idea why this movie wasn't nominated for best (adapted) screenplay because this is one truest to the spirit of the book adaptations I've ever seen. I loved this movie, the music, the performances. See it!
034580404X|5.0|recommended to anyone over twenty-one that wants a good book...<br /><br />also military wive this is a get read for those lonely nights!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of my fav TV Series.. PERIOD~<br /><br />Excellent story and acting.  IT just keeps you coming back for more.<br />WATCH and ENJOY
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|well it looks like it would of been a fun game, but falied to open 4 times, installed it twice. But I fir get an $1 from amazon for a free song download.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Fantastic visuals and special effects. Completely forgettable plot and dialogue. Great performance by the main robot character, but otherwise nothing special.
B000001ELL|5.0|This album has gotten a lot of criticism. If I'd have been a little older & liked KISS prior to this I'd probably feel the same way those people do about it. It was a departure from what KISS had been doing. By this time the product marketing (toys, comic books, lunch boxes & so on) was out of control + the solo albums were promoted with a massive advertising campaign that turned off many fans. I even heard one fan say \\"this isn't rock n roll\\"! So then comes \\"I Was Made For Lovin You\\", a disco flavored huge hit & more TV commercials promoting \\"the return of KISS\\". All this understood, I was young enough that I was attracted to the same ad campaign that turned off so many. I was, after all, the target audience. Years later I'm proud to say I'd end up liking KISS for the right reasons when I got a little older. This was my introduction though so maybe I'm bias but I think Dynasty is a great album. It remains one of my favorite KISS albums.
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|Great base story for people who know and love the series. It really tries to explain for the non-followers, but leaves out a little bit. I would like to think of it as a great resume piece for the real movie to come out. The stars in the movie are well prepared and give alot of effort. Also the sound effects are surprisingly accurate and are welcome to trained ears of the games.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|love, love, love this fire!  Best product yet on the market.  Only wish it held its power for a longer time while online.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I started watching this after my boyfriend raved about it and I was not disappointed. I love the story, characters and the premiss. If you like the post apocalyptic genre you should watch this!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is officially the best game ive ever played. now with the 0.6.1 update you can have armor;sighns<br />and a better nether.  I highly reccomend buying this game. the money is more than worth it.
B008K5T5AI|3.0|I am a fan of Banks culture novels; somehow this one left me with a slight sense of disappointment. The last one I had read was \\"look to windward\\" which had all the trappings & haunting feel of a grecian tragedy. In comparison, after an intriguing start, the Hydrogen Sonata seemed a bit rushed,the storyline becoming even a bit boring at some point, and the characters specially being defined a bit too black and white. I wouldn't suspect the venerable Iain Banks of writing a potboiler, but since there're no half points and I can't give it a 3,5, I'll rate it a 3 in comparison to & out of respect for \\"Look to windward\\", which gets a 5 from me.
B005PK553C|5.0|I was hooked in the first episode and couldn't wait till the next episode. It is one of the most intense TV shows I've ever watched and highly recommend if you like intense, dark scary shows. I love Jessica Lange.
B001O1O71C|5.0|The boy in the striped pajamas  is  Great ad tragic read. It is worth looking into. Provides great history an  enjoyment.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I like it would be better if it could be more accessible when I am working internationally that is only down side to this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome you get to jump on trains collect coins and other awesome things it's like temple run but cooler
B00APUQPX6|5.0|My nephews and nieces loved it had some strange humor the kids enjoyed it after renting it had to purchase a blue ray copy
B00004RJ71|5.0|Wonderful movie! Keeps u on the edge of ur seat til the end. Takes u on a rollercoaster ride thru the plot and has an unexpected ending. Definitely recommended. One of my all time favorite movies! You wont be disappointed! Warning - some violent scenes but it makes the movie more real.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Fantastic imagery, no trouble picturing the places or events. Interesting concepts. Somewhat distracting to keep straight if you've read the Twilight series.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I stumbled upon this movie yesterday at a local RedBox and the description interested me. I watched it twice and awoke this morning thinking deeply on the movie. It is all about love, sharing love and learning how to love. It shows a moment in the life of two men, each learning from the other and as they do, they influence those around them in the important things in life: love and friendship. I understand that there is a Hollywood remake planned. I think it is a mistake to try to cash in on a movie already perfectly done. I do not think it can be improved upon and kudos should go to all involved in this excellent work. Highly recommended!
B00513DGIO|1.0|The starting point of the book is wrong. The conflation of debt and obligation is an incorrect premise which yields an approach that just degenerates into another rant against an economic system that while it may well be incorrectly applied at times, does work.
B002JODPSO|4.0|I have seen Die Hard since the first one and they just keep getting better. This one is good for the twist and turns in it - also the numerous edge of your seat situations.
B001J4E1D8|5.0|This movie was beautifully made.  Some minor things were left out from the book but nothing that changed the true story.  All the actors did an amazing job, especially the actress who played Tess.  The scenery and music were terrific.  Even though I know the story, I was still tearing up because the actors played their parts so well and really provided emotional feeling to the characters.  The ending still haunts me, from the book as well, as this story is so tragic, yet beautiful.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|The first thing that's striking about Madeleine's voice (at least to me) is that she sounds more like Billie Holiday than Billie Holiday did...without ever imitating her. Because let's face it: it's not possible to mimic that utterly unique tone. Whatever fate laid it's wonderful hands on Peyroux's voice to give it that quality, it's just one of nature's peculiar miracles.<br /><br />I love almost all of her CD's, but could not get a grasp on \\"Bare Bones\\" or \\"Standing on the Rooftop.\\" But until \\"The Blue Room\\" there has not been a 100% faultless gem of musical choices. This is it. Absolutely great from the first notes to the last, a gorgeously original fusion of post-modern jazz/blues with a tinge of country. Whoever thought the song \\"Gentle On My Mind\\" could bring tears to your eyes? I cannot stop listening to it. Even the CD booklet is a work of art.<br /><br />Visit the lovely, lonely \\"Blue Room.\\" You'll never want to leave. Thank you, producer Larry Klein and Madeleine for this extraordinary recording.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I am annoyed that my five year old has to have friends with the app to get certain ponies, like my five year old has facebook or Twitter. The game is fun though.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is a nice way to be able to have the scriptures handy and I love the daily readins, fitness program and Bible in the Year plan.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|Interesting and shocking. It's a great way to get into Marilyn Manson's mind and learn his side of the story with his bizarre rise to take. But in the end you realise it's all shock value for nothing more than being famous. Sure, he's different, and life happens, but he's really no more than a make up covered rock star like all the rest. Well written though
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I like that they changed the storyline from the original.<br /><br />However, the plodding way in which they get to the final scene had me looking at my watch.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|great game ;berry addicting fun. mustvplay fast laced game recomenend.you. will really like this game. have fun trying to get a high score
B0059DL0UC|5.0|My wife, who is a pilates instructor was really chuffed by the book.  She assures me it is very useful
B00BKTFABE|2.0|Because it is a free app I should rate it 5 stars however, I am going to uninstall it and then buy a paid Camera app....<br /><br />I has no options other than to snap a photo.  Last night I snapped a photo and a &#34;fake&#34; bright shadow (if you will) gleamed over the picture as if there was a flash on the camera. ...... soooooooooo awful
B007T7MIR0|5.0|I use this just for emails that have attachments in Word or Excel. I can save these files when I'm out of the office, then download them to my PC.
1451648537|5.0|Just awesome, no doubts. Shipping and Delivery... Like A charm. This Book Is Too Interesting If You Really Want To Know the True Origin of Apple With All The Details
0988178532|5.0|I loved this book!  It was fast and fun and I learned a ton!  I finished it a week or so ago and I can't stop thinking about the characters, that is how you know it's a good book!  With a lot of books you can guess how it is going to end, not with this one!  I was surprised with every twist and turn and I have no idea what is going to happen in the next book, I just know I can't wait to read it!
B00936A2SM|4.0|This is a pretty energetic effort, and I enjoyed the interplay of the trio. Scott Henderson is great as always, and great arrangements of Weather Report and Wayne Shorter tunes. Good interesting choices for a fusion power trio to tackle.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|my kids love angry birds and this version is absolutely their favorite! i love how it has a line to show u where the bird will land
B00650SSWG|3.0|cute but not at all memorable or special.  a one time movie...not worthy of several runs.  just ok not more
B005KDJCE2|4.0|One of the best new prog-rock bands out there.Very good vocals and music.I would recommend this to FLOYD fans as i am.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is.just the beginning to the game.I love it especially the tour hope you all enjoy by the way I so love the charecters
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great way to fill any free time, plenty of games to choose from. both fun and challenging games.  some are more challenging than others
B008VBYN80|4.0|I like the game sort of like world at arms. Can't put it down. Only problem is that I can't do the lottery so well.
B009E3EY38|5.0|As any Led Zeppelin fanatic knows, this release was delayed for several years. Within a few days of the show, fan-made I-Phone Edits from various camera shots around the O2 Arena were making the rounds, within a few weeks several audiophile audience tape sources were in file-sharing sites and available from Far Eastern bootleggers.  Then, about 2 years ago, a rehearsal tape surfaced, which was in many people's opinion, superior to the actual O2 Performance... meanwhile, those of us not lucky enough to win the ticket lottery wondered if we'd ever get to see it released anywhere other than a bootlegger's DVD...<br /><br />So now we finally have it, and it has been worth the wait! The filming and sound recording was (of course) better than any of the bootlegs, the CD sounds great, the DVD sounds and looks great, and they even threw in a stationary camera filming of one of their rehearsals that's never been seen before anywhere, not on bootleg DVD, CD, or a fan-sharing torrent site. Granted, it's not as good a performance as the previously mentioned performance tape, but it's a bonus-- the real meat and potatoes is the O2 Reunion DVD, and that, in and of itself, is certainly a reason for a &#34;Celebration Day&#34; (even if that Led Zeppelin song was inexplicably not present in the performance).<br /><br />Jimmy Page has given us fans the best package of the O2 Reunion that's ever been seen. If this truly was the last flight of the mighty Led Zeppelin, Mr. Page and Co. have definitely stepped off the stage leaving a high-water mark to make up for the rather poor showings at their Live Aid and Atlantic 40th Annivesary reunions. Highly recommended!
1452113432|3.0|The book is very well written and the pictures are great. Unfortunately, I found the recipes to be a little bland, which is a shame because I love making French food. The gluten free onion and creme fraiche tart was pretty gross, but would probably be ok if you just used regular dough. The croque madam muffins were good, but a little too heavy on the nutmeg. The cheese souffle was a little bland. The duck with fizzy orange turned out good. Unfortunately for me, there are quite a few pages dedicated to sweets and pastries which I don't really care for, but I'm sure I'm in the minority on that. Overall, not a bad book, but not as good as some of the other french cookbooks I have.
1609611543|2.0|I purchased this book because I thought it would give more insight to why gluten (a product in wheat) is bad for you.  The further I got in the book the more I realized the author is talking more about how carbs in general affect your blood sugar and health, not just &#34;wheat&#34;.  I had been substituting gluten-free flours, etc... thinking that would help.  Well I've only lost 2lbs in 3 weeks, by not eating wheat but eating other carbs.  I would have given just one star but I really appreciate all the information about different carbs other than wheat.  The author did a lot of good research.  I'm vegan and it's hard enough to be low-carb.  I guess I'll be on the hunt for another book that talks specifically about how wheat itself is bad for you, not carbs.  Interesting read though.  Learned some new things but it just wasn't what I was looking for.
B0048Y9TPG|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I love this record, Mariah will always be number one as far as I'm concerned.  You know she is a great vocalist, songwriter, and many, many things I can keep on going, but this record doesn't have the same feel as the 1st Merry Christmas she made in 1994.  But before you don't purchase it, please purchase it because you certainly will not regret it. She does a fantastic job on this record, and it is great to add to your Mariah Carey record collection, and even if you don't have an MC record collection, it is still top notch, top of the line Christmas album by the brilliant Mariah Carey.  Definitely,a keeper.
B004OC07F8|4.0|This is a good book. learning how to create a way to look beyond the competition, businesses can then become more viable and stronger. That was the beginning of the book. here is why i gave it four stars. While I liked the principles placed in the beginning of the book, unfortunately, the last four chapters were not too much use for me, as I am working on a business by myself. But for others who have quite a few employees, this would really be beneficial in taking your company to the next level. If I do hire employees I will definitely go over the last four chapters again.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is fun and kind of like the movie if you like anything jurassic park you will love this game
B0067R0APK|4.0|This is the best weather app available.  However, they redesigned it to show weather data graphically at the top of each page.  This takes up valuable room on the screen and it's still too small to interpret anyway.  I'd rather just have the hourly or daily information without the graph.  At least I don't have to contend with ads at the bottom of the screen with the paid version!  And all those graphics take bandwidth to download, so I frequently get an error message.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|I started watching SOA and cannot seen to stop watching.  Each episode leaves you needing to watch the next.  Great watch, over acting in parts but I get pass that fast.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This watch is a good quality timepiece and it is keeping perfect time. It has a nice rugged look and the Seiko craftsmanship is evident. This is a great watch for the money.
B00829GFZ0|5.0|This is the album that their first 2 LPs and self titled EP had been building to, it's perfect from start to finish.  They are by far the most over looked band in the U.S. right now, although that might change very soon.  I highly recommend their first 3 releases as they are also some of the best rock 'n' roll albums to be released since the 70s.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|the music from the movie has to be listened to while watching the film(which I thoroughly enjoyed).  this is not true of the stage production where the original cast album is filled with great voices.  not so the film.
B003JTHWPA|4.0|The main character is a deaf-mute, who is given the privilege of listening to the beating hearts of four other searching souls during the end of the American Depression in the deep South.  Each of the five characters is wishing for something that is out-of-reach due to difficult circumstances in their individual lives.  Each heart searches in vain for what it passionately desires.  The deaf-mute could be compared to the Almighty; for, each of the other characters tell him about each of their passionate desires.  This is much like someone praying.... we do not physically hear the answer to prayer, but, often when we least expect it, the answer appears in a wholly unexpected way.  Thus, the deaf-mute helps each of the other characters to cope with unfulfilled passionate desire.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|while the smart-ass comments were clever at times, the peppering throughout made me skim to get to the action.  a lot of repetition was distracting and unnecessary..
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Even though this is a work of fiction, it shows something true about the Catholic Church in Ireland that has persisted for at least a century.  There are a few comic moments in the romantic movements, but it is the alternating chapters of the book that illustrate the practices of the Church with respect to child labor under very strict, harsh standards.  Perhaps more than just the citizens of Ireland need to know about these.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I thought the days of good fantasy stories were long past with The lord of the Rings. Here is  a story with magic, swords, fighting between kingdoms, and mystical creatures. For sounding like a typical medevil kind of series it is far more brutal and real than others. Including gore, the hacking of limbs, deceit, secret affairs, blood lust, booze and whores. It is an exciting thrill ride that captivates you into watching exactly as the title claims it to be a 'Game of Thrones'.
B00ALYY6ZA|1.0|No doubt this will be another big seller.  Hey, I bought it.  In retrospect it was one of my more foolish purchases.<br /><br />No doubt the good doctor lost weight.  Twice a week eat only two meals/day, very low calorie, avoiding sugar and the usual suspects.  And this constitutes fasting how?  His co-author Mimi, a fashion journalist, helpfully advises what snacks to eat if you get peckish between those meals--she likes apples.  And this constitutes fasting how?  In other words, the whole thing is a bit of a mess, fleshed out with various low cal recipes.<br /><br />The theory and research about intermittent fasting is interesting.  It just doesn't seem have much to do with what they are recommending that we do, which is fundamentally to eat better and (averaging out the calories over a week) less.  In reality, it should be called the Eat Less On Two Days Each Week Diet.  Not exactly earth-shaking, that.
B00821OX98|4.0|This show starts after it all occur with aliens invading the earth, and its a little boring but it gets interesting as the episodes evolve. as I am into season two it does not seem to lead to anything concrete. I would like to think that this will be like 'V' the 1970's alien show.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|The only issue was the climax - it didn't make sense. I believe this way due to the funding of the film, they did not have enough, as reported by Katsuhiro Otomo in an interview found in the Collector's Edition of this film.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read all three books!!!!! Left me wanting more!! Can't wait until the next trilogy by E L James.  Could not get through the pages quick enough!
B000005Z0G|3.0|The sounds of the early 90's were heavily focused on dancing, I think this hindered Tupac Shakur more than helped him. There are many recognizable songs to the average rap fan but I think his music was stifled a lot from the underground music he released.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a very simple but fun app. It is appropriate for young children so parents have the option of playing the game with their children.
B000P0J09C|4.0|No movie will ever depict the violence and hatred found in war, some documentaries have skillfully shown the real casualties of war. For a fictional film, Kubrick does an excellent job in portraying the youth of the time - the ilm takes place during the Vietnam war. Recommended!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app because I aways watch my cousin on his xbox360 so I wanted to try it out
6304493681|4.0|The movie is well crafted and uniquely made, however, Japanese culturenhas a different expression on sex and nudity. I think a lot of the nudity of the female cyborg isn't necessary. There isn't anything pornographic but the openness of nudity is prevelant in Japanese culture, seemingly regardless of age.
1616550414|5.0|It was very informative about the Legend of Zelda franchise. There is literally nothing to know about the Legend of Zelda that isn't in this book. If it's not in there, it's not Zelda.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|Very well made and produced but it doesn't have an ambitious plot like the first film had. It delivers new CGI with amazingly crafted animation but lacks a story line. Overall, its a great film in action and some of the disturbing philosophy it presents about humans and machines. I recommend getting the version that has the American voice cast from the series of Ghost In The Shell!
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Joe Abercrombie easily ranks in my top five fantasy authors and this book is a prime example of why. Well-fleshed out characters, a brisk plot, and some of the wittiest exchanges I've run across in the medium, all in a setting nigh on devoid of magic. This is a book that is hard to set down once you pick it up. Heartily recommended.
