B004HWYTP4|5.0|I only rented because I wanted to see it before going to see Red 2. I absolutely loved it. Watched it twice and it was just as good the second time. Highly recommend this one.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This was a great family movie to be watched by all. Very believable and heart warming - all a the same time.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I like to see originals before watching the movies or any more current versions.  I especially love the 1960's special effects!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|While Tom Cruise found a role that shows equal amounts of being an actor and being an action hero. The story has great legs, and Cruise does a good job of keeping viewers engaged. The Story is a slow paced and methodical suspense that can at times get slower and start to feel too drawn out. However if you like a good story with action and suspense like I do, then this might be something you would like. I give it 4 stars because there is not an overuse of gratuitous sex and violence. In fact, sex is minimal and violence is more or less implied and left to the imagination in most scenes, and those scenes do it really well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the larger size on the kindle fire Is great, the game is very addictive, I play the game every chance I get
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Thanks is a very good weather app and I feel like they stay on top of th<br />weaver I can trust it.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Great game. Got me into the game and always wanted to play more. Always interesting and fun, seemed like the game was always slightly changing. Very fun and easy to play.
B0092ZEIN4|2.0|The controller was smaller than I would have liked, even for travel. The joy sticks are not actual thumb sticks but little sliders. I did like like using it and returned the item.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show definitely had me on the edge of my seat many times.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a little psychological &#34;horror.&#34;  It is not scary, but very fun!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|It is a collection that can not miss on the shelves of science fiction fans. The sound is incredible as well as the image. My favorite ... Alien. Although it is the oldest, for me is the best of the entire saga.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This was such a great show-- I loved the drama and the comedy. It's a real shame it was canceled!!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I'm a Christian, and this was a very good Christian movie, this movie was uplifting to the Body of Christ, a blessing to the Lord Jesus
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This guy is right up there with the best story tellers. Found it very hard to put this book down. The only problem I found was that it came to an end. Can't wait for Mr. Ryan's next installment. He doesn't have to do anything different, the groove he is in is perfect!!!!!!
034580404X|5.0|I waited 21/2 years to get the books because for its reputation.  However, if, 70 million plus have read the book there must be something to it.  I was surprised that the story was not bad and as an adult the sex could be tolerated, in fact it made me want to be 35 years younger.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Its worth 4 hours to sit through this film.  Incredibly well done.  It will make you want to visit Gettysburg, PA
B00AZMFO9U|3.0|Poor ending.  It needed more music, we were short changed here.  Some parts humorous, but in the end this is a forgettable movie.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|This was a great movie that complimented the book very well. Very good acting and beautiful scenes. Everyone will enjoy watching.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|not a guide to life, but a comical approach to how life changes when a baby is on the way. at some points this movie was pretty predictable but it was still a good watch.
0738212415|4.0|I paint and wanted to improve my art and I am sooo tried of TV, I decided to improve my drawing by practicing at night.  I went through the book in about two weeks and have learned a little more, so it was worth the time.
B006QV30JU|5.0|Loved this oldie but goodie nice love story along with good music and magic<br />Cal footwork by Gene Kelly. Acting great!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This is simply the best album Vince Gill has ever made - and he has made alot over the past 25+ years.  This is true traditional country music at its best, and Vince does it perfectly.  It brings me back to the heyday of the Bakersfield sound with Buck, Merle, Wynn and Tommy (Collins). What a great sound this was!  Any rating less than 5 stars for this album would be a crime. Thank you, Vince, for giving us this treasure.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this 3rd in Sylvia Day's crossfire series. I'm enraptured with the story line an the major erotic moments in all of the books. Love all the sex, passion and love mixed with a plot line.  Can't wait for next one. Hurry up Sylvia !!!!
0812550706|5.0|I loved this book! Great summer reading about how Ender was recruited and trained to lead a war in space. The movie is scheduled for later this year and if its even close as to how good the book is, I look forward to it. Ender, family, and characters at the academy are all developed well throughout the story and the ending did not drag on, as in some stories. You can easily see why so many sci-fi fans rate Ender's Game as one of the best books ever.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|This album/band is fantastic.  I bought the whole album based off of only hearing 'Royals', and am in love with their sound and vibe.  Great buy!!
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Bang, Crash & some Cool SFX what more do you want in a shoot'em up spy, CIA secret agent movie. I did have to turn on my &#34;suspend disbelief&#34; filter once or twice, but thats true these days for many movies,  but still worth the price. So be it to say, I am  willing to now go see the sequel, so how bad can it be?
B00873GRU4|4.0|Not a completely fresh concept but a great treatment of it nevertheless. I found the writing to be of reasonable quality and Howey does a good job of characterization.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|Saw the band in concert, wanted their most recent cd, can listen to all songs without having to forward to a specific song
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Then you'll love this mini-series. A more professional and dramatic version of the goings-on in government. Gripping to the very end.
1781162646|4.0|The story itself was good but it dragged out and dragged out until it was hard to read.  It didn't keep me awake at night like his stories usually do.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I bought this mic after reading a few reviews. I didnt think it was going to be the best mic on the planet, but it is a nice mic for sure!!! I clipped it on and plugged it into my Zoom H4n recorder and I was surprised how good it actually sounded.

B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|I love this app. I am twelve years old and this app is exactly what I needed to record the fireman sam theme song &lt;3 I love kid shows, and fireman sam is my favorite. Without this brilliant app, I would always have to go to YouTube just to listen to his theme song.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I like the way he has argued his premises on this regard. I learned a lot about the original context that Jesus as a person came from back 2000 years ago. Thanks Reza
0790749858|5.0|Thank you so much!! My son has been waiting on me to get this for him!! And he was very pleased!!!
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Part Kurosawa, part Martin, part Tarantino, Joe Abercrombie is a master storyteller. His characters pop off the page with humor, anger and depth.<br />Buy all his books!! NOW!
B00AIBZM40|3.0|it was ok. it is one of those movies where it has to be completely dark to understand the atmosphere, which in my opinion, is the best thing about this movie. honestly, its not that great, but, i have seen worse. i will also say, i watched it and i wont again.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can read my kindle books anywhere now since getting a Samsung Galaxy S3 as my phone.  One of the only reasons I purchased a smart phone. :-)
B00013M6NK|3.0|This battery works but will not charge up completely. It was cheap and I got what I paid for. Not a bad product for the money.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is just wHen to addictive it is hard to put down once you start. Great game to pass the time with that is for sure and lots off ppl since it is also a Facebook game
B003SJ4NRG|4.0|Giggles for all ages. The dad (Brendan Fraser) appears to go overboard, but then don't we all every now and then.  Watched this multiple times when it just came out, but remembered it again after a family camping trip and couldn't resist purchasing the instant video from Amazon. Fun, fun, fun!
B00991TCOG|5.0|My 9 year old daughter calls this happy music. This is very uplifting. I will order more of her music in the future.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Lots of good songs.reminds me of disco music. If you like daft punk, this is a good album. Good buy
B0090SI582|5.0|I went to see The Wolverine and was expecting it to be just an average entertaining film.  It was better than that.  It is not a high energy roller coster ride like some of the previous X-men movies.  This film starts out more slowly and develops Wolverine's character.  Cinematography in Japan was nicely shot.  As the movie progresses, the suspense and action of the movie keep fans captivated.  This year for the movies has been disappointing so I am glad to say it was worth the money to see The Wolverine in the theater.  I am looking forward to adding this movie to my film collection.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game!! I really enjoy playing and am glad I got this app.  It's a great way to get you thinking.
1575666286|4.0|This book has a lot of useful information in it.  I haven't had a chance to go through all of it but I'm sure it will be very useful in the future. Thank you

B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never lets you down.  You simply can not go wrong with any book or movie he's behind ! This entire movie beginning to end was just fabulous!!  Mystery,  suspense,  romance,  action . Superb!! I loved it!

B009AMANH4|5.0|Daniel d.Lewis is an excellent actor yes some liberties were taking however that's to be expected. I enjoyed the story it was entertainment. no more no less.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|if you like math games this one is great! it is more fun than the book because it will change colors to let you know you have done your math correctly.
B00701L5XS|5.0|This program not only teaches how to tie a myriad of knots for every conceivable application but also gives the history and most common uses. The function that allows the viewer to slow the lesson down and view from any angle is simply incredible! Everything I was looking for and more! Great for novices and pros alike.
0142000671|3.0|I have read other works by Steinbeck and this story certainly depicts the era he uses as the setting for this work.  my disappoint-ment was  the  transparency of  the plot.  character  development was interesting and spot on for those  times.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found this game alot of fun .  But it just did not last Long enough. So I had to give it a 4. Hope to get up days soon.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|a very fine and complete cross section of all of his works from the biggest hits{recordings}  to the not so well known tunes.

B0015AARJI|1.0|I am very very disappointed I was under the impression that I was purchasing a used controller not a partially working one! the center console  button does not work the joy stick are like new but the button the is spring loaded in the left analog switch is only working sometime and I have to have to charge it every half hour! I have since found out that every controller sold by this this seller are fakes Do Not Buy!
B00992CF6W|4.0|IT's a awsome game but there's to much cliches. Minecraft omost broke my kindle<br />Like my friend Isabel found 15 iron and when she took it out of the furnace it was gone.Also I had 5 buckets and when I logged on to my kindle to play minecraft they were gone!:(!Sorry I'm being so negative.

0066621003|3.0|Good to Great by Jim Collins was written in 2001 and was a huge success selling over two million copies. It is a breezy work about how few good companies make the leap to becoming great. It was an enjoyable book when I received it at a business workshop. This 300 page book has 9 chapters in it. While it has aged somewhat Jim's message is quite good. He talks about getting the right people on the bus and the wrong ones off. He identifies eleven companies: Abbott, Circuit City, Fannie Mae, Gillette, Kimberly-Clark, Kroger, Nucor, Philip Morris, Pitney Bowes, Walgreen's, and Wells Fargo. Competitors for each company were given profiles to determine the characteristics of companies that break through to huge success.<br /><br />Jim's message is simple and his research is quite good. Since I devour financial information I appreciated the research but when I went to re-read it I found it quite long-winded. I can't say I learned many new things but what I did learn was concise, accurate and informative. Many people in my circle of influence were affected by the ideas presented. My only complaints are that there are a few too many examples and not enough specific recommendations. Jim could have provided more of an action plan or reduced the size of the book. Some parts are written a little bit too casually. In some ways, everyone should read it once because the advice does make sense. It is a surprisingly easy read. Collins adds a few metaphors into the conversation such as \\"Level 5 Leadership\\" and the \\"tortoise and the fox\\" analogy. Overall, many business leaders consider this the bible of people management. It could use an update now but the research is accurate as of the book's printing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a great app for just hanging i is so worth the price it can do so much then i thought all my siblings love it we multiplayer all the time i is worth it.  IT IS WORTH IT :)
1451648537|4.0|I must admit reading about Steve Jobs has been very insightful. This authorized biography is an interesting look at the life of Steve Jobs. Isaacson writes in an informative manner throughout. He pulls no punches regarding criticism of Jobs. The book paints Jobs as both larger than life and also tragically flawed. It isn't quite the page turner I was expecting as I have stopped and put it down from time to time. Some chapters are more interesting than others and Isaacson shows his biases in his analysis of other people affected by Jobs. Steve Wozniak is not taken very seriously nor is Michael Eisner shown in a particularly flattering way. That's fine but a more balanced perspective could even the text out somewhat. Though many passages will turn the reader off \\"Steve Jobs the Man\\" he has toned down many of the criticisms that have come to light (and still are being revealed) because Jobs himself was both better and worse than he is presented in the text. Jobs was an ideal person to write a tell-all biography because the man was anything but dull. Some of his failures have also been brushed over.<br /><br />Since I put the book down a few times I was tempted to rate it 3 stars but I have since returned to it and found many eye-opening details. The author picks his spots describing some situations in excruciating detail while other important events are ignored or given light treatment. It's not as scholarly as you might expect and seems almost like a journal in some sections. The book starts slowly but gets much better toward the end. The early years are something of a drag but the book finishes strongly describing the events shortly before the death of Jobs. Steve's second tenure at Apple, his Pixar days and his health crisis are the best parts of the book. Some of the stories will outright shock you. His abandonment of his daughter (and her mother), his narcissistic and overbearing personality, his personal vendettas with key figures, and Jobs' relationship with his family are all compelling but heartbreaking. Towards the end you may wonder why Isaacson chose to portray Jobs in such an unflattering way. He answers that question by noting Laurene Powell (wife of Jobs) requested both sides of Jobs' personality be accounted for in his biography. Jobs fits the profile of a mad genius who was out of control early in his life and cancer didn't change him much. He was a visionary but also a very flawed individual who could be unbearable for colleagues and family members at times. Apple will have a hard time innovating and boosting its stock price without Jobs around.<br /><br />Buy this book.family are all compelling but heartbreaking.

B004KPX4W2|5.0|It was recommended by visiting relatives and it was well worth it! Just a fun, fun flick. You can tell the actors had a great time making it and it carried through the screen.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I have the first Bose sound dock for an iPod.  It doesn't have any auxiliary ports, so I was stuck using it with an ipod.  Unfortunately, I haven't used an ipod in years.  So that left me with an awesome speaker that I could not use.  Enter this little item.  It works perfect.  I use it with my kindle fire hd, and the remote for the bose still works only for volume.  This was worth every penny.  Now I can hear my music the way it's supposed to be heard.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Invictus is a movie about sports that is not about sports - it is a movie about forgiveness, about moving ahead as if there is trust and good will when there is no trust and good will.<br /><br />It is life-changing, the practical application of Christ's principles in a world impossibly troubled, a world beyond redemption by human principles of intervention.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I think I've heard one of Susan Boyle's songs on TV but this isn't something I'd buy but I remember this lady sings really good.<br />My 85 year old Mom loves this singer so I just get Mom what she likes.

B00821PCJS|5.0|I really enjoyed this series & can't wait to start watching season 2. It really kept my interest & normally I wouldn't watch this sort of science fiction but it was well done, suspenseful & something different. The actors are great, I love Noah Wylie.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I missed the movie when it was in the theatres; but I had heard about it from friends.  It was a nice diversion from the ordinary.  Lots of little jokes throughout the movie makes me want to watch it again.
B0082Z447U|5.0|i liked the time period and the twists and turns.  knew from the start that it was going to be a happy ending because of the style but it surprised me all the same.
B00BAYLRNO|3.0|Amazing tale of survival, however once the tsunami hits and the movie centers on the aftermath, which is most of the film, you are subjected to scene after scene of open wounds and infection that become the focus of the visual experience.  Yes, there is some reference to people helping others during this horrifying ordeal, however you are going to be covering your eyes and cringing during the scenes of disease, vomiting, and open wounds.  I'm sure this was factual, which may have attributed to this, however it would have been nice to see more human interaction.  And when the movie is over, you see a quick photo of the actual family the movie is documenting, but no further information.  Would have been nice to have had a quick bio of how they are today and where life took them after their ordeal.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Part of the problem with the zombie apocalypse, is that it has been told before. The great thing that this show does is tells the story of the people, just trying to survive. It isn't about putting bullets into as many zombies as possible, or why it happened in the first place. First and foremost, it is a story about people put into a horrible situation.  We watch as they either rise up to be great and just people, or  sink down into the darkness and become the most vile human beings imaginable. But it isn't always black and white, good and bad. Sometimes the best this group of survivors can hope for, is the moral grey.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I wish that I could give this book to myself as a child so that the story and images would have always been a part of me. This book is special: lovely and mesmerizing. I am grateful to have read it.
1609611543|5.0|This book was a great help to me, further convincing me of the importance of removing wheat from mine and my family's diet.  It is full of information, but tends to get pretty wordy and science-heavy.  If you aren't good with that kid of read, buy it for someone who is, then ask them for the synopsis!  Everyone should have this information!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I can't say I'm a die hard comic/marvel fan or even a really good dork, but I do enjoy most of these movies (I don't/haven't read the comics if that gives you an idea of what audience I'm in).  So that said, I probably didn't have high standards or expectations and would say I was easily pleased.  I've watched Iron man, all the x-men movies, captain America, and so forth so I enjoyed it as much as I did those.  I can't give you smart comments about the plot lines, special effects, directing, whatever.  Action-packed and a bit nerdy so I was all set!  I'd watch it a few more times.
B009178OQA|3.0|The passion and the labor and dedication is all there, well illustrated, clear to the viewer, but then the point is belabored and the audience is brow-beaten.  We understand that he's never done, never satisfied, a perfectionist and almost a tyrant, but we got that in the first 45 minutes.<br />The movie becomes quite joyless later on, his sons are miserable, Jiro never smiles.  Does perfection have to be so sad?<br />I kept asking myself, (I love sushi and will go to great lengths and expense to experience the food of great chefs), &#34;who the heck would want to spend $400 per person to eat his (presumably unbelievable) food in his grim, cramped, starkly lit, underground sushi bar?&#34; If dinner with Jiro is worth $400, The French Laundry is the best bargain on the planet.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This is a gift. The product arrived as stated by seller and arrived in good condition. Since the package has not been opened and played I can not speak futher on it.
B000SOZXJG|5.0|I have seen this movie 3 or 4 times, and I never get tired of it.  It's a bit of a fairy tale, but very well done, and the Maori culture is beautiful.  Watch it with your kids when they're old enough to sit thru a 2 hour movie that's not animated.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I saw the concert on PBS and I had to have it.  I have already watched parts of it four times and will continue to listen for a long time.

0425266060|5.0|I loved this series even better than Fifty Shades! In two weeks time I had read all three books. I actually read the 3rd one in a day! I can't wait until the next book!
B004CURZFC|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughter.  She has read the entire Wolves of the Beyond Series and I just bought her the Guardians of Ga'Hoole Series as well.  She has not started them, but she is very interested.  I bought this DVD from Amazon and it came with a free digital copy.  I watched that yesterday and I actually enjoyed the movie.  I know my daughter (9) will love it.  It's not cheesy and has a good story line to it.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Okay movie for kids, but nothing special as far as I was concerned. John C. Reilly did do a nice job however.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|For the &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; English-movie fancy-pants crowd. Maybe got panned. But good story, very positive at the end. For the right, calm, person, very nice film. Not for everyone.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Every time I finish reading a Mortal Instruments book, I think to myself &#34;Wow, this one was amazing! Definitely my favorite, there is no way the next one can top it. Nope, no way.&#34; I guess now that I am on the third installment, I should know better. City of Glass was such a great, fast paced, action paced, and fun read. I mean come on, we get to visit THE CITY OF GLASS! It sounds like such a beautiful place from the descriptions mentioned in books one and two, and I was so excited that we get to travel to this unknown place.<br /><br />I love the introduction of this new character, whose name I will not mention cause of spoilers :P. This character really puts a new perspective on the story, and what he/she will reveal will shock you. I know I couldn't flip through the pages fast enough! I always think that I know how everything will turn out, but Cassandra C. loves to throw those curve balls that keeps me on my toes...and I love it!<br /><br />As far as romance goes, this book is pretty sweet. I love Jace and Clary, and all I want is for them to be together already dangit! I like how Cassandra C. gives us a lot of action in her stories; yet, there are rare moments where we get these truly beautiful and romantic moments that really make me smile...*one of those huge idiot looking grins*. She's never over top, and I like that despite the fact that Clary and Jace truly love one another, they have their own thoughts and worries that does not revolve around the other person 24/7.<br /><br />This book was fantastic! Answering some questions that have been lingering throughout the past two stories, and giving us more questions and situations to ponder over.<br /><br />I really enjoyed City of Glass, I love the change of scenery and the addition of new and fabulous characters.<br /><br />I want to say that this is my favorite one so far...but then again, I'm going to start on City of Fallen Angels soon...so we shall see about that (;<br /><br />Cassandra C, does not disappoint, and once again I am neglecting all of my other books because of the TMI series! :X<br /><br />-as seen on my goodreads account
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is what TV should be, quality acting and great storyline...need more episodes on Prime!  Season 3 needs to be pushed to Prime!
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|Maggie Stiefvater, why oh why do you torture me so?<br /><br />I really liked Shiver, and the secluded small town feel of Mercy Falls. I was SO HAPPY that Sam came back at the end of Shiver, even if I knew that this happiness would be short lived. To my surprise, I didn't realize how short lived that would be. I really like both Grace and Sam, and especially like Grace and Sam together...but it seems as if they are star crossed lovers.<br /><br />Now that I have ranted about wanting Sam and Grace to finally be happy...I can go on about what I did enjoy about Linger.<br /><br />I adore Isabelle, and was glad to see her snarky and over the top attitude back in action. I was glad that she got to narrate in this book, and found her chapters really engaging and interesting to read. Cole-I really liked his character as well, a detached yet at the same time lonely musician. It's refreshing to get a point of view from someone who actually wants to be a wolf, and his reasons, although unrealistic are quite understandable.<br /><br />I like that this book ends on a cliff hanger, and I really don't know what to expect from Forever. What I do know; however, is that I cannot wait to read it.

B002JWD6AS|4.0|Shiver, hooked me right from the very first page-and that's saying a lot. There wasn't a lot going on, but what was happening was so strange and it made me want to continue on. I also have a fascination with wolves-I think they are beautiful, and at the same time frightening-definitely a dangerous combo.<br /><br />I love the world of Mercy Falls, and I am definitely envious that Grace has a freaking forest for a backyard! Grace is a 17 year old girl, who feels as if she doesn't fit in-I think we can all relate. She feels a deeper connection with the wolves, than she does with human beings-one wolf in particular, with yellow eyes-Sam.<br /><br />LOVE LOVE LOVE Sam. He is so sweet, strong, and respectful. Yet at the same time, he is brave and good natured, always trying to what is best. Reading about his past will break your heart, and I still feel uncomfortable reading about his childhood.<br /><br />Sam and Grace are kind of like star crossed lovers, knowing that the chances of them not being together are greater than the chances of them being together. Yet, like Sam and Grace-I didn't want to accept this, I continued to support them and hoped by some miracle that things would end up okay.<br /><br />Love how Maggie S. gives a new meaning to werewolves: how they turn, what makes them turn, what it feels like to be a wolf, what you remember, what you don't, ect.<br /><br />This small and cozy town of Mercy Falls sounds absolutely beautiful, like a winter wonderland as cheesy as that might soun<br /><br />-as seen on my goodreads account
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this alarm for work days when I have to get up extra early. Unlike my last alarm, it doesn't wake my husband but gets just loud enough to wake me on my side of the bed. I like how it starts soft and gets louder rather than a rude awakening.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|*WARNING: CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS*<br /><br />First off, like many of you guys out there, I was told that this book was nothing short of excellent and I would devour it. And let's just say, this book was absolutely adorable and I really enjoyed it to say the least. There were some problems with it, that is why it received four instead of five stars but those problems weren't so drastic that I wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />I guess I'll start with what I didn't like:<br />[<br />Eleanor.<br /><br />Yes, I said it. How could I not like her you ask?<br /><br />Well, to be fair it wasn't that I didn't like her, it was just that I didn't really feel like she developed as a character. Her home life breaks my heart, I cannot imagine going through what she went through. Her mom, goodness, made me SO MAD. I get that some women are submissive, but she has children that she needs to think of! How can she be okay with Richie calling Eleanor a bitch, and not defend her own daughter? The whole invasion of privacy from not having a bathroom door, and having to share a room with all of her brothers and sisters was really sad. WAIT A MINUTE, I am losing focus here. Okay, back to what I was saying: I totally feel for Eleanor, I really do. I wish I could just scoop her up, and take her somewhere safe because she is that precious.<br /><br />But at the same time, aside from her home life, I didn't really connect or understand her. She is always getting mad at Park for asking about her past and personal life; yet, she expects him to answer all of her burning questions. Like for example, the whole Tina thing. Now, Park obviously cares about her and is willing to answer any questions she might have but when it came to Tina he repeatedly said that he doesn't want to talk about their past. Yet, Eleanor kept on pushing and he had to tell her. It seemed like she was always getting mad at him, for things that aren't his fault. And he took like a freaking saint, always so sweet and understanding.<br /><br />Also, the ending PISSED ME OFF. Like what the heck? I get that she is probably freaked out by finding out her step dad is not only a drunk and sadist, but a soon to be molester was well and she needed time to think. But I don't get why she couldn't call Park, or write to him to let him know how she is? He did so much for her, the least she can do is give him that reassurance. I really didn't understand, I feel as if Park cared more for her than she did for him.<br /><br />I absolutely adore Park's character however. First off, I know he was always insecure about the way he looked but he sounds absolutely gorgeous being mixed with Korean and Irish.<br /><br />I love his relationship with his parents, and how even though he and his dad do not see eye to eye sometimes, they both really love one another. Props to Park, for wearing eyeliner though. I loved that. Not the eyeliner per say, but the fact that being with Eleanor (who loves to dress up in gaudy clothing) made him realize how brave she is, brave because she doesn't care what other people think. She gave him that strength to wear eyeliner, and kick Steve's ass.<br /><br />He was always so sweet, understanding, kind, and funny. I know why she would like him, but I don't really get what's so great about Eleanor. She is quirky and they have interesting conversations, but I didn't think she was deserving of him.<br /><br />Overall, this book is very cute and a fast paced read. It made me smile, and it would be wonderful if first love could be like this for everyone. I know I am one of the few people who didn't give this book five stars, but it doesn't mean that I didn't like it (:
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Loved this show! It's a shame that it ended so quick. I can't wait to watch season 2. I would prefer that it was on Prime. Maybe if I wait a while.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story was really beautifully written. With that said, it kind of feels like it was written to inspire its readers to kill themselves. It was like watching every season finale of Grey's Anatomy, reading the death scenes of Dumbledore and Hedwig and Fred and Lupin and Tonks and Colin Creevy, then getting kicked in the stomach.<br />But, you know, in a good way.

B005544TRQ|5.0|I zipped through both seasons so fast.  Love the characters and the play between the different personalities.  I can't wait for the new season on Prime.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lots of fun. This game is very addictive. My 7 year old loves to play the easier levels. Haven't made it to the harder levels yet.
B008Y7G1BI|5.0|this movie has it all. First of all action, a great story, great characters with back stories, visually stunning, fun soundtrack, and some comedy.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Not what I expected but we found it quite a twist to a old tale. The Ginger Bread and Candy were a cute touch,
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great story, read it in two days! Perfect for the beach or a long flight! Hope the movie is as good and doesn't butcher the story, as most do.
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|Not what I quite expected from Richard Castle. However I did find this work some work to read. Although some of the story line did wind an intriguing pathway to the conclusion.
B0037NVM1I|1.0|Since I first saw this movie, I've only watched the original version which I love. When I saw Terminator 2 on Prime Movies I decided to watch it because there was nothing on TV. Each of the new scenes and all of the differences between this movie and the original were absolutely terrible and completely ruined the classic. I will never watch this version again.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I loved The Kite Runner.  This book started off beautifully with a story about love and loss, interesting and likeable characters leaving me curious and I was excited for the same Hosseini style.  Somewhere in the middle the veered off into a different direction and lost my interest when it started focusing on different characters.  I skipped large portions of the text because I had grown attached to the characters from the beginning of the story.  I can't recommend this book, I felt like I wasted my time reading it.
B009HXG9UQ|2.0|But this movie just felt awkward and seemed to drag on when compared to films such as The Life Aquatic and the Royal Tenenbaums
B009MJUCM6|5.0|Great model and paint job on this.  Colors are done well and accurate.  Schleich does a great job on most of their animals.
0385528752|5.0|Unlike most business books, this one I enjoyed reading.  Not exactly the same feeling you get when you don't want to put down a good novel... but there were times I didn't want to put it down.  What I enjoyed was the casual, relaxed tone and the content.  I learned a lot, it made me think  I also loved the injected humor here and there.
1569242739|5.0|With a daughter with allergies to eggs it's always been hard to go to birthday parties knowing she couldn't eat the cake. Now we bring our own treat and many kids end up eating them too. The frosting is delicious!!

B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|I enjoyed this and the costumes were wonderful.The story line was good and had some unexpected twist.I would like to see more from this era.
B003E8GQ76|5.0|A great example how you can have an excellent movie with top actors and not have to spend a blockbuster budget to make it. The story has a great story and great acting,and was done with a minimal budge compared to most Hollywood movies today.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Great puzzle game. Was locked in from the moment I downloaded it. Too the point but challenging. Deducted one star only because I finished the whole game today while it was FAOD. Lots of focused fun!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's a cool game I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzles<br />And would defiantly get the next game
B000002GVO|1.0|I bought the album when it came out in the 70s, and remained one of my favorite Eagles albums. But here we are in 2013, and I thought, hey, time for a digital version. So, I ordered it through Amazon. To my dismay, when I ripped the CD into Apple's iTunes on my Mac, and listened to it via iPod, I discovered that this particular &#34;pressing,&#34; if you can call it that for a CD, is of bad quality. The entire playback of Hotel California is marred by drop outs and garbage, rendering it unplayable on the computer in iTunes, and also in any CD player in our home or car. Of course, by the time we realize that its a bad pressing and decide to notify Amazon, we are past the 30 day window for return / exchange. I really dislike getting burned by merchants who are happy to sell you inferior merchandise at market prices. Shame on you, Amazon!
B00BB8OHMW|5.0|It was a fascinating idea of Shakespeare's inspiration for Romeo and Juliet primarily. It was a likeable movie that my husband and I both enjoyed.<br />Parental review: We are very conscious and had to skip a few sex scenes. Language was pretty clean though. Overall, a very easy movie to filter manually.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A PAGE TURNER.AND A LOOK INTO HUMAN NATURE, IS THAT NATURE OR NURTURE?...THE QUESTION OF HEREDITARY IE;GENETIC MAKEUP IS INTRIGUING.I READ THIS BOOK FOR MY BOOK CLUB, WHICH MEETING IS COMING UP SOON...<br />I THINK HUMAN NATURE IS SOMEWHAT OF SEEING WHAT YOUR PARENTS REACT TO AND HOW, AND SECONDLY WHAT YOUR ENVIRONMENT IS...BUT...I DO BELIEVE YOUR MORALITY, JUDGEMENT AND ATTITUDES ARE LEARNED AT HOME.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|My husband and I have been married for almost a year. We watched it together and it was a sweet, wonderful and clean way to spend time together.<br /><br />It tells the story of a couple who marry and live a life together, eventually parting when the wife dies as an elderly lady. It is sad up through this part, then the story launches into life without your first love and creating a new adventure.<br /><br />It was fantastic. Down-to-Earth (well, except when he is above earth, flying... It is called Up), and portrays life as we can relate.<br /><br />Great Movie!
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|I got a few chapters into this and then as I found that his bad mouth was getting to me. There just isn't any need for that type of language in a book of this kind or any kind for that matter. If an author is trying to make a point and really intends to try to help others, then keep it clean and stay away from gutter words. I was not impressed with his writing and put it away for good. Bought it for my husband but told him not to bother. It is a self-help for book publishing. We are not wanting to self publish a book and that is what this one is about. It gives tips on how to publish your own book. I do not recommend it to anyone except for that reason. The title is a bit misleading. Buyer beware.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game!  can't believe it was free. provide hours of fun..recommend this for anyone.  pop up ads are a little annoying but cannot beat free
B0088W7VNG|5.0|The last season of Stargate Atlantis was great.  Wasn't crazy about Mr. Wosley but still loved the show.  Sad to see it end and sure will miss it.  Good ending!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Cannot put these books down!  George you are a master at character development... every time you kill off a beloved character you almost immediately fill the void with an newly endeared character.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Even my wife uses Kindle reader exclusively, on her iPad.  This is the best ereader I've been able to find.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I am just about finished with book 3 and can hardly wait to start book 4.  This series is so wonderful.  I can't put them down and can't say enough good things about them!
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I was pretty dead-set against this remake when I first heard about it; I mean what were Campbell and Raimi thinking? Selling their splatter-riffic legacy of Ash versus the deadites?<br /><br />But, I heard from someone I trust that it was worth seeing. And I was actually pretty impressed.<br /><br />The 2013 Evil Dead goes through many of the same motions the original and its sequel do- we have a familiar cabin in the boonies, the Book of the Dead returns (it is, after all, the plot's catalyst for the whole series), and some of the characters echo those of the original. The fact is, we could go on for a while about the similarities and callbacks to the original Evil Dead trilogy. But how does it stand on its own?<br /><br />Well, the original Evil Dead was billed as \\"The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror\\". And grueling is perhaps the best word to describe this film. The first few minutes of the film, after the initial teaser we're introduced to the five people who will be put through the wringer in the next hour and a half. This sows some seeds of character relationships, and of some mild family drama between the leads David and Mia. From here we see some building atmosphere. And then...all hell breaks loose. There's a point in the film where the audience will pretty much know the overwhelming horror is on its way, but it's done in such a way that most audience members will be profoundly uncomfortable. And that's the thing- it's making even a longtime horror fan like me uncomfortable. Some of the things that transpire are an ordeal to watch.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to the Evil Dead fan on the fence. If nothing else, rent it and see if you dig what they're selling.
0316247545|5.0|This book contains not only information about the show, but also a bit sketch, which helps to draw. It background is convenient to photograph various figures.
B000S559VW|5.0|Pixies Rock.  Need I say more?  Boston's best band on the entire planet.  Would burn things for them.  Of course kill for them.
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|The size is really big. And it very strong. So, it expanded my collection.<br />Slanting eyes, as in the original series.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a kid and still watch it every summer.  It is a great movie to watch with the kids on a rainy afternoon!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|This app was good in the beginning worked awesome. Then it just kept stopping in the middle of the video and load. And it would do it again and again. I dint know why. Now it wont work at all. PLZ FIX IT.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great show.  Each characters story pulls you in and you just can't break away! I love Maggie Smith's character!
B004XIZN5M|2.0|A bit boring.. one could read the bulk of it in approximately 10 min and find every useful hint you would get by paying more attention.<br />I'm still reading it, but it's difficult, even if my goal still is to find a way to train during summer vacation, when the gym is closed
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I love action films, and this was a good one!  You are not going to watch this film for Oscar worthy writing or acting - just a lot of cool, logic defying action that will make you think...cool did you see that guys head explode!!!!  I was really cool to see Van Damme again!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very interesting to read the differences between the book and the movie. So much more detail in the book. Only about 5% of the book is what you see in the movie. A worthwhile read.
140006922X|5.0|Well researched piece on Jesus. Definitely connects with the reader. There are some argumentative points that have been written over and over again by the previous scholars.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|David Tennant’s third run as the Doctor is as brilliant as ever.  This season he is paired with Donna Noble who you might remember as the super annoying bride in the previous year’s Christmas special but rest assured that her character is much more likeable this time around.  Her presence also introduces a new dynamic between the Doctor and his companion – rather than a love story that we saw between he and Rose or the unrequited love between he and Martha, Donna Noble is just there for the ride and they act like best mates throughout the entire season, which is refreshing.  There are subtle references to the season’s underlying plot right from the start with the appearance of Rose Tyler that continue throughout the season until the epic 3 part conclusion that brings back Rose, Jackie, Mickey, Martha, Sara, and Captain Jack.  The season is full of great episodes but “The Fires of Pompeii”, “Planet of the Ood”, “Silence in the Library”, “Forest of the Dead”, “Midnight”, and “Turn Left”, are worth a mention.  Many Whovians say that this is the best season and it is hard to disagree.
B000F9RB8K|5.0|While many women oooh and aaah over Brad Pitt, (me included) Anthony Hopkins has outdone himself on this one!  Every cast member was outstanding, and this is my favorite movie of all time.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|Great game to pass time. Can't wait for more levels and these games to come. I have the first game and now the second one.
0321714113|5.0|This is the best book. Revise the book 3 times and you will be master in C++. I loved this book more than &#34;C++ Primer Plus&#34;
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|needs more allied and axis guns. add more guns. great game to know historical weapons. great game to play for people who like guns that don't have any guns.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I have loved Phillip Phillips from the moment I saw him on American Idol last year.  This CD does not disappoint one bit!!!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The movie was entertaining right from the beginning.  I loved it.  I'm a 55 year old mom and I watched it with a bunch of teens.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This might be the best show on non-premium television.  It can be lighthearted while maintaining its serious side.  The characters are all clever in their own ways and have great interactions.
B008XG1X18|2.0|docking station was on time the tools to install the docking station still has not arrived.the tools is main reason i went with pinterest.
B00A285OOW|2.0|Very disappointed in this book. I was so excited for this to be released that I pre-ordered and read it immediately.  I was thoroughly disappointed last night when with 85% 'remained' in the book, the story ended. Even the ending was disappointing, I was expecting more, and the character of Elizabeth of York never really captured me like all the previous female protagonists.  I am most disappointed in the fact that 15% of the book was about a TV show and other pointless things I did not know I was purchasing.  It's only worth reading if it's a free version in my eyes
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman did it again.  I read through this one in two days.  I felt like I was forgetting to breathe as I fell into the story.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Its a slow read.  Very tiresome. Maybe its the style that is written in, but as much as I love a good story, this just takes way too long to get where its going.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love to play Uno! As a kid I grew up playing Uno and I play everyday.on my Kindle Fire!
B0089LOG02|5.0|It's amazing this works eventually for the main characters. The agency steps in and places and then the personal dynamics start. Can anyone imagine this working out now? Not I. I loved the book!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This book:<br />Gives an interesting story about a boy named Greg that has a crazy summer<br />Some kids can relate to also having a crazy summer
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I purchased this CD to complete my A7F collection. As it turned out I like this album as much as any of the other CD's.
B00CMQX84A|4.0|I have to admit I don't see much in the teen genre area so I was curious to see what today's teens are like in Disney's Teen Beach Movie.<br /><br />I was really impressed with both the acting and singing skills of Lynch and Mitchell. Both were adorable, enthusiastic and completely convincing in their respective roles. An adorable couple, they may be forced apart when McKenzie is set to move away.<br /><br />I'm not usually a fan of musicals but when done right (as in moderation), it can be fun! The upbeat, catchy tunes of Teen Teach Movie brought my kids in the room and at only three and five, this movie was definitely not for them. But the music was fun enough that it was enjoyable for all ages.<br /><br />In all honesty, I didn't expect to get caught up in a teen movie but I did! I was anxious to see how it turned out and if Brady and McKenzie would find a way to stay together. Anything with Disney's name on it automatically has high standards for me and this is exactly what I'd expect from a Disney<br />teen movie.<br /><br />Teen Beach Movie is a fun summer flick with love, action, comedy and music! And most importantly; it's clean wholesome entertainment for your teen!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|My wife rented this on Prime and was very entertained by the show. Streaming was flawless with no dripouts and very little pixilation.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is game a great way to see the minions do off the silver screen even though it has a couple bugs its a pretty good game that keeps you occupied
B005PK57IK|4.0|This show was worth a few laughs and certainly entertaining for a few hours. Video streaming quality was excellent as always.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Very cute movie. It has a very good ending to the story which parents will like. My son loves the minions!
B009N4QJ54|5.0|My son had not seen this Coen brothers classic so I was happy to see it was on Prime and we watched for a very enjoyable movie night.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love the game just got it but I just love it<br />already got on leaderboard to just love it.make more
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Lizzy Hale is the best performer on the Hard Rock scene today IMO with a solid performance from start to finish. I had to buy the first album after I fell in love with the second album.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|Scary? Yes. This is a very original and wonderfully shot horror film. The only thing that kept it from being a 5 star film was the ending. What's annoying about that complaint is I believed they ended it right. The ending just didn't pack the \\"shock and awe\\" that most of the movie had throughout. Overall, i would recommend it to those looking for a good and intelligent scare.
B008MM9630|5.0|This is a fun game, but on the kindle it refuses to acknowledge that it is online and that can be annoying in quests.
B0055S348W|3.0|I downloaded this because it was supposed to allow me to print from my Kindle - an ability that previously did not exist. It's a crap shoot. I managed to print a pic from my Kindle but never able to print anything else and you are supposed to be able to.  It's okay but, as usual, it is not the &#34;second coming&#34; it is made out to be.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|A worthwhile addition to get the features of the full version especially when it was offered for free for a while
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I purchased this for my wife, but I have not watched it.  She says, &#34;I'm loving it!&#34;  She is a discriminating viewer, so I'm sure it is very good.
B0091QS88K|5.0|Adorable. Easy. u need the full version but I dunt hav da ful version. Cook pasta, refreshments, and soup. It's adorable but they have some probs.<br />1. I am not paying for the full version.<br />2. u only cook 3 meals, foods, and other stuff.<br />3. 2 much customers come.<br />4. u only wash 3 dishes and the recycling is locked.<br />Although it has probs, it's still adorable.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The characters are developed well so the viewer gets to know them and how they will react.  The cast members do a fine job of presenting their characters.  It is never boring because the episodes differ enough that they don't become formula and predictable.
B00867HDTA|5.0|Worth the money! Keeps teaching you to try and bend the ball better then you think you can. Great Fun !!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|...and was surprised by how much I like this show.<br /><br />Great acting, a host of interesting characters and a compelling plot line make this one of my favorite dramas.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|I'm hoping that they keep adding more challenging levels. The more back spin or head spin that you can put on the ball. The greater the points become.
B005GG0MIS|3.0|It was okay but didn't hold my interest and must admit I didn't finish it.  It was pretty much what I thought it would be.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I loved Angry Birds. Until I updated it. It erased all of my data- stars, scores, etc. It felt like I just downloaded it for the first time. Rovio has to find a way to save people's data before it goes to far. And people, if you don't like playing the same levels you just played yesterday (even if you get all 3 stars), I recommend for you not to play this game.
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|The author took great care in her word usage. That shadowy effort gave an added cloak of a dark haunting throughout. The referencing of great works of literature gave the impression she wanted to conger the atmosphere of that book just by its mere mention. Although that would be a good literary trick, it requires that the reader have some knowledge about the work she is referencing. Without that knowledge, the reference falls flat and doesn't do the work it was intended to do. I did like the ending, and it did put me in mind of one of the works she referenced. Did she use it as an outline?
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|Have only had time to watch 5 episodes so far; so far so good. If you are a Stargate fan give it a look.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It was full of action and funny.  This movie exceeds the expectation of your curiosity and captivates your imagination.  My son loves this movie.
140006922X|5.0|Thanks to all you one-star reviewers who have not read the book.  You make me even more happy that I ordered this book.  Keep it up.  You are selling this book!<br /><br />Great interview with the author on Fox.  Asking an author why he, an expert on religions, why he would write a book about Jesus shows how little Fox thinks of their audience.  They must think they are all dumb as a box of rocks.  Surely Fox viewers can understand that a male obstetrician can be an expert on child birth even though he is never going to give birth?  The same is true for scholars.  They can be experts on a religious subject they spend years studying without being the member of some particular religion.<br /><br />The great part of the interview was the author.  Such a patient and polite man to continue to answer the same ridiculous question over and over.  He still found a way to tell the audience a little about his book.<br /><br />The book sounds very interesting and I cannot wait to read it.  My copy should arrive on Wednesday.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I was finishing out my collection.  It was nice to be able to buy new and get a great price.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Thrilling! Exciting! Engaging! The author keeps your interest, attention and anticipation through every chapter in this book. The only disappointment is that the book ends too soon. You will be wanting more, even though you already know the main plot and ultimate conclusion. This book deserves its place among the icons of war correspondence like: \\"We Were Soldiers Once... and Young\\" and \\"Blackhawk Down\\".
B003L77GG0|5.0|I was finishing out my collection.  It was nice to be able to buy new and get a great price.
B00AKKGX4W|2.0|I don't care if I sound like an immature high schooler, the love scenes in this book were hilarious, and I was cracking up the whole time I tried to read through them. Other than that, it was pretty boring. The hero did not appeal to me at all, and the heroine became extremely annoying. Too angsty and whiney for me.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I found the movie quite a bit different from what I usually view.  My age must have something to do with it.  Overall the movie was<br />interesting and moved along without the usual glitches that sometimes occur leaving you to wonder where you were or had you<br />missed a portion of the movie.<br />All in all, I enjoyed it.
1452126577|5.0|I am sure this book will put a smile on anyone's face!  It's Grumpy Cat for goodness sakes - we all know and love that cat!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Such an unbelievably boring, horrible book. The protagonist supposedly is graduating from college, but appears to have lived her entire life under a rock. By a quarter of the way in, I began to pray that Grey was going to use a board to spank her and accidentally miss and bash in her head.  So filled with remorse, he duct tapes his head and runs blindly into the luxurious shower, accidentally ripping his 78\\" television from the wall and electrocutes himself, causing a power outage in all over town, putting everyone involved, including me, out of their misery.
140006922X|4.0|First, let me start by saying that I am a believer in Christianity.  I make that known because I have read many of the reviews from \\"Christians\\" that I find to be ignorant as well as uninformed.  By \\"uninformed\\", I mean I find it hard to believe some of the reviewers read the book. Nonetheless, I think this book does an excellent job of looking at the life of the man.  The author doesn't try to devalue the Christian belief, rather he leaves the faith based portion of the story to be filled in by the reader.<br /><br />On to the review:<br /><br />I started this book with an open mind as I wanted to learn about the historical Jesus, and not read some affirmation of my faith.  I got just what I wanted.  For most of my life, the only things I knew about Jesus were only details that related to Jesus Christ, not Jesus of Nazareth.  I found this book to be a very interesting look at the man that changed the course of human history.<br /><br />I am not a self described \\"scholar\\", and I spend my time reading more often than not as entertainment rather than learning.  The lack of footnotes didn't affect me at all, and I highly recommend reading the end-notes.  I deducted one star because there were times I struggled to follow the author.  I couldn't determine how certain (small) portions of the book related to the content I was currently reading.  Of course, that could (and probably is) a personal issue...
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Just an OK read - but essentially not a story that the author was emotionally connected to as in the Frank Bascombe novels.  This work was disappointing by comparison,  Perhaps it was an experiment that did not go well?
B007ZCOT6C|5.0|I loved this book. It's one of the best I've ever read. Totally recommended for teenagers/ young adults that like novels that aren't lame.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I liked the way this all came together.  It is interesting the way that lawyers think and do their cases and that some have no regard for the people.  Only the money.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|It's great! It's just like the one my favorite logic game creator made! It's so much fun,that at this rate, I might finish it the same day I bought it!!
B000QCS8TW|3.0|This is a great story, however the author spends entirely too much time on the lineage of the minor characters.  He uses so many extra characters that it becomes a distraction.  The story directly related to the main characters is excellent unfortunately the author throws in so much additional materiel that its difficult to follow the main story line.
B000002VSN|5.0|I am true traditional gospel and Whitney Houston fan and this album is by far one of the best gospel albums ever if you even google the topic the album in the top 20 of many if not all the list whitney should have stuck with gospel. I Recommend this to anyone gospel lovers or not!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Excellent book. I didn't know anything about Mr. Aslan until I heard his interview on Fresh Air. He was very smart and engaging, and I bought the book the next day.<br />Zealot provides a unique perspective and heavily researched account of one of the most influential figures in our collective history. It is very well written, and I read it feverishly, unable to put it down. My only regret is that it ended.<br />Check it out. You won't be disappointed.
B00BEIYM42|4.0|\\"Unfinished Song\\" (alternate title \\"Song for Marion\\") revolves around a grumpy 72-year-old pensioner Arthur Harris (Terence Stamp), whose outgoing wife Marion (Vanessa Redgrave) is a member of a senior citizen choir OAPZ led by a music teacher Elizabeth (Gemma Arterton). They have a son James (Christopher Eccleston), but his relationship with his father is a little strained.<br /><br />Elizabeth's ragtag choir enters a local competition, where Marion will sing a solo, but it is discovered that her cancer has returned after a remission.<br /><br />Written and directed by Paul Andrew Williams (\\"London to Brighton\\"), \\"Unfinished Song\\" benefits from the impressive performances of the leads that almost make up for the predictable storyline and a rather flat supporting cast.<br /><br />Like a Massachusetts chorus in a wonderful documentary \\"Young at Heart\\" (it's a must), the OAPZ's repertoire includes a variety of types of music from \\"Nowhere to Run\\" (Martha and the Vandellas) to \\"Ace of Spades\\" (Motörhead) and \\"Let's Talk about Sex\\" (Salt-N-Pepa).<br /><br />Perhaps the film could have made more use of the music scenes, though I know this is basically a story about Arthur, who would choose to wait outside the building where his wife is practicing. A bit too sentimental as it is, \\"Unfinished Song\\" is worth watching for the fine performances from the veteran actors.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I tried to replace my older edition and now I can't get in to play at all.  Just refuses to accept my password and when I try to use the &#34;contact Amazon&#34; it doesn't work.  And I can't even get into the program to try to contact help there so I'm stuck.  And .... I've been playing this game for over a year.  Now I lost all my contacts that I play with also.<br />So I could curse right now but amazon won't let me!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Good game. If you don't like ads, purchase it rather than download the free version. Good application and will give you hours of satisfying entertainment.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this is a great app! I love the graphics and the futuristic quality!! its worth the 6.99 . buy this app!!!!!!!!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|First, I strongly urge you NOT to read this until you've read Ender's Game and Ender in Exile.  The story won't make as much sense if you start with the third book of a quintet.<br />But,more than a story, the Ender books are a profound meditation on what it means to be human,and how we decide what makes another creature \\"one of us\\" versus \\"one of them.\\"<br />I know that the author is currently under fire for his views on same-sex marriage, and I find it hard to understand how someone with the compassion he espouses in his books to be exclusionary in his own views.<br />The Ended books are beautiful and profound, as well as exciting and compulsively readable.  Perhaps that should be enough, at least for now.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|l like being able to connect to facebook on iphone, not always near my computer all the time.  Thank you
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|Oblivion is a visually appealing flick with a strong bias toward lifting elements from sci-fi that did it better, and thankfully those movies didn't try to cram the whole kitchen sink into two hours. The action sequences were mostly good, though sometimes hokey (\\"I'm a droid with frickin' lasers, so naturally I'm going to come alongside your craft and ram you!\\" <-- seems legit). In the end, Oblivion left as many questions open as it answered and it sailed too close to the sun. I pray the open loops are not entry points for a sequel, it wasn't polished enough for folks to get excited about the prospect.<br /><br />Then again, Hollywood's not known for its good sense. (See: Grown Ups 2, Extra Excrement Edition)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game.I love that you can get like every kind of horse you could ever want.it is appropriate for all ages.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|I'm enjoying this new version of Quell, after finishing all the levels of the earlier two versions. I like the new twists, including gems, ice, color changing tiles, and the need to &quot;switch&quot; things &quot;on&quot; and<br />&quot;off.&quot; Fun new sequencing, logic, and constrained problem-solving challenges.  If you liked the other Quells, you'll like this. If you haven't tried Quell yet, you should!
B008S7EPXA|5.0|Solid set of tracks. Familiar enough sound with a fresh delivery. Thoughtful lyrics from Brendan with his distinctive smooth delivery. Lisa’s voice is as clear, beautiful and soaring as ever.
B001B1T7BU|4.0|It is a cute movie & Glenn Close does a good job. Not sure if I would watch it again though.
B005HEDI3K|4.0|I mean, it's Captain Kirk and Mr Spock. Cheesy... Fabulous... Dramatic... Everything we love about the original Star Trek. The plots primarily gravitate towards, \\"This earth-like planet has this problem--how would/did we solve a problem like that, historically?\\" Or, \\"Powerful being wants universal power--let's outsmart him.\\" And there's frequently a side dish of \\"Oh handsome Captain Kirk... How ever shall I resist you!\\" Great stuff.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a great story!..Love the history and the characters!<br />Once you start watching this....it's like reading a great novel!...can't stop!
B00004RF83|5.0|Terrific movie, good character acting by ALL.  Full screen, so people don't look like ants, and I LOVE full screen movies!  Sound a tiny bit low, but all in all, 5 stars for actors and production.  This was a used copy and it is as good as if brand new.  Truly.  Recommended to all.<br />Cecy
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found this game to be fun and challenging.  It kept me interested and was a  bit addictive too.  I highly recommend it.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Is fun for adults teens and small children....its good fun for everyone especially if you need to pass time while your waiting for so.ething or someone, this is the game to play
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched this show when it aired and decided that I'd like to rewatch the seasons. I streamed season 1 and 2 through another service on the wii to the tv, but amazon instant video was the only one that had season 3. The picture quality was great and it was easy to navigate through the wii.<br /><br />The show itself is fantastic. Season 3 was filled with scandal, fun, weddings, heartbreak, and sadness. Lots of emotions throughout the whole season!
B000002VFW|5.0|SULTRY, JAZZY, AND SMOOTH.  SHE DID NOT DISAPOINT. HER VOICE JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER. AND THE SELECTIONS ARE FANTASTIC. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Take it mind off it worries play jewels star!<br /><br />Fun fun !  passes the time in a fun way! Get it now!
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|I have a love-hate thing going on with Neil Gaiman's books at the moment. Sometimes he writes compelling, powerful stories, and other times he descends (IMHO) into poorly-paced whimsy. This book straddles both, and therefore was a mixed experience for me. I Liked the main idea, and the characters, but I felt that the overall concept needed a little extra push. I kept waiting for a final revelation that never came, but that doesn't mean it was a bad read. Definitely worth a look.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game offers cute little games. Some are easy. Some are harder. All are enjoyable. I like it!!!!_<br />Very relaxing!!!!!
B0037TPMOA|5.0|I must have read this book five times over the years. It's just a masterclass in suspense and world-building. Anyone who has seen the Kubrick film is in for a shock, because the book is very different. Actually, there's a TV movie version that is much more faithful to the book. Not saying one is better than the other, but they're  very different.<br /><br />Er... back onto the book! What really works here is the creation of the hotel as a stage for this extraordinary psycho-drama. The characters and their histories twist and weave through the narrative, and by the end of the book you're left feeling kind of breathless. On top of that, there are some very creepy moments that gain much of their power from the fact that they're so closely linked to the charactes. Just a big Wow! of a book, really.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I am now able to use my cloud player on my cell phone  the way it was intended to be used and can get my music super quick now that I have the MP3 app
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good way to pass time waiting at appointments and also at lunch time. Interesting but not so hard that you stress over it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Witty, smart, and entertaining. Couldn't ask for more in a show. Warning - you will become addicted if you aren't already.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Excellent series.  All of the cast are superb in this series, but Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright stand out and are award-worthy!  No one could play this part as well as Kevin Spacey does and Clare Underwood (Robin Wright) is a complicated woman with class from the top of her head to the tip of her toes!!  I highly recommend House of Cards.  I cannot wait until the 2nd season.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is a cute little puzzle game.  It is fairly light and simple, good for kids, or for a quick simple puzzler to play for killing time.  I haven't found any bugs or glitches yet.  I hope they make more levels.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Both Expendables are wonderful movies with the cadre of great actors. There is personal touches, villains to hate, funny moments, and portrayals of solid relationships and acceptance.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Because ir was everything it claimed it would be.  It's great to deal with folks that let the deed match the words.
B004L03B3S|5.0|The taboo, and more so in the Country that it was staged a great love story that for many would be unaccepted and. There is another similar short movie like this one but this one really captures the attention on the subject, artistic.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I haven't finished this reading yet, but so far have been mesmerized. Lots of research to back up an incredible description of that time. Based on my reading thus far, I certainly recommend this reading for a different description of Jesus.
0743497465|5.0|I picked up Dan Brown's \\"Inferno\\" after a good friend of mine recommended it. I wasn't a huge fan of \\"The Lost Symbol\\" because I thought it was too much like the Disney film \\"National Treasure.\\" Having said all that, I really enjoyed \\"Inferno\\" and another friend suggested I go way back to \\"Deception Point.\\" And I did! I can't rip through the pages of this book fast enough. It is the perfect summer, popcorn read. I don't care about a fact checker when I read a book like this. I just ask myself \\"Are you having fun?\\" and I am. I'd really like to see Dan Brown move away from the Robert Landgon stories for awhile and delve into some like \\"Deception Point\\" again.
030758836X|3.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and I read it fairly quickly. I definitely enjoyed Nicks chapters more than Amy's. The problem I have with this book is that once I was done reading it I was over it. I didn't feel the usual sadness and withdrawals that you feel when you finish a great book. It was interesting but could have easily been a short story. I am looking forward to David Fincher's directing of the film as he is one of my favorite directors and I think he will do a great job adding suspense to this mediocre story.
B0025CS2GU|5.0|What can I say...Just watch it and have a laugh.  From the beginning credits to the end, you will be laughing your head off!!!
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is the perfect fall time, Halloween time series.  It's about a family of three that move into a house with a darkened past.  It's great how they integrated all the past stuff to the future.  Great show!
0440245915|3.0|I was excited to pick up this book because I had enjoyed the movie so much.  Now I see the effort that went into Matthew McConaughey's performance... while I have never considered him a talented actor, it was quite a feat to make Jake Brigance into a sympathetic character.  In the book, he is extremely unlikeable... selfish, childish and prideful.  He is far more concerned with the tv cameras than with the safety of his own family, or even the client himself.<br /><br />While I found the plot itself to be interesting, it was not enough to balance out the obnoxious protagonist.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Maybe I'm missing something, but I found this game terribly confusing! It didn't &#34;play&#34; the way the actual game with cards goes. I guess I'm old fashioned...I'll stick to the card game.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Friends had reccommended this English series about Life in<br />England before, during and after WWI.<br />The acting is incredible and gives you a lot of insight into how<br />The English lived during a very elegant period and the changes that<br />took place before and after the war.<br />Superb!<br /><br />Magic
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|A sweet and interesting story in a beautiful setting, with lots of good music. I would have enjoyed it more if the other  main characters had been developed as well as the character played by Maggie Smith. However, it is still a good movie and worth enjoying.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this man's story. His love of soldiering comes through very strongly. I had trouble putting the book down because I wanted to know what was going to happen next!<br /><br />Yeah I'm female and this so isn't a girly book. But I really tend to geek out on military and baseball books, just love them! Part of it is that I love men and the way they are that is just &#34;guy&#34;. Love 'em! And this book is so &#34;guy&#34; with some of the best man qualities and some of the most human personal difficulties.<br /><br />I'm not someone to get all happy about killing, but this is a war situation and to me that's different from just murdering people. If I had to protect my family, friends and country you better believe I wouldn't be shrinking away from it. So I don't have a problem with the author's career despite being a middle aged liberal lady who prefers not to shoot people (although I never turn down a little target shooting!)<br /><br />I am happy we have people who like to fight because I really like my freedom and would prefer to KEEP it.<br /><br />And it's always great to be good at what you do!<br /><br />So thanks to Mr. Kyle for a really great read, for doing an excellent job as a SEAL and for fighting for our country! I am also glad you are doing well post-military, and wish you and your family the best.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|I know it's a bit early to call this a classic but it's a very dope album.  From beginning to end, I enjoy this album.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|we love this show.  this season is definitely different than seasons past but can still make you laugh, smile and cry.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|I use this charger to power my devices when bike riding, being that my phone is my bike computer, I never have to worry about my phone's battery level b4 riding.  GREAT PRODUCT!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|LOVED IT!!!!  far outweighed what we expected!  we don't have kids but definitely kept us entertained! Highly recommend for couples!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This story is well known for the sexual side, but it also has an amazing love story attached to it. I preferred the love story!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Having the book extras- quick summaries of stories, characters and places, was great. Good book outline was provided for easy access to the large amount of information
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Buddy Guy is the King of Chicago Blues & here is the proof. Buddy just turned 77 years old today & shows no signs of slowing down with his first 2 cd album. I grew up in Chicago & spent lot's of my free time at his place Legends & have met the man & even sat down next to him at his bar & had beers with him. Super nice man he is not to big to hang out with his fans & can play his heart out.This album is a statement that he is 77 years old & i think he just put out his best album ever. The songs are well thought out & put together. The production is tight & he is playing some of the best guitar i have ever heard him do on a studio album. Just to name a few highlights justifyin,What's up with that women.The Devils daughter & whiskey Ghost are just very cool slow blues. & thats just a few off the first disc.Some of his past studio albums just didn't capture his live guitar sound & this one does. This is exactly how he sounds live. on this set you have a few collaborations & everyone of those are awesome with  Kid Rock,Keith Urban,Beth Hart,Steven Tyler, Joe Perry & Brad Whitford,Gary Clark, Jr. The album is so good it leaves me saying How does he do it? If you have ever liked anything this man has done this is the album you should be buying & adding to your collection. I think it is his best album yet.One disc rhythm, One disc Blues & One Buddy Guy. What more could anyone ask for.
B00433TO52|4.0|This book included a lot of old reference material. It would have been nice, especially since this is Shakespeare, to include story line summaries as a &#34;Book Extra&#34;.  Other than that nicely outlined in TOC.
B00BU18U82|5.0|This is better than the computer version but it cost more for better equipment but over all it is awesome
B005COO1X6|5.0|I love Stephen Kings's writing.  I really like it when the Kindle books include Book Extra links for additional information on places, characters, etc.
B00BGICGJ8|1.0|to much four letter words to even come close to being a good movie. I'd love to get my money back on this one.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I would recommend that everyone watch this.  Well written and well played out!  Great movie. Makes you think about how you could improve yourself!
B005ETA5K2|5.0|I feel as if I could conquer the world of Wireless with this device connected to my computer.  Easy to install and use, I get great signal every time.  I can also recommend using Velcro to attach the little box to the back of your laptop's screen for easy transport and keeping it out of the way while you surf the web.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A gripping easy read. I fell in love with the characters and just couldn't put it down. Be prepared to cry uncontrollably.
B004132HZS|5.0|I absolutely love this show. I have watched it repeatedly since buying it. It is an updated version of the classic Sherlock Holmes stories. If Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was alive now he could have written this. The actors portray there characters well. Did I mention I love this show.
B00007KWHP|5.0|This review is for the 2003 remaster on WEA/Atlantic.<br />1.) Terrific packaging - not only have they replicated the original booklet but they've added complete lyrics and the inside cover of the cd has photos not in the LP.<br />2.) I have the 1994 remaster and it's good. I wondered if I threw money away buying this 2003 issue. I did not. I think it's an even more vibrant sound than the 1994 and not compressed.<br />3.) In case you didn't know, it's simply one of the great albums of all time.<br />4.) A couple bonus tracks; 'America' written by Paul Simon, which is quite good; and a rough early mix of 'Roundabout' - take it or leave it. I didn't see that much difference
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I gotta say, I love this season as much as the first. The last episode, of course, made me cry.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book! I enjoyed reading each within this trilogy. Worth every minute! Purchase all three books, it won't be disappointing.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I could not put the book down.  One of Gillian Flynn's best novels.  This is a must read for everyone!
1451668945|5.0|It's a must read and moves very quickly. As with all of the Marky Higgins Clark books, you can't WAIT to read the next one!
B008OW1SAC|5.0|Yeah this album rocks. My most played record this year by a long shot. Give it a listen! You won't be disappointed.
B000V5ZIBU|1.0|I can't watch any of the free PRIME MEMBERSHIP videos because the player says that some how, I must have broken it. As far as I am concerned, that is a fraudulent act, to sell something that a buyer can not have after paying for it. Pick a player company to go after in court.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Pretty redundant.  Is there more to it?  It seems like you must have wi-fi to full-functionally play.  Probably won't play much longer.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|I was hesitant to watch this after seeing some very bad reviews from movie critics. I am glad that I watched it. The plot was engaging, the characters were interesting, the plot twists (which I will not go into) actually made the movie more enjoyable, the effects were great, and the depiction of post apocalyptic Earth was intriguing. I wish that Morgan Freeman would have appeared earlier in the film. I wish that the last five minutes of the film (after the movie's climax) would have been changed or eliminated which is why I didn't give it a five star rating.<br /><br />If you enjoy Science Fiction films, this is a film you should definitely check out.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|I would watch it again, if that is saying anything.  It was a nice way to spend the evening.  Since I had no expectations going into it I was pleasantly surprised I enjoyed it.
B009WUBERW|4.0|I liked two better than one. It was an entertaining action flick. It had enough plot to explain why the characters were acting in the manner they were acting, and then it was pretty much all action. If you are looking for a deep, philosophical, mind stimulating, thought provoking film, this is not it. If you are looking for a testosterone fueled, explosion filled, grunting, scratching, bullets flying don't make me think to much, let my brain shut down and watch things go boom film, then this is just what you are looking for. As an added bonus, the actors are constantly poking fun at some of their most iconic roles. It is great comic relief.<br /><br />I was originally going to give it only three stars, but in retrospect, as an action film, it is fun and entertaining. Worth a watch.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Very similar to all the other Batman movies, but I love most of them as well.  Wonderful effects, well done, very entertaining.  I would definitely add it to your movie library.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|This app is a great addition to my Kindle Fire.  I can now keep my music, videos, and photos all in one place.  It works well, and I would highly recommend it for anyone who likes to be organized.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|one needs it to borrow some books from a Library.  It also charges the kindle.  Needless to say,  it's not needed to purchase.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A fitting and seamless conclusion to a work of philosophy disguised as fantasy. For those who have followed Wheel of Time from a beginning the rewards of that journey to this, an ending, have been many and memorable. A heartfelt Thank You to Mr. Jordan for the creation of this saga and to Mr. Sanderson for taking up the challenge and following the path. The magic and the One Source live.
B004289ZW0|2.0|This unit comes on all the time when it's in my pocket.  I've given up trying to figure out how to store it so that it's guaranteed to be fully charged when I need it.  I ended up going to the Bad Elf Pro.  If this unit had a simple on/off button, it would get a solid 4 star rating from me.  The size is perfect, but it's a perfect paperweight if the batteries are discharged when you need it.
B003TSEL7S|3.0|This is a good start to the series.  The story is easy to follow and an easy read. Recommend! Looking forward to book 2.
B007IQWQ88|5.0|I was fortunate as a young boy to receive the Karajan Edition as a gift from my parents to start my journey in classical music.  Most of the more popular discs of that Edition are now in this box along with many others that are worth listening to.  I popped in the Pictures from an Exhibition disc from this set and the sound is indeed much improved from the already very good standard achieved in the Edition previously. Therefore, this makes the set a very attractive acquisition, possibly better than the 1970s box when recording venues and stylistic issues occassionally crop into play.  The 1970s BPO sound is also a child of its time, steely and unrelenting, with an explosive force that conjures the inhuman - some people will love it others find it a tad superficial no matter the skill it took to produce such a sound.  In the 1960s, the sound is much warmer, true its less powerful but ironically more is said when less power is employed.  Thanks DG (and some diehards in Korea) for launching this onto the market, so that what was once forgotten can be treasured again.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am really enjoying this and can't wait to see what happens. It is rather long though. Great concept and facts are very accurate.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Well written, compelling, sweet sad story.  I didn't want it to end. As soon as I finished it I started thinking about who I could share it with.
B0062NAX1U|3.0|Movie was OK. It was delivered on time.  Item was just as described.  It was highly recomended to me but it was OK not great.
B0017VT5E8|4.0|Considering this movie is almost 40 years old ..... WOW ...... I gave it 4 stars.  Yes, it's kinda cheesy but considering it was written in 3 days and won the acadamy award, I think that speaks for itself.  Ya gotta at least like the love story aspect!
B001VFTYWI|5.0|Patricia Cornwell rocks!!  I have loved this series since I read the first book.  Now I'm going to have to order her Cooking Book.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Not the usual Bond film. Rather dark but full of action and very fast paced. Javier Bardem, as usual plays a great villain.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Such a good series. I'm a complete shut-in now because all I do is read these books. They're so long, which is great for fast readers like myself because it takes me longer to finish it. The world is SO in-depth and detailed, and full of imagination! Love this series <3

B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|Given the amount of hoopla swirling about this book, hopefully this review can at least attempt to navigate the treacherous waters of prevailing opinion.<br /><br />On some level this book is neither as good (nor as bad) as many reviewers suggest.  It's a little tricky to know exactly what to make of it in that, although it draws from historical sources as much as possible, there are places where the author must either fill in gaps in the archaeological evidence and sort of stray away from what we would consider purist history.  (That said, it must be conceded that given the author's academic background in sociology, these guesses tend to be generally accurate, although at times they left me sort of scratching my head.)<br /><br />The truth is that (much like me with this review) Aslan is also navigating dangerous currents of theology, culture, history, and contemporary geopolitics in his analysis, and given the loaded nature of the topic, at times his hypotheses seem a tad, well, overzealous, to be blunt. From my own perspective there are times and places where the work feels excessively loaded in its estimations of the subject matter discussed (both Jesus and the nature of his contemporary Judean, er, \\"Palestinian\\" environs).  That is to say that although the book generally stays relatively even handed, there are areas where the reader may (or may not) surmise some politicization of the subject matter, or rather some polarization in the treatment of the subject matter.<br /><br />With all this said, you're pretty much going to get out of \\"Life and Times\\" more or less exactly what you bring to it.  For readers who tend to share Aslan's perspectives, you're going to find it enlightening and important.  For those who disagree with Aslan (either religiously or geopolitically) it's going to be an outrage machine.<br /><br />For my part, I tried to stay relatively open-minded, but I didn't really find enough of what I was looking for (i.e. actual \\"history\\" you know: archaeology, documentation, golden-statues on weighted temple pedestals) in the text.  It's not a bad read, but it doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Rather it rehashes a lot of points that have been made before, with a lilt towards authorial editorializing. If you're looking for a sounding board for your own beliefs (in either direction) then check it out.  If you're looking to learn something new, you may want to look somewhere else.

030758836X|5.0|This book was getting so many rave reviews, so I had to read it. It took me a month to read the first quarter because it was slow and I didn't understand what all the hype was about. I kept putting it down to read other books, but kept picking it back up in hopes that a miracle would happen and that I would actually like this book. Then suddenly a quarter of the way in... I was hooked and I could not put this book down! It may have taken me a month to read the beginning, but only one evening to finish it! This book is insane, sick and wonderful!!! I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!

B00CDY6HW6|4.0|I had a very frustrating problem on the Samsung S2.  The screen was lowered by a centimeter or two, making it impossible to see the gameplay buttons.  Once I upgraded the game to the latest version, and the phone's software to the latest version, the screen issue disappeared.<br /><br />This is a fun game that my daughter loves to play.  If you've ever played Lemmings, then you know how to play.  The bunnies are cute, and the strategy is simple yet challenging.  A good, solid game, great for a wide range of ages.

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I may be a younger viewer of the classic films (age 25) but I really enjoy these films. They have very good story lines, acting, and directing as well as capturing the audience. I added this film into my collection so that I may share them with my future kids to enjoy and see what real film making used to be. True, it may take longer to develop the plot, but the plot is solid and well worth the wait. This is a classic film i believe everyone should at least see once. Lawrence of Arabia is one of my favorite classic films of all time.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|And clearly the best tv series which was canceled during the first season...<br /><br />Serenity, the movie is even better.<br /><br />Too bad they'll never make more.

140006922X|5.0|I bought this at a local B&N recently and after seeing a news interview of author I had to check to see the status of the book.  I was surprised and deeply disappointed to see so many 1 star reviews.  It's a book about the life of Jesus written from a professors historical perspective. That is all. I feel that many if not most of the one-star reviews are people \\"reading in-between the lines\\" just because the author happens to be Muslim.  Nearly all the theories discussed in this book have already been proposed and by Christian academics at that.  Sadly,this book has shown our own bias as you'll see with some one star reviews labeled; \\"Muslim knuckle headed author\\", \\"Anti-Christian book written by Muslim\\" and \\"Christian fatwa?\\"
B001BR5NN0|5.0|i have been looking for this for a while and im glad i finally found it and at a good low price
159463176X|4.0|The first 50 pages were very compelling and just as you are looking to enjoy the relationship between the 2 small children and their family they are separated for 60 years.  The book then diverges to many characters and many stories.  It winds in a wonderful but sometimes frustrating way. And you just can't love any of the other characters at all.  There is nothing wonderful about any of them. You just want those kids to get to gether again and by the time they do it is really too late.  The reunion between the two Pari's and the finding of family is wonderful and heartwarming.  I cried.  Oh Well.  I give it four stars not five becuase it was a bit broken up when all the other characters started appearing.
B002N2LEVM|5.0|Outstanding scripts, acting, shooting.  Never fails to disappoint; had to get the dvd so I could watch it over & over.  Highly recommended.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|Waste of time. Not fun, bad editing. Bad jokes. Bad acting (actors trying to look like bad actors and failing). Gratuitous violence.<br />Ugh, why waste any more time on this crap film. Fine.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I've been reading &#34;Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years&#34; by Diarmaid MacCulloch for some time now. It's one of those books you can read and re-read again and again because it's dense with information and history, though written in an English academic style that's certain readable and understandable, but takes some careful thinking ... at least for me.<br /><br />So I was glad to come across &#34;Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth&#34; because while it's *written by an academic, it's more porous in style and easier to absorb. Oh, the *history is there surely, it just isn't a densely packed style. It's more open and allows me to see the kind of man Jesus must have been because the author makes it clear what sort of people he came from, what work was done, how they lived and survived. (It wasn't easy - that part of the world seems to have been seething for a long time before Jesus was born and it continues to seethe today.)<br /><br />It's refreshing to take a look at Jesus' life without the usual religious spin, to have the gospels parsed and the calendar of their creation outlined so clearly. I recommend this book highly.

So grab your popcorn and enjoy with or without family.

B00821PCJS|5.0|One of the best Sci-Fi for television programs I've seen in a long time.  I am especially intrigued by the Christian character who still clings to her Faith in spite of the disaster around her.  I'm finding it hard to believe that anything produced by Hollywood actually portrays Christianity as a legitimate faith or belief system that is genuine.  Too many times, Christians are portrayed as some kind of oddball that cannot be taken seriously.  That type of portrayal is neither accurate or fair.  I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop in some future episode--hopefully, it will not.

B0074YVW1G|5.0|The description and references to &#34;Highly Sensitive People&#34; alone were worth the price of the book - I know a few people who fit that category and this book helped me understand them far better than I did.<br /><br />While I myself am an introvert, this book helped me understand myself better too.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend to anyone who has felt like running away from the crowds, or if you know someone who feels that way.
B00881VLCE|4.0|It was fun for my child.  There is a very limited number of puzzles.  Additional puzzles cost.  You have to pay to remove ads.  The program was easy to use.  My son started to buy another puzzle and I had to stop him.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|After years of reading and studying religion, I was intrigued by this book when I first heard of it. For two days it consumed my life. Very interesting, well-written and thought provoking. Watching the ridiculous interview on Fox was just further proof of how close-minded Christians can be. This book is NOT anti-Jesus. Just the opposite. It delivers an accounting of the historical times in which he lived and encourages the reader to further explore who and what this individual was and what message he was attempting to deliver, rather than just being spoon-fed religious \\"facts\\". Ask yourself...if a teaching or historical account is the truth, than shouldn't it be able to withstand any and all scrutiny? It is sad to see how many one-star reviewers did not actually read the book. Are they really so afraid of information that might call into question their beliefs that they must scream their opposition without ever really understand what it is that they are opposing?
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Wonderful acting and a great storyline.  This is one to sit and watch some weekend, marathom style.  Gr8 supporting cast.

B009LDD1X0|1.0|TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about. After hearing all this great stuff, I thought I should jump in! On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS. I watched about 4 episodes, didn't find them funny, so I decided it wasn't for me. Recently I won a season in my office's white elephant. I thought I would maybe give it another try, because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch. I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes' and none of the jokes &#34;come out of the charecters.&#34; I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone. I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is. If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community. and how &#34;geeky&#34; they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful. I know some of you probably disagree with me, and that's OK. This is just my opinion.
140006922X|5.0|I read Dr. Aslan's book in two days upon receiving it (and this was before the \\"Faux\\" news interview mishap) and I LOVED IT!!! The tone of the author's voice in writing this book is gentle and with great respect towards Jesus of Nazareth. His scholarly research is impeccable with over fifty pages of end notes and a bibliography and index.  Dr. Aslan clearly is fascinated with Jesus and has a genuine thirst to learn and write about all he can about this amazing man from 2,000 years ago.<br /><br />I am quite surprised by the extent of the 1-star trashing on amazon from reviewers who clearly have not read this book.  I'm also amazed that these same people seem to have forgotten Jesus' own comments on his followers' faith in the Book of Matthew: is one secure in his or her faith that it is as strong as a rock or are they as insecure in their faith as standing in sinking sand?
B002JVWQSW|3.0|The first season of Modern Family was hilarious. When I started watching season 2 though I noticed I decline in quality. Season 2 was still funny, but it was not as good as the first. Then came season three, season 3 was just awful. They were trying to be a \\"smart show\\", they kids on the show were treated like adults, and that annoys me so much! The one thing that bothers me the most is that Ed O'neil got his start as Al Bundy on Married With Children. Married with Children started the trend of family TV shows that were kind of realistic. In Married with Children Al Bundy didn't have a good relationship with his kids, his wife and he had arguments, and as a Dad today, when I watch those Married With Children marathons on TBS. I can relate to them so much! But Ed is now on a show that his original show was once spoofing. I really wouldn't recommend this if you want a show that you want to watch ALL of the episodes, because the twenty something episodes on this are the only good ones.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars is a story about the side effects of dying. In all reality, since each one of us is in our own dying state every day, everything we do is a side effect of dying.<br />This heart-warming, tear-jerking story is about a sixteen-year-old girl, Hazel Grace, who has a terminal illness. She knows, like so many other kids in her situation, that her set of days is numbered. She goes to a Support Group for kids with or who previously had cancer, and one day she meets the wonderful, beautiful, charming Augustus Waters. I won't spoil anything, but be prepared for one of the greatest stories you will ever read. Friendship, love, heartbreak, strength, and beauty are all things discovered in this piece art. This book is truly wonderful.<br />So, I encourage you, reader, to buy this book. It is so worth it, with it's beautiful story about two cancer victims with the deepest thoughts and sense of puzzlement about the world. Yes, I cried for hours after I finished reading, but perhaps it was because the characters have a way of thinking that I strive for, and also, Augustus Waters is my new dream Prince Charming. I am in love with John Green's story and I cannot wait to see what he will write for the world to ponder next.

B00CZAYNOC|4.0|2013's The Wrong Side Of Heaven And The Righteous Side Of Hell Vol. 1 is the fourth full-length studio album by the American Metal band Five Finger Death Punch; It was produced by Kevin Churko (who produced and played bass on their third album, American Capitalist) and as its name implies is one part of a two album set, with part two set to be released separately afterwards.<br /><br />Five Finger Death Punch aren't a band for elitists, they aren't a band for snobs. If you've ever insulted a band for being `posers' or `mallcore' or criticized a band for its image rather than its music then they are definitely something you should avoid.<br /><br />What they specialize in is simple, memorable and catchy Metal that is entertaining and enjoyable. They walk a fine line between being too heavy for the radio and yet too light for underground credibility. Equally some of their song titles, lyrics, stage banter and merchandise isn't always the most tasteful and artistic in the world but they know what they are doing musically. The band know how to write good songs, filled with crunchy riffs, great solos, vocal parts you can sing along with and melodies that get stuck in your head for days.<br /><br />The direction of their sound is a sort of clean, crisp and deceptively heavy mixture between Hard Rock, the less Grungey or Industrial sides of Alternative Metal and those occasional commercial radio-Metal singles by heavier bands. Imagine a mixture between Vulgar era Pantera, Vol. 3 era Slipknot and Indestructible era Disturbed and you'll get a vague ballpark idea of their sound.<br /><br />All of their albums so far have been in a similar direction, with changes happening slowly and logically between albums, so while their debut was a bit faster and a little more Metalcore influenced than their last album for example, you can always tell within a few seconds that its Five Finger Death Punch you're listening to. They are distinctive and they have a clear formula. This new album is no different. Its not an exact copy of what's came before and yet if you've heard a Five Finger Death Punch album before, then you'll know more or less what to expect from this.<br /><br />Tracks like the opener `Lift Me Up,' the speedy `Burn MF' and the ridiculously catchy `You' cover the same ground that the band have covered before, again, but remarkably well, and `Wrong Side Of Heaven' and `M.I.N.E (End This Way)' provide the softer side of the album that fans will have come to expect by now. With such a successful formula there was no real need to experiment too far away just yet, but the band did a really good job of creating fresh and different sounding material without abandoning their core sound.<br /><br />That being said, there are a few surprises though, like slightly electronic undertones on `Watch You Bleed' and the ever-so-mildly progressive `Anywhere But Here' & `Diary Of A Deadman.' Its not a million miles away from the band's usual direction, but it is a change nonetheless. Just like there are vocal patterns and riff types dotted around the record that you haven't heard the band try before. Small changes, gradually and over time.<br /><br />Similarly, while Five Finger Death Punch are not strangers to cover songs, (Faith No More, Pantera, Bad Company) this album contains something of a curveball choice, in a cover of LL Cool J's `Mama Said Knock You Out.'<br /><br />The album also contains guest appearances from other artists; with Rob Halford of Judas Priest singing on the opener `Lift Me Up,' as well as Maria Brink of In This Moment guesting on `Anywhere But Here' and hip hop artist Tech N9ne guesting on aforementioned unexpected cover song. If you get the bonus tracks you'll also find Hatebreed's Jamey Jasta singing on another version of album closer `Dot Your Eyes,' and Max Cavelera on an alternative version of `I.M Sin'.<br /><br />Overall; this is a very good record. It mightn't win over any haters, but as a Five Finger Death Punch albumit absolutely hits all the right spots, and still manages to take you on a few unexpected journeys. If you already like the band, it serves up more of what you want (bouncy, infectious songs in the band's usual style, with choruses you'll probably sing all summer, solos that will put a smile on your face, and an ear pleasing production) and it serves it all up to a very high standard.it absolutely hits all the right spots, and still manages to take you on a few unexpected journeys.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I was fortunate enough to attend Pink Floyd during this tour and must say it was the best concert I've ever seen. At the end of the concert when Gilmour is playing the extended solo at the end of Comfortably Numb and the huge disco ball rises up and cascades the audience with lights is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. You can relive this experience on these DVD's or experience it for the first time if you missed it. The DVD's are high quality footage of a great, long, Pink Floyd concert that you can put in anytime you want to escape to the Dark Side of the Moon. There are a few extra features that are worthwhile on these discs also, quite a bargain for the price, highly recommended.

It was almost like she was trying to just get by and be done with it. I didn't feel the love in the last couple of books, but I just knew it would get better. Now I feel in the end she hated everything about her own series and just went through the motions to fulfill a contract. I had hoped for better for these characters.<br /><br />This is coming from a woman who used to read Laurell K. Hamilton and saw the disaster that series became. I honestly thought no author in the genre could top that train wreck. I stand corrected. I know full well that the authors own their work, they know what is best for them as writers, and they can, and should, do as they please. I can do as I please, too. I stopped reading Hamilton, and Harris goes on the no-read list, as well. It won't hurt them in the end, (I'm just one person) but it will make me feel better.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Every woman needs to read this book to start powerful conversations about what you want for yourself and your family.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Clear instructions<br />Logical, easy to use interface<br />Multiple levels of difficulty<br />No scratch paper or guessing necessary<br />Definitely recommend to fans of logic games, especially Sudoku
0307477479|1.0|The characters were predictable, simplistic. Nothing special unless you want a soap-opera type plot. The writing is very first-draft and depthless. I read this after reading some quality literature (Graham Greene,  F. Scott Fitzgerald) so I didn't expect it to live up to these standards, but it soon became clear that Goon Squad was craft-less compared to authors who put in some real blood, sweat, and tears.
B007JMW46U|5.0|Like the suspense.  His character development is great. The descriptions of locations and conditions of the times is excellent and believable<br />4star review
B0052UZIFA|5.0|plants vs. zombies is awesomeness! the first time I played it was on my computer now I played for the second time on my kindle. I cant wait for a new plants vs zombies to come out.
B005K17RU0|2.0|App didn't seem up to the minute.  It had too much of a looking at a tv and had too much information crammed into a small tablet format. I went back to weather bug.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I believe all his books are great.  Always looking forward to the next one.  Six more words are now provided.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I dont know why i keep playing this game.  For some reason i keep putting myself throught the redundant nature of this game thinking that it will result in something cool.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I grew up watching Star Trek The Next Generation in the 90s, you know with Whoopie Goldberg, and the guy from Reading Rainbow. That was definitly my favorite among them all.. until I started watching the 60s episodes. Shatner is sooo young! and I supposed he was considered Hot back then. It cracks me up how they have the closeups of his face - not moving - for drama and effect. Great episodes, special effects are horrible and laughable, but that's ok, it was nearly 50 years ago!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|not sure where I went wrong, but  I will type in a search item and then cannot find a &#34;search&#34; button, took it off my Kindle Fire
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The production values are off the chart. Within five minutes of watching you'll be transported back in time to the 9th century. The stories are engaging and layered. You'll care about the characters and learn about the lives of Vikings by the point of view of a Christian monk. The actors do a wonderful job of inhabiting their roles. I watched the whole season on my Kindle during down time at the beach it was fabulous!!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I have my old 85W adapter from my earlier gen macbook pro.  This works perfectly with my new retina macbook pro and it even has the magnet built in.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Wasn't sure if we would like this show...was addicted after the first show.. can't wait to see the others! I'll be ordering the rest!
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|Although the story is gut-wrenching and almost unbelievable I thought the book was a little dry and did not have me hanging on every word.
B00D3XAA4M|1.0|I expected more information. It was not worth the download. I deleted it almost immediately after putting it on my kindle.
B001NA6096|1.0|Prepared to watch this movie on the way home from CA (on the airplane). I think it should be a good movie but I can not watch it as it got cut off and then it expired. Don't have time in the airplane to get tech support. I wish I can find out the end of the movie!
0061438294|5.0|Very simple to reed and follow all the tips that Joe Navarro is telling in his book. Joe Navarro uses a lot of photographs to teach all  movements that means something else.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun I have really enjoyed it! The only thing I don't like is that some of the stuff you can only buy with gems.....other than that it is GREAT!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|We read this and felt it was not as good as his first two books. It seemed like a lot f different stories that never really came together in any cohesive way.
B00E194KGQ|5.0|Amazon needs to put edited version in the title. With no easy way to return to get the correct version, there needs to be easier ways to correct these problems.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|I am still trying to learn all the extras on this program.  I did not get it to be social though.  The map loads really fast though and follows very well, probably better than Navigator.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought it last week, took me about 10 minutes to hook it up (it connected immediately to my iPad, iPhone, and my Windows & iOS laptops)<br /><br />This is a real game-changer in many respects.  For starters, it can turn almost any TV (those with HDMI ports) into &#34;smart TVs&#34; that can now be networked at home or office.  You can watch YouTube video, Netflix, and other content right from your smartphone.  It's not perfect (yet) - Google still has to get the iPad/iPhone/iPod integration 100% complete - but that shouldn't be long in coming.<br /><br />The kicker for me is the Chrome browser plug-in.  With that installed, it basically allows you to share & view any browser-based content as well.  Looking forward to more features as the product matures.
B003VVAE4W|5.0|One of my favorite shows. Well written, great dialogue, great acting and suspense. I can't get enough of Veronica Mars!
159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is one of my favorite authors.  The books are so well written and captivating.  I'm always a little sad when I reach the end!
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I have read and mostly adored all of McEwan's novels so I was anxious  to read his newest.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the dreariness of what could have been an interesting backdrop for an exciting thriller.  Maybe only James Bond gets the good cases!
B0076UXKDG|4.0|I tried the best knock-off at half the price but it just didn't measure up.  Even though it was well made (magnesium shell, etc.) and looked official, it had deficiencies.  The MB-D12 Nikon is just like all the other Nikon pro camera battery grips I have had except it costs almost twice as much!  Built like a tank with the same quality as the D800 it goes on.  So I bit the bullet and paid  too much for the good of the camera.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I liked the story and the world the author has created but the characters were to simple for my tastes. I would recommended this book for a teenager but not for die hard fantasy fans.
B0052OSTOS|2.0|Yikes.  Sorry folks.  Some people seemed to really like this meditation.  The woman's voice was so unpleasant to me, that I won't listen to it again.  I thought it was pretty bad.  I'm through with meditations, unless I know the person narrating it.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins is one of the best! ....And the characters and technology made this was an exciting and highly entertaining novel
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I was very pleased to find the four movies in a blu-ray set with lots of extra info. Nice packaging too.
0307352153|5.0|Speaking from an introvert's point of view...it's like the author knows me personally. So refreshing to finally hear praise for this personality style.
B002KLOPF8|5.0|I've been in the army, and this movie is definitely worth watching it, it is very realistic and fun. highly recommand.
0062073486|5.0|I read this book in a few hours. It's very hard to put down! It's definitely the best of the Agatha Christie novels I've read so far.
140006922X|5.0|I believe in GOD but have no faith in religion especially the Christian faith and their pagan practices. It is with that mindset I approached this work and it made much more sense to me; it was more verifiable information based on historical evidence available. I especially appreciated the fact that it reminded us that Jesus was a Jew and one who questioned the status quo. A must have for anyone seeking to understand Judaism and the Christ-ian movement which evolved from it at that time.  The spin-off of misguided moral teachings meted down by Christ-ians can be debunked by understand who Jesus really was in context with the times; so it surprises me not that those whose agenda this work threatens would flood the reviews with 1s and 2 stars...  I believe that this work proves that the bible is just a predecessor to todays blogospheres like twitter: some people pass on facts and some just spread the message the way they wanted it remembered or interpreted.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|No more need to carry a notepad around with you - this ap replaces the pen and paper.  And what makes it better is that you can have the same note synced on all of your devices - so you can write your shopping list on your computer, and look it up on your iPhone or tablet.  Brilliant in its simplicity.
B006C45LHA|4.0|I enjoyed this movie enough to buy it.  It expands your imagination beyond the same-old-same-old, and with Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell, Keith Carradine, it's backed by solid acting.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! I really enjoy the strategy aspect and it was easy to learn. Five stars!
B005544V6A|5.0|I love law shows and this one is quite entertaining! The cases are interesting but I'm more into the side relationships within the law firm
B009C7JS14|5.0|Works great and its free and free is even better knowing weather conditions are important to me especially when sending my kids to school since they walk.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Use as a recruiter and as a job seeker.  Great tool, but can be time consuming.  Be sure to keep it up.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|An amazing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. It had deep insights into the politics and personalities of the Civil War and abolition of slavery.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Love the book! Went to my kindle fast and it's there forever! I love John greens work! I definitely recommend getting it
0316113077|5.0|This book is a must have for anyone who wants to design very unusually cakes that are works of art.  I was impressed.  It was a gift for my niece who wants to be a pastry chef.  It was added to her collection
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love wonder zoo its so fun and addictive I hope that every one who plays this game loves it as much as I do
B005FVNIW6|3.0|I found it so hard to get into, at this point I am almost forcing myself to read it because I am stingy and I hate to think of the money I wasted..
B002RVCD0U|4.0|So I'm a terminator fan and haven't seen one since the third one which i did NOT like.<br />I was surprised how good this one was.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book so much. Amazing, Suzanne Collins writes with pure, raw, power! Thank you for writing an awesome book trilogy!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downtown Abbey gets better with each season.  What I really love about the show is that it more positive than other shows.  They never leave you with a depressed or sad state after an episode.  There always seems to be a positive message.  Love this show!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Such a fun game! Only disappointment was not enough levels. Hopefully more levels will be coming soon! I would recommend this game to all!
6305428557|5.0|A very good and humorous movie with lovely Welsh scenery<br />A good reproduction that we have now watched on three occasions.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I have only seen one bad movie that Adam Sandler had anything to do with.  This movie was NOT it!  This was cute and very keep ya on your seat....
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I didn't think I would like this series but now I am hooked.  The story lines are fresh and surprising.  The casting is perfect.  Watch one episode and you will be hooked too!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This is a differrent story than that of say Hood Winked.  I like the characters and my daughter loved it!!!!  She especially liked the tooth fairy because she lost her first tooth!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was assigned to me for a reading project at school. I usually hate those assignments, but I'm glad for this book. It is a story of an awkward teenager and how he battles high school. It is a must read.
B0002KVULG|5.0|The best Dracula movie ever made.  A classic.  I have yet got to watch the whole thing, but so far I am pleased.
B0067AC5KA|3.0|I did not like this book. It was very long and overrated and I can't believe they made a trilogy of it. After an accidental purchase from my friend I decided to give this book a try and I was not impressed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about so I bought the first season.  Couldn't get enough!  Fabulous acting, and what a fairy tale for us all...
B004B4RCDE|5.0|The new world order has begun. Rihanna is so talented and she makes hits with each release. This album's must-hear songs include &#34;Man Down&#34;, &#34;Complicated&#34;, and &#34;California King Bed&#34;, besides the one's you've already heard like &#34;S&M&#34; and &#34;What's My Name&#34;
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Some poignant moments, some goofball moments, but makes for a fun watch.  As the parent of teenagers, I found a bit of myself in both parents.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Bring the living room to life with Uno Kindle tablet edition. This game is fun and can keep kids entertained for a while.
B006GLMHBM|5.0|For mature audiences only!  Finally rewatching the series with my teenage daughter, and getting just as many chuckles out of it.  But there are also lessons to be learned!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|As well-written as Walter Isaacson's book on Steve Jobs is, he cannot come close to the essence Steve portrayed. The mysterious Jobs always had something up his sleeve to surprise his customers, and I feel this book didn't completely portray him.<br />However, anybody who enjoys Apple products and/or enjoys reading about Steve Jobs should definitely give this book a try. It's a long but easy read and very knowledgeable.
B00756GRUE|5.0|i love dive watches. this Seiko solar is a good compromise between straitght diving watches and more conventional ones, this includes also the chrono functions and the solar power provides an add on as you do not have to change the batteries.<br />as far as the durability, let's discuss it in the next years, when i would hopefully confirm the good quality of Seiko  watches.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It's a fun game and I am enjoying it. It's also really frustrating too. For example, logs are really important in item creation, but when you need 300+ logs to make medicine, that's pretty obnoxious. It gets more irritating when I have to make 2 or 3 of these on an almost daily basis. When I healed all my people, it told me I wouldn't have anymore sick for 1 day. I don't know what their definition of what a day is, but I've had people sick almost 2 hours after getting that message. Because of this I feel like I haven't progressed at all.<br />You can visit your friends that are playing in other towns and even send gifts to help each other, which is a pretty nice option. Problem is that this option doesn't work very often. You'll get a &#34;Connection timed out, try again later&#34; message and that's just to access the visiting screen. The fix I've come up with for my game is to exit the game, use a task killer to completely close the program, and then try to visit again. Also, when I try to visit as soon as my game opens, it usually works.<br />When I finally get to the visiting screen, my friend's town only shows up about 15% of the time. What's even more ridiculous is that the game doesn't acknowledge your friends on the developer's network either. It'll tell me I have no gameloft friends that are playing the game, when I actually do.<br />Other than those couple of problems it is a fun game.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Overall most of the book is common sense things. However we may not always remember to them, so i guess it's a good reminder. I'm not sure i agree with the chapter on mentorship , it seemed to me like it went back to her point about women feeling uncomfortable about being looked upto.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Good show to have all the rights to -Good job Amazon!  WE are hooked on it.  Hope you get it next season's too.
1490313370|3.0|The book offers young people some good advice about taking advantage of your own good points and the importance of idea generation. But repeating &#34;I love myself&#34; to cure a serious disease is a strretch. Sticking to the more fundamental advice is helpful.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Great action as I said and of course I am a fan of all the actors, so all the little one liners are not lost on me. Trying to follow the story dosen't make my head ache, just great entertainment.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I just can't seem to make myself stop playing this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Every time I get on, I fall in love with the game!<br />My favorite dragon is the<br />..wait for  it ...OBSIDIAN DRAGON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I read this to my seven year old niece and she loved it. Great for bedtime because no dark parts last more than a chapter. Lovely.
1400031567|5.0|The book arrived earlier than expected, was in great condition and was packaged securely.  Once you read this book you will probably want to do what my wife and I have been doing, that is buy more Wallander books as well as others written by Mankell.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This book offers a hilarious take on the coming of the anti-Christ. It is a slightly dark comedy and is not for people who are easily offended by religious satire. Armageddon doesn't seem like the type of subject that should be made funny, but Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett manage it amazingly!! They play with the how human error and free will can play a role within the ineffable plan.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|This book is a very accurate description of Islams view of Christ and the only problem with it is that it hides this important bias.  In fact, nowhere is it stated that the author is representing his deeply and sincerely held Islamic Faith in this book.<br /><br />The view of Christ described in ths book came not 40 years after Christs life, as did the Gospel of Mark which the author claims to be too old to be accurate, but was perpetuated more than 600 years after Christ walked amongst us on Earth, when Islam was born and both Jewish and Christian leaders rejected Muhammad's claimed revelation.<br /><br />The Jews rejected them as Muhammad was not a Jew and therefore could not have been a prophet of the Jewish God and the Christians rejected him as Christ told us there would be no more prophets after his time, hence Islam has to discredit both Jeudaism and Christianity in order to create a theological claim to be descendants of Abraham and to worship the same God that Jews and Christians do.<br /><br />Although in America, Muslims are certainly within their right to hold such a view and publishing such materials, hiding the books and authors bias is deceiving and hence why it gets a one star.  Had this book been honestly presented as the Islamic view of Christ it represents than perhaps it would not have been met with so much controversy, but I'm sure it would also not have sold as many copies.
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|I got this for my cheap Android toy tablet. But it seems no better than my other free dictionary (Advanced English Dictionary and Thesaurus, which also works offline). AND MW takes GOBS more space. So I'll uninstall and archive it for now - I didn't bother to test voice input.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|So well written you have to wonder who did the translation or was it written in English. Great characters and plotting. I am a fan after reading one book. Will not be my last.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|This app would not run on my 'other' 7-inch Android tablet. It would start but then show an 'Internal error' message and stop. It did not matter whether I was connected to the internet or not. It needs Amazon Appstore running online too. Couldn't you have told us of this limitation? Since I can't use it offline, I'm uninstalling and deleting it!!!
B0036S4B6M|1.0|First I saw the Netflix show, then I watched the author being interviewed. But I guess it didn't prepare me for the fact that the series does not match the book. There are drastic differences that just killed the book for me. It read more as a public announcement about the conditions in the prison and an unjust system. I wouldn't read it again.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Overall, a good book. I experienced conflicting feelings of skepticism and hope. Some sections where the author explains physiological aspects of his experiences were difficult to follow.
0553582038|5.0|I have to admit that of the books I've been pressured to buy for my kids, these books are amongst the most complex. So many names, plot twists, and views of the same events by different characters make this intriguing. Not a self-contained & complete world in the Tolkien sense, but I think the author accepts that no one but Tolkien has quite figured out how to accomplish such a feat.
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|Just make sure you want the radio edit.  I don't mind it, but others may be disappointed if they have to have vulgarity to survive.  Great song though.  I always enjoy Daft Punk and Pharrell is talented.  Good combo.
0553801473|5.0|I confess to purchasing only due to my 16 yr old's badgering. However, after discussing aspects of the books, they sound interesting and very complicated.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Great film, well directed, scripted, and acted.  Even better the second time.  [Note:  Amazon requires four more words.  Oh my.]
B00007J36V|5.0|Though written by Dylan, I've never heard anything, by anyone, better than Percy's Song. I've heard Dylan play it (on a bootleg of an early show), but even had he put it down on vinyl (unlikely due to the origin of the tune) it would never have sounded like this. Never. And &#34;Genesis Hall&#34; remains one of my favourite RT compositions.<br /><br />There is a YouTube recording of RT playing it at a composers symposium. Suzanne Vega & Loudon Wainright are also there. Listen and understand how RT is from another musical universe than most other musicians & composers.<br /><br />I know &#34;A Sailors Life&#34; is an important cut, but one has to be in the mood to listen.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a very quick read -- perfect for a long flight.  Loved that it was written through the eyes & thoughts of a dog.  Will definitely will read another book by this author.
B009ZQFSRA|5.0|Enjoyed this tale of a so called perfect society and the struggle between law and morality.  Action was fun and to the quick...don't blink.
B00AW57L96|5.0|This book made you think even after you have finished reading. I am not sure I agreed with ending, but then I decided I did agree. Very thought provacting.
B00CHILW64|5.0|This movie had our entire family, which includes a 15 year old son and 10 year old daughter, very entertained. Finally a good movie that we ALL enjoyed.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Sure it is a little annoying that you have to have it open when you play games you have bought on it, but the great prices during the summer and winter sales make it well worth it.
0525425772|5.0|I choose 5 stars because I personally love John Grisham and this book was fantastic - as usual!  Go John!
B0063IH60K|5.0|first was on the computer now I can take it where ever I loved playing this game on computer and with cards just loving it!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|bingo blitz is a fun game and a little addictive and a little frustrating.  but i cant quit.  where new friends are made too.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very addictive love this game. Get very frustrated when out of credits to have to wait 24 hours only downside
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Well it is fun for kids to play. If the kids like the movie then they will like the game. There are no virus to it. It will help the kids Learn their left from right. If the kids like Victor on there they have to defeat him, they have to try to unlock the little girls fluffy Unicorn and it is hard.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loveed every word of this book!!!!<br />I Read it in 3 days I sent wait to read the next one
B005544TRQ|5.0|When I avidly watched USA, my shows were Burn Notice & Law & Order: CI, so it generally takes me some time to warm up to anything new. However, I do have an affinity for programs that deal with the law, and the law looks totally different until you have to use the law. I think that may have been the reason I did not watch Suits for the 1st 2 seasons: I just wasn't interested. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the last episode of Season 2, all because it was coming on while visiting family. I enjoyed it, and since the 1st 2 seasons are included with Amazon Prime, I watched them.....in less than 7 days. I was hooked, and while the incredible outcomes are more or less rooted in truth to make you think, \\"That could happen,\\" it is entertaining enough to keep you there. The cast is very well chosen, and having witnessed first hand how attorneys truly have a science to the method of their madness, for nearly 2 years, Suits is a gentle remainder that such programs only feed the perception of the law is and what the law is not. In other words, IT IS WELL WORTH WATCHING!!!!! While I do not think it is absolutely necessary to watch the first season to enjoy the second season, it is always good to have a grasp on different references made at certain points during the show. The angle presented as to how the two main characters come together is cool, so if you haven't thought to view Suits, I think you'll absolutely enjoy it.
B003E74B24|5.0|I am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsey, when I first started watching Hell's Kitchen I thought that he was just a grouch (to be kind), but as I kept watching and googleing him, I found out that he is indeed a very nice person.  So I found his biography very interesting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We have waited for this application to show on our tablets and finally it did. My daughter's had downloaded the app on their cells so glad you can on tablets now. They enjoy playing this game and adore the minions and the movie. Great game so far.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I give Jaycee Dugard a lot of credit for having the courage to re-live her ordeal, I admire her for taking back her name and life by writting this book.  It was a hard read at times, (how can one human being be so cruel to another?)  It was a selfless act on Jaycee's part, it is a testament to how strong a human being can be, even when you think there is no hope....
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book. Actually I love the entire series. When the story line really gets in a good place boom the end of the book. Now I am waiting AGAIN for the next book. LOL. Gideon is such the strong character, looking for the love he has never really had. I can't wait for the next book
B000WMEAKC|5.0|Honestly, one of the only albums I own that I can listen to all the way through, non-stop, over and over again.  Great band.  First album as well and it is polished.  Great vocals and the beats are fantastic.  The original version of &#34;Apologize&#34; is lightyears ahead of the Timbaland tainted version.  Plus great songs like &#34;Mercy,&#34; &#34;Prodigal,&#34; and &#34;Say.&#34;  It's a fantastic album from the opening techno-vocals to the last chord.  It's six stars.
B005GCCJME|5.0|i just received a pair of these earlier today and i love them. the minute i tried them on i didn't want to take them off! they are so damn comfy you won't want to!<br />i would recommend these to a friend. they are also great for any1 w/foot problems. they also have a great fit to them.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|What's not to love about Season 4? It's got my favorite Doctor, David Tennant, and the inimitable Catherine Tate. Plus it includes some particularly excellent episodes, including the two part Silence in the Library and Forest of the Dead, and the two part The Stolen Earth and Journey's End. Allons-y!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Loved this book and couldn't put it down!  I've been a Christian for 34 years (at least) and a lot of the historical facts about Jesus were not that new to me as I've learned this before in a class I took at church.  What Aslan's book does is really make you think about what Jesus means to you and what message(s) really resonate with you (given the historical facts we know about Jesus).  Every religion has cultural roots and calls to us in different ways based on our culture and the time period we live in.  This book and the facts contained therein do not undermine my Christian faith at all.  Dr. Aslan is a great writer and this book is written in such a way that it doesn't drown in boring details but at the same time, all the references are fully verified and explained in the notes section at the end of the book.  If you want to know more about Dr. Aslan and his views on the book and Jesus in particular, look on the npr website for interviews with him as well as search youtube and the Huffington Post.  He has done many interviews that expound on his views on his book and I have found these interviews to be very helpful in understanding what I have read as well.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Well written and keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat action, just like the first book.  Very hard to put down.  I spent several nights, staying up much later than planned because I couldn't put this book down.  Images are so vivid.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|As always Matt Damon is a really great as for and very believable. Non stop a action thru the whole thing
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin is the story teller extraordinaire. He consistently undercuts the literary narrative we always expect. You can never guess what will happen.
B0052SF6CM|5.0|I thought I Created Disco was one of the most original and fun albums in the last 10 years. This one is every bit as good.
B0051MKMNC|1.0|If you currently own the Rated Version, save your money. The difference between the two isn't worth the acquisition, unless you need to hear a couple of x-rated words. In fact, there is so little difference between the two versions that the addition of the new version is somewhat of a joke, albeit a bad one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have finally gotten caught up with the past seasons and am anxiously awaiting the return of the series.<br />I enjoyed watching all the old episodes- at my own time and pace- via my amazon prime subscription.
B005JR47R6|5.0|One of the best TV shows ever. Obviously exaggerated, unrealistic at times, but it is a lot of fun and explores human nature
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Breaking Bad has changed me as a person! I give my thanks to all of the actors on the show for giving such powerful, moving performances, but I especially want to thank Bryan Cranston for being the actor he is. I highly recommend this show to anyone. Just amazing! I have watched all of the seasons, and now I am purchasing all of the seasons to own in my collection.
B000031XBQ|5.0|Truly Gold. All of their favorite well known hits. All the years of listening to Abba, and I never knew they did a spanish album. Simplemente perfecto.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This took so long to load because of great visual graphics, but I didn't really catch on to the game. It's all show and no sport. It just isn't for me, but kids probably love it.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|its a really great game but its way too short and easy...except for number 38 which i need help on! can anyone who's been able to complete it help me?
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Watched this movie with my granddaughter, and we both got lots of laughs from it.  The pranks that she pulls on Danny Divito are a hoot......
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was captivating! I fond myself so entrenched in the story that I would have to put it down and walk away, always to be pulled back to the pain and the joy.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|As an avid reader of all the Jack Reacher novels, I was pleasantly surprised how well this movie followed the book.  Cruise played a pretty good Reacher, so I enjoyed the movie.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan took a hugely controversial subject and expertly organized facts and information into a very readable and well annotated read.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Liam Neeson is type cast in this movie, so I kinda suspected that I knew which way the movie was going to go.  I wasn't disappointed (with the type casting of Neeson), but the movie was enjoyable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app!  Makes it very easy to feed my Pinterest addiction!  Well designed and very easy to use!  Thanks for doing a great job!
B00846REIS|4.0|This story will suck you in! You'll stay up just to see what happen next. If you liked 50 Shades of Grey, you'll like this story. The story line is similar.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|This book was very disappointing, nothing happened in it. Now I have to buy another book to find out the ending, very frustrating. I have read a lot of trilogies lately and most of them only have enough story for two books. Why are authors continually doing this, it's turning my off reading them.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|This is a great movie for the family. I usually do not like James Franco's acting (no offense intended). However, in this movie, he did a wonderful job. He &#34;interacted&#34; well with the animated characters and played his role to spot. Plus, those characters were lovable. This is one we will watch over and over.
B00C8RBSYU|5.0|Awesome condition of this movie! Thanks for reading this! My daughters are having a blast with this movie! Aloha and have a great week!!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Once I saw the documentary on this incredible musician/philosopher, I had to buy the CDs too. Glad I did. I reminds me that everyone is responsible for living the dream and keeping it humble at the same time. Congratulations!
B0045TYDNC|5.0|This is just a good thing to have in the bag so you can enjoy guilt-free lens storage on the fly.
B00DHRLK84|1.0|Without igniting any debate about what would or would not work on the big screen, this Is not how i think a movie of all the stories in the (fantastic) book should look like. Some of the panoramic glimpses of the apocalypse are great but brief and don't come close to reconciling the bland hero, a pandemic scenario robbed of it's only hint of realism by gymnastic, sprinting zombies & having a character shoot themselves in their head. Marc Forster & co - you have robbed us. The only reason to buy the blu ray will be to find out how it went do horribly wrong.
B004QL7K70|5.0|It a great movie, Its hilarious.<br />It came in great condition, it was brand new and in its own case.<br />It was definitely a deal, I'll get more movies from them again.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book got better and better the more I read. The characters will stay with me for a long time.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I remember watching her perform on Britains Got Talent and shocked them all!<br />The powerful voice and her ability to hold the listener captive with her vocal lilt<br />allowing a soothing relaxation to overcome them.
B008OOYALE|4.0|The game is cute, but you have to be patient as it takes hours for dragons to hatch and breed. Other than that, game is fun and is good for kids as well as adults.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Another excellent read by Jodi Picoult.  Intriguing and relevant to the world today and the insecurities of young teens. Awesome!
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|All our four grandkids love it. It is a timeless story. One of Disney's classics. I would recommend it to anybody with kids/grandkids.
B002APU580|5.0|I love this movie so much and I really love the book. Keira Knightley is amazing. I cannot read the book now without having Keira's face in my head for Lizzy!!
140006922X|1.0|The book has an underlying tone of sarcasm, it's subtle, but it's there.  I find it amazing that this one gentleman seems to think that he has found the answers as to what Jesus of Nazareth was doing, and what He was thinking during the periods of His life that aren't explained in the New Testament.  This book is a feeble attempt at explaining Jesus of Nazareth away as a rebellious politico. However, this book is a subtle and pathetic pro-Islam propaganda piece aimed solely to gear readers away from what history has proven over, and over, and over again; that Jesus of Nazareth is truly who He says He is: I AM WHO I AM.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love the drama and the story lines.  Harvey and Mike make it so enjoyable.  And all the female characters are so powerful too :)
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|My husband and I really like this show. It is similar to Walking Dead in story line and how they work together.
0425263924|4.0|If you are a fan of the previous two books and are anxious to see where Gideon and Eva end up, then you'll definitely enjoy this book. Day continues on with Gideon and Eva's story and although only a couple weeks have gone by in this book, a lot happens in their relationship. It was definitely worth the read but because there will be two more books the end kind of left me hanging (it just stopped and I was left disappointed). So I would suggest borrowing it or checking it out at your local library unless you're like me and need to own the books you read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game!!  Way better than Subway Surfer.  It has the same concept, but you get to listen to the minions ramble.  Pure hilarity!!
B000FA5TTW|4.0|A beautiful, heart touching and powerful read.  The characters are real and the story full of the possibilities in life and after & a solid reminder of the possibilities.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Look...it's a frickin' fun film.  If you're looking for Citizen Kane go watch it...if you're looking for Logan's Run for a new generation watch this.
B008C20TDG|4.0|Something that explains food in terms of healthy fuel and not fad diets. Food isn't the enemy fake food is.

0307740919|5.0|I loved this book!  It was heart breaking and breath taking!  I especially loved being able to experience the time period of the book.  It was a time when community was real and active.  Don't sleep on this!  Check it out!
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|Absolutely wonderful product, but I do have a question: I noticed that this April 16, 2013 re-release looks different from the last box set.  Can somebody tell me if the extra footage (that was not included on the Blu-ray set) was included on this DVD release as well?  And are there any other changes on this set from the last DVD set?  Thanks.

B0010SKUYM|1.0|2016: NINE YEARS after the writing of the first book in the supposed trilogy that he was supposed to complete 2 years ago. Can you say LYING LOSER.<br /><br />UPDATE: It's a year after my original review and guess what? Still no book 3. BUT! There's a NOVELLA (short story) coming out in October for ONLY TEN BUCKS! Just double the price of the 2 COMPLETE novels. What a deal! Yawn.... I WOULD like to see the trilogy finished but I doubt I'll read anything else he writes. I just think it's disrespectful to leave your readers hanging for years at a time.<br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br />I'll admit up front that I loved the TWO books he has released in this TRILOGY(?). Having said that, it looks like he has moved on to children's books and left this great trilogy unfinished. He's written 2 children's books since the second book was published in March of 2011. According to Wikipedia, he says he MIGHT finish it in 2014. I'd wait until it comes out if I were you. The plot is pretty intricate so you'll have to re-read the first 2 anyway...if he ever bothers to finish.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|It wasn't a bad movie, just really hard to believe. I hadn't read the book, so the ending was a surprise...but could have been done a little more seamlessly.
B00475AYJQ|1.0|UPDATE: I was hoping he'd come out with the last book in March of this year, the other 2 were 4 years apart, both published in March. Now I'm thinking he just choked and can't finished what he started. What a loser.<br /><br />I'll admit up front that I loved the TWO books he has released in this TRILOGY(?).

I have to wonder how THEY'D feel about buying a house and having the contractor walk off with the job only two thirds complete; ESPECIALLY if he starts working on another house, just down the street.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I loved this book, it really kept me guessing and wanting to read more and more. I have suggested it to everyone I know.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a great book, as are all of Vince Flynn's books. It's so sad that this is &#34;The Last&#34;...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I went to graduate school in England, so I lived there a while.  There is so much of this show that, even though it harkens back to the early 1900's, is still very applicable to &#34;modern&#34; life in England today!  The caste-type divisions, unfortunately, are still in play, although not as obvious.  Titles and money and entitlement are very much well-settled-in there as &#34;tradition.&#34;  It is a bit foreign to us as Americans, but so much of that life holds lessons for us all - good and bad.<br />I say it is BRILLIANT, to use a British term!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good game to play. pretty easy and simple. its nice that I don't need to have the Internet to play.
B0086213XW|5.0|If you love movies that are real, this movie is for you. Beautifully done. Seth Rogan should do more movies like this, and Michelle Williams gave an inspirational performance, as always. Wonderfully written. Cinematography was beautiful. This is why I love Indie Films.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved it!  I cannot wait to to see the new season!<br /><br />Why are 6 more words required - now one!
B0090SI582|3.0|The X Men have had a bit of a troubled road these last few years. Following the great success of X Men 2 they followed it up with the equally disastrous X Men 3. Just about everyone hated that film, but that hatred was nothing compared to how people reacted to X Men Origins: Wolverine. And though people tend to like X Men First Class, I thought it was a bore. Better then X3 and Origins, but nothing when compared to the first two movies. To my mind they haven't made a good X movie since X2 even after three tries. Wolverine especially seemed like a tired character, having appeared in all but one X film and making a cameo in the one he didn't star in.<br /><br />Set a few years after the events of the third movie we find Wolverine alone in the Canadian wilderness living the life of a hobo. His hair is long and matty, his beard shaggy and filled with twigs, and his cloths look like they haven't been washed in weeks. He also has a thing about standing out in the rain, which oddly enough happens quite a lot. It rains more in this film then an average day in the UK. Anyway, he is summoned to Japan to say his goodbyes to a man whose life he saved during the bombing of Nagasaki. Along the way he falls in love with some random Japanese woman, loses his ability to heal,  and gets into fights with ninjas.<br /><br />The Wolverine is a film that somehow manages to make a lot of mistakes but falls short of making an error that would put it in X Men: Origins territory. First off the love story seems very forced and out of place. It comes out of nowhere and then just ends as if it never happened. It's as if the producers decided they needed some sex thrown into the film in order for it to sell and decided to force it in there regardless of if it fits or not. Likewise the main villain, Venom, is wasted on this film. She doesn't do anything, or contribute in any meaningful way to the plot until the very end of the film. She pops in every now and then to remind us she's evil, but she hardly holds the same menacing presence as Magnito or other famous X Men villains. She's mostly there, it seems, so that Wolverine has a fellow mutant to fight instead of just measly humans but they don't fight the entire film. So what exactly was the point of her being there? Why waste such an interesting villain on a film where she has no role to play when you have Days of Futures Past coming in the future?<br /><br />But despite these glaring problems The Wolverine never bored me, or disinterested me enough to start nit picking at every little detail. Despite the alarming lack of mutant on mutant fighting Wolverine gets a good dose of fun and exciting action despite his powers being gimped for half the film. It was fun watching a venerable Wolverine taking on hordes of ninjas even though he should have been killed many times over had his powers really been taken away. My favorite scene was when he was fighting on top of a bullet train and needs to use his cunning to defeat his enemies instead of just brawling them to death like he likes to do.<br /><br />The Wolverine is ten times better than the dreck that we've seen from X Men lately but still manages to fall short of the first two films. With the gross oversaturation of super hero films its films like this and the equally \\"meh\\" Man of Steel that will spell doom for the genre in coming years. These are films that cost huge sums to make, but with so many mediocre to downright bad (looking at you Iron Man 3) super hero flicks on the market people are going to eventually stop watching them. Here's to hoping Days of Futures Past being better.hardly holds the same menacing presence as Magnito or other famous X Men villains.

B003Y5H5B0|4.0|I used to watch the TV show 21 Jump Street, and while it was clever, I didn't think it was anything special. When I heard they were making a movie, it peeked my interest, but the previews made it look like it would be God awful, in one of the worst marketing campaigns for a film I've ever seen. After hearing some good things from friends and being that it had a good cast, I decided to give the film a shot and it far exceeded my expectations. Two of the dumbest and most immature cops on the force are sent on an undercover mission to infiltrate a local High School and find out where a new designer drug is coming from. Right from the start you could tell the film would lean more to the comedic side as opposed to the show, which was more dramatic. Going the comedic way, especially with the cast they had, was the right way to go, but much of the film was still unbelievable. Anyone who believes that either Jonah Hill or Channing Tatum could even come close to passing for High School student are completely out of their minds. Also, the speed in which these two idiots went from being the worst cops on the force to celebrated heroes was ridiculous. It would have been far more enjoyable if these guys just sorta stumbled into solving the crime, rather than all of a sudden becoming great cops. As for the cast, Jonah Hill continues to be the most underrated comedic actor in Hollywood. I have yet to see this guy do a bad movie. Channing Tatum was pretty good too, he's known more for his looks than his talent, but he fit his role extremely well. It was probably written specifically for his persona, similar to his role in Magic Mike, but he still is very good. Finally, the cast is rounded out by Dave Franco, the younger and better looking brother of James Franco, who for the very first time shows that he is more than just a kid, getting work because of his brother. He was very solid and perhaps the most believable and likeable character in this film. 21 Jump Street is nothing new,it's another cop movie that blends comedy and action, like almost every other Lethal Weapon wannabe. The story isn't better than the rest, but it is funnier than most of the other films and it has some terrific cameos.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I downloaded this game for my husband. He likes to play with our granddaughter. The only problem is that I have to get another Kindle Fire or tablet for my use.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|The formula for trilogies is simple, the first one is amazing, the second one is terrible, and the third one is pretty good. Almost all trilogies seem to follow this format, but Men In Black has always played by a different set of rules and as it turns out, the third film was far and away the best of the trilogy. In this installment of MIB, the notorious Boris The Animals escapes from his prison on the Moon. This is significant, because putting Boris away is what made Agent K's career and cost Boris an arm. Boris, determined to change things, goes back in the past to kill K. Once he does, everything descends into chaos and the Earth is at risk, so Agent J, goes back in time to stop him. Once in 1969, J enters into a strange new world where he sees that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Josh Brolin plays the younger K and is absolutely terrific, it was amazing and hysterical how he captures and mimics every single one of Tommy Lee Jones mannerisms to a tee. Will Smith is his usual self, with his quick one liners and terrific actions scenes, he hasn't missed a beat, even all these years later. For as good as the acting in this film was, the story is even better. Watching this film it's hard to believe the story is based on a comic book, because the writing really was tremendous. They took a step back and show what MIB and it's agents were like 40 years ago, at the very beginning and it was really interesting to see. Men In Black 3 is far and away the best of the trilogy and one of Will Smith's best films in years. Science Fiction is usual a narrow genre, that isn't for everyone, but this film does have something for everyone and for that it gets the label of a can't miss movie.
B006S053K8|1.0|Expected at least one laugh through the movie, but was sadly disappointed. The ONLY reason I watched it all the way through was to hopefully see Kristen Stewart kill herself because of her self-created problems. But, again, was disappointed.<br /><br />And it seems that they couldn't make up their minds on what year this movie was supposed to be set in. A brand new shiny Gremlin and many other new cars from the 70s, but a 1992 old beat up sedan? And \\"I'm going to get a new Mercedes with one of those compact disc players\\"? Make up your minds!

It is written from Hunson Abadeer's viewpoint (Marceline's dad).<br />So far it doesn't seem to reveal too much, it is more of a recap of the show written in such a way that it keeps the reader going.

Afterward, at table discussions, at least five people came up to talk about it, saying it was their favorite writing book.

B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|A fantastic movie with everything a science fiction classic aught to have; Stunning special effects, a brisk yet atmospheric pace, \\"aliens\\" and technology, (and my personal favorite element of this film) an excellent soundtrack. The score is from the same creator that did the soundtrack for Tron Legacy with a haunting futuristic feel. The whole movie has a very entrancing atmosphere as the audience is introduced to a gritty post apocalyptic Earth strewn with the refuse and debris of it's former self. This is artistically contrasted with the very cool looking clean-cut and bold design of the technology the survivors use, who are left surveying this dying world. The plot is fairly typical with nothing totally unseen however, this movie does like to throw a handful of plot twists your way of which I personally have never been a big fan. It isn't terribly confusing, but it does give the sense that the film-maker is high on them-self for being such a clever little story teller. Anyways, all and all this is worth buying and I would definitely recommend a hi-def version with a quality sound system. As a science fiction buff, I certainly intend to add this to my small elite collection (which is actually saying something as I only buy what I consider the cream of the science-fiction crop). Enjoy!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game is a lot of fun when you need to buy some time. You have make the ball they show on the box. Some are super easy and some are super hard. Get while it's free!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|well I use it many times a day, enjoy this so much as I do my kindle should have got it sooner.
0061122416|4.0|Paulo Coelho never dissapoints. His writing is always the same and his stories are always interesting to make it a page turner.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|&#34;GI Joe Penetration&#34; that would be hilarious. With a name like that for a porn it better be good. Seriously.
B000065U1N|5.0|The political waves are still churning about this incident but it isn't the fault of the war fighters.  This is a decent portrayal of what happened back then.  Having lost some friends, it is the best we will do to honor their memories. We lost them because of politics, not because they didn't do their jobs.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|exciting and fast paced. keeps you on your toes and constantly wanting to beat your own personal best. great weapons and amazing graphics
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I find and load this on every device I have. For a Christian it is great to have the Bible always available.
B004X75RK4|4.0|It is a good movie when you have nothing to do.  This is a very cute movie.  There is some nudity, but nothing more than you would see on basic cable.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the book but I was slightly disappointed by how it ended. Looking forward to a part II- if there will be one!
B009FTAH3W|4.0|This is truly inspiring but I am a bit disappointed to find several business ads of the author at the end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very cute game with plenty if twists that keep it interesting. The minions are adorable and i really recommend this for addictive fun. Love it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for more,more,more! Great acting with a fascinating story that is really captivating.  We also like seeing them at one time by watching on Amazon Instant Video instead of waiting to see them one at a time on PBS.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|This is another exceptional novel by Jo Nesbo.  We haven't read them in order but have enjoyed each & every one so much we do not care!
B005NGKLX2|4.0|The movie has a good actor in Sam Shepard but in this case he needs a lot of help from the rest of the cast. It was a so-so movie but the vendor seems to be very good in functioning as advertised I would be glad to use their service again
B005DD7H50|5.0|A great story from hopelessness to being limitless. Excellent direction by Neil Burger with edgy editing and amazing composition. I would recommend it.
B00DHMXJUG|5.0|This song is a perfect summer song... Though it does seem a bit off the riff of SUPERSTAR from Madonna there is no escaping that it is fun, breezy, and dancy
B0098XY5VK|5.0|This game I loved the first time I played it on the computer now that its in the app store its very fantastic like its a miracle of the game well I hope they make a number 2 hot dog obama!! lil!!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Still fun, entertaining, and different enough to keep an adult interested...or it did me watching it for the third time with three different grandchildren.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|I loved Adrenaline Mob, Flying Colors, and the other MP projects.  Hearing Billy's playing, mixed in with arguably the best drummer in rock and roll is an absolute dream.  NOT TO MENTION, the greatness of Kotzen, who's voice I just discovered recently.  Not only can the dude shred, but his voice is up there with the greats of Cornell and Coverdale.  Can't say enough great things about this album, it has been in full rotation since purchased and I can't quit listening to it.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|The game gives me something to do. I have found that the game has a bug that caused the game to stall.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|Tom  Clancy  is  by  far  one  of  the  best  authors  in  the  country.  A  great  read,  even  for  people  who  have  not  read  his  books.
B0063GORYU|5.0|My wife plays this game daily. She could not live with out this game. If she is not reading she is playing this gsame
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2 year old son loves all vehicles, and loves these puzzles.  It is amazing how well he does with them all!
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|My Grandsons asked to watch it - saw it twice - teaches a good lesson. A little rough in spots but overall a great show.
B00B78AIV0|5.0|Simply could not put it down. I was sorry when I was done.  I so wanted to continue reading it.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Grandchildren stayed for a week and we watched it multiple times.  It was especially enjoyable for the 7 year old boy.
B00BJNHACS|4.0|I've never seen a racing game quite like this. It's not always easy, but man is it cool!<br />Fun landscapes, music, and physics.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|For any great fan of Whitney Houston, this is PERFECT!!! It has all the videos for the greatest hits of all her albums!!! AWESOME!!!! Great for enjoying anytime! :)
B004GHNIRK|5.0|A must read for anyone living in the 21st century. It's chalk full of humanistic principles which use to be known as religion and spirituality. It's about how some people go awry with whatever they believe in. A must read book for any revolutionist.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|If your a traditionalist of the Sherlock variety this might not be for you, but if your ok with a bit of modern twist and gender bend then this series will tickle you intellectual funny bone, it is surprisingly fun and dramatic, very good creative balance with out getting to corny, and the interplay between the main characters is fun without being to sexually charged, &#34; spoiler alert &#34;  which I was worried about but luckily the writers keep it platonic &#34;whew&#34;
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|they deff went back to their way of the fist sound on this one with some awesome duets!! if you love FFDP well... ORDER NOW!!!!!!
B005MLP8E0|4.0|A classic movie that is still entertaining today. Masterfully demonstrates classic techniques, such as spatial composition, the power of camera angles, and the magic of makeup (All adult ages of Mr. Kane are played by the same actor).
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Good as all his writings are. When you finish you feel that you have been touched deeply my the hand of  understanding and recognize a glimpse of your old friend fate..
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is one of the best ever. I think it's good for young adults. The first relatable young adult book of read<br />  Love Olivia
B00BMR5HOO|4.0|although the forecast is not always accurate. easy enough to install and commoditise and it does have a nice graphical design.
B008BQLH52|1.0|This show had an interesting start, however, it lacks depth.  It's basically the same loop over and over again with no intelligent details or consistency to the characters.  The stories are sloppy and things are done just for the sake of creating drama.  If you're looking for a show that you can connect to as an intelligent adult, look elsewhere.  If you like to get high or drunk and then watch TV, then this one will do fine...but I'm sure you'd be okay watching The Home Shopping Network and have a better time.
B004QX07G4|4.0|If you enjoy Ellen, you will enjoy this book. It is written as though she is telling a monologue from her show, and while the rants sometime go on a while, I laughed quite a bit while reading it. I love Ellen!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This movie make me want to make sure I am not just friends with my co-works but that we more like family.
B00000F6LQ|5.0|That is all I know to say! Hahaha! My adult kids love this movie! Maybe I'm too old to understand it... But it's funny and weird all at the same time.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|This is a movie that fathers should add to their personal list to sit down with their boys in time of anger and hate or lack of communication
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Great production, good direction and sometimes a need for a script editor. I'm not always convinced that Jonathan Rhys Meyers is really Henry VIII but Natalie Dormer is a compelling Anne Boleyn.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Their intense relationship keeps the pages turning.  Their dedication to each other is to be applauded.  I can't stand editing for more!  It was wonderful and I very much look forward to more Sylvia!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|On the recommendation of a friend, my daughter and I watched the first episode of Season 1.  We were hooked and quickly finished the entire season.
B00555Z2OE|4.0|If you were a teen ager in the 70's Styx was a big part of the soundtrack of your life. This vinyl reissue sounds better than ever. These tunes were meant to listen to in order. The LP forces one to do so, big bonus is it sounds better also.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is a book for those with a willingness of disbelief. Believe in<br />magical things occurring? The occult? Monsters? Dragons? Wicked<br />Stepmothers? Etc?<br />If so, you will enjoy this book as much as I did. It's beautifully written<br />and plotted. It has feature film written all over it but in this case that's a good thing<br />rather than bad. For pure escapism and enjoyment, this is the best &#34;ocean&#34; at the end<br />of any lane that one could hope for.
B00536OCYG|5.0|The MFSL UHQR is THE copy to have, but who wants to spend $$$$$. The MFSL standard is next, but who wants to spend $$$$ (for NM). This is a nice reissue, and a bargain. A must have AOR masterpiece.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|great show good acting have watched it since it was on SCFY  Would purchase if I really had time to watch
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Happy book with great perspective on the subject of energy which Pam Grout writes about.  Easy to follow and easy to do experiments.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love it. It is one of the greatest apps ever. I got it and couldn't put it down until I shot every one of the guns. The only problem it has is there are only like five guns. Wish there more guns. A Russian Mosin sniper rifle would be nice. I'm going to get the original weaphones app. Still awesome though.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Great show, so happy to have it on Prime.  WHEN WILL SEASON 3 BE ON PRIME??????????  A;LFJD ;ALSDKJF ;ALSDKJF ;ASDLKFJ
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app , as much as I love reading ! Thank you for making it so easy u have a daughter and I have many activities to attend with her and I can not see my self carrying so many book, with this app I have all my books in one mini device :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|The most awesomeness game I've ever played my sister and I love it. She's 7 and I'm 13. She loves it. Worth it. Get it :)
1451627289|5.0|I love Stephen King and this book does not disappoint! I found it on this site and the price was great. It arrived very quickly and my transaction was very smooth. Thanks!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Side Effects is a story within a story. One is about the possible side effects of OTC's (Yes, over the counter has to be included) and in this case Prescription Medications and the other story is about greed, lust and revenge. I loved the premise of this story that involves the side effects of medications that range from itching to death and the possibility of murder.<br /><br />This story is very well acted by all with Jones (Dr. Seibert) and Law (Dr. Banks) taking their roles to heart and their co stars preforming equally well. The direction and the story is where this movie takes a hit by allowing the typical Hollyweird junk in to spoil this story somewhat.<br /><br />I will try to be careful and not spoil to much if any of the story by detailing the rediculous actions that the director/writer allowed to take place. I know they do some of these stupid things so the can keep the stars in the spotlight and or directly involved in the story, but come on lets try and get somewhat real!  Dr. Banks has a ethical and moral conflict with his patient Emily (Rooney Mara) that has caused him so much trouble and yet he is still treating her?  Dr. Banks does some pretty crazy things that shall we just say are a little OTT (over the top) and not very well planned or thought out for his problems. The DA's actions and reactions to Dr. Banks initial meeting about his findings involving Emily's case was not quite believable considering what he did. The DA just wanted to forget about everything and let to case run its course. WTH?<br /><br />The story was not as well thought through as it should have been and instead of a really intelligent and thought provoking thriller with an extremly talented and attractive cast we have a good thriller with an extremly talented and attractive cast.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the clues were given to us to let us know that something was up with Emily or if they were just oversites. Two really stuck out and smacked me in the nose. One was when Emily was at work and the other was a cop. I am not saying what happens or how it happens just what to look for. There are others, but these really stuck out. For me it would have been much better not getting any clues whether intended or not.<br /><br />The story does have a few twists, but they just don't live up to a Hitchock type thriller/mystery moment or movie for that matter. I think everyone will enjoy the ending to this a little better than average movie with its talented cast.<br /><br />I will give this a 3.5 star rating for the acting and an ok story that had a lot of promise, but suffered from some strange SIDE EFFECTS1<br /><br />Rating 0 to 5<br /><br />Story = 3<br />Acting = 4+<br />Direction = 3<br />Thriller/Mystery = 3<br />Gore/Violence = 1<br />Sex/Nudity = Yes/Yes limited to 3 scened I believe.<br />Cursing = Yes, but very sparingly<br />Entertainment Value = 3.5
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is the best game I ever play, thank you amazon and gameloft<br />It is the best game I ever play
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book grabs you imagination and doesn't let go until the book ends.  Love this story a great read, highly recommended.
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|I deeply regret losing so much time watching this &#34;movie&#34;. Zero. Nothing is good. And I was à Die Hard fan.
B00846REIS|5.0|Reading book number three now. Great, easy reads! Loving the third book as well! A co-worker recommended the trilogy to me as my &#34;Summer Reading List!&#34;
B006LA6IW2|5.0|A very good book with an inside look into the war and the events that soldiers and especially seals go through
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The fact is, this show has good acting, class and it is a great story. The characters are versatile and you have the good/bad scenario. I also appreciate the ability of the producers to keep the language clean and the dialogue interesting. There are no porn scenes to wade through. The time span (early 1900's and on) is interesting, the costumes delightful and the scenery is beautiful.<br />I hope it continues
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Really good read.  I was enthralled from page one and couldn't seem to put the book down.  King is awesome!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|It won't work worthless thank god it was free I have downloaded it on my iPad and hp and works fine
141659521X|5.0|I love all of Vince Flynn's novels.  He and his novels will be missed.  I now have the complete collection.  I was not a reader of this type of book.  Since I found his works and the Mitch Rapp series, I have made it one of my favorite things to read. I highly recommend then.
B001F8VRLM|5.0|This played great, and my husband is a real Two and a half Men fan.  I like the series also, very funny.  I didn't have a problem streaming this and we bought the rest of the series, or rather my brother-in-law bought the rest and gave them to my husband on DVD.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because I couldn't give a higher rating!! Couldn't put it down from start to finish!
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|The 3D movie just increased the movie enjoyment.  The price was great for 3D and BR and DVD.  I could only rent this in DVD, and knew the BR would be better, the 3D is even better yet.  Glad I made this purchase.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|It may be a little slow at points but all around it's a great addition to any collection. Especially if you enjoy Sci-fi genre books, this one is definitely a classic by all means.
B004HO6I2E|3.0|Funny movie and shipping was fast. Its ok for a few times of watching it but i wouldn't buy it again. just rent it
B005O7PXNS|5.0|My favorite show on tv. Season 4 has been the best in my opinion. It made me laugh and cry at the same time. I love all the characters and especially love the romance side of it.
0525457585|5.0|Extremely imaginative and wonderful. It was really thought provoking and interesting!! I loved learning of the entire story and being able to adore certain characters and creatures. I have always adored the first movie (my second favorite of all time) and knew the book had even more involved in the story. Read this book to learn more. I was so addicted to reading it that I hardly put it down and was able to read it so quickly. It has valuable lessons. There are a few graphic violent bits and one swear word, but otherwise I think this would be great for a child to read if they are 13 and older (or adults like me, who truly can enjoy it). In case you are unfamiliar to the tale, it is about a boy named Bastian who gets mocked and has a difficult homelife situation. He feels truly down in life but comes across a book which he loved to read so much that he felt as if he were part of the story. Of course there is SO much more than just that to it! I don't want to give anything away!
B00C061I3K|2.0|I might play this a second time, but I don't think so. A couple of the songs were OK. Get Lucky isn't as big of a deal as people are making it into.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It was a pleasure to watch each persons story unfold. The series was very fluid and left you with I cannot wat for the next episode .
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Something to read before falling asleep.  After having been through four books I feel like this story is perhaps a book or two too long but I'm sure avid fans would disagree.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was wondering which way to go as far as purchasing online movies.  I just purchased a new smart TV for my basement but there was no way to get the movies from Google play easily.  Sure I could move the Google TV I have in my living room to the basement but Google TV on top of a smart TV is a bit redundant.  I could go through Amazon but there is no way to easily view that content on my phone.  Nothing quiets a kid in a restraunt like a movie.  This is the answer, A simple way to stream Google play content and Netflix (and I'm sure much more in the future) striaght to the brand new TV.  And it's portable, If I want to finish a movie in the bedroom no problem, just unplug from the basement and plug into the bedroom.  It will pick up right where I left off.  I think I will be purchasing more in the future so I don't need to move them though....$35 bucks is kind of a no brainer.  Anyway...Great move Google, exactly what we needed, nothing more.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This is a great novel. It's classic Grisham...lots of suspense and a great plot.  It is an awesome beach read!
B002LANLDK|5.0|This movie lay out the reason of the Fast Five movie, love the movie and hopefully the 6 should have a good story too, waiting for it to release.  Anyone who has Fast Five and should have this one too.
B004X75RK4|4.0|It's a fun, feel-good romantic comedy. The storyline isn't anything special, but the chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds is great.
B000J2BRQU|4.0|First I thought it has link between the movie but it is a complete different story then the Fast and Furious movie, I like the story and unfortunate Lucas Black is not in another movie, wish one day he can join the team and his father is great.  I will recommend anyone who like car chase or driving to have this movie.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It's better than I expected.  I usually don't go for survivor-type movies, but this is great!  The character development is outstanding and great actors.  Nice job!
B00B4804Q2|5.0|This movie is the back bone of Paul Walker history in the story, need to have this movie to complete the whole story, if you like Fast Five, you would like this one.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|I love this game on the pc, so I was excited to see it as the free app of the day.<br />Having said that, I will not actually install it until the permissions are fixed.<br />No one has the right to search for my accounts for any reason. Nor should they need to have information about my networks.<br />Finally, if all of the data is on my tablet, which at 50.8MB it certainly should be, there is no reason to need network connection at all.<br />The more developers punish honest people who purchase their apps, or get them legally free, the more honest people get frustrated and look to other options.<br />And lets face it, the network access is mostly for them to check for illegal copies of their apps. I should not have to pay the irritation price for this.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I loved it as a little girl :) And a funny movie that anybody who is into Pixar should try out
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Blood Song is an Epic in every sense. It contains all the elements of truly great adventure! A condemned man relates the story of his life and the readers will find themselves absolutely sucked in. Can't wait for Book 2!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved it! I thought it was a wonderful book! There were so many good parts in the book. I think it should be a movie!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Good read, can't wait for the next edition coming in August.  Look forward to more Hugh Howey sci fi/futuristic books.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|What a great read. Baldacci has found a new character to replace Oliver Stone. Fast paced full of twists and turns.  I read The Forgotten and fell in love with Will Robie!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Like any Hosseini novel, it delivers. I couldn't put it down, stayed up way too late at night reading. I've read his other two also, very good.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Very addictive game, I LOVE the challenges and the slot games are cool too!<br />I started playing in February and I'm on level 108 already.As you advance and clear cities, you level up and win credits. You also receive daily credits and you receive additional credits when you level up. If you run out of credits, you have the option to buy more credits if you desire.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Got the book on Kindle and read it in one day. Good writing. Basically the author takes the earliest sources in the New Testament, pares away stuff that scholars think was added later, and puts what's left into the context of the times...what would a contemporary Jew or Roman have thought of this? If I hadn't known the author's background, I would have guessed it was written by a cultural Christian with a very literal mind.<br />Typically biblical scholars (based on my cursory reading) run either very conservative or social justice-value-loaded. This author seems to have no other agenda than to explore how Jesus was received and dealt with. One of his points: it doesn't matter if YOU believe in miracles, the people around Jesus believed. Does an excellent job of putting the Mark, Matthew and Q document stuff in a timeline with various arising Christian traditions. Very easy for a layman to understand.<br />About 25 percent of the book is chapter headings, each followed by a useful commentary on the various scholarly works used to document that chapter.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|The Winter Village line of Lego sets has quickly become one of my favorites and this wonderful edition will not disappoint. The set employs many advanced building techniques and is not something I would recommend for younger builders. This set took roughly 2 1/2 hours to complete and is worth every minute you spend on it. I always put my Lego village under our Christmas tree and I am constantly getting compliments from family and friends on how unique and cute it is.<br /><br />Like all of the other sets in this line the Post Office is not the only focal point. One of my favorite parts of this build is the towns gazebo with the band. Lego has done a wonderful job of creating a truly complete town setting with inclusions like this and the large Christmas tree included with the Winter Village Toy Shop (10199) and the skating rink that comes with the Winter Village Bakery (10216)<br /><br />Whether you're looking for a holiday project for your family or your a fan of Legos this set is sure to delight both the young and old.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Childish at times, but very entertaining.  I'm sure it helps that I am a child of the 80's and knew most of the references made in the book to the pop culture of that decade.  I even started watching Family Ties on Hulu.  I think if you were born after '87 this book might be lost on you, but I was glued to the page by chapter 3.
B009AMALLM|5.0|Number 4 is not as great as 1, 2, or 3, but great to add to my collection.<br /><br />Thank You
B0050PYNOY|5.0|This movie is stupid, and funny, but made to be obvious and intelligent, I really think danny mcbride is super funny, this movies is well made and true to the time, but everything else, like how they talk is modern mixed with traditional, take a minute and go rent this or buy this movie, its about as funny as they come and what you expect, if you like the humor of will ferral, and if you liked pinnaple express. It is very under appreciated
B004LROUNG|5.0|just finished this book today, have to say at first I was not really a fan till after this book.  I would have to say that more of his books might be in my future reading.
B00BSBX9TE|5.0|Went to Australia recently and remembered this book from years ago and thought it would be well worth another read.  I was not disappointed at all. A fantastic read!
B00E4W40C4|3.0|Does anyone know if this 3d 'collectors edition' also has a 2D Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy included?<br />I would hate to think that 20th Century Fox is pulling a fast one on us like Disney did with 'Oz'. I didn't buy that one either.
B005IGDW24|5.0|As usual gohastings came thru with the exact item I needed and promptly.  Thanks so much the whole family loved the movie and anticipate the new Smurfs 2 shortly.  Thanks Amazon too for having a venue for things I always need. Mrs. A. Stoler
0743487486|5.0|I have found it to be very eye opening and I find myself highliting throughout the book...it's a helpful tool for my husband especially.  He has been a step parent to my children.  I have been confused by his way of parenting versus my own and I believe it will help us come to a resolution
0803731094|5.0|The Gruffalo is my favourite children's book (and we read A LOT in my house).  Most we get from the library, but this one I bought...not for just us but also 10 more as birthday gifts. I don't know a kid, or adult, who does not love it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This author never fails to deliver.  This book is about family with all their flaws and weaknesses, yet leaves the reader with a sense that when all is said and done, values,  integrity, love, family loyalty and character mean more than wealth.  In the end, tangible possessions  may empower, but life is more than that.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|While I liked the premise of the book, I felt the layout of the different stories was somewhat lacking. Just my opinion.
B001F6ZIXW|2.0|The show is caught somewhere between fantasy and real-wild fantasy. Does not bear any resemblence to real life. Should be a cartoon series for little kids on Saturday mornings.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|Husband loved it
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The Weather Channel is almost always the first app I download when I get a new device. Not anymore. I do not like the new format at all. The map is cumbersome at the very least. Every time I open it or go back and forth through pages it always asks me if I want<br />to turn on the location finder.  I do not have it on for a reason. Could they at least make it so you can opt out by adding  &quot;do not ask again&quot;? All in all really dislike the new app.  Please either try something different or better yet go back to the old app.  As any granny would tell you &quot;If it ain't broke don't fix it.  I hope always to be able to use the Weather Channel's app,  but will not if this new site stays. Best of luck and hope to see you in t h e future.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Husband loved it
B004YXE438|5.0|I love puzzles. this one is challenging with a new twist. Try it! It's addicting. Some of the pictures are a little boring, though.
B000LE16VW|5.0|JUST LOVE PATRICK SWAYZE MOVIES. ONLY ONE MORE TO FIND AND HAVE EVERY ONE HE WAS IN. THIS MOVIE MAKES ME CRY EVERYTIME I WATCH IT.  HE WILL BE MISSED.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|This show did an amazing job of combining the right amount of suspense with fun and laughs.  The acting was amazing and the singing phenomenal! I would watch this season again!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have seen all the James Bond movies and found them pretty entertaining.  Aside from Sean Connery, who is the best JB ever,<br />the other actors were pretty good.  Daniel Craig was excellent is this movie as a young JB. The rest of the cast were very good as well.<br />I would highly reccommend this movie if you like high action and suspense.  Casino Royale has it all.
B000002TYX|4.0|Volume 1 of the anthology series highlights many of the tunes the group recorded that were never released on disc, tunes that other artists, like the Coasters, Buddy Holly, and others performed on disc. The group's interpretations are sometimes stunning and entertaining, sometimes down right great (like &#34;How Do You Do It&#34;), and sometimes very raw in their performance. But it's great to see how the group evolved over the months and years early on.<br /><br />These tunes are followed by alternate and studio demo/takes from their very earliest albums, plus from &#34;A Hard Day's Night&#34;.<br /><br />Like Volume #2, this disc begins with a solo, at home made, John Lennon tune, &#34;Free As a Bird&#34;, which the other three took, added more instrumentation and vocals to it, and came up with a groovy tune.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I don't care for these types of games. I thought it was going to be one where you go from level to level in the game...Guess my 9 year old is a little beyond the pre-school/kindergarten level of this
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It was full of twists and turns and exciting action. The whole series is really good
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a great game for kids. My kid won't stop playing it. After Chelsea the movie he wanted to be a leafman
145210655X|4.0|The litte Luke is so cute ! And our &#34;what-ifs&#34; are answered !!! Lord Vader has the opportunity to raise the young Skywalker !!!<br />And I think would be easier to convert him to the Dark Side later he he . I  must have book for any SW fans although I do prefer the jokes, the phrases , the references in the Dart Vader and the Little Princess .
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I really enjoy this app. It can be relaxing or challenging as I try to beat my previous score. It is a great way to stop worry!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is amazing! With the creepy factor and the different puzzles, and the card game that allows the player to option out of the tedious hidden object section of the game, it's right up my alley! A surprising addition to my game collection.
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|I LOVE this game. Truly wish there were more games like this one. Challenging yet win-able, great graphics, fun storyline.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Undignified finch.  U. Enriched  under business besties to YouTube channel ryd to be home from my chemical romance and I can have to be home for the ride is a thousand excuses for the.
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|Smooth animations. Nice change for a puzzle app instead of same ol stuff. Too few levels for a paid app and not sure why it needs network permission.  No IAP.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game caught my attention as soon as I saw my wife playing it and I just had to download it. Fantastic app with flawless problems att....
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a good game. Had a rough start trying to figure out how to play the game at first though.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|The puzzles were challenging enough to keep my interest occupied for hours. Got this app for free and do not regret it. I would pay full price for it. Eager to start the sequel!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It's really a nice game ! And it's fun try it ! I love chasing the animals X3 it's fun
B008K6HN8I|5.0|With ES File Explorer, and access the files on all the flash memory in my tablet, and across my home NAS.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE this game it's a lot of money but worth it.I play multiplayer with my brother and cousins and we survive together.New updates are awesome.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|I like Jack's approach to writing and performing music.  No, it's not polished and slick like Mutt Lange would produce, but it is still a gem.  And it certainly can't be called &#34;over-produced&#34;.  Raw, unrefined, and true.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is really good.  I like shows and movies from this time period.  I am looking forward to many more.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I purchased this set when it was highly discounted and it was a great bargain for all 4 movies.  Not having any of the movies on disc already made it an easier decision.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|A very good book indeed.  My only reservation is that Dr. Aslan did not address (to my satisfaction, at least) how the traditions of Jesus as a peaceful prophet arose and gathered currency in the years prior to the destruction of the Temple.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Thankfully I bought this book used.  And any reader with a knowledge of the subject can see through Aslans trickery in an instant. Of course if any Muslim would bring the same effort of critical analysis to the study of Islam as he does in  this feverish attempt at biography, we'd all be better off. Of course he fails here, but maybe he could better spend his time shattering the myths of Islam.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|The final episode was the best ever????  I was waiting for the happy ending that they all returned to a &#34;tickertape parade&#34;.  That being said the finale' was worth every minute of watching and I loved Admiral Janeway trying to advise her younger version.  The releationship between 7 of 9 and Chakotay was a nice surprise.  To see Tuvoc in the future being absent of logic was a little disturbing.  All in all, I would recommend this series to anyone that is a Trekie.  I started watching this series when it was first broadcast but for some reason, didn't keep up with it.  So nice to see that as an Amazon Prime Member that I could watch all of them.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is one of the greatest series with World War II as the backdrop ever made. You'll find yourself totally riveted by the characters and the amazing performances by the cast. There's really not a bad actor among them and you can tell they really cared about portraying the real-life participants in the best light possible. I've watched this at least three times now and it never gets old. Maybe I need a life, but I am fascinated by what these men went through and how they survived the war. Of course there's great action, but also some powerful drama as well. This Blu-ray set is actually an upgrade for me from the standard DVD. If that doesn't prove how great I think Band of Brothers is, nothing will!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Never, in all my playing games (and I'm 51) have I had so much fun with a game that I actually completed it. This was my intro to this type of game genre and I hope to get more of these from this company.<br /><br />My only complaint that I have is the same as everyone else's - too short although I can understand this when I discovered this was this company's first game. I mean why go through all that hard core programming if no one likes it.  Well now that you (the devs) know how well received this was, hopefully your next one will be longer (please oh please oh please! :)<br /><br />I discovered I had to use the hints but only sparingly as I figured out the mechanics of the game. Hint to first time players - look at EVERYTHING through the special eyeglass you get at the beginning. Even if nothing special shows up if you don't use it you'll miss some important stuff which is one of the reasons I had to use the hints when I did. I forgot to look through the eyeglass. Duh<br /><br />The graphics and gameplay are extraordinary. Sharp, HD, graphics and easy to see/read words made this game super fun even with my p***-poor eyesight.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy the game as much as I did.<br /><br />Played on a Kindle Fire HD 7&quot;
B004QX07G4|5.0|Need a laugh? A gut-wrenching belly laugh? Read this book...it's common, everyday stories with a twist that only Ellen can give.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|I missed this one at the theaters and have been meaning to watch it ever since.  This past weekend there was nothing good on TV so I decided to rent LET ME IN.  I am so glad I did!  I love that this story plays by all of the vampire rules.  1. Vampires Kill to Survive;  2.  Vampires cannot go out in the Day Light; 3. Vampires must be invited in; and 4.  Vampires are afraid of crosses (OK, so the movie really doesn't show this, but it is a rule so this happend in my mind!)  Although I do like some of the new \\"Vampire Lite\\" movies, this story stayed true to what not only makes a good vampire tale, but a great movie.
B005544V6A|4.0|I dug into this show after reading several reviews about how under-appreciated it is - I love an underdog. And it's great - well acted, quite funny and smart, impressive sets and terrific writing. I'm really enjoying it!
B004KBSQBA|5.0|Best album I've bought all year! I've always loved Paul Simon--this music makes you want to move--you cannot help but move!! It's perfect to use for any kind of exercise you'd want to do, as well as just pleasurable listening!
B008602KQI|3.0|It waited too long to get to the games.  romance with Peeta and Katness flat. not exciting like in book
B005DJREJS|5.0|This series is addictive.  I started out early on a Sunday and finished before dinner.  I love a good love triangle and this delivers.
B00009YUPY|4.0|It works very well - better than the wireless competition!  Good value and I love the fact that I don't need to feed it batteries.  Good for the environment.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Still going strong in season 2.  Looking forward to seeing how the characters develop and grow over season 3. Some time the jumps to a conslusion are a little over the top, but I really like this show.
B000SW2F8K|4.0|Quite a find on Prime Instant. Husband and I looking for something to watch on the romantic side. Penelope Cruz is so beautiful to watch and actually made something of this very silly script. Could have used an Antonio Banderas to balance her out...Worthy of a view..
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Entertaining, but they really nailed the tongue-in-cheek humor in Red 2.<br />Malkovich is funnier, and the cast is tighter in 2.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have not read one quite like this.  I still cannot fathom how the main character knew how to do all these things and get away with it.  One minute there are eyes everywhere, and the next minute it seems no one is paying attention.  Part way through the book, it became almost a completely different story.  It was eventually tied together, but it was hard to believe most of it.  I finished it, so it was okay, but not great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is awesome you have hours upon hours of fun.the one only thing I would change is how.much you have to pay for.the other games
B004H0M8EA|5.0|This book will make you think about the effects of man on his environment. It is an important work that shouldn't be missed.
B005544V6A|5.0|I stumbled across this show on an airplane one day.  Came home and got caught up on the past two seasons.  Really like this show so far.  Seems a little bit like, &#34;The Good Wife.&#34;.
B001MSMULG|5.0|From the first sentence, I was captivated by The Kill Artist.  Silva really knows how to weave a web of suspense, build characters that chilled your bones and kept you guessing all the way through.  Trying to read the last 20 pages and still finish my work was my most impossible mission!  I recommend this book, and your introduction to Gabriel Allon, to anyone who likes a suspenseful (and probably fairly accurate portrayal of how spy networks operate) novel.
B00DJZI2N0|4.0|If you've ever read the possessive/stalker books - you know, sleeping with the enemy, rose madder, etc - you know the general flavor of that kind of book. Girl meets boy. Girl is swept off her feet. Girl figures out boy is psycho. Girl tries to leave. Boy won't let girl go.<br /><br />This is that kind of book. But, it's written in 2 different time periods: when she was in the relationship with the bad guy, and trying to get her life back a few years after the bad guy. The writing goes back and forth between these two time periods, quite seamlessly, too.<br /><br />It's very, very well written. You can see where she's coming from, how she falls into this relationship, how she tries to reclaim herself afterwards, and why she can't quite do so.<br /><br />It was so very believable that it was downright disturbing. I had a hard time putting it down, but I also almost wish I hadn't picked it up. Unlike most books of this ilk, I can't write it off as unbelievable. The author has done a very good job of portraying evil - deliciously seductive evil. And I'll flash back to this darkest corner quite unwillingly for a while, I think.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I love the mind of a child and a childs fantasy where reality and fantasy are interchangeable.  Very good reading
B006C1DH92|1.0|Halfbrick should be ashamed of themselves for releasing a game with huge achievement popups that OMITS the feature of actually letting you VIEW your achievements or what ones you don't have yet.  Sloppy port from iOS where achievements were viewed in GameCenter, but for Android they just removed the GameCenter and link and did not bother to put in an internal achievements list. Incredibly shoddy work.  If they update it to add the new Google Play achievements I will change the review to 5 stars.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|We never knew sheep could be so entertaining and witty. Very good for kids of all ages.Even my husband enjoys it.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|My problem with this game is figuring out what I'm supposed to be looking for. There's nothing to let me know so you're just tapping on anything waiting for something to show you've hit the mark. Gets tiresome quickly.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|We have always enjoying downloading movies from Amazon but not tone of the movies downloaded never showwed up on our TVIO
0374533555|5.0|The book is packed with tons of great data and useful tips. This is one of those books you will probably find yourself referencing for years to come.<br /><br />A most for anyone in sales, marketing, or any form of business. It is also helpful with any profession where you interact with people. Its been a great help to me and I hope for you.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this cd!  I have every cd he has made and this one does not disappoint!  I would recommend this to anyone country music lover or not!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|To begin with, this is a very attractive watch, especially for wearers with smaller wrists (for reference, I wear even this band on the second-to-smallest notch). If you are seeking a functional aesthetic and prefer a smaller watch, this one is absolutely worthy of consideration. The movement works more than adequately, I find I have to adjust the time to remove about five minutes per month, which I do on the first of the month, when I adjust the date. The recessed, off-angle adjustment crown does a nice job of not bashing one's wrists, even when you wear the watch working. The clear back that reveals the clockwork never fails to impress children, not to mention adults who enjoy observing the mechanical workings of things. The self-wind is effective, I wear it most every day and have never had it stop on me.<br /><br />This watch costs little more than all-plastic \\"sport\\" watches, so if you are a gentleman on a limited budget who has no interest in dressing like a 10-year-old boy, but is not interested in dressing like a want-to-be country club member either, this timepiece offers is a fine choice.<br /><br />After reading reviews here, I was a little wary of how durable this watch would prove when exposed to vibration and moisture. Mine has taken who-knows-how-many hours of running an orbital sander and quite a few dunks in water. It's gone shooting skeet, been cycling on gravel roads, experienced plenty of wood splitting, even a little firefighting--- in sort, I wear it everywhere, and it still goes. For the price, I could not be more pleased, were it to fail tomorrow I'd likely buy another-- or certainly, at least, another Seiko. Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome. Best game ever. My favorite power up is banana splitter. It's awesome.<br />Hope you like this game. You should.
B00821OX98|4.0|I'm reviewing season 1 but after seeing part of season 2.  I'm actually working in the film industry, so my critique is a bit harsh.  Even if I reviewed this right after it would be the same.  The beginning is why it's 4 stars instead of 5.  I'm going to start out with the negative so that you are braced for it and can overlook it.  By the second or third show you will be at least somewhat established and love it.<br /><br />I love the series, however I got one beef with this one the the way it started after so much already happened....too much.  I think the season would have been better had they started it back in time a bit more.  Too many holes have to be filled in and as many as they did I think I would have liked the season earlier had they started it back a bit so the main characters could have been introduced more properly.  The way it started, they threw you right into the middle of the invasion.  Things could have gone back in time still giving room to fill in holes for content.<br /><br />But what is done is done... the producers won't care what I think at this point. LOL<br /><br />The good thing is just about everything else.  They fill holes of the past in as you go, unexpected events, etc etc.  Some is predictable enough to keep you satisfied yet plenty is unpredictable to keep you on the edge of your seat at times.  I don't have time to write a book here but they do a great job with allowing main or supporting actors dieing and replacing them with new endearing ones to keep it fresh, still keeping core characters.  Even some of those are not at risk of dieing or becoming aliens.  They do a great job in keeping things fresh in a war world that is cliche.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Unique spin on the traditional zombie film. Cute and light-hearted with some definite dark moments (especially scenes with the bonies!). Starts out a bit slow -- lots of inner dialog -- but picks up. Overall, a good movie.
B001MKQS4O|5.0|Having grown up during the lifetime of Truman Capote and seeing some of his actual interviews on television many years ago, I found this movie to be compelling.  Some actors are born to play certain roles.  Just as Salma Hayak seemed to channel the spirit of Frida Kahlo in Frida, Hoffman does the same with Truman Capote.  Mesmerizing performance.
B0049985XW|5.0|Great movie.  Engaging from start to finish.  Even though I have seen it multiple times I still watch it in suspense waiting for what will happen next.  Love the old prospector who is able to navigate the pitfalls of boom and bust.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|My husband and I love this show.  We did the &#34;marathon&#34; viewing of Season 1 and went on to Season 2.  All of the characters have something going on, so it's not just about Harvey and Mike.  I highly recommend this series.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I really enjoyed the first half of the book.  But towards the middle of the book it turns south.<br /><br />When the vampires and werewolves go head to head, and the tween heroine can't decide who she loves it just got a little too sappy.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|The whole theme of this movie &#34;there are some things are better left uninvestigated&#34; is what I like, along with the LA noir and Jack Nicholson, John Houston and outstanding character actors.
B00819ER0Q|5.0|This is an example of what a movie CAN BE. Imaginative, thought provoking, entertaining, funny, sad, inspirational. What more could you ask for? Sort of has some of the qualities of Groundhog's Day, another favorite movie of mine. Try it you might like it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Definitely get this game it is better than any other game you can get on your device that's free or not so click the download button and as soon as you play it you will love it and want to rate it :):):):) I &lt;3 it

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play everyday and never paid any cash, all free games. Really enjoy the game,played other bingo's found this one to be the most fun.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Enjoyed the intrigue and thought process by the author. What is a basic story plot kept me guessing to the end- I appreciate a book that totally engages me. Worth the read.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|if you are willing to put up with the outragious amount of adds, and even if you try to close the window, it takes you straight to the internet.  There are at least 8 adds to get through before you can even begin to play. So annoying!
B009PU2SX8|3.0|Do yourself a favor and check out the iTunes Session before buying this.  Hearing him perform most of the songs from this album that I liked (except Travis County) was much better than Blak and Blu, IMHO.  It has 7 songs from this album (9 total), and I didn't really care for the ones that were missing anyway.  Something to consider.
0385344333|5.0|Lee Child has done it again.  He comes up with some great stories and I love his Jack Reacher guy!
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Such a great film. It's nice to have classics like this available on prime. Streamed perfectly, no issues at all.
B00BIPORC8|5.0|I don't watch a lot of tv, but of the shows I've seen, this is one of the best.  My wife and I love watching this together.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|You know a show is good when you watch the series more than once. I watched 1 whole season in 1 day the first time
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Season four was another excellent piece of the series. The ending was a little bit weak, but it does make me excited for season five.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Best Darius Rucker yet. You can't help but play this C.D. a couple of times, and then you will be singing along with every song. Just done a road trip, and played it over several times.
B007SOQBCM|1.0|It will freeze out of no where. Then you try and try to get it to work but it doesn't. It takes multiple times of uninstalling and reinstalling to work. Needs a lot of work.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|acting I thought was superb,  both hero and heroine ( Mr. & Mrs. Hitchcock very believable) , and the stress that they,<br />especially Mrs. Hitchcock went thru was very eye opening.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great read. Hard to put down. John Grissom fans will love it. I wish there were more fun books like this to read in the summer!
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|This was enchanting I all most fell into the book and I would read all of the series because it is your fantasy written in words
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I enjoy puzzle games, so did enjoy this game. That being said, I think you could have had more puzzles, or more levels...and the story line could have been developed a bit more. However the puzzles were fun and kept me entertained while playing.<br />Looking forward to the next one :)
B005OCHOZS|5.0|When my wife recommended this book to me, I had no idea of what lied ahead. I've heard of UltraRunning before, but going through these brilliantly described runs..  I feel that I understand now, what the sport embodies. To know that one can push them-self beyond what's deemed humanly possible, while maintaining a Vegan diet, has inspired me to not only maintain my own Vegan diet.. but to also push myself beyond my own walls of existence, in hopes of finding something greater..  Thx for sharing this amazing journey of yours, Scott!!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|its a little hard to put down and I'm not a really big fan of this type of game.but it really Sucks you in and makes you think.nice GFX and runs well on Fire first gen.it was the FAOTD but...and its an easy but~it would have been worth the $2 their asking. but I still know I didn't pay for it so it easier for me to judge but still..a solid game.from a gamer...really.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|Was considering buying this DVD,like I have with Planet Earth and Blue Seas. I watched an episode on the Science channel and just couldn't get past the terrible narration. Tried without the sound but it just wasn't interesting. What possesed the BBC to use Oprah Winfrey is beyond me. Attenborough was great, Weaver was great but Oprah Winfrey! Just can't get past the \\" Pat me on the back, I'm Oprah \\" attitude in her manly voice. They should redo this one with a better narrator and I would gladly purchase it.
B00E194KGQ|3.0|This is the cleaned up version for radio. Sounds good but edited for cursing. Do not buy for the full FFDP experience. Easily refunded money and purchased Deluxe CD set with Auto-Rip. Get that one instead.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game on my kindle fire! Its very fun to play when I'm board. this game is awesome.

B00A6CT012|5.0|I have read the blog for a while, but this book was what I needed for the final push into a zero waste lifestyle. I can already see how much freedom I now have and I am so excited to share this with my family and friends. Thank you Johnson family, you've changed my life for the better.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm fairly astonished as to how well this works for $35.  Every promise Google made about Chromecast has so far been kept.  Setup was easy, literally 3 steps.  It's actually kind of amusing to see these three steps laid out in a tiny instruction sheet.  Once it's up and running, using a smartphone to beam Netflix or Youtube onto the thing is also fairly simple, though the Chromecast app is useless.  Video and sound quality for these apps are dependent on the overall quality of your network, but I had no complaints here.<br /><br />The big deal is how well Chromecast works streaming an open tab from Chrome.  I tested it out using HBO GO running in Chrome.  Does it work perfectly?  No, it does drop frames and it is noticeable at first.  Still, it's very watchable and the quality is honestly better than I would have expected.  App selection is presently limited, but that was clear going in and Google has made it clear they will add more in the future.<br /><br />Pro: Low price, easy setup, solid overall quality<br />Con: Limited app selection, room for improvement in tab streaming<br /><br />*UPDATE* 7/31<br />It pains me to say that my Chromecast has stopped functioning properly.  After I switched it between a couple TV's it no longer gives any audio or video signal to the TV other than a brief picture of the startup screen.  I'm somewhat baffled as to why this is the case, I fired off an email to Google support but haven't heard back as of yet.  I'm not optimistic they can really do anything about this.  I've knocked off a couple stars as a result of this event.  I will update again pending the results of this nonsense.<br /><br />*UPDATE* 9/22<br />I ended up returning my Chromecast for a replacement, since they were sold out after the initial release I only just recently got a new one.  The new one works perfectly so I'm changing the score to 4 stars.  Once more services and features are added I'll likely add that final star.<br /><br />*FINAL UPDATE* 12/17<br />I've been nothing but pleased with the Chromecast since September and now that new services are being added I can't justify giving it anything less than 5 stars.  I ended up buying another one for my year-and-a-half-old Sony smart TV just because the Chromecast interface is so much better (no competition there, Sony's UI is laggy and inefficient).  2014 should be a big year for the Chromecast, personally I can't wait for Aereo support!

B005D4YOFK|5.0|I resisted these sandals because of the price but finally broke down and bought them after too many failed experiences with other cheaper brands. The reviews were so good that I decided to go for them. I've had them for a week and I really like them. They fit well, look good, and I can walk in them without any problems. Definitely well constructed so it would seem they will last. I walk my three dogs about 3.5 miles a day so the sandals are getting a good test.

B00C81LYH2|4.0|As a collector edition Barbie, I thought I'd be more wow'd. While she's very pretty, it just seems like they cheaped out a bit. For the 25th anniversary, I would have expected more pop, more dazzle. The silver snowflake dress is delicate and lacy while complementing her earrings perfectly. Unfortunately, there's no other jewelry to be seen. No rings, no necklaces, nada. Also, while I realize this is a collector's edition, it seems to me that she would have been a bit more versatile if she had been more poseable. Her makeup is nice, but the box seems a bit flimsy and I'm not sure how well it'll hold up in the long run.

140006922X|5.0|Pretty clear that most of the one-star ratings haven't actually read the book. If you check out the interview on Fox with Reza you'll see the kind of reflexive intolerance that's responsible for most of the low ratings here.<br /><br />Summary: this book deserves to be a lot higher than the 3.5 stars it's at now.
B000SEI230|5.0|Many details in this book were left out of the movie, and detail is what this writer is all about! So if you have seen the movie, read the book too. It will be worth your while.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|The late Ian Richardson is amazing as chief whip, Francis Urquart. If only our pols could be so interesting..the miniseries is better than the book.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The surprise was how disappointing the ending was. I don't like to see the bad guys win. I blame it on Hollywood and growing up in the 50s. As bad as you think things are - they get much worse. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. I was warned, but I just had to see what the fuss was about.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY??  I ABSOLUTELY love this entire album!  There's not a song on here that I don't love!  And again, when you buy in MP3 format, you get it right away!  I was listening to the whole album within about 5-10 mins at the most.  THANK YOU!

B00E0S52K6|4.0|I came across Buddy Guy when he released his last album Living Proof on which he did a song with B.B. King.  Then a while back I saw where Beth Hart recorded with him for a new album, and I've been looking forward to Rhythm and Blues ever since.<br /><br />Although Buddy Guy just turned 76, he shows no sign of slowing down.  He still delivers blistering guitar solos as demonstrated on \\"Justifyin'\\", \\"Messin' With The Kid\\", and \\"\\" to name a few.  Some songs have a Blues Brothers feel to them such \\"What's Up With That Woman\\" and \\"Poison Ivy\\".  Guy also has a number of collaborations.  My favorite is \\"What You Gonna Do About Me\\" with Beth Hart.  I loved the Hart & Bonamassa albums, and she does just as well paired with Buddy Guy.  Gary Clark, Jr. stops by for \\"Blues Don't Care\\", and this one is another win.  However, I did not care for Keith Urban on \\"One Day Away\\".  The song is actually quite good both lyrically and instrumentally, but I just didn't think Urban and Guy went together as naturally as his other guests did.  Finally, I wanted to mention one last standout track.  The haunting \\"Whiskey Ghost\\" is really the closer of the first disc as the 30 or so second instrumental adds little.  Overall, this is a very good collection of new blues recordings from a legend who shows no sign of slowing down.  I highly recommend this album to fans of Buddy Guy and similar blues guitarists.<br /><br />Download this:  What You Gonna Do About Me
B00936A0RU|5.0|We went and saw this at the movies and absolutely loved it. I got it for my husband for our anniversary and he can't stop watching it. Love the story and the actors!
B005FMZWD8|5.0|The watch is precise and great looking, buying another model.<br /><br />Folks at Macy's, etc. have nice watches but way over-priced and not as good looking as this one.<br /><br />Cheers
B00BC3IKWE|5.0|What another awesome album!  I know I tend to say this about every song I buy here, but it's the truth! I love every song!  If you like a song or entire album, you can find it HERE, on Amazon!  I highly recommend trying it out if you haven't yet.  THANK YOU!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Unique story lines and writing make this a great drama!  So realistic and sad that it portrays an existing drug world.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I agree with most of the other posts, but will add a few details I have not seen covered elsewhere.<br /><br />Agree with others that Netflix works great, as does youtube.  However, I have other ways to do this and was buying for the googlecast feature (sending any video straight from Chrmoe browser).  Good news is this works with password-protected web sites much better than playon and is easier to use (higher spouse - not wife - acceptance factor ;)  Unfortunately, it is unwatchable.  Audio/video are way out of sync and stuttering.  From an ethernet-connected htpc it is iffy but watchable, but over wifi from my laptop not at all.  My network wifi and same laptop can support live tv streaming from my hdhomerun via windows media center, so it is not a weak network issue.<br /><br />I bought mine a few minutes after the announcement and had not thought through one obvious drawback.  If you don't have HDMI pass-through on you stereo receiver, think through your audio setup.  You may need an adapter or have to send audio through your TV, maybe have to change your universal remote settings, etc.  If you have a new-ish tv this is not such a headache for Netflix from your phone, as it uses hdmi control and can adjust the tv's volume from there.  This does not work with googlecast, but you can leave tv volume up and adjust the video's volume on screen, just as if you were watching it on computer.  Also I cannot say whether this works with hdmi passthrough as I don't have it to test.  It does work through a rocketfish wifi wireless sender.  I hooked mine up to that and used usb from my xbox to power it (powers even when xbox is off).<br /><br />All the marketing and demos say you have to be on the same \\"wifi network\\" as the chromecast to use it.  You just have to be on the same network and subnet, not connected through the same access point.  Might only matter for a few readers, but I can use this from devices attached to the network via the same access point, a different one on the same network, ethernet or MOCA bridge.<br /><br />Set up is easy, but changing your setup is not.  It has no setup utility or access web page.  If you need to change your wifi password, put it on another wifi access point, etc. factory reset button and re-running the setup prograam was the only way I found.  If you have to do this, make the second setup from an android phone instead of pc if possble.  Gets into your registry settings the first time through and it is hard to make it try again from the pc.<br /><br />Bottom line - if you want to be an early adopter and wait for features and upgrades, get one of these.  I am not sending it back, but would if it had cost more.  If you are looking for a device for netflix, this is easy to use and very small/unobtrusive.  If you want Netflix and other content, you might want a roku or similar device, use playon with a device you already have, or get this and wait for the development to catch up.  Once it does, this might become a really neat gadget.

B007MDB71O|5.0|After I finished reading the first 3 novels from this series, this movie spent 2 months at the top of my netflix queue reading \\"long delay\\" before I decided to just buy it.  I ordered the movie on amazon after seeing all the positive reviews.  Most of the people who hate the movie don't realize that the John Carter of Mars Series actually inspired most of their favorite sci-fi material.  Star Wars, Superman, you name it and it was probably inspired by the Princess of Mars.  It's just a shame that Disney did such an awful job marketing this movie.  They spent a lot of money on it, but talk about throwing it down a sewer.  The movie itself is fantastic!

B005UKJX4E|5.0|There's a good description of the film in the trailer, and the movie as whole does not contain much more dialogue.  The theme of the film is the struggle between nature and grace/love and the ultimate triumph of the latter.  Love triumphs because it links together all things, overcoming spatial and temporal connections and, ultimately, death.  The mother, who looks like she was modeled on a character in a Botticelli painting, represents love, the father nature.  The central event of the film, the death of a son at age 19, is never portrayed or explained. It cannot be explained, of course; yet, it belongs to nature, apparently, the realm of the rational. This is one of several failures of nature, failures that are shown here without explanations.  The father is a success engineer (yet he considers himself a failure); his son an architect.  The static straight lines of the products of their professions are juxtaposed with the flowing curves of sand and sea.  Ultimately, there is a kind of synthesis, a doorway separate from all else on a beach.  Here, the architect belongs to nature, but I think the point is that even his work, taken in the proper way, can be a doorway to eternity.  Though each stage of nature is transient, the whole is eternal and, thereby, pervaded with grace (love)--if we can but see it.  The film ends with a scene that again imitates a renaissance painting--the cast in positions on a beach--all together, all apart--in an eternal love.  The film is beautiful and profound--but it's also often heavy--even clunky with symbolism--and unwatchable.

B0006AAS5G|1.0|Received the Invicta Men's 9211 watch today. Packing was perfect. The watch itself is a turn down. The crown and the push buttons are so user unfriendly that it's not a simple task to change time/date/chronograph functions. The crown and the push buttons needs to be rotated counterclockwise to pull out the crown or to press the push buttons to make adjustments (In the manual Invicta says it is to facilitate water resistance but I have had other water proof watches before and none made fuss like this).<br /><br />The other horrible thing is the metal strap. It is so cheap and light weight that it appears as if it will break into pieces anytime. Seems like a strap of a 10$ watch. I have been wearing FOSSIL in the past and the quality of the watch speaks for itself. The metal strap for FOSSIL is so strong and heavy that it feels you have worn a decent watch.<br /><br />Apart from this is  Invicta's oversized wrist band. I already read about this before so had to order a 16 Pcs toolkit for adjusting the band size.<br /><br />I will never recommend this watch to anyone...<br /><br />I live in Sweden and ordered this watch from amazon. I want to return it but apprehensive about the return shipping charges that I will have to pay :(

B003G4W49C|4.0|this is a very interesting psychological study and interesting from both points of view. ender is a very gifted child who is recruited to save the world. we see how the grown ups manipulate him and how he reacts. because we see both points of view we in some ways know more than ender (but we do not really know more than ender) he is aware of the manipulation too, but doesn't understand the extent of it. but he does know the stakes he thinks and has to make some serious choices. i was afraid i wouldn't like the ending, but i did, both of them.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Ok so I really enjoyed this book for the most part. It had some slower clunky moment's but it kept my interest pretty well. It was my first reacher novel and I was a bit nervous to read it because I serve with MPs and I generally cant stand reading or watching military theamed entertainment. Fortunately he didn't put enough military stuff in here and what he did was vague enough that he didn't mess it up so that I didn't get irritated with minor details. Probably won't read the next book though because it already had a couple mistakes in just the first few pages. Wish he would get a consultant to proof read for him so those of us who are in the military can not start yelling things at the book like \\"For the love of God specialists are not NCOs!!\\"

B000059TEQ|4.0|I rented this movie from my local library yesterday and I really enjoyed it. It is simple but there is a certain charm to this chick flick. I believe it mostly has to do with Ali MacGraw's performance and character.<br /><br />Many people call this a tearjerker, but to me it almost gave off a heartfelt and warm feeling. Watch for yourself and see what you get out of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a GOOD and FRESH chick flick - this is coming from a reviewer who hates your typical slapped together romantic comedy. I might be watching it again before I return it to the library.

B003C5FMEE|5.0|I was standing in a Barnes and Noble browsing for new titles when one part of my mind asked \\"What is that wonderful Tower of Power style music playing in the background?\\" Well, it turned out to be Trombone Shorty on his \\"Backatown\\" release, and I purchased it immediately.<br /><br />At first I was a little annoyed with the vocal tracks that interrupted the instrumentals. However, I soon realized that they were needed as leavening and for variety, and after a few times through the CD, I began to enjoy them for their own sake. My favorite of the vocals is the 10th track, which starts out as a decent (but not exceptional) \\"met her on the dance floor\\" song and is transformed and elevated to something transcendent halfway through by one of the most blistering, raucous, joyous trombone solos I've ever had the pleasure to hear.<br /><br />And the 12th track (\\"Fallin..\\") another vocal set which is IMO the weakest and most disposable thing on the album, still serves as a setup to the next instrumental (\\"The Cure\\") which is the heaviest, bone-crunching funk piece you are likely to experience in your lifetime.<br /><br />So it all works out. After playing \\"Backatown\\" nearly non-stop for a couple weeks on my car stereo as I ran errands, drove home from work, etc., I am convinced that it is damned near perfect and deserves a place in the collection of anyone interested in this kind of music.<br /><br />More, please.
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|Saga is one sweet, engaging series, full of colorful characters, colorful story and colorful artwork. Its Eisner award is well deserved. On to Vol. 2 for me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book seems to be a look into the future of mankind and the ability to control others. Excellent detail both in the description of the silo and the characters. I generally don't read this genre however really enjoyed the story and found myself really rooting for the good guys.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|One of the best books I've read.  I've read several books on motivation etc but none come close to what Darren Hardy writes in The Compound Effect.  I started practicing his principles.

B00AWBNNAG|4.0|This is great and has lots of instructions for legos that are easy to read, and has a great brick list if you want it.  My only critique is that you have to scroll around the screen to see the entire direction.  This is ok for an adult but hard for my 5 year old (who is able to read and put together legos on her own with the paper directions she already has!)<br /><br />The search tool really makes it easy to find what your looking for!

B00BB8SKPW|2.0|The description of this movie is misleading. It is a nail bitter for the first 1/2 hour until the plane crashes but the rest of the movie you get to watch the main character drink to excess, have sex and use drugs. A very depressing movie.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Hands down one of the best books EVER!  Since purchasing my Kindle three and a half years ago I've read more than 150 books.  This book ranks in the top five.  Try as I might, I never could figure out each character's thoughts or actions.  I've read \\"The Help,\\" \\"Crooked Letter Crooked Letter,\\" and \\"Mudbound\\" each dealing with race relations in the South.  As good as these books were they pale in comparison to this book.  No spoiler here but the last 40 or 50 pages were such that I skimmed through them merely to finish the book, returning to read it more slowly after finding out how the book ended.  I'm not in a book club but this is one that should appeal to all ages and readers.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Great options, TONS of games to choose from, lots of earned upgrades, plus constant game upgrades and additions.  Be careful, it's incredibly addicting!
B004UPANGM|4.0|The combination filming technique and what amounts to either bad acting or base reality sets this up as a comical horror flick. You either love it or hate it. If you love it, then the new film will be disappointing, as they have made it a real horror flick. The people who have embraced it, like me, adore the comedic quality. This will be a cult classic long after the remake has turned to dust.
0525953728|3.0|This book is a good account of the Ben Laden story.  Much of the book is about Seal training which is a rehash of other similar books.  I gave it 3 stars because there was a lot missing relative to the intelligence side of the caper of how they found him, etc.

I know of the horrible things done to animals all over the world. You do NOT have to bring this to the forefront when all I want to do is check the weather. Uninstalling immediately!!!! You ruined a once great app.

B00CKJTOHO|3.0|Loved the show but found out after the purchase that I couldn't watch it on the Apple TV format only the computer and iPad.
B000SEHJGQ|4.0|You feel for the protagonist. He had a rough start and he became quite a character. A likeable underdog. An enjoyable read.
B000FZESY4|5.0|I had only heard Opeth's earlier works before this so I was surprised when I listened to this album. I probably listened to it 3 times through because there's so much depth to this album. \\"Ghost Reveries\\" shows Opeth going in a new direction that is extremely effective. There were times when I could clearly hear Pink Floyd or King Crimson influence.<br /><br />Mikeal, the singer, still growls on this album but not nearly as much as on Opeth's earlier albums. I would say that he predominantly sings clearly over the amazing electric guitar work and sounds amazing. There is still plenty of growling here too though, just not as much as I'm used to from Opeth.<br /><br />There are synths, strings, and organs that give this album an atmosphere that is very gloomy but undeniably intriguing. It also feels like each song is part of a story that comes to a conclusion at the end (not a new concept for the band but it still works really well here).<br /><br />The Deep Purple cover of \\"Soldier of Fortune\\" is a nice addition that is like icing on the cake of the album (even if it's obviously out of place with the other tracks, still amazing).<br /><br />For fans of Opeth, this is definitely a must buy.<br /><br />For people getting into Opeth, get \\"Blackwater Park\\" or \\"Deliverance\\".
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love it. Smart. Fast paced. Acting wonderful with many new pretty faces. Fun to watch how they get around all of the brick walls they encounter. Relationships are very I interesting.
1410430103|5.0|I think I've read all of the Lee Child books and I recently watched the Jack Reacher movie.  However, the story in the movie does not match any of the stories in the books.  Maybe there is an upcoming novel that will take care of that.  If so, it is already on my Amazon Wish List.

B009R659L8|4.0|Mary Higgins Clark is one of my all time favorite authors, and she didn't disappoint in her latest book.  I would highly recommend Daddy's Gone A Hunting for someone looking for a good mystery.

B0001I561E|1.0|Unfortunately the DVD we purchased was scratched at the place of \\"a whole new world.\\" we were not able to hear any part of the song which was the reason we bought this DVD. Very disappointed.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Fans of Khaled Hosseini's work will quickly become immersed in this story and the complicated relationships that cross class and time.  The transitions can be arresting at times but Hosseini quickly connects the dots to bring the reader back on track.  The depth and breadth of these characters add considerable nuance to this harsh tale of life, love, and survival.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I love Stephen King, but I hate it when he ends the story with a cliffhanger as he does with \\"Mile 81.\\"
B009WUBERW|4.0|The movie was good. Action packed lots of gun shooting and one liners that are funny. Word word word word
B00C9U9YLA|5.0|Homme's riffwork is amazing as always, but it seems like this band morphs when he's playing with certain musicians.  The Dave Grohl tracks are particularly attacking, and even though he doesn't appear on this one, the songwriting seems more than a little influenced by John Paul Jones.<br /><br />1  Keep Your Eyes Peeled  5:04 - An uneven but dynamic opener, the most challenging song on the album.<br />2  I Sat By The Ocean  3:55 - This is how adults face break ups.<br />3  The Vampyre Of Time And Memory  3:34 - Bring on the Zepplin Keyboards - Let your past go and move on, which brings us to the best three tracks back to back since the Jesus Lizard's Nub-Seasick-Monkey Trick assault from [[ASIN:B008MIHR4E Goat (Remaster / Reissue) [Explicit] [+digital booklet]]]<br />4  If I Had A Tail  4:55 - Making music his way, fans and sycophants be damned, I've seen some reviewers call this \\"pop\\", but you won't hear this on the radio, I think the term they are looking for is GOOD MUSIC.<br />5  My God Is The Sun  3:55  - Monster Riff, awesome chorus, not a second is wasted on this one<br />6  Kalopsia  4:38 - You think, ah such a letdown, this dumb little ballad folowing that awesome one-two punch, and then I hear something I have heard since 19freakin94 - Trent Reznor screaming his ass off!  The tenderness of Homme's singing mashed up with the scratchy old school Reznor sounding like the pent-up band nerd he used to be not only ROCKS this song, but really makes me look forward to [[ASIN:B00D8HNR2K Hesitation Marks (Deluxe Edition)]]<br />7  Fairweather Friends  3:43 - Cue the Zepplin intro - and check out the coolest collaberation on this album.  Reznor rocks in his roles, but Sir Elton's piano licks sound great paired with Homme's riffs.  All adddition, no detraction.<br />8  Smooth Sailing  4:51  - Queens do disco/funk rock, sorry some people don't get this one, it's a solid groove.<br />9  I Appear Missing  6:00  - Long, building, rumbling, probably the most traditional Queens' song on the album (if such a thing exists)<br />10  ...Like Clockwork  5:24 - The cooldown at the end, a nice accoustic gem, on this album, it seems a bit out of place, but take it out of context and it stands just as strong on it's own.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM!

B000QRIGLC|5.0|As a Vietnam veteran I have spent time on a two way range.  This book brought back memories of the brotherhood I still feel toward my band of brothers from that God forsaken war.  If this book does not bring a tear of pride to your heart then there is nothing that will.
B00DU74U74|1.0|Far too many kissing in the rain scenes for any man to enjoy, tricked by my wife into unremarkable film.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|I have been a huge Justin Timberlake fan since his beginnings with N'Sync. I saw them in concert at the local fairgrounds 16 years ago and have been hooked ever since. I love all of his solo albums, except this one. TO be  fair it is better than 90 percent of the crap out there but that doesn't mean it's good. The best thing I can say about it is that it's \\"just ok\\". I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|It is so nice to be able to rely upon some actors who never fail.  Maggie Smith is certainly one of those.  The other cast members were also delightful.<br /><br />While I note that this film probably  would not appeal to people in their 20's or younger, it is certainly not limited to those in the actors age range.  The filming is beautiful - what else could the English countryside be unless the director ruins it with camera shots that zip, tilt, flash so it ends up looking like someone on speed held the camera.  The quietness of this film is such a relief.  Hold on - it even has dialogue - what a concept!  Using words instead of animation or special effects.<br /><br />All in all a wonderfully done film, enjoyable story line, and one I'm happy to have spent the money on.
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|Although I know that the game was geared more towards younger kids, a majority of the levels were painfully easy to finish in a way that made you think &quot;huh? It can't be THAT east, can it?&quot; However, there were a few levels that made you use your brains, and it's overall very relaxing, without much frustration involved. For that reason, the game is perfect for anyone who enjoys strategy games (think portal) no matter how old you are.
1250029465|5.0|I purchased this book as part of a 2-for special at Tesco, a UK supermarket chain. It sat on my bookshelf until a few weeks ago when a friend I had lunch with mentioned James Bowen and Bob - that motivated me to take it on a recent trip. I finished the book and was very impressed to have learned James' journey since meeting Bob.<br /><br />The story is clearly very personal and provides insights on homelessness, street performers, Big Issue sellers, etc. in London that I had minimal or no familiarity with prior to reading the book. James nor Bob are perfect, but it becomes clear how they really benefited from one another.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book! :)
B000I9U8VO|4.0|If you are a fan of marvel, you will like this movie.  My wife just finished watching to fully understand from watching the new Wolverine movie and she enjoyed it too.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I truly enjoyed watching the whole series.  I had a hard time turning it off.  It really kept my interest all y\the way through.  I am looking forward to the next season.
B0019FWIEQ|4.0|I try to watch all movies I can get my hands on, and while this is not a new release I am glad I came across it. Spacey and Freeman are both excellent actors and the plot makes it a hidden gem. I recommend others view this film!
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Loved the game.  Wish it were longer. Can't wait for the second version.  Wow.  Solving these screens went too fast!
1936594234|5.0|My father bought this book for me when i was going through a very difficult breakup, i was having panic and anxiety attacks and didn't see a point in life. But after i began reading this book everything changed. THIS BOOK SAVED MY LIFE. i didnt want to stop reading it, Joseph murphy makes it easy for you to understand and incorporate his suggestions and ideas in your real life. And if you are truly open and believe you have have the power to turn your life around, then YOU WILL. i sure did, and i had hit rock bottom. I now feel brand new and ready to take charge of my life. Im reading it for the second time and plan on reading it more than twice. Im so thankful this book exists, Joseph Murphy was truly a beautiful being for sharing it with the world.
B00701L5XS|4.0|This is an extremely helpful app that allows folks to learn knots much easier than the traditional methods. The only thing that kept me from giving this application 5 stars is the size of the knot catalog. All the basics are covered, but some of the more common advanced knots such as ABOK #787 (aka Knife Lanyard Knot),  or ABOK # 2496 (aka Portuguese Sinnet). Of course having the entire ABOK (Ashley's Book Of Knots) catalog in the application would be the ultimate. Unfortunately, creating a catalog that large would be a heavy lift.
B001NTGH2C|5.0|This very early album from &#34;Miss Donna&#34; is one of my favorites!!!  Try Me, I Know, We Can Make It..........Try me,  I know we can make it.  These three simple ideas are combined into one entire full length song infused with the incessant disco beat of the time period.  Gorgeous, breathy vocals and timeless instrumental accompaniment are married into a sexy and almost hypnotic mix that just begs for the listener to close his or her eyes and be swept away into an almost dream-like world.  One of her best, your collection is NOT complete without it.  Highly recommended for all her fans and for anyone who enjoys the music of that magical period.  Sit back, &#34;dim all the lights&#34;, and ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This could have been great, but there are sooo many bugs in this that it neither is fun nor would you want to come back to subject yourself to this torture.  It constantly freezes, whether right at the start screen or while you are playing.  The controls are laughably bad.  You will die at least a hundred times before you will ever even get to the halfway point.  No, I am not a horrible player.  I have been playing video games of all stripes for over 20 years, and when you tell your character to go left and it either does nothing or goes the opposite way then the game has a problem.  This game has many problems.  You have been warned.
B0099116AY|5.0|This was a cute funny movie.  If you are over 40 you gotta see this one.  Meryl and Tommie Lee Jones were outstanding and funny.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|The Name of the Wind was a great reading experience. I would strongly recommend this to all out there who likes fantasy.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This Bridges the Gap between my wife's tastes and my tastes perfectly.  We both love it and have trouble not having Abbey-a-thons!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The graphics for this game are outstanding but come at the price of system stability. On my Kindle Fire HD, the game is stable 90% of the time, but will still &#34;stutter&#34; every now and again. On my older original Kindle Fire, the game will only run after restarting the Kindle and stutters a bit more often.<br /><br />The game play is addictive, but without spending real money on Gru coins, you are limited. Additionally, the difficulty of the game ratchets up much quicker than similar games such as Temple Run or Subway Surfers. Overall, I enjoy playing the game, but anticipate my interest dying off as the options for getting free Gru coins wanes.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I wanted more details.  Is Bran going to continue to be a mushroom in a hole in the ground???  And did he try to contact Jon Snow through the crow?  What in the world has happened to Rickon???  Did Sansa get married, again??  Is she giving up her heritage??  What happened when Breanne was hanged?  Why isn't she dead?  Where did she lead Jamie and why?  Did the others that hung with her die??  How many people will come back to life?  Is there a possibility that Lady Lisa will come back to life just as her sister Catelyn did??  And how could Ramsay Snow Bolton be requesting the return of his &#34;wife&#34;, if he killed Stannis, that is where his wife and Reek went to??  Why did Theon become Reek?  And why didn't he spill his guts about not killing off the Stark boys while he was being tortured?  What happened to Samwell?  What happens to Arya?  And is all the vulgar language really needed?  A story can be indepth and well crafted without all the cursing, that is a choice.  Too many unanswered questions for me.  Is Mr. Martin going to drag this out into 100 books?
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is something different but wonderful. I can't wait for the sequel to come out so I can continue the journey with the peculiar children and their Peregrine.

0553386794|2.0|I'd read on FB and twitter about the \\"Red Wedding\\" - enough to make me want to take this book out of the library. About 1/3 of the way through, I was bored.<br /><br />Too many plot lines, too many characters without depth, too many stories I didn't care about. Friends encouraged me to forge forward (maybe the TV series is much better?) and I did- still didn't find this to be particularly compelling or interesting.<br /><br />Maybe the second book is better, but I'm not particularly optimistic.<br /><br />And for those who compare this author to JRR Tolkein - I say no way.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Did have some trouble getting the bluray disc to play in my blu-ray player, but once they got going, we really enjoyed the movies.  I don't care much for all the spin offs that were produced after the originals, but we really like what we call the &#34;real&#34; Star Wars.

0061726834|4.0|I initially came across Delirium because I was looking for another good series based in a dystopian society. I was intrigued by the concept of a society where love is considered a disease. I was also interested to see how such a society functions and what the consequences might be. I definitely enjoyed reading this book.<br /><br />Overview: Delirium follows Lena in a dystopian U.S. where love is considered a disease called amor deliria nervosa. The dangers and symptoms of the disease are even described in the government-issued Book of Shhh (&#34;Safety, Health, and Happiness Handbook&#34;). At age 18, all members of society receive the &#34;cure&#34; and are matched with a career and a marriage partner. The government even dictates how many children the couple will have. Lena is looking forward to the day she will be cured. However, not everyone is as eager. Some individuals choose to resist the cure and would rather die than be without love. As Lena discovers more about the world, however, she realizes there may be more to love than the government lets on.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />1.) I really liked that Oliver included short passages from the Book of Shhh (&#34;Safety, Health, and Happiness Handbook&#34;) as well as passages indicating restricted and forbidden works before the start of each chapter. I.e., at the beginning of chapter 2 appears the following Book of Shhh passage: &#34;We must be constantly on guard against the Disease; the health of our nation, our people, our families, and our minds depends on constant vigilance.&#34; I felt that these passages really helped build the world of Delirium and helped me to visualize the world Lena lives in.<br /><br />2.) I also liked that Lena's reactions were realistic. Some readers might find her somewhat childish in her behaviors, but I think her reactions showed just how much her society indoctrinates its citizens to fear and reject love. In some books, the main character jumps from one extreme belief to theopposite without much in between. I liked Lena because she is torn between two different paths, and I think it made her struggle much more relatable.<br /><br />3.) The &#34;Invalids,&#34; people who have resisted the cure and have escaped from society to settle outside of the society's walls, were also a great addition to the story. The duality between the two groups really helped reveal the internal conflicts between the desire for love and the dangers of love.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />1.) Although I really liked how the story played out, I felt that some aspect of the world was missing that kept me from becoming completely immersed in the story. I think this may be because Lena spent a lot of time contemplating what she would do rather than revealing it through her actions and interactions with other people.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the world that Oliver creates. The story reminded me a lot of the Matched trilogy by Allie Condie, and I think fans of Matched would enjoy this book. I look forward to reading the other two books in the Delirium series to see where the story goes. However, I decided to give Delirium 4 stars instead of 5 stars because I felt, as I mentioned above, that I couldn't get lost in the story as easily as I can with some of my favorite books.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Don't be creepy. Don't be creepy. Don't be creepy. What young man, zombie or non, hasn't had a similar thought when trying to woo a young lady? Funny, sweet and a simply fantastic movie. Not gory, not really scary but it's not some lightweight, wannabe zombie version of Twilight, either. It also has one of the best soundtracks and scores I've heard. I might buy the score but what I want is the soundtrack and I can't find it any where not even here. Feist, Roy Orbison, Bon Iver, c'mon, doesn't that sound appealing?
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|movie was wonderful, beautiful scoring and settings jumped out. Story was a tear jerker and my girlfriends and I watch it over and over and still cry as we sing every word of the songs.
0670014893|4.0|The fiction as truth and the non-fiction as lie. LeCarre has in this novel perfectly explained Edward Snowden's position. Toby Bell in the novel, a reluctant whistleblower who has not planned very well, underestimating the evil that will be unleashed against him is an example of why Snowden did it and ran and so far has been successful. If you have read LeCarre before then you know he has his pen on the pulse of the present world as it is unfolding. It is a truly frightening world. As Virlilio has warned us, the thugs are in control and are teamed up with the government, and his view is desperately pessimistic as is LeCarre's. To argue about the characterization of the Americans in this novel, why, just watch and listen to the Obama administration on Snowden. Doesn't appear LeCarre exaggerated.
B00377V6J2|5.0|A pure joy to see and hear.....we are lucky to have this performance for the ages.<br />Just sit back, tune the world out and enjoy a masterpiece
B0026O475M|4.0|He's awesome! He's Tom Hanks! He's on an island! He's peeing into the ocean. He'd rather be humping Helen Hunt!
B002MGGM9I|1.0|Although I really enjoy seeing Jake Gyllenhaal as a young actor, it could not make up for the complete insanity of this movie.  I never knew what I was watching and my head hurt by the end of the movie from confusion.  I like movies for entertainment, not for thinking until it feels like my brain will burst.  Maybe for a much more educated (or maybe psychotic) person than myself.  Definitely would not recommend this movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy was addictive, in a good way!  I was a little disappointed initially when E.L. James seemed to skip over the wedding, but as I read I realized she covered it well enough.  The sex in all three books left me basically thinking two things:  1.  The submissive parts/physically painful parts for me, not withstanding, I felt the character of C. Greys \\"experience\\" in seducing, the kind of, location of, and HOW he touched Anna, speaking during sex were SO good and so \\"spot on hot for women\\" (at least this one!) I think it should be a \\"must read\\" for all men over 28 years old!!!  WOW!<br />On the flip side, the character Anna, had UNREALISTIC physical responses even with a partner and sexpert, esp. with her almost non-existent  sexual background.  Sorry, but it takes women a longer time, and a very good understanding of how your body works, etc. to have \\"the heavens explode open in Technicolor , repeatedly, EVERY SINGLE TIME\\"  Even then, NOT atypical of your \\"average\\" women, THAT MANY times a day, that many times in a row as well!  I get this was fairy tail in many areas and it doesn't make for a \\"good read\\" if she was \\"normal\\".<br />The other redundancy I was getting annoyed with was her \\"innocent blushing\\" esp. around Christain!  Come ON ALREADY!  If you do what she does with a man, then her husband, Kiddo, you don't blush if he is in the restroom when you tinkle!  Those are my criticisms, but I loved these books, and I am almost embarrassed  to admit it!  I was sorry when I read them all.  Felt like I had nothing to do with my free time when I had finished them!
B001NLL93W|5.0|If I could, I would give this a hundred stars! This is one of the best series you'll ever read! Thank you Cassandra Clare!!

B00B5HQL50|5.0|Wonderful film, best one of these I have seen in a while.  Mr. Craig is very believable as 007.<br />We purchased it on Amazon Prime.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I got into the book and past the inevitable introduction chapters, I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!  I found myself, while sitting alone, speaking out loud at some points,  \\"Holy...!!!\\"  LOL!  This book is FAR FAR less about sadomasochistic acts then the public, including myself, believed.  It is really NOT about graphic S &M at all.<br />Could not put it down!  When I finished, I was so glad I had two whole books left to continue the journey!  I do feel slightly embarrassed I enjoyed them so much, but I can honestly say it was not JUST because of the sex.  It was the journey.  Well done E.L. James!  P.S.  I should have included this in my review of book three, but, I have MANY VALID questions, and, as do others I have talked to who read the books, and reasons why I think this will not transfer well to the big screen.  I see a movie a potential for a huge failure!  From picking the actors, to needing it to be graphic enough (No way a standard R rating is going to cut it and sex is very important to the essence of the book) to the fact so much of the book is just Anna's thoughts, nonverbal.  This has the potential to disappoint MANY fans I fear.  Perhaps if an \\"X\\" rating was still used or at least the old R-NC 17 thing. Then, finding a man that women UNIVERSALLY think is as HOT as Christain Greys character is repeatedly described as almost \\"perfect\\" looking with a body to match will be very tricky.  Anna not as difficult, but still a challenge.  Some man with LITERALLY beautiful bone structure, five o'clock shadow, tall, muscular, almost a pretty boy in the face, universally appealing?  TOUGH ONE!  I hope they come even relatively close to doing the book(s) justice!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Love the show!  It is addicting, however, I hate the buffering which is usually three or four times per show.
B00AEFXJ86|4.0|Great example of PTSD. Appreciated how the movie gave the perspective of a sexually abused child and how it negatively affected her whole life but with nurturing and care she was able to begin the road to recovery.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Easy to use, really helps me wind down and sleep more sound at night. I recommend this app to everyone.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I am really enjoying this game app.  For a horse lover you will notice all the subtle inflections of natural horse movements which I find to be a real treat. There is a lot to do to keep yourself busy and the ability to earn free gems is nice as well.  I gave four instead of five stars as I encountered a few crashes with this app that forced me to hard reboot but otherwise it is a solid app.<br /><br />Edit: I changed my rating to 2 stars, after buying some gems, they claim they will remove the incredibly annoying advertising that pops up at randomly increasing intervals, no consistency at all.  Hell, sometimes you get ads popping one on top of the other completely disrupting the game. Really terrible.  When the advertising did not cease after the gem purchase, despite the gems being credited to my game, I contacted support.  They told me to screenshot my purchase.  Really?  I have to go find my purchase and screenshot it for gems that are clearly already credited to my account?  Talk about lazy and perhaps poor bookkeeping as well.  I guess you as the customer are expected to do their job for them to get any results.  I decided to stop using it if the publisher is that damn lazy.  I am sure for those who never intend on supporting the product by buying gems, it will serve you just fine.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I'm not a Cruise fan but Lee Child writes a great story.  It was a surprise to see him pull the Reacher character.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The ending starting at the beginning, I assume was for the reader to see how far Christain Grey had come?  Funny because in book one, I found that part of the book rather \\"boring\\" and although it gave you a completely different perspective,  I believe there could have been a multitude of satisfying endings.  I do not know how E.L. James could take the trilogy farther at the end of book 3, although, I did not want the trilogy to end! I was very glad it did not have a sad, devastating ending, and I hope if she embarks on a book 4, she will keep the couple together, perhaps to weather more storms, but apart, I would be very disappointed and would stop following her work on these particular books.
B008GJVH7M|5.0|Worth every minute!  Riveting!<br /><br />I've been wanting to see this movie since it came out... it was worth the wait!
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|When I got up to level six and visited a friend and came bake home the game had rearranged my farm and the daily bounis thing kept on piping up
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love Downton Abbey and Season 3 was unbelievable - not as predictable as one might think either.<br /><br />I loved it and can't believe we have to wait until January 2014 for the next season!
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I use silicone plugs in my ears when I swim. I have tried other waterproof earphones before and they still let water in so I couldnt wear them. I was concerned that the sound quality wouldnt be very good with the neptune due to my plugs, but it sounds great!! I'm so happy I have these. I'm knocking out an hour of laps without even realizing it now; highly recommend.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Well it started a little slow for me but got to speed.  The story is a very old one but there were enough turns to keep it interesting.  Excellent graphics and it was fun trying to guess the giants characters from their voices.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I loved the 'language' of these stories! The accents, fashions and emotions all come to life! Can's wait for another in Parasol Protectorate story!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game cause it kind of shares part of despicable  me 2 that is what I like about the game
B000ICZD4I|4.0|Excellent acting, known actors, clever storyline.... very entertaining!  Made me want to go out and try some &#34;fried green tomatoes!!&#34;
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|i felt like i was part of the movie.<br />the actors are were great.<br />the costumes were amazing.<br />i love it.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I was very happy to see Bubble Witch Saga become available on my Kindle.  It is so easy to play in the early levels....... and, a LOT of fun as it becomes more challenging.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|You will love this film or be completely confused by it.  Just keep an open mind and enjoy it.<br />There were so many wonderful actors in this wonderful film.<br />I loved it.
B00AF46Q5Y|5.0|The characters never missed a bat as we grew up right along with them.  Could not skip any pages to get to  the end as each heroes' story complimented the other's to create a wonderful 1-2 punch of a book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So much creativity in the ideas an  power-ups. I'm in love with it. To me it's a bit like temple run, but (in my option) it's a bit better!
B0087ZG7HK|4.0|I received the DVD in good condition, the packaging was in good condition and there were no scratches on the DVD itself.  Thank You.
B00DURILJ2|1.0|I did not like the language spoken by the young boys.  Overall, it was a depressing movie.  The story plot was not good.<br />It just was not the type movie I like to see/
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This is a great game for anyone looking for a game to pass alot of time. Infinite combinations to try out. Careers are great. Game is also great for those who live for logistics!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|That's what this is all about.  Wonderful period story, more of a docudrama of that time in history.<br />Great performance by Day-Lewis and Sally Fields.  I guess if you had to wrap it up in a few words it would be,<br />politics as usual.<br />The three branches of government haven't change much over the years.
B00E193TM2|5.0|i love Five Finger Death Punch and i was a little disappointed with their previous American Capitalist album however i just downloaded this one and all i can say is wow im really impressed and excited with this new album. My recommendation is if you like this band get this album.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Cast did an excellent job of showing passion and juicy living is available at any age!<br /><br />Dustin 2 thumbs up for your directing.
0545586178|5.0|My husband wanted this book after reading Hunger Games. I don't think he put it down once he started! Now he wants the next one!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|If you are already a fan of Downton Abbey then you will enjoy the continuing saga of the Grantham family. They are learning to break tradition and accept the new dynamics and changes of a new world. You will not be disappointed...perhaps only by the very surprising twists that you will NEVER expect.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|A very cleverly written thought provoking read, one I guarantee any reader will be unable to put down.  Although the material may be upsetting to some, it is handled in a very sensitive manner.
B00005U122|5.0|This concert is great, the audio quality superb, and it's the only available DVD I have found which includes videos used in the background, stage props etc I saw during the 2007 tour in B.C. Overall very good to watch & listen to I look forward to finding HD footage or disc in the future with the tour I saw them on.
B000N5F6OW|5.0|This is the most fun that you will see John Wayne have in a movie. The energy between the actors gives the movie great appeal.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Watched all seasons available, great series. I'm hooked cant wait for my next fix, lol. Hope the wait isn't too long : (
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Great movie! Very original. This is one of the only movies that has truly left an impression on me throughout the years.
140006922X|5.0|Interesting insight into a historic figure more researched than almost any other in history. Aslan is a remarkable author who's education and background help him bring forward a refreshing take on a well worn topic. Bravo!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely recommend this series - fun to watch!  Can't wait for season 4.  Insight into how people think and how tradition affects our lives.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Almost watched the whole season in one sitting. If you like British Drama then this is a series for you.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars was an amazing read. This coming from a 13 year old. I found the story to be complex and interesting and downright amazing. The relationship between Hazel and Augustus made my heart melt. Two star-crossed lovers bound together by cancer, love, and books. Definitely my favourite book.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett continues to enlighten me about a time period I thought I knew in the most enjoyable way.  My only negative bout this book would be too many details of WW11.  Great read. Not always a page turner.  Jacque
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This was an amazing book and I can't stop reading it I couldn't put it down its the perfect mix of romance and its almost like in getting a tour of Paris
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Red was okay. The trailers made it look more slap-stick than it really is because they used most of the one liners. Good performances all around. Malkovich was hilarious.
B00785P2QC|5.0|love it its super fun and easy to play I would recommend it to any one 5 out of 5 stars all the way : )
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS GAME IS TOTALLY FUN. I LOVE THE CHALLENGES AND GAMEPLAY ITSELF. I RECOMMEND ANYONE WHO IS A FAN OF THE MINIONS TO PLAY THIS GAME.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is the most challenging game I have played. I could not stop until I solved all of the floors. Can't wait for next round of floors.
B0070Z4M4I|4.0|It was very suspenseful and somewhat believable.  The movie had likable characters and it was worth renting. We enjoyed it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My son loves to play this game. It is easy and very entertaining. He could spend hours playing this game.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a really incredible book.  I just finished reading it to my children (ages 10, 9, and 6 year old twins) I would recommend that all parents not only read but actually discuss this book with your kids.  It's teaches kindness, empathy and friendship among many other things.  The world would be a better place if all kids were exposed to this book and were taught to be a \\"Summer\\" and not a \\"Julian.\\"
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have to admit, I had my own idea and hope who Sookie would end up with but I enjoyed all of these books.  Besides Sookie has her own mind and will be with her own choosing.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is an interesting thinking game , im bearly the 6th level and rated it 5 stars its great for killing time i hope everyone download it
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|One of the staples of every Beatles collection.  Glad it's finally on bluray!  It's good to see them young and in HD.
1609613937|2.0|This diet needs someone to develop recipes that taste good. It certainly will help you with weight loss because the weight just falls off.<br /><br />I am not a believer in all of the research. Some is doubtful in mine and worried me enough not to continue with the program.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly was an awesome show. Great story line. Wish they would bring it back.  They want six more words before they will allow me to submit.
B000X4GXT0|5.0|This movie is one I can watch again and again. Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting are the best Romeo and Juliet ever. Their innocence and passion ooze off the screen. Olivia's portrayal of Juliet is captivating. Leonard's eyes when they first meet melt my heart.
1932735410|5.0|I just passed the PMP exam last week, on my first attempt too!  This was the primary book that I used for preparation.  I am sure I passed thanks in much to this book.  The tricks and exercises provided in the book are worth a great deal (especially Rita's process chart).<br />The reading material itself is very wordy and long and tends to become disengaging to the reader.  Unfortunately, that is the nature of what you need to know for the exam, so just keep up!<br /><br />In regards to other study material, yes you should review the PMBOK itself as well.  I just skimmed the chapters that were provided in the \\"cheat card\\" provided in this book.  Also, take plenty of practice exams in advance!  Don't bother with the PM Fast Track that is associated with this book.  Only a demo is provided with the book and the full-version costs 300 dollars.  Just search online for \\"Free PMP Practice Questions\\" and you will find enough links and material to get yourself ready.<br /><br />I realize this review is coming late for this edition, since as of today PMI started administering the new PMP exam based off PMBOK 5th edition.  But I hope my words will entice you to consider [[ASIN:1932735658 PMP Exam Prep, Eighth Edition: Rita's Course in a Book for Passing the PMP Exam]].  Good luck on the PMP exam!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My first series on my new Kindle and it really held me.  Can't wait for the next season on television.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|As a 90's kid, I was a huge fan of Backstreet Boys and use to love all their albums. But in my opinion, some of their recent albums like \\"This is Us\\" and \\"Unbreakable\\" just haven't been some of their best work. With all 5 guys back on this album, however, I really feel like they're ready for a comeback. Although this album has some new sound that I wasn't use to hearing from them, I absolutely loved it. There are a lot of acoustic songs on this album, which is an unexpected surprise. This album is nothing like their old albums, but I think old fans will be pleasantly surprised by what their hear and new fans will learn to fall in love this 'boy band'.<br /><br />1. In a World Like This (5/5) - The first single off their new album, and once I heard it I was completely won over. Catchy and upbeat.<br /><br />2. Permanent Stain (5/5) - My favorite parts are the harmonies that come in sporadically and the catchy chorus.<br /><br />3. Breathe (5/5) - The slowest song on the album with some of my favorite lyrics from the selection.<br /><br />4. Madeleine (5/5) - A nice acoustic song accompanied by just a guitar! This is something that Backstreet Boys aren't really known for, but I really loved the simplicity of the song. It's a happy song that really showcases everybody's voices.<br /><br />5 Show 'Em (What You're Made of) (3/5) - Didn't really stand out to me too much, but nothing terrible..<br /><br />6. Make Believe (3/5) - Also nothing too standout-ish. This one is more on the bland side for me.<br /><br />7. Try (5/5) - Another acoustic song with a nice beat. It's simple and beautiful, and while the song features mostly Howie(?), I love the harmonic parts.<br /><br />8. Trust Me (4/5) - The song starts out with a little guitar, and gets more upbeat as the song progresses. It's smooth and simple.<br /><br />9. Love Somebody (4/5) - One of the more upbeat songs on the album. While the songs begins slow, it eventually gets more techno towards the chorus. I like it for the way it combines their old sound with their new sound.<br /><br />10. One Phone Call (3/5) - Although a great song, the rest of the album is so great I don't think this one stands out too much.<br /><br />11. Feels Like Home (3/5) - It sounds to me like this song starts off with a bit of country sound, but ends up with the pop sound that we're use to hearing. The end is my favorite with its strong beats and upbeat tempo.<br /><br />12. Soldier (4/5) - This might be the closest to some of their old songs, with a little bit of ballad parts mixed with an upbeat chorus. The lyrics are also one of the betters ones on the album.<br /><br />All in all, I've really loving the new acoustic sounds for the guys!the way it combines their old sound with their new sound.<br /><br />10.

B008HK3XOU|4.0|Cover provides good protection and is not bulky. Does fit in almost any purse for travel. However, it sometimes slips when used to prop the Kindle.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|It is nice to be able to review footage immediately after recording to know just how good or how bad it came out. Makes fine tuning placement and angles less of a guessing game. It does drastically reduce battery life so I recommend turning the screen off once you have your shot lined up.
161655164X|4.0|I like it a lot, but I miss some explanations about it and some writing about those concepts. But still very good..
B002GYS1FO|4.0|Not my favorite style of music, but I like the theme song from Strike Force. Actually, there are several cuts that I recognize and do enjoy. Overall, a great addition to my collection.
B003U53GK8|5.0|The entire series was entertaining and addicting.  But, it left me wondering about some of the twists which were never cleared up at the end.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|So nice to have a funny film that isn't slapping you in the face with the jokes. I love it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I owned 2 out of the 3 Movies but, they were on regular DVD Disc.<br />Purchased this Set, so I'd have them in Blu-Ray Disc!!
B008JEJN8O|5.0|I wanted to purchase this pair of shoes for my husband during the Crocs sale but the site went out of stock. I came to Amazon and found out that here is actually cheaper than the Crocs' site! I purchased this pair and they fit perfectly. My husband's feet are wider than normal. He hasn't worn them yet but he loves them being so fit. He had another classic crocs for a couple years but the bottom of the shoes has lost their traction.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|The movie gives visual faces and places to the words in the book. I was glad they made the movie to enlighten the younger generation of what has been in our culture for a long time and still survives when it comes to inequality among people. Wake up, humanity, we are ONE!
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|In general, I think this is an okay movie.  I 100% agree with all of the comments about it getting away from the main theme or purpose of Star Trek.  As a movie, without considering the purpose of Star Trek, its very action packed and getting moving on very quickly without time to really reflect upon what happened.  This all comes down to JJ Abrams style.  You can clearly see this in his other movies and TV shows; he is about action not reflection (the opposite of the original purpose of Star Trek).<br /><br />As a director JJ Abrams is like someone that was told verbally what Star Trek was like, but had never seen the show and didn't bother to read the Wikipedia page before jumping right in and it is clear in the movie that it just doesn't really fit well into the Star Trek universe.<br /><br />The acting is fine, but some things just don't make any sense.  Why would a star ship with transports, shuttles, the works, need to \\"hide\\" itself in an ocean so primitive natives cant see the ship?  Why not just stay in orbit...<br /><br />Bottom line, it was okay.  It moved way too fast for my preference and I just couldn't get over some of the inconsistencies with other Star Trek films and shows.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Started watching this after running out of Dowton Abbey episodes. Found myself watching way too much to find out what happens next.  Very addicting and am looking forward to the next season on television.
B001JI72AI|5.0|I'm not a big movie-goer so had never seen this before.  I got it after visiting the rocket center museum in Huntsville, AL.  It was the perfect companion to the trip.  I was an adolescent during this mission and since watching the movie can't figure out how i missed knowing all of this before.  The cast does a superb job conveying the intensity and danger the astronauts experienced,  the committed team work at mission control, and dedication of their families.  If you're not sure this movie is your type...take a chance and try it, i bet it'll hold your attention.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so fun! I seriously cannot stop playing. I'm a full blown addict. The collections are difficult to complete, so it helps to have lots of friends.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|This app contain many options to know about our share values in the market. it also gives the information about the news also.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I thought I wanted to start watching this series when it began, but let the weeks go by and got way behind. Now, that I have Amazon Video Prime and can start at the beginning of Season 1 and watch as many episodes as time allows, I am up to Season 1 Episode 19. It is a fascinating, engaging, exciting, current material, realistic, full of surprises, great acting, wonderful guest actors, and just an all around tasteful and addictive series. For me, it is an adult series that I can watch and feel comfortable with its storyline. It appeals to me as an adult without excess sex, violence, drug addition, etc.
B001DHXT20|4.0|My son has a great movie collection, but for some crazy reason, we had bad luck in finding \\"The INCREDIBLE HULK\\"... so for his birthday we went to Amazon, and as usual, we found what we needed, we received it on time and in good condition.  Thank you
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This movie was the very first one I saw on my tablet.  So good and worth while viewing.  Try it.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Iery powerful series..the cast are superb in their roles...it's historically on the money..with a flare! On the third season and give it two thumbs up!
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|This movie was very long and very slow.  The last 1/2 hour was probably the best, but by that time we were doing laps around the living room to keep ourselves awake.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone.<br />The controls are easy to master and the game kills time.<br />This game is absolutely amazing.<br />=D
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Looks like Tom Cruise may have another multi-sequel opportunity with Jack Reacher. It was entertaining, some violence, but not overdone. In my opinion, Jack Reacher is a more suitable role for him. He acts like a grown-up and does it well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very stimulating! A great way to pass the time. Love it a lot. Cant wait for more. Great great great great!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I loved this book.  In fact, I couldn't put it down.  It is a really fun read.  Pure escapism at its best.
B0052SNP1G|5.0|There have been precious few albums that affect me on such a level. Giancarlo Erra and Tim Bowness have crafted an intricate masterpiece built upon heartache, loss, nostalgia, and...hope. Completely unsung and underrated album. If you're even a casual fan of No-Man, not only will you not be disappointed, you'll rank it up with the best in that catalog too.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I thought the story was ok, but the acting and dialogue made me cringe. I don't recommend this flick to anyone
1878424319|5.0|This book was referred to me by a good friend & I'm glad she advised me to read it...This was money well spent!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I've read it before, seen the movie, wanted it on Kindle too.  I re-read it often.  Even if you saw the movie, read the book.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|On page 3 the heroine had green eyes.  On page 35 she had blue eyes!  Terrible editing!  Don't waste your time.
B006MGDVIY|5.0|Senna's boyish new world naivete and religious faith define his character.  Soulful and speedy, he apparently melded his ultimate flow on the racecourse with visions of God.  The intimate footage, especially at the start of his last race, is amazing and revealing -- almost as if he accepts his fate.  One comes away from the film with the feeling that his was a Christ-like sacrifice, entered into with full self-knowledge.  This film has great pace and sensitive editing.  It moves like a rocket -- or a F1 machine.
B00005JKG9|5.0|wonderful cast, great topic, real estate sales and what a dog eat dog industry it is.<br /><br />quite a few veteran actors in the movie who gave an outstanding performance.  a real classic.<br /><br />Quick delivery and good packaging.<br />Thank you!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I will be referring to this for a long time to come. There are great perspectives and quotes to come back to when I'm in a funk.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|At the start I was a little bored, but then romance and adventure shot up and I could not and would not put the book down. The end of this book really really sucked, wish I could have slapped Valentine for the lie he was spilling for torment on Clary & Jace. Ultimate love fantasy.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|The controls and touch features are horrible,  sometimes I couldn't even press what I wanted to.  At times,  the instructions were ambiguous at best.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is good but it would be much better if it had some more weapons. With the options it has now it gets boring.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Fellowes seems sadistic in his closure of this series,  There must be a better way to deal with a lead character who wants to leave.  May be my fault for getting too emotionally involved in a happy, stable situation.  Have mixed feelings as to whether or not I will continue if there is a fourth series.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Classic Lee Child!  The only problem with this book is that it ends.  We need more books from Lee Child and more authors like him too!
B008Y5UADK|5.0|Pi, directed by Darren Aronofsky is an intense film about a man who battles his own genius. True to Aronofsky films, the theme of the movie is based on man or woman's struggle to keep their mind in check, and try to stay grounded in reality. Pi is filmed in black and white which adds a gritty, dirty, edge to the film. If you enjoyed watching other Aronofsky films such as &#34;Black Swan,&#34; or &#34;The Wrestler,&#34; you will see Aronofsky's earlier work coming together to become one of the great contemporary directors,
B001NLKZUA|3.0|Jace & Clary be driving me nuts, Valentine I could have killed, and Simon I hope to smack for not thinking right.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Non-stop fun. Cline really sucks you into his world and makes you never want to leave. The only bad thing about the book is that it ends. One of the best books ever written in its genre.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|AWESOME app so I love the app the and other td apps but there are lots of new things like a lab
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We enjoyed this series very much.  The author pulls us through many trials and suspenseful moments, with some frustrating situations much like a Hollywood soap, but basically the drama keeps us coming back for more.  Much better than we seem capable of in the US.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie with my family.  It was packed with action and surprises. The cast was awesome!!! I plan to add this one to my library.
B00633W614|5.0|Have always been drawn to historical novels (Michener, Follett, Rutherfurd) and picked this one up for the same reason.  Not quite as historical as the others, but a really intricate and absorbing story.  Took only a couple of days to read 'Sins of the Father' and upon completion, I immediately ordered 'Only Time Will Tell', which is the faithful sequel.<br />The author is a Brit.  He uses colloquialisms that are familiar to him, but we Yanks are very dependent upon the dictionary to follow his story.  Well worth that extra effort.<br />As a Brit, he illustrates the English class consciousness in a manner that makes it almost understandable to us Americans.  Fun.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Jace I could slap for yelling and lying to Clary. Sebastian I could kill you for what you did to the Lightwoods. The ending couldn't be more perfect.
0316098337|5.0|This is a great book that I didn't want to put down. There is a reason it is a prize winner.
