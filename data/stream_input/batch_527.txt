B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie is a dream come true.  Frank Miller has been my favorite author since 1989's The Dark Knight Returns.  This movie brings his world to life perfectly.  This movie is a collection of short stories which take place in Basin City, which has earned the nick name Sin City.  If you are not familiar with Frank Miller's works, this movie will be quite different than any movie you have seen before because this movie was done with the intent of perserving Frank's style and this was done beautifully!  Frank's style is basically the natural progression of film noir.  For those of you not familiar with noir, imagine the old detective movies where a down on his luck detective is visited by a hotter than hot dame who sets him up on a case that will most likely get him killed and you'll start to get the idea.  Dictionary.com defines noir as \\"A genre of crime literature featuring tough, cynical characters and bleak settings.\\"  With that in mind, I would define Frank's style as Super Noir and it is a beautiful thing.

B000AMJG4Y|2.0|First, it goes almost without saying that this film will only make ANY sense whatsoever if you are familiar with the FFVII game. On it's own it would warrant about 2 stars for absolutely stunning visuals and fast-paced matrix-style action sequences, and this just might maintain a casual observers attention to the end. <br /> <br />The majority of the audience will, however, be to some degree familiar with the FFVII game, some only vaguely and others who could practically describe and analyse every part of it (I fall closer to the latter). This movie only assumes the prior. In fact, it is probably more satisfying if you only know the game superficially, since the game leaves open numerous interesting questions for the actively curious player, none of which are adequately resolved in this movie (which is not to say that Square-Enix hasn't resolved any questions, just that it is done in a disgustingly poor manner). Further, any FFVII fan who doesn't have epileptic fits in response to the flood of stylish action scenes (stylish but also often confusing and ridiculously implausible) will probably notice that an unacceptable portion of the scanty story is out of tune with the game, and some parts even contradict parts of the game. For example (SPOILERS AHEAD) there are two characters who have been inexplicably resurrected for the movie (tseng and rufus), although an attempt is made to explain Rufus along the lines of \\"oh, by the way, i survived (a powerful explosion)\\", Barret apparently spends his time searching for and discovering oil (way to save the planet, man!), and one could even be forgiven for asking whether we are supposed to believe this person called Cloud in the movie is actually the same Cloud from the game. Why does this Cloud seem so ignorant about Jenova? Why has this Cloud reverted back to being so cold and unsure of himself (and no, it's not because he feels he failed Aeris, since that is part of what he overcomes in the game). Since the movie in isolation has almost zero charcter development (or for that matter, much character TO develop) and relies solely for any meaning on what knowledge the audience brings from FFVII the game, I find such tensions between the two to be a serious flaw in Advent Children. <br /> <br />As if such inconsistencies weren't bad enough, many parts of the story are simply nonsensical and/or too conveniently vague. Who exactly are these three bad guys and what sets them apart from other people with \\"geostigma\\"? Apparently that doesn't matter as much as the fact that they make for some nice fighting scenes. Why is any of this happening at all? It's, like, an inevitable eternal recurrence, duh! How do the majority (5) of the characters relate to the story? Well, they don't really, they literally just drop out of the sky and say about 12 words each (think I'm exaggerating? I'm not). How is it that jenovas genes/thoughts (?) in people seem to be strengthened or removed by drinking or splashing in some water (this one particularly baffled me)?! <br /> <br />My opinion is that this should have remained a short film like originally planned. Instead I fear that commercial interests have stretched it's length 5 times over without adding any substance, and probably compromising whatever substance it may have had. This deserves 2 stars, whether you've played the game or not.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I am almost positive that most people who come on Amazon.com and write reviews about how a band is not a \\"sell out\\" don't even know what it means to be a \\"sell out\\" (not that there is such a thing as a sell out in the first place).  Most people call bands \\"sell outs\\" because they think it will make them sound like deep, intelligent beings who really have a command on politics in the music industry. So stop saying Green Day is a sell out just to make yourself sound intelligent. The songs American Idiot, Holiday, and Boulevard of Broken Dreams are on MTV quite a bit and it's not because the band is a sell out...it's because those are GREAT SONGS. Sure Green Day is making probably one of their biggest profits on this album, but they deserve it because the music is so innovative and on another level, very catchy.  Even though I like the Dookie album a little bit better it's still not to totally outshine the creativity and musical accomplishment that can be found on many of the songs on this album. I listen to music because it sounds good...not because I think it's a non sell out band that is probably not eating well and composing and recording new indie albums in a school gymnasium. It does not make you original to like music because it's indie or not many people know about it. You should like music for what it is. American Idiot by Green Day is great music and I hope they continue to make tight albums like this in the future. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE!

Bruce Lipton offers a powerful and persuasive argument, offered in an easily readable style, which slams the door on the Newtonian paradigm of reality and helps usher us into the infinitely more powerful, exciting and helpful realm of epigenetics as a primary determinant of human health.  Like any pioneer, he has been and will be villified by those whose mindset is governed by the health care establishment's fear of either professional or finanical loss, should Lipton's philosophy become widely accepted.  I certainly hope it will be!  I, for one, have already incorporated many of his espoused principles into my own practice and life, with measurable, positive results.  If you read his book with an open mind, you will also come away with something of true value.

0399241515|5.0|Scorpia       PHILOMEL BOOKS <br />By Anthony Horowitz     2004 <br />        112p <br />        $17.99 <br />        ISBN 0-39924151-5 <br /> <br />Scorpia <br />By Anthony Horowitz <br /> <br /> Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a teenage spy? If you have, then this is the book for you! Scorpia is the last book in the Alex Rider Adventure series by Anthony Horowitz.  Alex Rider is a 14 year old boy who never knew his father.  His uncle, John Rider, who worked for MI6, told him that his father died in a plane crash. All Alex had been training to be a spy he just didn't no it yet.  One day, Alex's uncle dies while on a mission and Alex is contacted by MI6. MI6 is a British intelligent agency.  Soon after, Alex is sent on a number of missions by MI6.In Scorpia; Alex is contacted by an organization named Scorpia.  Scorpia is an organization dedicated to the training of assassins.  Alex is convinced to join this organization.  He is sent to a school for assassins where he trains for missions, one of which is the main plot of the book.   Scorpia is a very well written book because Anthony Horowitz describes what is happening very well, and pays attention to details. In the middle, it gives information about Alex's background so that if you have not read the other books you will understand what is happening.  It is so exciting in the beginning that I wanted to keep reading because of the suspense.  Anthony Horowitz is one of my favorite writers because he writes really action packed books and the Alex Rider Adventures are my favorite series because they all connect to each other.  If you like action and adventure, you should read this book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />         Sam Silverstein
B00023B1LC|3.0|While Robert Ludlum's book was the real fast-paced page turner, the movie lacked the suspense and the tension depicted in the book. Ludlum's perfect spy wasn't portrayed well enough.

All-in-all, it's better than the recording off the TV I made on an old VHS...
B000AL730O|5.0|Since the days of the Beatles, the writer of such classics as Yesterday, Michelle, And I Love Her, and so many others has always had to compete with his own catalog of inspired tunes.  As A solo artist and with his group Wings, McCartney had to overcome expectations that everything he wrote would be as great as the Beatles, an impossible burden, even for the ex-Beatle himself.  All the Beatles managed to have successful solo careers, but expectations for John and Paul of course were the highest, since they were considered by many to be our greatest songwriters.  With John  and George now gone, the Beatle mantle falls squarely upon Paul's shoulders.   <br /> <br />Paul's solo career has had its share of high and lows.  A songwriter with a gift of seemingly effortlessly proliferating musical ideas, this is McCartney's 20thstudio album since the Beatles, and this doesn't count other albums, such as his forays into classical music or covers of classic rock songs.   <br /> <br />Paul's ear for arrangements, his wonderful gift of melody and his buoyant spirit have often helped him produce works of pure pop genius. Yet those same strengths could sometimes be liabilities.  He has had a tendency either towards over-production, or under-production, often releasing half-finished tunes.  His penchant to put on his \\"brave face\\" has caused him to be a little too glib and superficial in his lyrics. <br /> <br />Paul's best album is generally thought to be Band On the Run, which was received well by critics and fans alike.  But the quality of many of his other albums has been spotty, with almost every album containing a certain number of clunkers and misfires.  Some albums, like Press to Play or McCartney II, are notable for having almost no songs one can remember (even McCartney recently said he couldn't remember the tunes from Press to Play). <br />   <br />The tendency towards \\"silly love songs\\", a certain lack of depth in many of his lyrics, combined with the spottiness of hisoutput, has meant that Paul has not always been well-received by critics.  Some of that criticism was undoubtedly justified, but some may have also been a result of negative comparison to his former writing partner, John Lennon.  Judging from posy-Beatles material, some surmised that it had been John who was the true artist, while Paul was just a kind of entertainer.  This characterization is unfair, and I talk about it at some length in a review of this album that appears on my blog [...] <br /> <br />While it's true that neither in his writing nor in interviews does Paul come across as a deep intellectual, yet there is a genius in his writing, an instinctive way with the sounds of words, a cleverness with phrases, and at his best, he has produced imaginative lyrics that have matched the originality of his interesting melodies.  <br /> <br />He is often compared with Brian Wilson, but Paul's solo music is more accessible and memorable than the solo work of Mr. Wilson.  Paul is hands down the best melody maker in the history of pop.  Yet as noted, his solo career has been marked by inconsistent efforts. <br /> <br />But on Chaos and Creation, working with a fresh producer, Nigel Godrich (Radiohead, Beck), Paul has managed to rein in some of his negative tendencies.  The lyrics are more mature and reflective.  The spare, tasteful musical arrangements complement the thoughtful quality of the words perfectly.  Apparently Godwin persuaded Paul to leave out his band and record almost all the parts himself (something Paul has done before but not since McCartney I and II). The result is an album that feels \\"organic\\",  all the parts relating to one another well. And best of all, McCartney's voice sounds incredible (it's hard to believe he's 63!)-- it's strong and confident on the uptempo tracks, and vulnerable, wise, and, for lack of a better word, beautiful, on the more mellow numbers. <br /> <br />Chaos and Creation in the Backyard opens strongly, with Fine Line (also thefirst single), an up-tempo number that contains some interesting dissonance. It has a good lyric, of more depth than usual for a McCartney pop single. This is followed by \\"How Kind of You\\", a moody, mellow piece that reflects on the kindness of a friend (lover?) who was there in a time of need. <br /> <br />The beautiful, haunting Jenny Wren is next and features lovely acoustic guitar by Paul, in the tradition of some of his great guitar work on songs such as Blackbird, or Calico Skies. Its minor key and lovely chorus are well-matched to the simple, evocative lyrics. The plaintive solo (by Pedro Eustache, on an instrument called the duduc) is one of the high points of the album. I think this song may join the McCartney canon of greats. <br /> <br />At the Mercy, to my ears, has classical music elements; there are many interesting twists and turns to follow in this complex tune. The complexity of the tune perhaps makes it less easy to remember, but this is one of the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />McCartney has said that on the next number, Friends to Go, he felt inspired by George Harrison-- and the song does have a \\"Traveling Wilburys\\" kind of feel. In fact, it is the kind of tune George might have written, in his later career. It's a very likable, memorable tune and good tribute to George, if that is what it is meant to be.  <br /> <br />English Tea changes the mood again with its opening, which sounds like a passage imported from one of Paul's classical pieces. The song itself seems a mild parody of aristocratic life. It reminds me a bit of \\"Piggies\\" from the White Album, except where Piggies was an attack on the aristocracy, English Tea shows affection for the old English ways. <br /> <br />Too Much Rain opens with chords that sound familiar (they remind me of the song Lonely People by America). But it turns into another beautiful melody from Paul, and the song has a lovely piano/guitar arrangement.  The lyrics may sound trite at times, but the song works anyway. A great pop piece. <br /> <br />On A Certain Softness, McCartney creates a Latin-flavored piece which really works well, due to another well-conceived and executed arrangement. The song adds yet another bit of variety in texture to the overall album. The melody is excellent, if not quite as instantly memorable as some of McCartney's best work along these lines (And I Love Her, for example). Being a fan a Latin-flavored music, this is one of my favorites on the album. Paul's harmonies on the middle section are gorgeous. <br /> <br />Riding to Vanity Fair marks perhaps a first for McCartney, in that he reveals bitter feelings, the result of betrayal in friendship. The song's slow, atmospheric quality heightens the feeling of dazed confusion expressed by the words. The orchestration is excellent, recalling the song \\"Distractions\\", but is more understated here. I think McCartney should keep writing in this vein, because the lyrics in this song feel more real and more honest than the perfect ideal described in the very next song, Follow Me. One wonders, to what human being could these words be expressed (\\"I can rely on you to guide me through any situation\\"? Interestingly, since I write from a Christian point of view, this song, which seems to be about God, should probably appeal to me. But its melody isn't as inspired as other songs on this album, and one isn't so sure if there is heartfelt conviction in the song. For these reasons, Follow Me was probably my least favorite track. <br /> <br />Promise to You Girl is another great pop song from McCartney, inserting a needed burst of energy into this mostly mellow album. Paul, \\"looking through the backyard of my life\\", realizes it's \\"time to sweep the fallen leaves away\\". The song expresses the idea of taking stock and looking to the future with a determination to leave behind a positive mark on this world. And it does so with a catchy, fun tune that is typical Paul. This would be a good choice for the next single. <br /> <br />On This Never Happened Before, Paul has crafted yet another gorgeous love song, with chord changes reminiscent of Burt Bacharach. In the DVD interview, Paul relates how he lent out the song, prior to its official release, to a couple getting married (very sweet). <br /> <br />The album closes with a pair of love songs. Like Too Much Rain, Anyway also opens with a familiar-sounding chord progression (remember \\"People Get Ready\\" by Curtis Mayfield?). Still, Paul's song veers into much different musical territory after that. The song is a plea for lovers to re-unite (it feels perhaps as if they have been parted by a quarrel). But the narrator believes that their love is \\"strong enough to take it on the chin\\" and to \\"cure each others sorrow\\". He waits for her to \\"make that call\\", \\"anyway\\" she can. Both This Never Happened Before and Anyway could be criticized for their simplistic lyrics, but the music expresses emotional nuances that fills in what the words do not. Perhaps if the words were more complex, they might clash with the musical expression of emotion. <br /> <br />Finally, there is a instrumental jam that follows the last song, Anyway, that has points of interest although it is not really very cohesive.  It sounds really like three different musical passages strung together but the best of these passages is the piano section. <br /> <br />If you're planning on purchasing the album, I'd strongly recommend buying this Special Edition version, which includes along with the CD, an entertaining and informative 50 minute DVD, in which Paul talks about the making of Chaos and Creation. <br /> <br />Or to help you make up your mind about buying, right now you can listen to the album in its entirety at Sneek Peek from Q104NY online [...] <br />indexpreview.html <br /> <br />Chaos and Creation is a grownup work from an artist who obviously still has lots of creative juices flowing. Some fans and critics have lamented the lack of \\"rockers\\" on this album, but it seems Paul's latest batch of inspiration just didn't include those types of songs. Working with a strong producer was definitely a good move for Paul: this is a thoughtful, well-crafted album with no major \\"clunkers\\", as have appeared on most previous albums. Paul no longer needs to stake his reputation on the body of work he created with the Beatles, as wonderful as that body of work was. His body of work as a solo artist, and with Wings, is equally impressive. It remains to be seen whether or not this album's songs will live up to very high standards set by all of Paul's past work, to become his new classics. Still, McCartney is a true genius of pop, and he can (and should) hold his head up high with this album.
B000AL730O|5.0|At it's best this album conjures up Beatle Paul circa 1968 penning songs for the white album.  There are some moments of true McCartney magic.  I happen to really dig \\"How Kind of You\\" even though many have singled it out as a weaker tune.  Play it a few times and see if you aren't moved.  It's impressive to witness in this album genuinely new directions for Paul's music.  Some darker themes and just letting his guard down.  \\"Friends to Go\\" is a wonderful Harrison-esque romp.  \\"English Tea\\" makes me smile each time I hear it.  It would fit right in on Revolver.  By the way, the edition with the DVD is well worth the few extra dollars.  Excellent footage from the studio.

B0007GAERG|3.0|Ok first of all i dont see how great mariah carey is. Her music is good but she is a horrible person who says mean things about people all the time and her voice cracks. Like in Shake it off and We belong togeter her voice cracks atleast like 2 times. I mean anyways can sing her songs unlike eminem or usher who have are extremely talented and have amazing breath control. Many people just like her because she's so cute and innocent looking. So if u support this kind of person i guess its worth it but if you hate her dont buy it!

And to be sure, this one does have its longueurs and sophomoric passages (the women in particular come off rather squishy). But there's so much here to love. Many of the philosophical discussions really ARE interesting (you get Professor Robert Solomon discussing Existentialism!) and the explanations of lucid dreaming are spot on. The quality of the animation varies. Some of it seems a little crude and unimaginative. But much of it is quite beautiful and very appropriate. That last image especially haunts me still. <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite movies of the last 5 years. DVD quality is excellent. Superbargain price, too. Get it.
B000060P79|5.0|I really like this cd.  It has a great beat, and it fun to listen to.  If you enjoy upbeat and bouncy tunes, then you will really like this cd.  Mine gives me these really cool videos of the guys (you need Quicktime) which is fun to watch.  Oh, and one more thing, Mark Hoppus and Joel Madden are backup vocals in the songs: \\"I'd Do Anything\\" (my personal favorite) and \\"You Don't Mean Anything\\".  I hope my review helped, and if you are unsure whether to buy it, I recommend you should, you won't be disappointed.
B000AL730O|4.0|It may be unfair, but one cannot help making Beatle comparisons whenever an ex-member makes a record. Given the incredible impact the group made, both musically and sociologically, comparisons are inevitable and unavoidable.   Since the Beatles split, MacCartney has shown himself to be the premier musician of the group, of that there is no doubt. I particularly like 'This Never Happened Before' and 'Fine Line' on this album and the other tracks are all good to some degree. The 'secret' track at the end somehow doesn't fit at all and seems to be an attempt to repeat the ending of 'Wings Wild Life' but with little effect. A very good album but really a collection of songs rather than a true album with a theme: typical of today's materialistic, self-centred, aimless world. I recoil in horror at the rise of individualism and the decline of love over the past quarter century.   4 stars for a fine album by a huge but largely wasted talent.    Highly recommended for lovers of quality pop but nothing to see here for those seeking meaning and hope.

B00008J4P5|4.0|When I first heard \\"Seven Nation Army,\\" it almost literally took my breath away. So cool, so harsh. I actually didn't want to like them becasue of all the hoopla, but I started to, anyway. And the \\"last Button to Button\\" is just plain weird good fun. Doom, doom doom doom doom...doom. Bring it, Jack!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This is a very, very enjoyable CD to listen to over and over again straight through, esp. when you can sing along to every track after a while <br /> <br />I don't know if its groundbreaking R&B or anything, but I flat wore it out.  I really like her voice, and to know she plays and writes the stuff adds somthing to it.  Most importantly, she knows the value of the hook. <br /> <br />my favorite songs are the ones that never made radio
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I believe there should be a stronger romatic relationship between the captain and the companion, even if it is tentative. <br />I stronly disliked the captain's making love to the companion's <br />friend, and not even understanding why she was hurt.  I have seen all seven seasons of \\"Stargate SG 1\\", and it is quite obvious that the Colonel loves Carter even though it is not always shown. This keeps the interest of the viewer flowing.  Another thing, in the last episode, the companion says she is going to leave the boat... I can't believe this! She adds <br />beauty and elegance to the entire plot.  If she leaves the story <br />will be completely different, and you'll have to really bring out the other characters more!  Please keep the companion in the story and add more romance between her and the captain!
0743454537|5.0|Once in a while a book comes along that you will never forget.  You will remember where you were when you began reading it and where you were when you finished it.  With this book, that may very well be the exact same place because it doesn't lend itself to being read over a week or two...you start and NEED to finish.
B0000666DW|3.0|Usually, I stay away from metal.  I'm a straight up hardcore fan.  I induldge in stuff like Norma Jean and The bled.  But after hearing about Mastodon, I decided they might be different than the rest of the metal bands out there. <br /> <br />First off, I wouldn't rate this as metal...  it's more like Metalcore but whatever.  I would also not even call this music, but more like audio art.  Most of the songs on here are purely just for ear candy. there's a lot of cool sounds on Remission.  All of the songs are very different.  From the hard and fast opener: \\"Crusher Destroyer\\" to the country sounding \\"nessie\\"  Thi album covers much ground.  For the most part though, it's an offshoot of metalcore that delivers some great and not so great moments.  Me being a fan of hardcore, I instantly fell in love with \\"crusher Destroyer\\"  It's random, chaotic, and faster than anybody's business.  Sadly, this is a feeling that is not delivered throughought the album.   <br /> <br />Most tradtional fans of the genre will brush this off as artsy fartsy garbage.  But I think otherwise.  Mastodon are a band driven by quite a few unique elements.  The musicianship on here is very impressive, better than most bands in the pot.  The drumming is probably some of the best, inclusing the guitars which go great with it.  Also, the band tends to enjoy theme based songs and albums, another thing that adds to their artsy feel.  Also, emo fans should stay away.  This band has an odd way of appearing emo while really being quite the opposite.  The lyrics are mostly storyteller style.  I think this band just enjoys writing songs about random morbid things.  There's nothing wrong with that.  He's a great growler.   <br /> <br />I was also happy to find that the band is from my home state, Georgia.  It's great to see good bands like this coming out of a place normally removed of any good music.   <br /> <br />A final word before my song by song review, if you aren't quite open minded about music, youprobably won't like this.  Mastodon has an odd style about them that takes a few listens to stand.  Just give it a chance. <br /> <br />I rate really hard so dont worry if its low <br /> <br />1-Crusher Destroyer---9/10---This is easilly my fav in the album.  Great riffs, and great drumming.  It's a crazy ride of a song. <br /> <br />2-March of the fire ants---7.5/10---A song that doesn't get really awesome until the middle.  there's a great guitar solo here. <br /> <br />3-where strides the behemoth---7/20---fast and heavy.  Good breakdowns.  Awesome drums. <br /> <br />4-workhorse---7/20---It's just good.  The lyrics are pretty cool too. <br /> <br />5-ole nessie---6/10--The intro is a bit long but the song as a whole is good. <br /> <br />6-burning man---6.5/10---What can I say.  it's fast.  it's got more sick crumming...  I like it. <br /> <br />7-trainwreck---5/10---this is a real moody song.  It doesnt really do it for me, but the ending is still pretty cool. <br /> <br />8-trampled under hoof---7/10---it's good, it's fast, you'll like it. <br /> <br />9-trilobite---5/10---it's another moddy song, I dont really like it. <br /> <br />10-mother puncher---7.5/10---the lyrics are super cool and the guitarwork on here is great. <br /> <br />11-Elephant man---an instumental filler that doesnt even deserve a score. <br /> <br />CONCLUSION---This record is more hardcore than people give it credit for.  I recomend this to any openmided hardcore/metalcore/metal fan. <br />TOTAL <br />7/10
B00064AM6C|4.0|With just a slip to the left or the right, this could've been cheese or, worse, the band's miniature aesthetic could've been dwarfed by the surroundings.  <br /> <br />But \\"Under Blackpool Lights\\" has been put together with the same stark simplicity that makes the band so unique. Jack and Meg sling out one song after another -- Jack does his Robert-Plant-caught-in-a-wringer howl and moan; his guitars wail; Meg, sans shoes, pounds drums; fuzzy, red-lit crowds of fans roil all around and hand-held cameras capture the whole thing. It's gritty, it's grainy, it's groovin' and it's great.  <br /> <br />Here's what they play (in just about an hour and a half):  <br /> <br />1) \\"When I Hear My Name\\"  <br />2)\\"Black Math\\"  <br />3) \\"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\\"  <br />4) \\"I Think I Smell a Rat\\"  <br />5) \\"Take a Whiff on Me\\"  <br />6) \\"Astro\\"  <br />7) \\"Outlaw Blues\\"  <br />8) \\"Jack the Ripper\\"  <br />9) \\"Jolene\\"  <br />10) \\"Hotel Yorba\\"  <br />11) \\"Death Letter\\"  <br />12) \\"Do\\"  <br />13) \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\"  <br />14) \\"Truth Doesn't Make a Noise\\"  <br />15) \\"The Big Three Killed My Baby\\"  <br />16) \\"Wasting My Time\\"  <br />17) \\"You're Pretty Good Looking\\"  <br />18) \\"Hello Operator\\"  <br />19) \\"Apple Blossom\\"  <br />20) \\"Ball and Biscuit\\"  <br />21) \\"Let's Shake Hands\\"  <br />22) \\"I Fought Pirhanas\\"  <br />23) \\"Let's Build a Home\\"  <br />24) \\"Goin' Back to Memphis\\"  <br />25) \\"Seven Nation Army\\"  <br />26) \\"De Ballit of De Boll Weevil\\"
B000000WJZ|5.0|I owned this on cassette when I was a teenager and listened to it over and over again. I just thought to look it up on the internet and found that it was just as good as ever. It's true that you can listen to it from beginning to end without being bored. Many songs are truly beautiful and bring back memories of my younger years. I am in agreement with many people that this is The Smashing Pumpkins' greatest album.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Classic film with one of the scariest scenes i have ever scene.  Pure suspence and tension not dum bimbos with red underwear geting slaughtered in a grusome way it is much more realistice.

B0009IW9DE|5.0|The Lonesome Jubilee remastered edition is a great album made even better! If you have the original release of this cd I highly recomend that you buy this one, as well. Even if you are just a casual John Mellencamp fan you will love it!      The other reviewers do an excellent job of describing Lonesome Jubilee, so there is no reason for me to be redundant.     However, I disagree with the other reviewers (and most rock critics) who feel that John Mellencamp is a poor-man's Bruce Springsteen. John Mellencamp is not a poor man's anything or anybody.     The two main arguments behind the new Springsteen tag are the fact that Mellencamp sings about his region and writes introspective songs. The Beach Boys wrote about their region and John Lennon wrote introspectively.  I don't hear or see any mention of those two facts in regards to Springsteen.    I have been a Springsteen fan since the mid-70s and I have always enjoyed his music very much. His music is a big part of the sound track of my high school and college days. However, I feel Mellencamp's music and song writing is even better than that of the BOSS. When Mellencamp released the Scarecrow album people were saying that he was just copying Springsteen's Born In The USA theme. I was always quick to point out that the song Pink Houses came out before Born In The USA did. I guess what I'm trying to say is that Mellencamp is Mellencamp!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was an amazing TV show. I personally am not a fan of the Buffy tv series, but Joss Whedon did a fantastic job with Firefly. The characters are all well rounded with strenghts and weaknesses, the humor is well placed and truly funny, the plot is deep and intriguing. By episode 14 you really just want to see more and more. A wonderful show, great plots, great characters. Naturally, Fox would have none of it and canceled the show at episode 14. Thankfully a feature film is due out this Sept. 30. Go see \\"Serenity\\" in theatres and buy the series on DVD. You WON'T regret it.
B00068CVJ4|4.0|This album had potential. Too bad it was released on a very bad low budget record label. The mixing could have been at least 10 times better. But I still love this CD.
0517122707|3.0|As much as I hate to divide a novel into neat compartments, this one surely deserves such a treatment. The undeniable core of the famous book - inhabited supremely by Ignatius J. Reilly - represents some of the finest imagination and humanity put to paper in American literature. Nothing like a deliciously insane, absurdly overeducated, overfed main character to pillar a story. Ignatius is elegantly drawn, his every movement and word perfectly, wildly entertaining. The other parts of the book sag and bore by comparison. Jumbled, ugly, dead-end dialogue, an abundance of overly silly misadventures and a story arc that never snaps to life.
B0002S947K|5.0|Ray's voice sounds like it was formed from years of hardship and wine, his lyrics bear his soul, and his playing - whether slow acoustic, bluesy electric, or any other - give us a soundscape to not only remember him, but to shape our own lives by. This is a truly amazing musician and I recommend his album to any and everyone.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|This is, without question, my favorite record/cd this year (never mind that it came out last year, I only became aware of it through word of mouth in 05).  Yes, there is a lot of Billie Holiday influence, none more apparent than Don't Cry Baby, but I think the detractors are missing the point, what Peyroux has that the majority of the others don't is that elusive thing called \\"soul\\" which only the great ones (Lady Day, Ella, Edith Piaf, to name but a few) have.  I  can think of no higher compliment to give this record than to say this:  that everytime I play this from start to finish, I am sorry that it has to end after the last song. <br /> <br />Highest recommendation.
B000641ZA4|4.0|There is really so much to say about music videos on DVD. At times, most of those haven't hit the exact nails on the head. While others seem to have something simply missing. For Genesis, they have came a long, long way since their art cult days in the 1970's. Arguably, it still remains sad they have disbanded several years. While Phil Collins made a staple of himself as a vocalist on his own in the 80's, so did his days with the trio group besides Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks. Now for the first time, those glory days can be celebrated from the past, and now the present to turn on again.<br /><br />Genesis: The Video Show, was released on the heels of the boxed set anthology The Platinum Collection. While that album does miss out quite a bit, the DVD does deliver. This compilation consists of all of Genesis and those great tracks from the Phil Collins era quite well. The music videos have been restored very nicely, and still bring out the feeling the group once had. There are so many great videos here including Jesus He Knows Me, Hold On My Heart, Illegal Alien, Invisible Touch, Misunderstanding, as well as rare videos like Tell Me Why, Anything She Does, the deep and dark Congo, and No Reply At All. While this era does deliver, some longtime fans may be a bit dissapointed. For fans of Peter Gabriel, and when he was the lead of the group, tracks for The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, Trespass, and From Genesis To Revolution aren't actually highlighted at all, aside from the 1999 remake of The Carpet Crawlers from the Turn It On Again hits package.<br /><br />Despite a couple of flaws, Genesis: The Video Show really does deliver very well, and is absolutely a must have for anybody who wants to enjoy great pop music from Phil Collins and company. This is the music video DVD event of the year, and that is no misunderstanding.<br /><br />Cover: B+<br /><br />Price: A-<br /><br />Videos: A-<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This by far is the best album put out by the Foo Fighters. I have always listened to their music. Definitely being my #1 favorite band, and this album blows it away. Dave Grohl has an amazing voice and the lyrics are simply amazing. Just an all around great listen and a neccessary add to any CD collection. The 2 CD's was a great idea.. one to rock out to and another for a more mellow mood. Genius in every aspect, the best in my book. A MUST HAVE!!!  ..Pick it up soon.
0375751513|5.0|I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.<br /><br />The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.<br /><br />The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.<br /><br />Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.<br /><br />I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave.ever at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true!

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Yes, this is the fan's long-waited sequel to the 1997 game.  Those who have no knowledge of the game will be severly confused.  As I am a fan of the game, I was extensely happy when this movie was announced for release (when they announced it years ago) and was not disipointed. <br /> <br />Graphically, the movie is beautiful (as are apparently all the characters in it) and flawless in my opinion. <br /> <br />Story-wise, it strikes the hearts of FF7 fans the most and, as I mentioned before, might be confusing to those who have little or no knowledge of FF7 (even though Marlene over-views the game at the beginning of the movie). <br />~The story takes place mainly within Midgar and is full of both explainations, surprises, action, and drama... <br />~The group is back and faced with a task to stop new enemies; the Turks help out, too; And our Hero, Cloud, has to rekindle his fighting spirit in order to save all that he cares about and the world--a task only he would be able to acomplish as his Showdown of Fate continues--and finally gains a long-waited resolution... <br /> <br />Audio: There are several returning FF7 songs that have been upgraded for this movie--even to the battle-victory theme (haha; I hadn't expected it...so I burst out laughing).  The music fits, overall, and lives up to the FF legacy.  The ending theme (are we getting the Japanese song in the US?) was cool, just as the ending sequence it was playing in. <br /> <br />Extras: Hmm...not sure what we're all getting in the US...but for the lucky ones, some of the Japanese versions came with the \\"Last Order\\" OAV--we are not getting this in the US, I believe (which I find rather stupid).  I believe we're getting the trailers (which I already have seen like 50-million times), but I'm not sure until I buy it... <br /> <br />Overall, it's Great.  It could have been better if they had made it longer~!  It's full of fast-passed action which will make fans tingly as you watch it two or three times in a row to catch everything (such as the little pink-ribbon on our 8 heroes' arms), and to laugh at the Turks antics again and again, and laugh at the bad-guys for being fooled for half the movie by a character I used to hate. <br /> <br />Well...I shan't go into any more detail on the movie (I'll just go watch it again). <br /> <br />Favorite Quote the the Whole Movie~: \\"\\"Watashi wa...Omoide niwa nara nai sa...\\"\\" (^-^; If you don't know who said it...you can watch it to find out who's line it is~!)
B0009HLDFU|5.0|i don't know what this ea-pty dude is talking about, because i ripped it to itunes without a problem, and have succesfuly burned 4 copies, as well as planted it on my brother and mines ipods.<br /><br />honestly, i haven't really listened to the first CD, but i'm in LOVE with the 2nd one. there's something magical about the foo fighters playing acoustic. \\"still\\", \\"over and out\\", and \\"another round\\" are without a doubt my favourites, and my guitar is probably damaged from playing \\"on the mend\\" so much.<br /><br />it really bugged me when the foo fighters got all mainstream and popular, but i still love their stuff. \\"one by one\\" is still an amazing album, and now this just adds to it.<br /><br />i defiantly sugest getting this album, it's a fanastic listen as well as jam album.
B00005JOHU|5.0|Nicolas Cage (Face/Off, Family Man, upcoming Weather Man) stars as Yuri Orlov, who is an arms dealer who sells guns to people in other countries....where their for he gets money. Along the while he has a brother named Vitaly, played nicely by Jared Leto (Alexander, Requiem For A Dream, Urban Legend) but here's the thing, Vitaly has a cocaine problem and tends to bring hooker like women around all the time. Leto helps his brother Cage in the business. Cage falls for once glamour modle Ava Fontaine, played by Bridget Moynahan (Sum Of All Fears, The Recruit), the fall in the love and have a kid named Nicky. Cage buys her nice things, clothes, jewerly in the process. Ethan Hawke (Assault On Precinct 13, Tape, Taking Lives) plays Agent Jack Valentine who will do anything to bring down Cage and him manufactoring guns...in which case it wont happen because there's a lot more people around the world who manufactor guns as well. Cage brings life to his performance in Yuri...terrific as always Cage is....and I dont think any other actor would be right for the role. In the same vein as Three Kings. One of the best movies of the year...right up there with Crash and Sin City...well, that's just me for ya anyway. Also starring Ian Holm (Lord OF The Rings Trilogy, Aviator).
B00004VW35|3.0|I'd really rate this more of a 2.5, but with Neil I prefer to err on the positive side.  Most of you probably know the story with this album.  It very nearly never saw the light of day, and was a factor in a lawsuit that label Geffen brought against Young for making uncommercial and uncharacteristic music.  So with all the hooplah surrounding it, I franky expected something more remarkable.  Was it a lost classic, wrongly dismissed by a soulless record label?  Was it a diamond in the rough, hampered by overblown arrangements and digital recording techniques that were still in their infancy?  Or was it just a steaming turd that should never have been released?  I found it to be none of these things.  Neil had dabbled in country inflected sounds before, to much success, but this record is  undeniably his most blatantly country, including those released since.  Admittedly a little too country for my tastes, but I like to think I'm open minded enough to not let that alone scare me away.  The album as a whole is quite listenable.  The arangements are sometimes overdone, but that pretty much goes with the style of music.  Guest stars show up perhaps too frequently, but they manage to avoid stealing the show.  There really aren't any cringe inducing stinkers that make you want to stop listening.  In fact, you could probably sneak a few tracks on to any number of Neil's other records without them seeming too out of place.  Its main flaw is that nothing really stands out.  Sure, its all nice pleasant music, but I expect more from a writer of Neil's calibre.  So the real question is, should I buy this?  Well, if you are a long time fan like me who has been avoiding it due to the bad rep, give it a chance.  Its not going be the first record you play to win over cynics, but its worth having in the collection.  Although he's certainly not at his best, this is the real Neil, he's not just going through the motions.  I'll take it over landing on water any day of the week. If you love Neil's mellower work, you'll probably appreciate this one as well.  But if you're a more recent fan, you can probably find plenty of other things to buy first, and if you're a die hard rocker, this may be too much country for you to handle.

B00079FUI6|5.0|This amazing mixture of malicious joy, touching slapstick, mocking eroticism or pitiful criminal involvement, established someplace between \\"Friends\\" or \\"Golden Girls\\", indeed has the strength to be a replacement for the famous \\"Sex and the City\\".<br /><br />Though some Americans are indignant at it (not unmarried ladies, much worse, married women are practicing an immoral life-style; this way would undermine the \\"respect for men\\") - nevertheless (I think they judge wrongly) - this series have absolutely earned their cult status.<br /><br />Eva Longoria (as Gabrielle Solis) absolutely surpasses that Denver clan witch Joan Collins in the art of men manipulating.

However, she is cheated by her husband (mixing up anti baby pills) Carlos Solis (played by Ricardo Chavira), therefore she expects a baby, and nastily does not know of whom.<br /><br />The story is always laid out in a manner, that the mishaps of the protagonists hardly sink the spectator into great mourning.<br /><br />So Martha Huber (represented by Christine Estabrook convincingly nastily), who is disgustingly carrying out an investigation and blackmailing, but oldish but nevertheless very dangerous, is killed without further fuss by Paul Young (played by Mark Moses) - it is hardly unpardonable.<br /><br />Of course Paul Young still has some more secrets:<br /><br />Why his Mrs Mary Alice Young (the voice in the \\"offstage\\": Brenda Strong, earlier film: \\"Everwood\\") has committed suicide ?<br /><br />Why does she live under a false name?<br /><br />Has her son Zach (Cody Kasch) murdered the little daughter (\\"Dana\\")?<br /><br />Do they have sunk the corpse in the lake or really still another person (dismembered)?<br /><br />The problems of Lynette Scavo are comparatively harmless (played by Felicity Huffman, earlier film: \\"Sports\\" Night):<br /><br />She is troubled with 4 children (2 of them are rather ineducable twins) - for example in front of everyone she (in a precious party evening dress) had to drag her noisy kids out of a swimming pool.<br /><br />Of course her husband Tom Scavo (played by Doug Savant) does not reward her efforts adequately.<br /><br />A substantially more complicated show is given by the red-haired conservative, the prudish one \\"Law-and-order\\" Bree Van De Kamp (unbelievably well embodied by Marcia Cross, earlier film: \\"Melrose Place\\").<br /><br />At first she thinks to have everything under control by cleaning the house perfectly.<br /><br />This does not suffice.<br /><br />She thereupon additionally tries to get satisfied dutifully the perverted sexual habits of her husband Rex Van De Kamp (played by Steven Culp):<br /><br />Nastily at a visit of a dominatrix establishment days before her husband had suffered a heart attack.<br /><br />The requirements on Bree's super management talent are screwed always more highly in the course of the series:<br /><br />Not only, that she must cope with addiction behaviors and homosexuality of her son, she also hushes the fact that this one (with an accompanying hit-and-run driving) has run over an older woman with his car (the mother of Carlos Solis, dying later in the hospital).<br /><br />But to escape such gloominess and to make it easy for the spectators to stand by, there is the funny, slapstick part of Susan Mayer too, a sort of princess of the \\"faux pas\\" (played by Teri Hatcher, she has got the \\"Golden Globe\\" for this).<br /><br />However the plumber Mike Delfino, gazed adoringly by her, is not a plumber (but he became entangled in private investigations (played by James Denton).<br /><br />But it's funny to see him find Susan either locked out stark-nakedly in her front garden or hanging desperately in the ceiling in a broken hole even in his own house .<br /><br />\\"Sex and the City\\" quite a lot concerned with shoes and other Life style articles.<br /><br />\\"Desperate Housewives\\" (= DH) satisfies our own longing for mockery and malicious joy and the wish of having the strength to overcome awkward situations;<br /><br />It helps us to compare and to relativize marriage problems humorously.<br /><br />In short: DH makes our life easier.<br /><br />Marc Cherry, who has created this enviably witty plot (he was involved in the works to \\"Golden Girls\\") has done a good service not only for the spectators but also for himself: Once he had burned down financially so much, that he had to borrow money from his mother;

0930289234|5.0|I've read only a few of Alan moores graphic novels. I'm glad to have read this one. Dave Gibbons illustrations are quite complementary to the text. It looks, and feels similar to most superhero comics of the 80's. Yet, what sets it apart is the epic scope that Moore creates with the incorparation of historical fiction, and turning two dimensional superheroes into three dimensional human beings. The annotations at the end of every chapter also help add depth to a world that your are instantly catapulted into from the very first page.<br /><br />  Watchmen is simply captivating. This book seems way a head of it's time. I'm glad that I read the book for the first time as a young adult. If I had read it as a child, I don't think I would have possessed the cognitive skills to undestand and enjoy it at the level that I did. If you've never read any of Alan Moores work, this is a good starting point. I highly recommend it.
0385507755|5.0|This was by far one of the most moving, beautiful, inspirational book I have ever read.  I am not an alcoholic or addict, but read this book from cover to cover putting it down only when necessary.   In my opinion, a MUST READ for anyone and everyone who has any interest in human will,  the human spirit and the love of life.  <br />
B00003CXI1|5.0|Jameson Thottam and my family first started reading this launch of the series 5 years ago.  <br /> <br />The movies have been a Thottam family past time (filled with discussions on insider trading tips on what we think each new will bring and what sec rets the future holds in store for Harry.  <br /> <br />This was the first installment in the Harry Potter Saga and is truly a winner with suspense, sadness and adventure all rolled into one (something you would expect no less from Rowlings imaginative brain). Coming from corporate America (such firms as Morgan Stanley, IndyMac Bank and Homestore), I have found the series a nice respite from the day to day work life and a return to child like wonders for this Thottam family child at heart. This book in particular captures the children in a more mature phase and seeing that evolution is always thrilling as we take part in their lives.  <br /> <br />Hope you in enjoy this, as the Thottam family has,  <br /> <br />-Jameson Thottam
B00028U6B8|4.0|I like this music becuase it's real. People say that Jefferson Airplane is a bunch of Commie idiots, but I find them pretty thoughtful. The thing is, life is good, war is bad, and you always wind up stationed in Germany for awhile. Yeah, I give out the gear, and I'm proud to do it for the right cause, but now I'm not so sure. Anyway, let's just get toasted and have a listen...
B000AL730O|5.0|Back in 2001 when \\"Driving Rain\\" came out, I thought the long and winding road had hit a dead end.  I am in my 30's and had just seen Sir Paul in concert for his \\"Back in the USA\\" tour.  This was my second McCartney concert experience and you know how sometimes you look forward to hearing songs from an artist's new album.  Unfortunately, nothing from \\"...Rain\\" I was looking forward to or could compare with the old solo standards, \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\"...\\"Band on the Run\\"...etc. <br /> <br />I bought \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" without any expectations of anything different.  I had already planned to see Paul in concert October 2005 and was going to be content with the old standards I had heard two times before.  As I normally do, I stuck the new CD in and looked for maybe that one song that I thought would be something I might like...fortunately...there wasn't one in the bunch that I did not like.  At that point, I almost teared up thinking about the old standards I was going to hear in October as well as the new 'fresh' music from Mr. \\"M's\\" new album. <br /> <br />What I like most about \\"Chaos...\\" is the remarkable simplicity of the melodies...In particular, 'Jenny Wren' and 'English Tea' made in Paul classic acoustic brings the whimsical days of 'Blackbird', 'Martha My Dear' back into my heart.  Melodies you remember...Mr. McCartney is giving us more incredible gifts.  The more upbeat 'Fine Line', 'Riding to Vanity Fair' and 'Friends to Go' keep the album going with typical no-nonsense lyrics which only can remind the true Beatles fan of the days of Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour. <br /> <br />I am a big fan of \\"Chaos...\\", and like Paul's early solo albums like \\"McCartney\\", \\"Ram\\", \\"Band on the Run\\" etc., this album you will remember...Thank you Paul.
B00000G3AZ|1.0|Where to start?  If you are a fan of the book you will not like the many liberties the film has taken.  Many key scenes are changed or added to.  Many characters suffer changes either from the script or the actors who portray them.    For example, when Mr. Elton, Harriet and Emma are walking together and Emma stops to cut her bootlace and urges the others to go on because she wants them to be alone but when she see's a passing child she starts to walk with him and when they draw too close to Harriet and Mr. Elton she grabs on to the boy while he struggles to get away.  Can you imagine a lady of Emma's class holding on to a struggling little boy simply to allow two people to be alone?  Then there is Mrs. Bates who seems like a slow-witted woman who giggles at everything and has an I.Q. of 2 instead of a woman of good temperament who is a chatterbox. Harriet seems to have no brain at all and when told that Emma and Mr. Knightley are engaged she breaks down and sobs (you really only see Robert Martin two or three brief times at the beginning of the movie and then he is mostly forgotten until we find out that Harriet is going to marry him). Jane Fairfax seems to carry an expression of snobbiness more than reserve.  Frank Churchill (who is the only character with longer hair, which I don't understand), is introduced to the audience when he comes on horseback and finds Emma, alone, sitting on her carriage in a small pool of water with the wheel stuck.  As to Mr. Frank Churchill's character, very little is made of the triangle between him, Jane, and Emma.  The script was also changed so that it is now Frank who introduces the idea of Mr. Dixon having affection for Jane.  Also, Mr. Elton almost seems like a dog when talking to Emma. In one scene after he inquires after her father she thanks him for his thoughtfulness and he says, \\"Thank you for thinking I am thoughtful.\\" and when Mr. Elton proposes to Emma he practically accosts her in the carriage. He doesn't seem to be able to keep his hands off her.  As for Emma herself, she seems purely cruel.  While walking down the street with Harriet, she spies Mrs. Bates coming and her and Harriet quickly dash under a tent and hide themselves with their umbrella's.  At Box Hill when she makes her comment about Mrs. Bates not being limited by saying three dumb things, she seems to think about it before she says it and when confronted by Mr. Knightley she defends herself at first.  Anyway, I could go on and on from the variations from the book.    I understand that when making a book into a movie certain changes must be made, however in this case, they were all unnecessary and this is proven by the remarkable A&E adaptation.     I rented both movies from the library to judge for myself and I could barely get through this version.  Hollywood changed too much for my taste. The A&E adaptation is certainly better cast and acted.  The right attention is given to all of the characters and indeed, the writers and actors of A&E's version seem to understand the characters and story better. It seems that the writers and director of this film changed many parts only to make the entire film a comedy they thought today's audience would enjoy.  Well, there is such a thing as trying too hard and this is the proof.      Therefore, I urge you all of you who are fans of the book, for your own sakes, not to even bother watching this out of curiosity.  Save yourself the time and get A&E's version with Kate Beckinsdale as Emma.  That adaptation is well worth it.
B000AA305M|3.0|All of the reviewers seem to just love everything this guy does...but I must warn the unaware that this is not very uplifting stuff. If all you know of David Gray is Babylon and or the White Ladder CD--then I'll tell you now this is not WL II. It does sound a lot like Cold Play at times. It's certainly not a bad offering..this guy is really talented to be sure..more so that most of the *%#** that gets released these days. I just wish there were more dynamic to this CD because it truly seems to be \\"music in slow motion.\\" If you want to know what I mean by Dynamics listen to a Simon and Garfunkel CD ie Bookends is a great example.
0399103422|3.0|I have this to say: this silly novel was badly-written, unrealistic, and it made those at the head of the industry of evil seem aristocratic, merely because they were sufficiently removed to keep their hands from getting dirty and bloody. The best thing that ever happened to Mr. Puzo was the release of the superior film version of this campy book. Because of the film, some of the gravitas there has transferred to this novel, which strictly taken on its own horrendously misses the mark.
B000002NCW|5.0|This album contains some of the most beautiful Irish/Celtic music that can be found anywhere.  All of the songs are wonderful, espically \\"Flowers Of The Forest\\".  Each song is powerful in its own right, but as a whole this album truly spectacular.  Mike Oldfield does a remarkable job with each song and this album is a definite must for any Mike Oldfield fan or and New Age, Irish/Celtic music fan.
B000AA305M|4.0|First of all, let me say I'd like to give this 4.5 stars.  It's close to being perfect, like his White Ladder album.  David Gray's music has definitely moved up an echelon from his New Day at Midnight cd.  While that album wasn't necessarily bad, it wasn't great either, and not what I consider typical David Gray.  With Slow Motion, David has gone back to less processed and synthesized sounds, and is back to a simple acoustic driven album.  We get more melody, harmonies, and a real raw and emotional voice coming through in all these tracks.  It certainly sounds like he doesn't hold back on his vocals here, and it's wonderful.  A lot of these songs also have backing vocals from a woman, or women in some cases, and they are incorporated beautifully. <br /> <br />Best songs on this album would have to be track 3, Lately.  I get a definite James Taylor vibe from this song.  Track 4, Nos Da Cariad is about as processed as a song gets on this album, and it has wonderful backing vocals to support it.  My favourite has to be track 6, From Here You Can Almost See The Sea.  This song could have easily been placed on his White Ladder album.  It involves a very simple yet effective guitar line, and we hear David reach some pretty impressive falsetto notes on this one.  A very wonderful song, one of his best to date, no doubt about it. <br /> <br />The closing track, Disappearing World is also wonderful.  Overall, there are no skippable tracks on this album.  David Gray's back again, and it's about time!
B000AADYYO|5.0|Basically this is up there for album of the year also, along with a couple others.  What can be said about Opeth that already hasn't?  Track for track this album is unbelievable, it's not my favorite in their catalog though.  It makes sense though, this band has released 7 other great albums.  If you are a metal elitist, maybe you shouldn't bother with this and stick to your hammerfall records.   <br /> <br />Any fan of good metal music (ie. not atreyu like bands) should definately pick this one up.
B0000042H4|5.0|There are so many fine reviews of this set before you, that you probably don't need one more, but like so many others here, I feel too strongly about this RING not to throw my two cents in.   So here goes.    First a tiny bit of background:   I am a composer, and in particular, have written music for film/drama.   I have read much about Wagner's desire to fuse music and drama in a way that is completely organic, and feel very sympathetic to it.   I am also an avid listener, and am interested in the problems of interpretation as they apply to different mediums (stage, concert, recording).   It is with these interests I began listening to different recordings of Wagner Rings, and Wagner operas, in general.   The experience has been nothing short of amazing.    Now on the the recording featured here:  I have listened to at least major parts of different rings, and approached them comparatively (Furtwangler's Walkure, followed by Solti's, etc.), and in doing so have familiarized myself with so many details of the score.   One of the things I've noticed about Solti and Culshaw's approach-and incidently, the one major aspect that has drawn the most dissent AND praise at the same time by reviewers, is their approach to the medium of recording as a \\"thing\\" in and of itself.   A listener who has not actually been to a lot (or possibly any) live RING performances, and has only seen it on video will not fill in a lot of the \\"incidental\\" sounds coming through their speakers with much of their own visual memories.   Therefore, a spear hitting a rock, as overheard by a recording mic during a live taping will simply not have the same impact at home as it did in the opera house, unless the listener has built up a fair share of aural/visual memory over the years of actually \\"being there\\".   To the rest of us, it loses a little bit in the translation (you just hear a little \\"ting\\" between musical phrases).   It is home listeners like us, that I believe Solti and Culshaw had in mind when they worked out all the important \\"noises\\" in the fabric of the drama, and even in the pure musical moments of the orchestra's part.   It is this single factor, I believe, that has inspired so much contention among listeners and critics.   Did Solti and Culshaw go too far and sacrifice too much to carry the \\"visual\\" element over to recordings?   Are the markings on the score still being obeyed?   Is some subtlety lost?   I think the answer among listeners can only be a subjective one, and the reason for that is this:   This man Wagner wrote a work that (especially at that time) could never adequately transfer from the imagination to the stage.   There weren't (and still aren't) the kind of \\"special effects\\" available to make the kinds of things you're supposed to see and experience real.   Every production, no matter how much money is thrown into it, will never be anything but a poor compromise.   Read Wagner's own notes, and that becomes painfully clear.   Live recordings become even more of a diminishment, without the listener already having a strong imagination, and a complete grasp of everything that's going on.   In essence, a \\"traditional\\" approach to recording this work piles yet one more compromise on top of all the others, and the result is a \\"you really had to be there\\" experience for those among us that I've already described.    I think that Solti and Culshaw do a fantastic job of closing the gap, and after hearing other conductors, I believe Solti's approach to the score is essentially a faithful, if somewhat personal one.   He DOES push the climaxes a bit, but not, I think, at the expense of the music.   I still hear plenty of subtlety and wonderful musicality.   The lyricism of the score is completely intact, and everything flows.   AND it is a very exciting interpretation.   If one prefers a more understated approach, there are other options, but for me, this version has the best combination of all elements, and is by far the best suited to the medium of recording for home listening.       The singers are a combination of having the best chops for this kind of work, or at least (in the case of Hotter), enough interpretive brilliance to more than offset any lack of vocal ease in this demanding writing.   Others have already said everything I could want to say about the vocal talent here.    That is all I will say about this recording.   There is a reason that it is one of the most discussed recorded releases of the 20th century.  There will never be another like it.
B0009UVBQI|5.0|This movie kicked ass.I've seen alot of kung fu flicks and this one is my new favorite.This movie was far better than Stephen Chow's last film Shaolin Soccer.Even some of the cast from that movie star in this one but they have smaller parts and are mostly upstaged by the kung fu masters who have incredible fighting techniques.There was also alot of comedy which I enjoyed.Overall I'd say this is a must have.
0312995423|4.0|There's something here for everyone. Short chapters and oversimplified technical explanations make the vapid reader feel smart. The more astute may savor the stinkiness of Dan Brown's early work. The research, the writing, the characters, the dialogue, the plot - it's all comically bad. <br /> <br />Meet David, a language professor, and the heroine's boyfriend: <br /> <br />\\"Over six feet tall, Becker moved across a squash court faster than any of his colleagues could comprehend. After soundly beating his opponent, he would cool off by dousing his head in a drinking fountain and soaking his tuft of thick, black hair. Then, still dripping, he'd treat his opponent to a fruit shake and a bagel.\\" <br /> <br />The whole book is like that. <br /> <br />This isn't five star stinky, but it's close.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Well I was pleasantly surprised by all the blood and gore not to mention cannibilism,hookers and smoking.I like this movie.It is definitely a dark thriller with a touch of color here and there.The narration is great.You almost feel like your inside one of Frank Millers Sin City graphic novels.Hartigan and Marv are my absolute favorite charachters in this film.Hartigan is a good cop with a sense of honor that you don't see anywhere else in the movie and Marv is the biggest meanest thug in Sin City willing to do whatever it takes to avenge his love Goldie.All of the women in this movie are Hot but Jessica Alba(Nancy Callahan) is,in my humble opinion; ON FIRE!!!!
B000AL730Y|4.0|Fine Line is easily the best song on the CD.  It is upbeat and catchy.  I liked it immediately.  The rest of the CD is taking some time to grow on me.  I am a fan of the upbeat McCartney, so the other songs on this CD that stick with me are Friends to Go, English Tea, and Promise To You Girl.  Too Much Rain and Jenny Wren are good songs too.  The rest of the CD sounds a bit glum, but as several people have said, it grows on you. <br /> <br />Every time Paul releases a new work, the comparisons to his earlier work are inevitable.  Even so, I think all of Paul's work since 1989's Flowers In The Dirt show a similar pattern - some songs very upbeat and catchy, some nice ballads, and some songs that sound like he never quite took the time to finish them. <br /> <br />If you're looking for Paul to match his efforts with the (very competitive) Beatles or Band on the Run, it's not here.  But if you're a McCartney fan, you will find a lot to like on this CD. <br /> <br />The DVD is also very much worth it.  Nice documentary about the making of the CD (although, sometimes the look in Paul's eye hints that he is not telling it completely like it is), the music video for Fine Line and some other incidental stuff are there too. <br /> <br />Paul has spent so much time on the road in the last few years, touring and promoting causes, is he getting tired? <br />
1402714580|5.0|This was one of my favorite books as a child -- and even now, the chapter \\"Dark Days\\" (and other parts, too!) make me cry. I NOW find the character of the mother (\\"Marmee\\") and her constant moralizing annoying; but it's still a great book. And little girls still read it and weep over it (I volunteer in schools and meet a lot of kids).<br /><br />I think this is because the characters of the girls and Laurie are so real and the book has so much more heart than many things published now; but who knows? At different times in my life, I've liked each of the sisters (except Meg) the best and think this is quite common though most of us first like Jo.  At any rate, I believe in the characters and find the book touching...even when I'm annoyed by Marmee! I just ignore her moralizing as I probably would have tried to do in real life if she had been my mother.<br /><br />Two facts: If you visit Boston, you can go to Concord and see one of the houses where Louisa May Alcott lived -- it's now a museum and furnished as it would have been in her day. And the conversation in my novel BLOW OUT THE MOON about Litle Women, Jo, and Amy is one of the things that happened in real life just as it does in the book.

B00005JOHU|5.0|This movie was superbly done, so well that if it would have tilted but an inch it would've been the worst movie ever, that inch never comes, and the movie travels, so brilliantly, so thoughtfully, so greatly through scene from scene, that it could very well be the best movie Cage has done in the last fifteen years.
B0007GAERG|3.0|Mariah Carey is one of the most overrated artists of all-time. Yes, it's true, she can really sing. She is beautiful, but if you think about it, does she really deserve all of the achievements she's gotten? Mariah is trying too hard to keep up with the other R&B divas of today (Amerie, Beyonc, Ashanti, Alicia Keys, ect.) She needs to realize that she doesn't need to dress like a slut to sell records (even though it seems like it's working). I know that you Mariah fanatics are going to give this review a bad rating because I'm telling the truth, but oh well! I personally don't think she is all that but this CD is pretty good, I've got to admit that. <br /> <br />1. It's Like That (7/10) - This record totally sounds like something Mariah paid someone to write for her. I like it a lot though. People try to say it's a \\"club song\\" although it's really not. It's more like a feel good song. <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together (9/10) - OK, if you live on this planet and do not know this song, you need to be shot. This song was extremely over played on the radio, on television, ect. It's a beautiful song, I'm not going to lie about that, but was it really that good? I mean it's nice but I've heard better... <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off (10/10) - The absolute best song on the album! I have to give Mariah props for this song. I love it so much! It hasn't become more popular than We Belong Together but it should. It's like 20x better than We Belong Together. I give the album 3 stars instead of 2 because of this song. I could put this on repeat in the car and just jam! <br /> <br />4. Mine Again (5/10) - A smooth, slower track. It's alright. It's not all that but I give it 5 out of 10. <br /> <br />5. Say Somethin' (featuring Snoop Dogg) (4/10) - Let me just say, Mariah & Snoop are like the two oddest people to do a record together. That's like Martha Stewart & 50 Cent baking a cake together. LOL! This song is nice. I like Snoop a lot. He saves the song. Plus, it was produced bythe Neptunes. <br /> <br />6. Stay The Night (8/10) - I like this song. It has a grown and sexy vibe to it. I picture Mariah singing on stage at a prom when I hear this song. It's nice. <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number (featuring Jermaine Dupri) (6/10) - An upbeat track. This isn't a club track either though. I don't see Mariah being a club banger type of artist. Jermaine ruins the song! Why can't he just let Mariah sing it? The rating goes down because of his big mouth. <br /> <br />8. One and Only (featuring Twista) (6/10) - It's funny how Mariah tries to sing fast like Twista in the beginning. She needs to stop! LOL. It's a nice song! I like it. Her voice is nice but it doesn't fit the beat. <br /> <br />9. Circles (0/10) - Doesn't stand out in my mind. NEXT..... <br /> <br />10. Your Girl (0/10) - Another album filler....NEXT.... <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew (0/10) - OK, YOU SOUND A HOT MESS MIMI...NEXT... <br /> <br />12. To The Floor (featuring Nelly) (10/10) - Another Neptunes produced track. This time, it's a hit! It's hot!! I like how Nelly makes the track have a certain grown folks vibe to it. Mariah's voice is perfect on this track. I give \\"Mimi\\" her props on this song. <br /> <br />13. Joy Ride (0/10) - ZzZzZzZzZz.......Boring.... <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird (9/10) - Now, Mariah ended with a bang. This song is really nice and inspirational. I like how she has the choir and all on the track. Now she's trying to be all \\"Christian\\"...whatever. Even though she phony, this is a good track. <br /> <br />Overall Grade : B <br /> <br />P.S. ... Don't think I hate Mariah because I really don't. She's a good artist. If she wasn't so overrated, maybe I would like her even more.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|\\"Shaun of The Dead\\" is a very very funny and silly little comedy which is probably the first zombie movie in history that isn't horror. It's a horror comedy. That doesn't mean it's scary because it isn't. It's just like the \\"Beetlejuice\\" genre.<br /><br />Shaun and his roommate are slackers. While his roommate plays video games all day long, Shaun goes to the store and then he either goes back home, or goes to work. Little does he know after a while that zombies are roaming the streets of London and they are after Shaun and his friends and family, killing everyone in their paths. If Shaun doesn't destroy them, they'd kill every last one of them. Shaun only needs to find a way to fight back in funny ways. One of my favorite scenes is where they {Shaun and his friend} try to figure out what to throw at a female zombie that is in their yard. They try records, cricket bats, and all kinds of other things. That's already pretty much how things are with the rest of the movie and the plot is easy. It starts a little slow but gets gorier and funnier later on, especially in the final tavern scene with all of the zombies which is basically everybody in England except Shaun and the others. Highly recommended.
0156027321|4.0|This book is worth reading, simply because it is so original. As many other people said, it will make you laugh and cry, but that is because it has a very real human essence running through it. The end of the book disappointed some, but I think it was actually one of the best parts. It is all up to interpretation, but I think that if you read the very last line in the book, you will see that in the end, the magical journey really trumped \\"logical sense\\".
B00000DGUG|5.0|This album left me breathless! Alanis has done it again and personally i think this is better than her first, it never leaves my radio! My favorite songs are, Front row, Sympathetic Character, thank you, can't not, joinng you, i was hoping, would not come, one and that i would be good. All songs are over 10 stars! Keep it up Alanis!

B0002XVQNU|3.0|Daredevil, the Director's Cut should satisfy every action hero buff, except for one thing: <br />no charisma. Smoldering away in a stew of hatred and revenge, he is not <br />someone you'd care to invite for dinner. Some may take a liking to his illegally punishing <br />hoodlums, all ethics aside. Civic minded citizens, however, will no doubt naysay his shooting the defendants <br />he prosecutes when losing the case. As far as brooding is concerned, the same argument might be made against  <br />Batman--- except that Batman does not kill his enemies outright. Besides, he is much more engaging when not <br />wrapped up in his alter ego. Outside of the flagrant flaw described, the movie is a fast paced, visual delight, to <br />be taken with generous helpings of popcorn.
B000AA305M|5.0|Wow - I've listened to this powerful piece of work about ten times already and I am just thrilled. The polished orchestra/strings just enhance the already beautiful voice of David. The lyrics alone are so gripping - reminds me of Bernie Taupin. Slow Motion really sends me into another realm - and with two toddlers, a hubby, six cats and a dog - it's a welcome escape. Enjoy this journey - I do.
0060723513|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for a friend. I read this book some years ago and still think about the travels of the woman in the book. The book is written so that you feel that you are there with the aboriginal people and the life that they led. Complete with a few life lessons.
0060977493|5.0|Never do I put up Book Reviews on Amazon, nor do I have time to. However, After reading The God of Small Things, I felt compelled to. I've never experienced a novel so rich with imagery and sensual with metaphor as with Arundhati's first novel. I consider Roy one of the greatest writer's of our time - hands down!
B000002NJS|5.0|Produced with William Orbit, 1998's \\"Ray Of Light\\" was a watershed album for Madonna. The March release debuted at #2 in the US (stuck behind the \\"Titanic\\" soundtrack) and at #1 around the world. It garnered six Grammy nominations (including album and record of the year) and nine MTV Video Music Award nods. Madonna took home the best pop album, dance recording and short form music video Grammy awards. The album's art director, Kevin Reagan also took home a trophy for best recording package. Madonna also picked up six MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Female Video and Best Video of the Year (both for \\"Ray Of Light\\"). The set was a spectacular success chart-wise, with five international hit singles. \\"Frozen\\" climbed to #2 in the US and became her first UK #1 in eight years. The title track debuted at #5 on the Hot 100 in the US (her highest debut ever) and went to #2 in the UK. Three more UK top tens followed: \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\" (#10), \\"The Power Of Good-bye\\" (#6) and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" (#7). The latter two reached #11 and #93 in the US, respectively. \\"Ray Of Light\\" has sold over 4 million units in the US, and another 10 million outside America.     1. \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\" (10/10)  2. \\"Swim\\" (10/10)  3. \\"Ray Of Light\\" (10/10)  4. \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\" (10/10)  5. \\"Skin\\" (10/10)  6. \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" (10/10)  7. \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" (10/10)  8. \\"Shanti/Ashtangi\\" (9/10)  9. \\"Frozen\\" (10/10)  10. \\"The Power Of Good-Bye\\" (10/10)  11. \\"To Have And Not To Hold\\" (10/10)  12. \\"Little Star\\" (10/10)  13. \\"Mer Girl\\" (10/10)    I don't consider Ray Of Light to be one of Madonna's best albums, but it's still brilliant and a stunning masterpeice. From the opening track \\"Drowned World\\" to the last track which is haunting, \\"Mer Girl\\", the album is just fantastic. Even track eight is good, even though it's in a different language! All of the singles are just excellent, especially \\"Nothing Really Matters\\", a very good choice for single release. \\"Ray Of Light\\" and \\"Frozen\\" are also fantastic, and \\"The Power Of Good-Bye\\" and \\"Drowned World\\" are also good. The last track, however, is the best one. \\"Mer Girl\\" is a haunting song about Madonna's mother's death, and it takes her about 10 seconds to say each line. Yes, talk, not sing! Overall, I recommend \\"Ray Of Light\\" totally, to all you Madonna fans out there!     My top three \\"Ray Of Light\\" pics:-  3) Ray Of Light  2) Nothing Really Matters  1) Mer Girl
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Damn good movie with a great cast. Christina Bale IS Batman and Gary Oldman (I am a HUGE fan) breathes life into the Commissioner Gordon character. I can not wait for the sequel!
1878424319|5.0|As said in the above title, if everyone would practice the  <br />Four Agreements so many misunderstandings, resentments and dramas <br />would be avoided in each others life, a book that every individual should read, i have my copy in my purse, just to be reminded of the Four Agreements when i have a challenging day.  <br />
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I love all 4 of these movies (yes, even the fourth - I like campy, sue me). So I was very tempted to buy the Batman Legacy. However, after getting the Alien Legacy and then shelling out two years later for the Alien Quadrilogy box, I knew better. I knew that this Legacy would also eventually be made obsolete by some new uber-special-enhanced whatever box, so I did the smart thing and didn't buy the Batman Legacy. And now, after all this waiting, my patience is rewarded! True, this box set does follow Trek-box logic, meaning that it's just a compilation of individually released two-disc special editions, and contains nothing unique. But the same could be said of the Lord of the Rings uber-boxset, so this isn't exactly cause for complaint. And for those of you complaining about Batman begins... just remember that Begins is part of a NEW trilogy, which will have its OWN uber-boxset in a few years, and there's a very tiny chance that movies from the two distinct continuities will ever be mixed in one box.

B000AM4PBS|5.0|As a huge Friends fan, my DVD's are pretty worn out at this point, and a few have mysteriously vanished. I look forward to buying the new collector's set and, in particular, the trivia game coming out the same day and passing my old sets on to someone else who can't afford them.<br /><br />So stop whining and putting lame reviews on here (especially with pseudo-curse words and poor spelling). Get the collector's box from Warner Bros. when it's made available. You're not missing out on anything.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Well, i didn't play FF7 just because i missed it when it came out. <br />When i got my ps2 i played FFX and after that became a FF fanatic and went crazy. <br />It was then i saw the first trailer made to intrdouce what suposed to be a 10 minute movie for the FF7 fans. <br />After 2 years the movie which is 1:40 hours long came out and i was lucky enough to get my hands on a copy. <br /> <br />First i read a full plot for FF7 since i needed to know the details... <br />i knew that sephiroth was evil and cloud had cool hair, but i never really tried and listen to this amazing plot. <br />and when i did i was a goner... it is simply an amazing plot. <br />I was so anxoius to see the movie and to continue this tale of death, life and my favourite hero ; Cloud. <br /> <br />Graphics - <br />I saw the first Final Fantasy : Spirts within (even that it sucked) <br />which had such amazing graphics, for the time it came out it was purely amazing seeing such a work of art. <br />FF7:AC dosne't fall short on the graphics, the graphics are even better then FF:SW, lighting, Hi-res textures, models seem so realistic sometimes it just an amazing thing to see. <br />It certinly gets a 5 out of 5. <br /> <br />Audio -  <br />I loved \\"One Winged Angel\\" which came with FF7 OST and ofcourse been present in FF7, <br />The music in AC in one word are... well... there isn't a word good enough to express my feeling for the music, the Sound track is based on old audio from the game which the remasterd and updated, songs such as One Winged Angel which you could'nt belive can get any better just did, the guitars combined with the amazing voices and the fine music more the fits the movie's speed it also makes a great music to hear outside of the movie, i certinly going to buy the ost asap. <br />I give the sound and audio a 5 out of 5. <br /> <br />Story - <br />One word, a-mamsdmdasmdasm-zing. <br />i can't spoil it and i won't so it gets a 5 out of 5. <br /> <br />Downside - <br />Only forfans, sorry really cool CG guys, this fits only to those who know the story better than they know theier girlfriends (which is sad but apprently true) <br /> <br /> <br />Final words -  <br />A great and very good movie, a must see for FF7 fans and a rent for action jukies or anyone else. <br />BUT IT!.
B00005U122|5.0|Roger proves once again \\"which one's Pink\\". I was thrilled to hear that the boys didnt get along that well at Live 8, because if there is going to be a tour of Floydians I much prefer the bands Roger puts together....and Ive seen over 50 Floyd/exFloyd concerts, including this one. The concert is faithfully reproduced with outstanding sound and video. <br /> <br />The choice of Doyle Bramhall II to lead Gilmour's parts with stalwart Snowy White was brilliant. He adds amazing technical ability and soul to Gilmour's searing emotion. <br /> <br />Its one of two concert videos I dont bother to put away because I'll want it out soon enough.(the other is Steely Dans Two Against Nature.)
0061020710|5.0|The discworld series is about Irony. Having read other books in this series I went back to the start and decided to go all the way thought and enjoy every step (or revolution) in the progress of the Discworld. It's ironic, it's witty, it's insightful at times and it's easy to laugh at. High recommendation.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|I've been a fan of Dream Theater for some time, I started by byying the \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" DVD, I was amazed, then I got this awsome DVD in my hands, what's the result?? One of the best concert shows I've ever seen <br />The setlist, although long, it's not even close to \\"boring\\" <br />Starting the show with one of Train of Thought's best \\"As I Am\\" <br />The Dream Team goes out in a musical parade, full of solos, full of magic. <br />I like every aspect of this DVD, but I still don't manage to get LaBrie's voice live. Sometimes he gives the song this \\"uauauaua\\" effect that I'm not very fond with. Although he does have a nice voice, he can still get better to sing live. <br />In studio he sounds great, but in live performance he can't get better, but that doesn't tell LaBrie is a bad singer, he is good, he is charismatic, he plays with the audience, he uses his mind and spirit into his singing. That's why I rate this DVD 5 stars (not counting that DT's Musicianship is better than ever) <br />1. As I Am: A powerful opener, the audience cheer the Dream Team as they make the appeareance in the Budokan, James LaBrie's voice sounds good here. DT tells us with this that this show is for real. <br /> <br />2. This Dying Soul: A Heavy opening, LaBrie's not so bad here. Excellent song to be performed on live, at the final part, when Myung, Petrucci and Rudess strike at the same time, I was in shock. <br /> <br />3.Beyond this Life: Very similar to \\"Live Scenes from New York\\" version, with exception that this one has an almost 7 minute extended solo, guitars, keyboards, bass guitar and drums. Inspiring <br /> <br />4. Hollow Years: Amazing song! In live it sounds just great, the beginning, Jordan Rudess and Petrucci hit first. LaBrie's vocals in this song are top-notch. It's very relaxing, and sounds much better than the studio version. <br /> <br />5. War Inside My Head: Mortal! The concert starts gaining some heavyness with this one, part of Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. Musicanship is excellent, LaBrie's vocals, although not as good as in Hollow Years, still manages to be in line with the song, but this is just an opener <br /> <br />6. The Test that Stumped them All: Well, this is a crazy song!! The keyboard-guitar intro is just...well, not human. <br />I love Portnoy's crazy drumming here. Every one's top-notch here, great concert song. <br /> <br />7. Endless Sacrifice: Such a great song, vocals are great, but LaBrie's voice is not as good as it was before. He efforts to keep up with the song. Rudess and Petrucci, Hail o' great gods. <br /> <br />8. Instrumedly: This is what I talk about being \\"True Musicanship\\" A combination of DT's best instrumentals equal power, inspiration, did I mention power?? Everyone has crazy and complex lines. I love when Rudess plays his funny piano lines in \\"Merry Melodies\\" And with a majestic finale of \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" this is one of the best in the show. <br /> <br />9.Trial of Tears: The Falling Into Infinity grand-song. It really sounds great in here. Rudess managed to play it wonderfully, LaBrie sounds more rested, but he can still improve, although, he sounds great. <br /> <br />10. New Millennium: Not a song I like very much, but it's not so bad, I like the bizarre Chapman stick Myung plays in this one. <br /> <br />11. Keyboard Solo: LaBrie's words \\"Ladies and Gentlemen...this is Jordan Rudess!!!\\" tells us here he comes!!! the unstoppable beast, the key wizard, the immortal keyboard player. He starts with some techo-sounding solo, but then shifting into a more oriental based rythm. Japan should be very glad here. He manages to make a crazy solo using oriental-influenced sounds, Great Work Jordan! <br /> <br />12. Only a Matter of Time: After Jordan's jaw-dropping solo the full band enters stage again to play this song. It sounds great, LaBrie's singing is not bad. <br /> <br />13. Goodnight Kiss: God I love this song, LaBrie darling, can't you sing always like you do here?? His singing here is so emotional. <br />I love the concept of this song, although the title may same something lovely, the lyrics are much much darker. <br />Petrucci's \\"Main theme 6DOIT\\" is very emotional as well <br /> <br />14. Solitary Shell: Another fragment of 42 minute opus- Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. Petrucci enters scene with his double guitar. LaBrie's voice can improve. I like this song very much. <br /> <br />15. Stream of Consciousness: The Instrumedly and this song, 2 instrumental bombs. Jordan's keyboard, petrucci's guitar, Portnoy's drums and Myung's bass are at full strength here. <br /> <br />16. Disappear: This live version sounds much more better than the studio version. This song is really awe-inspirin, the Dream Team are still at full strength. <br /> <br />17. Pull Me Under: A Classic!!! Very well played, although being the only Images and Words song played, it fits great in the setlist. Oh my god!! Portnoy is a madful drumful doomful beast!! <br /> <br />18. In the Name of God: The majestic Grand Finale. This song is really majestic, with a really crazy guitar solo and great orquestration by Rudess. The concert ends with this one... <br /> <br />This was an all-round concert, soft songs, heavy songs, speed songs...this guys are the best...and they just keep getting better and better... <br />
B00003XB8K|5.0|After seeing the videos for these two songs it makes them that much better, they are great songs! The videos are really cool and unique. Screen Behind the Mirror is Enigmas best and I pretty much knew this after one listen, they are not trying to relax you as much anymore and yet they still do, but now they just plane rock! They are like a New Age/Electronic/Rock band on this album. The use of Carmina Burana is pretty awesome, a very classic epic sounding classical piece. What could be more epic then it in all of musical history? Used in movie trailers and sports highlights and more! Enigma borrows it with a cool style.<br /><br />\\"The Gate\\" is a fine opening for Enigma and it leads into the really awesome \\"Push the Limits\\"(Great video). \\"Gravity of Love\\" Very epic and intense at times, one of the bands best songs and videos. \\"Modern Crusaders\\" is my least favorite song, not huge on the male vocals in the band and the lyrics aren't that special. \\"Smell of Desire\\" nice and relaxing. This is one band that really does help me feel calm. \\"Traces (Light and Weight)\\" Another relaxing and cool song. \\"The Screen Behind the Mirror\\" is an interesting mix of another song into a new. \\"Endless Quest\\" is a nicely moving song. \\"Camera Obscura\\" a filler, but good. \\"Between Mind and Heart\\" Yet another moving and relaxing song. \\"Silence Must Be Heard\\" Great ending song to Enigmas best album. You don't really hear this band anymore, which is a shame, they got even better near the end, because they made a great album here and I think this one will stand the test of time more then their other albums, because it has a really cool sound to it that will fit right in with the future of music to come.
B00000I07P|1.0|Anyways, in 1986 of course we had classics like Reign in Blood, Master of Puppets, Peace Sells, Darkness Descends and Pleasure to Kill. However we had also garbage at the same year. Europe's Final Countdown, Ratt's Dancing Undercover, Judas Priest sold out with Turbo, Poison had that godawful Look What the Cat Dragged In etc. And those albums were bad enough, but Slipery When Wet is beyond that. It was the main reason why hair-metal started to suck in the late 80's. This is just as bad as BJ's new stuff but I hate this at most cuz this his their most irritatingly overrated album. But still it's so awful it makes Nevermind by Nirvana sound like The Number of the Beast by Iron Maiden. Jon Bon Jovi is a horrible singer and he can't write lyrics even if his life depends on it. He does stupid screams in his \\"heavier\\" songs ('You Give Love A Bad Name', 'Let It Rock'), and he writes cheesy stuff ('Livin' On A Prayer', 'I'd Die For You'). And the rest band is mediocre also. Richie Sambora (guitarist) is completely overrated. His riffs are standart and his solos are repetitive, this guy can't hold a candle to Adrian Smith, John Petrucci or K.K. Downing. The bassist and the drummer are nothing special either. The worst part is the vocals but there is nothing good here at all.    I don't say hair metal is all bad, for good stuuf of this kind listen to Guns N Roses, Scorpions, Montley Crue, Van Halen and Skid Row, but it just has too many garbage bands like Bon Jovi (which is by far the worst). For good metal in general listen to Iron Maiden, Judas Priest (either 'Stained Class' or 'Defenders of the Faith' will be the best place to start, AVOID that 'Turbo' cra p), Queensryche, Slayer, Megadeth, 80's Metallica, Dream Theater, Sepultura, Death, Suffocation, Black Sabbath, Pantera, Celtic Frost, Venom, Dark Angel and Kreator.    Hate me for this review but someone had to say this. Actually when I come to think at it, this is the worst album of the 80's. Hell, even all that cheesy80's pop stuff like Tina Turner was better than this pile of dogs hit.    DEATH TO BON JOVI!!    (BTW it's an updated review: July 23, 2006)
034544678X|5.0|This book is terrific.  A friend recommended it, and my daughter said that she reads mostly novels and didn't really need the book.  The next time I was at her house, she was telling me some good things she had found out from the book!
B00004XQP4|5.0|This is such a good but weird album. I say its weird because its not what you expect from them. They surprised a lot of people from this album. Its not like their old stuff, but its sound and beats just make you like it. When you get this CD, make sure you have about 40 - 45 mins. to listen to Green Day. Listen to the entire album and you will know what I mean. Green Day has matured a lot in this album. They're are no longer insane drinking and smoking teens. The lyrics are a lot different. THIS IS A MUST BUY!!!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM!!!!!! <br /> <br />Listen to Misery, #5. Its like you want to turn it off but you can't.
0895260131|1.0|A great book .<br /><br />Why one star? because it is intended to be a serious and thought provoking book. Pleasure for the weak minded perhaps, but it read more like a parody created by the Daily Show.<br /><br />It's a great book for those who already hate Islam and want to feed that hatred with what gold diggers are willing to provide for the challenged minds in a flourishing market of Islamophobia.<br /><br />A hideous propaganda, I am embarrassed for those that read it and found its horrible twisting of current and historical fact as a rationale for determining the direction our country needs to go. It is sad that more than half of our nation's discourse is provided by Rush Limbaugh dittoheads and Al Franken clones.<br /><br />For any intelligent and well read individual, enjoy the unintended joke. For any truth seeker, read books by Academia people.
B000002N2P|5.0|This is probably in my top 3 favorites when it comes to Green Day. This album got not enough credit. When people think of Green Day, they think of Dookie, and American Idiot. I'm not like that. This album is not as good as Dookie (which I also give 5 stars to because its my favorite). It sounds different, but it still is soooooooo good. Because it sounds different does NOT mean you shouldn't buy this album. If you buy this CD you will most likely agree with me

B00005ASHM|5.0|I must admit, as someone who was not a real fan of The Beach Boys, I always considered themselves to be a \\"Fun in the Sun\\" type of band.   However, as I became intrigued by The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hears Club Band\\" album, I soon became equally intrigued by The Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\".  I soon learned that there was a bit of a rivalry that existed between the Beatles and the Beach Boys' from a creative standpoint.  It turns out that when the Beatles released \\"Rubber Soul\\", Brian Wilson felt compelled to push himself to the creative max - and the result would be \\"Pet Sounds\\" - which in turn inspired the Beatles to do \\"Sgt Pepper\\".   With \\"Pet Sounds\\", I discovered was an album that wasn't the typical Beach Boys' \\"Fun in the Sun\\", but an album that would prove to be one of complex instrumentation and be years ahead of its time.   This would be the result of the efforts of Brian Wilson - with some songwriting help from Tony Asher. <br /> <br />Wilson incorporates probably one of the widest ranges of instruments that had been heard on any album in the Rock era.  This includes Strings, Woodwinds, Brass, and a variety of percussion and interesting sounds (bicycle bells, dog barking, etc).   If one is to basically compare \\"Sgt Pepper\\" against \\"Pet Sounds\\", \\"Sgt Pepper\\" may have stronger and more catchy lyrics, but Wilson's musical arrangements on \\"Pet Sounds\\" have the slight edge.    For all practical purposes, Wilson incorporates a four piece orchestra for many parts of this collection.   Two instruments that really stand out on this collection are the use of Tympani Drums and Baritone Saxophone <br /> <br />One thing that makes this collection so unique is you get two flavors of \\"Pet Sounds\\".   The first 13 tracks are the original tracks as they were recorded back in 1966 and released in mono.    In 1997, Brian Wilson would take those original masters from 1966 and create a Stereo version of those tracks - which are also included on this collection.  This basically is a win-win for the listener.  I found that I would appreciate the charm and originality of the mono recordings while I could also appreciate how well these tracks sounded when converted to Stereo.  Each version brings a different listening experience. You will hear a little more distortion with the mono version, but that is to be expected.   There is also a bonus track that was not included on the 1966 release called - \\"Hang On to Your Ego\\". <br /> <br />Here is a quick synopsis of the tracks: <br /> <br />\\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\": This is one of the more popular tracks.  It has the classic Beach Boys' harmonies.    This song is enhanced by the use of Tympani, Saxophones, and Mandolins <br /> <br />\\"You Still Believe in Me\\":  Slight psychedelic feel.  The use of bicycle horns gives this song some charm.   The music from the Harpsichord,  Clarinet, and Tympani are some of the highlights here. <br /> <br />\\"That's Not Me\\": Not a bad song.  Mike Love does a good job on vocals here and Glen Campbell contributes 12 string guitar. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\\":  A gentle song highlighted by gentle vocals by Brian.  Even the use of the Tympani is softer here.  Nice string arrangements here. <br /> <br />\\"I'm Waiting for the Day\\":  This sounds like a cross between psychedelic and Hawaiian sounds.  The Tympanis and Bongos sound great here, but also Ukulele, Flute, and English Horns sound good as well - all will really give this a terrific sound <br /> <br />\\"Lets Go Away\\": I never thought of the Beach Boys as an instrumental group, but \\"Pet Sounds\\" gives us two instrumentals.  This one has a nice soft classical music feel to it. <br /> <br />\\"Sloop John B\\": Here Brian rearranges a cover of this traditional song.   There is a bit of Doo-Wop in here.   The Baritone Saxophone is used well here.   Brian and Mike do a great job sharing lead vocals. <br /> <br />\\"God Only Knows\\": Paul McCartney still calls this one of the greatest songs he ever heard- and with good reason.   This song is perfection.  Carl Wilson gets the nod to lead the vocals here and doesn't let anyone down.   The French Horns, Baritone Sax, Clarinet, and String Ensemble really help as well.  This song is lyrically very strong and probably the best song done by the Beach Boys. <br /> <br />\\"I Know There's An Answer\\":  Mike and Alan Jardine share vocals here.   Some more strong lyrics.  More of a Doo Wop sound and more terrific Baritone Sax work. <br /> <br />\\"Here Today\\":  Great horn arrangements highlight this song - especially the Baritone Sax <br /> <br />\\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\\": Lots of interesting percussion sounds on here.  The Tympani and Baritone Sax stand out here again. <br /> <br />\\"Pet Sounds\\": The title track and another instrumental.  Wilson admits to this having a James Bond psychedelic sound.  More Baritone Sax and Percussions <br /> <br />\\"Caroline Ho\\":  The train sound and the sounds of Brian's dogs barking at the end of this song are most remembered.   There is some nice Ukulele on this song.  Brian does a great job on the lead vocals, but great harmonies by the Beach Boys. <br /> <br />\\"Hang On To Your Ego\\": This is the bonus track.  Baritone Sax is the highlight here again.  However, Brian's vocals might be the strongest of any track on this album. <br /> <br />The liner notes are incredible.  You get a short \\"letter\\" from Brian Wilson about his perspectives on \\"Pet Sounds\\".  David Leaf has a two terrific write-ups - one is more of a biographical point of view of \\"Pet Sounds\\" while the other talks about the making of the \\"Pet Sounds\\" album.    There are track by track notes that include commentary by Brian.  You also get a Sessionography of all of the participating musicians in \\"Pet Sounds\\".  \\"Pet Sounds\\" might not be the best selling album in history, but it most certainly merits its place in music history.  Highly recommended.
B000AL730Y|5.0|This time Paul is serious.  By that I mean, this not an upbeat Pop album or a collection of \\"Silly Love Songs.\\"  And that's meant as a compliment.  When Paul was in the Beatles, the creative competition & tension between him & John pushed him to create an amazing collection of timeless tunes.  By contrast, though, Paul's solo efforts, often devoid of that creative competition, frequently have come off as trifling or half-baked.  Seemingly, creating music comes so easily to McCartney that one often gets the impression that he doesn't try very hard unless pushed.  Fortunately, someone pushed him during the creation of his new album.  The much needed goading came from Nigel Godrich (Radiohead, Travis & Beck), who was recommended to Paul by George Martin.  What Paul has delivered is a serious artistic vision that is at times more melancholy, introspective & darker in tone than anything he's ever released before.  However, the album, overall, is positive & hopeful.  Ever tuneful, lyrics have often been the weak link in McCartney's music, but pleasantly, whether it comes from Nigel's cajoling or some other source, the lyrics on C&C are not an embarrassment, but for the most part well-written.  Paul is in fine voice with some of his most heartfelt, expressive singing ever.  While he retains his remarkable vocal range, even in the upper register, there's a noticeable patina of age that nicely compliments the elder statesman feel conveyed both in the exceptional craftsmanship of the music & maturity of the lyrics.  Think of some of the more \\"serious\\" songs Paul wrote with the Beatles - Yesterday, Eleanor Rigby, For No One, Blackbird, Let It Be - & you'll be better prepared for the mood & tone of his latest tome.  (And yes, these songs can hold up favorably in comparison with his Beatles catalog.)  As with those songs, this album gets most of its tonal coloration from piano, acoustic guitar & various combinations of orchestral strings.  Electric guitars, while used, are rarely to the fore.  What we have here is the mature work of one of our most accomplished & acclaimed tunesmiths in full command of his craft & in fine form, delivering one of the most solid works of his solo career.  Interestingly, this album seems to be drawing a definite love-it-or-hate-it reaction in Paul's considerable fan base, so you may want to preview it first to see if it's your cuppa \\"English Tea.\\" <br /> <br />A quick comment on the songs. <br /> <br />1. FINE LINE - The lead-off single & one of the most upbeat songs on the album, this has kind of a Hey Bulldog/Lady Madonna piano-driven feel to it.  This track walks a \\"fine line\\" between rocking out & middle-of-the-road.  If the drums were brought up more in the mix & some loud electric guitars were added, this song would rock as hard as those Beatle songs, too.  Gets the album off to a \\"fine\\" start. <br /> <br />2. HOW KIND OF YOU - A song about meeting his new wife, Heather, this has a somewhat unstructured, meandering feel to it, perhaps reflecting the daze Paul felt upon their first meeting. <br /> <br />3. JENNY WREN - McCartney has said he deliberately tried to write this as a \\"daughter\\" of Blackbird.  While I wouldn't say it's as stunning a beauty as its \\"mother,\\" it does bear a \\"family resemblance\\" whose loveliness is enhanced by the inspired use of the soulful, evocative tones of the duduk in the instrumental solo.  (The duduk is an ancient Armenian double-reed distant forerunner of the oboe.) <br /> <br />4. AT THE MERCY - Very different sounding song for Paul.  In an interview for Time magazine, Paul said, \\"When I write, there are times - not always - when I hear John in my head.\\"  I think this might have been one of those times as its melancholy, dark tone seems more in keeping with Lennon than with the usually \\"sunny\\" McCartney. <br /> <br />5. FRIENDS TO GO - A mid-tempo, very catchy tune displaying an unmistakable Harrison-esque quality.  My only complaint being that it's too short! <br /> <br/>6. ENGLISH TEA - A light-hearted, oh-so-British music hall delight that Paul pulls off with complete charm. <br /> <br />7. TOO MUCH RAIN - Another song haunted by Harrison.  This would make an excellent & moving choice for performance at one of the Katrina hurricane relief concerts. <br /> <br />8. A CERTAIN SOFTNESS - With a decided Spanish/Mediterranean feel, this is a bit different type of ballad for Paul, though it is somewhat reminiscent of And I Love Her.  A beautiful, moving love song. <br /> <br />9. RIDING TO VANITY FAIR - Unquestionably the most musically challenging song on the album.  This sounds unlike anything Paul has done before.  Over a simple, circular, trance-like track Paul delivers a somewhat oriental sounding melody.  Conveys a mystical, ethereal mood.  Even the lyrics deviate some from Paul's usually very linear style.  Gets my vote for \\"best lyrics.\\"  Riding to Vanity Fair turns out to be quite adventurous. <br /> <br />10. FOLLOW ME - For me, the weakest track on the album.  Not that it's bad or an embarrassment, but nothing distinguishes it, either.  Pleasant, but not memorable.  Interestingly, the only song on the album to use most of the members of his current touring band - Rusty Anderson, Abe Laboriel, jr & Brian Ray. <br /> <br />11. PROMISE TO YOU GIRL - Paul McCartney & Brian Wilson have had a mutual admiration society thing going for years, with Paul guesting on Brian's last solo album.  Here Paul pays tribute to Brian's influence with the vocal harmonies in this, the most raucous, rollicking track on the disc.  Piano-driven & decidedly Beatle-esque - a great romp. <br /> <br />12. THIS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE - A prime example of the kind of beautiful, tender love song that Paul is so deservedly famous for.  Nicely understated. <br /> <br />13. ANYWAY - The album ends with another excellent ballad.  Great use of dynamics.  From just a solo piano the song builds up to the end, then suddenly fades out without resolution, effectivelyconveying the unresolved yearning expressed in the lyrics.
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul McCartney is back with \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\", his first solo studio album since 2001's \\"Driving Rain\\". While most of Paul's recent solo material has been decent but spotty at times, \\"Chaos..\\" proves that McCartney has indeed returned to form as nearly every track on the album is on par with some of his most classic work.<br /><br />\\"Fine Line\\" and \\"Promise to You Girl\\" are both piano-driven rockers with trademark McCartney hooks while \\"Jenny Wren\\" and \\"English Tea\\" are derivitive of Beatle classics \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"For No One\\" respectively. There is even a slight George Harrison influence in the tracks \\"Friends to Go\\" and \\"Too Much Rain\\". The two closing tracks \\"This Never Happened Before\\" and \\"Anyway\\" rank among the best ballads that Paul has written in years, the latter sounding much like \\"Let It Be\\".<br /><br />Elsewhere on the album, Paul stretches out musicially on the mini-epic \\"How Kind Of You\\", \\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\" and \\"At The Mercy\\" which have a slightly different musical direction to them but are still unmistakeably McCartney. Even the untitled hidden instrumental track at the end of the CD shows that Paul is still not afraid to experiment with unusual sounds and musical ideas.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" offers no chaos but pure creation and is Paul McCartney's best album in years. The music is joyous and Paul's vocals show no sign of age whatsoever.<br /><br />The final verdict on \\"Chaos..\\": It's an instant classic and is Paul's best album of the new millenium.
0393317552|1.0|I think that the book is written for an older age of people, like a college history class, but i'm only a sophmore in high school and it is way to in depth for me and it is just not something that i like to read. if i were older i would probably give it a 4 star but it just doesn't appeal to my daughter who is a sophmore in high school.
B00005L8Y7|5.0|What is there left to be said about the greatness of this recording that hasn't already been said?  One of Coltrane's last works before his untimely death but a work worthy of tribute to it's subject, The Almighty Himself!  The liner notes says so much about Trane's faith and the music follows it up.  As for this disc, the Japanese did a great job remastering this so the sound is very good and the mini lp-sleeve packaging is very impressive to behold.  A good buy!
B0009S2T0M|4.0|It's a rarity nowadays to find a movie that would captivate you from beginning till the end.  This movie did exactly just that.  The setting was mostly grim, on a rainy day, in a cell, in a room with fluoro-green colour, on the top floor of an office building, and so forth.  It truly excelled in putting the audience on the edge and enabling the audience to feel the pain and grosteque that the people were going through.  The movie didn't intend to have the audience empathise or feeling sorry for the main character who was imprisoned for fifteen years.  Rather, we were more intrigued to find the cause of imprisonment.  Naturally, the ending was as disturbing as the movie was and it didn't disappoint.  If you  think that the ending would be the imprisoned main character gotten his final revenge from his captor, you would be hugely disappointed because the theme of this movie would be running off the tangent in every sense of the way.  When classical music was playing whilst the torture was going on, it gave this movie a haunting but lasting beauty that would imprint in audience's mind for many years to come.  By no means, I'm making a comparison here but if you have watched \\"Fight Club\\" before starring Norton and Pitt, you know what you are to expect from \\"Old Boy\\".  As a word of percaution, this movie is not for the faint-hearted.  I squirmed quite a few times in this instance.  Highly recommended and totally deserved the accolade that it gotten from the Cannes Festival two years before.
B000AARKOO|4.0|This movie did get a pan from critics and didn't do as well at the boxoffice as it should have as a result.  This was a good film!  If you are looking for a historically accurate representation of the crusades, look for documentaries.  This was a movie created for entertainment, not to present a balanced view of Christian and Muslim activities in Jerusalem.  Also remember, that with current anti-Islamic sentiments in the world, Ridley Scott was bound to face criticism for a movie which portrayed the Muslims in a more favorable light than the Christians. <br /> <br />No, I agree that Bloom was less than stellar in this and isn't really a broad enough presence to hold an epic film like this together on his own.  Luckily he didn't have to. The acting was exceptional from the supporting cast.  Neeson, Irons, Gleeson, and Thewlis kept this movie honest and stepped in to any gaps Bloom may have left.  By far the most amazing performance here was Edward Norton as the King of Jerusalem.  He is masked and his body covered completely and yet he manages with his eyes and voice to completely engage and win over the viewer.  He was astounding. <br /> <br />
B0009UC7H0|2.0|Ok, it wasn't totally boring or anything, but gee, with that big of a budget and the big names involved 'ya think they could have made it a great action adventure thriller.<br /><br />It could have been Raiders of the Lost Ark, instead it was Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.<br /><br />I've never read any of the books, I hear they are fun, I'm sure fans of Clusser are probably the most disappointed with this flick and I know I was disappointed with the film just based upon my expectation of what it was supposed to be.<br /><br />I'd definately recommend renting this one before buying it, I can't see watching a cheesy movie twice when the action is so mundane.
B000AL730O|5.0|Thank you Paul, you have gone back to your roots.  I am a die hard Beatles fan and this cd shows what a great song writer Paul is.  I believe Paul and John Lennon were and are the best song writers ever in the era of rock & roll and pop music.  Every song on this cd makes you think of someone or something in your own life.  Listen to the message in the song \\"To Much Rain\\". The more I play the cd, the more I love it.
B0009MAO46|5.0|I love this movie. Ever since the young age, I loved it. Being the 1st Digital movie, this deserves to be put in top 100 best movies ever. Woody, Buzz, Mr.Potatoe Head, ect. I love them all. 10 years already huh? Wow. The extras are amazing and this is when Pixar made some good movies. Toy Story 2 comes out DEC.26th AND Toy Story 3 will go into production after the finish Cars!
0425205061|5.0|Another outstanding Jack Reacher book.  Great charactor with real life failing, emotions, and action.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Writer/producer Charlie Kaufman is a genius.  \\"Being John Malkovich,\\" \\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,\\" \\"Human Nature\\" and \\"Adaptation\\" are among the most original films of the past decade.  \\"Eternal Sunshine...\\" is simply audacious (Kaufman won the Oscar for it).  Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are the best they've ever been (which, where Winslet is concerned, is really saying something).  The supporting cast is excellent.<br /><br />I'm not going to blather on and on.  Simply, this would have had my vote for Best Picture of 2004 - and Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay.  This film, like all of Kaufman's previous efforts is full of wit, imagination and originality - his films are ALIVE - they require that you bring your mind to the movie thaetre - THINKING IS REQUIRED!  I love that.
B00005V4O5|5.0|I just got introduced to this CD several months ago. I wasn't prepared for this style and delivery of progressive rock, but there were some immediate gems on it. After a few more listens, I started to actually hear the lyrics and understood the theme, which is somewhat conveluted upon the first few listens. I must say that I now 'get' the hype surrounding this release. <br /> <br />Yes, this band has chops, which is good, but not the important element here. Yes, this is musically challenging prog, complete with rapid time signature shifts and multi-movement songs, but that's only sauce for the goose. The writing is stellar, and the focus is on the story, not prog for prog's sake. I can't tell you how stunned I was when I realized what the theme behind the excellent track Trace Of Blood was about the miscarriage of a pregnancy. But this is indicative of the type of writing you get here. No, this isn't an upbeat album by any means, but even a heavy song like Trace Of Blood is followed by the tender This Heart Of Mine (I pledge), which is the male character reafirming his love for his wife, who had just miscarried. Same with another ballad Second Love, which deals with loss as well.  <br /> <br />Once you've listened to this album 6 or 7 times through, you can get goosebumps on some tracks. One of the instrumentals on this album, Dryad Of The Woods, is transcendant. Its as lovely as any instrumental you've heard from any genre. Quite unexpected since this album is really edgy and full blown metal in places. And the themes are heavy, dealing with attempted suicide (Rope Ends) and depression (Undertow), so I wouldn't call it a romantic album.  <br /> <br />It was a fun listen the first few times through because this album really rocks in places, like the songs Rope Ends, Waking Every God, and the aforementioned Trace Of Blood, which is a terrific rock fest, even if the theme is miscarriage. In the song Trace Of Blood, he is bidding farewell to the child he'll never know,citing \\"I'll never know your name but I will love you just the same\\", so the raucus, angry nature of the song is due to the fact that all the hope and preperation of becoming a dad has culminated in a \\"trace of blood\\", which isn't how he'd want to remember his unborn child. <br /> <br />See, pretty heady stuff. And its handled very deftly. It dosen't come across as exploitive or pretencious; rather like the writer or someone he knew had unfortunately lived such an experience.  <br /> <br />I'll definately be checking out this band's other albums in the future.  Highly recommended.
0739313126|5.0|It's hard to explain why there's been such a fuss over this novel. Sure, it digs the Christian religion's grave just a bit more, but c'mon, it's only a novel. It's fiction. That MEEEEAANS....it's FALSE! It's not true, it's fake! If you buy a work of fiction looking for concrete facts, get a head check. Nobody's saying there's absolutely nothing true in this book, but it's not a history book, it's a suspense novel.<br /><br />However. I loved this book, because it makes history (false or not) very VERY interesting. I seriously couldn't put my iPod down, and that's what's so great about this novel (NOVEL!), it's about history and the church, but it's actually interesting. With the anti-book revolution today, people need to be praising Dan Brown for writing a thick book that everyone has read. Bravo.<br /><br />I'm done with my rant/ramble. I hope this helped. Praise da Vinci!
B00092ZMDY|4.0|BEEN WITH THE EAGLES AND THEIR HITS IN LPS, CDS, LDS, DVDS  <br />( NEARLY ALL TITLES ) FOR 30 YEARS.  THIS DVD SOUNDS SUPERB IN DTS.  THE RECORDING TECHNOLOGY HAS REACHED A NEW FRONTIER FOR THE DISC : DYNAMIC, DEFINITIONS, DEPTH AND IMAGES OF THE MUSICAL <br />INSTRUMENTS ARE ALL THERE.  THE FOUNDATIONAL MEMBERS ALWAYS PERFORM THE BEST EVEN THE VOICES NEVER BEING AFFECTED BY AGES AND YEARS.  YES, WHERE IS DON FELDER ???  THAT IS WHY I GRADE THIS DISC 4 STARS.  MY COMMENTS ARE: <br /> <br />1.  THE REPLACED LEAD GUITARIST IS HARDLY COMPARED WITH DON <br />    OBVIOUSLY IN \\" I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY \\" ENDING GUITAR SOLOS. <br /> <br />2.  DON HENLEY'S DRUM BEATS IN \\" I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY \\" WAS <br />    DULL IN SOUNDING.  WRONG IN TUNE OR CHEAP BRAND DRUMS SET ? <br /> <br />3.  95' HELL FREEZE OVER HAD GOT A TEAM OF ORCHESTRA FOR BACK- <br />    GROUND MUSIC SUPPORT PRODUCING A SMOOTH CREAMY MUSIC EFFECT <br />    BUT THIS CONCERT ADDED SEVERAL SAXOPHONE AND TRUMPET PLAYERS <br />    WHO SPOILED THE SPIRIT OF EAGLES MUSIC BY BRINGING TOO MUCH  <br />    NOISE COVERING ALL GUITAR SOLOS AT END OF HOTEL CALIFORNIA. <br />    AFTER ALL THEY WERE UNNECESSARY TO BE ADDED. <br /> <br />4.  THE REPLACED GUITARIST SHOULD HAVE USED FENDER'S THAN  <br />    GIBSON'S IN SOME OF THE HITS. <br /> <br />ANYWAY, THIS DVD IS A MUST HAVE FOR EVERYBODY.

B000006TRV|5.0|I think most people underappreciate(spelled right?)I love this album. Its's awasome. Hey thats just my opinion but it's better than the sorry excuse for rock we have today. I dont see cold play or fat ass joe writing anything better.
B00007AJF8|5.0|Can't believe that this didn't win the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (and I loved \\"American Beauty\\").  The fact is this should have won Best Picture.  Spike Jones has directed a brilliant script by Charlie Kaufman.  John Cusack (so great in \\"The Grifters\\" and \\"Bullets Over Broadway\\") gives his finest performance here.  John Malkovich and Catherine Keener deliver great performances - inventive and fesh - Malkovich is one of the greats - Keener a revelation.  Cameron Diaz (never a favorite) proves herself a considerable actress.  The editing, art direction, sound and score are all terrific.  The last great film of the twentieth century?  Certainly the best film of 1999.  Beware:  Thinking required.
0316168815|5.0|Hearbreakingly beautiful. The author shows great skill in her balance between narrative, dialogue and backstory. The characters are chillingly alive.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I hate to admit this, but Batman Begins has just replaced Superman the Movie as the greatest comic book movie of all time.  This is saying something.  Superman set the bar for storytelling and special effects in movies.  And until now, only two could ever have rivialed it, the two X-Men films.  I know there are Spider-man fans out there who feel that those two were the greatest, (and I think they're good) but they just don't compare to Superman, Batman, X-Men and X-2. <br /> <br />When I walked into Batman Begins, I was somewhat nervous about the film.  The Batman films from the ninties just weren't up to par and I felt this one could fall into the same trap.  But I was wrong.  The film starts off strong by showing that this was no prequel.  Thank goodness.  It is it's own start to a series of it's own. <br /> <br />The story is compelling from the start.  Bruce Wayne tourtured self is found in a Chinese prison camp, shutting himself in with criminals to fight them.  He is then released and finds himself mentored by Liam Nieson and the League of Shadows.  I won't give anymore away to the film, except to say that every single person gives awsome performences and the story allows us to show that Batman this time is not out for revenge as he was in the previous four films, but he is out for justice.  And the action is top notch.  I only hope the sequels will be half as good.
068987474X|5.0|He's Just Not That Into You was a great read. It was fun and very informative.
0452282152|4.0|Tracy Chevalier unpacks the mystery behind the Vermeer painting \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" in her novel of the same title. Griet, the 16-year-old girl in the painting, is a maid in the Vermeer household. Her father was a dutch tile painter who was blinded when his kiln exploded in front of him. In order to feed her family, Griet becomes a maid in the Vermeer house. From the moment young Griet meets the mysterious painter, there is a connection between them; a connection of veiled sensuality and vague longing. A wealthy client of Vermeer's is equally taken with Griet and demands that Vermeer paint her. Resistant at first, Vermeer finally paints Griet in a fashion he had never done before. However, this simple role of model threatens to ruin Griet forever.<br /><br />Tracy Chevalier did a tremendous job with this novel. It was captivating and beautiful, intelligent and entertaining. It was not a terribly deep work, but that is just fine. The reader does feel a strong connection to the narrator, Griet, and her struggle with family, sexuality, and her place in the world of 1664.  Chevalier draws in the reader with her beautiful details and rich setting. This is an elegant and intriguing novel that I highly recommend.
0553277472|5.0|this book is great, the writer truely has an interesting perspective on the world. it is truely original, and makes you look at things in new ways. <br />its great, i recoment you BUY IT!
B000BCKFWK|4.0|How very sad the way studios try to increase profits on movies by releasing and then rereleasing with more extras, more footage, ect. <br /> <br />I have been waiting for Sin City to come out for purchase since I saw it in theaters. This is how movies based on graphic novels should be shot. So the original literature comes to life. Not in a cheap knockoff movie that only loosly follows the source material like other films. I only wish \\"V for Vendetta\\" was being done with the respect to the original style and vision Sin City was. That is a fantastic graphic novel and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br />Anyway, I feel sorry for everyone who bought the first version, they'll have a harder time reselling it after this expanded one comes out. But really, this move was so obvious. The origianl version has such a short list of DVD extras (almost none) that everyone should have known another version would be coming out, so I didn't buy the original. This is EXACTLY what happened with Pulp Fiction, and today you can't even find the original DVD release in video rental, they only carry the \\"Collector's Edition\\".
B000068FWC|5.0|Breakfast in America, for those of us who grew up hearing its many singles on the radio, is a timeless, catchy, flawlessly produced pop confection with an intelligent, cynical edge, much like Steely Dan's records of the same period (Gaucho and Aja).  Other pop masterpieces released in the same year: Fleetwood Mac's Tusk, Elvis Costello's Armed Forces, Pink Floyd's The Wall.  All these albums capture a slick yet edgy (and probably cocaine-fueled) end-of-the-decade sound that on one hand stood out among the disco records that then dominated, yet on the other hand seemed quickly to disappear as harder-edge rock/pop such as The Clash's London Calling and AC/DC's Back in Black moved into the mainstream.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I received my DVD promptly.  It was a great price for a brand new DVD!

6301661737|5.0|Just amazing.  This is not for someone who looks for actions/fighting.  This is for someone who has an interest in Japanese culture and views storyline & character development as most important elements in the movie.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|\\"Collateral\\" certainly kept me entertained, even though the last 15 minutes was just an onslaught of implausibilities.<br /><br />Like all Michael Mann movies, this is mainly an exercise in style, i.e. snappy, eye-catching camera work and atmospherics.  Tom Cruise actually does some half-decent acting here for a change, and looks far less flaky than usual with a head full of salt-n-pepper (mostly salt) hair.  Of course the real show-stealer is Jamie Foxx, and it was a shame we didn't get to see more of Jada Pinkett Smith, ooh la la what a goddess!<br /><br />\\"Collateral\\" tries to dabble in \\"carpe diem\\" existentialism here and there, but by the ending Hollywood has kicked in and it degenerates into yet another predictable save-the-world-and-the-babe formula action flick.  The rest of the time it's very competent at what it does.
0671688782|1.0|One size does not fit all. While the benefits of hugging have been proven and documented, there is the very real flip side of misapplied hugs and unwanted hugs.<br /><br />Dr. Welch has banged on the drum for years about what she calls \\"holding time,\\" but there are the very real needs of those for whom this treatment is undesirable. For example, many people with autism dislike hugs/holding because of a) the sensory onslaught, e.g. body and/or perfume odors; b) hugs can be too tight and therefore unpleasant and c) in many cases involving severely autistic individuals, hugs are often viewed as punitive restraint.<br /><br />Another thing that bothers me about this is Dr. Welch has long advocated this \\"holding time,\\" but scant attention has been paid to the downside this can have. In Catherine Maurice's book, \\"Let Me Hear Your Voice,\\" she chronicles the problems with this method. In many instances, children as young as pre-school age were brought in for \\"holding,\\" all the while being shouted at and told how they [the children] placed unreasonable demands; wanted their way (who doesn't) and, in effect were hurting the family. That kind of thing made me want to run for cover! The premise of this being to choreograph anger (the parents were actually TOLD to be angry at their children and scream these kinds of things at them), all the while inflicting these restrictive hugs.<br /><br />Welch's method smacks of quackery to me. I was also repelled by people following the order to lick their children like dogs do their pups. Welch, along with the Tinbergens and Bettelheim claim that restraint and unnatural hugs will \\"cure\\" autism. That most emphatically is not true! Being autistic has nothing to do with unresolved issues in a parent/caretaker-child relationship. Autism is a neurobiological condition. All the enforced hugs in the world won't cure autism. The enforced hugs were bad enough, but in some cases, Dr. Welch had people \\"straitjacketing\\" their children by rolling them up firmly in blankets, further restraining them. That sounded atrocious and appalling to me. To add insult to injury, she all but blames parents for causing their children to have autism! Her \\"followers\\" sound like they've been sold a bill of goods. Since there is no scientific evidence to support Welch's claims, the whole concept seems very dubious to me.<br /><br />I knew a boy who survived this treatment and hated it. He would say, \\"no more hug,\\" \\"hate hug\\" and \\"Not there! [to the place where this treatment was dispensed] No more yell and no more hug.\\" To him, hugs were \\"when you get yelled at when you're not bad,\\" and to this day he avoids hugs. Imagine explaining to well intentioned relatives why a child tries avoid being hugged. At 10, the boy said he'd rather have been spanked than subjected to this treatment. Now, nearing adulthood, he says, \\"I'm still autistic. I still like to study weather patterns. I'm still an expert on jeeps and military planes and I still hate hugs.\\"<br /><br />As a survivor of enforced hugging, I can say that it was not for me and backfired - instead of resolving anything, it turned me off to hugs all the more. To this day, the very thought of enduring this dreadful treatment repels me. I found it punitive and abhorred it. Who wants to be yelled at and told to look at somebody while being subdued by force?! Who wants to be the recipient of false accusations with no recourse or defense?! Who would want to be forced to sit with someone and endure hugs to appease others?! It is the neurotypical (NT) population who got their way and at the expense of the clients!<br /><br />Enforced hugging does NOT engender love - it often impresses me as being a staged tableau designed to meet everybody else's needs at the expense of the client being forced to endure it. Yelling at people and hurling accusations does not sound like loving resolution to me. Donna Williams' brilliant work, \\"Autism: An Inside-Out Approach\\" addresses this very real issue and said that enforced hugs only teach the lesson of \\"give the desired response.\\" The videos of these \\"holding\\" sessions seem to depict just that - enduring hugs under the most adverse of conditions, replete with accusations and yelling. People with autism (this treatment was directed primarily at the autistic population) usually have acute hearing, so yelling can be especially painful. Subjecting pre-schoolers, some of whom are nonverbal to this kind of treatment is something I find atrocious and appalling. I would never wish this form of treatment on anyone.<br /><br />If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a quack...er, duck. I think this work and the Tinbergens' equally atrocious works are ducks of a feather quacking together.  They quote one another in their respective works, which comes as no surprise.  I think this MIStreatment reeks of quackery and the picture on the cover is just a stock photo - there is no proof that it is of a child with autism who has survived this treatment with flying colors.<br /><br />In fact, I think this method and this book are for the birds. The very expression \\"for the birds\\" came about from birds pecking at seeds horses passed into their manure.  \\"For the birds\\" means of minimal value and from a very questionable source indeed.esson of \\"give the desired response.\\" The videos of these \\"holding\\" sessions seem to depict just that - enduring hugs under the most adverse of conditions, replete with accusations and yelling.

B0009Y336A|5.0|When I first heard \\"Tales Of Endurance\\" on the radio I didn't payed much attention first but when the vocal started I said to myself: I know this voice! That's great!! After a while I knew it was the new Supergrass album which I was waiting for some years. Their last effort (\\"Life on Other planets\\") wasn't as great as their older albums but somehow I knew that their new effort will be much better. <br /> <br />First of all, the songs are more mature and the band is taking it real slow in order to achieve a feeling of grandeur. <br />The best song is definitely \\"Roxy\\" where band and orchestra deliver one of the best climax ever recorded by a rock band. <br />\\"Sad Girl\\" & \\"Keeck In The Teeth\\" is classic Supergrass while spin-off \\"Coffee In The Pot\\" provide an \\"intermission\\" between songs. For the first time (since 2nd album \\"In It For The Money\\") the band is using more of its multiple talents (singing & orchestrating) to receive one of their best albums. <br />\\"Road To Rouen\\" is an awakening for Supergrass fans and a call back to real music.
B0000048CP|5.0|When one think's of black metal they have one of two thoughts, their hatred for it or their favorite bm band's/album's. For me, Bathory is one of those band's and Blood, Fire Death is one of those album's. This is classic black metal for a few reasons, the music is incredible and it has influenced many bm band's I love today. Quorthon was/is one of the most respected men in the Viking/BM scene. Well, with music of this caliber, why wouldn't he be?<br /><br />1. Odens Ride Over Nordland: An intro which does what an intro is supposed to do, get you excited for the rest of the album. Filled with a ton of atmosphere. 4/5<br /><br />2. A Fine Day To Die: CLASSIC black metal song. The intro carries over into this song and then some acoustic guitar which stunned me when I heard it, they were that good. At 1 minute and 44 seconds, the rest of the song kicks in full speed, showing why Quorthon takes no prisoner. 10/5<br /><br />3. The Golden Walls of Heaven: Following up a track such as \\"A Fine Day To Die\\" is by no means an easy task. However, this song does well. Between the great drums and guitar solo that rips, this song is quite good. 4.5/5<br /><br />4. Pace 'til Death: A fast paced, in your face metal song. One of the shorter tracks. For some reason, i always thought Slayer would have done a great cover of this. 4/5<br /><br />5. Holocaust: A good song but if I had to pick, I probably listen to this one the least out of the whole album, even though most of the time I find myself listening to this one all the way through. The guitar work is impressive. 4/5<br /><br />6. For All Those Who Died: What can I say? This could be my favorite old school BM song EVER. This song has classic written all over it, the lyrics are full of passion and they come off as such in Quorthon vocal's. The music is also the best here. Every aspect is perfect. When he screams the lyrics for all those who died, about a minute into it then the drums roll back in, chills go down my spine. Mandatory BM listening. 50/5<br /><br />7. Dies Irae: Reminds me of a longer version of Pace 'til Death. The guitar work in the last minute or so is one of the best part's in this song. 4/5<br /><br />8. Blood Fire Death: obviously, he wanted the last full length song, to be one that would not be forgotten anytime soon. This is up there with \\"For All Those Who Died\\" and \\"A Fine Day To Die\\" as the best song's here. The guitar work is some of the best on here and when those drums REALLY start to get going about 1 minute and 15 seconds into it. You know you're in for a ride, haunting vocals. 10/5<br /><br />9. Outro: Simply an outro, nothing more.<br /><br />So, as you may probably be able to asume, I am a big fan of this band and this album. For anybody who thought Dimmu Borgir (NOT trying to insult them) ruled the fiery pits of Black Metal you need to get this.<br /><br />  For all those who cried aloud<br /><br />But whose tears were never heard<br /><br />For questioning one almighty father<br /><br />Of a heavenly distanced world<br /><br />Beloved thee who submit<br /><br />The holy writings assured<br /><br />The golden cross stained with innocent blood<br /><br />But stand yet a thousand heavenward<br /><br />Burning naked but smiling<br /><br />Not full of fear but pride<br /><br />Knowing death alone could cleanse them<br /><br />Of the reasons for which they all die<br /><br />For all those who died<br /><br />For all those whose great beauty<br /><br />Stirred their tortures to rage<br /><br />And for all those whose great ugliness<br /><br />Did the same<br /><br />For all those who cried aloud in vain<br /><br />For mercy on the rack<br /><br />But whom of dying naked in scorn<br /><br />Not ashamed<br /><br />Burning naked but smiling<br /><br />Not full of fear but pride<br /><br />Knowing death alone could cleanse them<br /><br />Of the reasons for which they all died<br /><br />For all those who died<br /><br />Pleas for mercy signs of guilt<br /><br />Naked bodies broken on the wheel<br /><br />Tears sign the confession<br /><br />With crusted blood lips sealed<br /><br />Trial by water<br /><br />\\"For all Those Who Died\\"<br /><br />  - Bathory<br /><br />  R.I.P.

B000059Z8J|5.0|Many superhero/comic-book films have come to fruition since 1978, but \\"Superman: The Movie\\" still reigns as the best film of the genre. The characters from the legendary comic book come to life thanks to superb performances by a stellar cast. Christopher Reeve is still the \\"definitive\\" Superman, emphasizing his strengths while showing a bit of emotion (And not overdoing the drama, unlike Tobey Maguire in the \\"Spider-Whimp\\"...I'm sorry, \\"Spider-Man\\" movies), and his Clarke Kent is very humorous. Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford give great supporting roles that compliment Reeve brilliantly.<br /><br />Clever writing and superb directing by Richard Donner (\\"The Omen\\") enhance the film, and the great visual effects make you believe a man can fly. \\"Superman: The Movie\\" is a grand motion picture that has withstood the test of time. No matter how many superhero/comic-book films come along, this will remain the standard to which all films will strive to be, and fail. A must for \\"Superman\\" and comic-book fans!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+
0920668372|4.0|I realize that not everyone will like this book regardless of age, but that can be said about anything.  I thought the story was lovely - a mother telling her son all throughout his life that she will always love him forever.  The story ends with her taking a ladder and climbing into her grown son's window to continue the loving routine.  When advanced age and infirmity prevent her from doing this, then the son takes over the role.
B000002572|5.0|Bought this as present for my husband and he keeps telling me how great this cd is.  Every cut is a great song, he thinks its the best album he has gotten lately! Even our teenage son likes it!
B000AL730O|5.0|I can imagine people giving this CD poor reviews because they never really listened to it.  They heard all the hypes, bought it, shoved it in their computers or their CD players and while its playing, went about other business, thinking that the music in itself will entertain and inspire them.  I have to admit I did that and I thought I was quite disappointed at first; even though there were tracks on the CD that sounded good in the beginning (English Tea, A Certain Softness, Fine Line. Friends To Go, Follow Me etc), but I'd just immediately dismissed them as light and fluffy stuff.  <br /> <br />When I did get the chance to really get INTO it - when I had a few moments of my own and listened to it, I was pleasantly surprised.  Every track was strong and different.  Strong because I knew that the ones that didn't stand out on the first listen would surely grow on me - How Kind of You, At the Mercy, Riding to Vanity Fair, etc, the lyrics were sometime dark, but there was never despair in them.  Different because these songs, lyrically and sometimes musically, were different from what Sir Paul wrote as a solo artist - introspective and personal.  Jenny Wren, Too Much Rain, Anyway, This Never Happened Before, Promise to You Girl are all excellent tracks that will stay with me for a long, long time, if not forever.  As for the \\"light and fluffy\\" tracks, I've since listened to them many more times, and I'm finding myself going back for more.  That, I thank is a good sign for good music. <br /> <br />For those who have already bought and dismissed the album, I hope you'll listen to it again - you may just change your mind.  If you are a Beatles or McCartney fan, you'll have to have this album.  If you are not, get it anyway and listen to it, I'm sure you'll find it to be one of the best things you can do for yourself.
B000AL730O|5.0|Another excellent album for the McCartney musical library! Simply said, this has the touch of Paul's first album (\\"McCartney\\")and a lot of his voice from the \\"White Album\\" (upfront with a few different styles). It is another album to add to his library. Do not wait to hear the energy and rawness of \\"Jet\\", the lavish production of \\"Ram\\" or the simplicity of \\"McCartney: Unplugged\\". It is different. The arrangements beg you to re-listen. The songs take a path you do not expect, with different sounding instruments (flugelhorn, musical ray bender, etc.). Not a lot of electric guitar. All of this, makes you feel as if he is in the room playing for you. At the end of the day, this will be looked upon as one of his artistically best ...
B000683VI4|5.0|I loved this movie so much, I immediately rushed out to purchase it when it was released on DVD.  It is the most pleasing, joyful, sad, enticing and thorough love story, I've seen on the big screen in quite sometime.<br /><br />The Notebooks' soul is the firm and undying connection between two people...over a span of decades; from ducklings to swans!  This story's heart is in its youthful exuberance and prolonged longing; from summer love to winter storms!  The movie's spirit resides and abides in its ability to make one long and yearn for something past because remnants of its reality remains buried in your heart, soul and spirit.  This movie is a tear jerker in the real sense of the word. It's rich, it's real and it feels right.<br /><br />In essence it is the story of a fish and a bird, that find common ground and a place to live, even though there are stumbling blocks and obstacles along the way.  Fiance's, parents, illness, War and Pride...<br /><br />It is a story of true and lasting love.  A love so strong, it carries and sustains you for \\"five\\" minute increments, just so your love can glimpse you with clarity, as you both once were.  It is a love story so strong and so pure, it personifies and encompasses...SOUL MATE!<br /><br />A love so real, one would rather go together than stay behind...<br /><br />This is a special, special film..and I recommend it highly and wholeheartedly.
B000001GXI|4.0|I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewers who praise the male singers on the Bohm Zauberflote and the women on the Klemperer. For nearly forty years it has been Solomon's choice with this opera, and I alternate between these two classic versions from the Sixties, which between them encompassed most of the eminent Mozart singers of the time. I don't usually favor Bohm as a conductor, but he is fine here, as long as you are happy with a heavier, slower treatment than one hears today. Bohm is reminiscent of Beecham's famous set with the Berlin Phil., which sounds hopelessly stodgy now so far as tempos  and humor are concerned.<br /><br />As for the individual singers, the performances by Fishcer-Dieskau and Wunderlich top any other Tamino and Papageno on disc. Wunderlich is ardent and vocally sensational; Fischer-Dieskau is actually witty, a rarity among Papagenos. On the women's side, Evelyn Lear and Roberta Peters were estimable singers, but both strain uncomfortably as Pamina and the Queen of the Night. I think Peters was too old vocally, and Lear didn't have the right voice to begin with, although that doesn't excuse her fallible pitch. Anyone who loves one half of this performance will have to endure the other half.
0446310786|5.0|I first read this book when I was 12 years old and it impacted me greatly. Since then I have read it countless times, even before I began to teach it to my HS classes. It has humor, plot, detail, wonderful characterization, pertinent and universal themes, as well as providing an enduring and realistic picture of the South in the 1930's. It doesn't matter that it is somewhat sentimental-- the hard edges of some of the detail toughen it up enough to be the perfect read for either study or pleasure.
B000005RT8|2.0|The less said the better. Two or three barely passable tunes and the rest should be buried and forgotten. Interesting only for collectors to complete their McCartney collections, but the dismayed look on Paulie's face on the cover will mirror yours  when you listen to this stuff. The look says it all:  \\"What was I thinking recording this stuff ? I'm the guy who wrote Sgt Pepper for cryin' out loud...\\"
B00000JR29|5.0|Years ago, I wanted the song \\"Funny how time flies.\\"  So, I went to buy it and found that it was only available for purchase on the gold \\"MasterDisc\\" series.  So, I purchased it from a certain record store and personally, never regretted it.  Now, you all get the same thing (plus extra tracks) at domestic!  Get your copy, and enjoy it!
B000003ER4|3.0|We're still waiting for a great Tote Stadt on records. This one features the bad habits of both Leinsdorf and Kollo, and listening to it for more than twenty minutes makes me rush to take if off. But at least you can hear this wonderful, if flawed opera in its totality in decent sound. If only it were better.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|30 Seconds To Mars burst onto the scene back in 2002 with their self-titled album. Despite being fronted by Jared Leto (the actor who has appeared in two of my favorite films: \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"Requiem For A Dream\\"), the effort didn't receive that much attention, and listening to it, it's easy to see why. Don't get me wrong, their debut was great, but for a band establishing themselves, it was too broad, too spacey, and too high concept for people to really give it a fair chance. So it's no surprise that for their second album, \\"A Beautiful Lie,\\" 30 Seconds To Mars have trimmed the fat off and streamlined their music quite a bit.<br /><br />\\"A Beautiful Lie\\" is more of a collection of songs that a concept album. There is no discernable theme running through it, which means each song brings something different to the table, and has it's own identity. And not only that, each song is just as good as the one before it! Instead of sounding like an electronic-Tool like they did on their debut, 30 Seconds To Mars sound like a perfect amalgumation of A Perfect Circle, The Cure and Incubus. \\"The Kill\\" and the first single, \\"Attack\\" are the most recognizable and straight-forward of the set, centered around giant choruses and excellent songwriting. \\"The Fantasy\\" is my personal favorite, with it's funky intro and unpredictable changes in style. \\"Battle Of One\\" and \\"Hunter,\\" which are tagged as \\"bonus tracks\\" (though they are hardly exclusive, and available on all copies of this album) are great in their own right, but feel tacked on. Perhaps that's why they are called \\"bonus tracks?\\"<br /><br />Overall, \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" is a step-up for 30 Seconds To Mars. The debut was a good start, but this album just strengthens the groups catalog and shows that they have a lot more diversity than many of their contemporaries. And the best part is, their music has nothing to do with Jared Leto's acting career. You don't even have to know who the guy is in order to know that this is great music. If you enjoyed the first album, I highly recommend their second. When they first came out, I honestly doubted they would release anymore music, but I was wrong. So, here's looking forward to the third effort.t music. If you enjoyed the first album, I highly recommend their second.

B0000041Z6|3.0|Solti made himself a national hero in England and a media star in Chicago, ensuring two decades of rave reviews despite the occasional acknowledgement that he persistently drove the music. He made spectacular recordings of Mahler judged by execution and sonics, but in truth he lacked the depth that Mahler's music demands.<br /><br />In its day, these CSO readings sold very well for Decca, given the spectacular virtuosity of the orchestra, but Solti can't help himself--he is a driven, unsubtle conductor who approaches every symphony in a coarse, sometimes frenzied manner. Mahler conducting has come a long way since then...and had come a long way before then, to think aobut it.  I am not a fan of any of these performances, particularly the blatant Second and Eighth -- both famous, high-profile recordings at the time -- but if pressed, I'd rate Solti as best in the First, Third, Fourth, fifth, and Seventh.

B00005JODA|4.0|Ralph Fiennes is a mild mannered British Embassy offical in Nairobi, Kenya. When his activist wife (Tessa) is found murdered, he detects and investigates a coverup by his government and a large pharmaceutical company which is flogging drugs to Africans. \\"The Constant Gardener\\" has a powerful message of capitalist brutality, governmental complicity, and the grinding poverty, violence, and corruption of Africa. I applaud the author for not taking the cheap shot and making an American pharmaceutical company the villain. For the first time -- probably ever -- the villain of a major motion movie is Canadian!  And Swiss too.  A Swiss-Canadian pharmaceutical company. Refreshingly original bad guys.       The reason I don't give the film the top rating is the heroine.  I found Tessa unsympathetic and her do-gooder morals questionable. This is a woman who lies, cheats, and steals to accomplish her aims. Well -- say you -- it was for a higher good: to save African lives. BS say I.  Is her character any better than the liers, cheaters, and thieves she strives with single-minded devotion to expose? . If her opponents are scary, so is Tessa -- but I don't think that is what the film maker intended. Those who live in glass houses...         Perhaps the film would have been more compelling had it focused on Africans rather than a foreign idealist.  See \\"Hotel Rwanda.\\"          \\"The Constant Gardener\\" is superbly filmed and well-acted and the images of Africa and Africans are powerful. The portrayals of British diplomats by Danny Huston and Bill Nighy are deserving of Oscars, as perhaps is the photography.     Smallchief
B00000F6LQ|5.0|Being a Monty Python fan I don't care if it looks no better than the original release. I don't care if it ends the same pointless way. I don't care if there wasn't nakedness when there could have been. My only complaint with the Collectors Edition is that the packaging nearly caused my DVD's to be broken on removal. The center hold down thingies have no give, be careful when removing people. <br /> <br />There are lots of cool extras, funny stuff.

They say it themselves when they \\"form like voltron\\" they are truly greater than the sum of their parts. Crazy beats & lyrics rife with chess kung fu & comic book references.

0811821846|5.0|I received this cookbook as a gift from a friend because I am both a huge Star Wars fan and I am also a chef. She thought that this would be a perfect gift for me and she was right. The recipies in this book are simple and easy to understand. Perfect for getting the younglings involved and teaching them the basics of cooking. Also there are great photos of each item with Star Wars action figures incorperated into each photo. There are numerous recipies that will satisfy any Star Wars fan both young and old. This cookbook is a must have for any Star Wars fan but it is especially a great tool in teaching the kids how to help out in the kitchen while having fun in the process.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Not that anyone really needs another opinion of this musical...but I thought I'd put in my two cents. <br /> <br />The reasons I love this musical:  \\"The Wizard & I\\" (track 3), \\"Defying Gravity\\" (track 11), and \\"Wonderful\\" (track 13).  The first is so poignant in its reflection of what every young person wants...love, esteem, beauty.  Elfaba becomes a character with whom we can identify at this point.  \\"Defying Gravity\\" is probably the best song in the musical...it shows the frustration that eventually leads Elfaba to sing \\"I'm wicked through and through.\\"  And Glida's cast-back to \\"the Wizard & I\\" (\\"you can still be with the wizard/what you've worked and waited for...\\") brings tears to my eyes every time.  \\"Wonderful\\" gets a high place on my list because, yes, it's nice to have the story of the Wicked Witch of the West explained, but it's even cooler to finally see things through the eyes of the little corn-fed hick (\\"who said it might be keen/to build a town of green/and a wonderful road in yellow brick\\").   <br /> <br />\\"Popular\\" is a memorable song too, and \\"As Long as You're Mine\\" could have been.  I found Elfaba's verse enchanting and lovely, dark and seductive yet sweet, and loved the song...until that bum Fyero began to sing.  Who on earth decided that a lazy brainless bum would make a good match for Elfaba?  I just don't see it.  Nevertheless, \\"I'm Not That Girl\\" - both versions - is heart-rending.  I love the stubborn quality in Idina's voice when she sings \\"Don't wish/don't start.\\"  Too real. <br /> <br />The only reserve I have from rating this musical higher is that it wasn't a tragedy.  If Elfaba had become truly wicked and really had melted, it would have had such a powerful message.  As it is, it is dangerously open to being called cliche.  I think it has, therefore, some wasted pontential.  Nevertheless it is quite enjoyable.  I don't think it will become a classic...it is, after all, a fanfic of \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\"...but it is worthwhile, thought-provoking, and VERY enjoyable.
B00005JMJG|5.0|If you have seen hundreds of films and you think nothing can surprise you anymore, this film is for you: extremely original yet romantic, weird yet  true to life, it  is an absolute must-see. Carrey and Winslet are exceptional.
B000084T18|3.0|this album is OK, not a classic by far. But I recomend never buying a 50 album. And ill bet anyone 5 bucks that 50's record sells are just gunna get worse every album he puts out because he never artisticly grows. He is obsessed with guns and killing. Sometimes I would like to hear a little more than that.

B000002MUW|5.0|This is by far one of Madonna's best albums before Ray Of Light appeared in 1998; it has beautiful songs (not only the singles) and the music here is refreshing and shows us a new Madonna. My favourite songs are: \\"SANCTUARY\\", \\"SURVIVAL\\", BEDTIME STORY\\", \\"FORBIDDEN LOVE\\" and \\"SECRET\\", although I do think all of her songs on this album are really good. <br /> <br />If you're planning to buy this album and you're still hesitating, don't! Buy it soon and start enjoying it!

B00063EMJ6|4.0|The compilation is definitely a great sampler of Neil's considerable output and should please most fans - all of the big hits are here. <br /> <br />I have to say, however, that the tracks here sound exactly the same as my old late-80s Neil Young CDs.  I have a great system and very good ears - if these songs were remastered, you could have fooled me.  Down by the River and (especially) Cowgirl in the Sand sound absolutely terrible, as they always have on CD.  Why does the sound quality of these songs on my first-pressing green-label vinyl copy of \\"Everybody knows this is nowhere\\" blow this CD out of the water?  This album was pressed in 1969, for God's sakes, surely the sound quality of these tracks can be improved? <br /> <br />I've been reading for over 10 years now that Mr. Young has been meticulously remastering and restoring his back catalog in order to release the long-awaited remasters of these albums.  It will be nice to finally be able to hear these remasters someday, because they certainly aren't on this CD...
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Angelic music  - sweet and beautiful.  As you can tell, I love this CD.
B0009P42S2|3.0|I, being a (self-proclaimed) animation oficionado, know somewhat of the reputation of Katsuhiro Otomo.  I, myself have never seen AKIRA (yes, I know I should), but after hearing how good this guy was, I wanted to see Steamboy.        So, I rented it from Blockbuster and popped it into my DVD player.  I watched the beautiful steam effects and animation.  I will give him credit for the fact that his movie was visually beautiful.  However, I could see some definite things that needed fixing.        In the first \\"act\\" of the movie, the pace was good, exciting; interesting things happened; the story moved along and kept you interested.  The characters were interesting and we didn't get bogged down TOO much in exposition.  The chases were superb, and that steam bike-wheel invention of Ray's was, I have to say, awesome.     I'm sad that I can't say the same for the rest of the movie.         In the second \\"act\\", we are introduced to Scarlett and wonder why Otomo ditched Emma for this loser; Ray's dad and grandfather spout endless, stock philosophy; and Ray pretty much sits around and listens.  There was only character fattening here for the father and grandfather, not fleshing out.  And every time you think, \\"Hey, Scarlett might be okay after all,\\" she contradicts herself and makes you hate her even more.          Finally, there's the third act of the movie, where things pick up again--not quite to the level of the first act, but SO much better in comparison to the second act that it looks like a gift from heaven.  Ray and the others  actually do some useful, good things (even Scarlett! *shock and amazement*), and (better yet) there's only minimal philosophy-spouting!  Yayness!  There are a couple of pretty annoying things there (like not getting to see Ray catch Scarlett), but overall it was good. Not great, but good.         Then there's the end credits--and I guess they're okay for some people, but I thought that they really didn't need any of them but seeing his house rebuilt and him coming home.  That would be the fairy tale moment to end it at.  I guess I'm just an old-fashioned romantic, but the rest of them seem unnessecary to me.      So, bottom line:  Rent it, don't buy it.
0895260131|5.0|This is a controversial yet still very necessary read in a time when Jihadist terror is makeing the front page almost every day.  It also answers many questions that no one seems to be comfortable in answering regarding Islam's history.  For example, how did Islam expand to include all of the Middle East, much of the rest of Asia, half of Africa, and even into Southeastern Europe?  Did everyone there just decide one day \\"Hey lets be Muslims?\\"  Did they do peaceful conversions through missionary work?  Of course the answer is No to both of these.   <br /> <br />Islam spread by the sword.  In fact by the eighth century the Muslim armies were invading Southern France before they were turned back.  Although the Crusades section of the book is still interesting I actually thought it could have been done without.  All you need to know about the Crusades is that it came in response to 450 years of Islamic expansion and aggression.  Then after the Crusades the Islamic conquests resumed with the Turks gobbling up much of Eastern Europe and conduction raids in Sicily and along the coast of Italy.   <br /> <br />These Islamic conquests were not limited to Europe and the Christian World either, India was absolutely devastated by the Islamic conquest and subsequent colonial rule.  People who came under the new Islamic rule whether they were Christians, Jews, Hindus, pagans, Buddists were all give dhimmi status, meaning they were second class citizens.  These people were forced to pay a special protection tax(jizya) and endured harrassment and intimidation from their Muslim masters.  Centuries of this treatment caused many dhimmis to convert to Islam as life as a second class citizen became unbearable.   <br /> <br />Finally, the last section of the book is equally important as it deals with the PC establishment and their efforts to keep a lid on discussing these disturbing issues regarding Islam.  There is also the jihadists themselves who are willing to kill to keep anyone fromsaying anything critical about Islam.  People who leave Islam live in fear for their lives.  Anyway it is important that you read this book to help you dispel some of the commonly accepted myths about Islam.
B00008S2VG|2.0|In anticipation of her upcoming release, \\"Confessions On the Dancefloor\\", I was checking out what people had wrote about her previous albums.  I was very shocked to see several reviews offering 5 stars of this album.  Being a huge fan of Madonna, I have every album and this by far is the least enjoyable.  Delving into issues of politics and family, the album falters steadily off the invigorating pace she had going with her 2 previous albums.  While 'American Life' and 'Hollywood' try to recover the Mirwais-influence felt on \\"Music\\", the attempt at rap altogether swallows up the first single and the ladder, although the one of the better songs on the album lacks the commercial readiness for any type of radio airplay.  Unfortunately the best song \\"Die Another Day\\", was only added on after being a hit previous to the album's release; and to get that I suggest buying the maxi-single that include several amazing remixes.
0060958324|4.0|This unusual story of Phaedrus is centered around the idea that the fundamental and primary substance of the universe is quality, and the only thing that exists. Thus, quality creates everything and that which is not quality doesn't exist. Except for the way it has been presented, this is identical to philosophical monism, and so suffers from the problems of all monisms : that of the problem of explaining the existence of evil. If we admit that evil exists then according to this thesis, it must be created by quality, and thus evil too is quality or else it does not exist. As in all other monisms, this one too ends up explaining nothing, only making way for a \\"Quality\\" cult or religion. In the story, however, there are traces of quality. As the title goes, even motorcycle maintenance requires a touch of art and just as for any art, needs caring. The better part of the book is about this : the need to care; what you do and how you do it. Which is also what Zen is about : a total involvement in and attention to whatever is being done. The development of the quality concept does serve as a reminder to hard core science buffs that the measurable quantity that science presumes as the only substance of the universe, is the actual ephemeral ghost that haunts science and gnaws at the very foundations of western civilization. But his analysis of the problems in his culture are not only way off mark, but also misleading, as is his conclusion about the turning point in western culture. The difficulty is compounded by his attitude of certainity about his beliefs, which he presumes must be and have to be accepted by all. This borders on his being almost fanatical about his beliefs, which makes his philosophy a closed one and not an open inquiry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
B000002IKR|5.0|Testament's debate album is nothing short of awesome, raw as hell, fast, thrashy, and full of rage, I don't care if Testament are kind of known, obscure bands usually suck, anyways, this debate of the bay area thrashers rules, the production kind of sucks, but doesn't sound too bad, could use a remastering though, still, the music kicks A$$, Chuck Billy's vocals aren't his best on this album, but they certainly aren't bad, some of the lyrics were written by Steve Souza (Exodus), for those who don't know, before Testament was Testament, they were known as The Legacy in about 1983, and Steve Souza was the original vocalist, but he got called to Exodus, another killer bay area Thrash band, and no Testament are not a christian band at all, for those that think that, are morons, if you like old Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, old Anthrax, pick this up. <br /> <br />Over The Wall 5/5 killer riffs, killer solo, nice and thrashy <br /> <br />The Haunting 5/5 another great song, with a great riff <br /> <br />Burnt Offerings 6/5 this song RULES, should please any fan of old Thrash <br /> <br />Raging Waters 5/5 yet another good song, not much to say about this one, it just rules <br /> <br />C.O.T.L.O.D 5/5 2:31 full of rage!! <br /> <br />First Strike is Deadly 5/5, great riffs on this one <br /> <br />Do or Die 4/5 a weaker song, but by no means does it suck <br /> <br />Alone in the Dark 4/5 another weaker song, but it's still good <br /> <br />Apocalyptic City 7/5, THE BEST song on the album, love it! <br /> <br />If you buy this album, and love it, you should like their other releases \\"The New Order\\" \\"Practice What You Preach\\" \\"Souls of Black\\", also check out \\"First Strike Still Deadly\\" it's a bunch of songs from The Legacy and The New Order, RE-RECORDED in 2001, not just re-mixed, re-recorded by the band, so they have better production, and you even get to hear Steve Souza do some vocals with them, he did the vocals on the re-done \\"Alone in the Dark\\" and the last track onthe album \\"Reign of Terror\\" which was recorded when they were known as The Legacy, THRASH!!! <br />
B0000X61UU|5.0|I really love this workout video!!!It is great because it works the total body in an hour. I have been exercising for years and still was pretty sore after my first try at this workout. It is easily adaptable to all fitness levels as you can change the amount of weight you are using for the upper body. It does move quickly though, so I would recommend that if you need several different sets of weights that you keep them close by on a chair or table so you can switch them as needed. I love the three sections of ab- work being spaced out so that your muscles can recover between sets. The video is safe due to an exercise glossary that you can consult to see proper form. I also like how with the dvd you can go and do just the leg work or just the abs. This would be handy if you had only a little time to workout. Overall, I love this workout!
B00005JNTX|5.0|From the opening scene, this film grabs you by the throat, and takes you on an unforgettable ride. <br />Visually stunning, with no holds barred depictions of the violence that dwells within the souls of the inhabitants of \\"Sin City\\". The lines between good and evil are very blurred. <br />In my opinion, as good as \\"Pulp Fiction\\". <br />Undoubtably the best film I have seen in a long time.
B0000C5RQF|2.0|I was greatly disappointed in this production of my favorite opera.  I found it rather overworked in parts and simply ridiculous in others: e.g., period costumes mixed with bride-of-Frankenstein costumes; Papageno in a duck hat; a pathetically misfired updating of Papagena.   <br /> <br />I can't fault the voices, orchestra or chorus and especially think Papageno did a fine jo, in spite of the costume that gave him trouble.  However, I regret investing in this DVD.  I have since seen the Royal Drottingholm Theatre version and find it superior in many ways, even though the sound quality is uneven.  I found the Drottingholm enchanting, but the Covent Garden production was so visually cluttered and ill-conceived that it completely detracted from the glorious music and the great voices.  Mozart deserves better.  And so do opera-lovers.
B00000IFP6|5.0|Ineffably singular.  You think you've heard these symphonies before, but the combination of a smaller orchestra and period instrumentation with ur-text orchestrations makes these recordings a revelation.  Not the least of the set's pleasures is Zinman's respecting of the real tempi called for in the scores - at times a tad faster than they're usually played - which strips the music of the ponderous heaviness that too often creeps in.  One reviewer loved the whole set except for the Fifth, and I can understand why - the Fifth here sounds unlike you've ever heard it before.  I'd say, having listened, that's a good thing.  The best bargain in classical recordings this year.
0790731509|4.0|Paul Newman plays Luke, a charismatic man stuck in a chain gang for breaking parking meters. The authority automatically has a problem with him for this petty crime and he spends the entire movie doing what he has done his whole life: being Cool Hand Luke. Cool Hand Luke does his manual labor with zeal and Cool Hand Luke takes insane bets. Cool Hand Luke doesn't give up. This is his one major flaw, because the authorities want to break Luke's spirit which cannot be broken. Herein lies the point of the film.<br /><br />Sure, Luke is a rebel, but his failure to conform is not thrown at the audience as if it were a message. The events just happen; Luke just happens. This makes for a much more realistic movie and a much more likable character.<br /><br />Luke could be compared to James Dean's character in Rebel Without a Cause, but that comparison would be flawed. Dean's character is much younger in age and in spirit. Luke has been hardened by age and experience; he was probably very similar to Dean's character in youth but has quieted down a bit. In consequence, Luke is less whiney and more to-the-point.<br /><br />Cool Hand Luke is a popular film because the character is one that people can relate to and respect immensely. If anyone has known someone similar, one can relate to this statement. Luke is the type of person that everyone wants to be but often fails to become. Judging by the end of this film, maybe that isn't such a bad thing.
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul is back. The real Paul; the one who wrote \\"For No One\\" and \\"Here There and Everywhere\\". It took my about five listens to really get all of the tracks. A few, like \\"Fine Line\\" and Jenny Wren\\" I loved right of the bat, but my first listen or two left me undecided overall. I guess because many of the melodies are somewhat complex. But this music truely grows on you, and I'm convinced now that this is some of Paul's best music. His voice sounds wonderful. The production is absolutely perfect.The arrangements are perfect and pure Paul. I always hoped that he had another great album in him. This is definately one.
015603008X|5.0|Of some of the few book I have read in my life so far, this was the best one yet. The story is about Charlie, a retarded man, who has so many unique and amazing things happen to him.<br /><br />There are some things that are facinating such as Charlie's surgerey or his girlfriend which I dont want to spoil..<br /><br />..The thing that caught my eye was the depressing life Charlie had and all his problems throughout the book, but he always seemes to try his very best..Lets not forget the mouse who seemed to be his best friend in the world.<br /><br />..It speaks to you and you just imagine it inside your head unlike any other book I have ever read! It's ok to cry if you need to..Ha, never thought a book could do that!<br /><br />Im glad that my high school made me read this book, it was well worth it..and well worth owning in any collection. :-) -ttyl
B00008CQS0|3.0|i received the wrong cd (same problem as Paul in NJ \\"Paul\\") and have become very frustrated. i have been tempted to just keep this one, although i don't think there is a way for me to get the price difference back. ah well...
B0002BO0HG|5.0|If you read the reviews of any of Antony's albums and EPs, here or the UK site, you may find that being rendered speechless after listening to his music is mentioned frequently. I consider this not only accurate but also likely to happen to anyone who may listen to this, his debut, album or its follow-up, the Mercury Prize winner \\"I Am A Bird Now.\\"<br /><br />It has been a long time since a singer or songwriter -Antony is both- has moved me so deeply with the dramatic range of his voice, the enveloping depth of his melodies or the courage of his words.<br /><br />Just consider \\"Cripple And The Starfish\\" and \\"Hitler In My Heart,\\" the second and third cuts, that -particularly if listened together- will absolutely floor you with the tender courage of their lyrics and the glorious beauty of Antony's voice.<br /><br />For those who may not know his work, I may not be able to offer the kind of references that can serve them well. In term of genre, you can't call it Pop or Alternative, for instance, and expect to have a reliable idea of what you'll hear. If I have to put a style label to this music I'd have to coin a new one, \\"Alterative,\\" because that's exactly what it might do to you: alter you.<br /><br />Finally, since I haven't mentioned them yet, a word about The Johnsons. Their sound -almost a chamber ensemble, with the addition of drums and bass- is particularly suited for this music and exquisitely performed. \\"Divine,\\" a beautiful tribute to the star of many John Waters films, \\"Twilight\\" and \\"The Atrocities\\" are another three great examples of the band's gift for accompanying Antony.<br /><br />Although, to my taste, I Am A Bird Now of some songs in the recent EPs (I've reviewed them too, in their pages- may be even more mature statements, this album must be given your full attention. This is a solid five-star album and the first powerful document of an amazing new voice.
B000089RVX|5.0|while u can't compare this to 80's music, u KNOW wat the music is like on the radios these days. ppl like mariah carey went from talented singer to a slutty sell-out. it's pathetic. <br /> <br />i have had this cd for a long time now, 'n it still sounds great to my ears. it definitely deserve a 5 star rating. everything about it is just great. <br />if ur a fan of 80's metal, try to adjust a little. this is different, it has a different direction and feel. b/c it doesn't have great guitar solos, doesn't mean it's boring.  <br /> <br />definitely go check it out, it's an awesome buy. worth the money
B00005JODA|5.0|This is perhaps the best movie of the year, yeah I know people have said with other lesser films but \\"The Constant Gardener\\" is the real deal. It punches you in the gut, presents realistic situations, questions our status in the world today and how much good or bad (War in Iraq, Aids in Africa, gluttony of the US and Brits flip/flop of support for the US) we're doing. This is definitely another movie that like \\"March of the Penguins\\" , \\"Roots\\", \\"Hotel Rwanda\\", \\"Roger and Me\\" that needs to be released to the masses and watched by many people to educate.  <br /> <br />Well who better to direct such a power film that the man himself Fernando Meirelles (from Brazil Amigos!!!!) this is the same great director who brought us the astonishing \\"City of God.\\", this man really needs more attention. I guess being from South America , the media neglects to put guys like this in the spotlight since he ain't American but come-on, he rules!!! <br /> <br />It's billed as a thriller on IMDb but really it's more than that film fans, it's a political thriller/drama/ love story/ social commentary all rolled up into one beautifully written and poignant story. <br /> <br />At it's core it's about what you believe to be right and fighting the good fight for a cause. Really that's in a nutshell. Some of us claim to want to do that, but others do it without procrastinating. <br /> <br />This helps introduce the two protagonists, Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) and Tessa Quayle (Rachel Weisz) . My God, they are so good in this movie, and to think Rachel has beauty to go with her skill as well!!! Fiennes once again silences those snobby critics who still doubt he can deliver a good lead well he does and then some. <br /> <br />Plotwise. the story concerns a journalist Tessa Quayle, involving herself into a corrupt medical company in Kenya with a terrible secret. More than that though Tessa, is a humanitarian who sees the suffering in Africa and wants to help the people. Eventually she learns ofmisdoings by the company there, and when she is about to break the story, she is murdered. Justin (Fiennes) is the conservative in the family, though he and Tessa disagreed on some topics, they love each other. Justin takes news of her death as bad you can imagine. Instead though of using his time to grief and feel sorry for himself, he uses his time to find out the truth, why did his loving wife find and why was she murdered? And more importantly is he next?  <br /> <br />Thus the mystery begins, Fiennes is on here from start to finish, really he's such a good actor, you can't look away a sec from him or Rachel. They dominate here, expanding their characters from simple people with simple goals in mind, to individuals whose emotions go in different directions. <br /> <br />A bigger issue then that Constant Gardener address besides the poor dying people of Africa (a country decimated by Aids) is the issue of greed by the pharmaceutical drug companies and how they use their status as caring and loving to exploit poor people and desperate people for unproven studies with disastrous results. Of course the question that comes up is does this really happen? And the answer is yes, companies like Merck., PFizer have all been embroiled in drug scandals with dangerous drugs exposed by the FDA and news companies like 20/20 and 60 minutes. Of course the drug companies deny all wrongdoing but we as Americans are not fooled and thus we have this constant (no pun intended) conflict of interest with the drug companies over profit and safety. <br /> <br />The Constant Gardener then is simply one of the best if not the best movie to come out in 2005. It was simply a delight to watch this movie, and moreover write a review about it. I really hope everyone goes to watch this movie, and better yet, people should go in groups to see this film because really it's an important film that everyone should watch.  <br />
B00002ZMNV|5.0|it's PERFECT. god i wish i was there. too bad i was only 9 back then. well it's not too bad to own this dvd. i got it last thanksgiving. everything about it is excellent. the guys were great (they looked great too) and of course u cannot forget the symphony. i'm not some1 who usually listens to symphonic music, to tell the truth, i hated b4. BUT, this dvd changed my mind, it gave me a new perspective on classic music. the thing is it's really enjoyable.    the concert includes great song selections such as master of puppetz, the one, roam, nothing else, bells,fuel(love lars's drums), and 2 unreleased songs. i thought battery was kind of inappropriate for the show but hey if it works then why not, it's a great way to end the show.     the dvd includes bonus material such as a 40 minute documentary on the making of S&M, one on one interviews with the guyz and also michael kamen. some parts were hilarious. it also give u the opportunity to choose different angles for a few songs.    this is something u can't miss. it's brilliant
B000002OYB|3.0|3.5 stars.  The sentimental joy of Bat Out of Hell I and II are not quite here in this release.  Diane Warren has a strong piece MeatLoaf with \\"I'd Lie for You\\" and Jim returns for a couple good tracks here as well.  I was hoping for a monumental follow-up to Bat II here (hard to do) but had to settle for a little less.  There are some great tracks with superb performances on this record including the aforementioned however just not much else besdies them.<br /><br />For Meat Loaf records, this is one of his best.  I rank Meat Loaf records.<br /><br />Bat Out of Hell II<br /><br />Bat I<br /><br />Welcome to the Neighborhood<br /><br />Bad Attitude<br /><br />Dead Ringer<br /><br />Blind While I Sleep<br /><br />Midnight at the Lost and Found<br /><br />Have not listened to Couuldve Said It Better
B0006IIKS0|4.0|okay so some parts of it was, boring. i was almost asleep thru some of the stuff and scenes. and b/c of the fact that i'm not a fan of documentaries and actually sat thru THIS, i give it a 4. too high? it's pretty good actually (except some u kno). there u see metallica not just metallica, the greatest metal group in the 80's, or in the world. afterall they're just 5 normal guyz, with incredible talents. they've got their own problems as well.  <br />in this dvd, u see the real thing. alcoholism, family issues, bandmate conflicts, it's tough i gotta say. it makes u understand more about the guyz, below the surface. <br /> <br />i don't really recommand BUYING this dvd, but borrowing it would an excellent idea. u cant miss this
B000AL730O|5.0|The Beatles recorded some my favorite albums of all time. Paul McCartney solo recordings however are a mixed bag. He has recorded some great singles, but few albums hold up as a whole. And as much as I hate to admit it, recently I have been VERY disappointed in his newer recordings. <br /> <br />Well I am VERY HAPPY TO SAY THAT THAT CHAOS AND CREATION IS AMAZING! The new tracks sound like they could have appeared on Beatles for Sale, Help, Revolver, and Rubber Soul; while others remind me of his work in the 70s (Band on the Run, McCartney, etc). Buy this album - it's a classic!
B00064MW6K|1.0|Let me be very clear from the outset: there is not one feature contained within this 104 minute stretch of celluloid that could possibly be misconstrued as entertaining. There are no laughs, there is no originality. There is no acting, no direction, no talent. What little action there is has been done so many times before, and so much better than this. There is, in fact, nothing at all that could possibly induce me to think of this shambolic and wasteful excuse for a movie with anything other than total contempt. <br /> <br />Jim Balent, he knows Catwoman. Julie Newmar and Eartha Kitt, they knew Catwoman. Michelle Pfeiffer, in my opinion, is the definitive Catwoman. Halle Berry is very clearly landing a paycheque. She, in vulgar parlance, stinks. If you're a fan of hers, avoid this movie, it's upsetting to watch a woman who clearly has talent sell herself so very, very short, and if you're not a fan,still do not see this movie. She'll most likely turn you off all Superhero movies until the end of time. Dull, tedious, predictable, and laughable (the Meeow scene and the purring?? What the hell were you thinking, Halle??), Ms. Berry's \\"performance\\" (if such trash could indeed be called a performance) is at best, offensive, and at worst, the personification of everything that's wrong with the current trends of Image-Driven Hollywood. <br /> <br />The supporting cast are embarrassing. The Fat Friend, the stock Boyfriend, and the utterly ridiculous role of Cat-Yoda as played by Frances Conroy (who, it must be said, simply does not belong here) are all hugely homogenous and throwaway, and Sharon Stone as the evil Laurel Hedare is completely pointless. She is not glamorous enough to be believable as the Supermodel-turned-Businesswoman and not strong enough a presence on-screen to be believable as the Villianess. <br /> <br />Direction, as with so many other of the second-rate Superhero movies that studios seem to be churning out these days, relies far too heavily on BAD computer-generated sequences and seizure-inducing flash-shot fight scenes, so the whole visual 'feel' of the movie is one of regurgitated television-standard nonsense. When compared to recent Action classics like \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\\" it pales into nothingness. Get a clue, Hollywood: fans of action want to see real people performing real stunts, and not a slowmo 30 frames-per-second CGI Halle Berry Butt-In-Pleather floating up a wall to avoid gunshots. <br /> <br />I can't tell you in one single review how truly awful this movie is. And I'm a fan of bad movies, on a superficial level. 'Mommie Dearest', 'The Howling', 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' - all of them have comedy value. 'Catwoman'? Well, that's just plain awful.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I don't think many people would have expected Green Day to write the defining album of recent times. For an industry that seems to produce the 'next big thing' every two months, a band that has been around well over ten years might be considered 'old'. That certainly isn't reflected in this album as Green Day have shown that their finger is on the pulse of our rapidly changing environment. <br />American Idiot is as political an album as anything Bob Dylan ever wrote and that is both a good and necessary thing. People who say that musicians, sports people, celebrities etc should stay away from politics are wrong - politics is everyones business because it affects everyone!  <br />I like the fact that most of the tunes on this album are the type that your mum would approve of because the subversive messages will hopefully encourage youth to think about our beleagured system.
630588255X|4.0|This is a quirky classic that we just had to add to our collection. Great soundtrack (Cat Stevens) and lots of funny moments.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|We got this for my son last week for his fourth birthday. He loves it! It's the pefect size for all his Matchbox, Hot Wheels, and other diecast cars. It was also amazingly easy to assemble and seems sturdier than some of the other toy garages I've seen. This one's a winner at our house!
B000AL730Y|4.0|The pleasures of this album, beyond the opening track, reveal themselves very slowly.  The songs are densely written and the catchiest of them, again excepting the opener, are arranged to show off their depths rather than their hooks.  Others have gone in detail into the specifics of the songs so I will simply offer this analogy.  Given time, this album will open up like a bottle of  great French wine given time to breath, which, even when it is ready to drink, is not all berry and oak.  Its flavors have a complexity and depth and richness that can only come from a rich past and years of cultivation.  I suppose in this analogy Paul might be a great old vineyard allowed to go to pot, finally given the careful cultivation its soil and vines and tradition deserve, but I should probably just stop. <br /> <br />On further reflection, I might reconsider this album up to 5 stars but for now, as it plays for its fifth time, I'm sticking with 4.
0618001905|3.0|The importance of this book is in illuminating a less known saga from the colonial past of Belgium and of Europeans in Africa in general. I learned some new things about these unfortunate events. However; this document is less then objective and the author's human rights inclination dominants what otherwise could be an excellent book. As I reached Adam Hochschild's description of Leopold as an ugly, long nosed man with a developed apetite for colonies, I guessed that he missed the target and I was not wrong. Leopold should not be judged against our standards and values, but against those of Victorian era. One could expect the revealing of unknown sources of information, but the author rather limits himself to well known sources, adding only a high dose of disgust and anger towards his subject. The boundaries between historical research and propaganda are narrow. Today, when the lines between news, cheap sensation and propaganda are blurred, it is of special interest to keep them separated as much as possible.

His current evening job has Drive working a heist just north of Phoenix.  As he sits in the vehicle waiting for his teammates, The New Guy who cooked up the job and hired Drive, Dave Strong who aptly provides muscle, and Blanche, who offers the sexy distraction, he notices another car sitting in the nearby alley, mirroring what Drive is doing.<br /><br />Shots are fired; Blanche races into Drive's car with the money; urging him to take off.  Drive leaves with the other vehicle on his back; he gets rid of the tail by cleverly using the police to stop the other car.  However that night at the motel, the thugs from the other car arrive shooting at Drive and Blanche leaving her and the two adversaries dead; Drive has a ton of money, but first must clean up the double cross if he is to use it without someone trying to murder him.<br /><br />DRIVE is a throwback tale to the Noirs of the late 1940s and 1950s starring a tough individual who steps over the legal line, but only so far until the double-cross and attempts on his life turn him into a retaliatory machine.  The story line is action-packed with a strong support cast that provides a look at the support Hollywood role of a driver as well as a first class criminal tale.  Fans will want to hitch a ride with James Sallis as he provides an excellent hardboiled crime thriller.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B0009X766Y|4.0|At the time of its release in 1973, THE STING was considered the inferior of the two Newman/Redford buddy pictures (the other being BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID released in 1969), but that general consensus has reversed today.    THE STING is one of those movies that if you haven't seen yet, you should experience on your own without reading a single review.  There is a reason why this movie won the Oscar for best screenplay and it would spoil the fun to have the plot synopsis in your head before you actually experience the film on your own.    So, what to review here?  The DVD itself and the film has been lovely restored.  The picture is quite sharp and the colors have never looked better as can be seen when compared to the theatrical trailer included in this set.  As another reviewer noted, there is a slight frame jump just after the opening credits end, but that's about it.  Having just the film on disc 1 shows the care with which Universal did the transfer, there are no compression tricks needed to put just a single 2hr 10 min movie on a dual-layer disc.  Moreover the sound quality is excellent with even the gunfire showing the subtle dynamics of recoil and not the typical flat \\"bang\\" (again, compare with the trailer).  The framing is 1.85:1, the same as in the release shown in theaters.    The \\"extras\\" on this set are a bit paltry and this is where it missed a 5-star review.  The second disc contains a trailer (which unfortunately is from the re-release, where is the original?), some production notes, and a 1 hour \\"making of\\" feature.  This feature includes interviews with Newman and Redford, as well as Eileen Brennan, Charles Durning, Dimitra Arliss (who plays the minor character Loretta), and Ray Walston (who died in 2001).  The supporting actors recollections are just as, if not more, insightful than the leads.  The writer, David Ward, and the music adapter, Marvin Hamlisch, also are included.  Hamlisch doesn't offer much more than the usual comments about the ragtime music not being from the period of the film, but it is fascinating to hear that it was George Roy Hill's (the director) idea to go in this direction.  Ward wanted the music to be bluesy!    While the recollections are nice, it's a shame that David Ward did not do an audio commentary to the film.  His screenplay drives everything and so, despite not having George Roy Hill around for a commentary track (he died in 2002), it would have been fascinating to hear Ward's thoughts on every plot point.  Some of these topics are raised in his interview but I would have liked even more.    As a two-disc set, this is a bit pricey, but with a fantastic transfer worth it.  Just don't expect much from the second disc.  Finally, if you enjoyed this picture, you might want to consider checking out HOUSE OF GAMES, which is also about conmen but with a far more brooding tone.
B000002H6C|5.0|Everybody knows who Metallica is, if not you've been living under a rock for a very long long time. Metallica is one of the greatest and most innovative metal bands period.\\".....And Justice For All\\" in my opinion is one of the best if not their best albums released by Metallica. If you consider that the band had to recover from losing a bass player like Cliff Burton, you think to yourself this is one heck of the band.      This is their first album with Jason Newstead, who can never replace Cliff Burton, but plays an important part in song writing in this album and their black album, and does a pretty good job, but is overshadowed by the rest of the band. With Kirk Hammet's  masterful guitar playing, Lars Ulrich's machine gun drumming, and James Hetifeld's awesome vocals. The band is missing Burton's bass element, but Kirk and Ulrich showcase the best performances of their careers this album.     This album is the last heavy metal album by Metallica, before they go mainstream with their \\"Black Album\\"!!! I was amazed when I first listened to this album, it was just pure gold spindled into some great all american trash metal. This album has some elements of \\"Kill em All'\\" and \\"Master of the Puppets\\", blending them nicely together to form \\"...And Justice for All\\". This album also shows how Metallica has matured in song writing wise as well, putting lots of more meaning into the songs.      The production though is choppy, and when the album was mixed it made it seem that Jason Newstead wasn't even barely their with some buzzing hear and their. I guess it would be unfair to compare Newstead to Burton they both have different styles of playing. This album wasn't the greatest album made production wise, with not the greatest equipment ever. Well, nobody cares about that stuff anyways, even with the production flaws this album still kick [...], and will become an instant classic, a must have for any true metal fan.     Song Rating System : (Just in case you were wondering)    5+-/An Divine and or Legendary Masterpiece  5-/Masterpiece  4.5-/An awesome song  4-/A great song  3.5-/All around good song  3-/Good song, but flawed  2.5-/A song with some major flaws that drag it down  2-/A song with a lot of major flaws  1.5-/a bad song  1-/ a very bad song  0-/ an complete disgace  -1 and under/ at this point you get the picture that it's not something you'll want to listen too.     Everything on this album is pretty much rates from 5+ to 5, the lowest rating is probably 4.5, so really this album is a must have.     Overall, every song on this album seems to flawless and fun to listen to. With great songs like     \\"One\\"- Metallica's most powerful song, about a guy that had lost both his hearing and sight in the Vietanm war, song widely aired.(5+)     ......along with some kick [...] guitar and drumming solos in \\"Blackend\\" and \\"...And Justice for all\\"    \\"Blackened\\"- very fast and aggresive with a bit of an anti war theme, an true example of what Trash Metal is supposed to be(5+),      \\"...And Justice From All\\"- Which is the cover song a very, a great listening expperience. This song speaks out against injustice with lines from the song \\"How Dare You rape Lady Liberty\\" and such. Some nice long classic guitar solos truly vintage Metallica!!!(5)     You then have \\"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\\" which starts off like a Wizard of Oz tune, and turns into a fast and agressive guitar lick, that leads into one of the greatest guitar solos of all time(5).     \\"Dyer's Eye\\" which is about Hetifield's childhood, very fast and agressive, with some great guitar action and phemonial drumming to boot.(5)     \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\"- a little bit of an evil tone, with the same theme as \\"Dyer's Eve, I liked the guitar playing in this one, along with the Imperial Walker sound effects in Star Wars representing his childhood always being crused or something like that I guess, but I kind of lost interest do to some of the other songs on this album.(4.5)    \\"Eye of theBeholder\\"- was fun too similar in ways to \\"Blackened\\" while adding some diversity to the album, very fast and agressive,(note: I'm impressed on how Metallica was able to keep the whole album as fast and agressive as it was, that is truly early \\"vintage\\" Metallica would do it. (5)    \\"Shortest Straw\\"- One of the shorter songs on the album, kinda like a mix between \\"Blackened\\" and \\"Dyers Eve\\" in my opinion, with the basic guitar and drumming elements. Not my absolute favorite, but it works. (5)    \\"To Live is to Die\\"- PLainly another great song, nice tempo changes fast and agreesive, what else is their to say gold! (5)     \\"...And Justice For All\\" is one of the best Metallica albums evr released. This is what metal is supposed to be remember that when you look at Mtv promoted nu metal, and you'll see what exactly what I mean when I say that. This is truly a classic, and a gem in my vast collection of music. This is Metallica's last great trash metal album, before they sell out, with the \\"Black Album\\". It is sad when Metallica releases an album like \\"St. Anger\\" when they used to release stuff like this along with \\"Master of the Puppets\\", \\"Kill em' All\\", and \\"Ride the Lightning\\"!     I'm not saying the \\"Black Album\\" is bad either... all record companies care about is money, so they urged Metallica to shorten their lengths of song and make their music more radio friendly, and such so they can get more advertising and such make more money. The \\"Black Album\\" was good and showed the mellower side of Metallica, but after years of the the same crap resulted in \\"St. Anger\\", so record companies stop worring about money and let bands do their thing gosh!     If your a metal fan, this is an absolute must have, no questions aske period. I will give this album a 5/5,... great album!    -Rogue Fox (music critic)
B0009YA386|5.0|Look out Interpol, Editors have come out swinging. \\"Back Room\\" is a solid debut album, quite possibly one of the best albums of the year. In the past few years that has seen an uprising in post punk/nu wave band, Editors have come out and set the perfect example of how to make dark love songs that make you wanna dance.  <br />Right of, you notice the likeness of Tom's voice to that of Ian Curtis. But once you get past that you'll notice that he has his own identity as he crafts beautiful, meaningful songs without any \\"nah nahs\\" or \\"hey heys\\". Accompanied by swirling guitars, thumping bass lines and heart pounding drums, These English blokes create music that will actually capture your attention. In my opinion, the best track is \\"All Sparks\\" which brings me back to 1985. The drums on this track and heavy and almost made me question if a live drummer was used. The lyrics, although a bit negative, are simply amazing.  <br />In all, \\"Back Room\\" is a ray of light that has been long overdue and with I hope they're able to continue with this formula. If your a fan of Interpol, Depeche Mode or even Placebo, This is a must have for your collection. <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|Listening to the singer is worse than listening to a screeching baby.  The guitarist is boring.  The drummer is merely competent.  The bassist sucks.    There are no redeeming qualities to this album.  Please do not allow them to think what they do is good.  Someone greased some major wheels for this to have become a hit.  How much did the record company pay radio stations to play it?  It wasn't enough.

B000AL730O|4.0|I'm sure there are some who would rate an album of Paul McCartney snoring with 5 stars just as there are others who will always base his latest work on his track record and never give him the benefit of the doubt.  I think I fall straight down the middle - I like Paul a lot but I'm easily disappointed by a lot of his work.  It's my own belief that you could take all of the albums he's released since his last true classic, Tug of War, and from the six or seven of them pull together three really great albums.  His problem is as it has always been - he comes up with some terrific stuff and has no one to tell him that the rest of it isn't up to those impossible standards. <br /> <br />I wasn't a tremendous fan of Driving Rain - it was pretty good but failed to capitalize on the gains made by Flaming Pie.  This album is a much more worthy follow-up.  It's great to see that on Chaos and Creation he's minimized his shortcomings.  A lot of credit is being given to Nigel Godrich for bringing that missing element to Paul's work but after a couple of listens it's also apparent that the material is also much stronger than what we've become accustomed to. <br /> <br />I've seen some reviews comparing Paul on this album to Cole Porter and there is the sense that he's really writing songs, not necessarily pop.  There's not much in the way of rock and roll here, which is another thing I personally find frustrating with Paul.  He can come up with some real kick-ass stuff like his originals on Run Devil Run but leaves them off his other releases. <br /> <br />Still, with all of that, I've found myself whistling more than a few of the songs on Chaos which is the mark of a good song.  I can only think of two tracks that I don't care for and the rest of the album stands up.  The question to ask is, if anyone but Paul McCartney put out this album would it be considered first rate and the answer is yes.  Give the guy a break - it can't be easy living up to a musical revolution.

038551123X|4.0|There have been hundreds, if not thousands, of books written about serial killers. They pretty much all follow a predictable formula. Innocent victims fall prey to a highly intelligent sociopath who had childhood issues and the cops/FBI use a variety of means from psychics to cyber systems to catch him.  <br /> <br />Dexter is a bit different. He is a highly self-aware sociopath with murderous moods who works as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami police department. His impulses are controlled through years of instruction and a strict set of rules-he only murders other serial killers.  <br /> <br />In this novel, Dexter's carefully crafted world is in danger when another serial killer starts a murderous spree on Dexter's turf. The second killer mimics some of Dexter's techniques and begins to taunt him by playing macabre jokes that aim suspicion in a direction that Dexter would like to avoid. <br /> <br />Dexter narrates his own story, which allows the reader to really get into his head and see the world as he sees it. This is an amusing point of view, as Dexter is for the most part, aware of his own shortcomings and has learned to be content with what he is. We see the foibles of the humans in Dexter's life through the eyes of someone who finds normal emotions somewhat amusing. <br /> <br />I listened to the audio version of this book. Nick Landrum, the narrator, had a voice that absolutely was designed to be Dexter. While the alliteration got a bit old by the end of the novel, the freshness in approach to a rather stale sub-genre made the book entertaining and engrossing.
B000002INR|5.0|You can compare Skid Row's debut to other hair metal bands of the time because of the pop sheen that the songs have. Good melodies and a production gloss made them easy to play on the radio. But Skid Row was a harder band than some of the others and they proved that with their next CD Slave to the Grind and then got even heavier on Subhuman Race. Regardless of their pop sensibilities, this is a great collection of metal songs. The guitar work is great and Sebastian Bach has one of the best voices in rock music. Their isn't a bad song here and you get both fast paced like \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" and slower numbers like \\"18 and Life\\" and \\"I Remember You\\". Each style is done equally well. Skid Row's debut was one of the highlights of 80's hair metal.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Speaking as someone who's gradually become more and more obsessed with the world of FF7, Advent Children is a godsend.  Japanese fans got their copies on Sept. 14, but those of us in the U.S. have an excruciating wait until November for ours. <br /> <br />That said, being the FF7-obsessed freak that I am, I imported the DVD from Japan (no English subtitle option, no English voice option... unless you're REALLY into FF7, you'll want to wait for the U.S. release.). <br /> <br />Plotwise, I have to admit, it seems rushed, and really, it raises more questions than it answers in some parts.  But visually, this movie is nothing short of stunning.  All of the gang is there in one form or another, even a few that we thought were dead and buried... and for serious fans, the eye candy the DVD provides will make you downright giddy.  And if, like me, you're a fan of Reno and Rude, you'll be grinning like an idiot through most of it. <br /> <br />That said... unless you're either a fan or someone really into current CG work, it's probably better to rent than buy.  Advent Children was clearly made for people who are not only familiar with the story of the original game, but for those who know it inside and out.

B000002KB8|5.0|As other reviewers have said, this C.D. is not groundbreaking. It's much more than that. It's more like earth-shattering. Led Zeppelin may have released a heavy rock album before Black Sabbath, but I truly believe Sabbath's self-entitled debut was the first-ever real metal album.<br /><br />This album was the start of a great career-a career which influenced a countless number of bands; most hard rock groups, including everyone from Smashing Pumpkins to Slipknot, have cited Black Sabbath as an influence.<br /><br />The first ever Black Sabbath song recorded was, well, \\"Black Sabbath.\\" This song (and this album) begins with the sound of a thunderstorm. The instruments eventually begin and the guitars play slow riffs (making it sort of sound like a later Sabbath tune, \\"War Pigs\\"). The lyrics (like \\"Oh no, please God help me\\") help make this song's theme quite dark and brooding. The beat eventually speeds up, however, around the 4:45 mark.<br />\\"The Wizard\\" begins with a solo from an instrument that sounds like a harmonica. The bobbing guitars and drums kick in, and make the rhythm worthy of a toe-tapping, but the harmonica reappears later in the song.<br />Track three, \\"Wasp/Behind the Wall of Sleep/Bassically/N.I.B.,\\" has four parts to it. \\"Bassically\\" has a bass solo by Geezer Butler, and \\"N.I.B.\\" sounds like a song from \\"Paranoid.\\" Its groovy riff, a catchy drum beat, and chants of \\"Oh yeah!\\" make it, possibly, the catchiest moment on the album.<br />\\"Wicked World\\" has more catchy, wailing guitar noise and some fast drumming.<br />And, finally, \\"A Bit of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning\\" begins with soft, almost twangy strumming. Then there is some heavy double bass drumming and some humming bass notes, but guitarist Tony Iommi dominates the show, with wild, wailing, looping guitar solos.<br /><br />Even though I don't think this is Black Sabbath's best, or \\"definitive,\\" album (\\"Paranoid\\" owns that title), this is still a must own for all hard rock and heavy metal collections; it's definitely essential listening for all metalheads. And even if you don't like Black Sabbath (for some odd reason), you've at least got to appreciate what they've done for heavy metal, and what they've done for music in general.<br /><br />What are you still doing reading this review?

B000AL730Y|5.0|This album is very different than any of his others. The lyrics are much more introspective than we usually hear from Paul and with a more somber tone, all around. I've been following Paul McCartney's  music for the last 40 years and there is a definite \\"sadness in his smile\\" ever since he lost Linda.  He will never be the same and so it will reflect in his music as well. Paul was devastated by the loss of his wife of almost 30 years, plus the losses of John and George. The album is great, but as others have written , it needs several replays before you begin to pick up on the subtle \\"old Paul\\" peculiarities that sometimes lay between the lines. He has the same musical talents he's always had, but there's a different man utilizing these talents, a man who has had \\"too much rain\\". I think that listeners from the \\"baby boom\\" era, such as I, will hear and appreciate the album in a much different way. There are quite a few references in the music to the love he has found with his new wife, Heather, but it's never the same as it was and it never will be. Enjoy the album, it's a winner and there's no reason why we can't all enjoy a cup of \\"English Tea\\"  while we enjoy the excellently crafted songs in this album.
B00005JOHU|2.0|Success is both a blessing and a curse; Andrew Niccol is one of the most imaginative screenwriters working today. He has brilliant work like \\"The Truman Show\\" and \\"Gatacca\\" to his credit; even \\"Simone\\" which failed in its execution was at least a novel idea. So, when near-complete failure happens on all levels in a project by such a visionary we are shocked and rather unforgiving. While \\"Lord of War has moments of inventiveness, the bulk of it could have been written or shot by any number of people. <br />   <br />Critics in the press assert that the principal problem with \\"Lord of War\\" is that Yuri Orlav remains the same from beginning to end.  I contend that there are many films in which the bad guy stays bad and we still want to see him succeed because he is cunning and just so darn good at what he does. Orlav is good at what he does, and at his core he's just someone who is more than willing to take advantage of the cynical, corrupt, and apathetic world we live in.  In short, Yuri Orlav is the least of the film's problems. <br />\\"Lord of War\\" tries to be a black comedy and/or a satire. The problem is that Niccol is incapable of satire. He doesn't trust his audiences enough to let the absurd horrors in the film speak for themselves. Instead, we are treated to quips so dull and at times even corny that I expected \\"Lord of War\\" to be the first film set to a laugh track.  <br /> <br />The film hammers its already obvious points home by such astoundingly unsubtle means. For example, the scene in which each of the casings being expelled in slow motion from a machine-gun are made to sound like the \\"cha-ching\\" of a cash register. Sheesh! \\"Lord of War\\" fails as a film because not only is its main character unsympathetic and oftentimes deadpan and uninteresting, but also because it doesn't explore its heady themes in any real depth, opting instead for incredibly inept satire. If you want to a film about a bad guy with a complete character arc you can't go wrong with \\"Blow\\". If you want to see a serious and well-done film about the plight of the third-world \\"The Constant Gardener\\" is more than likely in the very same multiplex, and the choice is an easy one.

B000AL730Y|5.0|Let me sum it up this way -- Paul is back to being a Beatle again. While remaining very 'Paul', he has brought forth a work that can proudly stand with ANY of those great albums he gave us years ago as a Beatle. Obviously, this is no small feat. But like those epic albums of yore, this plays well over and over and over. It's not retro. There's freshness here, enhanced by the maturity and understated complexities that weave their way through the whole CD. The melodies we've come to expect are here as well, sublime and in abundance.  Paul's not going for the clever hook or the cheap-shot pop flavor of the week. This is serious stuff. He's at the top of his form and the release of Chaos and Creation is an event. The best McCartney yet.<br /><br />Even hard-core Lennonites with open minds (an oxy-moron?) should love this CD. Fans of Sir Paul will be saying, \\"HERE! Listen to THIS one!\\".  For those who listen to this once and cast it off -- you lose. This is a masterpiece! Very Paul. Very excellent.<br /><br />I'll leave it to the other reviewers to wax academically about song structure, chord progressions, comparisons, etc.  Right now my jaw is still in the fully dropped position.<br /><br />Thank you Sir Paul and thank you Nigel.<br /><br />===============================================================<br />MADER Method of rating: (scale of 1 to 5 for each element for a total of 25 possible)<br /><br />M: Material (composer) 4.5<br />A: Arrangement (performer/producer) 5<br />D: Delivery (artist/group)5<br />E: Energy/Vibes/Spirit (artist/group/team)5<br />R: Recording Quality (engineer) 5<br />___________________________________<br />Total 24.5 points. 98%  A+
B00007LTIC|3.0|This album opens with a rollicking hillbilly groove that tumbles into more of a rocking Yes vibe.  Going For The One is truly a great song, and not only for the novelty of hearing Steve Howe play pedal steel rockabilly.  It also has some great chord changes.  This is especially apparent if you also listen to the rehearsal version. <br /> <br />The rest of the album disappoints.  The album's ballad, Turn Of The Century, is truly one of the worst tunes that have ever appeared on a Yes album.  In the duration of its seven plus minutes of Jon Anderson delivering orgasmic banshee wails, never introduces a memorable melody.   <br /> <br />Parallels is thick, cheesy, seventies shtick. Its only virtue is that it provides the perfect soundtract for hanging out in the garage, drinking Old Milwaukee, and eating Big Macs. <br /> <br />Wondrous Stories is a little better, and Awaken, the epic instrumental track, somewhat redeems the album.  Thank god the band knew better than trying to make Turn Of the Century into a fifteen minute epic. <br /> <br />This album is widely seen as a return to form for the band.  I disagree.  If you must listen to second tier (after Close to The Edge), I recommend Relayer.  While it is indulgent, excessive and any of the other nasty prepositions that routinely circulate in conversations about Yes, your mother will hate it <br />
B0000026J6|5.0|\\"I'm Your Man\\" has a perfect title.<br /><br />Leonard Cohen IS the man, my man and the man for everyone who loves a sweet, sad ballad sung in a voice that drains every teardrop from the lyrics, and sets them to music that washes over you like rain.<br /><br />This 1988 disc represented a breakthrough of sorts for the Canadian born singer/songwriter. Combined with his now legendary appearance on PBS's \\"Austin City Limits\\" the same year, \\"I'm Your Man\\" won Cohen a legion of new fans in the U.S. where he had previously enjoyed relatively minor success.<br /><br />From the sinister \\"First, We Take Manhattan\\" and \\"Everybody Knows,\\" the latter highlighted by John Bilezikjian on the ode, to the wryly amusing \\"Tower of Song\\" and \\"I Can't Forget,\\" this album provides a crash course in all of the man's styles. The topper, though, is the epic \\"Take This Waltz,\\" based on a poem by Garcia Lorca. Jennifer Warnes shares the vocals here, and adds considerable depth to an already powerful song.<br /><br />Cohen has made better albums (1971's \\"Songs of Love and Hate\\" is his finest album in my book), but \\"I'm Your Man\\" is his most accessible.<br /><br />You the man, Leonard, you the man.<br /><br />Brian W.

B000001IPL|5.0|This album is phenomenal. Gotta get away, Self Esteem and come out and play are world class. Buy the album.
B0000067L2|5.0|\\"Disraeli Gears\\" is the album that gave Cream the title of a supergroup. After \\"Fresh Cream,\\" the band was not seen as anything special, but some saw their potential. When this album was released, however, it flew to the top of the charts. <br /> <br />This CD starts with \\"Strange Brew,\\" which is, in itself, a 'strange' song. Excellent, of course, and Bruce's and Clapton's duet makes this a psychedelic masterpiece. Next is the well-known \\"Sunshine of Your Love,\\" which is arguably the best song by Cream. It is certainly my favorite. The odd poetry and famous guitar opening makes this a classic. <br /> <br />Other notable songs are \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" and \\"SWALBR\\" earned a lot of radio air play. Also, \\"Blue Condition\\" shows Clapton's old roots from his blues days, something that he would get back to later in his career.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This is offspring's best album. I only listen to the offspring! The song americana deserves to be the name of the album. The beatles are too repetative and make no sense.

B00005S6K8|5.0|The original Sabrina, starring Audrey Hepburn, is a film classic and one of my favorite romance comedies, so I was quite hesitant to see the modern remake, which I was convinced would in no way come close to the quality of the original movie.  I was so wrong.  I consider the 1995 version of Sabrina to possess the most perfectly written script in film history.  After seeing the movie countless times over, I still catch subtleties that I had not appreciated during prior viewings.  Although the direction is not as skilled as that of Billy Wilder, it is still excellent, as is also the casting.  Following in the footsteps of other great works, it proved a disappointment at the box office When it was released in 1995. However, the film is destined to be a romance classic and will, in my opinion, ultimately shine above the original.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|I would not reccommend this movie unless you like to degrade or put down other people and feel superior. If you get a kick about mocking other people you classify as \\"losers\\" then you will like this movie.  Again and again reviewers have said that Napoleon getting hit in the head with a piece of steak (thrown by his uncle) while riding his bike which knocks his glasses off is the \\"funniest\\" part of the movie. The emotion it brings up in me is to tell the uncle to stick it and f___ off. So it was not funny for me to see someone get hit in the head. It was not funny to see the bullies abusing people in school, like when Napoleon is knocked against a locker (by a school thug, ironically called a \\"cool kid\\" by another reviewer) or another student is grabbed by the neck and has his head driven towards the floor like 7 or 8 times.  In my life, I had the school thug/bully grab me by the neck and tell me not to speak to him ever again or he would kill me (and I said nothing to him.)  So no I don't think scenes like this are funny.  Anything good about the movie is ruined by scenes of abuse.
B000AL730O|4.0|The great thing about the legendary Sir Paul McCartney is the fact that he stays true to his 60s root in his mix of rock and pop.  On this album, you still hear the influence of The Beatles and that is a positive thing.  McCartney is keeping their vintage sound alive today in 2005.  There are few people who could make an album such as CHAOS AND CREATION IN THE BACKYARD.  The closes thing to this well, densely orchestrated at times, affair is Ben Folds's excellent (and way underrated) SONGS FOR SILVERMAN.  McCartney mixes strings, acoustic guitars, saxophones, horns, and piano to make a very credible album that sounds directly out of the pop music of the 1960s and 1970s.  McCartney sounds as good as ever here and not only is he good vocally, he is just as strong where songwriting is concerned.  Only could McCartney pull off what would be considered corny by todays kids on a novelty song such as \\"English Tea\\".<br /><br />I won't elaborate on the songs individually because for the most part, all of the songs were consistent.  My least favorite song was \\"Certain Softness\\".  While it wasn't a favorite, it was still a very good track.  My very favorite songs were \\"Fine Line\\", \\"English Tea\\", and \\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\".  The rest of the songs, as I've stated before are brilliant. While Paul McCartney may not be as youthful as he was during The Beatles days, he sounds just as strong and just as youthful as those times.  He is a true musician in every sense and CHAOS proves to be no different.  4 Big Stars for Sir Paul.
B0009W5JS2|1.0|The plot is basically this:  Bad guys and gals are ONLY white, a token intimidated white male who is a geek, and good guys are blacks who all are into whores, stealing, and cars. I don't know which is worse - the stereotyping of all whites as evil or the stereotyping of all blacks as brutal street thieves.  &lt;GAG> This movie is worse than I thought it was possible for a movie to be.  The plot is basically a black separatist mentality coupled with really bad dialogue hiding behind rapid images and pounding music. This is definitely NOT Dr King's dream!
0767817478|1.0|The problem with this remake of the horor classic is that its makers missed a few crucial points about the main character. The original came not long after atomic bombs fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the stark black and white images of Tokyo's destruction play like a glimpse into the collective unconscious of Japan's traumatized people. The monster is nature [...] by man, the ruthless and inhuman will to destroy, the retribution of the gods upon man for the sin of the nuclear age; in a word, Godzilla is TERRIFYING!   In the remake, we get instead an overgrown lizard who just wants to have her babies in peace. Which is fine, but shouldn't a remake of a classic convey more of the original than just its title?
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Because we all know that an orchestra can be used in many, many ways. <br />There are poor quality cds, average ones, good and very good ones.There's even those cds that are excellent.But very few achieve the status of LIFETIME EXPERIENCES and this album, Once by finnish band Nightwish is such achievement.Improving in every way their past efforts (even masterful album Oceanborn) this album is the masterwork of the main composer in the band, the keyboardist.There's no denial that a real orchestra is the perfect choice for Nightwish to fully realize their potential.The songs breathe with depth and majestuosity, atmosphere and sheer ectasy of melodic fireworks of speed and intensity.Symphony X are one band that did the best they could with samples and keyboard arranged like classic instruments but the real orchestra is without a doubt the way to go as proved by Nightwish here. <br />The production is crystal clear and you can hear every nuance in the music.All the album is a highlight but i have to go with Dark Chest Of Wonders; Nemo; Dark Gardens; Romanticide and Ghost Love Score as some of the most beautiful and engrossing music that i have ever heard.The bonus tracks are also essential. <br />Need i say more? Highly Recommended!!!!! <br /> <br />
B000A5044C|5.0|The most heart wrenching Japanese movie I have seen to date is Isao Takahata's anime \\"Hotaru no haka\\" (\\"Grave of the Fireflies\\").  Once a year I steel myself to watch it again, even though doing so is as painful as the first time.  \\"Dare mo shiranai\\" (\\"Nobody Knows\\") is almost as painful and the two narratives have much in common.  Director Hirokazu Koreeda's film tells the story of 12-year-old Akira (Yûya Yagira) and his three younger siblings, Kyoko (Ayu Kitaura), Shigeru (Hiei Kimura), and Yuki (Momoko Shimizu) after their mother (You), abandons them in a tiny Tokyo apartment.<br /><br />When we first meet this family the mother and the two oldest children are moving into the apartment, carrying heavy suitcases.  Inside are the two younger children and this comic beginning to the film only sets up the tragedy to come.  The mother smiles too much and we quickly pick up that she is not to be trusted.  Akira has already learned this hard lesson, along with the guiding rule of their lives: do not let anybody know about the two younger children.  When the mother disappears, this rule and Akira's fear that the authorities will break up their unhappy family, keeps him from seeking help when the money runs out, the power is shut off in the apartment, and the children are starting to starve.  But there is always food being thrown out at a local sushi restaurant and ways of getting desperately needed medicine.<br /><br />This story of \\"Dare mo shiranai\\" is based on a true story, but as far as I know that is only to the extent that there really were young kids trying to living on their own after they were abandoned by their mother.  I do not think Koreeda is following the particulars of that case.  But knowing that is important because we have to accept that these children have become invisible to the adult world, which is exactly what the title assures us.  So nobody notice, even though we have reason to believe the rent has not been paid on the apartment and the stench must be getting noticeable to others in the building.  That is why the true horror of this film is that their situation continues unabated and that beyond the pivotal tragedy in the final act the final shot of the film is really the most horrific moment of all.<br /><br />This 2005 film runs 141 minutes but there is a rationale to what might be considered an excessive length because it gives a palatable weight to the long time these kids are left on their own.  Yagira won the award for Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival, and his performance hinges on the look on his face and in his eyes as we fill in the silence with what we think must be going through his mind.  Consequently, a lot of the credit must go to Koreeda, who constructs such meaning for us in our own minds from what we seen on the screen.  There are some points in which Koreeda overplays his hand.  One is the character of young Saki (Hanae Kan), who takes an interest in Akira and whose solution to the plight of the children is different (I feel that I do not know enough about what poverty is like in Tokyo today to understand the point of this plot development).  The other is that when Akira finds an hour or two to live the life of a normal boy his age that fate finds a way to punish his brief moments of happiness.  Koreeda's strength is in his depiction of the quiet moments of desperation for these children as he shows a world where being allowed to wear a pair of squeaky shoes is a great gift and running out of coins while being on hold is a living nightmare.noticeable to others in the building.

B000667FN8|1.0|WTF, I hate Simple Plan. The guitar player is fake and a poser. And the lead singer is definitely g@y, or his voice sounds VERY VERY g@y. I'm sick of g@y bands...avoid this like the plague.    UPDATE: I noticed that under the \\"customers who bought this bought...\\" section, and found Jesse McCartney's \\"Beautiful Soul\\", and found that Simple Plan is THE PUNKEST PUNK RAWK BAND EVER, EVEN MORE PUNK THAN THE RAMONES, AC/DC, SYSTEM OF A DOWN, AND NINE INCH NAILS...lol, my sarcasm, but seriously, how is Simple Plan \\"punk\\" if their music related to Jesse McCartney's?
B00009P1O2|5.0|Put this disk in as the highlight culmination of a great rock night: I started with Tom Petty live at the Filmore, continued with AC/DC live in Munich, and ended up listening to the whole Queen Wembley concert.... ever since track 6 \\"It's a kind of magic\\" this concert takes you from highlight to highlight... and everytime you think, the show is over, Queen tops it!!! If you have no idea, who Queen is, you'll know it after watching this: The greatest crowd you've ever seen, hit after hit after hit... and an absolut unparalleled voice performance and showmanship by Freddie Mercury... the one Live Concert DVD, after which I REALLY thought, I wish, I could have been there - and in a way I was!
B000AA305M|5.0|It's been a long time since I have found a new CD I can say is a gem. Every song is listenable from this very talented artist. He has hit is peak on this one. Only thing that can top listening to this is seeing him live. Buy it if your looking for some excellent new music.
B00001PE4D|4.0|Despite the unnecessary sexual parts between Sebastian and Kathryn, Cruel Intentions is a very good movie. It's a great story on how a player turns good and falls in love. The ending is way to sad for my taste but it was still good. It would have been funny to see his death be a joke to his sister Kathryn. There were a lot of funny parts in the movie, my favorite being the one at the retirement home with Sebastian talking to Mrs. Sugarman. It's really funny and really shows his personality. I loved how they introduced Sebastian. At first you think he's a bad guy turned good at therapy and then it shows you how cocky he is. Reese Witherspoon was really good as the \\"good girl\\" in this movie. The character of Cecille has no point in the movie in my opinion except to make it funny when Sebastian pushes her off the bed. It's a really romantic movie at the end but the sex scene between Sebastian and Annette was a little long in my opinion...we got the point.
B000002GQL|4.0|Originally released in November of 1972, \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" is the last of what is known as the Moody Blues' \\"Core 7\\", i.e. their 1967-1972 era albums.  Although it's fair to say that the band had undergone a certain evolution over the course of this period, it's also fair to say that by this time they had settled into a formula and were no longer breaking new ground, and at times it sounds like the group would have rather been elsewhere.    One interesting thing about the album that does set it apart is the presence of the Chamberlain which is used in place of the Mellotron in certain places, providing the album with some extrodinarily lush sounds.  Granted, keyboardist Mike Pinder was a master of the Mellotron, and the previous 6 albums were all lush in their own right, but the Chamberlain provides a bit of a different and unique feel.    There are some great songs here.  The album opens with Pinder's pleading, arrestingly dramatic epic \\"Lost In A Lost World\\" which has a winding, expansive feel.  It's followed by Justin Hayward's moving ballad \\"New Horizons\\" which is one of his most tender compositions--excellent layered vocals and layered guitar work from Justin on this track.  Pinder's ultra-atmospheric ballad \\"When You're A Free Man\\" has an arresting spiritual quality to it and has a note-perfect double-tracked Hayward guitar solo, a snippet of which sounds almost exactly like what he'd later play in the intro of \\"Steppin' In A Slide Zone\\".  John Lodge's uptempo album-closer \\"I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band)\\" is extremely catchy and energetic, with another great Hayward solo, and the synthesized brass gives the song a strangely primitive and profound quality.    Absolutely none of the remaining tracks are weak, although they occasionally sound tired an uninspired.  Ray Thomas' folky, medieval-sounding \\"For My Lady\\" is nicely melodic, but the dorky accordian on the chorus is ultra-hokey.  Lodge's \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" is quite strong, with moving verses, but the chorus is overly-bombastic, with lead guitar work that's crafty but feels out of place.  \\"You And Me\\" has great layered guitar licks from Hayward, and the verses and chorus are catchy, but it's attempt to be anthemic feels a little forced.  \\"The Land Of Make-Believe\\" is a characteristic Hayward epic along the lines of the previous album's \\"You Can Never Go Home\\", starting off mellow and folky before quickly building--unfortunately, it's way too melodramatic and bloated to really take off, although it's still reasonably pleasant.    In closing, \\"Seventh Sojourn\\", despite the flaws, is solidly recommended--it's a strong ending to this era in Moodies' musical career, and if you're a fan of the band, it's inconceivable that you'll dislike it.
B00008972S|5.0|<br />WEST SIDE STORY (1961, United Artists) is one spectacular movie musical and winner of eleven Academy Awards, including a special one for  Jerome Robbins' brilliant choreography.  This is Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET set to superb music, and you will never be able to read the play again without wanting the show's songs.  Arthur Laurents wrote the book for the stage show, which had music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and choreography by Robbins--all repeat their roles in the brilliant Robert Wise movie (co-directed by Robbins), which has a screenplay by Ernest Lehman (who later worked with Wise on THE SOUND OF MUSIC, as did production designer Boris Leven).  I am watching both films this week in honor of Robert Wise, who died in the last couple of days at age 91. <br /> <br />We start with an enthralling prologue that combines knockout music with Saul Bass' excitingly colorful mosaic painting of lower Manhattan for five minutes.  This then merges into a helicopter  looking down on an empty Manhattan with no music, until we come to two street gangs, the Sharks and the Jets, on a playground.  These will become the two rival forces in the drama.  Tony (Richard Beymer with a dubbed singing voice) loves  Maria (Natalie Wood with a dubbed singing voice), who are on opposite sides in the gang war.  PEYTON PLACE's Russ Tamblyn sizzles as Riff, while George Chakiris won an Oscar as Bernardo, Maria's volatile brother.  Rita  Moreno also won an Oscar as Anita, Maria's knowing sister. <br /> <br />WEST SIDE STORY gains from two directors.  Robert Wise gives it a cinematic excitement, helped by the magnificent color and camera movement of cinematographer Daniel Fapp.  And Jerome Robbins, also the choreographer, maintains the stage excitement for enthralling musical numbers.  The movie is in the stratosphere as Tony sings \\"Maria\\" in colorfully lit alleys and playgrounds, then Anita does \\"America\\" on a crowded rooftop with dancers, then Tony and Maria doa fabulous \\"Tonight\\" duet on a fire escape.  Back-to-back musical gold.  It does not get much better than this in the American musical theater.  But how will it top itself?  We are only 45 minutes or so into a 153 minute movie. <br /> <br />Each subsequent musical number seems to take place in a different setting for visual excitement.  Leven and Fapp deserved their Oscars for, respectively, sets and photography.  \\"Officer Krupke\\" on a sidewalk is hilarious.  Right after the intermission, Maria does a poignant \\"I Feel Pretty\\" in her bedroom with a pretty orange and yellow dress.  Then the gangs get up on a rooftop to do \\"Puerto Rican Rumble\\" with dazzling lighting, intercut with an enthralling \\"Tonight\\".  Every single song in this show is a winner, and the choreography is so sensual and exciting. <br /> <br />Something dramatic and awful happens in a knife fight under a bridge; I won't tell you what here to not spoil the surprise.  But it gets Tony and Maria up on the roof again for a powerful \\"There's a Place For Us\\", one of the show's very best numbers.  A death has occurred, but the gangs are still not satisfied and want more violence.  The big number with them back on the street is \\"Be Cool\\". <br /> <br />The ending is tragic, stunning, and electrifying.  Store owner Ned Glass and cop Simon Oakland both beg the gangs to stop fighting.  But someone else still dies on a gorgeously lit playground with a gun.  It is a revenge killing and packs a wallop.  \\"Somewhere, Somehow\\" ends the show on a potent and sobering note.  WEST SIDE STORY is one of the g reat movie musicals of all time, the big Oscar winner of 1961, including Saul Bass' creative end credits.  And if you are lucky enough to find the special DVD edition I have been reviewing, it has the screenplay (!), a filmmaking documentary, audio tests of Natalie Wood doing her own singing, theatrical trailers, and production design storyboards. <br /> <br />A correction in my THE SOUND OF MUSIC review.  The Five Star Collection edition I was reviewing is on moratorium because a brand-new 40th Anniversary edition is coming out in the middle of November.  It is priced to sell to families for around $20, has two audio commentaries, a filmmaking documentary, a songs-only soundtrack sing-along, and a look at the seven kids then and now.  Sight-unseen, it sounds like a very nice Christmas present.  And if I did not give credit to Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer as lead actors, I do so now.  The movie would be a lot less fine without their superb performances.  One of the new audio commentaries features both of them, which  could take the place of a lengthy 35th anniversary DVD behind-the-scenes documentary. <br /> <br />

B00003CXCS|5.0|Oscar-winning producer/director Robert Wise is dead at 91.  He lived a full and wonderful life, and his cinematic legacy covers all genres.  Check out this partial lineup from just the 1960s-WEST SIDE STORY, TWO FOR THE SEESAW, THE HAUNTING, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, THE SAND PEBBLES, and STAR!  Wise started out as an editor at RKO.  He edited CITIZEN KANE and (re)edited THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS for Orson Welles in the early 1940s, then directed one of the scariest of the Val Lewton psychological chillers:  THE BODY SNATCHER (1945) and a great boxing drama called THE SET-UP (1947). <br /> <br />Wise's most famous film is probably the Oscar-winning Best Picture and Director winner, THE SOUND OF MUSIC (1965, Fox).  It and WEST SIDE STORY were what came to my mind first when I heard he was dead.  I was going to single out a less well-known Wise film for review here until I took an informal poll and found that a startling number of friends and business associates on my e-mail distribution list had never seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC uncut and non-commercial anywhere-theater or home video--, just parts of it butchered and with commercials on NBC or ABC.  So I recommend watching a studio print of THE SOUND OF MUSIC on deluxe double DVD to salute a great and incredibly versatile filmmaker. <br /> <br />MUSIC was first a real-life drama, then a 1950's play by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse with Mary Martin and songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein, then an enormously popular Best Picture Oscar winner in the mid-1960's.  It is about the courageous Von Trapp family trying to live with the Nazi occupation of Austria in 1938 Salzburg, then later attempting to flee the country as professional singers.  Christopher Plummer plays the widowed Captain with seven children; Julie Andrews got an Oscar nomination (one year after winning the award for MARY POPPINS) as nun Maria who is much too independent to ever be whatever comes next for a nun.  During a night storm, she teaches the kids \\"RaindropsOn Roses\\"-until she is interrupted by a drenched Liesl (Charmian Carr), oldest of the children, who has been in the moonlit yard gazebo singing \\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\" with young Nazi messenger Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte). <br /> <br />MUSIC was filmed all over Salzburg.  Bike riding around the town in olive and white window curtain clothes, climaxes with \\"Do Re Mi\\" on top of a beautiful mountain.  Shortly thereafter, the Captain is furious to learn that his kids have been wandering all over the town in bedsheets, albeit having a wonderful time.  But his anger is calmed when his fiancee, Baroness Eleanor Parker, finds the kids charming.  Meanwhile, Maria is slowly falling in love with the Captain, and he with her.  There is a fun puppet show, which is often cut for time on TV.  The kids and the Captain all sing the lovely  \\"Edelweiss\\" to the Baroness and show biz manager Max (Richard Haydn).  But during a lavish party, Maria leaves the mansion with a goodbye note for the Captain.  Intermission.  We are about 100 minutes into a 174 minute movie that has restored roadshow music and intermission on DVD. <br /> <br />I have seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC on stage, and it just dies, despite the wonderful songs and competent actors, because of painted backdrops for the town and Alpine mountain meadows.  By contrast, this Robert Wise movie (scripted by Ernest Lehman) is a masterpiece with dream casting to match the incomparable songs.  After the intermission, Maria returns and the unhappy kids come to life again.  The Baroness realizes that the Captain is in love with Maria and fades into the background; Parker is wonderful in this role.  The Captain and Maria have a romantic duet \\"I Must Have Done Something Good\\" in the moonlit gazebo; so do Liesl and Rolfe, which is tricky because an Austrian girl is romancing a Nazi, who becomes a villain in the last half hour. <br /> <br />The Von Trapp family and Maria have to flee a country plagued by insidious Nazis.  But first the Captain and Maria get married, in a cathedral with grand music.  Maria got permission from the Mother Superior (Peggy Wood), who gets to do \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\" for Maria in her church office.  The big climax to the movie is a performance of \\"So Long, Farewell\\" and \\"Edelweiss\\" for a packed audience in a theater that has Nazis taking up the entire first row and guarding the exits.  But you know this movie has a happy ending, or else it would get booed!  A gripping night graveyard scene leads to an enthralling finale that gives me goosebumps every time I see it.  The movie won five Oscars and was nominated for several more. <br /> <br />Do yourselves a favor.  THE SOUND OF MUSIC, again, runs 174 minutes and is usually cut to 145 minutes for showing on commercial TV.  Trust me, this show needs to run a full three hours.  It does NOT have half an hour of dead material!  You can buy a bonus-free studio print DVD for $10, or the super-duper Five Star Collection for about $30.  (It looks like this one is on temporary moratorium so that Fox can bring out a 40th Anniversary edition soon.)  The more expensive edition belongs in every family.  Among its exhausting bonuses are audio commentary by producer-director Wise (who wisely keeps quiet during the songs), an extensive 87 minute filmmaking documentary, Charmian Carr's home movies as Liesl, a congratulations telegram from Dan Truhitte (Rolfe), a 36 minute 1965 documentary on the beauty of Salzburg, audio comments by writer Ernest Lehman and Julie Andrews, and what seems like someone's uncut dissertation.  It ran several hours (!) for me and is self-generated with arrows you push at your own speed, documenting the history of the Von Trapp family, the creation and production of the 1950's play, pre-production through post-production almost day by day for the movie, and what the family has been up to since the movie.   <br /> <br />This is one stupendous DVD, which also gives you a THX-mastered soundtrack and the original widescreen aspect ratio (so you can see all of the children and all of the outdoor scenery at once).  Man, I love this immortal screen classic!  I find it unimaginable that people exist on planet Earth who have never seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC in a theater or uncut and non-commercial somewhere else somehow.  For Heaven's sake, treat yourselves, on a birthday or anniversary-or Robert Wise's death, to one of Hollywood's greatest musicals with the Five Star Collection of the movie on DVD. Or the upcoming edition. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000584TM|4.0|Originally released in November of 1972, \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" is the last of what is known as the Moody Blues' \\"Core 7\\", i.e. their 1967-1972 era albums. Although it's fair to say that the band had undergone a certain evolution over the course of this period, it's also fair to say that by this time they had settled into a formula and were no longer breaking new ground, and at times it sounds like the group would have rather been elsewhere.    One interesting thing about the album that does set it apart is the presence of the Chamberlain which is used in place of the Mellotron in certain places, providing the album with some extrodinarily lush sounds. Granted, keyboardist Mike Pinder was a master of the Mellotron, and the previous 6 albums were all lush in their own right, but the Chamberlain provides a bit of a different and unique feel.    There are some great songs here. The album opens with Pinder's pleading, arrestingly dramatic epic \\"Lost In A Lost World\\" which has a winding, expansive feel. It's followed by Justin Hayward's moving ballad \\"New Horizons\\" which is one of his most tender compositions--excellent layered vocals and layered guitar work from Justin on this track. Pinder's ultra-atmospheric ballad \\"When You're A Free Man\\" has an arresting spiritual quality to it and has a note-perfect double-tracked Hayward guitar solo, a snippet of which sounds almost exactly like what he'd later play in the intro of \\"Steppin' In A Slide Zone\\". John Lodge's uptempo album-closer \\"I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band)\\" is extremely catchy and energetic, with another great Hayward solo, and the synthesized brass gives the song a strangely primitive and profound quality.    Absolutely none of the remaining tracks are weak, although they occasionally sound tired an uninspired. Ray Thomas' folky, medieval-sounding \\"For My Lady\\" is nicely melodic, but the dorky accordian on the chorus is ultra-hokey. Lodge's \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" is quite strong, with moving verses, but the chorus is overly-bombastic, with lead guitar work that's crafty but feels out of place. \\"You And Me\\" has great layered guitar licks from Hayward, and the verses and chorus are catchy, but it's attempt to be anthemic feels a little forced. \\"The Land Of Make-Believe\\" is a characteristic Hayward epic along the lines of the previous album's \\"You Can Never Go Home\\", starting off mellow and folky before quickly building--unfortunately, it's way too melodramatic and bloated to really take off, although it's still reasonably pleasant.    In closing, \\"Seventh Sojourn\\", despite the flaws, is solidly recommended--it's a strong ending to this era in Moodies' musical career, and if you're a fan of the band, it's inconceivable that you'll dislike it.
0786852550|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read so far.<br /><br />So original and unexpected in events' sequences you get surprised many times. I loved the characters, the plot, and mostly the magic system the writer pictured.<br /><br />Bartimaeus alone is enough to love this book.<br /><br />You listen to me reader; you want a good read? then go and take this book without a second thought.

B000683VI4|3.0|As is the case with the book, \\"The Notebook\\" is an unexceptional story. The overall experience is improved, however, by the presence of Rachel McAdams, one of the brightest stars in Hollywood today. This is McAdams' movie from start to finish, in spite of interesting performances by James Garner (my favorite actor) and Gena Rowlands. The character of Noah is not as appealing as he is in the book, and I think this makes Allie's dilemma less dramatic than it could have been. Parents beware that the sexuality in this movie is \\"R\\" caliber.
B0001LJCPC|3.0|There are two types of soundtracks, those you buy because they contain music \\"inspired by\\" the movie, and those you buy because the actual movie music is good. This is the latter, and that is why it dissapoints so terribly.<br /><br />Yes, the songs on the soundtrack are good, however, what's missing is the main reason anyone would want this disk in the first place. First of all, the score that Robert Rodriguez wrote for 1$ is not featured at all. AT ALL. Now to say that this was a terrible tragedy would be lying. However, Some of his music is very good (see the song when Elle is packing up the money in Bud's trailer). It's classic spaghetti western done up in modern awesomeness, and it's very remeniscent of his score for Once upon a Time in Mexico.<br /><br />Secondly, the best part of this CD is the Ennio Morricone songs, but even in their glory, they still arent his best work. His best work, such as the theme from a Fistfull of Dollars, is featured in the movie, but again, not in the soundtrack. This is just awful.<br /><br />Lastly, probably the best and most epic song in the movie is \\"the Sunny Road to Selina\\" when Beatrix is walking through the desert. It's grand and epic and its heartbreaking as it segways into the second major confrontation of the movie. And again, it's not on the soundtrack. Like any of the previous mentioned complaints, this is the worst. Primarily because the song is impossible to find in the states, and nearly impossible to find in Europe. Come on Tarantino, if you could get the rights to play this in your movie, you could get the rights to put it on the soundtrack. No excuse.<br /><br />Forgiving the fact that dialogue tracks are laughable and unnecessary, I'm knocking 2 stars off this cd because of the above mentioned faults. However, the music that is on the cd is worth listening to, especially \\"The Chase.\\"<br /><br />Only buy this cd if you like the actual songs on it. If you like the score, or similar music get Morricone's soundtracks and get the track for Once Upon a Time in Mexico.ks and get the track for Once Upon a Time in Mexico.
0312323859|5.0|This is a continuation of the book Something Borrowed.<br /><br />Something Borrowed is about two friends one who was always the center of attention and the other who let her be. She was the smart one. In this book, the friends rent a house in Hamptons for the summer,Darcy and her fiance Dex and Rachel.

This story is told in Darcy's point of view.  She feels completely betrayed by her best friend, not to mention her fiance.  She tries to make a go of it with the man who impregnated her, but he was just in it for the \\"heat\\" of the moment, and not the long haul so Darcy sets off for England to be with another friend of the three friends from school. Ethan- there she finds herself and her self worth after another failed relationship and hearing the real truth about herself!  Boy was she shocked!<br /><br />The ending is great, and it ties this story of the friends in a nice little bow.<br /><br />I would recommend these two books to anyone!
B000002UAR|5.0|With Sgt Pepper, The Beatles perfected the psychedelic sound of the 60s but before that they were experimenting with it on this landmark release. The Beatles combine some of everything on this record; hard rock, baroque pop, Indian music, acid inspired numbers, sunshine pop, pop/rock, and even children's sing-a-longs. A very tightly constructed album, not one song seems out of place yet the variety is incredible compared to most other records made at that time. <br /> <br />The album both rock harder and mellows out more than any of its predecessor. George Harrison turns out some of his best songwriting with the hard rocker, \\"Taxman\\", with its paranoid lyrics about the British tax system, ponding chords, and energy driven guitar solo. \\"I Want To Tell You\\", is a mellow yet somewhat eerie pop tune and, \\"Love You Too\\", is a foray into Indian music that rivals Harrison's, \\"Within You, Without You\\", on the Sgt Pepper album. Eleanor Rigby is an entirely string driven song with one of the most well developed storys ever to grace a Beatles song. \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", is a drugged induced song that John Lennon wrote after a long trip and did nothing but sleep for days. \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\", was once stated by Art Garfunkel to be the best song ever written. The instrumentation in the song plays second-fiddle to the beautiful harmonies that rival even the Beach Boys.  <br /> <br />\\"Yellow Submarine\\", is a cute little Ringo Starr tune that rivals anything heard on Sesame Street. The boys just have fun on this song more than ever with its silly sound effects and music-hall chorus. \\"She Said, She Said\\", is another druggish song with its whirlwind of guitar riffs and repeated chorus lines. \\"Good Day, Sunshine\\" a McCartney number I saw him perform during his 2005 tour is a simple sunshine pop song about enjoying out door life. \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", is yet another psychedelic song with its distorted guitar riffs and, \\"For No One\\", is a very simple yet effective and beautiful McCartney pop number about lost love told from the third person (yet another song I saw him perform on his tour). \\"Doctor Robert\\", is a simple Rock-n-Roll ditty about a man who perscribes illegal drugs. \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\", (yet another song I saw McCartney perform at the concert) is another short song with its fun horn section and catchy melody. This all leads to one of the most wild and druggish trip you've ever experienced. \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\", with its ponding drums, unidentified noises, backwards guitars, and distorted vocals taken from the Tibetan Book Of Death, takes you to the other side of reality, even more so than the rest of the album.  <br /> <br />I don't think any other album made up to this point or since then has had as much variety and so much to offer than this one did. This is proof you don't need to take LSD to experience the full blown force of the 60s psychedelic era <br /> <br />
B00008WT5E|3.0|Ever since this summer, i have been on a simple quest. A quest to buy all of the AC/DC cds. I don't have all of them, but of the ones I own, powerage is definately not the best. I'm not going to call it the worst, because AC/DC doesn't make bad music. I'm just gonna say that all of the AC/DC cds are better and much more fun to listen to. This cd has more a dark tone to it, which I thought was cool, but didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would because I like when bands try different stuff. Of the Bon Scott era of AC/DC I would recommend \\"Let There Be Rock\\" or \\"Highway to Hell\\" instead. This is not an AC/DC album you must have. Only if you're trying to get all of them as I am.
B000002UB3|5.0|The glory of the Beatles has never shined better then on their last studio album, \\"Abbey Road\\".  Ranked as one of the best Albums of all times, this incredible record hasn't aged a day since it was first released in 1969.   At 18 I am probably One of the youngest Beatles fans on earth.  While my peers are listening to Hip-Hop and Death-Metal, (Which can't even really be classified as music in my opinion), I'm listening to the sound that all modern music has been built upon.   <br />   In agreement with many of the reviewers the album comes to life with George Harrison's contributions; \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes The Sun\\".  \\"Something\\" is one of the most beautiful love ballads ever written and  \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" is the Beatles at their most hopeful and happiest moment.  The juxtaposition of \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" and \\"Because\\" is unbelievable.  \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" is so bright while \\"Because\\" is one of the Beatles darkest yet most beautiful numbers.  \\"Oh! Darling\\" features one of Paul's most powerful vocal performences.  He had to get up early in the morning so his voice would sound hoarse in the recording studio.  The second side of the album is great with each short song flowing right into the next.  Even some of the lesser known tracks such as \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" outrank most of the garbage made nowdays. <br />    This album has an almost prog-rock feel to it when compared to the psychedelic preferences of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" or even \\"Revolver\\".  A very unique album in every possible way. <br />    Everybody should own a copy of this album.  If you don't, your missing out on one of the greatest musical experiences ever created. <br />
B000002H97|5.0|If you like rock music and Metal music in particular, you have to buy this one. Maybe the best album from Metallica!!
B0007P3582|4.0|Honestly, who doesn't know who 50 Cent is these days?  He is everywhere, what with his Shoes, Clothes, Drinks, Movies, and of course Music.  People are naturally going to hate on him.  Now I don't love the guy and he is far from my favorite rapper; however, he is unjustly judged.  Since Get Rich or Die Tryin', everyone has been trying to knock him off the top.  Fortunatley, his G-Unit crew held everything down with their great individual albums.  So, eventually 50 got around to releasing his sophmore effort, The Massacre.  People started hating as soon as it was released, probably without even really listening to it.  I know I did.  I listened to it, but I didn't really pay attention.  As time went on however, I listened to it more and more and this album just got better with time.  It isn't a classic album, but 50 didn't fall into the sophmore slump with this album.  I personally like every song on the album.  It is one of the better G Unit releases, because 50's sing song flow is very catchy and he has a penchant for writing catchy choruses.  I think it is a very likable album and very entertaining.  Buy It.

0679720200|5.0|The flat affect of Camus' prose sometimes makes him seem less a writer than a philosopher creating parable or sisyphian allegory. Yet contemporary writers might emulate his devastating calm more often. Camus' only religion is the elemental--light, heat, effort, and movement--and in those basics he saw all he needed to create a story...because we are all makings of the sun. Just before the murder at the core of the novel, and the narrator's asserts that \\"To stay, or to make a move--it came to much the same\\" sets the scene for the senseless act three pages later. This moment, however, is no mere \\"telling\\"; it succinctly describes the emotional inertia, exhaustion of will, and nausea to which humans fall prey. Knowing how it really feels to have meaning drop away, he knows any more elaborate description would seem false. What is more, he says just enough to make the murder both understandable and baffling. Camus' triumph--not just as a philosopher but also as a writer--is telling his tale and feeling its truth.
014028009X|4.0|This book is a nice diary about Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) in her 30s, facing a difficulties in her love life.

She has to make a decision, a difficult decision, that will change her life. <br /> <br />This book is written in dates, just like a personal journal or diary. The details of things and people around her are described in detail. Some humors and funny terms are found in her diary, making it fun to read along her diary. <br /> <br />Overall, the story in her diary is not so special, but you can learn something new from her diary, her life. You learn new things about relationship and love life. This book will be more meaningful and heart-touching for those who are in work life and may be facing the same problem as Bridget Jones.
0156027321|4.0|A glance at this book's cover in an airport newsstand reveals the premise of Martel's novel, but by now everyone knows it anyway--a boy and a Bengal tiger share a lifeboat during their over seven month sea voyage. The book is an odd combination of fantasy and reality, detailed in its attention to contents of a survival kit and the floating mass of manna/seaweed that proves parasitic of its meerkat (and human) inhabitants. For the most part, Martel balances real and fantastic well, suspending disbelief confidently by just assuming it...until Japanese investigators seek to know \\"what happened.\\"  I almost cried when, in the face of the investigator's objections, Pi retells his tale \\"without the animals,\\" undoing what the book worked so well to achieve and making the novel into an explicit allegory. I still loved this book, but I was sorry to see it end with an inexplicable loss of confidence.

B00005JODA|4.0|Tonight I rode around my city looking for a movie. I was disappointed that there were no blockbuster, big budget films playing, so I decided to see the Constant Gardener playing in a fine arts theatre.   <br /> <br />Before the movie started I keep thinking, I hope I didn't waste <br />my money again on a bad film. I was pleasantly surprised at the great acting and the interesting plot of this film, even though <br />the plot is heartwrenching.  This film uses many flashbacks, <br />which I usually detest, but I think the flashbacks enhanced it. <br /> <br />I read most of the reviews here, and there are legitimate  <br />critques by the reviewers regarding plot, camera work, preachiness, etc. but I enjoyed it anyway.  It's far better than the usual crap Hollywood is making these days.         <br /> <br />

With pure hip hop beats to go with them. 50 cent has the nerve to say he's the king of Queens. Nas is the true king of Queens and New York. I first heard this album back in 1995, and I've been listening to it every since. If you haven't heard Illmatic, then you dont know what real hip hop is.

B00005JNZP|3.0|Milan Kundera once wrote that modern novelists should write in such a way that their books should be un-filmable - that the essence of the novel should be something that can't translate to the screen.  Jonathan Safran Foer certainly took his advice in writing Everything is Illuminated: a metafictional novel with a ton of bells and whistles that couldn't translate to the screen.  It certainly seemed un-filmable...and then they went and filmed it.  If I were to assign a director for such a task, it would have been someone like David Fincher who (with Fight Club) proved that he could take literary tricks and give us their cinematic equivalents.  Instead, we have Liev Schreiber - an actor who uses this project for his first attempt at being a writer AND director (he's never done either before).  The results are mixed. <br /> <br />The novel had three different storylines: there was the correspondence from Alex to Jonathan, there was the history of the shtetl of Trachimbrod, and there was the main story of the modern-day journey (\\"a very rigid search\\") for Trachimbrod.  In order to make the story filmable, Schrieber has only retained the modern-day storyline and ignored all the metafictional gimmicks: thus we are left with about two or three dimensions out of twenty. <br /> <br />DOES THE MOVIE WORK ON ITS OWN MERITS?  Kind of.  It's funny.  The best character is Alex Perchov, played by Eugene Hutz who - in real life - is a non-actor; he's the front man for a gypsy/punk/folk band (his song plays over the ending credits).  He was the funniest character in the book and he makes a good transition to the screen: a track-suit-wearing, gold-chained-and-toothed Ukrainian hip hop kid who speaks his own unique brand of English.  Most of the humor comes from the culture clash between him and Jonathan.  The character of Jonathan is drastically changed for the screen.  Schreiber makes him come across like the creepy intern undertaker from Six Feet Under.  He puts huge glasses over Elijah Wood's already-huge eyes, making him look like a cartoon character. <br /> <br />What doesn't work is the emotional center of the film.  It feels like something is missing.  It goes from light comedy to tragedy, but the tragedy isn't done well.  This is perhaps because they COMPLETELY changed the ending of the book.  They not only removed the bells and whistles - they also removed its heart.  The character of the grandfather gets totally changed, so no one really gets his epiphany at the end (even if you have read the book).  I don't understand why this was done - perhaps it was thought the ending was too much of a downer. <br /> <br />Everything is Illuminated isn't a bad film.  It's very amusing in parts and is better than the summer drivel that preceded it.  But, I think a lot of people will end up waiting for it on home video. <br />

It is what on Christopher's mind. His left brain is dominant while his right brain, where the emotions are, is not well developed. As a result, he loves math, logic, and everything that is organized and in order. Meanwhile, he doesn't like being touched, can't understand facial expression, and emotionally numb.    Reading this novel gives you different point of view of this world. After reading this book, you will know how the information around us are being absorbed differently by the mind of an autism boy. You will also know better why they don't like visiting new places, don't like mixing up with people, and sometimes being cruel.    It's fun to read this book on your spare time.
B00006G8K0|5.0|This is the first,and best, movie in the Dracula cycle that Hammer Studios made.The direction,acting,production and screenplay are all excellent. It may not follow the novel Dracula exactly, but that does not diminish the greatness of this film. Christopher Lee is both frightening and sexy at the same time, making his portrayal of Dracula one of the best ever on screen. I still get spooked watching this movie and I have seen it dozens of times. <br /> <br />If you see this movie you will get hooked on Hammer films......and that is a good thing! :-) <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JM02|5.0|This is the 2nd best animated cartoon film (the 1st on is The Incredibles) I have ever seen! The story plot is clearly and well developed. The character and its animation is drawn in great detail. Color selection for backgrounds and characters is well chosen, making it \\"live\\" and attractive. This movie is not only for kids, the adults will love this film too! Entertaining, Funny, Refreshing, and a little bit heart-touching. <br /> <br />The supporting soundtracks were also great. :-) The one that I like most is the ending song, \\"Beyond the Sea\\" by Robbie Williams.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|I was forced to go see this movie when it was first released and I laughed through the whole thing. The acting is terrible and I could,in no way, feel any sympathy for any of the characters. The screenplay is awful and there are huge gaps in the story that are never resolved. <br /> <br />Go see a Hammer Studios vampire flick, such as Taste The Blood Of Dracula. You'll thank me.

B000AL730O|4.0|This is one of those projects from McCartney that we all have been looking for (us McCartney fans that is). As I always say \\"the best albums are the ones you have to listen to several times and let them grow on you\\"  then you get to feel the atmosphere. It's a good album for people who like to \\"listen\\" to music not just be entertained. The problem is the way it has been promoted, sounds like \\"White Album, Let It Be, McCartney, Ram\\".  Give me a break.  We need to understand that we have to take Paul McCartney in context of where HIS life is right now, not try and regress him back to 1971.  Let's take Paul right where he is, a 63 year old musician who is growing old very gracefully.  He is not going through the same things he was when he was 30.  Listen to his lyrics in these songs and as John said \\"proves that Paul can write lyrics if he's a good boy\\".  You will also hear Paul in these last years thinking about God, notably \\"Motor of Love\\" on \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\" and \\"Follow Me\\" on this project.  Paul is still very open minded in his 60's.  I think one of the greatest statements about this album is that Paul's well has not run dry.  So he's not on the billboard top 40, do we really want him there? He doesn't need our money, he has nothing to prove, but, listen to this album and you will hear a man full of love for his family, his wife and his friends from years ago, friends that used to hang out in the back yard with him and play Buddy Holly songs. He loves his work, thats why he still does it, what's he supposed to do, sell insurance? For someone who never took a single lesson of any kind on any instrument in his life, he is by far one of the greatest musicians in the world.  Everyone who loves music should own a Paul McCartney solo album. This one is one of those albums.
B00005JNDZ|4.0|I have read part of Bridget Jones's Diary novel and I like it. Then I decided to watch the DVD and I like it even more. Suitable soundtracks are being played on some occasions on the movie, making it more heartrending. This movie is best viewed in Widescreen TV and don't forget the popcorn. <br /> <br />On the main menu there are some bonus features: <br /> <br />- Behind The Scenes <br />You can see some scenes that are not included on the movie, actor and actress commentaries, and some funny things on the making of this movie. <br /> <br />- Bridget Jones Articles <br />The articles of Bridget Jones Diary is available here. You can read them and they are similar with those in Bridget Jones's Diary novel. <br /> <br />- Three Music Video <br />If you like the soundtracks, you'll love this feature. You can playback three music video clip of soundtracks that are played during the movie. Two of them are \\"Killin' Kind\\" and \\"Out Of Reach\\"
B00003CXP1|5.0|but still enjoyed it.  Bought it as a gift for a cousin but still watched it before I gave it to her.  It's really freaky but one of those that you say to yourself \\"DAMN THAT WAS MESSED UP BUT GOOD\\".
B000AAJTL6|5.0|Are you looking for a good UMD movie? Then please pick this one up for your PSP. This is one of the best movies ever made. Unfortunately Disney isn't making anymore Toy Story movies... :( <br /> <br />If you haven't seen the Toy Story movies, then pick this one up! <br /> <br />5 out of 5 stars
B0000019PA|5.0|\\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" is the single closest thing to a religious experience that I have ever encountered while listening to an album. From start to finish Jeff Mangum takes you to a different world, a world like you have never imagined. It may take a listen or two to get used to his unorthadoxed voice and style, but rest assured, it is well worth it. This album provides a variety of unidentifiable feelings and emotions, it is almost like there is an invisible presence around you as you listen. Sometimes you will feel happy, others sad, and even more so strange. In fact, I really can't put my finger on how this record makes me feel.  The harrowing tales of love (In the Aeroplane Over the Sea) and pain (Two Headed Boy) lead into an orgy of musical emotions. It is a shame that not everyone on the plannet can apprciate this masterpiece. It should be required listening for anyone who appreciates real music and ral art.  In an era where most music is shallow and art is an over-used term, Jeff Mangum and Neutral Milk Hotel have created a genious musical masterpiece.
B00006FM77|5.0|The wait is finally over. For almost 30 years I have been craving some unreleased live Terry Kath tracks to be released. With this new edition of Chicago At Carnegie Hall, my wish has been granted! There is included, in this new re-release, a bonus disc of unreleased and alternate take tracks, on which, the guys really shine. The interplay between Terry Kath and drummer Danny Seraphine is amazing, but really, so is the playing of the entire band. Some of the other reviews here already say it all, but I just have to comment on one of the reviews from a guy named Laurence Babbin. Lawrence, maybe you should try actually buying the discs, rather than just burning them on your computer. That's why there are those annoying little breaks you refer to. On my \\"real\\" store bought version, the long connected pieces flow, as intended. To anyone else out there, don't let his comments deter you from buying this outstanding work. There ARE slight breaks between the tracks on the bonus disc, but that's because it is comprised of takes from different shows they played at Carnegie Hall in that one week. This is great live rock music from a time when great live rock music mattered (and you didn't need to be a millionaire to afford a ticket in those days!)......TERRY KATH LIVES!!!
B000002LCB|5.0|We used this cd as our wedding song, so we need not to say any more. We love this CD. We used it as our first song and our wedding march.
B000002U82|5.0|This album is incredible, all tracks are really good, no matter what kind of music you usualy listen to, you'll love this. This album is almost alien, the music is nothing like I've ever heard before, I was so suprised when I loved it so much. The vocals guitar, and everything are just amazing, this album is what we will use to make peace with aliens when they land on earth.... truly amazing, buy it!
B000AL730O|2.0|Wow...what a letdown. This album is nothing spectacular. I'm talking music only--not even counting Paul's voice or lyrics. I'm wondering what kind of person gives this kind of album rave reviews? I'm a big McCartney fan, but there must be people that blindly love everything that falls out of this man's mouth.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day in my opinion is some of the best punk rock, in particular, this album. It;s really amazing how good this album is considering that, the drums are mediocre, the bass is mediocre, and the guitar is mediocre, the vocals are pretty good, but it's really the bands ability to make great songs and coordinate that makes this album, and this band. They work perfectly together and write great lyrics, and all of that shows in this album. Im my opinion, this album is even better than Dookie.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|The movie version could do a lot more compared to the stage version but could see why it did not take off after watching the documentaries in the second DVD.  Joel wanted younger actors probably to reach out to a younger audience but in the end it ended up neither here nor there.  The younger actors were technically all there but they lacked the depth and warmth of a sarah brightman or michael crawford.  Lesson learned here; never miscast just to get commercial appeal.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Incredible, she's re defined the word musician. To a lot of stupid people, which are growing fewer and fewer, this is considered something special. :) In my opinion this is something so ridiculous it should be illegal. This is almost worse than rap. People listening to rich un talented losers like her and rappers with fake little drum machines and billion dollar microphones.<br /><br />And as for the music itself, personally i prefer the barny theme song....
0743487478|5.0|Children stand on their legs and adults will stand on their brains.<br />A 5-year old grandchild, given the opportunity, knows better (not better, as in a comparison, but better in knowing the world as it is at any given moment) than grown-ups who act and think on mere suggestion.<br />The world draws upon your curiosity. Any grandparent who pays attention knows (not as in logical argument) this. That's what grandchildren teach them. That's all.
B00004W52U|5.0|The first time I ever heard this album, I will never forget. I was at a party, and all of a sudden, track 5, the Crowd comes on, by Operation ivy, and I'm just blown away. I had no idea I liked punk rock or ska before this. Buying this album was the best 15$ i've ever spent. For me, this is right up there with London Calling, better than the clash, I might even like it more than Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, which is saying a lot because I worship Pink Floyd. Matt Freeman is an incredible bass player, and him and Tim have earned themselves a life long respect just beacuse of this album.If you haven't caught on, this is a album for the ages, this music will live on, I garuntee it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album to anyone.
0312084986|5.0|This book is a timeless treasure; a masterpiece of folksy writing that just draws you in and makes you feel truly comfortable. You can just see yourself watching in the background and Herriot tackles everything from delivering young lambs to minor surgery on horses. A reader feels connected in a way that is remarkable.<br /><br />I have no idea how many times I've read this book in the last 10 years, but I've no doubt that I'll continue to read it on occasion for as long as I draw breath.<br /><br />Just a marvelous adventure.
B0000028RR|4.0|Exellent album, Rage's best work. This cd doesn't have a single bad song on it, all metal classics.<br /><br />The fusuion between heavy metal and hip hop is absalutely amazing here, with ausome vocals and lyrics, some absalutely kick ass guitar effects, and a bass line that makes you want to headbang.<br /><br />Drum are ausome too, I mean, of all my cds, probably this, and Evil Empire are my greatest cds in the collection.<br /><br />Album Highlights....<br />Every track,<br />but in particular....<br /><br />Bullet In The Head<br />Killing in The Name of<br />Bombtrack<br />and Freedom
B000AL730O|4.0|Well, I've listened to the album about 12 times through so far and here's my song for song review. A little background, I am 33 and have been a fan since I was about 8 when I bought my \\"Capitol swirl\\" 45rpm of Eight Days a Week/I Don't Want to Spoil the Party. My first official McCartney new release purchase was Tug of War and I've anxiously awaited every album since. I remember where I was when I heard that Lennon was shot. I've seen McCartney on every tour he's done since the late 80s (I think that's like 3 separate tours)- all in the NY/NJ/CT/MA area.. (Giants Stadium, MSG, Hartford, Boston). I saw him 3 times during the last tour which I thought was his best outside of the Beatles and Wings shows I've seen on video.  <br />So with that- no apologies- McCartney is competition only to himself, but he's certainly not in peak voice anymore and I think he relies too much on falsetto these days. This is not the Oh Darling! or Maybe I'm Amazed voice anymore. Still, I enjoy and look forward to everything he puts out. I've got just about every bootleg imaginable and have purchased just about everything I can (I even bought two copies of Driving Rain so I could have both covers). So that being said, here's my review of McCartney's latest \\"Chaos and Creation.\\" 4/5 Stars.  <br /> <br /> <br />Fine Line  <br />Pros: Good verse hook, nice piano rhythm  <br />Cons: Can get repetitive and a little annoying after too many listens. The 5.1 mix isn't anything special compared with TOUP type mixes.  <br /> <br />How Kind of You  <br />Pros: Complex instrumentation overlaps  <br />Cons: Dirge like tempo, McCartney sounds like he's dying in the opening chorus and throughout most of the song.  <br /> <br />Jenny Wren  <br />Pros: Great improv finger-picking song which gets catchier the more you hear it. No so simple as to become boring.  <br />Cons: Not as good or catchy as Blackbird, maybe a bit too much falsetto voice  <br /> <br />At the Mercy  <br />Pros: Great inflections in hisvoice that bring a whole new side to McCartney- The verse \\"If you show me how\\" is classic McCartney  <br />Cons: Horrible opening chorus makes you want to skip past the song  <br /> <br />Friends to Go  <br />Pros: Up tempo and catchy with great self-harmonies- I can certainly hear Harrison's influence in this song  <br />Cons: Too Short  <br /> <br />English Tea  <br />Pros: Catchy and Poppy and nearly impossible to get out of your head. The \\"Miles and miles of English Garden\\" verse is another classic point  <br />Cons: Demonstrates that the Rutles were on to something, if you play this as a good song to a non-McCartney fan, they'll think you've gone loopy - especially with the \\"Hip-Hooray\\" and the quirky flute solo that belongs in a Spinal Tap song..  <br /> <br />Too Much Rain  <br />Pros: Nice guitar flow, another catchy song with a nice progression - great theme song for hurricane victims.  <br />Cons: Lyrics are a bit over the top on the cheesy side or just plain bad \\"Laugh when your eyes are burning?\\"  <br /> <br />A Certain Softness  <br />Pros: Unique McCartney effort and somewhat risky but it works - great cross fading of vocals  <br />Cons: Could have benefited from a better Spanish guitar musician on a solo or in background throughout the song. Take about 3-4 listens before you realize the genius of this song  <br /> <br />Riding to Vanity Fair  <br />Pros: Intelligent lyrics, very atypical McCartney - would probably make a great Lennon-McCartney duet.  <br />Cons: Too Long, this song shows that his voice is shot. \\"I keep hoping for friend-ship\\" &lt;cough> &lt;cough>. Too much falsetto.  <br /> <br />Follow Me  <br />Pros: \\"Down the track of loneliness\\" verse  <br />Cons: More sappy over the top McCartney lyrics  <br /> <br />Promise To You Girl  <br />Pros: Great time changes and Beatles reminiscent harmonies, one of the few upbeat tunes on the album  <br />Cons: Lyrics in verse are a little choppy and don't flow together well  <br /> <br />This Never Happened Before  <br />Pros: Classic McCartney that sounds like something out of the Tug of War/Pipes of Peace sessions - maybe a lost B side that could have been on Pizza and Fairy Tales. Well written, great progression, great voice, great self-harmony.  <br />Cons: If you're in a get up and go mood, this song gets skipped  <br /> <br />Anyway  <br />Pros: Great follow-up to \\"This Never Happened Before\\" - the song is very polished  <br />Cons: It's the last song on the album! Quick- go get the B-sides! <br />
B000066F6H|2.0|This album is probably THE best instrumental album I've ever heard, and it's ausom how this band is from Sweden. So I always find myself thinking what a kik a** band when I start listening to the track, while the bass is rocking like crazy and the drums are doing godlike things, and then, I face sinks, as the vocals come in....<br /><br />The vocals in this album are the worst I've ever heard, and i really hate to say that. The instrumentals are so incredible, but this vocalist hurts your ears, and it won;t grow on you. I've tried, many times, to love this allbum, and i just can't, I wish this band would find a new vocalist so I could worship them.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Honestly I can say that every single song on this cd is just purely amazing. With amazing songs like \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", \\"Sweet Child O Mine\\", and \\"Paradise City\\", this cd really is the greatest hits, please by this album GNR fans. <br /> <br />ps. MAY THE TROLL BE WITH YOU. <br /> <br />- FATHER SIROSIS.
B000089CJI|3.0|While I find this musical experiment resulting from collaboration over mail to be interesting, I've only found a handful of songs that I would consider memorable on it. There's too much of a conscious effort to have an 80s sound on it, making it too artificial at times, in spite of the great melodies and lyrical work that Ben Gibbard typically delivers.<br /><br />The most notable songs in the album, besides the classic \\"Such Great Heights\\" (perhaps one of the best songs in 2003), contain contributions from Rilo Kiley's Jenny Lewis (i.e. the opening track and \\"This Place Is A Prison\\"). Also well worth listening is the mostly instrumental and progressive electronic track closing the album. But four songs don't make up an album. I give it three stars. I stick to Death Cab for Cutie for now.
B00005MM01|5.0|Excellent condition.  Clear CD. Album cover a booklet included. As if bought from a well-corporated electronics store.
1558908366|1.0|I don't like bashing moves, I am aware that we all have different tastes and the fact that I dislike a movie doesn't mean it's bad. But I cannot help myself when it sends wrong message. This is the case with  PRETTY WOMAN!      It is absolutely wrong to glamorize prostitution!  My heart goes to the women who make this bad choice, because it is out of desperation, or naivety and  with  consequences for a lifetime. The prostitutes experience sex in its ugliest form and probably never know the beauty of real lovemaking. Their reality is very different of what this film depicts, especially the reality of the streetwalkers. It's lonely, risky, dirty, humiliating existence and every attempt to glamorize it and compare it with Cinderella's story is an insult on human intelligence!    The plot and the characters are shallow, not to mention Vivien's dumb and unbelievable behaviour in the hotel's lift where she insults strangers who happen to be hotel guests, while her employer Edward simply smiles stupidly. Her best friend, also a prostitute, demonstrates the same bad manners, which shows that this is their nature. Still, somehow Vivien manages to transform herself to a fine lady in no time. Oh please, get real! It never works that way!    One star for the music score, it is quite nice!
B000000W5P|5.0|Im not going to sit here telling you how this is there best album. But i love the songs, they have alot of more poP -garagey type sounds going on. i love the sound of this album  when im stoned. i also recommend Let It Bleed(GREAT ALBUM FROM 1969)
B000ASATWQ|5.0|This albulm is straight fire. Damian has progressed from singing his dad's song with his dad's style in \\"Mr. Marley\\" to his completely own style with \\"Halfway Tree\\" and \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\".  I didnt think he could outdo \\"Halfway Tree\\" with blazin tracks like It was written and Born to be wild. I was wrong just listen to the opening song confrontation my new favorite song by jr gong he spits fire. Also road to zion is ill. Every track is sick bottom line.  He brings it raw and has developed into one of the best in reggae. Also damian marley is one of the best in concert.
B00005AQE8|1.0|2pac is wack. He's no where near Biggie or Nas. People need to realize this. 2pac was all about image, his music was garbage. Buy \\"Ready To Die\\" or \\"Illmatic\\" instead.
B00005JOHU|5.0|This movie is a superb look at a man who sells guns for a living to all countries and the bad/good choices he makes in his life. <br /> <br />Watching this film gives you a deep insight into how rival countries get the weapons they get. You are taken into a journey into a dark world full of corruption and violence. <br /> <br />Pegged in the middle of it is Nicholas Cage's character, Yuri Orlov. We get to see his 40 year life span as he evolves from a peasant working at the family restaurant to a gun-selling \\"maniac\\" who becomes deeply obsessed into what he does. We see that as he becomes more induced into this dark, violent world of weapons, we his soul become darker as well. He lies to his wife and betrays the people he sells guns to. Yuri sells his guns to both sides of wars and states that he doesn't care who has the guns, it's that their using them. This is probably one of Nicholas Cage's finest and trickiest performances. <br /> <br />This film feels like Scarface in the sense of a lower-class man starting out with minimal earnings and working his way up in a business most people would shun away from. Ethan Hawke plays a cop who is desperate to put him away. But, Yuri is always one step ahead of him in hiding all of his guns and evidence to prevent Hawke from getting any real evidence out of him. <br /> <br />This is a very intelligent script with an intriguing premise that will plug you right into Yiri Orlov's life and well send you deeper into the corrupt, immoral man he becomes.

B00006690G|5.0|KIDS WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST THING ON YOU'RE BIRTHDAY OR CHRISTMAS LIST THIS YEAR, CORRECT, EMINEM'S \\"THE EMINEM SHOW\\". This is a classic album that started ut all. This was the prequel to \\"Encore\\", another one of Marshall's best cd's, infact I don't think he's ever made an album that has'nt been a hit. Both the Marshall, and the Slim Shady LPs, Encore, and The Eminem Show, all classics.  <br /> <br />1. Curtains Up- N/A.  <br />2. White Amreica- A great opening song for the great cd. 5/5 <br />3. Business- Features the great Dr. Dre, great beat. 5/5 <br />4. Cleanin' Out My Closet- ONe of the singles on this cd. 5/5 <br />5. Square Dance- Intereting song, nice rhythm. 5/5 <br />6. The Kiss- N/A. <br />7. I'm A Soldier- Not one of my favorites. 2/5  <br />8. Say Goodbye TO Hollywood- An average song on this cd. 3/5 <br />9. Drips- One of the better songs. 3.5/5 <br />10. Without Me- Maybe the best Eminem song ever to be written, my favorite. 10/5 <br />11. Paul Rosenberg- N/A. <br />12. Sing For The Moment- One of the absolute best songs by him. 5/5 <br />13. Superman- One of the best songs on the album. 4.5/5 <br />14. Haily's Song- This and Mockingbird are the best Hailey songs. 5/5 <br />15. Steve Berman- N/A. <br />16. When The Music Stops- One of the best songs, featuring the great D12. 4.5/5 <br />17. Say What You Say- A hit song on the album. 5/5 <br />18. Till I Collapse- One of The Best SOngs done by Em. 5/5 <br />19. My Dad's Gone Crazy- Features his daughter Hailey, good beat. 5/5 <br />20. Curtains Close- N/A. <br /> <br />Overall this is one amazing album, highly recomended, your's truly, <br /> <br />PIRATE
1577312082|5.0|I listened to the audio version of this book over a one week period, mostly as I was driving around.  It had a profound effect on my life.  I have practiced and taught meditation for many years, and a few times at retreats I have entered what are called ecstatic spiritual states.  Listening to this recording brought me back to those states each time.  If they were written the words he is speaking might or might not have that power.  I have never read the typed version, so I don't know if it is the writing itself.  But I cannot justify removing even one star from my rating of this item.  There is simply nothing to fault it for when it delivers more than what one reasonably expects to get out of a book.  The book will give you an experience of what he is talking about. What more do you want?  Isn't the point of knowledge to gain access to the experience?  So what if your mind can't eloquently explain advanced spiritual theories to others after listening to this.  You can embody what he is teaching instead!  Let your being speak for you. <br /> <br />Now maybe not everyone would have this experience from listening to these recordings.  Perhaps all those years of meditation practice has made me more receptive to the \\"transmission\\" Tolle is giving as he reads the book to us.  Or maybe it is only because I have accessed these states previously at retreats, so my spiritual self just has to be reminded to return to that state.  I don't know, but I do know that the possibility of being able to have this experience yourself, especially if for the first time, has got to be worth the $30 it will cost you to buy this audio-book.  I spent a heck of a lot more than that on all those retreats!  You won't be enlightened after hearing this audio-book, but you will at least get to have quite a few enlightened moments while listening to it.  I am coming to understand more and more that that is the promise of the spiritual journey... the moments... not the goal of 100% stability in onestate of being at all times.  Tolle can't give you enlightenment, but he can give you a powerful experience of yourself in this moment. <br /> <br />On top of that, I did find many of the ideas to be important reminders.  We all need reminders of our spiritual teachings.  The programming system of the world's reality system is always being broadcast at us, so we need to balance that every day.  This book was filled with things I need to hear again and again.  I recommend it highly to beginners and advanced practitioners alike.
0425206211|4.0|Next up in my catch-up reading of Lee Child is Die Trying, the second book in the Jack Reacher series.  As with the first one I read, it's a good \\"mind-candy\\" read...<br /><br />Reacher happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time in Chicago.  He attempts to help a woman coming out of a dry cleaners shop with an armful of clothes and a pair of crutches.  At the same time, two other people show up with plans on abducting the woman.  Since Jack just happens to be there and appears to be paired with her, he ends up going along for the ride.  He eventually figures out she's an FBI agent, recovering from a knee injury, and is also the daughter of a very well-known general in the US military.  The kidnappers belong to a militia group who want to use her to extract concessions from the government, chief of which is the formation of their own country within the borders of Montana.  Regardless of how much of a pain she is, they can't afford to kill her.  Reacher's another story, however...<br /><br />This is one of those books where everything works out right for the good guys and not so good for the bad guys.  I'm enjoying the character of Reacher, as well as Child's writing style...  rapid fire action and lines.  If you're looking for deep significance or intricate plotlines, you may be disappointed.  But if you just want to kick back and take an action ride, this book will get you there...
B000002KGT|4.0|Rumours~ Fleetwood Mac is a musically wonderfull album with the amazing vocals of Stevie Nicks and the muisicianship of John McVie (Bass), Lindsey Buckingham (Guitars and vocals), Mick Fleetwood (Drums, Percussion) and Christine McVie (Keyboards, Synthesizers). I would have loved to see what kind of equipment they used during the recording but this is unfortunately missing. The lyrics are quite good but can get a pit \\"simple\\" at times and they sing in many times about love and this seems a bit redundant. The major problem with this album is not the lyrics, the music or the vocals, but the terrible book-let which looks like a highschool project and the photographs look grainy but one has to realize that the technology back in the 70's was quite primitive and they did what they could with what they had. Even so the album gets 4 out of 5 stars since on the whole this is what it deserves.
1843532727|5.0|The best guide to Japan, from a resident of ten years in Hokkaido. I'm not refering to the coverage of Hokkaido, which is better than most guides available, but of the entire country. Should a visitor wish to see off the beaten track destinations, this guide will help  to take you there. The information is up to date and almost any aspect of travel in Japan, and difficulties of travel in Japan--there are many--is covered.  <br /> <br />Incidentally, but importantly, I'd like to point out that there is an error in an earlier review, which may or may not any longer be part of this list. An earlier reviewer gave an extremely low rating, which influences the entire average ratings total, based only on his reading of a few movie synopses contained within the book. Claiming the movie descriptions were wrong, he gives two examples. One of those examples was in error, because two movies called \\"Black Rain\\" have been made: one earlier movie was,just as the reviewer claimed, about the atomic bombings and their terrible aftermath. However, another more recent movie with the same title starred Michael Douglas and was indeed, contrary to the reviewer's critique, a suspense drama concerning Japanese yakuza. I have included this information so that no one should be influenced, when deciding whether or not to buy the book, by an inappropriately given rating of only a single star which must have dragged down the average ratings as a whole.
B00000JQFM|5.0|Joe Satriani, quite simply, is one of the most talented guitarists in the history of rock and roll. As a benchmark of just how great this album is, it's one of the only completely instrumental (possibly the only, as Satriani's next album, though it charted even better than 'Surfing', had four tracks with vocals) albums to break the top 40 album charts, peaking at #26, and gained gold certification. That may not seem like much, but to put it in perspective, try and think of an entirely instrumental album to sell over a million copies. Stumped? That's because due to the nature of pop music, it's difficult if not impossible to do unless you're really, really good. Satriani happens to be that good. Are you a Metallica fan? Have you ever wondered how Kirk Hammett learned to play guitar that well? Satriani taught him. <br /> <br />If you're still not convinced, I'll go into a bit more detail about the album itself. 'Surfing with the Alien' is a nonstop barrage of complex riffs, catchy melodies, and of course, unbelievable solos. There is literally not a weak track on this album, though some admittedly stand out more than others. Which isn't to say that this is a pretentious display of guitar wankery, on par with that of Yngwie Malmsteen, for instance. Satriani shows remarkable range in his songwriting, with straightforward, slightly jazzy rockers like 'Satch Boogie' and the title track, to introspective ballads (if you could refer to instrumentals as ballads) like 'Always with Me, Always with You', and 'Midnight'. 'Circles' is essentially a minute-and-a-half guitar solo with a minute of acoustic work tacked on either end, but the solo itself is so amazing that it doesn't feel like filler. <br /> <br />Satriani employs guitar synthesizers a LOT on this album, to give it a very spacey sound that fits well with the theme. Which isn't to say that this album doesn't rock, because Lord, does it ever. <br /> <br />In short, if you like classic rock virtuoso guitarists such as Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin and Eddie Van Halen, and are searching for a new shredder to idolize, look no further than Satriani. I recommend this album and his other masterpiece 'Crystal Planet' in the strongest terms possible, but his entire discography has very few missteps if you're willing to take the time to explore it.
1400031354|5.0|shipped same day, received two to three days after...A++++  BOOK IN GREAT CONDITION. BETTER THAN EXPECTED
B000AL730O|4.0|This was the first CD by Paul in a long time where I had heard that the critics actually liked it, so I had some preconceived expectations.  I'm 43 years old I caught Beatlemania in 1978 as a Sophmore in high School, this was at the height of Disco, Punk, the begining of Wave soon to be followed by Span-tex bands. My freinds would look at me sometimes like I was from another planet. Through all that, the only stuff that as truly stuck is those Beatles Records, the Wings records I grew up with and the Mccartney albums. Pauls had some great albums, some soso albums but also some real clunkers! (Wildlife, McCartney 2, Pipes of Peace). But through it all he always manages a few choice Nuggets. Chaos & Creation has a lot of Choice Nuggets! I admit I was a bit disappointed in the fact that I've been waiting for a GREAT album from him and I assumed a great album would contain a few rockers, this is not a physical record. What it lacks in rocking electric guitars it more then makes up for it in the music, the melodies, and in most cases the lyrics, complete songs that all stand on there own. The Toe tappers are Fineline, Friends to go, and the Beatles meet Queen, Promise to you girl. The ballads, This never happened which makes me start to hum \\"you never give me your money\\" and Anyway  great melodies simplistic lyrics. The two that sound most Beatle-like to me are Jenny Wren a great accoustical piece and English Tea, the latter is one of those songs you can't get it out of your head, but you'd just die if one of your friends heard you singing it. Paul always throws one of those in. The darker songs are At the mercy  and Riding to Vanity fair good stuff but you got to listen. And now for my favorite two tracks How kind of you, harkens to Revolver with that swirling back-ground loop that absolutely captivates and sucks me in, very positive song. and the Very best to me Too much rain, I think I've worn that song out playing it so much. Love the lyrics \\"Laugh while your eyes are burning\\"  the music & melody are awesome and when he gets to the line \\"To much rain\\" with the sad and strained vocal followed by the accoustic guitar chords enough said! I've played this cd way more then the last few, it so good it's made me go back to Flowers in the dirt and relisten, at 43 I now get \\"Rough ride, Distractions and We got married\\" which 15 years ago I couldn't stand. At 63 I think Paul can be pretty proud of this one. Don't think the kids will buy it and if you still want a lot of Beatlish rock go buy an Oasis or Jet Record.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|I, like nearly every other teenager on earth, am a massive fan of The OC. That is of course where i heard about Deathcab.  <br /> <br />I heard the song \\"A Lack of Colour\\" and really liked it. I listened to Deathcab's album, Transatlaticism and i have to say i didn't really like it. It had some really good songs on it, but, to me, it just wasn't a consistently good album. <br /> <br />I think this album is much more accessable to a wider audience. I am able to listen to this album all the way through without skipping a song and i think that is what a good album should be. <br /> <br />My favourite song would have to be Soul Meets Body. <br /> <br />I think this is a really good album and that moving to a major record label was a good decision for Deathcab. This, unlike transatlanticism, is a consistently good album.
B000AA4LAK|3.0|I love the Killers and I have been listening to them for a long time. But come on if your going to do a special edition give us more than a couple more songs and some art work. They could have put so much more stuff into this remixs(I mean they have done tones of Mr. Brightside remixes they could not even put one of those on) and some music videos (you know stuff to put in a special edition album) and more than just some artwork and three extra songs. Don't get me wrong I love the Killers I am giving this CD three stars not the Killers they are a ten star band no problem but come on give your fans something we will cherish for a long time. And like already eveyone has Hot Fuss (if you don't your really need to get out more) so your paying for a full album but you only get three songs and some artwork. So much more effort could have been put in without any effort at all! Really this is just another way to get more of a product out in as many hands as possible and for Island to make more MONEY!!! than actually give there fans what they want (I think the Killers had only some opinion in this if any, than what we think,). Even though the additional songs are really good just give us more. Lets just hope there working on there next BIG album and they were already busy. In the end this is for hardcore fans so... I guess it's still nice to have around.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Well, every person who's in for cinema knows that \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is a milestone picture. So it's obvious that you'd like to buy this one. And I won't tell about film itself - just a couple of words about this edition. I'd call it \\"All You Ever Wanted To Know About 'Dawn...'\\". Because here you have everything you could possibly desire. Commentaries, documentaries, galleries, trailers etc. EVERYTHING on 4 discs. The edition has three versions of the film - U.S. theatrical, extended and European. Extended is rather longer and has some bonus scenes but U.S. theatrical is what was prefered by George Romero himself so it's the one what this film was supposed to be from the very beginning. The European one was edited by Dario Argento and is slightly shorter than the others but it's not because Argento just shortened it - he cut out some footage but he inserted some more - some gory stuff. So it's not like this version is cut, don't be confused, it has some footage not available in other versions so it's interesting to watch anyway. They say there is some German version which is the extended plus Argento's footage but it was not possible to edit all this in potable way so this version is a total mess and is not necessary to watch. Anyway you have all that's needed here.<br />I don't think there will ever be some edition to top this one so buy it without any doubts. It is definately worth the money.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is Interpols first Album Turn On The Bright Lights and it is just a masterpiece. I love this one more than Antics. The songs are so dark and slow it just mixes so well and makes a sound that i have never herd before. Some of the Best songs are:    Untitled  NYC  PDA  Say Hello To The Angels  Stella Was A Diver and She was Always Done  Roland  The New    The songs are so perfect and you want to just here this over and over again. I also want to ask whats with the 1 stars i guess some people are just idiots and dont know what good music is even if you put them in front of a band. It makes me really mad when people say this band has no talent do not listen to them. Everyone has diffrent tastes in music but calling a band crap just because they dont like they way they sound is crazy and especialy this BAND there are great how could you not like them. This album is great period just buy it if you like this kind of music you will love Interpol Turn On The Bright Lights.
B000286RKW|5.0|Many people argue about what's better - \\"Goodfellas\\" or \\"Godfather\\". I guess there's no point in discussing this question. Every movie is great. \\"Goodfellas\\" might not be as sophisticated as \\"Godfather\\" but it shows the dreadful reality of a criminal's life. The film is brutal, ruthless and clever. Director's work is brilliant, maybe one of the best by Scorcese, the cast is outstanding - Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta and many others (many of them you could later see in \\"The Sopranos\\"). Part of the film's charm is that many scenes were ad-libbed by actors as said in bonus features. You'll definately want to rewind and watch them again. What's also interesting is that the movie is based on actual events and on memoirs of the real mafioso Henry Hill (who is played by Liotta here). By the way the disc has a commentary track by Hill so you can hear how it all happened in real life.<br /><br />One of the greatest mob movies, one of the greatest movies in general. True example of a downward spiral for a man who has chosen the wrong path. Don't miss it.
0062515675|5.0|There are so many self help books in the market! I have managed to read many of them. Even the good ones suffered from one fundamental weakness. Though the concepts are sound and the methods are good, these books failed in the implementation process - the reader fails to follow these methods in real life because he lacks some basic mental tools within; motivation, will power, self realization, confidence. Well, here's is the BOOK OF SELF HELP BOOKS (or rather the KING OF SELF HELP books)which gives you these mental tools! Read this book first; Then read any other self help book you finished before but could not follow. You will be surprised positively. This is what I have personally experienced.     Certainly this is a great book to read. You might have to pause here and there to absorb all the details. The story is a only skeleton framework. This book can not be read as a captivating, eye riveting story but as one great teacher of values so sadly missing in the lives of many people! As I started reading I unwittingly became Julian myself! I enjoyed the book as well as learned from it. Today, after two months, I am still regularly practicing the methods for development of concentration,focus and will power. I am happy to say that I have greatly benefited from it.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Yet Another mind blowing album.  This is killer!.... so many good hits including, Warning, Wish you were here, Are You In?, Nice to know you and Just a phase.  Just A phase is a song that i can listen to and it pleases me each and every single time.  This album is one where every song is listened to twice.  I love this band.. They have changed my life and i suggest you go and buy it.  CHEERS!!
B000AL730O|5.0|It's one of Paul's few consistent solo albums, alongside Band On The Run, Flowers In The Dirt, Off The Ground; not a single weak or unoriginal piece. Very listenable, elegant set that maintains a charming, pensive mood through the changes in pace. Although a real standout track is missing, it works extremely well as a whole and won't get stale. Jenny Wren is presumably about the Dickens character of that name in \\"Our Mutual Friend.\\"
B000002U9L|4.0|I loved this movie.  I agree with the poster below; this type of fantasy touches something in women.  We love this magic-guy-in-love-with-the-real-world-heroine story.  The music is haunting, mystical, sometimes silly (The Goblin Battle), and altogether wonderful.  Two of David Bowie's songs - \\"Chilly Down\\" and \\"Magic Dance\\" made me rate this four stars because I truly do not care for these two tunes.  The rest, however, paints a perfect picture of fantasy, especially the lovely \\"Sarah\\" the almost heartbreaking \\"Home at Last,\\" and the whole reason for buying the soundtrack, the stellar \\"As The World Falls Down.\\"  All in all, a damn good album.
1592400876|2.0|I picked this book up at book stores and put it down at least 6 times since it came out.  I just was NOT going to pay $20 for such a thin book.  I recently received a $150 Amazon gift card and figured I'd finally buy this book.  I even paid less than $13 for it!!! That was $12.94 I wish I had back.  \\"Laugh out loud funny?\\"; Hardly.  I usually \\"get\\" British humor.  I either didn't \\"get\\" any of the humor or it just wasn't there to \\"get\\".  If I had it to do all over, I would have borrowed it from the library.
B00000JCB2|5.0|this is one of those albums that has evry song is good. especially break stuff and 9 teen 90 nine. those songs kick @$$. so yea. i love this album. limp bizkit is an awsome band and i can't understand why people dont like them. they're an awsome band and their music is kick a$$. and people say that limp have changed over the years and gotten worse. well i dont believe that. they have changed but they are still the same band.  they havent gotten worse or better (well....maybe better) but just because they might sound different they're the same band (except for RMV) but just because they're style may have changed doesn't mean u should go and HATE them. im frikin sick and tired of hearding the same sh*t over and over about how limp bizkit sucks or how \\"I was a fan of Three Dollar Bill but then i started hating them because they sounded different.\\" gosh just shut up. its not like it hasn't been said about 30 bilion times. but anywayz, this cd is great. buy it. you'll like it.
B000002H2H|5.0|I still love Kill 'Em All, but Metallica's sophomore album is definitely superior. The lyrics are worlds better than their debut, and this album is also instrumentally superior. This album also includes my favorite Metallica instrumental, The Call Of Ktulu.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended to any metal head or anyone interested in the world of Metallica.
B00009V7P8|4.0|Wow!  I've discovered two great things in the last week--the television series \\"Lost\\" (which airs in the U.S.) and Damien Rice's \\"Delicate\\" which concludes the show in Episode 17.  Check out \\"Lost\\" and Damien--they are both great.
B000002H33|5.0|My favorite Metallica CD, without a doubt. Instrumentally and lyrically, this is still Metallica's strongest album. Orion isn't my favorite Metallica instrumental (The Call Of Ktulu, off of Ride the Lightning, is), but it is still a damn fine piece of music, and the rest of the songs (particularly the title track) are still icons in the metal world (and for damn good reason).    Very highly recommended.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I sadly missed this movie when it was out in theatres but had a chance to see it when it hit dvd. I absolutely loved it and just had to get the extended edition, which adds much to the originally wonderful movie.<br /><br />This vampire/werewolf horror story just oozes with unique twists, spectacular action, awesome environments, and mostly great acting.<br /><br />Beckinsale, as Selene, looked terrific, acted terrific, and really made the movie what it was. She played her action scenes well and made it look like she was an veteran action heroine.<br /><br />She played her parts with plenty of eye candy, flair, and grace to spare. A truly awesome performance on her part.<br /><br />Her love interest, Scott Speedman, was also great and he generated a great deal of believable emotion and reality in his transformation parts and his 'what the f is going on' parts.<br /><br />Likewise, the main 'bad guy' Lucian was casted and played superbly. The twists with his story and character are what really made this movie much more than your cliched horror film. The fact that this movie had an intricate history and actual plot behind its characters made you side with its actors that much more. I loved Lucian at the start when he was a 'bad guy' and i loved him even more at the end when he became a 'tragic hero' in his own little way. And the ending, with its slow silent face to face shot and fitting background music, really hit the mark. There were so many words spoken and emotions put out in that awesome wordless exchange.<br /><br />From its great plot that was ever surprising, to its beautiful settings, scenary, and gothic environments, and to the vicious, growling, and awesome looking werewolves, this was a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />Underworld did not become a sleeper success and best selling dvd for no reason. So if you want your horror movies with a bit more to them than killings and gore than pick up Underworld. You wont be disappointed.
B000002H6C|4.0|If it weren't for the somewhat screwed-up sound production, I would've given this otherwise excellent album 5 stars. The lyrics and everything else (besides the base) sounds awesome. I just wished that the producer didn't go and add his \\"final touches\\" to go and screw up Jason Newsted's otherwise excellent base playing. I still recommend this one, though.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|It's just so hard to one-up an album like Transatlanticism.  They didn't.  But what Death Cab DID do is write a good set of songs and put them together.  Except for the songs that suck.. they put those in there too which tends to make an album less non-sucking.  Yes, part of me is disappointed with this.. And my disappointment goes a long mile in this our music industry.  Do I have clout you ask? Yes I do thank you very much, my buddies and I have a kick ass band.. I mean, we don't really have any gigs or anything but we jam every Wednesday and Saturday night at my neighbor's place and consider ourselves pretty much the bibbity bomb diggity with a capital cool.  Plus tons of chicks always show up and we all get laid and that's really why anyone would ever want to play music anyway.      Um anyway I just feel like there's fill in here.  With Transatlanticism, each track had these huge teeth that would dig into you, each from a slightly different angle, and just rip you up in that way that great music can.  Some albums just do that. This album has tracks that really hit you in the gut, but there's not that continuity and excitement with Plans.. With Trans, I was sad when each song ended, and then immediately happy because the next song was great.  Ok, I can be an emotional train-wreck sometimes, I admit it.. but that's only when I haven't slept with a girl in like 6-7 hours (which is a real rarity).     There are several songs that are what I call \\"one hook wonders;\\" whether it's a catchy chorus or a melodius riff, which are great in and of themselves, it's just not enough to make the song great.  Hey whatever happened to the Oneders anyway? They were great until they SOLD OUT to the man and changed their names to the stupid \\"Wonders.\\"  Jebus, I just want my \\"Oh-knee-ders\\" back, is that too much to ask this crazy mixed-up world?  But back to the really important things I have to say about \\"one hook wonders\\" (don't you wish you were witty enough to come up with something like that?) Songs of this ilk are \\"Summer Skin,\\" \\"Different Names for the Same Thing,\\" \\"Someday you Will be Loved,\\" and a couple others that I pretty much skip over.  It's unfortunate that \\"When Soul Meets Body\\" is the first single, I think this song lacks the depth, both lyrical and instrumental, that really makes DCFC such an indie pop 'powerhouse' (or firehouse).  I think Death Cab could really benefit from studying the sound of Firehouse, the pop hair rock band from the 80's, I mean, it really doesn't get much better than \\"Love of a Lifetime.\\"  Anyway, \\"When Soul Meets Body\\" is still a good song, but not great.  I think what saved a couple of Transatlanticism songs such as \\"Lightness\\" and \\"Expo '86\\" from that 'one hook wonder' category was Chris Walla's layered and melodic arpeggiated guitar work.. something that's lacking on Plans.  I just can't listen to this album all the way through.  I tried to once and it wasn't pretty, I ended up throwing this hot chick out the passenger door of my moving car because I got about 30 seconds into \\"Someday you Will be Loved\\" and I got so mad that I lost my big stiff one. See it takes like 90% of my blood to fill that monster anyway, so when I get mad I need some of that blood to fuel my rage. What can you do?  I mean, God delivered it, I signed for it, world keeps on spinnin'.        Sigh, ok the hard part's over with, now for the good news.  What made me rush to the local store here and buy this baby was \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed.\\"  The intro with its simple but striking piano (is it me or can DCFC record a piano better than anyone pretty much ever?) sucks you in, and then hits you when the drums kick in.  A lot of depth and (non-over)production on that track.  That was the first track I put on when I ripped the cd out of the case and crammed it in my cd player.  I almost hit a pedestrian while I was looking down.. flippin' idiot should watch where he's going.  See the sacrifices I make for you Death Cab? Anyway I hit 'back' twice and listened to \\"What Sarah Said.\\"  Quite possibly one of the best DCFC songs I've ever heard, it's one of those gut-punch kind of songs that just puts you catatonic.  And who could forget \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark,\\" which sounds stripped down and brilliantly acoustic, and reminds me a good deal of The Shins.  Which is a very good thing.    Anyway, if it's the long and the short you want..  Is it better than Trans? No.  Should you hit pedestrians and throw girls out of moving vehicles for this album?  No, that's just how I roll.  Should you buy this album? Yes.        -Rudy
B000002H97|4.0|Say what you will; I still enjoyed this one. Sure, I still have some mixed feelings about the direction Metallica took with this album and the direction that they COULD'VE taken, but hey, nothing perfect ever lasts.    Enter Sandman - 5 stars  Sad But True - 5 stars  Holier Than Thou - 4.5 stars  The Unforgiven - 4 stars  Wherever I May Roam - 4 stars  Don't Tread On Me - 2 stars  Through The Never - 4 stars  Nothing Else Matters - 4.5 stars  Of Wolf And Man - 3 stars  The God That Failed - 4 stars  My Friend Of Misery - 5 stars  The Struggle Within - 5 stars    Overall, I recommend this one. Not as highly as their previous stuff, but it's still worth a purchase for metal fans and rock fans alike.
B000003T9B|5.0|i've been wrecking my neck to over kill for i guess about 17 years now & had never heard their debut. i finaly picked it up back in march of this year & damn is it good! its my new favorite over kill.i can't say its technicaly the best of their catalog .i do think its the most entertaining. the original lineup fresh from the underground,loaded w/great songs & its remastered.a MUST for over kill freaks or headbangers for that matter.
B00005MAM2|5.0|There are so many great things in the movie but now I am only going to list one of the many great things in this movie.  THE BACKGROUND  !!!!!!!!!!!  It was so well illustrated.  You can also select a mode wich allows you to view the Japanese.
B0006FO8RA|4.0|all of her best songs in one album! This is a good album if you want her greatest songs. I'm not really a fan of britney spears but i pretty much like every song on here except for a few i dont really listen to. I'm a slave 4 u, baby one more time, and do something are a few of the best on this album
B0007GAEGC|4.0|I love this cd! I was a little disappointed to find one title I wanted not on it, but that was my fault.
B0000084J7|5.0|A must have record...absolute masterpiece for all kind of music fans. Yes, you could label this as minimalist, but put on your headphones before going to sleep and enjoy the genius of Mark Hollis...whispering voices...the essence of contemporary music...
B00062IVKS|5.0|Cro-magnon man in the guise of a boxer. This is an incredible slice-of-life bio-pic of boxer Jake LaMotta, one-time middleweight champ whose biggest fight was always against himself. Robert DeNiro plays LaMotta, and it's as riveting and brilliant as the young Brando was. LaMotta is portrayed as a sleazeball who pounds his ring opponents to a pulp and mistreats everyone else he meets, too. His worst behavior is toward his wife, whom he distrusts for no reason at all. The only good thing about him is that he won't work for the mob and he won't take a dive. The movie is brutal, everyone and everything is treated like a piece of garbage, but director Scorese and DeNiro's performance bring a near-poetic quality to it. The b&w photography is also superb. DeNiro won the Oscar for best actor; if he didn't after this performance, the award would be a [...]. Definitely worth a watch.
B000AL730O|5.0|i will start this review by saying i saw the beatles at shea stadium in new york in 1965..i was 15 then....the beatles music became the soundtrack to my life.....i do own all the solo things as well....i was very excited by the hype this macca lp was getting,but hearing is believing......i now have heard and i can honestly say this lp is his best....is it because im 55 and dont want to hear a rock album??...no......these songs are simply the best batch of tunes paul has ever created as a solo artist..his voice is hearfelt almost sorrowful...the songs are gentle yet cutting...the melancholy is spread thru out this lp...\\"jenny wren\\" with its poignant lyrics about a world gone wrong will gain strength as the years pass....\\"a certain softness\\"is sheer romance by a gentle man...the pounding piano on \\"fine line\\" is right on the edge...\\"english tea\\" is jaunty and very british..paul's pick of nigel goodrich of radiohead fame as his producer was just what paul needed....hey lets remember ok computer was not that loud of an album either but it had strange twists and turns....so does chaos and creation....paul mccartney has always been the master of melody, and here you are hearing a man of 63 at the top of his game....just try to visualize yourself in his shoes and what he has seen and what he has accomplished in his life...then sit back and play this album from start to finish and enjoy every note of this lovely music...and as john once said....we are all dreamers......and paul, you are keeping our dream alive....thank you!!!
B000ASATWQ|5.0|This disc lives in my cd player. Not a bad song on the disc. Very well produced album.
0553208845|4.0|The book I recieved was fairly worn, moreso than the description suggested, but it met my needs
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|I love soundtracks and this is the first time I enjoyed an American TV series soundtrack. Watching BSG I began to notice the music and how it really enhanced what was happening on screen. This soundtrack is impressive and distinctive.  Wander my Friends, Kobal Last Gleaming, and A Good Lighter are my favorites.  <br /> <br />Most tv series I barely notice the music, this soundtrack brought tears to my eyes.
B000002WYT|5.0|Incredible.  This is my favorite Dave Matthews Band album.  From the first track to the last, the diversity and variety of the music is incredible.  The only way to review this album is to go track by track: <br /> <br />1) So Much to Say -- (9.1/10)  This is a fun song that captures the quirkiness of their music and lyrics.  Rythmic acoustic guitar and flexible vocals make this song an excellent song for beginniners to begin with, and a great song for lifelong fans to sing/dance along to. <br /> <br />2) Two Step -- (9.3/10)  Quiet, rythmic acoustic guitar begin the song, but it almost immediately begins to swirl into a swinging, jovial tune.  Lyrics are top-notch, and the rest of the band (not just Dave) all get a time to shine here in this song. <br /> <br />3) Crash Into Me -- (10/10)  This song gets a lot of recognition, and is there any wonder why?  Everything about the song is incredible.  The band meshes together behind Dave, giving Dave the spotlight, but keeping the support behind him.  This song is next to impossible to play on guitar, and Dave pulls it off magnificiently.  The lyrics are some of Dave's best.  The rythym that Carter Beauford provides on the snare drums is insanely good.  You cannot help but tap your foot to the (almost) marching beat. <br /> <br />4) Too Much -- (8.7/10)  This is my least favorite song on the album (but remember, all of this IS my personal preference).  This is a very fun song that has amazing potential live.  Electric guitar bends and crazy, crazy lyrics make this song a fun dance song. <br /> <br />5) Say Goodbye -- (9.8/10)  One of Dave's greatest songs, hands down.  This song is simply all about sex, and it is absolutely beautiful.  Leroi Moore (usually the saxophonist) plays the flute on this song, and the atmosphere created is absolutely amazing.  Dave's voice soars effortlessly through the most difficult parts, leaving the listener stunned.  This is a great song to get into the mood with. <br /> <br />6) #41 -- (9.5/10)  This song... again... is about sex.  It is just as beautiful as 'Say Goodbye,' and it utilizes the saxophone and violin more.  With a jam part at the end of it, this makes a great song to not only get into the mood with, but too... actually... you get the picture.  The jam part at the end of it makes for amazing potential live, which the band follows through with often.  If you want a great 10 minute version, download it off the \\"Listener Supported\\" live album.  Or just buy it, it's completely worth it. <br /> <br />7) Drive in, Drive Out -- (9.0/10)  Like 'Too Much,' this song is a quirky, upbeat, bendy song.  Dave plays the electric guitar on this one also.  The ending jam part simply blows the mind, leaving you with a 'wow' feeling at the end.  The lyrics are again strange, but fitting for the song itself.  Stefan Lessard's bass guitar gets a workout during this song, as well as Boyd Tinsley's violin.  And as usual, on every track, Carter Beauford, the drummer, is excellent with percussion -- cowbell, etc.. <br /> <br />8) Let You Down -- (9.0/10)  This is my favorite DMB song to listen to when I want to relax.  The acoustic guitar, the light bongos, the tinkling percussion, and Dave Matthew's voice all swirl together brilliantly to bring about one of my favorite relaxation songs of all time.  The lyrics beg for forgiveness, and the mood is very mellow.  A great contrast to 'Drive in, Drive Out.' <br /> <br />9) Lie in Our Graves -- (8.7/10)  This is the ultimate jam song.  The song's upbeat rythym slows down to a very sensual, rythmic jam session at the end.  A very enjoyable song, although I tend to skip it.  But I don't know why I do that because what I start to listen to it, I can't stop -- I get into it and I can't get out of it.  It brings you into another world. <br /> <br />10) Cry Freedom -- (10/10)  The lyrics will blow your mind.  They are hard to understand because in this song, Dave tends to mumble.  But if you look online at [...] , you'll find the lyrics for all of the songs.  Just click on the red box next to the songs you see there.  Dave plays electric guitar on this one as well, to great effect.  The song is quiet, for the most part, as the lyrics are the main focus (over everything else).  The song begs for understanding and equality among humans, declaring \\"Hands and feet are all alike, but gold between divide us,\\" and that \\"The future is no place to place your better days.\\" <br /> <br />11) Tripping Billies -- (10/10)  Tied with 'Cry Freedom,' 'Tripping Billies' is my favorite song on the album.  The lyrics are absolutely incredible, bringing us back to our childhood, and sending us messages such as \\"Eat, drink, and be merry -- for tomorrow we'll die.\\"  The song begs us to live life today, live life as if we were to die tomorrow.  The song is about love, friendship, and having a great time.  Listen to the lyrics -- they are the focus.  But towards the end of the song, Boyd Tinsley's violin takes center stage.  Incredible violin solos round out the song perfectly.  I saw this song live last year in Phoenix and it absolutely blew my socks off.  Do not pass this song up.  Even if you don't buy the album, download the song. <br /> <br />12) Produest Monkey -- (9.4/10)  Easily the quirkiest song on the CD, 'Produest Monkey' is about a monkey who leaves the jungle and goes to the city and experiences things monkeys ordinarily wouldn't experience.  This is a great song to take a walk to, or to just chill out to.  The song gradually rises in pace and volume, and at the end is capped off perfectly by an excellent saxophone solo by the insanely talented Leroi Moore.  The song is a perfect end to the album.  The song is nine minutes long and makes for an excellent song live (although it is rarely played live). <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, the album is one that should not be missed.  It is one of those albums that you begin to listen to track one, and you cannot help but go all the way to track 12 without stopping.  An hour of music goes by in a few minutes, it seems.  Enjoy it, for it is one of the most enjoyable albums out there.  If you throw down preconcieved notions about the Dave Matthews Band and go into this album with an open mind, you will enjoy it.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|At first listen, I thought Plans was a bit dull compared to the rest of DCfC's material. There is definitely something lacking in this album. As people have mentioned before, most of the songs are ballads that more or less sound the same. Of course, 'Soul Meets Body' comes to mind first as one of the better songs on Plans. Others like 'I Will Follow You into the Dark,' 'What Sarah Said', and even 'Brothers on a Hotel Bed' are up there also. However, the other songs act as fillers to the album; I often find myself skipping ahead to the songs I mentioned above. If you are new to Death Cab for Cutie, I urge you to go out and buy Transatlanticism and The Photo Album before buying Plans. Those two albums are equally amazing, and Plans just doesn't do this incredible band much justice.
B000641ZA4|5.0|The very first thing that you should be amazed at is the extraordinary sound that this DVD has for its mixes in DTS and Dolby 5.1. The instruments are well balanced all around the main 5 channels (front right and left, center and sorrounds) to create a full surround feel, that makes the songs sound heavier and clearer, due mostly to the new remixes by Nick Davis, that guarantee that you will hear the songs differently anyway.      Mainly, it's the voice the most favored by the 5.1 sound, since is heard in the center, almost alone, therefore, clearer than ever.    The full sound is better appreciated here, in DTS and dolby 5.1, than in stereo, as heard in the CD version of this collection that was simultaneously released, in which most of the songs are remixed, no doubt taking advantage of the work that was done for the dvd release. The sound that in some instances is \\"overloaded\\" in the CD, is better heard in the multi-channel DVD.    My only complaint would be the mixing of \\"No son of mine\\". For any strange reason, Nick Davies choose to lower the drum sound once the chorus of the song begins, making it loose strenght. So it's only in some parts of this song that you can really hear it heavier than usual. But the rest of the DVD is like discovering the songs all over again.    The sound alone is reason enough to acquire this collection. The quality of the videos vary from very simple to well produced, according to the time in which they were released, with the exception of \\"Robbery Assault & Battery\\" and \\"Trick of the tale\\". Being both from 1976, they were ahead of their time. Even \\"Ripples\\", also from 1976, without special effects or acted parts, has very interesting camera combinations and impressive use of lights.    Practically, you have 2 dvds for the price of one, due to the amount of material included, more than 2 and a half hours, which would have promted others to release it in two chapters. Now, the fact that they choose to include all the material in onedisc has affected the sharpness of the videos. We can guess that the quality would have been better if the videos were not so compressed. But for me, this is a minor flaw.    This collection contains ALL the Genesis video promos of the Phil Collins era, plus the last 3 from \\"Calling all stations\\" with Ray Wilson (including one of best songs/videos of this collection, \\"Not about us\\") and \\"Carpet Crawlers\\", the \\"re-recorded\\" version of this song that was released in 1999 and the only participation of Peter Gabriel. Of course, there were no real \\"promos\\" in his time, but some footage in concert would have been welcomed. Anyway, we're still waiting for the \\"Genesis in concert\\" video (1973) to be released in DVD. That would only do justice to Peter Gabriel (and also guitarrist Steve Hackett), whose very important role in the group will be unnoticed for the casual or new viewer through this video compilation.    Although all the videos from the earlier VHS collection, Genesis Volumes I & II, are here, there are a couple of differences: \\"Turn it on again\\" is the original promo, not the one from the concert \\"Three sides live\\", and \\"Man on the corner\\" has its original concert sound subtituted by the studio version (hence the lack of sycrho in Phil Collins vocals, most noticeable in the last part of the song. That would be a flaw, except that for me is more interesting to see how one have to wait until almost the end to notice it). Also, Paperlate (through footage from a performance in the BBC) appears here for the first time.
B00005ATQF|3.0|Sad to say but the 1st half was the only part worth looking at. I thought it was very accurate on its portrayal about Parris Island back in the bad old days.
B00064YTMU|5.0|Starting watching on a Sunday morning early, found it to be riveting and stimulating.  Decided to purchase VHS version after it was over.  Missed the beginning and wanted to see the entire movie.  Worth what you pay online for DVD or VHS version, get it.
B000AL730O|4.0|\\"Laugh when your eyes are burning, smile when your heart is filled with pain, sigh as you brush away your sorrow,\\" is the triumphant lyric from one of Paul's most affecting songs \\"Too Much Rain\\" from this excellent new set.  \\"Jenny Wren\\" is a  sweet ballad with a melody that's a cousin to \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" but tinged with the sadness of Pedro Eustache's duduk that gives the track a distinctive sound, \\"When this broken world mends its foolish ways, then we'll spend our days catching up on life.\\"  My favorite track is \\"Promise to You Girl\\" that surprises us with its sudden rock rhythm and the Beatlesque harmony, \\"Every single second of our life we can use to chase the clouds away.\\"  The opener \\"Fine Line\\" that McCartney's also licensed for a Lexus commercial is an excellent track with an addictively catchy McCartney melody, his pounding piano sculpting the piece with its hammering rhythm.  \\"English Tea\\" is another excellent track with a lovely string opening and its whimsical lighthearted melody.  \\"Chaos & Creation In the Backyard\\" extends McCartney's legacy as one of the most important of our modern songwriters and one of our planet's creative treasures.  Enjoy!
B00005MP58|3.0|This DVD set's color is poor.  The VHS version color is much, much better. The series is wonderful, of course. <br />
B00005RG6B|5.0|One of the best music DVDs I've seen.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Rap and Heavy Metal, everybody said it wouldn't mix. But it did and this album isn't the best example of Rap/Metal. Limp Bizket are what kids call \\"Posers\\", Thinkin' that their cool even though their lyrics are cheap, Immature, and completly stupid. i can remeber when i was like 8 or 9 i thought the song \\"Rollin\\" was the coolest song ever. Now that i'm older and i am into more music i know a good song when i hear one and \\"Rollin\\",\\"My Way\\", \\"My Generation\\" don't fit the cut. Also if you listen the same riff is used one more than 1 song. (Which isn't wrong at least if the song is different.) Bands like Anthrax and Rage Against the Machine (Now i see why that guy jumped on stage at the VMA's for they rightfully won the award unlike these guys) would be ashmed to hear where their legacys have ended up. Anthrax were the first to do rap/metal, Rage Against the Machine perfected it, and Limp Bizket destroyed it.
B000059MEK|5.0|I picked up this CD by chance more than anything else while I was looking around the back of my local record store. What a find it was! This is amazingly fresh music some types of which I have never been exposed to before. The daring beats and weird vocals are just some of the dazzling features of this album.<br /><br />Daft Punk keep out of the public limelight by wearing robot masks during interviews and this was the first I had heard about them. The whole album suggests nothing of mysteriousness as the flaunt their dance-hall grooves. The album on the whole is really enjoyable and some of the songs are classic.
0743238257|5.0|Very pleased with the service. Book was in better shape than I expected,since I purchased used.Excellent experience.  Thank you!!!
B000002UAU|5.0|Yes, the \\"Paul is dead\\" hoax really kept folks going finding all the little clues on the artwork and hints in the album's songs. Billy Shears sounded much like Paul :) and the hints of a car crash due to Lovely Rita taking the driver's attention away from the road. The scar on Billy's lip hints that the pic is not Paul, but a dude found in Canada, William (Billy) Shears. Many of the albums like Abby Road had hints of the same joke. The lads were brilliant in the joke played on the world. I don't think I ever heard of any of them admitting to it, but being the fun loving chaps that they are, they, like magicians, will never tell. Five plus stars.  <br />By the way. To the fella up top some, Paul played bass and George was lead guitar. One of the best ever.
B0009W5JS2|1.0|...Ice Cube should have stayed where he was, pumping out his already lousy rap/hip-hop. What were the producers thinking that a rap artist could pull off a James Bond type? Don't even waste your time with this one.
B0000931QA|5.0|We're not talking about just any album here. We're talking about Queensryche's 'tour de force', their 'magnum opus' or any other cliche that denotes sheer perfection. Yes we're talking about Operation: Mindcrime, not only Queensryche's zenith, considered by many as the apogee of concept albums and heavy metal in general. Basically we're talking about progressive metal nirvana.<br /><br />There is a reason that the preponderance of reviewers give Operation: Mindcrime five stars. When it comes to concept albums, it is the standard to which all concept albums are compared, it has no peers. Heck I do it myself, stacking other very good concept albums against the incomparable Operation: Mindcrime.<br /><br />What is a concept album? It is simply an album where each song revolves around a single concept or story.<br /><br />In only their second album, Queensryche scored their breakthrough success with this most ambitious concept album, Operation: Mindcrime, which tells the story of an anarchist whose disillusionment with Reagan-era American society leads him to join a shadowy plot to assassinate corrupt leaders. The band plays fabulously and Geoff Tate does both a great acting and singing job and the music as indicated is quite ambitious, featuring, among others \\"Suite Sister Mary\\", a ten-minute track with orchestrations by Michael Kamen.<br /><br />The band released two hit singles \\"Eyes of a Stranger\\" and \\"I Don't Believe In Love\\" from this album which is basically hard driving heavy metal except for these singles, which are both power ballads. Interspersed within the music are four suites of dialogue and several other cameos of short monologue or dialogue which help tell the story. These certainly add a nice touch in completing this great recording.<br /><br />Da Story<br /><br />Operation Mindcrime begins in a hospital ward where a patient named Nikki after a pain shot from a nurse who calls him a bastard, recalls the recent rash of murders he perpetrated at the request of Dr. X. Nikki, you see, was a psychotic, cynical malcontent who was recruited and brainwashed by the nefarious Dr. X, a power crazed evangelical preacher, leader of 'The Order', to be his personal assassin.<br /><br />After getting Nikki addicted to drugs, brainwashed and dependent on him for his fixes, Dr. X sends Nikki first out to kill an unnamed corrupt politician, then his girlfriend Mary (an ex hooker) and the priest who got her off the streets because they are risks.<br /><br />After completing his mission but not remembering it, he finds Mary murdered and realizing what he has done, Nikki goes on a drug binge and ends up in the hospital, the victim of a self induced narcotics overdose. From there the songs vacillate to a series of recriminations and rationalizations with \\"Breaking the Silence\\" \\"I don't Believe in Love\\" and \\"The Eyes of a Stranger\\".<br /><br />My Favorites<br /><br />It is truly a hard choice on this album but here is my list of the four best songs:<br /><br />\\"Spreading the Disease\\"<br /><br />For those faint of heart you may want to stay away from this song as it's just loaded with sex and deviancy. It is the sordid tale of Mary a prostitute, whom Nikki tries to save by getting a priest to take her off the streets. This emotive song is set to heavy double base drums at a medium/fast tempo with plenty of metal accompaniment.<br /><br />\\"Suite Sister Mary\\"<br /><br />A ten minute and forty second masterpiece, this 'piece de resistance' starts out with Dr. X ordering Nikki to go out and kill Mary and the priest after which, \\"Mary\\" starts out with a solo melodic guitar and a Choir which goes on to accompany Tate throughout the song. As on the whole album there are sound effects and dialogue thrown in such as thunder and sirens.<br /><br />The music itself is again a highly emotional but variable paced number that is a wonderful confluence of rock/metal and opera.<br /><br />\\"I don't Believe in Love\\"<br /><br />In this song Nikki denies hislove for Mary because he cannot face the fact that he murdered her. It is a sad melancholy power ballad. It is very melodic with a varied pace, the verses being slower than the chorus. This was released as a single because it is quite accessible and it was a minor hit even though taken away from the story it loses something.<br /><br />\\"The Eyes of a Stranger\\"<br /><br />This is my favorite song after \\"Mary\\", it is again very melodic varied tempo piece with a great guitar intro. Tate does some powerful singing here on the choruses. the song picks up speed as it goes on up to about a medium pace.<br /><br />Another single and again a minor hit.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />I have a confession to make. I don't put much emphasis on lyrics and seldom pay much attention to them, especially when they are hard to understand. Operation: Mindcrime is the exception. The lyrics are easily understood and tell a sad if not exciting, suspenseful story. I'm sure everyone will have their own interpretation of this monumental work, in my case I visualized definite similarities to the movie Manchurian Candidate.<br /><br />In this day of terrorism and runaway fanatical religion this classic album/story gains even more importance.<br /><br />There are so many nuances in the epic CD that everytime I listen to it I pick up something new. If you haven't heard Operation: Mindcrime, don't you think it's time.this song Nikki denies his love for Mary because he cannot face the fact that he murdered her.

0140120416|5.0|I have found the other reviews of this book to be so useful that I have only a brief comment to add.  I used the old edition book in grad school in order to learn to read Russian.  I could not believe how much progress I was able to make in less than two semesters.  By the end of the book, I was able to work through some chapters in books on Soviet history with the help of a dictionay and a verb guide.  I felt very indebted to Penguin, especially since languages come slowly for me.    But I must stress what previous reviewers have said:  You will need to supplement this book with a CD/tape set, unless you are working with a tutor who speaks Russian, or are interested ONLY in reading.  When I later went on to audit Russian classes at my university, I discovered that my pronunciation was WAY OFF.  The older edition (I can't speak for the new one) doesn't address big questions like vowel-reduction in unstressed syllables; voiced- and voiceless-consonant pairs; \\"-ogo\\" as \\"-ovo\\"; and so on.   It was tough to have to unlearn my bad habits.    With that said, I can't imagine a clearer, more concise, more user-friendly introduction; it was much better than the first year college text that my courses used.  And $60 cheaper!  If you use this together with, say, \\"Instant Immersion-Russian,\\" you can learn a lot of Russian on your own.      A final note from my experience, for what it's worth:  The trend these days is to teach languages by conversation, with as little old-fashioned grammar work and repetivie drill as possible.  And I'll grant to my professors that I have been able to learn a good amount of French this way.  But Russian is a language that really rewards the learner who studies the grammar.  And I have found the \\"boring ole repetitive drill\\" method to be essential when I try to work on speaking.  Russian is so heavily inflected that I can't think through adjective and noun endings while speaking.  I simply HAVE TO practice sample sentences over, and over, and over, until I have the forms down, and can substitue the words I want to use.    I speak only modest--perhaps \\"Intermediate\\"--Russian.  So don't take any of the above as Gospel.  But I've found learning Russian to be so much fun.  I hope you do, too.  Good Luck!
B00015HVI8|5.0|Enjoyed this series.  Subtle humor is a lot of fun as well as the adventure story.
B00008973Q|4.0|I do not disagree with others who comment on the DVD transfer. There were other oddities, too, like having both English dubbing and subtitles, with no menu for turning either off, and havin to endure the fact that the spoken and written words said different things. That's just the container, though.<br /><br />The content is a stunning achievement. At 2.5 hours, it can be a bit much, but Kurosawa's artistry makes it worthwhile. By the way, disregard those reviewers who liken it to King Lear. It starts out in a similar way, and people who watched only the first half would miss the complexities of the later plot. This movie is about revenge, the kind that waits between generations for completion. The mechanism is in place from somewhere near the start, but fulfilled only at the end.<br /><br />I can not think of an equal to this visual spectacle. If this were redrawn, not as a movie but as a sequence of still shots, it would retain almost all of its impact. Framing and composition are everything, motion within the image is often missing, minor, or irrelevant. Although he was a master of B&W, Kurosawa used color with striking, iconic effect in this movie. He also seemed to reach back to older traditions of Japanese theater - Hidetora and Kaede, especially, had stage makeup more like Noh masks than like living man and woman.<br /><br />It's a great story, carried by wonderful and very non-Western storytelling. I just wish the presentation was better.<br /><br />//wiredweird

B0007CNXUK|4.0|FINDING NEVERLAND starring the actor Johnny Depp is a winner.  Depp has demonstrated over and over he is a multitalented actor who is best adapted to playing eccentric and/or magical men whether they sail pirate ships, delve in chocolate, or sculpt ice.  In this film the svelte Depp depicts the robust JM Barrie, author of Peter Pan and creator of Neverland.  Kate Winslett is counterpart, looks wonderful wearing the fashions from the early 20th century-large hats and big skirts- whether she plays an American heiress, an impoverished widow or an Oxford scholar. And, she can act, so her characters are poignant and believable, and the interaction is real.  Julie Christie as Winslett's mother is as beautiful as ever, while appearing maternal and stern. Dustin Hoffman is a wonderful foil to Depp as he plays the somewhat rational producer of his magical play. The little boys who play Winslett's sons and who along with their mother inspire the work are absolutely swell.<br /><br />My sister warned me that the book and film were tear-jerkers, and the film is at least a three-hankie affair. It is also a beautiful magical film and I found myself saying \\"I believe in fairies\\" more than once, but particularly when Tinkerbell drinks the poisoned medicine to save Peter. The message, \\"What your mind can conceive and believe it will achieve\\" is stressed, although all the characters discover that denying something won't make it go away.<br /><br />These days, I \\"screen\\" everything before I buy it, so I watched the rented version of the film, however, I like this DVD enough to buy it.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I have to confess - I am a newbie to the genre of Dracula and Frankenstein. Too young to have watched the black-and white originals, and too prone to nightmares to watch the serious modern remakes. However, this is what made Van Helsing excellent entertainment for me; It was never my intention to proclaim snootily at the end, \\" It was alright, but not as good as the first one.\\" I watched it without over-scrutininzing it, and appreciated its wild thrills and comic undertones.    The bones of the[...]are pretty formulaic. You have your dark, brooding hero of mysterious origins, luscious heroine with come-hither kick-ass abilities, and the insane comic sidekick who nearly threatens to steal the show. Dracula is (surprise!) hatching a nefarious plot and only Van Helsing can stop him. Yawn.    This where the madcap action sets in. There is rarely a moment in which something is not going bang or crash, and the CGI is set amid stunning visual direction. All the adrenaline action is in severe danger of going over the top (as it did in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) but it is salvaged by two things. Firstly, the aforementioned visual splendour of destruction, enhanced by the riotous premise of the whole movie. Secondly, the acting is good enough to prevent the characters from becoming mere dummies thrown around by explosions.    Hugh Jackson is typical Indiana Jones. Enough said. Beckinsale has a very seductive accent and is generally passable. Count Dracula is a marvellous, tongue-in-cheek ham, who earns instant dislike. The cream of the crop is David Wenham (Faramir from LOTR), as a foul-mouthed, womanizing priest-mad scientist in an impossibly British accent. His dry wit, interspersed by cringing and whimpering, ala a fish out of water, are perfect comic uplifters when the story starts to sag.    Topped off by every evil monster in the book, and an array of weapons (a machine arrow-gun, I tell you) with scant regard to historical accuracy, Van Helsing is a visual spectacle, promising few scares but thrill-a-minute entertainment
B000AL730O|1.0|Plagiarism, awful lyrics, and bad production and recycled tunes mark this out to be an album of little worth, no matter what people say.  McCartney's albums are always praised then forgotten about a year later.  Let me give you a sample of the genius lyrics on this album: <br /> <br />Now I see, this is the way it's supposed to be <br />I met you and now I see <br />This is the way it should be <br /> <br />This is the way it should be, for lovers <br />They shouldn't go it alone <br />It's not so good when your on your own <br /> <br />So come to me, now we can be what we want to be <br />I love you and now I see <br />This is the way it should be <br />This is the way it should be <br /> <br />In other words- pure schlock.  That goes for all the songs.  His voice on \\"How Kind of You\\" is like nails down a chalkboard.  Boring production permeates \\"At the Mercy\\" and \\"A Certain Softness\\"- two horrible songs.  The melody of \\"People get Ready\\" is lifted and put in \\"Anyway,\\" which is not very good even with that.  \\"English Tea\\" is a rewritten version of \\"For No One\\" and \\"Jenny Wren\\" is a rewritten \\"Blackbird\\" and several other songs. <br /> <br />I liked \\"Flaming Pie\\"- it had some energy to it with \\"Beautiful Night\\" and a truly classic song, \\"Calico Skies.\\"  But this- this is embarrassing.  It's not worth buying- please preview it first before you throw money out of the window with this.
0340818867|5.0|Kate Fox observes and analyzes the English. She comes up with a list of characteristics which describe their behavior. The first and primary one is social dis-ease. By this she means 'all our chronic inhibitions and handicaps.\\" It is discomfort and awkwardness in the whole realm of social interaction. \\"Embarassment, insularity, awkwardness, perverse obliqueness, emotional constipation, fear of intimacy and general inability to engage in a normal and straightforward fashion with other human beings.\\"<br /><br />She sees the famous English ' reserve' and its opposite 'English hooliganism' as signs of the same basic disorder.<br /><br />To this dis- ease she says the English reflexively respond. The first response is with Humor. English understated and ironic often self- deprecatory humor is the great reflexive action to awkwardness. The English play it and themselves down.<br /><br />Another reflexive action is ' moderation' or ' the avoidance of extremes of any kind'.\\" Our moderate industriousness and moderate hedonism\\" and \\"our ambivelence,apathy, woolliness, middlingness, fenc- sitting etc.\\"She says the English do everything in moderation except being moderate.<br /><br />A third reflex is 'hypocrisy'But she sees this not as a negative but as expression of the English desire to be fair, and not insulting. And she shows how English speech is filled with phrases 'sorrys ' of various kinds which aim at not intruding and hurting.<br /><br />Other basic English characteristics are what she calls ' empiricism' that is a preference for the concrete, the sensually realistic , rather than for wooly theorizing. And along with this there is the English 'eeyorness' by which she means ineffectual complaining, 'moaning' non- stop in a not - very serious way. This relates too to a typical English pessimism, or skepticism. She also speaks about how strongly class- conscious the English are in their speech and manner. And how for them the values of fair play, courtesy and modesty are central.<br /><br />I must admit that her analysis taught me quite a bit about the English. I recently had to spend a month in England in not very pleasant circumstances in a hospital. I found the great share of the people there extremely polite and considerate. I was however a bit puzzled by their capacity at preserving a distance, and their clear avoidance of any kinds of strong emotional expression. For instance I wanted to thank one nurse who had been especially kind to my wife and myself. But I saw that any 'emotional thanks' was out of place, and that she took the manner in a much lighter way.<br /><br />Again I learned by this book , but it is not seem to me the whole story.<br /><br />One of the things which most strikes me about the English does not necessarily have to do with their way of acting in everyday life situations now. Shakespeare is English and so is Wordsworth, and so is Newton and Faraday and Darwin. And the list of very great English is very long indeed. And in my own field of Literature certainly the English have created one of the great literatures of mankind.<br /><br />So my question is not simply how the English manage in everyday life, and how their character is expressed there. As I see it the English are of Mankind 's ' great peoples' ' great creator peoples'.<br /><br />Now in England I had the feeling that the society as a whole has a very high level of competence, and technical skill. That's one thing, and England's tremendous place in the Scientific and Technological Revolutions of the past five centuries is clear. But how does this relate to the soul of a Wordsworth or a Milton or so many others, the English genius.<br /><br />But perhaps I am unfairly asking that the author have written a book different from the excellent and informative one that she did write.st admit that her analysis taught me quite a bit about the English.

B00008K7AM|4.0|I actually quite liked this movie.  I admit to laughing in one or two or more scenes.  Rob Schnieder is usually so silly you have to laugh and this was no exception.  Of course the movie wouldn't be complete without a cameo by Adam Sandler.  It stars a younger Rachel McAdams, Ashlee Simpson and a host of other familiar looking faces.  Don't watch this if you're waiting to see Oscar winning performances, but if you want to laugh out loud, groan and want to puke all at the same time, then this is for you.
B00008BLB8|5.0|Yes, the earlier live album is a bit more jamming (abd the sound less clear-ugh). <br /> <br />And I'll believe there are still some minor problems. <br /> <br />But I was astonished at how vastly better this sounds: I can heard the skins on the drums flex, for heaven's sake! I can hear the edge to the sound of the guitar! Even the kids saying \\"When I grow up I want to be...\\" are much clearer. I would never have imagined that the original tapes could sound so good and I am THRILLED! <br /> <br />The set itself really rocks. I have to disagree with the reviewer who complains about it so much; I've always enjoyed this album a lot. Yes, it is a mite slicker than the earlier one, but I don't feel it is any kind of rote run-through at all. <br /> <br />BUY IT!
B000A6T262|4.0|Thank you to the reviewer who told me what was contained in this DVD collection.  Nowhere in the Amazon links was that information available.  I wanted all of the Star Trek movies and the friendly 5-star reviewer gave me that information.  I've seen them all and give them four stars in toto.  Some deserve more and others less.  But I keep watching because I'm a Trekie.  AMAZON...get your act together!!!  Your description was way too vague.  If you're offering a \\"DVD Collection,\\" please tell us what it includes and don't rely on reviewers to do it for you.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|You can see many other reviews regarding how kick-ass this album is, so I won't go into all that. <br /> <br />Instead I'll comment briefly about the remastering job itself: <br />- The added tracks are nice to flesh out the amount of content, though they don't dramatically add to the basic experience. <br />- The sound has been improved, though I would say not dramatically to the casual ear. <br />- Mostly your can hear somewhat better definition of the bass, and a bit more crispness overall.
B000AL730O|5.0|I thought we might be getting 12 songs like Fine Line.(Which <br />would not be bad!) Instead we get a  set of songs that <br />require you to listen. If you listen, you hear a great record <br />that should be Paul's Grammy winning Album of the Year. <br />It's so great it's scary.
B000002J2F|4.0|...which is not necessarily a compliment. There is in some way a greater clarity brought to the proceedings, but at the same time a sharpness which you may find unpleasant. The volume level is higher, and a wonder if a little clipping is going on. I will keep this edition, since I am OK with \\"brighter\\" sound, but if you are a fan of a smoother sound (i.e. vinyl records etc) you should buy the non-remastered version.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|On the outside this album seems like something for kids and angst-ridden teenagers but it is so much more than that.  The music is perfection in style, creativity and musicianship.  I was resistant at first but after hearing the album once through I was hooked.  There are a lot of teen appropriate elements to this album but it is still enjoyable to adult metal fans as well.  It is full of riffs that are reminiscent of the metal greats of earlier generations but it is still uniquely theirs and still fresh. Adult metalheads... do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this album and relive your youth... it rocks!
B000001EUR|1.0|I cannot listen to this piece of garbage. It sounds totally clipped, like they only wanted to use the top 2 digital bits or something. Maybe the responsible party didn't realize there are 14 more bits on the CD? Maybe they didn't understand something about the mixing chain? Whatever, it sounds really nasty, and I'm keeping my original copy. <br />Barf!
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|The movie was excellent and the music was spectacular, especially the final song, \\"Remember\\" by Josh Groban.
B000002LEM|3.0|Van Halen's OU812 would not only be the band's second album with Sammy Hagar but would also be their second release to hit #1. While 5150 primarily consisted of hard rockers and power ballads, OU812 shows more eclecticism than their previous releases. The band tries a lot of different styles here and most of them work. This album would also be their only album to spawn four Top 40 singles, something not even 1984 could accomplish.<br /><br />The album's first half is very good beginning with the fast paced rocker \\"Mine All Mine\\", which unlike the poppy songs on 5150, mixes Edward Van Halen's guitar and keyboards equally. Sammy's lyrics are among his best, especially when he's attacking the religious hypocrisy that was in the news in 1988. \\"When It's Love\\" is a great pop song with a memorable hook and catchy chorus and is stronger than the power ballads on 5150. \\"A.F.U. (Naturally Wired)\\" is the best of the hard rock tracks, similar to those on 5150, only with a cleaner production. \\"Cabo Wabo\\" is also very cool with both its lyrics and Edward Van Halen's guitar complementing the track's laid back feel perfectly.<br /><br />The undeniable highlight of the album's second half is the hit single \\"Finish What Ya Started\\" with Sammy's vocals sounding very sensual during the verses while Edward adds some country styled licks to his already impressive repertoire. \\"Black and Blue\\" is also very good featuring a cool riff and the strong and underrated backing vocals of bassist Michael Anthony. The hard rockers \\"Sucker In A 3 Piece\\" and \\"Source of Infection\\", which features great call and response between Sammy and Edward before the guitar solo, are solid but don't quite capture your imagination like their rockers from the David Lee Roth era. Their take on Little Feat's \\"A Apolitical Blues\\" is okay but won't make you forget the original. And this leaves us with the poppy \\"Feels So Good\\", which while continuing the band's diversity, is not one of their finer moments. While not quite as consistent as 5150, OU812 still has several great tracks and is worth checking out.not quite as consistent as 5150, OU812 still has several great tracks and is worth checking out. <br />
B000002MP2|5.0|Green Day seemed to be an overnight sensation. They sprung up out of what seemed to be nowhere in the wake of the alternative rock boom of the early `90s. The success of Nirvana paved the way for many bands to find mainstream success. Green Day consists of three guys from California who just wanted to play music.  The band was in their late teens to early twenties at the time, and was already a popular underground band playing around the world. Their basic formula included loud punk rock chords combined with catchy, melodic hooks, and pop accessibility. The band seemed to single handedly commercialize a genre that mostly remained underground besides bands like The Ramones or The Clash which obviously are influences on the band.     Dookie is the bands first mainstream album. It's more polished than the first few albums the band released independently but it still has a raw feeling. Much of the album deals with many frustrations and insecurities dealing with teenage life. Lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong vents frustration and even sarcasm through the catchy three chord riffs, memorable bass lines of Mike Dirnt, and fantastic drumming of Tre' Cool.  Much of the standout tracks of the album were staples of popular and rock radio that hold up to this day.     The single \\"Longview\\" gave the band their breakthrough hit. It's deep bassline and roaring hook about boredom induced masturbation struck a cord with teenagers around the country. One of the biggest songs of the bands career \\"Basket Case\\" with its truthfulness and catchiness in sheer glory furthered the albums popularity. Many more radio hits came off the album leading to an overwhelming ten million albums sold.  The rest of the album may not be as memorable as the singles but most of it hits just as heavy. Billie Joe let's all his faults, convictions, and emotions show throughout the album on tracks like \\"Coming Clean\\", \\"Pulling Teeth\\", and \\"Burnout\\".  All this in an album by a few \\"snot-nose punks\\"entitled Dookie. Who would have thought of it?     After the success off Dookie, Green Day still continued their career to gain strength. They have gone through artistic growth and maturity but still maintain their spirit that made them popular to begin with. I sadly am a teenager of this generation of popular music but I am glad to have discovered a great band and been able to go back and listen to their progression through each album. Dookie may not be \\"the perfect\\" album and it never tried to be but that's what makes it so enjoyable.

0446677450|5.0|Robert Kiyosaki is probably one of the few published business people who actually know what they are talking about. I say this because most business people would have you believe that getting rich isn't easy, or real estate is a bad investment because tenants could damage your property...which is absurd <br /> <br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad shows the simplicity to acquiring great wealth. To invest in things with predictable earnings (real estate) To get out of liabilities, and to strive to growing your wealth.

0441009425|3.0|This is the 2nd Alastair Reynolds SciFi novel I've read, the first being CHASM CITY.  While REVELATION SPACE was definately better than CHASM CITY, it suffers from same pros and cons:<br /><br />PROS: Interesting and inventive technologies, and an overall decent plot.<br /><br />CONS: Unlikeable characters, long-winded and overly-twisted presentation, and akwardly unbelievable ending.<br /><br />These books are HUGE, this one coming in at 585 paperback pages.  Unfortunately, there are few truly exciting passages, and unlike the equally-long/somewhat-similar but more exciting/likeable Peter F. Hamilton SciFi novels, these books are something of a chore to wade thru.<br /><br />Part of my problem with these books is that they are set more in the far-off future (mid-26th Century) than books I normally like to read... the technology becomes too abstract, and when you throw in a bunch of unlikeable characters and an overly-complicated plot, I keep finding myself wondering why, when there have been so many other books by other authors that I've enjoyed so much more (Peter F. Hamilton, A. Bertram Chandler, Isaac Asimov, Elizabeth Moon, and David Drake for example), or even enjoyed slightly more (Jack McDevitt, Harry Turtledove, Allen Steele), why would I keep going on this series of books when there are so many other books that I would probably like better out there?  At some point, when working your way thru certain book series, you have to say \\"this just isn't working out\\"... this is what happenned to me half-way thru the C.J. Cherryh Atevi Series - I finally said \\"enough is enough\\"... I'm not sure I'm going to go on to the next books in this series (REDEMPTION SPACE and ABSOLUTION GAP) anytime soon (even though I already purchase them, and they are sitting on my bookshelf waiting to be read).
B000AL730O|5.0|Thank you Paul. Thank you for giving many of your long term fans the album that we have been waiting for. Chaos and Creation in the Backyard is a true return to form. <br /> <br />Many of the endearing elements of his music that Beatle, Solo Mac and Wings fans have enjoyed over the years are here in varying degrees. At age 63 his beautiful gift is more subtly nuanced than before and filtered through the eyes of time and experience. <br /> <br />Sure, there are moments on this album that beat you over the head with their references to Paul's musical past. But the nostalgic payoff is sweet. There were moments when I actually had that cool feeling like I was hearing a NEW Beatles song or perhaps pleasant echoes of Ram.    <br /> <br />I think the thing I liked most was the way the songs didn't take the expected paths. Each time I thought I knew what was coming in the sense of formulaic expectations, I was surprised by thoughtful, often minor key turns into interesting and emotionally evocative soundscapes. The kind I have suspected over the years that McCArtney was holding back.  <br /> <br />Riding to Vanity Fair. Incredible. The master of modern melody lives. Just listen. What a powerful experience to be allowed into the darker rooms of this man's psyche, where we have rarely been allowed to enter in recent years. <br /> <br />And, This Never Happened Before shows Mac's touch for romantic balladry is still intact. Painfully pretty, this song deserves more airplay than it will probably receive.  <br /> <br />True. I'm an old Beatle fan. I can see how younger listeners could scoff this album off. Maybe never even listening to it. It doesn't really matter. I know there are many out here in the world who have been given an unexpected gift. A great new album from one of our most beloved musical heros. Thanks again, Paul.   <br /> <br />

B0006399FS|2.0|This album is a continuation of the mediocrity that was All That You Can't Leave Behind and the disaster that was the mainstream listener's reception of Pop. After the Joshua Tree, rather than relying on the same tried-and-true formulas that made them successfull, U2 made an effort to experiment, try something new, and do something different on every album, from Achtung Baby, Zooropa, to Pop. While they succeeded in progressing and producing new sounds with every album, the mainstream public was not prepared to accept U2 as anything other than \\"the classic 80's rock band that did Joshua Tree\\". Pop was written off by most casual listeners as \\"U2 trying to be a techno band\\", spurning U2 to attempt returning back to the \\"classic\\" straight-forward sound that they were famous for. <br /> <br />The result was ATYCLB, which was not horrible, but not revolutionary either. It had some catchy songs, but ultimately everthing sounded somewhat watered down and rehashed. I don't really feel like crucifying the album; I think every mature band is entitled to 1 album where they just try to go back and \\"do what they did best\\", particularly after a long period of experimentation. ATYCLB was still 'ok' as an album, the problem is that this trick doesn't seem to work more than once. <br /> <br />How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb continues this aproach, but I think the well was allready dry before the album started. Again, it's not really horrible, but after listening to it once or twice, the only song which makes me want to put it back in my stereo is A Man And A Woman, which is a pretty good song at this point in U2's career, but certainly not groundbreaking, nor good enough to carry the whole cd. <br /> <br />It seems what isn't mere rehash on this album is simply uninspired or just not very good. I don't think U2 sticks as close to their classic formula as ATYCLB, but it doesn't really invent any new sounds either. If there is any \\"new sound\\" to the album, one which U2 hasn't allreadydone 12 times before better on a previous album, it's the sound of 'Vertigo'. Vertigo seems to be U2's attempt at doing a simple \\"garage rock\\" sound, and it is fairly new, but that's because U2 never had to stoop to that level of simplicity. Even in their early days, they proved from the begining that they had a sound far more original, unique, and sophisticated, but now that they have worn that out, they are just turning the distortion up and screaming \\"yeah!\\" as many times as possible before their 3 minutes is up. <br /> <br />I think it's also worth mentioning, that I agree that Bono's voice is starting to get grating. On a lot of songs on this album, his voice has a very high-pitched, whiny quality that just gets annoying. Bono has never been a stranger to the high registers, particular in U2's 'balad' songs, but with the last 2 albums, I think he has started to go overboard with the emotive wailing, which is certainly contributed to by the rehashed nature of the song writing. Back on Unforgettable Fire, Bono explored 'singing in a disheartened yell' to the point of resembling Robert Smith, but it still sounded much better than the whining present in HTDAAB. <br /> <br />Again, HTDAAB is not horrible, there are some good imitations of classic U2 on here; Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own is catchy, with lot's of Edge guitars, and almost sounds like a classic U2 balad, even if it ends up sounding as much an outtake from ATYCLB. But when I have the entire library of U2 albums before me, there's absolutely nothing in this album that makes me want to choose it to listen to over the others. The few catchy songs on the album generally do not make up for the many uninspired, rehashed ones, and when there is a whole world of original music out there to listen to, who has the time? <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, and rather than buy this album, buy one of U2's older albums you don't own yet, or if you allready have them all, try some other lesser known 80's rockbands, like Echo & the Bunnymen, The Smiths, or something. You'll be far more satisfied listening to original material from a band that isn't necessarily your favorite, than to tired, rehashed material from a band that is your favorite.

0201485672|5.0|Refactoring is something that I was doing subconsiously everyday at my work as a coder. When I got the book I had an \\"aha!!!\\" feeling. Most of the stuff I was doing had labels and names :-) <br />This helped me a lot, since it provided me with the language I needed in order to be able to convey to my colleages what I was doing or what I needed them to do. <br />I think that refactoring as a concept is far more important than design patterns for your everyday work. So far I have only needed design patterns 2 or 3 times, while refactoring I do day in day out.

B000AL730O|4.0|I'm sure there are some who would rate an album of Paul McCartney snoring with 5 stars just as there are others who will always base his latest work on his track record and never give him the benefit of the doubt. I think I fall straight down the middle - I like Paul a lot but I'm easily disappointed by a lot of his work. It's my own belief that you could take all of the albums he's released since his last true classic, Tug of War, and from the six or seven of them pull together three really great albums. His problem is as it has always been - he comes up with some terrific stuff and has no one to tell him that the rest of it isn't up to those impossible standards.  <br /> <br />I wasn't a tremendous fan of Driving Rain - it was pretty good but failed to capitalize on the gains made by Flaming Pie. This album is a much more worthy follow-up. It's great to see that on Chaos and Creation he's minimized his shortcomings. A lot of credit is being given to Nigel Godrich for bringing that missing element to Paul's work but after a couple of listens it's also apparent that the material is also much stronger than what we've become accustomed to.  <br /> <br />I've seen some reviews comparing Paul on this album to Cole Porter and there is the sense that he's really writing songs, not necessarily pop. There's not much in the way of rock and roll here, which is another thing I personally find frustrating with Paul. He can come up with some real kick-ass stuff like his originals on Run Devil Run but leaves them off his other releases.  <br /> <br />Still, with all of that, I've found myself whistling more than a few of the songs on Chaos which is the mark of a good song. I can only think of two tracks that I don't care for and the rest of the album stands up. The question to ask is, if anyone but Paul McCartney put out this album would it be considered first rate and the answer is yes. Give the guy a break - it can't be easy living up to a musical revolution. <br /> <br />Thankyou Paul, you have gone back to your roots. I am a die hard Beatles fan and this cd shows what a great song writer Paul is. I believe Paul and John Lennon were and are the best song writers ever in the era of rock & roll and pop music. Every song on this cd makes you think of someone or something in your own life. Listen to the message in the song \\"To Much Rain\\". The more I play the cd, the more I love it.  <br /> <br /> <br />Fine Line is easily the best song on the CD. It is upbeat and catchy. I liked it immediately. The rest of the CD is taking some time to grow on me. I am a fan of the upbeat McCartney, so the other songs on this CD that stick with me are Friends to Go, English Tea, and Promise To You Girl. Too Much Rain and Jenny Wren are good songs too. The rest of the CD sounds a bit glum, but as several people have said, it grows on you.  <br /> <br />Every time Paul releases a new work, the comparisons to his earlier work are inevitable. Even so, I think all of Paul's work since 1989's Flowers In The Dirt show a similar pattern - some songs very upbeat and catchy, some nice ballads, and some songs that sound like he never quite took the time to finish them.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for Paul to match his efforts with the (very competitive) Beatles or Band on the Run, it's not here. But if you're a McCartney fan, you will find a lot to like on this CD.  <br /> <br />Paul has spent so much time on the road in the last few years, touring and promoting causes, is he getting tired?  <br /> <br />  <br />

0316172324|5.0|Blink is a look at all the various things scientists have discovered about how we think without knowing we're thinking.  It particularly takes a long, hard look at why it is that people's first impressions so often conflict with either what careful analysis says or what people think they believe.    Gladwell looks at a broad range of applications of these ideas.  He looks at why, even though Pepsi wins the blind \\"Pepsi Challenge,\\" Coke continues to be the market leader.  He investigates the psychology and split-second thinking that caused the death of an unarmed, fleeing immigrant from over 40 gunshots fired by NYPD officers.  He looks at various factors that affect everything from standardized test scores to electing a President.    Some have suggested that all Gladwell really tells us is that our first impressions are sometimes right and sometimes wrong.  If after reading this book that's all you come away with, you have completely missed the point.  The point is that whether those impressions are right or wrong is governed by a complex set of physiologic and experiential rules, and that we can do something about them.  Cops can do things to make sure those first impressions don't result in an innocent death.  And yes, you can learn to tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi when you drink a whole can, not just a sip.    Gladwell is a writer for the New Yorker, and his writing style is very much like a bunch of magazine articles.  But they are very GOOD magazine articles, and you want to read them all.
B0002OERI0|1.0|ok everyone knows that billie joe, tre and mike where not the best musicians in the world but they had some good tunes and songs. then, american idiot came out. I thought oh a new green day cd to listen to. so I borrowed the cd from a friend to see if it was any good. What a piece of crap. They gave up there original sound to move on to the popular emo corporate rock sound it sounded like yellowcard (another crappy band). Because of this cd I can't stand any other green day song i hear from now on. If you like sellout popular corporate rock this cd is for you. If you buy or like this cd YOU ARE AN AMERICA IDIOT.

This movie (Persuasion) really erased the wonderful scenes and scenarios that I had created in my mind after reading the book.<br /><br />Amanda Root is so very unconvincing and wrongly cast. While I will not criticize her God given physical appearance, I will say this... she made horribly annoying facial expressions. She also looks oh so much older than 27, she looks pretty much close to 20 years older than that and I am not being mean either. There is absolutely nothing wrong with looking one's age, she just was not suited for such a young part and like wise neither was the actor that played her former suitor (Wentworth).<br /><br />In other words, I am not even writing a review, I am VENTING.... AHHHHH, I felt like screaming as I watched this.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|It's hard to write a review about this album because so much has already been said before.  All I can say is that this rivals just about any other well known debut that changed the face of rock music.  This album rivals such debuts as Zeppelin's first album, Sabbath's-Black Sabbath, and GnR's-Appetite for Destruction just to name a few.  All throughout my life I've heard \\"Running with the Devil\\", and \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\" on the radio, but never realized how solid  their debut was.  There is not one weak track on this album.  In fact some of the songs like \\"Atomic Punk\\" and \\"On Fire\\" are even better than the usual radio staples.  This album rocks hard, fast, and has attitude.  Everything that encompasses hard rock/heavy metal is found right here.    Eddie Van Halen is a guitar master by wailing away louder and faster than anyone before his time.  David Lee Roth was the perfect frontman to showcase his outlandish singing.  Alex Van Halen is a man possessed on drums, and Michael Anthony is an awesome bass player.  Put this combination together and Van Halen's phenomenal debut is born. It's simply amazing!!!  Buy it!!
B0002ZEYYQ|5.0|Anyone who thinks that this album is not the original Jamiroquai sound needs to bust out their Jamiroquai cds and listen again. This album is everything that it claims to be and more. Jamiroquai can do no wrong in my book. I am a die-hard fan and will insist that everyone who has an interest in music listen to them. The whole album is classic Jamiroquai--funky beats, jammin music and great lyrics. Of all the albums Jamiroquai has released this is definately in the top two, with Traveling Without Moving being the best. If you like even one Jamiroquai song, you need to get this album.
B00025ETIW|4.0|To everyone who says this is \\"generic, MTV-branded pop punk,\\" did you listen to it at all?  This music isn't pop punk.  This music isn't emo.  My Chemical Romance may have a goth look but they aren't emo.  Emo is (well, at least what you self-proclaimed music geniuses define emo as) a genre filled with self-pity and thoughts of suicide.  My Chemical Romance's lyrics don't fit this description at all.  Try listening, you'd see that the lyrics sound more like \\"Preach all you want but who's gonna save me? I keep a gun in the book you gave me.  Hallelujiah, lock and load!\\" or \\"Touched by angels, though, I fell out of grace! I've done it all so maybe I'll do this everyday.  Another knife in my hands, a stain that never comes off the sheets, clean me off. I'm so dirty babe!\\"  My Chemical Romance's lyrics center mainly around killing others. <br /> <br />For those of you who say the guitar work isn't above your average mainstream band, listen to Thank You for the Venom.  Are you convinced? If not, check out the guitar solo in \\"You Know What they do to Guys Like us in Prison,\\" the impressively catchy punk/cabaret tune.  If you aren't convinced now, I think the \\"anti-mainstream\\" mindset has brainwashed you more than MTV could ever dream of. <br /> <br />Speaking of MTV brainwashing kids, how can a band be corporate made when they started out on an EXTREMELY indie label?  That's right, do your research.  Try listening to their debut, \\"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\\" on Eyeball Records.  I'd bet my left ear you've never heard of Eyeball Records. <br /> <br />Phew. My Chemical Romance's sophomore effort is an extremely unique take on the punk/metal(infulenced)/goth/emo scene.  If you're willing to try some music with breakneck speed yet a strange, glossy pop sensibility, don't hold back.  Anyone who hates on them hasn't listened to them.  They saw their music video on MTV and thought \\"Oh, deary me.  A band on MTV wearing makeup and singing about death? How undoubtably EMO.\\" <br /> <br />Next thing you know they'll be saying the same thing about Avenged Sevenfold.  Bat Country is getting some MTV airplay now! Oh no, it MUST be pop punk! <br /> <br />1.Helena - 10/10 - An emotional opening.  David Grohl (Foo Fighters) compared it to a queen song <br />2.Give 'Em Hell Kid - 8/10 - The punchy, rapid-fire verses are set back by the lackluster chorus <br />3.To the End - 9/10 - A call/response chorus goes well together with hauntingly sad verses and an impressive solo <br />4.You Know What They do to Guys like us in Prison - 9/10 - A catchy punk/cabaret tune with an impressive solo and politically incorrect subject matter <br />5.I'm Not Okay (I Promise) - 6/10 - The worst song on the record, in my opinion.  A catchy, pop-punk tune that started all the hatred for this band in the first place. <br />6.The Ghost of You - 7/10 - An emotional rock ballad with an amazing video to go along with it <br />7.The Jetset Life is Gonna Kill You - 8/10 - The amazingly powerful distorted guitars in the chorus work wonders in this hard-to-describe song <br />8.Interlude - N/A - Not really a song.  Filler, really. <br />9.Thank You for the Venom - 10/10 - Shows some of their metal influence (guitarist Ray Toro is a big Iron Maiden fan) with metal-esque riffs and an inspiring solo <br />10.Hang 'Em High - 8/10 - A western-themed song, teeters the edge between controlled chaos and insanity <br />11.It's Not a Fashion Statement, it's a Deathwish - 9/10 - A strange blend of many different styles.  Must be heard to be believed. <br />12.Cemetary Drive - 7/10 - Here, the band slips into some seriously emo territory.  Boring compared to the rest of the CD. <br />13.I Never Told You what I do for a Living - 10/10 - A fantastic finisher, it encompasses the style of both albums all in to one dramatic finish.  Amazing.
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul McCartney continues to write songs that are meaningful.  As a musician, he understands that chaos and confusion is a part of the process of creating music.  My favorite song on this album is English Tea.  This is a very pleasant sounding song about enjoying one of the simple pleasures in life.  Fine Line is another hit on this album.  This is an upbeat song about how people each choose their own path in life.  A Certain Softness is another highlight track on this album.  It is about how a man can become so captivated by the subtle qualities of a woman like the softness in her eyes and the sadness in her smile.  How Kind Of You is a good song about how the thoughtfulness of a friend can make such a big differences in our lives.<br /><br />  Jenny Wren is a sad and beautiful song about the effect that loneliness and poverty can have on a young girl.  Too Much Rain is an excellent song about how pain and hardship are a part of life.  Paul sings so eloquently in this  song that life always moves on and we should not dwell on the pain for too long.  Paul sounds good on the acoustic guitar, and his vocals are clear and so melodic here.  This Has Never Happened Before is a very happy song about what it feels like to fall in love for the first time.  At The Mercy is a song about we can feel overwhelmed by the the demands of life and the people we love.  There is a sense of anixety in Paul's voice on this song.  Follow Me is a beautiful love song about how someone we love gives us a sense of purpose and direction in life. I enjoyed listening to the music on this CD very much.
B00006RCOB|4.0|The first half is like a Russian Spy movie. The second half is almost like a video game showing Eastwood getting chased by other aircraft. This seemed alittle drawn out and repetitive. The ending shows him flying off in the clouds. It would have been better if they had shown him actually landing the jet and everyone welcoming him home.
B000002IAZ|5.0|Brilliant, and the inspiration for an entire genre of country rock.  Such music is timeless, as enjoyable now as forty years ago.
B000002JOH|5.0|This albums is by far one of the best Pantera as well as heavy metal albums of all time. Vulgar display represents all of the members in their prime not to metion one of the best sounding albums due to the greatness of Terry Date. If you are just begging to listen to metal this heavy, full on aggression, punch your mother in the face music is by far the best place to start.
B000002X0Z|5.0|Hell on Earth Is Another Hot Mobb Deep Album And Its Right After The Infamous So You Know Its Great I Say Get This Album Mobb Deep Is The Best Group To Me<br /><br />My Favorite 3 songs on cd is<br /><br />1.Bloodsport<br /><br />2.Man Down<br /><br />3. G.o.d Pt 3
B000001IQH|5.0|Rancid is the band that got me into punk (w/ this cd) so i might be a wee bit partial but, Rancid is one of the greatest punk bands ever.  They are both hardcore serious punks and amazing musicians.  This cd is just simply put, \\"amazing.\\"  From Maxwell Murder to The Way I Feel this cd is the best.  Matt Freeman is the greatest punk bassist to exist.
6302158249|5.0|Why are all this classic concerts not being released on DVD!?? Makes me angry...
B0001A79JO|3.0|Psychos beware, if you like poppy psychobilly this is for you.  If you're a Demented Are Go! fan save yourself the pain.  Of course if your a Demented Are Go! fan pain sounds like a blast :).
B000003JAB|4.0|This is a great disc.  Robin Trower established himself as a guitar hero playing lead for Procol Harum in the 1960's, but became such a dominant force within the band by 1971 that he decided to strike out in a 'solo' career, although, like Alice Cooper, 'Robin Trower' was adopted as the name of his band as well.  'Bridge of Sighs' is unquestionably his finest work as a solo artist/band, and it certainly sheds a new light on his artistic persuasions when you compare it with his Procol Harum endeavors.  There is nothing high-minded about 'Robin Trower'.  The band is straight forward, hard blues-rock, daring to mix in a modest helping of psychedelia by way of the wah-pedal and fuzz tone guitar sounds that characterized metal music in the late 1960's.  Trower is always at his best when he rocks out, and 'Bridge of Sighs' only comes up for air a few times. I generally skip over those respites while submerging myself in Trower's manic, riff-filled lead guitar excursions. <br /> <br />The power trio that is 'Robin Trower' includes Reg Isadore on drums (and an occasional conga or cowbell, the later being a wonerful nuance to 'Lady Love') and James Dewar on bass and vocals.  Dewar is to 'Robin Trower' as Rob Tench was to the 'Jeff Beck Group': an able vocalist whose rough delivery complements Trower's slick guitar work.  Dewar also helps pen two of the better tracks on the disc, the aforementioned 'Lady Love', and 'The Fool and Me', both of which possess some of the more appealing lyrics on the disc. <br /> <br />But 'Robin Trower' is all about guitar playing, and the opener, 'Day Of the Eagle' (perhaps the best known of all Trower compositions), along with the seven and one-half minute 'Too Rolling Stoned', and the closer, 'Little Bit Of Sympathy', form a quintet of hard-rocking numbers (along with 'Lady Love' and 'The Fool and Me') few other discs from the golden decades of rock could match.  I suppose you can't rock solid for an entire album, but 'Bridge of Sighs', whilehighly touted by some and recognized as a fine R&B track by this writer, is just too slowed-down for my tastes.  The same problem infects the two remaining tracks from the disc, the ballads 'In This Place' and 'About To Begin'. <br /> <br />As with many CD's released in the late 1980's and early 1990's, the packaging leaves much to be desired.  The cover is rather stunning, mixing simplicity with intricacy, or perhaps just mixing white paint.  The cover was designed by 'Funky Paul' Olsen, who also designed other album covers for Trower.  The lyics to the title track recall the actual Bridge of Sighs, which in Venice led prisoners to their cells.  The trek over the bridge was their last chance to take in the beauty of the city.  The remainder of the 'Bridge of Sighs' package is just as dismal for the purchaser of this disc, offering no lyrics and no images of the band.  At least we get running times along with the track listing.  Oh well, it could be worse.  We could be in prison with no Robin Trower to listen to. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000089RVX|1.0|I hear a lot of people comparing this band to Finnish metal band Nightwish, which is really unfair. The two bands are of separate genres and cannot really be compared. A better way to say it would be, if you like Nightwish, you'll hate this. If you hate Nightwish, you'll still hate this. Basically, you'll hate this. <br /> <br />Among several (dubious) accolades afforded to Evanescence, one of them is that they helped bring \\"Gothic Metal to the mainstream\\", despite the fact that they are neither metal nor Gothic (unless you go by the typical teenager's definition, whereby \\"Gothic\\" apparently means \\"whining about how horrible your life is\\"). Perhaps more relevant is the praise heaped on vocalist Amy Lee. <br /> <br />Now, I will admit that Amy Lee is an above-average vocalist, especially compared with contemparies such as Avril Lavigne. She's certainly not in the same class as Tarja Turunen of the aforementioned Nightwish, Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil, Sharon den Adel of Within Tempation, or Floor Jansen of After Forever, but she's not bad. So what's the problem? Quite simply, the band backing her is horrible. There are no memorable guitar riffs, just repetitive power chords typical of the (thankfully dead) nu-metal scene. I'm not going to review each individual track, because frankly they all sound alike. \\"Bring Me to Life\\" is quite possibly the worst track on the album, with horrid \\"rapping\\" unpleasantly reminded me of that other \\"whinge rock\\" band, Linkin Park. <br /> <br />But you know what the worst thing, the absolute WORST thing, about this album is? The lyrics. Every song is dripping with the same kind of cliched, whiney, \\"look at all my pain\\" poetry you would expect to find in some sad-sack high schooler's diary. It's the kind of angsty, non-specific malaise infesting mainstream music that's calculated to appeal exclusively to teenagers going through those turbulent years. Nothing on \\"Fallen\\" sounds genuine or heartfelt. The lyrics are pitifully self-indulgent, and are at best maudlin. \\"Save me from the nothing I've become?\\" Please. I can only imagine what those who think this album is \\"depressing\\" would think if they ever listened to something like My Dying Bride. Very bad trips would ensue. <br /> <br />My recommendation? Amy Lee should find a band more appropriate (read: talented) for her abilities. Until then, stay away from Evanescence.
B00004X01U|5.0|Two years after \\"Ray Of Light,\\" Madonna returned with \\"Music,\\" her first US #1 album since 1989's \\"Like A Prayer\\". The album married her with French producer Mirwais and was an instant smash. It debuted at #1 around the world and was preceded by the title cut, which became her twelveth #1 in the US and spent a month at the top of the Hot 100. The singles \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" both reached top ten around the world, though the latter only reached #23 in America. The former scored two MTV Video Music Award nominations: best female video and best choreography in a video. The album was nominated for the best pop vocal album Grammy and the \\"Music\\" single earned a nod for record of the year and best female pop vocal performance. \\"Music\\" secured Madonna the 2001 Brit Award for International Female - the first time she had won the trophy. \\"Music\\" has sold over 2 million units in the US and another 12 million internationally. <br /> <br />1. \\"Music\\" (10/10) <br />2. \\"Impressive Instant\\" (10/10) <br />3. \\"Runaway Lover\\" (10/10) <br />4. \\"I Deserve It\\" (10/10) <br />5. \\"Amazing\\" (10/10) <br />6. \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" (10/10) <br />7. \\"Don't Tell Me\\" (10/10) <br />8. \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" (10/10) <br />9. \\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\" (10/10) <br />10. \\"Gone\\" (9/10) <br /> <br />\\"American Pie\\" appears on the UK version of the album, and is also very good. The album's opening track, the hit single \\"Music\\", is brilliant, and definately one of the album's best moments. \\"Impressive Instant\\" certainly is impressive, and it's my fave from the album. \\"Runaway Lover\\" is another brilliant effort which cannot be missed, whereas \\"I Deserve It\\" is not as good as we've seen so far, but still brilliant. \\"Amazing\\" is also another fantastic song, and then there's \\"Nobody's Perfect\\". Madonna is right - nobody is perfect, but this song certainly is. \\"Don't Tell Me\\" is yet another cracking song, which reached both #4 in the UK and the US. Deservedly so. \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" is a fantastic song, with an equally fantastic video. \\"Paradise (Not For Me\\" maybe Madonna's spookiest song yet, along with \\"Mer Girl\\", from her previous effort \\"Ray Of Light\\". Madonna also blurts out a few French words. The last track \\"Gone\\", is easily the album's weakest, but still absolutely fab. Recommended? YES!!!! <br /> <br />My top three \\"Music\\" pics:- <br />3) Music <br />2) Don't Tell Me <br />1) Impressive Instant  <br />

B00005Q66T|5.0|Madonna's second greatest hits album condensed her 1992-2001 career into a tidy little 15-song package. While no new songs are included, nine of the tracks hit the US top ten, and all but one were UK top tens. (The lone dissenter was \\"Take A Bow,\\" which hit #16 in the UK, but was her biggest hit in the US, spending 7 weeks at #1.) To launch the album (which hit #7 in America and #2 in the United Kingdom) special megamixes of the \\"GHV2\\" hits were created for radio and dance clubs. The tracks, remixed by Thunderpuss, Tracy Young and Johnny Rocks and Mac Quayle, were a hit in dance clubs. \\"GHV2\\" has sold a million copies in America, while selling 5 million worldwide.     1. \\"Deeper And Deeper\\" (10/10)  2. \\"Erotica\\" (10/10)  3. \\"Human Nature\\" (10/10)  4. \\"Secret\\" (10/10)  5. \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" (10/10)  6. \\"Bedtime Story\\" (10/10)  7. \\"The Power Of Good-Bye\\" (10/10)  8. \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" (10/10)  9. \\"Frozen\\" (10/10)  10. \\"Take A Bow\\" (10/10)  11. \\"Ray Of Light\\" (10/10)  12. \\"Don't Tell Me\\" (10/10)  13. \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" (10/10)  14. \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\" (10/10)  15. \\"Music\\" (10/10)    Just like Madonna's first greatest hits album, \\"The Immaculate Collection\\", all of the tracks are brilliant and get 10/10 in my personal opinion. Some are edited, some are the original album versions, but either way, they're all excellent tracks in their own unique way. From the beginning of the album, the feel-good disco song \\"Deeper And Deeper\\", to the number one smash, \\"Music\\", where the album finishes, all tracks are FANTASTIC. Also, the delightful \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" makes its first appearance on a Madonna album! Since I've shared my thoughts on most of the tracks already, I'll give their American chart positions instead. \\"Deeper And Deeper\\" (#7), \\"Erotica\\" (#3), \\"Human Nature\\" (#46), \\"Secret\\" (#3), \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" (#8), \\"Bedtime Story\\" (#42), \\"The Power Of Good-Bye\\" (#11), \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" charted at #19 in America only due toits airplay, going 17 places higher in the UK at #2, \\"Frozen\\" (#2), \\"Take A Bow\\" (#1), \\"Ray Of Light\\" (#5), \\"Don't Tell Me\\" (#4), \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" (#23), \\"Drowned World\\" was not released in the US, but hit #10 in the UK, \\"Music\\" (#1). Some tracks are missing from this album. The tracks missing (that were not on Madonna's 1995 album \\"Something To Remember\\") are \\"Bad Girl\\" (#36), \\"American Pie\\" (#29 in US due to airplay, but a #1 in the UK!!) and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\", which is a good-even-if-it-flopped single. (It charted at #93 in America.) \\"Fever\\", the UK #6 hit, could've also been included. The dance version of \\"Argentina\\" should've also been included instead of the original. Still, GHV2 is great for your Madonna collection.     My top three \\"Greatest Hits Volume 2 (GHV2)\\" pics:-  3) Bedtime Story  2) Deeper And Deeper  1) Take A Bow
B00001OH7N|5.0|In the carear of David Bowie he has created many of the worlds greatest albums, songs and styles of music. No one Bowie album is like another and this, The Man Who Sold The World is one that manages to somehow stand out more then almost any other album the man has ever created. The Man Who Sold The World rock's harder then any other album Bowie ever made, and it's the most straight forward rock album the man ever made and is probabley David Bowie's most accesable album as well. Featuring The Spiders From Mars this album is sure to please. Mick Ronson's guitar playing is the best on here, this album is easily one of the greatest guitar albums ever, this show why Ronson was one of the best. David's vocals as always thrill and his songwriting is more rock and roll then anything else and its great.<br /><br />The album opens up with what is David Bowie's all time best song, 'The Width Of A Circle' this eight minute plus song is the hardest rocker Bowie ever made and is just such a cool song that must be heard to appreciate. Mick Ronson play's his all time best guitar solo ever on this track as well. The perfect opener! 'All The Madman' is another heavy rocker, not as hard but really heavy. Great lyrics and Bowie's amazing voacals and Viscotti's bass playing make this a truly great song. The next song, 'Black Country Rock' is one of the better songs on the album with a killer riff and solo by Ronson and Bowie's nice vocals this song comes across almost as something that should have been on Led Zeppelin I. 'After All' is a slower, darker song with errie vocals from David. The lyrics are really good, but the \\"Oh By Jingo\\" thing is kinda weird but that doesnt mean its bad, just weird. 'Running Gun Blues' is a great song about a serial killer felling guilty and sorry. Not one of the best songs on the album but still a good track. 'Saviour Machine' is a cool song about \\"The Church\\" and how people devote their whole lives to something they really have no prove about. Nice lyrics and pretty catchy as well. The next song is another one that really shows off Mick Ronson's amazing guitar playng ability. The heavyly distorted wah-wah pedal and slide guitar add a really nice touch to this already killer song. 'She Shook Me Cold' is another song that could have been on Led Zeppelin I, but then again this song is too good for Led Zeppelin I so never mind. Next is the legendary title track, \\"The Man Who Sold The World' which was covered by Nirvana on their unplugged album which they did decent but dont truly do justice as Bowie's original is just amazing. The lyrics are some of the best ever written by anyone, and the delivery is just flat out fantastic. Truly one of Bowie's brighter moments. The album closes with the right song, 'The Supermen' is just the song to end The Man Who Sold The World, because its hard and it rocks and it leaves you wanting more and not being able to wait untill you buy your next David Bowie album. Everyone really come together on this track, the lyrics are good as well as Bowie vocals the bass and drums flow perfectly and Mick's guitar is not to be challenged.<br /><br />The Man Who Sold The World is easily one of David Bowie's all time best albums, as there is no filler and all the songs rock. this album is a true gem in a collection of albums full of gems. Do yourself a favor and get this largly overlooked classic!rics and pretty catchy as well. The next song is another one that really shows off Mick Ronson's amazing guitar playng ability.

B00008S2VG|5.0|In 2003, Madonna returned with her fifteenth album, which featured all new tracks. Two of the new tracks were the singles \\"Die Another Day\\" and \\"American Life\\", which hit #8 and #37 in America respectively. In the UK, they scored a bigger success, and went #3 and #2 respectively. \\"Hollywood\\" was also a #2 single in the UK, but suprisingly failed to chart the US. \\"Love Profusion\\" also hit #11 in the UK, and out of interest, \\"Nothing Fails\\" scored #7 in Canada. The album \\"American Life\\" scored #1 in the US and the UK, as it did in more than 15 countries, but many considered it a flop. \\"American Life\\" fell of the Billboard Top 200 in 14 weeks time, whereas it fell off the UK charts in 19 weeks time. It sold 1 million copies in the US, and 5 million worldwide, just like Madonna's previous, \\"Greatest Hits Volume 2\\".     1. \\"American Life\\" (10/10)  2. \\"Hollywood\\" (10/10)  3. \\"I'm So Stupid\\" (10/10)  4. \\"Love Profusion\\" (10/10)  5. \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" (10/10)  6. \\"Nothing Fails\\" (10/10)  7. \\"Intervention\\" (10/10)  8. \\"X-Static Process\\" (10/10)  9. \\"Mother And Father\\" (10/10)  10. \\"Die Another Day\\" (10/10)  11. \\"Easy Ride\\" (10/10)    \\"American Life\\" is by far better than some people claim it to be. It should not have been as under-rated as it is. To make my review short, as I want to discuss other things instead, I'll just say all of the tracks are fantastic. Brilliant. Fabulous. Excellent. I'd also recommend you pick up \\"Remixed And Revisited\\", as it too is a brill album and includes remixed versions of some of the tracks from this album! Now...as much as I like Mariah, her little team-lamb gang are just stupid. Madonna has sold more records than Mariah - just check in the Guiness Book Of Hit Singles And Albums. Just because you are jealous, and to get your fave artist on the top, doesn't mean you have to trash another artist. Especially Madonna. What losers. They are also trying to trash people like Janet Jackson, Queen Of R'n'B. Well, I can't wait for Madonna's next album.Oops, I forgot. It arrives in November in the name and shape of \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\". I'm down those shops. And Team-lamb ain't gonna stop me. They ain't gonna stop any other Madonna fan either. \\"American Life\\" is totally recommended, as are any of Madonna's albums.     My top three \\"American Life\\" pics:-  3) I'm So Stupid  2) Die Another Day  1) Nothing Fails

David's vocals as always thrill and his songwriting is more rock and roll then anything else and its great.<br /><br />The album opens up with what is David Bowie's all time best song, 'The Width Of A Circle' this eight minute plus song is the hardest rocker Bowie ever made and is just such a cool song that must be heard to appreciate. Mick Ronson play's his all time best guitar solo ever on this track as well. The perfect opener! 'All The Madman' is another heavy rocker, not as hard but really heavy. Great lyrics and Bowie's amazing voacals and Viscotti's bass playing make this a truly great song. The next song, 'Black Country Rock' is one of the better songs on the album with a killer riff and solo by Ronson and Bowie's nice vocals this song comes across almost as something that should have been on Led Zeppelin I. 'After All' is a slower, darker song with errie vocals from David. The lyrics are really good, but the \\"Oh By Jingo\\" thing is kinda weird but that doesnt mean its bad, just weird. 'Running Gun Blues' is a great song about a serial killer felling guilty and sorry. Not one of the best songs on the album but still a good track. 'Saviour Machine' is a cool song about \\"The Church\\" and how people devote their whole lives to something they really have no prove about. Nice lyrics and pretty catchy as well. The next song is another one that really shows off Mick Ronson's amazing guitar playng ability. The heavyly distorted wah-wah pedal and slide guitar add a really nice touch to this already killer song. 'She Shook Me Cold' is another song that could have been on Led Zeppelin I, but then again this song is too good for Led Zeppelin I so never mind. Next is the legendary title track, \\"The Man Who Sold The World' which was covered by Nirvana on their unplugged album which they did decent but dont truly do justice as Bowie's original is just amazing. The lyrics are some of the best ever written by anyone, and the delivery is just flat out fantastic. Truly one of Bowie's brighter moments. The album closes with the right song, 'The Supermen' is just the song to end The Man Who Sold The World, because its hard and it rocks and it leaves you wanting more and not being able to wait untill you buy your next David Bowie album. Everyone really come together on this track, the lyrics are good as well as Bowie vocals the bass and drums flow perfectly and Mick's guitar is not to be challenged.<br /><br />But This version of the album features 'Lightining Frighting' 'Holy Holy' 'Moonage Daydream' and 'Hang On To Yourslef' all of which are Bowie Classics and make this version of the album even better then the original!<br /><br />The Man Who Sold The World is easily one of David Bowie's all time best albums, as there is no filler and all the songs rock. this album is a true gem in a collection of albums full of gems. Do yourself a favor and get this largly overlooked classic!rics and pretty catchy as well. The next song is another one that really shows off Mick Ronson's amazing guitar playng ability.

0380789019|4.0|Just like the young adult series \\"Gregor the Overlander\\", Neil Gaiman's clever adult fantasy \\"Neverwhere\\" takes you way down below the surface of a major city, and reveals a world far different to ours - a more dangerous world, where nothing is what it seems, nobody is who they appear to be, and the smells are even worse.<br /><br />This highly imaginative and captivating story takes place in, below and between the streets of London, and starts when hapless Richard Mayhew is on his way to dinner with his fianc&eacute;e and her boss, a powerful media tycoon.  As fate would have it, a bedraggled, injured young girl comes between him and his fiancee's plans for his future, and before he can focus his thoughts he is deeply involved in an underworld plot that he can't begin to understand, much less extricate himself.<br /><br />Colorful characters, dark humor and punny place names highlight the story, and the two really bad guys Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar are the best of the lot. The girl of course is far more important to the scheme of things than one would believe, and as the last known survivor of a family massacre, her special talent is in high demand, particularly to Croup and Vandemar's employer.<br /><br />With reluctant Richard, an Amazonian bodyguard, and a cunning con man named the Marquis of Carabas, the girl, with the unlikely name of Door, sets out on a quest to find out who wanted her family killed, and why.  Their journey takes them to a floating market that changes location each market day, through sewers, unused Underground railway stations, a monastery of Black Friars, through a labyrinth, and to an angel named Islington.<br /><br />Richard learns the hard way how to save himself from himself, and emerges from the living nightmare a much stronger and dirtier person. By the conclusion, he knows that home is where the heart is, and there's no place like home.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 18, 2005
B0007ZIYWY|5.0|Normally I can't stand the reissue but when it comes to Sonic Youth, you gotta let it slide. <br /> <br />You have the record in it's remasted entiretity along with all the B-Sides from the \\"Goo\\" era of Sonic Youth. <br /> <br />The liner notes are a nice touch. <br /> <br />The Gem here is Disc 2... The demos of the songs that make up Goo.  To see what the songs started as and to what they became is an amazing listening experience.  What you want to do is listen to the demo and then the actual album version from Goo back to back and check out the care and craft that Sonic Youth goes into making a record.  You hear these rough recordings and you get to see behind the curtain.  That alone is worth the price of this 2 CD set.  <br /> <br />This should tide you over until the next Sonic Youth release... or maybe a Dirty reissue????????
B00005JOHU|5.0|This is another brilliant performance by Nicolas Cage a Ukranian immigrant arms dealer who lives a secret life from his family.  The movie is fun throughout and raises a lot of moral questions.  Cage is basically a nice guy who is in \\"business\\" because he is \\"good\\" at what he does.  When he is made to see what his work is causing, he has to choose between his \\"career\\" and doing what is right.
B00003CXDB|4.0|Michael Douglas does a great job a playing characters you hate because they are so evil - and this movie is no exception.  Sheen in wonderful as well as many feel this is his best roll ever.  The High Powered world of stocks and bonds in the 80s is the focal point of this movie as yuppie greed is in the liberal flower power of decades past is nowhere to be found.  An excellent drama that is well worth it.
B000AL730O|5.0|OVERALL COMPARED WITH MOST OF HIS ALBUMS THIS IS GREAT. A LOT OF SOLID SONGS. ONE OF THE REVIEWERS DOESN'T LIKE THIS ALBUM, BUT LIKES FLAMING PIE? I DON'T GET IT, BUT OKAY. THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM FOR PAUL. IT'S MELLOW AND SWEET. WHOEVER SAID WHERE IS THE OLD PAUL, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THIS ALBUM HAS SONGS BETTER THEN MOST OF HIS OLDER ONES.
B000001A3H|4.0|Firstly, to truly appreciate this music, you need to crank up the volume on whichever staro you're using and put the bass to maximum. Then, all that remains to do is to sit back, relax and allow the legend that is kyuss to stomp all over you... <br /> <br />This is the second album I picked up by these guys. The first was \\"Welcome to Sky Valley\\", and it was immense. My only niggle was with the track format. So deciding that I liked that album I bought this, and was literally floored by the sheer heaviness of the riffs and driving nature of all their songs. <br /> <br />From it's opener \\"Thumb\\" (a true classic and one of the best album openers I've heard in a while) to it's modestly amusing finale (\\"...yeah\\"), I was certainly left shaken and stirred to my guts, and in awe of one of the most defining bands of the \\"stoner rock\\" genre. <br /> <br />If this is the initial foray you wish to make into Kyuss, then I would agree that this album is more \\"accessible\\" than others, but listener beware: your eardrums may never be able to register low frequencies again. <br /> <br />This album is sublime, but I only rate it 4 stars because there are one or two tracks where the band have clearly indulged themselves, and the result is that there are some \\"blips in the trip\\", but on the whole, this album is phenomenal. <br /> <br />Defining moments include \\"Thumb\\", \\"Green Machine\\" and 50 million year trip (where the group demonstrate that they can do melodic as well as crushing). <br /> <br />Highly recommended. Now buy it and be prepared to headbang...
B000AA305M|5.0|David Gray offers some of the best pairings of poetry and melody out there today. Whether you're going to chill out, reflect, brood, or get up and dance, then Gray's your guy. I'd personally recommend all his stuff, especially his first 3 albums that were underexposed.     Just like those early ones, with Life in Slow Motion you could very easily find yourself saying to your friends and loved ones \\"Whoa, this sounds a lot like us, doesn't it?\\" As in \\"Ain't No Love\\", you can almost feel the singer's yearning, then you wonder if he's really found any comfort at the end. And in \\"Nos da Cariad\\", you're awash in a saddened sort of imagery, a musical journey where you \\"hold on to St. Christopher\\" for help across troubled waters, then you're \\"running\\" to or from something for reasons of your own imagination. We're given a truly timeless opportunity with each song.    Sometimes we may feel trapped or hopeless, like we can \\"almost see the sea\\"... but the total song experience brings us back to the beauty of David Gray's work... musical warmth through the cold, hard truths of love, loss and plain ol' existence... slowly learning how to catch the moments that really mean something. Yes! Please buy Life in Slow Motion... nothing feels like the experience of David Gray's music. He and the band draw out the purest sense of any song, using any kind of effect, to show everything that's great in music. And Gray's singing is especially good on this album, some darker undertones, but the beautiful choruses shine right through them. Phenomenal artistry.
B0007M22TI|5.0|This is a wonderful CD and DVD. By all means, check this out. It will take you on an incredible journey of sound and sight. <br /> <br />Who is the incredible woman on the cover of the CD & DVD though??
0783227434|3.0|After watching the first two movies of the Evil Dead, the Army of Darkness was a sort of a let down.  This version of the movie has no special features, and while the movie itself is funny rather than scary, I was really disappointed in not being able to listen to any commentary by the director or actors.  I would like to get my hands on a different version of the movie, though, with commentary because it is an entertaining show.
B0000026UV|5.0|<br />Product was in excellent condition when I received it.  I paid a reasonable price for the quality of the product I received.
B00008973A|1.0|I saw the Broadway show several times and loved it. The movie is overblown and is not faithful to the original Broadway production. The dancing is great, Michel Douglas' performance is way over the top and the singing is fair at best. What a disapointment. Attenborough should have remained faithful to the original script and characterizations.
0385513755|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Then Katrina hit and it got swept away in the waters.  We survived, Yeah!  What a beautiful book to have lost.  Plan to have it again once the mess is cleaned up!!
0446677450|5.0|Yes this is a great book. But the content boils down to a motivational speech about oversimplified common sense {common sense repeated a lot and in a lot of different ways}. That being said, there's a great reason to repeat common sense rules like Kiyosaki does in Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Sometimes common sense just isn't as common as we think it is. Maybe the reason the book sells so well is people need to here them, because as simple as they are, people just aren't getting them.<br /><br />Yes, Kiyosaki is short on specifics. But then, if you want to know how to pick stocks, what rules to use when buying real estate, or how to hire contractors you should expect to buy more than one book. Maybe that's why there's a list of further readings in many of Kiyosaki's books. Many of those books weren't written by Kiyosaki {a real sign of a selfish guru &lt;- sarcasm.}<br /><br />Most negative reviewers are looking for easy answers to stock picking and real estate investmensts. They're angry Kiyosaki doesn't give them. He's clear why he doesn't. And he gives you plenty of leads to investigate further. Those people who didn't take the time to investigate any further deserve what doesn't come to them.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|The fifth season of Gilmore Girls might as well be named the Luke-Lorelai season, because basically that's what it was. From their first date, to thier breaking up, to Lorelai popping the question, it is obvious to me that they belong together. The break-up showed that. Luke was miserable without her, trying to find excuses to be near her, and Lorelai couldn't sit up! The whole point of the short break-up was to show that they belong together. It would be a major dissapointment to me if Luke and Lorelai didn't end the series together. After the great Luke-Lorelai romance, where could they go? Bring back Christopher? I don't think so. <br /> <br />On to Rory... seasons 1-3 were basically about Lorelai and Rory. Thier relationship, and being best friends. When Rory went off to college, it was hard for them to stay as close. Despite a few exceptions(Rory visiting Lorelai in bed after Luke breaks up with her) there were few great Lorelai-Rory moments this season.  This makes sense, because Rory is off to college, so some seperation is inevitable. Rory... has changed, and needless to say that has made many Rory fans unhappy. However, I think change is inevitable, especially when going off to college. And you can't blame it all on Logan. Although I don't nesesarrilly condone Rory's actions, I think her changes are more realistic than if should would have stayed exactly the same from ages 16-20. <br /> <br />I liked Logan. I have to say that he was better than Dean, and way better the Jess(the jerk). Logan treats her right, so what he likes to have some fun? What has he really done to Rory or while he was with Rory that was all that bad? He stood up to his family when they attacked her at the dinner. Rory dragged him to steal the yacht, not the other way around. Rory needs to be blamed for her own actions, not Logan. <br /> <br />All that being said, I really hope that they can repair the Lorelai-Rory relationship in season six, and I am pleading with the producers, PLEASEsign Scott Patterson for season 7! <br /> <br />Overall, great season, with more great stuff to come! <br /> <br />
B00067ZONA|5.0|FROM THE FORMATION OF GENESIS THEIR LINE-UP AS WELL AS THEIR MARTERIAL HAS EVOLVED FROM THE MUSICALLY EXOTIC TO COMMERCIAL CHART OFFERINGS.THIS COMPLILATION IS A VERY GOOD OVERVIEW THAT COVERS THEIR HISTORY.I FOR ONE AM A PETER GABRIEL FAN AND HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO GENESIS ARE MY FAVOURITES.I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF PHIL COLLINS AS A \\"DRUMMER\\" WHO SINGS, AND THIS LEADS TO THEIR RISE TO A BROADER FAN BASE.THIS RELEASE IS WELL WORTH ADDING TO YOUR COLLECTION. DAN SNEDDON
B0006399FS|1.0|All that u2 can't leave behind: the tours, the adulation ... the money?  What other reason is there for making music like this?  There is no inspiration here (except for Vertigo, which is a sort of tribute piece to their own earlier music).  The band sounds like it's swimming in a vat of liquid Zoloft.   Rock music is a young man's game, there is nothing wrong with LEAVING IT BEHIND and preserving one's dignity.  As it is, they are like a civil servant putting in his 30 years to maximize his pension, but with all their money they don't even have that excuse.
B000A5044C|5.0|Place this one on the shelf of films that take children seriously and, at the same time, are themselves serious works of art. \\"Ponette,\\" \\"My Father's Glory,\\" Malle's \\"Au Revoir les Enfants,\\" Truffault's \\"Small Change\\" and \\"The 400 Blows,\\" Bergman's \\"Fanny and Alexander,\\" DeSica's \\"Shoe Shine\\" and \\"The Bicycle Thief,\\" a couple of films from Iran, the shelf is a short but elevated one. \\"Nobody Knows\\" is one of the great films about childhood that nobody knows. This DVD release is certain to change that.     It is not a sentimental movie. Yet it has sentiment in it and so much honesty that it hurts to watch. It is based on a true story about four children abandoned by their mother in a tiny Tokyo apartment that shocked Japan, adding to the poignancy of what Hirokazu Koreeda has directed. His camera unhurriedly records how the children survive, the toll that takes on their childhood, and the responsibilities that burden the 12-year-old son, played by Yuya Yagira, who won a Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival.    You will sense the disinterested solicitude of the mother. In contrast, the two fathers of his siblings and other adults the boy meets in seeking money and food are kind and helpful. A team coach at the school the kids long to attend invites the boy to play baseball, and he comes alive. Koreeda provides a patina of hope that slowly fades as the family unravels and one of the children dies. How the boy and a friend transport and bury the body will make your heart flinch. Don't miss this little gem.
0385486804|5.0|Well written.  I started reading this and hours went by before I could put it down.  Having had the same dreams as Chris, and understanding his philosophy on life, made me want to do the same thing.  He died living the life he loved, ignoring the unpleasantries of modern society.  I hope his life and death at least provide a lesson about being prepared to tackle a solitary life in the wild, it his hard and the wilderness of Alaska makes it a thousand times more dangerous than other the other places in the US.  The book also relates of others who had met the ultimate fate by going \\"Into the Wild\\".   The writer's style keeps your interest and he is not prejudiced or preachy, he simple relates what happened.
B00000ILGB|5.0|Well, Amon Duul II is a serious case, at least the ultimate psychedelic group from Continental Europe, so idiosyncratic in their music and imagery... The Yeti album, with it's diverse paths, alternating acoustic and electric, is a kind of expedition through a dream-like land...Archangel's Thunderbird is psychedelia at most exciting, the voice of Renate Knaup emulating a Grace Slick mood, but with a more killer attitude, the stormy guitar \\"singing\\" side-by-side her voice...This album is a skin-shivering experience, it contains what must be the most terrifying song in rock universe, the mind-blowing \\"Eye-Shaking King\\" with that exorcist-like vocals and aggressive guitars...Finally, an important word to the aesthetic aspect of the group, so powerful as the music, people dancing in a ghostly-manner upon a mountain, anguish without-a-face masks, the esplendid image of death in the front cover, lysergic horses, altered states of conscience and panic colors!!!! A MUST!!!!!  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00009Z574|2.0|Well, curiousity finally gets the best of me. After having recently been obcessing the band YES (for the last 5 years anyway), I had to breakdown and buy this album, the remastered CD with bonus material no less. Now, after hearing >Tormato&lt;, I can cease. Not that this is as bad as others say it is, but its definately a case of the wheels coming off the wagon.  <br /> <br />There are some good ideas here and there, but the songs on this CD are nowhere near fleshed out enough or brought to any satisfying conclusion. This surprises me since this album was written within a year of the superb return-to-form album, >Going For The One&lt;. Oh, there are a few moments ala GFT1, like 'Onward', 'Madrigal', and 'Future Times', but there are also some cringe inducing moments like 'Don't Kill The Whale', 'Arriving UFO' and 'Circus Of Heaven', the latter sounding similar to the drivel coming from >Olias Of Sunhillow&lt;, Anderson's solo album from around the same time. <br /> <br />While songs like 'Release Release' and 'Silent Wings Of Freedom' herald the direction future YES albums would take, they definately hadn't mastered the sound on this album (the last time Rick Wakeman would record with the group for 15 years). Squire, Howe, and White would go on to make the superb >Drama&lt; album (w/ Jeff Downes and Trevor Horn), though few ever heard it. Both >Drama&lt; and >90125&lt; owe a tip of the hat to >Tormato&lt;. Hey, you don't get good veggies without a little manure. <br /> <br />This disc is rich in bonus material; more out-takes and demos than actual songs, but some of them more compelling than some of the original tracks. One of them, called, 'Everybody's Song' is an early demo of the eventual >Drama&lt; track, 'Does It Really Happen', with Jon doing the vocal. As much as Trevor Horn deserves props for his contribution to the YES canon, it would have been great to hear Jon singing on the >Drama&lt; album. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002H6C|5.0|Actually, 4 1/2 stars.     Great album with some raw sound and songs. As I said before, James Hetfield is THE voice of metal and totally rocks each and every song, accomplished by the fast drums of Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett and Jason Newsted on guitar and bass. The only problem is the riffs seem to carry on way too long to the point where you forget the song and the words get lost. That's my only gripe.    Favorite songs is definitely \\"One\\" and \\"Blackened.\\" All the songs are great, of course, but those two stick out the most.
B00005JOHU|4.0|I'm kind of shocked to see poor reviews of this film here at Amazon.com. I think part of the reason some individuals didn't enjoy the film is that they didn't explore the depths of the characters very well; and this is definitely a character-driven film.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is perfect at Yuri Olav, a Ukrainian native who's family moved to America years before. They run a substandard Russian restaurant that serves borscht (beet soup) as a staple. Their father has become a devout Jew. And Yuri and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM) help with the restaurant. Then one day, after witnessing a failed assassination attempt, Yuri receives an epiphany: everyone needs guns. Thus the stage is set for him to become one of the premiere arms dealers in the world.<br /><br />Against the backdrop of Yuri's life, we get to see the effects of his chosen profession upon his brother's psyche. Vitaly gets into drugs and women, anything he can to help him forget that he and his brother are involved in a business that allows people to kill other people. And when Yuri gives up gun running for a while, Vitaly too comes back to a semblance of normalcy. But when Yuri returns to guns, and asks Vitaly to join him, the stress becomes overwhelming (this is something that I have yet to see any other reviewer comment on and, the way Jared Leto pulls off his excellent portrayal of Yuri's brother, it's a pretty powerful message.)<br /><br />I also think that many reviewers may not understand the mentality of a sociopath. Their moral compass is broken, according to our standards. So when Yuri (Cage) doesn't grow out of his morally ambiguous state, it didn't surprise me one little bit.<br /><br />Also, Nicholas Cage is a deadpan actor, and that's probably why they chose him. Remember RAISING ARIZONA and the diaper scene in the convenience store? Or LEAVING LAS VEGAS? Or BRINGING OUT THE DEAD? Cage was the only person I could think of who could pull off a convincing Yuri.<br /><br />I also need to comment on the brutal message that smacks the viewer. From the opening sequence in the film where we see Yuri standing in a war-torn street surrounded by a paved street covered in spent gun shells, to the scene where Vitaly witnesses the execution of children in Africa, there's not a single moment in the film where the biting reality of what Yuri does and how it effects those around him isn't displayed.<br /><br />One thing that really intrigued me, too, is that I saw the film's trailer on TV long before the movie came out, and they always showed the bit where Yuri is in the airport and is approached by agents from the ATF, and Yuri says \\"I guess this isn't about the alcohol or tobacco.\\" I laughed at the trailer. But interestingly enough, once that scene came up on screen in context to the rest of the plot, there was very little comedy in it and the message much more powerful and poignant.<br /><br />This film definitely had it's comedic moments, but laughing at it is oft-times painful to think about because of what we see Yuri and his brother go through later.i.  <br /> <br />I also need to comment on the brutal message that smacks the viewer.

0446343129|5.0|William Dufty's book was an addictive read, very hard to put down. Read it, get the motivation to go sugarfree, feel great, but warnings - research sweetener alternatives before using them. Make sure the research did not come from the company that made the product, to avoid bias. <br /> <br />My suggestions are Stevia for tea, xylitol for anything else. We found like others that the first month was the hardest, but after that, sucrose cravings went away, and a piece of fruit or some sultanas were enough to stem any desire.
B000003S0P|5.0|I just recently discovered this album from '74 (about two years ago). Wow, is this an undiscovered gem or what. I'm sure most of you have heard and/or owned this before but I'm amazed that these 'Red' era Krim albums weren't more apart of the American psyhci like other acts from the past; less talented bands like bands like Deep Purple, Three Dog Night, et el.  <br /> <br />Having heard all the other Krim incarnations from the '80s and '90s, I can easily say that this line up of Fripp, Wetton, Bruford (and intermittantly Mel Collins and David Cross) are the standout cast compared to the latter day line-ups. <br /> <br />The title track ranks among the best rock instrumental of all time. A full tilt, aural wall of sound with a superb rythm section and one of Fripps finest moments, with a bass cello solo mid-section thats as menacing as any modern heavy metal song that comes to mind. No need to break every song down though; every song that follows is a gem.  <br /> <br />This is probably the most straight forward rock album that Fripp had done to this point, with very little (if any) improv and coherently structured songs that do jam but don't require a lot of patience for a payoff. I'm not a huge fan of free-wheeling jazz style improv anyway, so this album was immediately accessible to me. <br /> <br />This is one of the more underappreciated rock albums of all time. I realize that statement sounds extreme, but this CD is still in my current rotation, as is the other two 'Red' era classics. I highly recommend this HDCD, as the sonics bely the era from which it was recorded and released. I rate 5 stars only because there was no 6 star rating.
0792163710|5.0|If you've read the novel by Jack Schaefer on which this movie is based (and if you haven't, you should remedy that situation!), you know that Alan Ladd doesn't really match the description of Shane that's in the book. Not in appearance, or in dress. Nevertheless, Ladd is perfect in the role.  <br />As others have pointed out, Shane is an enigma. We know he's a gunfighter running away from his past. Does that mean he used to take the kind of jobs for which Ryker hired Wilson? If so, how did such a decent man ever get into that kind of work? (Note Shane's face when he first meets Joey and smiles down at him. It perfectly captures the gentleness and kindness of the character. A powerful contrast with the sneering smile of Jack Palance's Wilson. Two men of completely opposite character and principles -- yet they somehow ended up in the same profession). <br />A truly great movie, based on a great book.
B00000720W|4.0|When one think's of Mayhem, bleak black metal and a \\"satanic\\" image are surely the first thing to come in one's mind. This is it, early Mayhem, simple and brutal. First i'd like to adress some topics other than Deathcrush. Many have stated \\"This is underground for one reason, cause they suck!\\" Shall we think about this for one moment? Good Charlottle, Green day and that awful emo music is mainstream and everybody knows of it. Does that make it good!? NO. When looking at it as such, why should being underground make Mayhem suck? Also, is this album complicated full of intricate guitar work? No. Did they get better with their insturments as years went on? Yes. Murder, suicide, church burning and line-up changes have followed Mayhem like the plague. In the end though, under the corpse paint, behind the gimmick, lies one thing. The music, which in the end truly speaks for its self. The first track \\"Sylvester Anfang\\" is pretty much a drum intro that reminds me alot of \\"Grand Declaration of War\\" (even though at the time it would not be released for 13 years) Next up, is the title track. Which is dark grimy and bm in glory. However, complicated it is not. I learned the guitar in about 10 minutes top. One of the best song's here. Next up, is the classic song \\"Chainsaw Gutsf*ck\\" lyrical poetry it is not, infact the lyrics are pretty lame here. The song however, which is probably the slowest here, is quite dark. Probably my favorite song here. A cover of Venom's  \\"Witching Hour\\" is up next, sure it is worth a listen but I really do not enjoy Mayhem covering song's. Necrolust follows, you can probably take a guess of the lyrical content by the song name. One of the faster song's here, begins with a dark single guitar riff. Most of the solo's here just seem to be frantically played but are pulled off pretty well. (Weird) Manheim follows, definetly a weird track as the title says. Has a good bass intro. The final track, Pure F*cking Armageddon has the same intro as the song before it. The song is just as the title says. A fast paced closing song that take's no prisoners. Sums up the album pretty well.<br /><br />So, if you're curious about Mayhem, this isn't the place to start. However, if you love black metal this is MANDATORY listening. Black Metal's roots are here. However, if you hate it and are looking for atleast one bm band/album to get into, this won't be it. Infact it will probably make you hate it more. Either way, enjoy.re it. The song is just as the title says. A fast paced closing song that take's no prisoners.

0060005688|4.0|I liked the parts on \\"Measuring Happiness\\" (page 105-116) and \\"Social Comparison\\" (page 187-200). <br /> <br />Money matters - but money doesn't matter as much as we think it does. Yes, people in rich countries are happier than people in poor countries.  But once society's level of per capita wealth crosses the threshold of poverty and into adequate subsistence, further wealth have negligible effect on happiness. <br /> <br />\\"How I am doing?\\" often almost always carries \\"compared to others\\" in parentheses. The more social comparison one does, the more likely one will be affected by it - and the result is often negative. The world of adundant options encourages a process that will leave us feeling worse about our decisions than we would if we hadn't engaged in it in the first place. <br /> <br />Be Happy. Just Enough Is Good Enough. More is Less, Less is More.
B000003S0I|4.0|I purchased this remastered CD when I bought RED. RED is my favorite of the two, but the dynamics on this '73 recording is astounding. This HDCD version really belies its age.  <br /> <br />This CD isn't as immediately appealing to me as RED was, but after further listening, there are songs on this CD that are indispencible, like 'Lark's pt2' and 'Easy Money'. 'Lark's pt 1' is way over long, meanders, without really going anywhere. 'The Talking Drum' also wanders aimlessly and was probably aimed at the dope smoking beatnick crowd of its day. These two songs represent the fascination with mideastern and north African sounds that a lot of bands and critics had back then. But songs like 'Book Of Saturday' are not unlike the songs you heard from Led Zep or Deep Purple, short wistful tunes that radio loved back in the day. 'Exiles' is one of the slower, longer tunes but does have a beginning and ending and coherent lyrics, beautifully sung by Wetton. The aforementioned 'Lark's pt2' is heard on just about every live CD Fripp ever released under the Krim moniker, so it doesn't bear discussing, but 'Easy Money' is one of this line-up's better songs, with one of the coolest basslines in Krim history. <br /> <br />Recommended.
0783233086|3.0|This adaptation of the Fannie Flag book (At the Whistlestop Cafe) encompasses fifty years of memories of Cleo Threadgoode, a resident of a nursing home in the 1980s.  It is the story of Idgie who had trouble coping with the death of her beloved brother, and, as an 82-yr-old woman, remembers things as if they happened just yesterday.  In May, an old woman told me in detail how her husband had been drowned maybe forty years ago and she recited it as if it were a recent incident.    At the Fair, a man approached me and said he had told his wife when he saw me enter one of the talent tents, \\"she is right out of that movie,\\" and he had chills all over his body.  I didn't know whether to be flattered or scared.  In my memory, it was a 'funny' movie, as Fannie Flag is a funny person, but I checked it out of the library to see why he got goose bumps just seeing me, a stranger.  I realize I could have been any of the four women at different stages of my life, but I'm not as old as the elder Idgie.  That, however, is probably who he was thinking of; who knows?    It took place in the 1930s Alabama area I know well, but I was not born then!  During Idgie's growing-up summer, that rascal Frank Bennett tried to smooth talk her, and she asked him \\"Are you a politician or just a liar?\\"  Is there a difference?  Her brother's girlfriend from Valdosta, Georgia, ends up married to the cruel, aggressive man who is just like Norman Lynch who married my sister Evelyn.  The Evelyn in this movie makes changes in her life from a dowdy housefrau to a svelve salesperson for Mary Kay, thanks to her friendship with old Ms. Threadgoode.    Idgie called herself a bee charmer from Alabama with her innate courage, though she was such a tom boy.  I tried to charm a horse I called Silver at the rodeo, but he wasn't very happy with me. I had better luck with the calves, one of which I yelled \\"run\\" and he did outrun the horse and rider who would have hobbled him.  He got away.  Like Idgie got away withher \\"crime\\" as it was self-defense.    Poor Evelyn was going through the change of life and felt 'too young to be old and too old to be young.'  Sound familiar?  She wished that wrinkles could be declared sexually desirable.  Frank had been a member of the klan and outed at the cross burning.  His son, Buddy, Jr., met the same fate as his namesake.    The murder case was dismissed on Sept. 30, 1933, as \\"nobody wants to hang a woman.\\"  They did Mary Sarratt!  After Ruth dies of cancer, Cleo is left at loose ends.  In her old age, she admitted \\"Death scares me so, but it isn't nothing to be afraid of.\\"  She told Evelyn, \\"I changed and didn't like what I saw in the mirror.\\"  I changed my mind, she opined, and Evelyn told her, \\"You're sweet.\\"  As I told the fortyish man from Atlanta, when he tried to pick me up a week ago.  And I told the guard who gave me so much pain that I spoke of it at the City Council meeting that I would tell the Mayor I had changed mine when he seemed repentant.  I told him that I wrote he had apologized to me, which threw him for a loop.  He is too young to know that it takes a big man to apologize.    Best friends are the most important thing in life, and we make so few of them.  The heart of this train stop town stopped beating when the cafe was torn down as it had brought so many people together.  There is one near KMart which has advertised Fried Green Tomatoes outside for years now -- only on Thursdays, year round.  I've asked other bus patrons if that is the only time they cook those, and no one knows.  I still have not gone in the diner to ask about that perplexing ad out front.    This was a cute movie, and well acted and directed.  All were stars even the handsome brother.  I especially like men with blue eyes, though usually they are the devil incarnate.
B0007TKNCY|4.0|There is one problem with this DVD. I couldn't use the programming or the repeat feature on the Sony carousel. I purchased this 2 disc special edition DVD in the Classic Comedy set.

1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is a mystery uniquely told.  The protagonist is an autistic boy who finds his neighbor's dog killed on the lawn.  As he holds the dog in sorrow, the owner finds him and accuses him of the killing.  The boy is arrested, then later released to his father when the police realize that the boy had nothing to do with the matter.  His curiosity piqued, however, the boy seeks to discover who has killed the neighbor's dog.  <br /> <br />Author Haddon is not autistic, but has worked with autistic persons, and so is very sensitive to the ways they look at the world.  Details are richly observed and often overwhelming, and normal human behavior and motivations are often completely befuddling.  Like other autistic individuals of whom I have read, the protagonist, Christopher, tries to memorize what human facial expressions mean, and learns idioms by rote.  He is also drawn to mathematics, and fascinated by patterns.  The following quote will give a representative taste of this book: <br /> <br />\\"I said that I wasn't clever.  I was just noticing how things were, and that wasn't clever.  That was just being observant.  Being clever was when you looked at how things were and used the evidence to work out something new.  Like the universe expanding or who committed a murder.  Or if you see someone's name and you give each letter a value from 1 to 26 (a=1, b=2, etc.) and you add the numbers up in your head and you find that it makes a prime number, like Jesus Christ (151), or Scooby-Doo (113), or Sherlock Holmes (163), or Doctor Watson (167). <br /> <br />\\"Mr. Jeavons asked me whether this made me feel safe, having things always in a nice order, and I said it did.\\" <br /> <br />This book provides an almost unprecedented glimpse into the mind of an autistic person, and as a result provokes thought beyond the enjoyment of an interesting and unexpected plot.  I would recommend it to readers who enjoy mysteries, and I would recommend itmost highly to anyone working in the field of psychology.  And those who enjoy mathematics will be prompted to the occasional smile, too!  <br />
0156027321|5.0|A few years ago Yann Martel read a review by John Updike on a Brazillian book entitled Max and the Cats. The book was about a jewish zookeeper in 1933 who was migrating to escape the nazi's . His ship sunk and he ended up in a lifeboat with a black panther (which represented naziism). Martell then tried to buy the book but there was no trace (Updike criticised it). Martell felt aggrieved that it was such a great idea to be poorly executed and go out of print. Anyway a few years later, in India, he realised in a moment of inspiration, how he could write a great book with it. This is Martells account of how life of Pi came to be. <br />   The book concerns a young lad of sixteen call Piscene Molitar Patel and is set in India. When the ship capsizes Pi is left on board a lifeboat with a zebra, orang utan, a hyena and a tiger. There is no doubt it is a great book. The first half of it concerns knowledge of animals. i.e. Zoomorphism and how animals behaviour can be logical if you understand it- like rhinos sharing a compound with goats etc. Also, we are told a bit about lion-taming and the animal psycology behind it. All of this non-fiction type stuff has a point, as you will find out later on in the book. What I liked was that everything seemed to have a point later on. There a gory bits and sad bits in the book and it was extremely compelling. I just loved it- I didn't know about Max and the Cats until afterwards. I'm not sure if The Booker Prize panel knew about it. But even though it's not quite as original as some obviously think (after looking at reviews) I still loved it and would recommend it.

B000AU9UYM|1.0|This movie was a bore.  The first 45 minutes was a lot of philosophy/psychology mumbo-jumbo about the journey and \\"fear is not fear if it's fear\\" or some such nonsense.  The action scenes were frenetic and hard to follow as in who was fighting whom.  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were good additions to the cast, but following the plot was like slogging through mud.  The special effects shots were good, but by the time the big-deal climactic battle arrived, I had already given up on this waste of time.  I can't believe that so many national critics gave it good reviews.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Halloween is probably one of John Carpenter's best films it has its shares of scaries within the movie!!!!! It was the feature film debut of actress Jamie Lee Curtis and i like that it was suspenseful and kept us people going through the whole movie!!!! The story is about a madman by the name of Michael Myers which escapes from a mental asylum and is on a killing spree looking for his sister Jamie Lee Curtis!!!!!! This movie is always going to be a classic horror flick period!!!

B00005JNTX|5.0|With any kind of movie, no matter how good the story is, it is essentially the quality of the cast which will make or break it, and in my humble opinion, the fascinating characters of Sin City couldn't have been cast any better.  <br /> <br />Rich and unforgettable characters such as Hulk-like Marv, brought to gritty life by Mickey Rourke, or Jackie-boy carried by the intense Benicio Del Toro perfectly conveyed the dark, sinister mood that kept me riveted. <br /> <br />A huge surprise for me, was the part of Kevin, the cannibal, played by Elijah Wood. Sure, it surprised me that he was cast for the role at all, but more astonishing was that he played the part so convincingly. An actor that I until recently found difficult not to associate with a gay halfling named Frodo Baggins had broken free of that mold with simply an eerie, whackjob facial expression and a welcome muteness that lasted the entirety of the film.   <br /> <br />Indisputably the most eye-catching and gratifying scenes of the film were captured by the ladies. Oh yes, the ladies! Violent and ruthless, yet beautiful and seductive they were. 'Deadly little Miho', a slicomatic in the guise of an innocent cutie and insatiable 'valkyrie', Gail, the boss of whores, were just a few of the most captivating vixens to never leave my mind.  <br /> <br />'Not so little anymore' Nancy Callahan was simply mouth-watering to look at, and one hardly cared what came our of her mouth so long as the camera never left her. Alba, who fortunately did not have to rely wholly on her meager acting abilities (and with her looks may never have to), was in my mind most notable for her lusty bar scene.  <br /> <br />Lastly, it should be an indisputable fact that noone could have made a lesbian cop look as painfully sexy and alluring as Carla Gugino, who, from a purely libido-stimulating perspective, surely had the most worthwhile scene of the movie, and should, as far as I'm concerned, never have to put clothes on again... ever. <br />  <br />To summarize, Sin City was a superb example of what the combination of great casting and a wonderfully dirty imagination are capable of producing. Thanks so much Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, and I am in eager anticipation of more sin to come.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'll confess, I refused to make time to watch this when it was on tv because I was disappointed that the angst and drama of Buffy overcame the jocularity and playfulness it once had. I had no faith in Joss Whedon to entertain me and the tiny bit of the show I saw once made no sense. No doubt because Fox directed that the episodes be aired out of sequence. Time passed. <br /> <br />Thankfully, one night when there was 'nothing on' I settled on this. I don't remember which episode but I gave it a chance this time and within minutes I was hooked. I Tivo-ed it the next time it was on, from the beginning, and enjoyed the opening sequence. Just like that I was hooked. The characters are quirky but believable and well-developed enough that I wish there'd been more chance to show their growth. The scripts are clever and inventive, the stories are amusing but almost beside the point since what I enjoy is the way the characters interact. <br /> <br />I especially enjoyed the \\"Out of Gas\\" episode with all the back-story about the crew forming and the launch of the Serenity.  But \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\" is also great and hints at what might have happened between Mal and Inara, if FOX hadn't dropped the ball. I never caught Dark Angel either but based on what a gem I found Firefly to be, I think I'll have to give that a try, too. <br /> <br />Good special effects, a unique storyline set in a non-Trek future and this time Joss was in top form. I can't wait to get the DVD set to watch the episodes that never aired and I'm eager to see the big-screen version when Serenity opens. If you like Sci-Fi, Westerns, quirky characters and clever dialogue (or other Joss Whedon projects), you'll find something to love about Firefly.
B00005Q3TZ|3.0|Pearl Harbor, in a way, is director michael bay's Titanic ( you know romance during tragedy) but not as good. this movie has some of the most groan-inducing dialogue i have ever heard and the whole love triangle between affleck, beckinsale and hartnett was ridiculous and the ending could have been better. Michael Bay should have shifted the movie's focus from those 3 and put it on cuba gooding's character since he played a real life hero from the aftermath so the movie could have been a biopic instead of a crappy romance saga. so you're probably wondering why i bought this film in the 1st place and i'll tell you why. Simply because i am a fan of the director, the visuals are breathtaking (Hawaii never looked so good), and the Pearl Harbor bombing scene is an excellent workout for your surround sound system. You see folks that's the beauty of DVD technology....it can make 100% complete crap look like 100% complete GOLD!!!

B00080ZG10|4.0|...and when you're poor, NUTS.<br /><br />This is a nice film, one of Scorsese's better films in the last decade.  There is a strong cast anchored by DiCaprio (best performance since \\"The Basketball Diaries\\"), Cate Blanchett, and Kate Beckinsale, and the script and cinematography are very competent.<br /><br />Unfortunately a lot of this film was centered around Hughes' obsessive drive and \\"can-do\\" recklessness, I would've liked to see a little more exploration of the childhood roots of his adult-life psychoses.  All we get is a somewhat Oedipal scene of a naked 5 year old Hughes being bathed by his batty mother who keeps talking about germs while sponging his body with slow lingering hands and eyes.  Instead the film largely centers around the typical \\"mad genius/industrialist who beats the odds and does it his way, goshdarnit\\" side of Hughes: quintessentially American, ego-worshipping stuff we've seen about a million times  already.<br /><br />Along with the lack of psychological insight, this film also does not ever delve into social and economic class issues other than  during Hughes' run-in with the Hepburn family...again a very superficial treatment of rugged Texan industrialist against pompous East Coast preppies.<br /><br />But such is Scorsese's later work: still very competent technically, lavishly produced, but lacking the true grit, passion and incisiveness of his earlier films such as \\"Taxi Driver\\" and \\"Raging Bull\\" or even \\"Goodfellas.\\"<br /><br />Guess that's why none of those films ever won an Oscar, and this one did.

B000005Z0G|5.0|Two years after his debut album (2Pacalypse Now) Tupac dropped his sophomore effort, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z., in February of '93. Although lacking some of the shine he had on his first effort, often the case among rappers, 2Pac had produced another classic. Sadly, this would be his last album in which is he would touch political issues on such a deep level. <br /> <br />A more hear-felt production than his first, Shakur wastes no time in pouring his blood, sweat, and tears into the album. On \\"Holler If Ya Hear Me\\", the disc's first track, 2Pac calls all black youth to step up and fight back against its opposition. Meanwhile, tracks like \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\" - his tribute to women, often objectified by the hip hop industry - show 2Pac's softer, caring side. \\"Papa'z Song\\" is all about a young male wanting and finally finding his father later in life, but being filled with rage and resentment towrads him as opposed to love and happiness. Tracks like \\"I Get Around\\" catapulted 2Pac into the mainstream via radio while efforts like \\"Representin' 93\\" have no real meaning but are outstanding listens and great to look back on years later. \\"Last Wordz\\" features Ice Cube, no doubt a rapper who influend a young Tupac while pairing two very controversial MCs together, while \\"5 Deadly Venom\\", \\"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.\\", and \\"Peep Game\\" all feature some prominant guest appearances. A great album that I would recomment to all rap fans. Another 2Pac Classic and a well deserved 5 stars. <br /> <br />My Top 5 Tracks: <br /> <br />1. Keep Ya Head Up <br />2. Representin' 93 <br />3. Holler If Ya Hear Me <br />4. Papa'z Song  <br />5. Last Wordz <br /> <br />Tracks I Just Wasn't Feelin': <br /> <br />I Get Around, Strugglin', Souljah's Revenge.
0780020685|5.0|Seven Samurai is a very memorable movie, but not because it's one of the best movies ever done.  It has real negatives, and I'll focus on those, as most reviewers concentrate on the positives (of which, there are many).  First, of course, are the subtitles.  I'd rather not watch any movie with subtitles.  And I'm not a big fan of the history of cinema, or particularly interested in other technical details about the movie or director.  For the most part, I just want to be entertained.   <br /> <br />Seven Samurai is a long movie, especially for one that is subtitled (it's nearly 3.5h long).  The quality of the musical performance for the soundtrack, especially early in the movie, verges on horrendous (well, it has to be the worst I've heard in a top-ranked movie) and is quite distracting.  And this is an older b&w movie that is not bettered (as some are) by being b&w.  Then again, dubbing would be disastrous, and color was not really an option.  Kurosawa drives the movie with tight, concise dialog, so the subtitling is never bothersome.   And there is enough energy and novelty in the movie to make the length endurable (even if one wishes it had been shortened a bit).   <br /> <br />I found some of the acting to be over the top.  Much of the humor has a real slap stick quality, which in this movie becomes quite endearing.  A primary story line involving a young samurai and peasant girl is at times predictable, but finishes with much to say.  Some of the battle scenes at the farmer village have credibility problems (e.g., what happened to the bow and arrows?). <br /> <br />All that said then, what makes this movie so highly rated, and worth watching for the casual modern viewer?  Seven Samurai is, in my opinion, overrated (perhaps belonging in the top 50, but not the top 10), but is still more than worth watching because of its uniqueness, especially with its portrayal of medieval Japanese society and many distinct characters.  This is very much a movie you will remember, and will enjoy on repeat viewings (a major criterion of any great movie).  For all of Seven Samarai's flaws, it has a very strong story and characters, and Kurosawa's direction gives it the energy to win over even the most critical among us. <br />

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|A comic book treatment of a great tale and profound philosophical treatise for the age in which it found voice. Alexander the Great carried a copy with him always and read from it almost daily it is said. Look no further....Brad Pitt for Zeus' sake! Achilles is an insolent punk who is tedious and unconvincing. Warriors of that time were lean and athletic. Brad was simply pumped up and bicepted to a degree. Silly! His armor looked that of a super hero. The support cast was good with the possible exception of O'Toole who languished in prosaic charactor acting. All in all the movie was a light, sometimes interesting, often goofy, badly costumed, contemporary diversion. Homer would have been mildly amused or more likely, completely horrified.

B0006B2A2E|1.0|Some people go with this sort of thing because it's hip or trendy. Pretty good ensemble and fashionable idea with an attempt to immitate creativity. The awkward sequencing, irrelevant score, self indulgent direction, shallow script hoping for depth, disturbing pokes at humor, and an abundance of pointless additives, leaves this film off beat and out of tune. Nothing to laugh about, cry about, think about..... I wouldn't have such a distaste for this movie if all the nonsense was removed, and we might be left with a mildly diverting short film.
B000AL730O|1.0|This CD is terrible. <br />There, I've said it. <br />I know that mostly McCartney fans will be coming here to purchase this CD and hopefully see positive reviews. <br />But I can't do it. <br />Oh, don't get me wrong. I AM a longtime McCartney fan. <br />But nothing on this compilation \\"grabbed me\\" at first listen. <br />So, I figured I'd give it a chance and listen to it over and over and over again in my car. Maybe, just maybe, it would grow on me. <br />It didn't. <br />Oh sure, there are a few tracks (Jenny Wren & English Tea to name two) that aren't TOO bad, but I can honestly say that NONE of these tracks will become classics that you'll want to hear him sing again in the future. And if the start of AT THE MERCY doesn't make you just want to reach for that skip button on the player, nothing will. <br />Granted, Sir Paul can't just go around singing oldies during his live concerts, but come on Paul, how about a song or two with some energy behind it? <br />And if this is the kind of stuff his \\"special guest producer\\" (Nigel Godrich) creates, I can honestly say that Sir George Martin has more talent in his little finger than this guy does in his entire body! <br />It's kind of sad when the short little musical ditties at the end of the CD (after a long pause once ANYWAY completes) catch your attention more than the regular tracks do when first listening to the disc! <br />I gave the CD a chance. I finally had to remove it from my car CD player and bring it in to place it on the shelf indoors where it will no doubt just sit unplayed for years to come. <br />This definitely was money not well spent.
B00005JN2Z|2.0|Some of these reviewers speak of this drival as if it's art of some sort. It's not!!!! Hollywood Tom through and through. Media propaganda perpetuating the pro war mentality. I would imagine that most of the guys who liked this film also think W is tuff. So we have the usual pretense of depth or meaning sprinkled on top of yet another dark tribute to violence as some valid expression of human creativity...sick. Yes, so I watched it. Really though folks, when you get right down to it - a polished turdorama. Ooooh, style...ooooh Cruise....too cool, yep too cool....yuk!
B000AL730O|4.0|\\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard.\\" Odd little album title, isn't it?  <br /> <br />So what's Paul McCartney up to on this, his 20th solo venture since the breakup of The Beatles 35 years ago?  <br /> <br />Plenty.  <br /> <br />But before we get into that, let's get back to that album title. \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" represents a pairing of lyric snippets from two of the more upbeat tracks on the album, Fine Line (\\"There''s a long way between chaos and creation\\") and Promise to You Girl (\\"Looking through the backyard of my life\\"). Gracing the album's cover is a black-and-white photograph of a teenaged Paul playing guitar amid linens hanging out to dry in the backyard of his boyhood home.  <br /> <br />So the 63-year-old McCartney is looking back on this one. But what of \\"chaos and creation\\"?  <br /> <br />Let's remember that Paul, along with songwriting partner John Lennon, headed up the band that created two of the most successful concept albums of the 20th century, \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\" Nigel Godrich, the producer of Paul's latest, helmed the controls for Radiohead's \\"OK Computer,\\" the first great concept album of the 21st century, released 3 years ahead of time.  <br /> <br />Might \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" be another concept album from Paul, his first since \\"Band on the Run,\\" the rocking post-Beatles opus recorded with his band Wings in 1973?  <br /> <br />You betcha. \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" is the usually cheerful Paul's war with the Dark Side, both as it has affected him personally and as it pervades many things perceived as \\"edgy\\" in 2005--the romanticization of violence and degradation of women by everyone from clever rappers to Islamic jihadists; the humiliation component of reality TV; the breakdown in civil discourse, and on and on... It is also the most powerful, cohesive and mature artistic statement to come from McCartney since he was a Beatle. <br /> <br />In Fine Line, the album's energetic opener, Paul lays out his case for moral clarity in a world that has obliterated boundaries. There are consequences for the decisions we make. Following the rabble is not what true creativity is about. You can take care of yourself and love and respect others AND be edgy in your ideas--indeed, fresh sounds rooted in the McCartney legacy abound on the album, presented by a one-man Paul band, occasionally assisted by strings. But you have to know where to draw the line \\"between recklessness and courage.\\"  <br /> <br />The dual themes of chaos and creation and loss and redemption recur throughout the album. In How Kind of You, a restlessly plaintive thank-you note, Paul sings, \\"I won't forget how unafraid you were that long dark night.\\" In the Dickensian Jenny Wren, the wounded protagonist will sing again only \\"when this broken world mends its foolish ways.\\" In At the Mercy, a chilling rendering of helplessness before forces beyond our control, he intones, \\"At the mercy of a busy road we can watch the universe explode.\\"  <br /> <br />Moments of romance and good cheer appear to provide relief from the album's unsettling dynamic. A Certain Softness, a flamenco-tinged love song, sounds like it could have been played at Rick's Place. Friends to Go is perhaps the world's first pop song to show compassion for a misanthrope. The stately English Tea, a \\"very twee\\" poke at England's landed gentry (and thus at McCartney himself), sounds like it came from the White Album sessions. <br /> <br />But soon the tension returns. On Riding to Vanity Fair, Paul bitterly kisses off an uncaring friend. The tug between darkness and light colors even the album's two closing power ballads, This Never Happened Before and Anyway. It's as if McCartney is saying, as we give and receive love and grace, we must remain on our guard. The darkness  always lurks close by. Pretty heavy stuff coming from that aging, cheery fellow affectionately known to his fans as \\"Macca.\\" And not a moment too soon.
B00001U0E1|5.0|A lot of people believe that Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan should have won best picture during the year Shakespeare in Love won the trophy. I disagree. Although Saving Private Ryan is a technocally accomplished film, its not a refreshing experience as watching Shakespeare in Love. And the performances are great, everyone here is top-notch, from Gwyneth Platrow to Dame Judy Dench and even Ben Affleck, who gave a better performance in a supporting role than most of his leading roles. This is a story-driven film with rich characters and a satisfying ending. Highly recommended for every film fan.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I just bought this album, and I must say WOW...It's not about every song being perfect, however with The Emancipation of Mimi\\"  it's pretty darn close.\\"THIS GIRL HITS EVERY NOTE POSSIBLE AND THEN SOME\\" Mariah is a trailblazer and has been for over 10 years..She is not trying to keep up with current R&B artists such as Amerie, Alicia Keys, and Beyonce, yet she inspires them..We Belong Together is the song of the decade and its mass cross appeal airplay is unprecedented, so that explains the 14 weeks atop the charts. The next single Shake It Off is now ruling the airwaves. and a re-release, yes I said RE-RELEASE is coming out Nov. 15...The 4th single is rumored to be \\"Don't Forget About Us\\"..
B000000OQF|5.0|what is wrong with people like MR. FRED SMITH who believes this album blows and that they are a creed ripoff?? hello FRED creed came out 15 years after GNR. anyone who thinks Justin Timberlake has the best album of all times not only should'nt be allowed to review anything EVER. they should also not be aloud to breath the same air as rockers everywhere. FRED and all of you other fakes out their i got a good album for you its called George Micheals greatest hits!!!!
B000099T2L|4.0|First of all I just want to say that this album was very beautiful it put a lot of her feelings and emotions in it and it was very lovely. The songs on this album that I liked is: Crazy in love, Naughty Girl, Be with you, Me,myself and I, Yes, Signs, Thats how u like it,The closer I get 2 you,Dangerously in love, and Daddy. Ive really respect Beyonce as in artist because she is strong ,bold, and beautiful and with a powerful voice. The most beautiful song on this album was Dangerously in love and Yes those songs just made me came 2 myself and made me think about being dangerously in love with someone. P.s. I just cant wait until she comes out with another solo album.
B00005AQE8|4.0|All eyez on me combines the old school tupac with the Gangsta style he was heading in before his shooting. This was the album that made him a star and its no concidence it was produced under the DeathRow Label. Their are many classic songs here, but its they style in which his radio hits and street songs mesh so well that give this album its power. The featured guests(Snoop doggy dogg, method man, redman and dre) churn out some of their best performances ever, and have alot to do with the significance this album still plays today. Pacs style was so versatile and his legendary status was confirmed with this album.
B00004RIVF|5.0|FUKK..this is a SMOKER!!! <br /> <br />I dont know how you cant own this??? well I see how as every other band from the AREA is talked about except these guys!! and that should change now they are back and recording new tunes!! <br /> <br />THIS IS BEYOND WORDS!!THE SOLOS!!!!!! yeah the solos can be like 3 minutes long in some parts!! these guys were easilly some of the most over looked guitar players! <br />ALL HAIL LEE ALTUS AND DOUG PIERCY!!!  <br /> <br />And of course evrey one else puts on a stunning performance as well!!Dave Godfrey is an amazing singer..he is a lot like Paul Dianno(FROM MADIEN YOU POSER!) <br /> <br />Stand out songs..ALL!!

B0007OCG4W|5.0|I saw the trailer, thought it was interesting, took a chance due to the director and cast. What I saw was a adult story about people doing stupid things in the name of love.  <br /> <br />I probably saw a different film from a lot of people but I could identify with the characters. Thankfully, I wasn't as stupid or outright ugly as these (I think, intentionally beautiful) people, but I did do some stupid things at various ages as represented here, and while I'm older than all the characters in the film, I identified with a lot of friends, ex-friends, etc. who lived their lives in a series of lies about themseles, their relationships and what happiness was. <br /> <br />In this sense Close is an adult film with some excellent writing by it's screenwriter/playwrite. The characers in general aren't all that loveable, but they aren't dispicable; just human. <br /> <br />Mike Nichols has been down this path before, particularly in \\"Carnal Knowledge\\", but also throughout his career. <br /> <br />What it comes down to is whether these characters are at all sympathetic to you, or even believeable. Perhaps it was the kind of lifestyle I lead or the people I knew, but life is full of dumb decisions and implausable reasoning. Call this adults behaving badly, or perhpas, three adults, a stunted growth damaged girl (Portnoy), a depressive (Roberts in a nice change of pace) and men being men. I know, I'm a man. <br /> <br />It seems like a good amount of people wanted a beautiful story rather than stunted growth between the sexes. The film was shot with a clinical vs warm fascade that represented the \\"warm characters\\" although as we see through the film, even the nicest guy in the film is SOB when he wants to be and his vengence is cruel, even if he's still nice enough to help his nemesis.  <br /> <br />Taken from a more adult perspective, he's just increasing his odds of making his relationship work out better. People aren't nice in Closer, nor are the pure evil. In fact, the least likeable character for me ended up getting some questionable pity from me. <br /> <br />The acting is excellent, that's why it got considerations, not because of the big name cast, because there was a script of extremely well written prose being acted effectively by the actors and stewarded by Mike Nichols. <br /> <br />This isn't typically a film I'd bother with, but I'm glad I saw it. All I can say is depending who you are, what you've experienced and whether you have spent enough time on this earth to have spent time with people like this, will help to some degree whether you like this film. <br /> <br />Forget it if you need action and adventure, this is a nicely told story that happens over years of time and does so using smart writing and film editing and director's work. I think a lot of people who found this not unrealistic or unsympathetic or any of the given reasons why people hate this perfectly fine film. Of course there are the sartorial, look at me, I'm sartorial! types here that find the film shallow or decadent or whatever. Guess what, there are shallow, decadent or whatever people in this world and some of them may become someone you love or find beautiful. <br /> <br />Woody Allen's \\"Anything Else\\" had a somewhat similar outlook but was funny and had similarly nice performances by it's cast, particularly an older Allen as a nutball acting his age. But if anyone wants to look at odd, beautiful people, have a look at Allen's playbook of lovers and his questionable decisions that were not incest but were the next best thing. <br /> <br />He's intellectually interesting to women, ask some people who saw films by him when he was in his 30s and 40s. They all had a crush on the nebbish commedian with loveable faults. <br /> <br />Maybe that would have been an interesting way of playing the film, but it probably wouldn't have gotten made or gotten an audience. I actually liked the theme of moderate to extrememly damaged humans that were close to each other and very much perfect in cultural eyes, but maybe I'm reading more depth into Closer than was intended, though I don't think so. <br /> <br />A good quality, well written and acted film adult film is made and somehow that's a terrible thing to some here. To people that enjoy film as much as reading, I think you'll enjoy the prose and the decently fleshed out characters found in Closer. Maybe I'm rating this a 5 out of spite to those that made it out to be terrible. I'd say it's a solid 4+ film, maybe a 4.5. See this if you haven't seen adult themes missing the actual themes claimed to be in the film. This one has the goods and is worth your support. <br /> <br />The DVD is lacking in extras and you may want to hold off for the Collectors, Special, Ultra Close edition that does have good extras, but those that feel they might have \\"gotten it\\" or liked the film better if only the director and or cast spoke about the film, I'd say, that's nice but I buy a dvd for the film, not the features. <br /> <br />I like them, but I'm pefectly happy a well crafted film as is. Maybe you will too. This is a film that depends on the ability to get into the character's heads wich is admittedly  difficult at times, but it is worth the effort and I hope more people give this good film a chance.
055357342X|3.0|After finishing this book, I can't help but wonder if Martin is getting paid for each word. Do we really need detailed description of everything (meals eaten by the characters, eg, how does that advance the story?!) And frankly, not 1/3 of the way through the book, the sex, and swearing were already getting tiresome. Yes, it's \\"realistic\\", we get it, enough already.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00008RH3L|2.0|This is a violence-prone, pretentious, and often confusing film that is neither interesting nor entertaining.  Mobsters \\"whacking\\" each other, apparently without reason--just to show themselves tough and heartless.  One expects much more, like a coherent plot, from the Coen brothers.  Fine acting, dreadful script, horrid film.
B0000027I6|4.0|First, you can read plenty of reviews regarding comparisons to Pink Floyd or other Waters' albums, so I will not spend time doing that here.  For me, this is simply a very good CD that is musically interesting, sonically fascinating and politically trite.  The latter part doesn't stop many of the songs from being wonderfully written to drive home Waters' very anti-West, anti-capitalist philosophies.  Whether you agree with him or not is irrelevant - some of the lyrics are simply too well written to get mad about, even if you do not agree with him overall.  `What God Wants', `Amused To Death', `Three Wishes' and `It's a Miracle' deliver some wonderfully sarcastic commentary that deserve thought and are musically well delivered. <br /> <br />So I highly recommend this as a good `art rock' album.  If you like Pink Floyd for their sound, you will probably like this CD, although it is a bit less polished.  (I personally prefer it to many PF works precisely because it is less polished!) <br /> <br />There is an extra added attraction, too, that may not seem to directly relate to the music or themes of the songs themselves, but which I think do just that. Sonically, there is a remarkable amount of texture, information and 'stuff' that, due to Waters' use of Q-sound technology, floats throughout the room well away from any speakers and serves to punctuate the point he is tryign to make.  Q-sound is designed to try and create a `surround sound' experience with only two speakers and this CD is a fascinating example of how well this can work.  In fact, it is smoother and more integrated than most `multi-channel' efforts. So if you have a good 2-speaker stereo system set up, and you position yourself so that you are sitting at the point of a triangle equidistant between the speakers, you will be surprised to hear things that will have you looking around the room to figure out where they are coming from.  You will not hear much of this on headphones, in your car or if your speakers are not aligned well, but with a proper speaker alignment you will hear some sonics that Waters clearly intended to be part of his creative process and does, in my opinion, make the overall CD even better.  The music is always front and center, but the things going on around provide pointed commentary and emphasis to what Waters' lyrics are trying to portray.  (One of my favorites is where Marv Albert does play-by-play for a televised war, with his voice coming from far outside the left speaker and almost above your left shoulder!)   <br /> <br />Waters is clearly passionate in what he believes and entertaining in how he delivers his `message'.   And the slightly rougher edges of this CD vs. many later PF efforts makes it easier to connect with Waters himself.  Good stuff, even while some of the `message' becomes wholly sophomoric. <br />
B0009NSE1K|5.0|I've been listening to Clutch since before \\"Transnational \\", and this may be the second best album they've released (I've got a soft spot for their old stuff!).  Go get it!
B000AL730O|4.0|Paul McCartney's new album is very good.  The music and production on the songs are especially impressive.  McCartney really did well playing the instruments and credit must go to the producer.  If there's anywhere the album fails, it's the lyrics which at times recall Paul's worst.  But for the better part of the album they are at least tolerable and sometimes quite good.  They do hold the album back from being a true classic, though.  They don't really hurt the album very much, just hold it back a bit.  I have been listening to it all week and like it more and more.  The best songs are Friends to Go, English Tea, Too Much Rain and Promise to you Girl.  The others are also good, but not quite.  Overall, a return to better days for Paul and highly recommended.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I really love this dvd concert - what beautiful, pure tone voices these women have - I have enjoyed watching it several times and have been recommending it to alot of friends.
B000002KIK|3.0|'Never Say Die!' is the end of an era, the last original Black Sabbath album featuring the singing of the incomparable Ozzy Osbourne. After the ensuing tour in the summer/fall of 1978, Oz was out and this was a good thing for both parties. Oz has had a superstar solo career and he got the better of the breakup over the long haul. 'NSD' the album released in October 1978 pretty much sounds like a last gasp from a once great band. Some fans and reviewers have complemented the diversity of some of the tracks but when I want jazz flourishes I'll listen to jazz thank you!. The title track, \\"Johnny Blade\\", \\"Junior's Eyes, and \\"Hard Road\\" are by far the best songs and are worth the purchase of this confusing record. If in olden days this was a real album and these aforementioned songs would have been the complete track listing of Side One, then Side Two would have been the side that nobody plays! It's not terrible, but not terribly interesting either. A saxophone solo on a Black Sabbath record!!! Gimme a break! Ozzy only sings three of the last five songs, not exactly going out with a bang (Bill Ward sings \\"Swinging the Chain\\", again not terrible but why???) Legend has that when Ozzy left on his first sabbathical (get it?) in 1977, the songs for this record were all written including lyrics for new singer Dave Walker. When Mr. Osbourne returned, out went Mr. Walker, the songs had to be rewritten because Ozzy refused to sing lyrics written for someone else. Toronto was the setting and the album was finished but so was Sabbath. Reunions over the next 25 years have reminded fans of the greatness of the original lineup's chemistry but 'Never Say Die' also should remind them why Osbourne, Iommi, Butler and Ward could not continue as they were.
B00006FDCD|1.0|If you compare the original Stephen King's it with the movie, you'll just find out that the movie isn't nothing but a cheap crap. The book is a masterpiece and I am reading it for the second time right now, no mind the 1039 pages of the book. The movie is a totally crap. The actors suck, the plot suck, the direction suck, everything suck. It's the most rediculous movie I'v ever seen. I hightly recommend to read the book first and then after you've read the book then watch the movie. You'll see what I mean.......
B00030590I|5.0|This mythical account of the first emperor of China, Yinzheng (259-210 BC.), who started the Qin Dynasty, and who many attempted to assassinate, is glorious in its visual poetry, its flying martial arts, and the charisma of its actors. Yinzheng's desire to conquer his six neighboring provinces and unify the country led to years of bloodshed, and in this film, there are 2 men and a woman, who are mentally powerful enough and adept in their fighting skills to go against him. Jet Li is marvelous as the Nameless one, and Maggie Cheung gorgeous as Flying Snow, but it is Tony Leung (\\"Chungking Express\\") who shines above all. A man who exudes strength and beauty in many of its forms, he is fantastic as Broken Sword. Also excellent are Chen Dao Ming as the Yinzheng, Zhang Ziyi as Moon, and Donnie Yen as Sky.<br /><br />For director/writer/producer Zhang Yimou, a master of dramas like \\"Raise the Red Lantern, \\" this was his first endeavor in the action genre, and he creates scenes that seem as though they are being sculpted, with flowing curtains and walls that tumble with ethereal grace. Christopher Doyle's cinematography of vast panoramas is a feast for the eyes, and added to this scenic banquet is a musical score by Tan Dun that is a delight, with violin solos by Itzhak Perlman. The story is also cleverly told, with various versions of the same plot presented. Satisfying on many levels, \\"Hero\\" is a stylish epic that can be seen repeatedly, with more to be gained with each viewing.<br /><br />It is interesting to compare this film with Chen Kaige's exquisite \\"The Emperor and the Assassin,\\" which tells basically the same story from an historical perspective. DVD extras include \\"Hero Defined,\\" with interviews with the filmmakers and cast, \\"Storyboards,\\" and \\"Inside the Action,\\" a conversation with Jet Li and Quentin Tarantino. Total playing time is 99 minutes.<br />\\"People give up their lives for many reasons, for friendship, for love, or an ideal...and people kill for the same reasons.\\"me reasons.\\"
B000002HO3|5.0|Big enough in the US while huge in the UK, this collection showcases (as correctly pointed out in the All Music Guide's review) the huge disparity between European and American pop music.      Teeming with intelligent, well crafted pop songs and tinged with R&B influences; a fairly comprehensive collection of Simply Red's better work.  The songs just flow into each other, from the early soulful \\"Money's Too Tight To Mention\\" to the poppy \\"The Right Thing\\" to my personal favorite \\"A New Flame\\" to the perfect  songs off \\"Stars\\" (their strongest release, in my opinion) including the glorious \\"Your Mirror\\".      The two songs off \\"Life\\" provide a nice constrast, Mick's sarcasm reigns on \\"So Beautiful\\" and shifts gears on the simple grooves of \\"Fairground\\".  I'm not a fan really of the only new track \\"Angel\\" but it's a small price to pay for an otherwise nearly perfect record.
B000088E6D|3.0|Solid performances all around and good tracks. Nothing wrong with the classics, I say. This guy is a good singer. Very good-technically. But, in all honesty, he sounds like hes trying to sound EXACTLY like Frank Sinatra. His voice is not quite his own, but more an imitation. I think he can continue to get even better, when he sings like he talks, and in his own voice. Its better to be a first rate version of yourself than a second rate carbon copy of someone else.
0553582461|4.0|Many hours have I spent, living in the land of the Six Duchies and marvelled at the manner in which the author kept her world together and mostly connected the main characters throughout.<br /><br />This book was to be the last in the series and quite frankly it was time.(Jordan take note)<br /><br />The Author took a lot of time and pages to intimately describe inate topics and people while relegating main characters to a distant,remote farewell.<br /><br />A little less time with Thick and shorter travelogue to the Island would have allowed for more space devoted to a better climax than the one we got.<br /><br />The Character of the Fool was magnificently portrayed throughout the entire series and I grew to miss him when the story evolved away from him. Reading the final chapters, I was saddened to see the ending of this huge character in a minor yet incisively quick thrust of a sharp pen.I think he deserved a better farewell.<br /><br />I will read anything that Robin Hobb writes and sincerely hope she is readying us for another fascinating journey.<br /><br />Will she be able to immerse herself in another world distictly different from the Six Dichies and Bingtown?

6305428050|4.0|I remember this movie being a lot more hilarious when I was a kid. Having watched it again recently for the first time in over a decade, I didn't find it as funny. Still, it still has a warm place in my heart.<br /><br />The story of a babysitter who takes the kids along as she heads off to pick up her panic stricken friend from a seedy bus stop and is caught up in a series of unplanned adventures, is very much an adventure. On repeat viewings, it doesn't quite hold up as much as the first time, but for those watching the first time it is a wonderfully fun rollercoaster ride where you don't know where it will end up next. Looking back, I still remember the wonderful performance of the wholesome Elisabeth Shue, and developed quite a crush. Watching it again, I can still see why I had that crush. Her character is beautiful, romantic, and caring, and you not only wish you were kissing her yourself, but you genuinely hope that her character gets her kiss. The kids are fun too.<br /><br />The DVD is in widescreen and the original Dolby Stereo soundtrack has been upgraded to Dolby Digital 5.1.<br /><br />Nostalgic Viewing.

B000002UAR|5.0|I find it amazing, to just drop in on Revolver at Amazon and see that it is, as of this writing, No. 172 in sales and in the top 20 in several locales. But maybe I shouldn't, because, quite simply, Revolver has stood the test of time as not only one of the very greatest rock albums ever made, but far more than the Byrds and Dylan the touchtone for all the rivers of power pop that followed in its wake -- there are no, say, Apples In Stereo, Big Star, Tommy Keene, New Pornographers (the list would take up the page; these were just in my head)without Revolver, and I guess I could have picked an even more popular example than them. A sea of bands, in other words. So why is this important? Well, the reason there are so many bands that mine what The Beatles wrought is relatively simple but enormously profound: It makes you feel so amazingly good to play and listen to it. Revolver, then, is a record of joy and it has not flagged in its delivery of that elusive and wondrous condition to the generations that have followed its release in, what?, 1967, or '68, who found themselves unabashadly in love with their parents' favorite band.

B00005JMAH|4.0|I was disappointed to find that this was a lot slower than the previous two films, and so far, my least favourite film, despite the fact I'm developing a serious crush on Daniel Radcliffe. He's so cute! Especially with all that messed up hair. What is it with guys with messed up hair, they look ultra cute? All the actors, especially the three main ones, have settled much better into their roles now, are more relaxed, and look like they're having fun.<br /><br />There's a lot in this film (as usual) that has been left out, in favour of making the film move quicker, which failed in my opinion. The Marauder's stuff for instance, is left behind, and is sorely missed.<br /><br />What's starting to get on my nerves (and did in the books too), is the whole \\"are-they-aren't-they\\" storylines that keep cropping up. This has been overdone everywhere, and JK doesn't do well putting it in the books. I hate guessing at stuff. I always end up wrong. Snape is also losing out, as he's not in the films as much as he is in the books, so they'd better start putting him in a LOT more. And why isn't Harry's Patronus shown as a stag? Or is that only shown later? I hated with a passion the shrunken heads (which seemed to feature quite a bit in some of the extras), JK should never have allowed them to include something which she never originally \\"invented\\", although she claims to like them. Why?! I love the timetravel stuff, it was very well done, and much better than the way it came across in the books. There's a pinch of Cinderella & very obviously, Back To The Future there.<br /><br />I didn't find the Dementors that scary, although I probably would have done if I was younger. They gave me the heebie jeebies, as did Gary Oldman, as Sirius Black, oh my God, that has to be the scariest man alive! Brrrrrrrr. Emma Thompson is unrecognisable, but barely used. I loved discovering the symbolism of the ravens & crows, as they're symbols of the Dementors.<br /><br />What was my favourite part of this whole movie? There was a few, but definitely the bit where Hermione punched Malfoy. I was jumping up & down in my seat when that happened. It's shown much better in the trailer however - there's no hesitation, it's shown she just walks straight up to him, and punches him.<br /><br />During the credits on the Marauder's Map watch for:<br /><br />Footprints that turn into paw prints.<br /><br />Footprints that chase other footprints.<br /><br />Cat prints that chase owl prints<br /><br />Extra-large footprints by Robbie Coltrane's credit<br /><br />Footprints that take special interest in the closing credits' creator<br /><br />Two pairs of footprints in a scandalous configuration in a corner turret<br /><br />Footprints that scurry away when the page covering them is lifted<br /><br />Footprints that get stuck in an alcove<br /><br />Footprints that walk into a room labeled \\"The Grindylow Lagoon,\\" then sink.<br /><br />The extras are definitely improving (apart from the shrunken heads), and we get more of an insight into the characters from the actual actors for a change. (Where the &*£@ is Alan Rickman though?) I loved all the interviews (done by British guy Johnny Vaughan), but especially Daniel's, Emma's & Rupert's. The games were hopeless as ever though - they need to buck up their ideas for the games, cos if an adult (me) can't get through them, how do they expect a child to do so? Or am I just stupid?<br /><br />Look out for Ian Brown in Hogsmeade!!!<br /><br />I'm still waiting for November 18th. Goblet of Fire better be better than this, yet again with a different director.

B00009UW0N|3.0|This movie wasn't bad. It was pretty cool but the kills were very cheesy. WHERE'S ALL THE BLOOD? Every attack was just being choked to death and no music while they were being attacked! Not a bad movie, though. It definatly wouldn't be my first choice for a horror movie, though. An ok movie.
6301640659|5.0|Very impressive performance as usual by Pacino and not over the top as he sometimes gets.  Its still an above average movie of its genre and am surprised that it got such a poor response from the gay community on its release.  In todays climate it doesnt seem homophobic at all.

B0007KTBIU|5.0|Pocahontas was, in my opinion, the last great traditional Disney animated film. I was fifteen when it came out, at the age where Disney movies soon became a thing of the past.  I was attracted to Pocahontas for a number of reasons: I had spend childhood spring breaks in Williamsburg, VA and Jamestown, I spent summers Up North running through the woods of Northern Michigan, and ever since childhood, I have been active in Native American culture and crafts: learning the Native American flute, working at powwows, teaching about Native American culture in Quebec, and giving craft demonstrations of making dreamcatchers, among other things.<br /><br />Very loosely based on the real Pocahontas (who was around eleven or twelve at the time of her encounter with John Smith), Disney's adaptation features all of the Disney prerequisites: talking animal sidekicks, a beautiful, independent heroine, flashy musical numbers, and a love story. However, Pocahontas marked a departure for Disney as well: it was the first film to deviate from the traditional animation style and the first to be based on historical events rather than fairy tales.<br /><br />To their credit, Disney put a lot of research into the Native American language and customs portrayed in the film. In one interview, the director mentions having a shaman visit the studio, in another segment, a deleted song about Powhatan wedding customs was mentioned for the amount of research. The film also features Native American actors in several roles, including Russell Means (Lakota) as Chief Powhatan, Irene Bedard (Inupiat and Cree) as Pocahontas, Gordon Tootoosis (Cree) as Kekata, and Michelle St. John (Cree) as Nakoma. After watching the bonus material, it is evident what an amazing amount of research and devotion Disney poured into this project. Yes, there are groups that attack the film as a commercial sell-out of Native American culture, but isn't it better to get kids interested in other cultures and traditions from a young age?<br /><br />Pocahontas is a wild spirit who would rather be canoeing down the river instead of talking about marriage proposals, as her father, Chief Powhatan, wants her to (Pocahontas says of her intended husband Kocoum, \\"He's so...serious\\").  Adventure comes her way when the dashing soldier John Smith and a shipload of English settlers lands at Jamestown in 1607 (which, ironically, is nowhere near as hilly or lush as the animation would have you believe).  The settlers, driven by the vile Governor Ratcliffe, are sure that the \\"savages\\" (Native Americans) have hidden the gold that is supposed to be in the New World, and are involved in a number of skirmishes with Pocahontas's tribe.<br /><br />Pocahontas meets John Smith and it is love at first sight. The two risk everything to be together, but a tragedy threatens to pull them apart. Unlike most Disney films, this one doesn't have a storybook ending (and unfortunately, was yet another victim of the detestable direct-to-video sequels with substandard animation, average songs, and a plot that basically ignored everything that happened in the original film), and was left open ended.<br /><br />Pocahontas also had one of the most mature and captivating instrumental scores, with a very sweeping, Native-American influenced backing of lush strings, cedar flute, and drums. I didn't care as much for the musical numbers, with the exception of \\"Just Around the Riverbend\\" and \\"Colors of the Wind.\\" One neat bonus is a multi-language reel of \\"Colors of the Wind\\" sung in Icelandic, Slovenian, Polish, Korean, Japanese, German, French and French-Canadian, Turkish, Arabic, and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few!<br /><br />For the 10th anniversary edition, Disney has truly outdone themselves with the sheer number of extras: a two-disc set that features new animation and a new song (\\"If I Never Knew You,\\" a duet between John Smith and Pocahontas), a multi-language reel, activities for the kids, including sing alongs, a \\"making of,\\"and original storyboards and deleted sequences with commentary by the directors, producers, and composers. The film has been completely remastered and is presented in 5.1 digital surround, and sounds better than ever.<br /><br />A truly beautiful package worthy of my favorite Disney film (and plenty to keep the kids engaged as well!).ith commentary by the directors, producers, and composers.

0609610570|4.0|This was a great book on how to integrate the mentality of how to execute into the culture of an organization.  It makes it very easy to compare your organization to what is ideal, see how you can change and highlight areas of improvement.  Over all a great buy.  It could have had more on developing leaders within a corporate setting but for critiquing an organization and learning what it takes to get to the next level it was conprehensive.
B0007M22TI|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best performaces I have ever seen. The music, the stage, the ladies were absolutely beautiful, everything was simply top notch! The singing was out of this world! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD!!!!!!!!
B00003CWLF|5.0|I'm not a movie buff nor do i collect dvd's but i thought this one was particularly worth owning.  I don't understand why so many critics  panned the film for being dull or too long.  I was totally absorbed and enjoyed every minute of the 2-1/2 hours. <br /> <br />The cinematography and production design was amazing  -- especially in light of the fact that they were not allowed to film in Thailand but had to recreate the palace and its surroundings from scratch.  Just absolutely visually stunning.   <br /> <br />I also disagree with critics about the lack of chemistry between the leads.  I thought there was plenty - maybe more of an intellectual nature than a physical one perhaps.   <br />Chow Yun Fat has such a strong screen presence - definitely holding his own against Jody Foster's intense yet restrained performance.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|SOme of the most beautiful music and best singing performance I have ever heard!!!! If you enjoy beautiful celtic music this is the CD to buy!!!!
B000AL730O|5.0|I considered calling this review \\"McCartney's Most Honest and Restrained Album In A While\\" but was concerned that it may be interpreted as some sort of criticism rather than describing the two elements that make it his best in a long while.<br /><br />Several songs in this album, which offer more breadth and depth that I've listened from Paul in recent albums, showed a more introspective and unsentimental view of life. I would not call this set solemn as much as restrained, avoiding a certain indulging of his cheerful side that, in my opinion, has accounted for uneven albums in the past.<br /><br />Tunes like \\"Riding To Vanity Fair,\\" \\"Jenny Wren,\\" and \\"Anyway\\" are great examples of McCartney's extraordinary gift for tender melodies, yet manage to stop short from \\"precious Pop.\\"<br /><br />To this point, in addition to these songs being a very inspired batch, Nigel Godrich's production is a key factor. It seems, from what I read, that he was able to push back on Paul enough to reveal the best and most sincere these songs have to offer, the ones mentioned before -as well as \\"Too Much Rain\\" and \\"A Certain Softness, for the sake of additional examples.<br /><br />That's, I think, a great producer's gift, to reveal -not to create- the inner beauty of music and words, to provide the sound and mood that makes them stand out -think Rubin with Cash, or Lanois with Emmylou Harris. He did not make this album better, perhaps, but as great as it should be.<br /><br />So, for me, there is enough natural beauty and thoughtful craft in \\"Chaos And Creation In The Backyard,\\" to give it album five stars.
0765309408|5.0|John Scalzi has produced a novel that, like Robert Buettner's \\"Orphanage\\" books, is indebted to Heinlein and Haldeman, but in this book, he creates a new world to shake out the ideas from \\"Starship Troopers\\" and \\"The Forever War\\" and see how they land in a new pile. <br />This is a terrific book. You know you have a great book when a best-selling author recommends it to you, as Eric Flint did to me with \\"Old Man's War.\\" It was worth the recommendation, and well worth the read.  <br /> <br />I understand a sequel is in the works, and I am waiting, rather impatiently, to read it. <br /> <br />Why are you still reading this?

0385513755|2.0|This is a magnificent book.  My only complaint is its size, due to wonderful pictures.  This makes it difficult for this semi-invalid to read.  But is so interesting, that I will manage somehow!
0802130208|3.0|Count me as another reader who, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, determined to re-read Confederacy of Dunces for its setting in the city of New Orleans.  This was a return trip for me, having first read CoD back in the early 80s.  In the time since, I've been able to visit the city several times; those memories and the state of NOLA post-disaster made the depictions of Magazine Street and the Quarter and the Riverfront more poignant.   <br /> <br />But more than that, the post-disaster scenes of New Orleans have affected my experience of the book this time around; the broken-down neighborhoods and weary slums didn't seem so cheerily cartoonish this time.  Jones working for 'minimal wage' wasn't quite so funny and the scenes in the Levy Pants factory with its sorry conditions seemed darker and more desperate than amusing.  Yes, the novel is meant to be a rollicking farce and it has its guffaw moments, but it's no longer the hilarious corker that kept me laughing page after page at the first reading.  I guess, 20 years later, neither I or New Orleans are the same as we were back then.
B000AE8FZS|4.0|While Gentle Giant's eighth studio album, \\"Interview\\" can't quite boast the consistency of the band's previous album, \\"Free Hand\\", it does have some of Gentle Giant's best work.  \\"Another Show\\", \\"Empty City\\", \\"I Lost My Head\\" and the title track are songs that no Gentle Giant fan should be without and the live version of \\"Interview\\" included as a bonus track, while rough in sound quality, has an urgency that it lost on the studio version and helps make this set an essential purchase.  Also, DRT has corrected the mastering error that was on the first version of this CD from a few months ago so if you've been waiting to purchase \\"Interview\\", now is the time because they've got it right this time.  This is the BEST version of this album on CD with a punch & clarity that previous edtions didn't have.
B000BB1MIC|1.0|This is it. I enjoyed this show up to this point, but I'm at my limit. What happened, anyway? This show used to be a cute, funny \\"dramedy\\" that managed to stay rooted in reality despite somewhat far-fetched characters and plotlines. Now, it's all over the place. I can understand that characters need to mature over the course of a show, but Rory's personality change is ridiculous. Suddenly, she's no longer a serious academic, but instead wants to drop out of college, break the law, and sleep around. Meanwhile, several promising storylines go nowhere. Dean has returned, yes, but he's now a scruffy jerk. Luke and Lorelai finally get together, yes, but they sleep together after one date, ruining tons of potential. The list goes on and on. Plus, every episode now includes at least 15 minutes of uninterrupted, near-unintelligible, \\"funny\\" banter and/or diatribes. The plotlines have become ridiculous, in a failed attempt to be satirical. Once I saw the episode where Dean and Luke get into fisticuffs over a freakin' Bop-It, I was done. And if you respect yourself, you should be done too.
6304288433|4.0|Michael Myers continues his rampage on Halloween, 1978, as he makes his way to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital where Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is being taken care of and knows, by instinct, he is coming for her. Sensational sequel to the classic horror film is equally as scary, and even a bit darker and violent than its predecessor. Once again, performances are top-notch, screenplay is excellent, music is adapted from the original score for synth and is terrifying, and the direction by Rick Rosenthal is terrific. Possibly the best horror movie sequel ever made, HALLOWEEN II's star rating is brought down to a four because of an unnecessary slow pace at times. But it is hardly noticeable because the rest of the film is so scary and great.
B0009UC7H0|1.0|Sitting through this film is like having all my teeth pulled out. Why would they make a film of pure action with a very little storyline. The desert scenes wants to put you to sleep. So it was extremely boring including the action scenes. Plus it made no sense at all, very incoherent. Don't waste your money, trust me.
B0000039LE|5.0|The one that started it all! Michael Myers escapes from a mental hospital and returns to his hometown and begins slicing and dicing his way through several people, while his former doctor tries to track him down. John Carpenter's masterpiece is one hell of a roller-coaster ride. For starters, the acting (especially from Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence) is sensational. As well, Carpenter's direction, atmosphere and music are fantastic, and the screenplay which was written by him and Debra Hill is riveting. For me, this is the absolute best in horror, and it is a perfect horror film. Scary, suspenseful and intelligent. Hands down, 5 stars.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|in my opinion this is the best dvd version of this movie because it comes in the original full screen aspect ratio it was filmed in and the book of the dead edition does not even have that, great movie for the exorcist and zombie fans
B000AL730O|1.0|I went and bought this album because of all the 5 star ratings and got it home and found it abysmal.  The lyrics are trite and undeveloped, the music is just rehash and too short- Paul raids his whole catolog of songs to rip off of and it's just more of the same- I've listened to it more than once and it's just garbage.  I prefer \\"Driving Rain\\" better than this, at least it had some rockers on it- this is just hospital waiting room music- some of it is just pure torture.  I'm going to have to trade this CD now and I hope I can get something out of it.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Coldplay is the Oasis of the 2000's: A cocky British band who strut around like they own the place, and who are subject to massive amounts of overhype from the British music press. \\"X·Y\\" is no better than their bland, derivative 2002 disc \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\". On here, they've replaced the U2/Radiohead rip-offs with imitation shoegaze-style production, by making all the instruments  slightly blend into one another to make a blurry \\"sea of sound\\" effect. It doesn't really change the fact that the music isn't all that great.<br /><br />Much like Simple Plan's lead singer, Pierre Bouvier, many of the lyrics written by Coldplay leading man Chris Martin seem to have only been written to gain more fans by \\"being able to relate to them\\", specifically the line in \\"Fix You\\": 'Tears start streaming down your face, when you lose something you cannot replace'...Is this (in addition to being so bland and inoffensive) why their fanbase is so ridiculously huge? Because I'm getting a bit tired of this nonsense.<br /><br />Has Coldplay ever actually written a \\"rock\\" song? Everything I've heard by them seems to be the same thing: A soft, mellow, \\"pretty\\" song with \\"earnest\\" vocals. Sure, I listen to bands that aren't necessarily known for \\"rocking out\\" (Slowdive, Low), but unlike those 2 bands, Coldplay doesn't have the sheer gorgeous-ness to make it acceptable. When you make one soft song after another, it makes the entire album really boring. And \\"X·Y\\" is proof. I'm not saying they have to be Slayer or Meshuggah or anything, but something a little louder and more aggressive would work wonders for these guys.<br /><br />I've always WANTED to like Coldplay after hearing \\"In My Place\\" (which is admittedly an awesome song) 2½ years ago, but aside from that, nothing I've heard by them has impressed me that much. Sure, they're not exactly \\"terrible\\", and some of their melodies are really nice, but all in all, they sound like the end result of dumbing down every moderately successful British band of the last 20 years, and that is NOT a good thing.<br /><br />There is no reason to listen to Coldplay if you have the following albums:<br /><br />\\"The Joshua Tree\\" -U2<br />\\"Revolver\\"- The Beatles<br />\\"The Bends\\"- Radiohead<br />\\"Urban Hymns\\"- The Verve<br />\\"( )\\"- Sigur Roslast 20 years, and that is NOT a good thing.

B00015TOCY|5.0|Wonderfully expressive and totally unconcerned with the concurrent musical output of its peers, this sounds as fresh now as it did decades ago.  Listening to this record has always left me musically sated and somehow cheered in the chaotic face of daily events.  A great place to start exploring Eno's music if you're new to it.  Accessible pop/rock with some truly twisted, almost creepy moments that effortlessly mesh with a musical vocabulary culled from all over the world. <br /> <br />

B00080ZG10|5.0|Martin Scorsese makes his finest film since Goodfellas.  Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance of his young career as the ecentric moviemaker/aviation genious.  I've also learned that Hughes suffered from Obsessive/Compulsive disorder, Anti-Social Anxiety, Depression and he was a Racist (See the beginning of the film.).  Cate Blanchett plays Katherine Hepburn to the tee.  I'd like to see her play the character in other films.  It was a well deserved Oscar winning performance.  Alan Alda also gives a great performance as does Alec Baldwin.  This film is breathtaking to watch.  I recommend surroundsound.  An awesome epic!

B000669GAI|2.0|Though I have a large music collection, I so far have restricted my reviews to books.  Well, I just feel that I had to express my dismay at this Pearl Jam greatest hits compilation, so I'll break out of the mold this one time.  In large part, I'm simply echoing the sentiments of another individual several reviews down.    I was pleased with the song selection and organization of the \\"up\\" and \\"down\\" songs on separate discs.  But during the mastering process, the engineers at Sony inexcusably cranked the treble so high that the tracks are almost unbearable to listen to on any speakers outfitted with halfway decent tweeters.  It's so bad that even on my car *FM radio*, my ears hurt when a station plays the \\"rearviewmirror\\" version of a song instead of the original album release.  One of the songs that the botched mastering is most obvious on is \\"Daughter\\".  I'd rather hear fingernails across a chalkboard than the opening guitar riff on that song.    Botched masters and remasters by incompetent or inexperienced sound engineers are a common problem in the industry, particularly with hits compilations because the sound levels have to be matched between several different albums, so some digital clipping is practically inevitable.  The recent \\"The Who: The Ultimate Collection\\" by MCA is another example of seriously botched remastering.  Fortunately there are usually other compilations out there that sound better and often the remastered ones sound worse!  I can't tell you how many compilations I've replaced after reading Amazon reviews with an eye to comments about sound quality.  And it's true, there are some big differences in sound between different releases that you don't need an audiophile-level system to appreciate.  The differences are usually noticeable on even a low end stereo.    The problem here is, this is currently the only Pearl Jam hits compilation out there and if you don't want to purchase five or six separate albums, you have to accept the horrible sound quality.  If you play it loud and you're wondering where that headache is coming from, now you know.

B0007GAERG|5.0|When Mariah released \\"Vision of Love\\" in 1990, I knew that this was a woman who was going to be around for a long long time. In her day, no one could compete with her and the phenomenal success of albums like \\"Music Box\\" certainly prove this. I know she has had some bad experiences along the way which I guess would explain some of the weak songs that came out around the time when her personal problems were surfacing. Didn't a record company drop her at one stage? Boy, they must be eating crow right about now. Because this album has placed Mariah back on her throne where she belongs. I dare some of these half naked artists parading as stars to compete with Mariah. Now that she is back as the Queen of R & B at long last we can start listening to decent music. <br />This album is pure genius. I can't even say which are my favourites because the whole album is good but if I were pressed I would say \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Circles\\" & \\"I wish you knew\\" as they stand out as powerful ballads and Mariah does ballads well. Watch her eat up the Grammys next year. <br />

Bon Scott was a great musician and a greay lyrical writer and people thought it would be IMPOSSIBLE to replace him, to tell you the truth, I didnt think they could do it either, but they stood the test of time and found a great replacement in Brian Johnson and theres only ONE band that has been able to do that it that was Van Halen. This album is true because it basically told the critics and everyone who doubted them to shove it, I love this album and I strongly recommend it!
0671015206|5.0|This is a valuable book for any adult at any point to read and understand/emulate some of the habits and traits of america's wealthy. <br /> <br />Dr Stanley is easy reading, not highly technical which is why I bought it for my 20 year old
0375815260|5.0|In the typical style of Roald Dahl, this book speaks to children's sense of fairness and justice (as well their sweet tooth). By itself, it is a wonderful read for an adult as well as a child. Combined with either one or both of the movie versions, a teacher can treat their class to an enjoyable lesson on reading and how books are changed when they reach the big screen.
B000BBYMA2|5.0|Reading the summary of this movie/ book/ manga, you will probably see some dumb description about how children are put on an island and forced to kill each other. While this is true, it does not do the story justice. This is not a horror or slasher flick- it shows the terrible way human minds can bend when put in the most horrible of circumstances. [...] (It was created before the novel was brought over from Japan to the US.) You will not regret it for it is free and a very good translation.  Please keep in mind! While this is an amazing story, the movie, book, and manga are very, very different. I would suggest the book as the best of three as it is the easiest to get, cheapest, the original format, and by far the best. The movie is an absolute must-see although very hard to get in most places. The manga is (in my humble opinion) the least format. It is far more violent, sexually perverse, and offensive than the others without adding much quality or information. Also, like most manga, there are many installments (14, I think and still going) each one about [...]. Very expensive if not just read in store. (However kudos to the artist(s) for being amazing with emotion.)  There is a sequal (in movie format only) which is very good but under NO circumstances should you see it before the first. I highly recommend Battle Royale!
0553062182|5.0|There are a few books that have made a life-changing impact on me in that they brought me  greater understanding.  This book was one of them.   <br /> <br />The Highly Sensitive Person is as much about being an introvert as an HSP, and both have been a puzzle and a hardship for me throughout my life.  I've often felt like a circle trying to fit into a square peg.   <br /> <br />The relief I got from this book, and uncovering the puzzling aspects of my character trait has opened many doors for me.  In fact, I have learned to be more comfortable in my skin, have accepted that I am easily overstimulated,    <br />do not thrive in a crowd of strangers, and feel things more deeply and emotionally than many people are comfortable with. But I have also learned that  even though this trait comes with a painful price, HSPs have a rich inner world and generally are people of great depth and imagination. <br /> <br />I no longer feel like I have a character flaw and therefore am less socially awkward these days when I feel myself starting to shut down due to people overload.   In cognitive behavioral terms, changing my perception has changed my reality.   <br /> <br />Another recommended book on this theme is the Introvert Advantage  by Marti Olsen Laney.  It is a gem of a book.
1573228737|5.0|This novel is gripping, realistic, and fascinating. I loved the protagonist and found myself desperately rooting for her. Her past is gradually revealed, the readers' sympathies for her grow accordingly. We readers fall under the same spell that she does. Loved the author's metaphors about prisons and how women in that era were all imprisoned, one way or another. The denouement is chilling, painful, and brilliant. I could not put down the last 100 pages. Waters is a master....after reading the ending's twists and turns, I frantically flipped back the pages and realized that Waters had laid all the clues down perfectly. As others have noted, this is not a novel that leaves you feeling happy and light. It is a stunning work which you can only marvel at.
B0009MDPYM|2.0|In the world of \\"Constantine,\\" a lurid, bloodthirsty, stupid walk in that strange Catholic world of angels and demons, John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) has the gift of seeing said demons and angels on the earth as they apparently wage war for Earth. He's pretty tortured by it, and once, before he knew his seeing was a gift, he attempted suicide, was dead for two wags of a dog's tail, and, well, even though he lived, he's destined for hell for merely attempting a mortal sin. He's also graced with the knowledge that he's destined for hell.  The archangel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) tells him so. That's a helluva thing.  <br /> <br /> So cop Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) walks into John's life. Her twin sister was a mental patient who climbed to the top of a skyscraper and swan dove. That being a mortal sin - now she's in hell. Angela wants to go in hell herself, and has to immerse herself in a tub of cold water to do so. \\"Whatever you do,\\"  John says, \\"don't close your eyes.\\" Eventually it's John, the cop, and Gabriel vs. Satan (Peter Stormare) and the lead singer from Bush in a holy rumble. <br />  <br />Modern comic books and the movies about them are a lot more obsessed with anti-heroes - think \\"Spawn,\\" \\"Sin City,\\" \\"Blade,\\" and \\"Hellboy\\" -  than they are heroes, and \\"Constantine\\" is firmly in that category: Good may prevail, but it does so in a way that credits evil. The world's dark, sinful and malevolent, but there's guns, cigarettes, women who look like Rachel Weisz and a couple other vices, so we got a chance.
0060763280|5.0|I have read lots of books on the topic of How to Become Wealthy, etc. This one is unique because the author gives the reader, in detail, two important things: 1) Statements to say to yourself, to program your subconscious mind, and 2) Excellent, practical ways to become wealthy. One of the most helpful to me was to stay away from negative people, and especially this - try for one week not to complain, about yourself or anyone else. Believe me, even if you don't become wealthy in terms of money, you'll be a lot wealthier in terms of peace of mind and happiness! <br />Most books, unfortunately, only give you one type of information, not two. I absolutely believe that the more tools and information you get re: getting wealthy, the better off you are. If you want to get wealthy, get this book! Also - the tape is great to listen to. The author's enthusiastic style is contagious, plus you get to listen to his messages which \\"stick to you\\" even more than reading the book.
B00005JOHU|4.0|Andrew Niccol's screenplay is something of a wonder. Despite a constant voiceover I felt it communicated the film's anti-arms dealing message with wit and appropriate cynicism. It's too bad Niccol's direction doesn't execute the screenplay as smoothly as I'd hoped. There is no denying Niccol is brilliant when it comes to screenwriting; \\"The Truman Show\\" was an absolutely masterclass in screenwriting while Peter Weir was there to guide it to absolute success. But that's just it: Peter Weir directed, not Niccol. Now, I'm not sure I'm the absolute authority on Niccol's work since I haven't seen his \\"Gattaca,\\" which has a strong cult base; but with Lord of War, all of its problems stem from the direction: 1) the choppy pacing, and 2) the sometimes random interjections of certain information that wouldn't have seemed so random had they been placed differently (ie introducing the protagonist Yuri Orlov's [Nicolas Cage] future wife). Also, the acting is a bit uneven in places (mainly Jared Leto as Yuri's brother). However, Cage is excellent while the movie works both as a character study and an expose on arms dealing. Niccol chooses to make the case that arms dealing is a much bigger problem than drug running. Personally, I was convinced and I'm sure most others will be. The beauty of it all is that we are convinced while at the same time being enterained to full extent. \\"Lord of War\\" is at times a thriller and a black comedy, and it could have been a great film had it not been for the weak directing job. It's unfortuante to say but true that he may need to leave the job to Weir from here on out. I could have even seen Michael Winterbottom taking a shot at this given his success with the dystopian \\"Code 46.\\" To sum up, I recommend \\"Lord of War\\" for its screenplay, which may be among the best of the year, and for its powerful message that lingers because it simply cannot be denied.
B00006690G|5.0|Just 2 years after the release of his classic sophomore album Eminem was ready to release another one.  After I listened to this album it's obvious that Eminem has changed his image big time, he doesn't rap about taking drugs, raping women or brutally killing people.  This is easily Eminem's most mature and complete effort yet.  It is arguably a borderline classic, but I'm going to say that it's just below one and still worth a 5 star rating.  At this point Eminem was really impressing many people across the world and went on to sell 8 million copies in the U.S. <br /> <br />When the lead single, 'Without Me' was released, I was sort of impressed with it.  Once you hear the album you will realize that it's one of the weaker tracks but it's still good.  So that should really tell you that this album is definitely dope.  The skits aren't as good on this album.  The Paul skit was alright and the Steve Berman was real funny.  The intro is just a curtain raising and Eminem approaching the mic, the outro is the curtain falling with Ken Kaniff coming to the mic and rapping something gay..just changing around some words from the intro to 'Without Me.'  The production was real nice; Dr. Dre and Eminem doing all of it with a few co-producers.  My favorite beats have to be 'Soldier,' 'Say What You Say' and 'Till I Collapse.'  All the choruses are hot.  My favorite has to be 'Till I Collapse.'  The guest appearances include Dr. Dre, Obie Trice, D12 and Nate Dogg.  I was impressed with all of their parts, no weak links on the guest appearances which is always good.  No real fillers, you should enjoy every song except for the maybe the overplayed 'Without Me' and 'Cleanin Out My Closet.'  I would suggest this album to any rap fan.  Underground heads won't like this though.  It's worth your money so go out and buy it to support the most successful rap artist of all time.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Here is another case of whites in Hollywood making themselves feel like they are helping race relations by making African characters geniuses or heroes in a movie. This is a form of affirmative action that sickens me. See Ayo's _How to Rent a Negro_ for more on this mentality. How presumptuous of the Wachowskis to think that a few African hackers and dashiki-clad Zion council members, some dreadlocks and a big rave can make all the hurt go away. This trivializes the entire African-in-America experience. Meanwhile, the movie is by whites and for whites, with the African characters in secondary roles, as usual. Noble negro types, to help the white protagonists along.    I have nothing against Bill Cosby presenting literate, successful Africans, as at least that is something our youth can and should emulate, but in Matrix, it is all fantasy. How can our youth be proud of this extreme artifice?    The first Matrix was escapist fun, and Fishburne was a pleasure to watch. But Reloaded was an affront.

B00000AFDW|4.0|Kiss is my favorite band of all time and they always have some decent tracks. Some have more than others. This had a lot of songs a Kiss fan needs to know but it still had some bad ones too. This is the KISS comeback. Right now i am thanking god that they didnt do the Unmasked thing again. I have to say the first song, Psycho Circus, does great for introducing the comeback and showing you but after that it kinda drifts down. I still think the songs are good but it just isnt up to perfect. If you have the time, compare this CD to KISS album number one, KISS. The difference is big. It goes to show that KISS coped with other musics and trie to sound too new on this CD. It isnt the same KISS we all know<br /><br />1. Psycho Circus (10/10) --Greatest first song i know. It really gives you a good feel for the CD<br /><br />2. Within (9/10) --Good song but it sounds a little too much like Nu-Metal. Gene wrote it and i can see he has improved his writing by a lot.<br /><br />3. I Pledge Allegiance to the State of Rock N Roll (6/10) --The song is great right up until the chorus. The title of the song is kind of shoved into it without making any sense whatsoever. It has a good guitar solo.<br /><br />4. Into the Void (9/10)--Ace's song. Great great great. His vocals are a lot better on this track. It is a metal/rock song and it sounds perfect and shows ace is still good.<br /><br />5. We are One (10/10) --My favorite song. It sounds like the very mature KISS. Gene SImmons is singing in a soft voice in the beginning and its hard to tell that its him.<br /><br />6. You Wanted the Best (9/10) --Good song. It's good because everyone has a part in every verse. The chorus isnt great but thats alright becauseit has a good meaning.<br /><br />7. Raise Your Glasses (9/10) --Another song with a bad chorus. Usually KISS has gr4eat choruses that you want to remember. Again, the title of the song i shoved in without making sense. I still will give it credit because it has great verses.<br /><br />8. I Finally Found My Way (6/10) --Peters song. It's too lovey dovey to be a kiss song i thought. Even Beth had less emotions in it. I just thought he was trying to make a beth part 2.<br /><br />9. Dreamin (9/10) --Good song with a good chorus.<br /><br />10. Journey of1000 Years (10/10)-Second favorite song. Really good writing by Gene<br /><br />Average song rating -- 87/100 (8.7/10)eat verses. <br /> <br />8. I Finally Found My Way (6/10) --Peters song. It's too lovey dovey to be a kiss song i thought. Even Beth had less emotions in it. I just thought he was trying to make a beth part 2. <br /> <br />9. Dreamin (9/10) --Good song with a good chorus. <br /> <br />10. Journey of1000 Years (10/10)-Second favorite song. Really good writing by Gene <br /> <br />Average song rating -- 87/100 (8.7/10)

B00005JMJG|4.0|I won't even try to write something about the storyline and non linear structure of this film, since most of the reviewers have already done it. It's really very hard to summarize and piece together this movie. As a matter of fact is almost impossible to categorize it also: is this a romantic comedy? Is this a comedy at all? Is this drama? Is this a love story with a twist or a twisted love story?<br /><br />  To me this movie really is the anti-cute romantic comedy. Chances are you'll either love it or hate it. I happen to love it. A lot.<br /><br />  This film so often almost spins out of control and flies off to absurd area. Almost. But it doesn't. It never really does.<br /><br />  Jim Carrey can become someone else. Someone other than Ace Ventura, the cable guy or Lloyd. Someone other than Jim Carrey, in a nutshell. His acting is a splendid surprise. While watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking about what's wrong with moviegoers today. This is by far one of the best movies he's ever been in and the best performance to date by Jim Carrey. Yet, in terms of box office, this movie bombed, while other horrible films Carrey has ever been in became instant blockbusters. Go figure!<br /><br />  And what about Kate Winslet? Well, simply put, she truly is one of the very best actresses working today in movies.<br /><br />  If you like watching somewhat unconventional/quirky/bizarre movies that grapple with the enigmatic nature of human memory and nature, well, don't go search any further. This is the one!
0553801546|5.0|I can honestly say that through my avid years of travels through the fantasy genre, I have never encountered a more beautiful, moving, heartrending, and overall wonderful book than Fool's Fate.<br /><br />The Assassin and Tawny Man trilogies essentially ruined my life as a grad student for a month simply because they were so consuming!  I continued to peruse the books after I'd finished them, rereading favorite passages and being just as moved every time.  The characters, relationships, and interactions in these books are so skillfully crafted, I remain haunted by them.<br /><br />It is evident to me that Hobb is one of the most masterful writers in fantasy.  Well done!
B00005RFAI|5.0|This is, by far, Pink's best CD.  She expresses herself not as a \\"run of the mill\\" popstar doing what makes the most money, but what clearly is PINK.  Just read the lyrics from \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" , and you can see she is clearly expressing disdain for the \\"made for MTV and Video\\" genre. <br /> <br />I give this CD \\"2 thumbs up!\\" without reservation! <br /> <br />Goth
B000AADYRQ|3.0|The album is not bad. Couple good songs here or there. This probably is their most consistant album to date.  <br /> <br />BTW, I can't see why anyone is invoking Postal Service. Death Cab is much more, um, organic. <br /> <br />I guess the best thing this about this album is that they've kept politics out of the album. <br /> <br />We really don't need another tiresome leftwing tirade. <br /> <br />
B00004RFFS|5.0|Lavish sets, great story line, decent acting combine to make this tale an excellent vampire story! <br />Anne Rice's reworking of the vampire story is a good one. She probes the psyche of the vampire to find his weaknesses and presents them in a believeable manner. <br />This movie presents all of this in a believable manner also. Not to be missed for vampire fans!
B0006A9FMI|5.0|I must come clean, I am a huge fan of Mamoru Oshii's works. Since his early years directing Rumiko Takahashi's wonderful sitcom Urusei Yatsura, through his masterpiece Angel's Egg, to his work on the Patlabor franchise and Ghost in the Shell - I have been hooked. This is a director with rare gifts. <br /> <br />With Innocence, Oshii has created his most visually stunning work to date. The visuals are of course the star of the show, and what a show they are. Sumptuous CG work is everywhere, virtual sets springing to life in 3D and layer after layer of wonder composited over the backgrounds. Production IG, the studio behind this work, have raised the bar. The cell work is also highly accomplished, and by and large matches the CG pretty well.  Innocence is without a doubt the prettiest anime movie to date. <br /> <br />Fortunately beneath these wondrous visuals Oshii, who wrote the story for Innocence as well as handled the directorial duties, comes up with thought provoking and intelligent tale. The essence of story - that living creatures have a 'ghost' which defines who they are regardless of their current body - is, as with the first movie, the underlying motif. On top Oshii layers philosophy and wisdom in some hugely articulate dialogue, and of course delivers some fantastic action sequences too. <br /> <br />Certainly Innocence is an indulgence, for Oshii himself, for Production IG, and for Oshii fans, and so for many will be a hard work to enjoy. It lacks the immediacy of Ghost in the Shell, as this is a much deeper tale, but give it a chance, and some repeat viewings, and perceptions will change. Innocence is truly one of the finest anime movies made to date, both for it's extraordinary production values and for it's highly intelligent and well crafted storyline, which makes the poor US DVD release all the more difficult to accept. <br /> <br />Fortunately there is now an 'international' Innocence DVD available in Japan, which comes complete with English sub-titles and lovely packaging.  Innocence is a must watch, but just not with this shoddy and insulting US DVD.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|Truly original mistaken-identity thriller with unforgettable, and original scenes. From a crop-dusting plane to the faces of Mount Rushmore, Hitchcock created a timeless classic. Grant and Novak are superb in their acting here...really good casting. <br />Nothing has ever come close to this one, and I doubt it ever will.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Final Fantasy VII Advent Children is made for fans of Final Fantasy VII the video game. If you have not already finished (or even played!) the game then now is your chance to do so, as you will be lost when watching Advent Children otherwise. <br /> <br />With that out of the way we can discuss the movie, and what a tremendous piece of work it is. Square are legendary with video game fans for their exemplary CG work, and with Advent Children they have, and it's hard to believe I realise, surpassed all of their previous work to such a degree as to make it seem horribly out-dated. The artwork and design here is beyond compare, it is truly astonishing. Every scene drips with detail and attention to detail, the colour palette is subtle and beautifully balanced, and the stylised characters set new standards. <br /> <br />The direction is top notch too, if a little overly flashy at times. Action sequences are cut to a frenetic pace, and are thrilling to watch. It's clear that a vast amount of effort and talent went into creating these images. <br /> <br />Sadly the same cannot be said for the plot. J-RPG plots are often rather silly and contrived, so go in expecting that and you will at least not be surprised. What's here isn't complete gibberish, but it really doesn't make a lot of sense and in all honesty is just a pretty poor story. The dialogue serves the story well enough, and it's acted to a professional, if completely unsurprising level by the stereotypical Japanese cast. <br /> <br />Other downers are the blatant and jarring product placement of a cell phone, which pops up all over and is a very long way from discreet. The soundtrack too is a little disappointing, despite the re-appearance of a few familiar themes. The soundtrack is littered with poor attempts at rock, which like the obnoxious cell phone ads feels misplaced. <br /> <br />Still, despite it's faults Advent Children is a lot of fun to watch. There's a lot to enjoy in the stunning artwork, plenty of fan friendly things to spot, and the fight sequences will take your breath away. Just don't expect a great story.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|This was one of those rare occasions that I felt I spent time watching a movie in vain. I'm really perplexed by this movie and what point it was trying to make. <br />The only character that was believeable was the little fat girl! <br />I think that this may succeed on some college literary level where they tear the scenes apart to discuss them... but for entertainment it doesn't work.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay set the bar way high for themselves last time. Lemme start off by saying that I'm amazed that there was absolutely no break in stride after Chris' marriage to Gwyneth. It must all be going well, because this music is just beautiful. I don't listen to male vocalists very often at all. I'm a pop fan. I look for cheerful melodies only, but when the melodies are this soaring and imaginative, they don't have to be happy. Of course, my favorite song on here, \\"The Hardest Part,\\" sounds cheerful. Ordinarily, most rock albums I buy have one or two songs that, at least at the moment I buy 'em, seem to merit the purchase of the whole CD. Then, after you've played 'em to death the whole CD is just a paperweight. Not this one. \\"Speed of Sound\\" and my favorite are two great tracks, but the rest surround gracefully to create an actual full album of creativity, and the same style is kept. I strongly discourage jumping from style to style on a single album. As well, although quite mainstream to the point where you can turn on the radio and find this album playing at some time, or MP3s anywhere and everywhere, I just had to have the CD so I could listen to these at my own frequency- all the time! I mentioned that I'm not a rock fan, and I'm not even a fan of too many British acts, such as Elton John, U2, Keane (maybe a couple of songs), but this band just stands out. The synthesizing creates a radiance to each song, which are done acoustically, so there's melody AND technique. As well, being a pop fan, rock albums and groups always seem to be: In corduroy and faded jean jackets, long scraggly hair and vintage instruments, black and white music videos, and vocals that're too rough or guitar soloing that's too much of a focal point. Not this band. They've evolved, and took the whole concept of music with them. It contains what I, a pop fan looks for, but of course includes what the rest of the left-brained percieving listeners look for. BTW, I do not own their previous album(s).
B000022TSH|2.0|But... sorry. After 3 seperate viewings, I tried to find some redeeming qualities about this movie.. but alas, none I could find. <br />For film noir, I think D.O.A., either original or remake, does a much better job of showing desperate people doing desperate things. This movie plods along with a very contrived plot and almost completely flat acting by two greats... Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson. I think that may be deliberate, but doesn't do much here. <br />Sorry for those who rave about it, but I really tried.
B000089RV6|3.0|We all know the story. AC/DC released the \\"Highway To Hell\\" album in August of 1979, and it became their commercial breakthrough album in the US, reaching the top 20 and going gold before the end of the year. Then, in February of 1980, vocalist Bon Scott choked on his own vomit in his sleep and died, and the band quickly brought in Brian Johnson as their new lead vocalist.    Despite everything that the surviving members were going through at the time, AC/DC had a new album out at a startling rate. Less than a year after the release of \\"Highway To Hell\\" came its follow-up--\\"Back In Black\\"--released in July of 1980. It seems that this fast turnaround time was largely instigated by Malcolm Young's desire to keep on working, presumably as a way of working through the sadness of Bon's passing.    Unfortunately, the band clearly rushed into the studio too soon before allowing themselves enough time to build up an album's worth of quality material, and a majority of the album wallows in mediocrity. \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\", \\"Given The Dog A Bone\\", \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You\\", and \\"Have A Drink On Me\\" are all very much marred by perfunctory riffs. \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You\\" even has a devastatingly lame, cheesily-harmonized chorus and largely sounds like a reheating of the first song on the album, \\"Hells Bells\\". The chorus on \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\" is also startlingly tossed-off and uncatchy. The beginning of \\"Shake A Leg\\" sounds like a watered down rehash of the opening to \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\". \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" sounds formulaic and is desperately lacking in catchiness, plus the extended mellow section, with ludicrously unimaginative eighth-note picking from Angus, is appallingly dull.    As for \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\"... I certainly won't deny that the band's performance on this song is mind-blowingly tight, nor is it devoid of catchiness, but it's got an annoyingly smiley-faced, sugar-coated cockrock sound to it--to put it another way, it sounds way too much like Foreigner for its own good. Naturally, it became a big time hit, and in turn, played a major role in the huge success of the \\"Back In Black\\" album. And this commercial success seems to have brainwashed a huge number of music listeners into thinking this is AC/DC's best offering, when in reality, it ain't even close.    Sure, the chilling \\"Hells Bells\\" is a spellbinding classic with an unforgettable, doom-laden main riff, even though that main riff is very similar to the bridge riff on their earlier \\"Cold Hearted Man\\", and the chorus blatantly derives from Foreigner's \\"Head Games\\". There are also nice licks to be found on \\"Shake A Leg\\" and \\"Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\". And the funked-up title track has ultra-catchy guitar riffery, but even this supposedly classic tune is marred by Brian just not knowing when to shut the hell up--he simply goes way overboard with his screaming; plus, that little snippet that arrives at 2:50 of the track is blatantly derived from Aerosmith's \\"Sweet Emotion\\", which is a better tune, I might add.    Like the two surrounding albums, \\"Back In Black\\" was produced by Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, and there's no doubt that he deserves at least some of the blame for leading the boys into dull corporate rock territory, as he had also done on the previous \\"Highway To Hell\\".  The album just sounds too damn compromised and watered-down, sorely lacking the reckless abandon of AC/DC's best work--again, this points to why this album has had such big time commercial success, because of its appeal to mainstream wimps who probably wouldn't have given AC/DC the time of day otherwise.    The album really sounds forced. I mean, geez, just look at Johnson's corny, ham-fisted, awfully calculated spoken intro to \\"Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" for an example. It's as if AC/DC were still mourning Bon's death and were trying to slog through the crisis by recording despite their hearts not really being in it--it soundsas if they'd have rather been elsewhere.    So, I know this sounds pretty harsh, but it's definitely high time for a reality check with this album. It's not THAT bad or anything, and it has its moments, but it's far from a masterpiece.

One of the most memorable lines is when she proclaims... \\"I'm the babysitter!\\". <br />Not to be missed. Enjoyable for everyone. Must see classic and timeless comedy.
B000002JS6|3.0|We all know the story. AC/DC released the \\"Highway To Hell\\" album in August of 1979, and it became their commercial breakthrough album in the US, reaching the top 20 and going gold before the end of the year. Then, in February of 1980, vocalist Bon Scott choked on his own vomit in his sleep and died, and the band quickly brought in Brian Johnson as their new lead vocalist.    Despite everything that the surviving members were going through at the time, AC/DC had a new album out at a startling rate. Less than a year after the release of \\"Highway To Hell\\" came its follow-up--\\"Back In Black\\"--released in July of 1980. It seems that this fast turnaround time was largely instigated by Malcolm Young's desire to keep on working, presumably as a way of working through the sadness of Bon's passing.    Unfortunately, the band clearly rushed into the studio too soon before allowing themselves enough time to build up an album's worth of quality material, and a majority of the album wallows in mediocrity. \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\", \\"Given The Dog A Bone\\", \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You\\", and \\"Have A Drink On Me\\" are all very much marred by perfunctory riffs. \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You\\" even has a devastatingly lame, cheesily-harmonized chorus and largely sounds like a reheating of the first song on the album, \\"Hells Bells\\". The chorus on \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\" is also startlingly tossed-off and uncatchy. The beginning of \\"Shake A Leg\\" sounds like a watered down rehash of the opening to \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\". \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" sounds formulaic and is desperately lacking in catchiness, plus the extended mellow section, with ludicrously unimaginative eighth-note picking from Angus, is appallingly dull.    As for \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\"... I certainly won't deny that the band's performance on this song is mind-blowingly tight, nor is it devoid of catchiness, but it's got an annoyingly smiley-faced, sugar-coated cockrock sound to it--to put it another way, it sounds way too much like Foreigner for its own good. Naturally, it became a big time hit, and in turn, played a major role in the huge success of the \\"Back In Black\\" album. And this commercial success seems to have brainwashed a huge number of music listeners into thinking this is AC/DC's best offering, when in reality, it ain't even close.    Sure, the chilling \\"Hells Bells\\" is a spellbinding classic with an unforgettable, doom-laden main riff, even though that main riff is very similar to the bridge riff on their earlier \\"Cold Hearted Man\\", and the chorus blatantly derives from Foreigner's \\"Head Games\\".  There are also nice licks to be found on \\"Shake A Leg\\" and \\"Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\". And the funked-up title track has ultra-catchy guitar riffery, but even this supposedly classic tune is marred by Brian just not knowing when to shut the hell up--he simply goes way overboard with his screaming; plus, that little snippet that arrives at 2:50 of the track is blatantly derived from Aerosmith's \\"Sweet Emotion\\", which is a better tune, I might add.

1593072937|5.0|The first Sin City book, written and illustrated in all it's monochrome, noir glory by Frank Miller, is unquestionably one of the best Sin City novels, if not the best.  <br />The Hard Goodbye follows the story of a mega-tough thug called Marv with a face like a leather mitt and a body like a bulldozer. He had never any friends or had any girls in his life, thanks to his rough and murerous persona, but one night a beautiful hooker named Goldie finds him and does something nobody had ever done before: was kind to him.  <br />Marv wakes up in the morning and finds, to his horror, that Goldie is dead. And he swears an unbreakable oath to find her killer, and give him absolute hell in all its forms, before killing him.  <br />At that point, the story draws you into the shady backstreets of Sin City and into a labyrinth of seedy characters and brutal crimes. Miller's story burns into your brain and catches your heart with every shocking moment that jumps out at you. The art is all in black-and-white, and every line is brushed with shadows, every person carpeted in a menacing darkness that outlines their frame. Both Miller's writing and his art screams wonderful things at you as you go through every page. <br />I only have one gripe about this excellent book: about two thirds of it is just violence. The major block of the novel is a pointless bloodbath. Marv slughters anyone who crosses him in a horrific fashion with guns, axes, saws, and his fists. Sometimes you tire of the nasty stuff, and I would have given it 4.5 stars if I could have.  <br />
B000084T18|5.0|Hey... I wrote this review when I didn't have an account, and I just wanted to put it in.  Read It!  ----------------------------------------------------------------    Ok, there has always been a lot of hype around 50 cent, ever since he dropped How To Rob. That song was hott. Then he got shot and the cd was pulled from shelves and 50 was dropped from Columbia records. Now fastforward to 2003. 50 Cent releases a near classic album called Get Rich or Die Tryin'. This cd is amazing, but then again how couldn't he make an amazing cd with a team like Eminem and Dr. Dre behind you? Plus he had G Unit, a group that has mostly proven themselves to be good rappers. Anyway, the album starts off appropriatly enough, with what sounds like a coin hitting the ground. Then it goes into the tense and awesome What Up Gangsta.     2. What Up Gangsta: This song is absolutley amazing. It is one of the best songs on the whole album and it starts off the album perfectly. 10/10.     3. Patiently Waiting: Another amazing track! I love this song, and Em's verse is amazing. He spits some great lines over a beat that he produced, and it is also an awesome beat. 10/10.     4. Many Men (Wish Death): I love this song. 50 Spits some good lyrics and the beat is amazing. This is one of the best on the album. 10/10.     5. In Da Club: You've all heard it and you all love it. It is a great song with a great Dr. Dre produced beat. This song is really made for the clubs and is just awesome. 10/10.     6. High All The Time: This song is the 5 straight amazing song on the album. The beat is cool but the lyrics are great. It is funny (IMO) and interesting to hear him rap about... well... being high all the time. 10/10.     7. Heat: This song was taken off of the edited version of the cd, and for good reason. This is a very violent song but it is also a very good song. I like the lyrics, the chorus and the beat. Great Song.  The only problem with the song is the 30 seconds at the beginning with the guy talking.  I didn't like that.   9/10.     8. If I Can't: Perfect.  Catchy, great beat, and good verses.  Amazing Song. 10/10.     9. Blood Hound: I love this song, especially because Young Buck is in it. Young Buck is a great rapper and him and 50 tear this track up. Great Song. 10/10.     10. Back Down: A Ja Rule diss song and it is awesome. 10/10     11. P.I.M.P.: Originally, I didn't like this song that much, but now that I've listened to it a lot, I love the song.  Great. 10/10    12. Like My Style: I like the beat, the lyrics, and the chorus to this song. They are just awesome. 10/10.     13. Poor Lil' Rich: Same as Like My Style, only a bit better. 10/10.     14. 21 Questions: Awesome song with a great chorus from Nate Dogg and some memorable verses from 50. You can tell that he really had fun with this song when he says \\"I love you like a fat kid love cake\\". 10/10.     15. Don't Push Me: Another great song, this time with Lloyd Banks and Eminem. I like this one a lot. 10/10.     16. Gotta Make It To Heaven: This song is awesome and one of my favorites off of the whole album. The lyrics are good, the chorus is good and the beat is good. 10/10.     17-19 are all bonus cuts and they are all amazing and all get 10/10. I recommend that everyone buy this cd because it is one of the great recent rap cds and it blows the massacre out of the water. This is 50 Cent's shining moment, and it will be remembered as a Hip Hop classic, even if it misses by just a lil bit.

0375703861|1.0|Bad grammar within quotations is of course fine because garbage-can characters usually speak with bad grammar.  Yet, Smith's misplaced modifiers, mixed metaphors, and incorrect omissions of words such as the word \\"that\\" are elementary mistakes that detract from the book's legitimacy.  The writing is equivalent to that of a novice English speaker.  Instead of showing, Zadie Smith tells. In order to respect the reader's intelligence, a writer must show, not tell.  When the reader has a chance to utilize his ability to think, the plot hijacks all of his attention.  Such a book engages the reader.  Yet, when the writer gives the reader all of the answers by telling everywhere, she insults the reader's intelligence and the reader falls asleep.  Why should I read a book if I am told all the answers?  Why should I read a writer's work when the writer has already done all of the thinking for me?  For example, the nuances of a characters actions should reveal to the reader the character's feelings, the character's personality, and the reasons for the character's ways.  Zadie Smith washes away any trace of a reason that I had for wanting to pay attention to the book because she answered all of those questions in the text.  The book does not demand that the reader stay present or keep his eyes open.  Thus, the book is an eye-closer.  450 pages of the same lackluster pattern is even repulsive.  Five-star raters of this book are low-level thinkers because they like being told the answers, and I would hesitate to heed their insights.
0788821075|4.0|This is a decent fun movie in all. Kind of a \\"sleeper\\" hit when it came out, you might want to check it out, if you haven't seen it. It will especially appeal to those who have dreams of being swept away by a \\"prince charming.\\" In this case the prince is Gere, who is older, but that's seems cool (Micheal and Cathrine, Tom and Katie), and Roberts, who's hot (that's cool too). It is a \\"interesting\\" depiction of prostitution, it must be different in downtown L.A. than in my city. Here, the women on the streets are not as pretty as Julia Roberts or even her friend. As I've driven by them on my way out with friends, it's hard, difficult, impossible, to imagine some super rich billionare deciding to be with one of them. But, I guess in L.A. prostitues are all super-hot, really decent people on the inside, full of life wisdom and civility, that's just waiting to come out. There is a good extra scene of a time Gere is hasseled outside a bar by some \\"punks\\" and his driver shows off his gun and Gere tells the punks that he \\"has a permit.\\" It's a good thing he does, street punks are often really concerned with the legality of the status of the people around them and most of them are probably lawyers just waiting for Ally McBeal to come rescue them on clean them up to find they are handsome, well-spoken, honest, gentlemen, just waiting to come out and be rich and perfect for Ally, or whoever.<br />So why buy:<br />Fun movie from the past<br />New scence (well hardly any)<br />VHS tapes will be a good relic for showing your grandkids<br />Good scene about hostile takeovers for quickly showing your Economics class<br />Julia/Richard are good looking people you can romanticize (if you're into that type of person/thing)<br />It's inexpensive<br />You might want to teach you children that money and wealth are sexy and cool, and the power that comes with them is important.<br /><br />Anyway, hoped you liked my review...?

1577314808|4.0|\\"All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the present.  Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry - all forms of fear - are caused by too much future, and not enough presence (the now).  Guilt, regret resentment grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by too much past, and not enough presence.  Most people find it difficult to believe that a state of consciousness totally free of all negativity is possible, and yet this is the liberated state to which all spiritual teachings point.

You beleive that they are caused by specific situations in your life, and seen from a conventional viewpoint, this is true, but until you have dealt -with the basic problem making dysfunction of the mind - its attachemnt to past and future and denial of the Now - problems are actually interchangeable.  If all your problems or perceived causes of suffering or unhappiness were miraculously removed for you today, but you had not become more present, more conscious, you would soon find yourself with a similar set of problems or causes of suffering, like a shadow that follows you wherever you go.

6300215717|5.0|Roman holiday is the most incredible movie I have ever seen. I came across this movie quite by chance. I like suspense movies and I watched Charade starring Audrey and Cary Grant. Audrey's acting in that movie impressed me so I decided to watch Roman holiday too. Too be very frank I was not really looking forward to watching this movie. Like most people of this generation I dislike black and white movies.    Man was I wrong. I have never seen a movie, which had so much romance, comedy and emotional drama. It would be fair to say that magic was created in this movie. The plot I guess everyone knows, a young princes tired of her regulated life runs away and hooks up with a reporter (Gregory Peck) for a day of fun in Rome. The reporter lies to her that he is a businessman and she lies to him about her true identity. They both have fun visiting Rome's historic places. But the reporter has a hidden agenda. He wants to write a story on the princess's escapades in Rome and enlists the help of his photographer friend (Albert). Things work according to plan for the reporter until he finds that he is really starting to fall in love with the princess.     The story line may appear to be simple but take my word for it that Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn create magic and the movie will take a hold over you like nothing else you have ever seen. This is Audrey's best movie and the only movie she got an Oscar for and she was never so charming, innocent and beautiful as she is in this movie.    One of the reviewers has suggested that Cary Grant would have been ideal for the role that Gregory Peck plays. I only have to say this to the devotees of Cary Grant that he would never have worked as a romantic lead in this movie. He was 50 years old at the time this movie was made and the sight of him cavorting around with a girl half his age would have shorn the movie of it romantic element. It would have become perhaps a slightly funnier movie but without the heart wrenching almost magical hold it now has. Also it is my humble opinion after seeing Charade that Cary Grant is too suave to play the role of a struggling reporter convincingly.     History has already spoken; this movie is regarded as one of the all time greats, why would we want to change something, which is already perfect. Gregory Peck is ideal for the role of the reporter, he is incredibly handsome in the movie, a kind of man a young girl could fall in love with even after being with him only for a few hours. In this movie, Gregory Peck acts his heart out, especially at the end and he has a wonderfully chemistry with Audrey, which is the reason this movie still seems so fresh and charming even after 50 years.    This is one of those rare movies that works across cultural and national borders. I was surprised to learn that according to a poll in Japan even after so many years Roman Holiday still is the number one foreign movie of all time.    This movie is simply the best.

0783114893|3.0|I've seen hundreds of Sci Fi movies over the years.  This is one of those you'll wonder whether you've watched it or not a few years down the road.  You just can't remember.<br /><br />All in all, I figure it's still better to watch a so-so Sci Fi movie than \\"Dances With Wolves\\" or \\"Evita\\".  This movie will end up being non-memorable, but it's preferable to being in a coma.
B0002IU988|4.0|If you liked Creeds style of music then you should like Alter Bridge. Creed was very popular in its day, but perhaps it was more so because of the exposure through airplay it got for its most commercially viable songs like Arms Wide open, Higher and My Sacrifice. The thing is with Creed, their most melodic songs, were perhaps what made them popular and recognised as musicians and songwriters. But although Creed are one of my favourite bands, there are few too many memorable songs on their albums.  <br /> <br />This is where Alter Bridge improves on what I personally liked about Creed. <br /> <br />Its got those heavy guitar driven riffs but the vocal melodies have much more variety adding a greater sense of memorablility for the listener. In Creed, Stapps vocals are dark and brooding and his limitations are evident as he strains in the upper registers. Mayfield seems to soar with ease yet still growl with angst as in the verses of Metalingus. It is here that the greatest progression from Creed can be made. Mayfields singing range is so much more versatile adding a greater complexity and accomplishment to each track. Lyrically though, whilst the inspiration is no doubt as personal and meanigful, the lyrics do seem a bit more benign. <br /> <br />And Tremonti?....well it seems the reigns have been let out somewhat. Chunky bottom end ryhthms interlaced with some fine fretboard shredding highlight his talent that in retrospect seemed to have been held back on the Creed albums. <br /> <br />Overall, Alter Bridge's debut album is much more accomplished than Creeds last Weathered Album. Generally, whatever you liked about Creed's music is present in Alter Bridge, except better. <br /> <br />Probably going to be one of favourite albums for a while.

It's a good thing the story is fantastic.<br /><br />Can't wait to see the movie Serenity!
B000002UAR|5.0|It's surprising how little you hear about Revolver from everyday Beatles fans. Around the same time era, it's just as good, if not better than Sgt. Pepper's.  <br />      <br />     The first song, Taxman, is not my favorite George (Here Comes The Sun), but it is a good one, and I couldn't think of a better song to start off Revlolver with.  <br /> <br />     The second song, Eleanor Rigby, is probably the second biggest hit from the album. Short, simple, and sad. <br /> <br />      Third: I'm only sleeping. It's a creative song. It's different, not something you hear everyday, but John's had much better. <br /> <br />     Fourth: Love you To. Not my favorite. But not bad. One of Harrison's Indian songs. George, George, George. <br /> <br />     Fifth: Here, There, and Everywhere. Pretty good. Takes the album down to a softer level from Taxman and Eleanor Rigby. Very melodic, pleasent, easy song to listen to. <br /> <br />     Six: Yellow Submarine. Very good. Who doesn't like Yellow Submarine? Pretty easy to catch the lyrics. Haha. <br /> <br />     Seven: She said, She Said: Not the best. Hard to describe actually.  <br /> <br />     Eight: Good Day Sunshine. One of the best on Revlolver. Catchy, happy tune. The opening is good, with the piano and then drum sequence. <br /> <br />     Nine: And Your Bird Can Sing. Hands down, the best song on the album, or atleast my favorite. Best opening of a song on Revolver. Very, thoughtfull song. I heard a story that this song was about Mick Jagger's bird actually. But it doesn't really matter what it's about, this is a great song, that doesn's push itself to be longer than necessary, just the right length. <br /> <br />     Ten: For No One. I don't see anyway you would have heard this song if you didn't hear it from Revolver. Underrated, and (and under spoken for that matter). Short, sort of sad. Very similar to Eleanor Rigby in my opinion. <br /> <br />     Eleven: Doctor Robert, my second favorite on the album. Rocking, cool opening, similar to Taxman I would say, but better. <br /> <br />     Twelve: I Want To Tell You. Edgy Piano part in the background. Not my favorite. <br /> <br />     Thirteen: Got To Get You Into My Life. Jazz instrument focus. Very good, not really similar to any other song by The Beatles or anyone else. A happy, good, Paul song. <br /> <br />     Fourteen: Tomorow Never Knows. Sort of Indian based also. It's better than some of the Indian songs, but not the best song ever. There are better songs on Revolver but it really does make a good closing song. <br /> <br />     Revolver deserves 5 stars completely. Throw away the thoughts in your head, on what you think you have to get. If you've got Sgt. Pepper's, dont get The White Album. Get Revolver.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|I know it sounds so cheesy.  A movie made me who I am today?  Well, I watched this movie when I was 12 and today I'm a Science Fiction bookseller.  It started me on my road to a love of Science Fiction.  I'd never seen a movie before that had my eyes bugging out of my head.  The scenes were so ... so above and beyond ... so out there from my little 12-year-old reality.  It had me looking forward to what could be.

B0009MDPYM|3.0|I enjoyed the special effects and they were interesting. I don't think any one understands Catholic theology anymore, especially the priests. The movie spouted theology, angelology and eschatolgy, but it doesn't really match anything I know. The plot was hard to follow and had some hard to understand plot lines, but it made some pleasantly surprising turns too. The whole \\"spear of destiny\\" idea was very confusing. The characters were very interesting.  At the start, I thought Keanu miscast, but he grew on me. I enjoyed the point the Reeves's character made about believing in the devil. The heroine says, \\"I don't believe in the devil.\\" Keanu replies, \\"That's too bad. He's believes in you.\\" The truth is the truth no matter what you believe. It doesn't prove God or satan exists, but it is something to think about.    It was fun for a spirtual thriller.

B000005GW2|5.0|This, ladies and gentlemen, may be the best vocal Jazz album I have ever heard (I say have heard because I've only listened to maybe fifteen albums in the genre). By just destroying any credentials I had in the previous statement, lets move on to the review. This is a West Coast Jazz classic, truly one of the most overlooked outputs of the Cool School of Jazz. While not as technically competant as \\"Kind of Blue\\", I manage to listen to it just as much, if not more. Every song included on this disc is a classic standard, and Baker's version of \\"My Funny Valentine\\" is the greatest version of the song, beating out Sinatra's rendition by a mile. The instrumentation itself is flawless, as Mr. Baker's trumpet playing guides the band. He was as adept at the trumpet as he was at singing. The low-key and minimalist style of the band is perfect for the songs, and is one of the best bands in Jazz history. Influential and flawless, this is a must-have for any fan of post-war Jazz.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|What a stinky... yucky... pootchie movie. I mean... ew. Really. Just... ew. It was horrible. The only reason people watch this is for... I dunno. \\"Sex appeal.\\" Do not watch it for the story line. Never buy it as a gift. Just my opinion, and a damn good one for that matter. Toodles.   *uhg* DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE THAT STAR THEY MADE ME PUT. Yeah....
B000002WPI|5.0|While not my favorite rap album (that award goes to either Tribe Called Quest's \\"Low-End Theory\\", Public Enemy's \\"It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back\\", or Beastie Boy's \\"Paul's Boutique\\"), this is by far the best example of gangsta rap I have ever heard, not to mention some of the best production ever in an album, rap or otherwise. If you like intelligent and political rhymes, you should look elsewhere. However, if you want intimadation, excellent production, or need to check out your new car stereo system, pick up this East Coast classic. In all honesty, I'd take this over \\"The Chronic\\" anyday. Every rapper makes an important contribution, and none stand out as being more talented than others. They all work well as both individual rappers and as a collective whole. The main reason why this is a classic though is the production. Minimalist without being too sparse, RZA knows where to put certain beats. The beats mesh perfectly with the rhymes, inhancing the feel of them. The only complaint I can think of for this album is the skits, but even those add to the overall atmosphere. Classic gangsta rap, a must for anyone with a fleeting interest in the genre.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|Just... just brilliant. I'm almost at a loss when I look at this movie and try to find words to describe just how wonderful it is. I have only one thing to say, really.... Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason... I like you, just as you are.
B00009P1O5|5.0|This is in Neils top 6. Who could bash this this cd?This is Neils rock and roll.Neil caught the big one and some people let it go but not me. If you don't want to crank up the stereo don't get this Neil cd.By the way. Could some of you please shorten up your review. You're not getting a grade and you are not impressing me at all. Got mashed potatoes!!!<br /><br />w
B000002U82|4.0|While there are certaintly many great points to 'Dark Side Of The Moon' it still falls short of being the bands best recording. Certaintly the production is smoothe and rich, and the depth of sound is brilliant, but the album falls short on actual tunes. 'Money' probably the most radio played song from the album is really rather grating and far from the best that Pink Floyd have put out. Like wise 'Us And Them' is more dirge like than the anthem is seems to be striving to me. However these are really the only failings of DSOFTM, the rest of which is an intoxicating slightly dark hallucinogenic splendor.  <br /> <br />'Time' is always a poignant statement about growing old no matter how many times you hear it, kicking in perfectly from the tripping instrumental first few opening tracks. 'Great Gig In The Sky' is possibly the best blues the band would ever play. And while the flow is interpreted by the misplaced 'Money' and substandard 'Us And Them', the final trio of 'Any Colour You Like, Brain Damange and Eclipse' is to near as perfect a run of songs you'll find anywhere, merging perfectly together as and almost drowning the you in the multi layered textures of the music. Its a very good album, but the band still had better too offer.
B000003N8R|5.0|The title cut's tenor solo is as good as any music gets.  Rest of album is very fine too.
B00004BZ0N|4.0|But I don't think that every single track of 'London Calling' is indispensible. I know that statement will probably have some calling for my head, but in my opinion its the truth. Its probably true of all double albums but this would have been better as a single (well it is now on cd, but in the days of vynal it was a double). More isn't always better and theres a lot to be said for an albums flow and cohesiveness in making it a better listen. In particular 'Jimmy Jazz, Revolution Rock, Wrong 'Em Boyo and Lovers Rock' could easily have been culled with no real loss.  <br /> <br />However I hate sounding like I hate 'London Calling' because I don't. The opening title track is a bold stomping anthemic statement, it does what the Clash are best at when their on top form, leaving you wanting more. From there though the album takes a very different route. Its a fusion of all the rock that went before them (with the expception of mainstream rock that proceede punk) all filtered through the Clashes own stylings. Mick Jones lays down probably his two best ever vocal performances on 'Lost In The Supermarket' and 'Train In Vain', while Strummer is also on top form with his unique voice being put to work at everything political protest to talking about once great hollywood actors.  <br /> <br />Musically the Clash would never again sound such a tigh unit. Everything here melds to gether perfectly, never sounding over produced as on 'Sandanista' or as jumbled as 'Combat Rock'. Topper Headon holds underpins the whole thing with excellent understated drumming, never lacking flair but never going over the top either. Paul Simonon's bass never sounded better and both Jones and Strummer sound far more accomplished than any British punk guitarists should have at that date. And of course it goes without saying that the real star of this album is Guy Stevens, considered to be washed up before this release, its his oversight and attention to detail that makes 'London Calling' really shine, and make no mistake when its at its best its really very hard to beat.
B0000C8AV2|4.0|... but one of the best albums of Dylan's career. Oh Mercy is particularly remarkable considering what came before it: two of the worst throwaway albums Dylan ever recorded (Knocked Out Loaded and Down in the Groove) and a not-bad album sunk by poppy 80s production (Empire Burlesque). Then when fans were probably about to give up on him, Dylan hooks up with superproducer Daniel Lanois and delivers the excellent Oh Mercy. I think Oh Mercy is almost as good as Dylan's 1997 triumph, Time Out of Mind. Time out of Mind gets the upper hand because the lyrics are so direct and from the heart and there are no weak tracks. Oh Mercy can certainly be seen as a step in that direction, though. Most of the songs are haunting, even mournful, as Dylan talks about the world we live in and his failure at past relationships. There are a couple of upbeat songs to be found, however. The opening Political World is another social commentary similar to Jokerman and Neighborhood Bully from Infidels. Everything Is Broken was the first single, I believe and it's a nice radio-friendly tune, which was covered by Kenny Wayne Shepherd on his Trouble Is... album. Then at track four, we get to the real meat of the album. A set of somber, haunting songs that just knocks me flat. Ring Them Bells, The Man In The Long Black Coat, and Most of the Time are among Dylan's best songs since the Blood on the Tracks era. If the entire album could be as high quality as these songs, then Oh Mercy would be another Blood on the Tracks or Highway 61 Revisited. The album ends on a very high note - the beautiful, melancholy Shooting Star. A couple of weaker tracks keep album from be a true classic: Where Teardrops Fall, What Good Am I and Disease of Conceit. They're not bad songs, just not as good as the rest of the album. However, thanks to the great music and Daniel Lanois' production even the weaker tracks are pretty compelling.     Overall, Oh Mercy is a great album. Not quite up to Dylan's impossibly high standards, but still an excellent album and Dylan's best album since 1975's Blood on the Tracks. That is, until Time Out of Mind in 1997, anyway. Oh Mercy is a must-own album for any Dylan fan except for beginners. You'll want to get all the '60s albums and Blood on the Tracks first.     By the way... regarding the rating, I'd actually give Oh Mercy 4 and 1/2 stars, but Amazon won't allow that.
B000002UAU|3.0|As a music listener I fall into that rare group thats kind of ambivilent towards the Beatles. Don't hate them nor worship them. Some songs are good others less so, but at the end of the day I could take them or leave them. However I'll still review 'Sgt. Peppers'.  <br /> <br />In recent years this albums taken a critical battery among some fans and musical journalists. Well when I say battering I mean its dropped in their esteem to being one of the merely good Beatles albums. Though considering it was once held up almost universally as the pinacle of pop accomplishment that is somewhat of a battering. Part of this could be due to the fact that recently Paul has claimed the album was mainly his inspiration and the Lennon worshippers have reacted by giving the album a downgrading, especially of Paul's contributions.  <br /> <br />Or it could simply be that its not that great. Sure 'With A Little Help From My Friends, She's Leaving Home, Lovely Rita' and of course 'A Day In The Life' are some of the Beatles best, but some of the other songs are pure filler. The 'Sgt. Pepper' inserts (which give rise the idea that this is some how a concept album) are fun better rather redunant and not that essential. 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds' the albums only real delving into psychadelic sounds is rather average for a psychadelic sound of the era, and certaintly not that orginal. George's contribtution 'With You Without You' drags on without doing anything and you kind of want to smash that damned sitar on his head by the end. 'When I'm Sixty-Four' that song that for so long has raised the ire of fans and casual listeners a like isn't all that bad, as a joke ditty, but its not something you want to hear again and again. While some of the other tracks are good, others are forgettable, and all in all album that with only four great tracks isn't worthy of a top rating.
B00005OM5L|5.0|totally awesome   badge, five long years, have you ever loved a woman,and white room are worth the price of this dvd alone,but add in ten more tracks for a 90 minute show and you can't go wrong!!!! can't wait for cream live to be released  oct.4th.
B000AL730O|5.0|It hangs together just like a great album should. Everything fits. Just when you think the song might go south and suck...BAMMM..he throws you a curveball and makes it great! A lot of it reminds me of the White Album, \\"Jenny Wren\\", \\"English Tea\\", \\"Promise To You Girl\\"...then the Wilbury's-ish \\"Friends To Go\\", the Wings-sounding \\"Too Much Rain\\", even if the songs aren't fast they still get stuck in your noggin and you can't get them out of there. I'm a pretty harsh judge of Paul's music since Tug of War, but this might be the best he's ever done, I'm serious.
B000077VPU|4.0|It plays on my DVD player but the colour is not 100% but <br />the sound is good. <br />
B000929AJQ|5.0|If it is one of the top 100 selling albums on Amazon, that's got to tell you this is a killer album (especially considering that it was released in May of this year). This album is actually one of my top favorite NIN albums (in order): <br /> <br />1. Pretty Hate Machine <br />2. With Teeth <br />3. Broken <br />4. Still <br />5. The Downward Spiral <br />6. The Fragile <br />and on.... <br /> <br />As for the album itself... my favorite songs are Sunspots,The line Begins to Blur, Beside You In Time, Right Where It Belongs (\\"Hurt & Great Below-type song). In my opinion, no other NIN album flows as well as this one from song to song (last to first). <br />
B00005K3OT|5.0|I was very happy to find the Chocolat DVD on amazon. I live in South Africa and this dvd is not available in our country at present. I could have it imported through a dvd shop but that would have taken 2 months and would have cost me much more than through Amazon (including shipping). I received the dvd after only 2 weeks. I gave the dvd to a friend as a birthday gift which i think worked very well. Nice movie if you like France and especially if you are a CHOCOLATE fan!!
B00082IJ08|3.0|Hey, this album is alright. I don't \\"like it\\" but I don't \\"hate it\\". You're opinion. I still don't understand how this is a rock band. Anyway, Feel Good Inc, and Dirty Harry are pretty good tracks.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|Great movie but the subtitles were for the hearing impaired. Which is ok but they really need subtitles for people who can hear but don't speak English. Those subtitles need to be written by people for whom English is their first language. I read in a forum that customers can send the DVD to the studio for replacement but that offer seems to be only availale for residents of America. Bad bad bad - don't they know that there are other customers who live outside that country?!!!!
B0009NCQJ6|3.0|Hot looking chick string quartet rockin' the classics and classifying the rock. If you're expecting Emerson, Lake and Palmer - forget it! Bond are just plain fun. They add some rock, techno, dance and world beats...and voila! Too bad this isn't that good of a compilation. If I were to pick the songs for a Bond greatest hits album, it would not be this. Only 12 songs? Buy the original individual CDs and make your own \\"best of\\" instead. By the way, if you like Bond, try out Vanessa Mae - she's even better.
0316666343|1.0|I just finished reading this piece of crap. I closed the book, set it on the coffee table and raised my fist into the air as a look of anger took over.  <br /> <br />Parts of this book sounded like the type of poems and journal entries I would write when I was in high school - sappy, angst-ridden, flowery sounding, garbage. Other parts of this book were completely laughable. I found myself cracking up during the Ray and Susie/Ruth sex scene. If a friend of mine had recently fallen in the street (and possibly suffered a brain trauama)and was then claiming to be the soul/ghost of a dead girl come back to have sex with me - I would take that friend to an insane asylum.  <br /> <br />The book makes no sense. If someone can piece together the rubbish in these pages, please englighten me. I kept waiting for explanations about the different layers of heaven, and about what it meant to fully forgive/let go of trauma - and those answers never came. I wanted the clues from all the murders to be linked together and that never happened. I wanted some kind of cohesive understanding of what the point of the book was - and that never came here. The only thing I can take away from this book is an overly sentamentalized, flowery story for middle-aged women.  <br />
B00079FUI6|5.0|I am a die hard DH fan, and have been from the start.  I was so excited when I heard that the first season DVD was being released, and I suggest that if you enjoy the show that you pick it up.  All the witty story lines and awesome cast aside, it is packed with a ton of extra features for fans who would like to know more about the show and its cast.  I hope everyone enjoys this as much as I have.
0735619670|5.0|Steve McConnel has a true understanding of how to develop a coder into a master software developer.  This reader considers this book as the must have guide to better software.  This book is deeply insightful and very well written.  Steve lays the foundation for developing high quality code and better methodologies of work.  His experience is vast and he gladly shares it with those who wish to learn in this book.  The update for .net is great and glad to see code concepts that actually match the daily coding environment.  Overall I would consider this a must read for anyone serious in software development.
B000AADYYO|2.0|I started out listening to Opeth with the release of Blackwater Park, i thought they were very different and had a lot of versetility. But they never stuck in my head as anything more than a creative band with a nack for making 6 to 12 minute songs, which can become very mundane after awhile. After hearing all of the rest of there albums i see nothing has changed, same ole same ole. Which i didn't expect Ghost Reveries to be much of a change but maybe a little more get up and go, boy was i wrong, this is the same ole walk through the park, dreary(at many times \\"boring\\" music as usual. Blackwater Park still remains my favorite, but i'm still not a \\"big\\" fan of the band at all. I started listening to Into Eternity and thought wow, now THIS is what its all about, great up beat raging guitars with soaring clean chorus's, a touch of death metal and always melodic as hell. Listen to Dead of Dreaming, and Buried In Oblivion if you want to hear something that won't put you to sleep 5 minutes into the songs. I can't even believe Opeth entered the charts at #64 in America, oh well i guess its better than the same ole alternacrap thats out there, although i think Opeth are headed down that road. Also listen to Nevermore's-This Godless Endeavor if you want a real masterpiece.     LISTEN TO INTO ETERNITy and NEVERMORE instead!!!!!!!!!
0060005696|5.0|Though the material gets kind of repetitive towards the end, what he DOES present you with is absolutely fascinating.  The psychological studies that have shown what makes people happy about decisions and events and how that happiness is affected by simple things like attitude, expectation, and comparisons to others were very thought-provoking.  I think he's got the right ideas about not keeping up with the Joneses, or even keeping up with the possible YOUs.  Too often nowadays we feel overwhelmed by all the choices we have to make that don't need to be so comprehensive to leave us satisfied with that choice. <br /> <br />I especially can appreciate his jeans buying experience, as I went into the store for some skin lotion this past winter and was dumbstruck by all the different varieties, and didn't know what to buy because they didn't have the plain yellow bottle I remember from my youth, when there were only 2 varieties. <br /> <br />

0345298349|4.0|Martin Cruz Smith is a former journalist and magazine editor. \\"Gorky Park\\" is his first novel to feature Arkady Renko, was first published in 1981 and is largely set in the Moscow before the collapse of the USSR. Renko, the hero, works as the Chief Homicide Investigator for Moscow's militia - unlike the KGB, who deal with matters if 'State interest', the militia are more or less the standard police force. Renko, therefore, deals with the 'everyday' murders. Displaying one unfortunate trait for a homicide investigator, however, he has a distinct aversion to corpses - though he has a 100% success rate in clearing cases. Unhappily married and somewhat cynical, he's not quite as active a Party member as his wife would like him to be - something that has also had a negative effect on his career. He also appears to be something of a disappointment to his father, a very famous retired General. Renko's boss, Prosecutor Iamskoy, seems to have a certain amount of affection for him though - the Prosecutor actually won an appeal for a worker wrongly convicted of murder thanks to Renko's work.     The book opens in Gorky Park, first park of the Revolution and favoured above all others. Three corpses have been found buried in the snow and, as a result, have been very well preserved. This means that, initially, the time of death can only be estimated as sometime that winter. All three victims - three men and a woman - were all shot through the heart, with the two men also having been shot through the head. The killer, clearly an expert marksman, also has access to a weapon Muscovites cannot typically lay their hands on. No papers could be found on the bodies, which have also been mutilated - the fingerprints and flesh on the faces has been removed, making a quick identification unlikely. One early lead, however, comes from the ice-skates the victims were wearing...    One of the other detectives assigned to the case, Pasha Pavlovich, had worked with Renko previously. Then, three corpses were found at the Kliazma River in remarkably similar circumstances to the Gorky Park killings. The pair immediately suspect the same individual is responsible in this case. However, as the chief suspect at the Kliazma River was a KGB Major called Pribluda, the pair promptly lost that case to the KGB. As Pribluda - who'd actually taken over the Kliazma River case - makes an early appearance at the scene in Gorky Park and interferes with the corpses, Arkady and Pasha expect the KGB to again quickly snatch this case from them. (Pribluda will, of course, be kept right up-to-date : a third detective assigned to the case, Fet, is a known KGB informant). In fact, as the cases progresses, even Renko thinks it looks more and more like a KGB case...though he suspects they would have little desire to `solve' it.       Overall, a very good book and well worth reading - for me, it would comfortably rest in the top tier of the murder-mystery genre. Renko is a very likeable character and, probably because of his `flaws', is very easy to relate with. Recommended.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|A great CD.  He is probably one of the best finds around today.  Relaxing and Fast Music all in one.  Excellent buy!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|<br />I watched the japanese vesrion of the movie and somehow managed to get english subtitles, because I could not wait any longer. <br />The computer generated animations are the best I've ever seen. The story, simple yet intrigating, takes plce two years after the end of the game. The characters' design, locations, weapons, and absolutely everything in this movie is superb. <br />A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE. <br /> <br />Soundtrack is spectacular. All music is just perfect for the moment, and little details make it a musical achievement for the Square Enix team. <br />Fight scenes are incredible,  <br /> <br />Well, everything about this movie is just great.
0743454537|2.0|This novel addresses many ethical, moral, personal, family issues for more than 200 pages in what seem to be interesting (and medically accurate) ways. The ending is not accurate. <br /> <br /> Warning:  If you haven't read the novel, the next sentences will wreck the \\"surprise\\" at the end. <br /> <br />Because I am a medical writer/editor and have friends who have been (a)a living donor of a kidney to a sibling and (b) a spouse who approved donation of all possible organs (tragic drowning; spouse could not be revived), I know that the medical information is just not right....a lawyer can't make the decision...not even a legal guardian of a minor.  Also, relatives would NOT say goodbye to someone still on life support AFTER the organ donation.  Life support is removed before the organs are \\"harvested.\\"  I felt that the writer got to the end of her \\"schedule\\" of a book a year and just wrapped it up fast to meet a publisher's deadline.  Picoult's novels are getting more and more formulaic.  Not a fan any more.

B0002JJBZY|5.0|This is truely a great series to watch! One day I may be damned for asking it, but would we truely remember it the same way had it not ended at season 3?  I think what makes the original series so much a part of popular television culture is that it had so much against it that it was brought down in it's prime.  It was only due to die hard fans who kept watching it once it hit syndication that the legacy began to build and people started to remember it fondly instead of turning a blind eye as they once had.  In turn, it built a wonderful empire of dreams and hopes for a better tomorrow.  Say what you will, but none of the other spinoffs (and their longer broadcast schedules) can hold a candle to the original series. <br /> <br />To be able to see it without worrying if I'll make it home on time, if I remembered to set the VCR, how late it will be on or how many ad breaks will there will be is a great relief.  And to be let in on so much of the history of the show!  To think that they graced season 3 with the Star Trek pilot that could have been...but never was...in two different versions!  As for the sound and picture quality, it's still better than most broadcast copies I've seen.  Over time, only so many sound and picture elements survive...and especially when it's been in such heavy syndication.  In order to perserve some of the special sounds I'm sure that Paramount was forced to only remove the most offensive and problematic static noise and leave the rest alone. <br /> <br />I could list names of shows that are my favorites or reveal plot lines and such...but other people have already made their reviews the same so I'll save more time by also saying it's really amazing how the cast really did help carry the show in every episode.  No need for me to remind everyone of the Holy Trinity of this show...without them it would have crumbled in the wind. <br /> <br />I'll take a slight moment and agree with the one reviewer here who stated that Paramount has overpriced these box sets (individually and even all together).  They have! The high price scares some of my friends from buying the set, and that's a shame because they aren't die hard Trek fans like others I know.  Lowering the price would remove fears from those curious enough to buy, which would mean more buisness for Paramount.   <br /> <br />What's weird (or worse, some may soon cry) is that where I live now (Finland) I picked up each season (individually) for 40 Euros!  As of today (Sept. 19, 2005), that's only $48.59 !  Even all seven ST:TNG box sets are priced individually that low! Quite a price difference on my friends who still live in the United States.  It doesn't matter how many Trek fans live in Finland, the USA OR the rest of the world, but I believe that Paramount should be FAIR to all Trek fans!  At least have a limited time campaign sale to help perk up sales of Star Trek and remove some of these lovely sets from the shelves where they are collecting dust because of the overprice. <br /> <br />To end on a good note, this ENTIRE original series is worth owning.  Paramount must still be commended for making the effort to put out a tv show still making syndicated runs all over the world and giving us access to the troubled yet glorious past it had. It made tv history many times, and remains part of the world's popular culture today.  Star Trek lives on...
B000A59PMO|5.0|After I stumbled upon Veronica Mars and discovered that it was actually amazingly good, my big challenge was to try to get my friends to watch it.  For some reason everyone who had heard of it at all thought that it was a 'Nancy Drew type show'.  No critcism of Nancy implied, but Veronica Mars (both the character and the series) has a very mature, dark and cynical outlook that defies most simplistic expectations.  Veronica isn't always the nicest person; she is cynical, bitter and (highly) vengeful.  She enjoys manipulating people, she can be frighteningly cavalier with the truth (and law... and basic human rights), and she wants to be feared by people that she doesn't like.  But ultimately she is a champion for those who don't have other options. The greatest evil in Veronica's home town of Neptune, is not a serial killer or even the murderer of Veronica's best friend; it is the caste driven system which disenfranchizes many of Veronica's peers, while elevating others.  Veronica Mars is not all social message or politically posturing though, and it brings to the table a number of strengths that make it standout (head and shoulders) among the current crop of teen dramas (the best since Buffy).    -Great writing; particularly in the witty repartee and in Veronica's often wickedly cynical expository voice over.  -Kristen Bell's extraordinary range and dead on delievery.  Unlike many actor's trying to play smart, she actually seems very smart, and very competent.  -A strong story arc that threads through each episode, driving Veronica's actions.    -A great supporting cast (both regular and recurring) playing complex characters that have their own agendas and who grow and change throughout the season.    There are many dynamics that go on in a show this complex, some of which work better than others.  From the central murder mystery of Lily Kane, to Veronica's search forher mother, and her complex relationships with her father, Kieth Mars; Logan Echolls; and Duncan Kane; we are given both great drama and a real mystery.  Saying more runs the risk of giving away too much for those who haven't seen it.  Let it suffice to say I rank Veronica Mars with Lost, as one of the two best, new dramas from last season... And I for one cannot wait for the next mystery to unfold.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|A most delightful combination of traditional \\"classical\\" celtic music, and a few more popular American selections.  Great musicianship and natural, clear, crisp voices.  Repeated listenings only increase the pleasure.
B0001I55OC|4.0|Richard Donner's TIMELINE has nary a dull monent.  We are kept busy in either this time with a group of scientists, the leader of whom is cavalier with human life, or in medieval times (in 1357) with brutish lords and rather dazed archeologists, the latter of whom struggle mightily to rescue one of their own who went off on an ill-advised trip through a \\"stable\\" wormhole.<br /><br />The movie is highly entertaining, with good acting turns by Gerard Butler, David Thewlis, Michael Sheen, and Billy Connolly, among others.  And even though the concept of faxing people through time (with transcription errors) strains the imagination a tad, they make it work.<br /><br />The lesson that really strikes home is how callous those with authority can be in this time or any other.  The head of ITC, Robert Doniger, played cooly by David Thewlis, really gives less than a damn about what his process does to those who undergo it, as long as ITC isn't held responsible.  In the 13th century, we have Lord Oliver (Michael Sheen) who stands impreturbed on the castle battlements as arrows and fire sent by trebuchets massacre his men all around him---but why should we be surprised since he murdered one of the hapless archeologists upon their arrival?<br /><br />Gerard Butler's archeologist, Marek, goes through and intriguing transformation as we see him evolve from a dazed professor into quite a knight himself---he makes the transformation a logical progression as he realizes where he belongs at the movie's end.<br /><br />Lots of adventure, lots of brutality---mediaval style---, and romances that do and don't work.  In short, something for everyone.  This one is worth the effort

B000050XEI|5.0|And I'll tell you why. <br /> <br />Many of the disparaging reviews sound so much alike, you would think that one person wrote them. Most of them run along these lines. <br /> <br /> \\"I have been an Enya fan for the past fifty years. When I was in my mother's womb, she played Enya. However, I am DISAPPOINTED in this CD. Because it's not DARK and MYSTERIOUS like her former works. And EVERYONE KNOWS that people who like DARK MYSTERIOUS THINGS are melancholy artists who alone feel the true rhythm of Mother Earth.\\" <br /> <br /> Other critics write reviews somewhat along the lines of the following. <br /> <br /> \\"It makes me SICK when people write about how this CD helped them to heal after 9/11. How DARE they say this! Even if it DID help them, MY sense of outrage is aroused!\\" <br /> <br /> My advice to both of these types of critics are <br /> <br /> 1: Curb your ego, the curdled reaches of this gelatinous mass are already seeping onto my keyboard. <br /> <br /> 2: If you have a problem with people using this CD to deal with grief, trauma, if it causes you extreme distress and/or you begin to froth at the mouth... <br /> <br /> Listen to \\"A Day Without Rain\\" <br /> <br /> It's very relaxing.

B000AJJNPY|4.0|I was initially introduced to Sigur Ros because a friend of mine knew I liked Radiohead, and she thought the singers sounded similar. True to an extent, and even between the two bands as wholes there are many similarities. But Sigur Ros is certainly a different animal. To be honest, I didn't dig it too much the first listen, which amazes me in retrospect because it was Untitled 4 off of (), which is an amazing song. Maybe I wasn't paying as close attention as I should have. Maybe I wasn't in a suitable emotional state at the time. I may sound like Captain Obvious to some of you, but Sigur Ros is all about mood.  <br /> <br />My first suggestion when you sit down with Takk, is make sure you're in the right mood. Get a pair of headphones that will shut out all the outside noise and bring you up close and personal with the sound, because there are many delicate layers of instrumentation. The album reminds me in many ways of (), though I don't think it's quite as good.  <br /> <br />Now, this could change. Sigur Ros tends to grow on you. Repeated listens will accentuate some of the aforementioned layers, and there's usually something new to catch with each new listen. <br /> <br />As far as specific tracks go, Glosoli is undoubtedly king here. I wouldn't say there is a bad song on the album, but probably only four or five really jumped out at me. I won't mention which ones, because I myself hate reading about which specific tracks aren't quite up to snuff. Don't jump into the album with preconceived notions, because you might find yourself not paying enough attention to a track that someone bashed, anxiously awaiting the \\"good\\" ones. Glosoli though, man I had to point it out. It's breathtaking. It reminds me of Untitled 6 from (), but it's different and unique in itself. I would buy the album simply for that song and it'd be one of the most prudent purchases I've made in quite a while. <br /> <br />In closing, I guess I should just say that Takk could very well be a five star album. I need to listen to it a few more times...the other three albums grew on me and I expect nothing less from Takk. But there are some songs on here that are timeless. I feel sorry for people who've not yet been exposed to Sigur Ros or are too narrow-minded to give them a chance. When they are in their element, they can make you feel like they're the greatest band on earth.
B000000WJK|5.0|This album by The Verve is one of the most important albums ever. Every single song on here is mind blowing, from the opening song Star Sail, with it's wispy and feathery guitar lines to See you In The Next One( HAve A Good Time). Each song on here is absolutely insanely perfect. These people who are saying the sound quality is poor and offensive, I have one name for you....John Leckie, he's a genius and if you know anything about anything in British music you would know what he's capable of. I must say this album redefined a lot of parameters in music for the 90's. The Verve are easily the most important band of the 1990's.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This album supports all Pink Floyd and really gives you there sound. Songs from all of their albums really makes this album show how incredible Pink Floyd is. However, this is definately all the Pink Floyd that you need! Each Pink Floyd Album is a very unique thing, and must be listened to, through and through, not skipping track sort of thing. That's just not how Pink Floyd works... So in conclusion, this is a great album that gives you there full sound and has some really killer stuff from other albums, but to really enjoy them, you are going to need to actually listen to the albums that these great tracks are from.
0385507755|5.0|Unputdownable from start to finish . . . a must read for anyone born of human . . . you will either hate this book or love it . . . makes the Da Vinci code look $@#$%!!! Can't wait to read the sequel and enjoy more of Frey's refreshing style of writing
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This album, is not as good as everyone says, it's better! this album has changed rock and roll and has single handedly basically influenced every single rock band today. The instrumental work is great, the vocals are great, everything is ausom! I love this album as much as I love Operation Ivy's album Energy. Every track has really got something new to it, and the song London Calling has got to be the best song ever written. If you love this album, which I'm sure that you will, you should get their other album that's just called The Clash, it's another great one.<br /><br />This album is a musical monument.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This album is definitley a classic,it sounds like an album that would be suited to the atmosphere of a sweaty irish pub. I only like \\"Some Girls\\" more than this album.
B0007O38F8|1.0|lol. I'm laughing so hard... I do so dearly hate this album... Oh and by the way, incase you where to stupid to notice, he has no musical talent and is obsessed with killing people. Yo 50! I got a little rap for you my friend!<br /><br />yo, yo, im 50 cent<br /><br />my face is ugly and it's full of crap<br /><br />People try to shoot me,<br /><br />I wonder why?<br /><br />maybe it's because I'm dumb and I don;t know why...<br /><br />son...

I wouldn't pay 50 cents for it!
630542828X|5.0|I originally got dragged to this movie and expected a Grisham-esque ripoff. However, I found this movie to be an outstanding study of the different roads people decide to go down in life - Duvall's cynical and heartless character shows us the dark and lonely one - and Travolta's character the bright, but still lonely road. <br /> <br />I bought the DVD so I can watch it every once in awhile and remind myself why it's best to be good and do the right thing - even if it means going broke in the process. John Travolta's revealing smile in the end is priceless. <br /> <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I just saw FF AD and all I can say it's that if you want to enjoy an awesome visual experience and regardless some comments, a great storyline, this is a MUST!. You'll  never regret it.
B00005JOHU|5.0|Nicholas Cage does a dynamic job portraying Yuri Orlov, a lowly Brooklynite turned international arms trafficker in the thriller Lord of War.  The timeline of the film starts as Orlov sells weaspons during the waning cold war years to Soviet strongmen, than he switches over to getting warlords and child soldiers as customers in Liberia and Sierra Leone.  Eamonn Walker does an excellent job playing the sociopath Liberian president, Andre Baptiste Sr.  Orlav makes it clear from the beginning of the film that he is a businessman.  He doesn't care who gets guns; it matters more that they are using his products.  \\"There are enough guns for one out of every twelve people in the world,\\" said Orlov.  \\"It is my job to get guns to the other eleven.\\"  Even when he is asked if guns are more dangerous than cigerettes, he states that at least guns have safety pins.  Throughout the film Orlov has his family telling him that what he is doing is wrong.  It is interesting to see if Orlov ever has a change of heart.  Despite the fact that there are arms traffickers all over the world, it is hard to be mad at Orlov because many governements,  such as China, Russia, France, UK and US allow these people to carry on their work.  Coincidentally all the above countries are permanent members of the UN Security Council.  This is a fascinating film for anyone interested films with socially redeeming value.
0385338686|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I couldn't put it down.  You fell in love with the characters and it was a funny, lighthearted, romantic story.  I would definitely recommend this book!
0385495323|5.0|This book is just very well done.  Singh takes a topic that could easily be dry and confusing and instead makes it fascinating and clear.  He accomplishes this seemingly difficult task with apparent ease by using colorful and relevant historic tales to go along with the use and breaking of each cipher he discusses in his book.  Singh also demonstrates a rare gift for explaining complex mathematics in a manner that is clear and engaging even for a rank amateur reader.  <br /> <br />The result of all this is a book that goes into genuine depth on a very complex and technical topic without ever leaving the layperson behind or resorting to writing that would bore a more advanced reader to tears.   <br /> <br />This is simply a very impressive book and a really fun one to read.  It will leave you more knowledgeable about codes, ciphers, and encryption and how they fit into past, present, and future. <br /> <br />Vey highly recommended if knowing more about codes and ciphers sounds even mildly interesting to you.
B00000IQW3|5.0|I introduced this movie to our boys recently and it was a big hit. Some movies are timeless and this is one of them. It is a true 80's classic that can be ranked with The Goonies, The Lost Boys, The Explorers, and Space Camp. Our boys enjoyed it just as much as we did as teens when it first came out and have added it to their favorite old movie collection soncisiting of some of the titles I mentioned above. It's great to be able to sit back and share things from our generation with our kids and see it through new eyes.
B00082IJ08|4.0|If this is the first Gorillaz CD you've ever bought, you're in for a treat. It's a great mix of music, blending hip-hop beats with pop, techno, and--dare I say it--country? Long-time fans probably won't be disappointed, as the new album has a fresher sound than previous releases. I'm just kinda bummed that it took this long for them to get really popular.  <br />What I really like about Gorillaz is that none of their songs sound the same. Standout tracks include \\"Feel Good INC\\" (of course!) \\"Kids with Guns\\" and \\"Dare\\".  <br />Seriously, get this album! If you're tired of all the music out today and want something new, \\"Demon Days\\" will definitely satisfy your craving.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I would reccomend this to anyone who is interested in World War II. I'm a history buff and I couldn't wait to see it. They did an outstanding job on this mini-series.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Amazing ... but not for everyone.
B0007M22TI|5.0|This dvd is wonderful.  I've never been so turned on to celtic music before. Did i mention all of the women are beautiful??? You have to get this....if you are on the fence, please buy it. It even inspired me to buy a Tin Whistle or Penny Whistle, some may call it, and i can play several of the parts in the songs. (i already play several instruments, so in no way does this mean you can do that) but anyway, thats my story. buy it.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Atlantis does the SG1 series justice with great stories and great acting. Most shows take a year or 2 before the actors come together. But with Atlantis.....starts off that way from the get go. For the price of the set, you can bet one thing, you are going to get your moneys worth and I can see Atlantis going for several years like SG1 has done.
0689815816|5.0|This is a book to delight children ages 1 to 5.  The repetition of silly onomatopoeic sounds and rhythmic language delight children just acquiring meaningful sounds, and the excitement of the \\"hunt\\" builds suspense nicely.  The low-key and soft illustrations, along with a comically surprised bear, help mitigate the tension for those with too vivid imaginations.  The simple message that sometimes the search for thrills can find more than we bargained for is handled deftly and without any moralizing overtones.  Fun for the reader, too!
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I LOVED IT...this is an unbelievable album, damian is an unbelievable artist, he is def. going to be around for a while! <br /> <br />Fav. songs: <br />Welcome to jamrock <br />confrontation <br />beautiful <br />there for you <br />in 2 deep <br />road to zion <br />hey girl <br />
B00000G3PA|5.0|I want to say that Michael Bay is probably one of my favorite directors in Hollywood along with Steven Spielberg, Steven Soderberg, and James Cameron. You probably think because I like Michael Bay's films that I'm a mindless idiot. it's just that sometimes I just like to watch a fun, action-packed movie. And thats what Michael delivers. I highly recommend his best movie \\"The Rock\\" after watching this movie. Armageddon delivers everything this kind of movie should. Action, amazing special effects, humor, and a little romance. If you want to sit back and just have some fun, some laughs, and some tears, this movie is just your ticket. I also recommend, The Island, War of the Worlds, Oceans Eleven & Twelve, and the underrated masterpiece Empire of the sun. Thanks for listening.
B00079HZUM|5.0|I have saw this movie before I bought it on Amazon.com.  It is a great movie and a very insightful peak into the life of actors and actresses around the time of King Charles (#?) of England.  It has some very witty lines and is very well done.  If you don't like Shakespear I would not recomend that you see this movie, that is what the actors do in this movie... act out Shakespear.  I would also not recomend seeing it if you are uncomfeterable with gay sex sceens.  Anyway, have fun with it and keep an open mind.
0441009425|5.0|Several descriptions come to mind when I think about this novel: Erudite, mind-blowing, literate, dark, wondrous.  It's a classic space opera with a galaxy for a stage. I'm a sucker for tales about \\"lost aliens who may have left clues\\" particularly those stories in which the characters are as well-developed as these.  Dan (and dad) are nearly perfect as flesh and blood guys of the 26th century.  The love affair between Dan and his wife was gentle, touching, real. The story, which develops into a convoluted though thoroughly-explainable plot, keeps one's attention. <br /> <br />There is one major plotline and several sub-plots: The aliens and their message drives the story forward. The relationship between Dan and Cal is like all father-son relationships - complex, moody, territorial. Then there is the band of Russians who've almost evolved via machinery past humanity. Finally, merging the past and future is the assassing Khouri with all her secrets.  In the end it is human beings that matter the most - over the most far-reachingn science fiction. Perhaps there were too many  characters, a common problem with many authors, but the novel's length enabled the author to \\"flesh out\\" everyone.  <br /> <br />What blows the mind are the descriptions of the inventions, the nanotechnology, the biological changes of the human race, the almost inevitable merging of man and machine.  The ending, surprisingly, was weak - a little too over the top as if the author could not rest on his laurels. The reader is hit by too many dazzling, out of the world visions and events to enjoy and savor.  All in all a dazzling book for which I am sure there is a sequel. <br /> <br />
0780622553|5.0|Stylistic, dark, surreal, sci-fi thriller, that does not spoon feed you the usual, invaders from Mars shoot em-up tripe. Really quite deep, if you are a little fed up with standard fare give this one a try but be ready for a challenge! Definitely an epic masterpiece that is over most heads. Awesome ending. Also I enjoyed the commentary of Roger Ebert, which in itself is quite surreal.
6305922756|5.0|You have to see this movie , it really is like rock bands and the things they say and do , heart wrenching at times and heart warming at others. It reminds me of when I was a Freshman in High School and I signed on for the wrestling team. A few problems here, first of all the weight class's started at 98# I weighed 88#  when the moon was not full.  <br />   Wrestling requires physical fitness that can not be faked. I was completely confused about the whole game. First of all I was a runt who spent his time goofing off, riding my mini bike, and shooting some hoops. I signed up for this God Awful sport/game/torture and the next thing I know I am running six miles with short little legs that would have equated (if my calculations are correct) to 35 miles.  <br />  I managed to compete in a number of meets and  remember thinking during the various match's. How did he move that fast? Why do I feel all crunched up? How come he wont let go of me? What did I do to deserve this? I ended up with a perfect record, no wins all loss's... I retired after the first year and to this day am proud of my efforts. <br />  If you dont buy this DVD then I challenge you to a wrestling match! I tell you boxers, martial artists whatever... if you let a wrestler get a hold of you its over, since most fights end up on the ground the wrestler has the advantage. So buy the DVD or suffer my skilled wrath.
B000062YAZ|5.0|What more can I say? \\"Reign In Blood\\" is, to me, the finest metal album ever recorded, regardless of genre, and represents Slayer at their face-melting best. No other album I have heard can match its raw, savage energy and brutality. These 10 songs gel together brilliantly to form what is not so much a collection of individual tracks but a cohesive unit, 28 minutes of sheer metallic bliss. This is definately an album worthy of the word \\"essential\\". I remember buying this album, putting it in my stereo, then sitting on my bed beside the player and pressing the \\"play\\" button. The opening chords of \\"Angel Of Death\\" (my favourite song of all time) exploded out of the speakers, grabbing me by the throat and not letting go until the the thunderstorm at the end of \\"Raining Blood\\" faded away and I was left gasping for air, my eyes wide, my eardrums in shreds. Every song is a masterpiece: the psychotic, breathless adrenalin rush of \\"Necrophobic\\"; \\"Jesus Saves\\", the menacing guitar intro leading you into savage thrash hell; the meaty stomp of \\"Criminally Insane\\"; the catchy yet brutal \\"Epidemic\\"; the moody, disturbing \\"Postmortem\\"; and of course the legendary, unforgettable riff to the classic \\"Raining Blood\\" - plus every other track on the album. The muscianship is equally stunning: Tom Araya snarls like a rabid dog, Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King provide crunching rhythms and screeching solos, and Dave Lombardo provides the sort of lightning-fast, laser-precision drumming that would become his signature (check out the kick-drum fill towards the end of \\"Angel Of Death\\" - incredible). All this is brought to you by one of the best production jobs Rick Rubin has ever laid down: listening to it makes you feel that the band are an inch from your face, playing at full throttle. It changed my life; \\"Reign In Blood\\" is an album that transcends the simple plain of music, becoming something almost living, breathing, a best friend I can always count on to cheer me up when I'm down. I know these sort of phrases are bandied around a lot these days, but this time it is truly fitting: if you are fan of metal in any of its myriad forms, just go out and get this album. I simply hope it will bring you as many hours, days, months and years of sheer unadulterated bliss that it has brought me.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Excellent series.  Why did it get cancelled?  Simple, Fox made some bad decisions, that's all.  The series is very good.  Almost everyone that watches even one or two episodes becomes a strong fan of the series.  Look at the bright side--with only 14 episodes, it's easy to watch the entire series.  There's a movie coming out at the end of Sept. 2005 (in the U.S. -- release dates for other locations around the globe vary)  This movie would probably have never happened were it not for the very high sales of the DVDs.  There's a reason the DVDs have sold so well, and it is because the series is so very, very good.
B00005JNDZ|4.0|Rene Zellweger was nominated for the Oscar for the first Bridget Jones' Diary film in 2001.  She was also nominated for a Golden Globe award for her performance in this sequel.  Beeban Kidron whose Hollywood directorial debut was for \\"Used People\\" in 1992 and also had a moderate hit with \\"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar,\\" takes the slapstick and pratfalls to the next level in her work on this film.  The pacing on the film is brisk and keeps us riveted to the fine actors' performances.  Zellweger has gone from success to success with her Oscar nominated performance in \\"Chicago\\" and her Best Supporting Oscar win for \\"Cold Mountain.\\"  She puts on a few pounds and makes Bridget seem like a real woman caught up in the strangeness of her life.  The sequence in Thailand where she lands in a jail and teaches all the Thai inmates to sing is hilarious.  What really works about the film is the romance.  As Mark Darcy, Colin Firth has a magnetism that he's been able to show repeatedly on film (\\"A Month in the Country,\\" \\"Valmont,\\" \\"Circle of Friends,\\" \\"The English Patient,\\" \\"Shakespeare In Love,\\" \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\").  As the somewhat stiff barrister, he shows great heart while still maintaining that British reserve.  The fight sequence in the pond with Hugh Grant is hilarious.  The DVD extras where Grant & Firth repeatedly put each other down like, \\"He's gaining some weight,\\" or \\"He's showing his age,\\" is good-natured fun.  Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver is again one of Britain's best comic actors with great timing and charming good looks.  While Cleaver is as sleazy as ever, he's also hilariously sleazy, and the audience feels that the character just can't help himself.  All in all, while a bit more slapstick than the first film, this sequel puts a smile on your face and is a satisfying good time.  Was it good for you?  :)  Enjoy!
0375405380|4.0|I heard of this book through an NPR review.  It chronciles Art Keller's career (and personal drug war) from 1975 through 2004.  He is half Anglo and half Hispanic; a DEA agent.  Early on he works with Don Barrera to take down the existing Mexican drug kingpin.  He was, however, being used by Barerra to do so.  Barerra prompted established the Federation, which he ran out of Guadalajara.  Three other drug lords were given the three major border territories.  Barerra took the Federation from marijuana and heroin to cocaine, especially crack.   <br />     Keller spends much of his career trying to get Barrera and, later, his sons.  He is able to plant a bug in Barrera's mistress' apartment and he tips off local U.S. agencies to loads of product. <br />    The story fits with what is generally known about the \\"War\\" on Drugs.  And it fits all too well with some very serious allegations about U.S. governmental complicity with Mexican drug trafficking.  Such as:  higher-ups were involved, and may even have used the drug trade to send arms to Central and South America.  I have read other reader reviews of this book and this aspect has not been mentioned.  It gives one pause as the book certainly makes unofficial U.S. involvement eminently plausible. <br />     The book is a very good read; moves along well.  The political implications are merely an extra.  Highly recommended.
0066620996|5.0|Well, this book is full of business common sense, but it states what we don't want to say.  <br /> <br />For those just out of school, like me, from the school experience, you don't need to spend much time on the work(study) as long as you pass the exam and submit the homework on time. A lot of short cut out there to save your energy.  <br /> <br />However, my boss told me when I joined the company, \\"there is no short-cut, you have to work hard and catch up with others bit by bit; Mostly, a short-cut ends up with embarassing yourself...\\".  <br /> <br />The author confirms the idea that all the successful changes happen by building the momentum, slow in the beginning. Although it looks happened overnight from outside. <br /> <br />I think this book lets me know some of the rules to make the business better. I am happy with buying and reading it.
B0000028M7|5.0|I may not be a Gen-X'er, but Alice in Chains still claims a certain power over me. After hearing about the miraculous wonder that is Layne Staley's voice, I was slightly dissappointed to find that his vocal chords produced a racket that sounded, at first note, like a new Sesame Street Monster. However, they grew on me, and quickly. Staley's occasional guitar solos are also pretty good, and Cantrell's riffs have you headbanging in your chair. The bassist's contributions are not limited to riffs; he does have a few solos, and the drummer isn't bad, though he puts a bit too much on the bell cymbal.    The opening track, \\"Them Bones,\\" starts with an aforementioned crunching riff and Staley's aforementioned voice shouting the blues. Track two, \\"Dam That River,\\" is also a good, hard cut, although not a \\"clever play on words\\" as past indicated. Track four, \\"Down In A Hole,\\" is a nice, slow song that certainly leaves you no ambiguity over Staley's current position. The following song, \\"Sickman,\\" has a catchy beat and is both grating and pleasing to the ears. Track six, the famous \\"Rooster,\\"starts off very well, but is repetitive. By the third time you hear \\"Yeah, here come the Rooster....oh, yeah\\" and the accompanying music \\"explosion,\\" you may be tired of this song.    The last three tracks, \\"Hate to Feel,\\" \\"Angry Chair\\" and \\"Would\\" close out the album on very different notes. \\"Hate to Feel\\" is slow and rough, with very good verses. When I close my eyes, I see three Staley's, inside of a hazy bar, singing the catchy tune together in what would make a great musical. Seriously, the two could sit in the corner, a cigarette hanging from their mouths, their hats pulled over their eyes as they vocalize, \\"wish I couldn't see at alllll\\" while the first stands emotionless at the microphone singing about pin cushion medicine. Yeah. So. Next!    \\"Angry Chair\\" is hard, fast, pounding and really damn good. It may be the best song on the album. The closer, \\"Would,\\" is slow and unlike any other song on the album, and though it sounds good, for the most part, I dislike the \\"white-noise\\" guitar in the background, as opposed to the bruising riffs of the other songs.    All told, this is a very good CD. I named just the songs that stuck out most to me; they are all worth listening to. Buy.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Rammstein is the best thing to come out of Germany since the Volkswagen! This group kicks ass!!! American Rock hasn't yet evolved into what Rammstein currently embodies. I call it Rock \\"with feeling\\". The songs all actually have much thought put into them with poetic lyrics as well as great beats blended into great music.<br /><br />The albums to buy are:<br /><br />1. Reise, Reise<br /><br />2.Mutter<br /><br />3.Sehnsucht<br /><br />...skip Herzeleid...
B00005JNTX|2.0|Typical Quentin Tarantino film.  You either love him or you hate him.  This film was very gratuitous sex and violence wise. Not a whole lot of deep plot thinking. I did give it atleast two stars for the unusual filming techniques and special effects.
B000001Y2U|4.0|Manson's album Antichrist Superstar is the best he's created so far. The lyrics I heard when I listened to Holy Wood and Mechanical Animals a few weeks ago just to see what Manson's hype was all about, weren't what I expected from an artist with such a grand following. Buy this album and you'll enjoy it for weeks, but avoid Manson's other CD's, especially \\"Smells like Children\\"
B0007M22TI|5.0|This DVD is a blend of celtic and irish music that has not been seen as far as I know.  Music is very important to me because I am a trained vocalist.  This dvd shows almost no difference between the vocalist and the musicians which is rare and unique. <br />I personally enjoyed the style and freedom of espression given to the musicans. They have the privildge to gift to us the style of song that was before now handed down by generations, from grandmother to granddaughter or son.  It is a wonderful gift of tradition, old world story telling, and newer music we are all familiar with.  The arrangements are beautiful and insightful and full of the celtic color and flair.  I would recommend it to any parent who has a child in a orchestra program or who has any interest in music.  It gives a unique view of expression with the violin that is awesome.  All the arrangements are well done and easy to listen to and enjoy. A must have for any celtic in spirit.
B000AOENJA|5.0|I just wanted to post, because it looks like the other reviewer was more upset about it not working on his computer then the actual cd, although he said it was a great album. The only song I don't really care for is track 6 I'm particularly partial to the first five songs, but the whole album is really good.
B00005JODA|4.0|Ralph Fiennes stars as Justin Quayle in \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" a film based on the novel of the same name by John Le Carr&eacute;.  Fiennes is a diplomat with the British High Commission who meets Tessa, played by Rachel Weisz, when she publicly rails against a speech he has just delivered. Justin and Tessa have completely opposite temperaments. He is undemonstrative and introspective; she is passionate and outspoken.  Still, they fall in love and end up traveling to Kenya as man and wife.<br /><br />In Kenya, Rachel spends a great deal of time with a man whom she grows to admire greatly, a black doctor named Arnold Bluhm.  Much to their horror, Rachel and Arnold uncover a conspiracy that endangers the African people for whom they care so much.  Heedless of their personal safety, the two crusaders plan to reveal what they have discovered.  Before they get their chance, they are brutally murdered and a false cover story is circulated to explain the crime.  Justin Quayle has a choice to make.  Should he go back to his quiet existence in England and try to move on with his life?  Or should he conduct his own investigation into Tessa's death?<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes is an exceptionally expressive actor whose face reveals, during different scenes in the film, hurt, jealousy, grief, and rage.  Rachel Weisz's Tessa is a beautiful and sensitive woman who wears her heart on her sleeve.  She never holds back when she sees injustice, and she refuses to puts her personal safety ahead of her concern for others.  In smaller roles, Hubert Kound&eacute; exudes warmth as the compassionate Dr. Arnold Bluhm, Danny Huston is effectively slimy as two-faced Sandy Woodrow, a colleague of Justin's with his own agenda, and Bill Nighy is a chilling Sir Bernard Pellegrin, a man whom it is most unwise to cross.<br /><br />Credit goes to the director, Fernando Meirelles, and the cinematographer, C&eacute;sar Charlone, for the sweeping shots of Africa, with screeching flocks of birds wheeling towards an endless sky.

B000BB1MI2|5.0|<br />By creating a beautifully crafted town with a mysterious chocolate factory at one end of the town and the struggling Bucket family living in a shabby, tilted and weather beaten house at the other end, the audience was treated to a wonderful journey. <br /> <br />The chocolate bar making at the factory in the opening credits was a great animation sequence, especially the wrapping of the bars by the robotic hands. Don't enter the cinema late!  <br /> <br />While the Bucket family was deprived from food and material comforts, it was more than made up for by the love and attention among the son, parents and 4 grandparents. Charlie's quest for one of the five golden tickets to the chocolate factory was never smooth and easy. His heart (so did the audience's) sank lower each time the news announced another ticket found elsewhere and he himself unwrapped another ticketless bar. The atmosphere was intense when Charlie's grandparent sent him to buy one more bar with his own last coin. When the screen darkened as the grandfather closed his eyes, the audience suspected that the grandfather was just gone for good. Not so, fortunately. <br /> <br />The second part of the movie took us to watch how the rich kids, succumbed to temptations (gluttony, spoiledness, competitveness, TV game addiction), were eliminated one after another (reality show?). In the nut sorting room, when the innocent looking squirrels, sensing the threat of the approaching girl, stopped their nut-cracking and prepared for attack, gave people the creeps.  <br /> <br />Charlie's grandparents and parents, with their big screen shots, have displayed their love of Charlie well. But it was Freddie Highmore who was a natural. He portrayed the young and determined Charlie who would not give up his family for anything else. Johnny Depp, with his sinister look every now and then when he detected the unlovable traits of the \\"sophisticated\\" children, built up an unpredictable and secretive air around him.  <br /><br />The inside of the factory was richly imagined and luxuriously decorated, from a food paradise of luscious colours to top of the notch invention room and flying elevator. The movie succeeded in placing that the people at the centre, they were never dwarfed nor sidetracked by the special effects and the colorful props.  <br /> <br />Does the movie appeal to the child side in every person? Absolutely. Does the film appeal to the adult side in every one? To some extent. Yes. A delightful movie with a heart this is. <br />
B000A3DFZE|3.0|I've been a fan of Eric Clapton for a long time. Starting with the box set, which I got for xmas in the fifth grade, I've got quite a collection of his work, seen him in concert, and feel like I have a pretty good handle on him and his sound.<br /><br />Let me first say that \\"Back Home\\" is a very well produced album. The album is coherent and brings together a great collection of vocalists and musicians.<br /><br />That being said, my favorite album of his is \\"From the Cradle.\\"  If you know how that album sounds, well then \\"Back Home\\" is the opposite of it. Clapton has apparently resurrected what my father and I affectionately call \\"The Clapton Backup Singers\\". I think they're in just about every song. The result are tracks that sound like background music for tv spots, and no doubt you'll be hearing at least one of these in a car or yogurt commercial in the near future.<br /><br />One bright spot that is readily apparent is the guitar work in \\"Lost and Found\\". This is one of the few moments in the album where Eric's Fender shines.<br /><br />Some tracks like \\"One Day\\" and \\"Love Don't Love Nobody\\" have a smoothness and r&b edge that would fit well in the bedroom, but is not really Clapton's forte. While he does give a valiant effort, the first thing I think of is Rod Stewart's dabbling with the same sound from his \\"If We Fall in Love Tonight\\" album.<br /><br />Overall, this release is feel-good pop confection done very well, just not my speed at all.
B000066NW0|3.0|I was an anti-Avril for a long time due to her whole \\"Im a skater thing\\" but then I realized taht at least she admits that shes pop not punk. While, not an amazing album it really stands out in the rest of the sucky pop scene. If your a pop fan this will make your selection at least a liiiiiiiiiiittle better.

B000067CPX|5.0|At last! The Red Hot Chili Peppers have found the true Rock sound! This album is much better than Californication and certainly much better than BSSM, which is the worst \\"Rock\\"-album ever. But now about this album, I bought it because I already had Greatest Hits and Californication and there were some very good songs on those two. So I decided to give By The Way a change and I listened to it on amazon and I was blown away by the music! It just sounds very good! The sound is much less funk and much more rock, so I bought it, and now I'm listening to it over and over and I still like it. The best tracks are \\"By the Way (funk, but not too much funk), Dosed (great voice!), Can't Stop (same as By The Way), Midnight (just catchy song), Tear (Not a Red Hot Chili Peppers Sound, but I love it) and On Mercury. And now you have to stop reading reviews and buy By The Way!!
B0006L16N8|2.0|...to remember a band from the early 70's named \\"Bread\\", they were a band that produced very nice, never offensive, mellow music that was pretty popular there for a while.  <br />JUST like Coldplay, except Bread's singer wasn't annoying.

B00005NKKY|5.0|Simon and Garfunkel are legends. Their albums are among the best ever recorded. Bookends is the best of them all. It contains more mood and emotion than any other.  America may be their best song ever and Hazy Shade of Winter can not be listened to without listening to it twice (it is way to short).  <br />I love this ablum for the mood, the music and the words.
B000006NXP|5.0|I have always found Carlos Kleiber an interesting and enigmatic conductor.  One whose performances are worth hearing time and again.  Ditto with this fine recording. <br /> <br />Brahms might also be viewed as an enimga, and his dense orchestral works either attract or put people off.  As with many listeners, my earliest introduction to Brahms was via his symphonies, in my case von Karajan, Walter and an old Toscanini mono set.  While I continued to listen to Brahms on CD and in the concert hall, eventually my listening turned more towards his chamber and vocal works. <br /> <br />A few years ago I decided it was time to look more closely at the Brahms symphonies.  This recording has been one of my recent discoveries and has rekindled my interest in Brahms the symphonist.  Kleiber and the legendary VPO turn in a first rate and very interesting performance.   <br /> <br />Listening to this CD I was able to notice little things about the orchestration and the tempos that were handled just a little differently than I had heard before.  Also, there is an energy to it that that one frequently finds lacking with peformances of Brahms symphonies.  I could go on with more specifics, but better you make your own observations.  My advice, buy it and listen!
0671027387|1.0|After reading Deception Point, Digital Fortress and The DaVinci Code, I can tell Dan Brown is all style but no substance. All three books have great style and pace, but all the research is really messed up, so there's no real substance. I'm not reading anything else from this author.

B000002UJQ|2.0|I became acquainted with Radiohead for the first time a few weeks ago because of a tribute album called \\"Anyone can Play Radiohead\\". I had never paid attention to this group before. The thing was that there was a song in this tribute called \\"Exit Music (for a film)\\" which was performed by Miranda Sex Garden (one of my favourite bands). A cover version that, by the way, is surprisingly good if we take into account the limitations of Radiohead's genuine material. I say this because, after downloading the aforementioned MSG cover (far more moving and powerful than the original), I decided to listen a little bit to Radiohead looking for something out of the ordinary. My expectations, however, were not satisfied when I began to experience \\"O.K Computer\\" (a \\"masterpiece\\" according to many -to many fans, of course-). The loathing whinings and bleatings of Thom Yorke were utterly irritating to me; few times have I met such an unbearable singer (didn't we have enough with people like Morrisey, Bono and other self-pitying idols?). The lyrics in general were nothing to write home about (urban alienation is quite a trite topic by now) and musically the album struck me as quite uninspired and conventional to my taste. I thought it was \\"standard-Brit-Pop\\" with nothing especially remarkable to offer. I was also quite baffled to hear that this was considered one of the best and most original albums ever made. I don't know how this album could have generated such a cult following. It seems that the \\"standards\\" are a bit low. If things like these are considered the height of sophistication, then, what other status should we give to experimental artists less known but far more proficient like Einst&uuml;rzende Neubauten, Suicide, David Sylvian or the abovementioned Miranda Sex Garden? There are hypes in art beyond my mind, I have no doubt about that. Well, at least I get the satisfaction and the certainty of not having missed anything outstanding concerning Radiohead all these years. No regrets.<br /><br />The reason I give this album two stars is just because it is the source of another Miranda Sex Garden's decent song. At least I grant Yorke that (or whoever wrote the lyrics). Thank You.grets. <br /> <br />The reason I give this album two stars is just because it is the source of another Miranda Sex Garden's decent song.

B00022M518|5.0|the greatness of this album lies in its variety - almost no one song sounds like another. if anything they all sound totally different and distinct (maybe due to the influences of the wide parade of musicians involved in this enterprise). eno's collaborators in this effort include phil manzaneras, robert fripp, robert wyatt etc.     the first track with as fantastic a title as \\"needle in the camel's eye\\" is considered by many to be the forerunner of alternative rock! the songs with frip - \\"baby's on fire\\", \\"blank frank\\" etc have a wicked feel to them (fripp providing an extended solo on the former). \\"cindy tells me\\" is the most melodic tune in the album which anticipates the melody of another green world. likewise with \\"some of them\\" and \\"here comes the warm jets\\". atmospherics and chorus dominates on \\"on some faraway beach\\" - where the vocals start, just when you start thinking that the track is an instrumental!     this is a great album with eno's trademark earnestness which compels you to take him seriously on even the most ridiculous subjects - as if he's some insight into things which we can't perceive. the music is not as accessible as another green world. but its charms will unfold after a few listens.     and btw dont forget to look closely at the tiny photograph below eno's larger photograph, on the album cover!
B000667FN8|1.0|i tried listing to this REALLY I tried! I dont know why some people enjoy it, thats beyond me. People love labeling things, such as this band is a emo band nothing more and nothing less, these guys can not perform punk music even they went back in time and toured with THE CLASH for several years. Its just not in them and they have absolutely no potential to even transition themselves from a whiny emo band to a hardcore punk band, SO TO ALL OF YOU PEOPLE WHO THINK SIMPLE PLAN CAN DO PUNK, THEY CAN NOT and also niether can GOOD CHARLOTE or Yellow card. Also whats the difference between these guys and good charlote NOTHING AND I MEAN NOTHING

B00000JTB2|5.0|What can you say about a man that makes stevie ray vaughan appear as the apprentice. Not only that, but stevie plays in a different space to what you would normally hear. For fans of both albert king and SRV, there is something unique and wortwhile on this CD <br /> <br />
B00005YJMX|4.0|If I had only heard of the 1922 version, and saw this version, I would be led to believe that this was in fact the original Nosferatu...thats how accurate it is.  The vampire in Nosferatu is the type of creature all horror fans want to see.  It wasn't until the 90's when Subspecies came out, that a depiction of a vampire left the old \\"Bela Lugosi\\" days and once again re-emerged as a vile and horrible creature.
B000AL730O|3.0|I am a huge Beatle fan and huge fan of the solo Beatle works.<br /><br />Everybody is gushing over this record. Quite frankly I don't know why. It starts out nicely with title track. Then songs 2 - 11 seem like one long run on sentence. What's the big deal about \\"Jenny Wren\\"? I keep hearing it's the new \\"Blackbird\\".<br /><br />Not even close. It's a good solid well recorded album. It's no \\"Paul McCartney 1970\\" It sounds like a record recorded by a grandpa, which it is.
B0009MDPYM|2.0|Alan Moore created this anti-hero in Saga of the Swamp Thing...Little did he know that his trench coat chain smoking english man would become one of the back stones to DC Comics modern Vertigo comic series...... To push John into a further realm which this movie is based apon Garth Ennis gave a new and darker gritty side to Constantine..... (most of this movie is based off of Dangerous Habits((by Ennis))  although it goes back some plots from issues 1-10 and some other various parts of the 200 plus saga of Hellbalzer....) Yet, from the word go hollywood is able to take from the simplist things and just throw it all away.  First off what was wrong with Contanine being British????  Aye, this film was overall aimed for the American audience but, when has it been bad to have a british character???? More or less never.... Americans love british people more than Keuna Reeves... Seriously Hollywood more or less had two of the best comic book writers in the last thirty years to take from on this story and they just threw it away and went with what they thought was good.....And to top it off right before this movie came out DC made an offical version of this to be adapted to comic format and still scenes were cut and made differently before it went to the big screen....As, if to just rub salt in the wound that hollywood can't even follow it's own rules... For those who know nothing of Hellblazer or Constantine this movie can be outright confusing because the director assumed you've read the comic series which was a critcal mistake because this is a rather complex character.  Not, that it's impossible to make a two hour film on a long series comic character. Look to Spider Man 1 or Conan....Both took a well know character and took the basicness of what made them good and made a good film on them....As to those who gave this movie a 5 or 4 rating regardless of what they know about hellblazer are unfortinatly idiots that think Krull was great or Ghostbusters 2..... So, if you never were thrilled with Blair Witch, Ghostbusters 2, Aliens 3 ect....than you know to stay far far away from this film.....But, if you liked matrix 3, Robocop 3, Krull than by all means rent or buy this film.....
0385338686|2.0|I was disappointed by this one - I liked \\"shopaholic\\" and \\"Can you keep the secret?\\" and expected another fun and easy reading, but in this book Kinsella tried to touch some bigger issues... well, it did not work. <br />The main character, Samantha Sweeting begins from being smart and successful, but totally overworked corporate lawyer and somehow, by series of misunderstandings, becomes to be... a housekeeper. Well, most of times I am so stressed out in my job that I am ready to be housewife... for a couple of months. OK, the story is funny, the characters are recognizable, the necessary element of romance is in... But why does she have to choose between two absolute extremes? Is there any sweet compromise that all of us - poor overworked career women - are trying to find, if not in the real life, so at least in the fiction? <br /> I can guess already that in the next couple of months - after she learns \\"Cooking Advanced\\" the woman will be royally bored in her kitchen. At least that much she should know about herself. I guess, this way Kinsella leaves herself the opportunity to develop the plot in the next book . Hopefully, the next one would be better. <br /> <br />

0060589272|5.0|I absolutely adored this book and read it in two days.  So many times I found my self getting teary-eyed as a I read Maria's diary and followed her journey of self-discovery through one of the most misunderstood and misused gifts we humans possess--sex. Paulo's ability to show the beautiful co-mingling of sex, love, loneliness and pain, his understanding of the true sex act being a prayer--a way to touch Divinity, and his ability to show the these things through characters that are enticingly human make this one of my all time favorite novels.  I love how he slips past the insignificant barriers of race, gender, nationality, language, sexual deviance and morality to present Maria's adventure as the pursuit of truth...beautiful, individual truth guided by instinct and destiny.  This is such a rich story that I would enthusastically encourage anyone with an open mind to read.  Eleven Minutes is an exploration into the things we crave most out of life presented in a way that will awaken your soul and change the way you love and make love.
B0001CNRS4|5.0|Is mine for Jessica Alba!  HONEY was filled with memorable dancers and a clutch of tunes that all sort of sound the same but have enough difference between them to disti8nghuish them-just.  Genuwine seemed like a creep because he accepted Katrina instead of Honey as a choreographer, I can't understand why Genuwine got himself talked into accepting a part which shows him to be so heartless he disappoints a whole community center's worth of little kids<br /><br />By contrast, Tweet, who doesn't seem like she has much talent, shows that at any rate she's full of heart by showing up and paying money to get into Honey's big dance benefit, even after Honey's been blackballed out of the music video business by a jealous ex lover.<br /><br />Lil Romeo showed some spunk as Benny, the little boy who would rather be a drug dealer than a dancer, for the movie<br /><br />Jessica Alba is so beautiful and sweet in this movie you can easily believe she is the daughter of Lonette McKee, once the most beautiful woman in the movies and even here, at age 50 or so, still fantastic looking.  Poor Lonette is probably wondering why she doesn't get the plum parts she used to in such films as COTTON CLUB and MALCOLM X but she's got nothing to be ashamed about!  Her fans have never forgotten her crooning \\"How Long Has This Been Going On?\\" in ROUND MIDNIGHT and we will never will!  What they should have done in HONEY is have a duet with Lonette McKee and Missy Elliott.<br /><br />Meanwhile Mekhi Phifer is adorable as the lovesick barber who clawed his way outta the gangs, and as for David Moscow (who plays Michael, the hyorndog viedo director), he was so cute in BIG and NEWSIES that we hope this turn towards sexual harassment is just a momentary aberration on his part.<br /><br />The final number, \\"I Believe,\\" is just as good as the climax \\"I Sing The Body Electric\\" in FAME.  If only Jessica Alba danced in it my happiness would be complete,<br /><br />The movie has every cliche under the sun but I wouldn't have it any other way.  I just wonder about one thing, why the head gangster (BB, played by Wes Williams), who threatens to make life miserable for Honey and Chaz doesn't do anything beyond making empty threats.  I thought at the very least he would have had one of the child gang members killed or the barber shop torched, or, well, I don't want to disappoint fellow viewers any more than we already are.der the sun but I wouldn't have it any other way.

0790731509|5.0|I've seen this movie many times and caught it on TV again this weekend, only reminding me what a classic it is, easily among the best of all time.   <br /> <br />Paul Newman plays Luke, an unbreakable spirit trapped in a place, and among men, determined to break him.  That spirit, though, is as much his strength as it is his burden.  As the story progresses, the audience comes to identify, not so much with Luke himself, but with his prisonmates.  We're in silent awe of his guts when he won't stay down in the fight scene with George Kennedy, we root for him on the edge of our seats during the oft-referenced egg eating scene, we watch with pity as he digs and fills the ditch - the guards working him to the breaking point, and we cheer like mad as he takes off in the same guards' truck, shackles be damned.   <br /> <br />It could easily be regarded as Newman's best acting.  I wouldn't disagree with that, but won't go that far myself only out of respect for his other all time great performances (e.g. The Hustler, Butch Cassidy, The Color of Money, The Verdict, and so on).   <br /> <br />Also, as a \\"prison movie\\", as much as I hate to lump this classic into such a narrow sub-genre, it is by far the best I've seen and its influence on future films of that genre, the good ones and the bad ones (e.g. Escape From Alcatraz, The Shawshank Redemption, and so on), is blatantly obvious. <br /> <br />In short . . . a classic, definitely in my personal top ten of all time.
B0001US8EO|4.0|I read that Kevin Costner and Lawrence Kasdan originally wanted WYATT EARP to be a two-part film, a grand, sweeping epic that covered a big chunk of the Wild West from Earp's childhood to his death in the 20th Century.  But the production was scaled down when news that a rival Earp project, TOMBSTONE, was also in production.<br /><br />(Bob \\"Boze\\" Bell, the editor of True West magazine, has several excellent books on Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday worth checking out).<br /><br />The big question when TOMBSTONE came out first, then WYATT EARP was: Which one do you like better?<br /><br />Well, I love the story enough to like them both.<br /><br />TOMBSTONE is more of the crowd-pleasing Western where the Good Guys vs. the Bad Guys.<br /><br />But WYATT EARP tries to dig a little deeper, aim closer to the human side of the history and legend (and how they intersect).  Wyatt didn't show up in Tombstone wearing a white cowboy hat and a shiny badge--and he certainly didn't leave that way.  Of all the movies of the gunfight at the OK Corral, WYATT EARP comes the closest to depicting the 38-second gunfight than all the others (just go to the Cochise County courthouse in Tombstone and check out the second-by-second depictions on the walls).<br /><br />And Dennis Quaid was ROBBED at award time that year.  His Doc Holliday was amazing.  He looked, as Holliday was described, \\"dead from the eyes down.\\"  Since I've always heard that the cameras add five pounds to everyone, Quaid must have looked like a ghostly apparition during the shoot.  And I've heard that a doctor was on the set every day for him.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, he's right up there with DeNiro in RAGING BULL as far as how far an actor will go to play a part.<br /><br />I've also read in these reviews complaints about Costner's performance--something I didn't have a problem with.<br /><br />After reading several Earp biographies and other books about the West and Tombstone, Costner plays him with the type of stoic remoteness that most of those accounts record.  Testimony about the OK Corral gunfight cite that Wyatt was \\"cool as cucumber\\" as he drew his gun and took careful aim before firing.<br /><br />I also really loved the music in this film.<br /><br />And I'm not the only one: for years I've heard it used in trailers for other films (along with the BRAVEHEART soundtrack), and I bought the soundtrack on CD.  Good stuff.<br /><br />I would've loved to have seen what they really wanted to do with this film.<br /><br />But I'll take it as it is.s that most of those accounts record.

B00008X5J1|4.0|In New York City in 1846, a child witnesses the violent death of his father in a gang battle between the Irish immigrant \\"Dead Rabbits\\" and the \\"Natives\\" who want the power in the city to stay with those who were born American. Ten years later, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo diCaprio) is a young man determined to avenge the death of his father years ago. He returns to lower Manhattan's \\"5 Points\\" neighborhood in search of Bill \\"The Butcher\\" Cutting (Daniel Day Lewis), the Native warlord who killed his father and still holds sway over the 5 Points. Amsterdam's intelligence and courage attract Bill's attention, and Bill invites him into the Natives' inner circle. There Amsterdam falls in love with a professional thief named Jenny (Cameron Diaz) who enjoys Bill's protection. As the years pass, the nation becomes embroiled in War, Tammany Hall's Boss Tweed seeks Bill Cutting's help to win support in the 5 points, and Amsterdam becomes a sort of surrogate son to Bill. Eventually, Amsterdam's identity is betrayed to Bill and he is forced into hiding. But Amsterdam is able to raise an army of Irishmen to challenge the Natives' power.  In 1863, the new \\"Dead Rabbits\\" and the \\"Natives\\" do battle again as Draft Riots sweep the city and New York erupts in violence and flames.<br /><br />\\"Gangs of New York \\" will probably not go down in history as one of Scorsese's masterpieces. But I really appreciate what director Martin Scorsese is trying to do in this film. \\"Gangs of New York\\"'s story of love and revenge is a little corny. But the substance of this film is found in the environment in which the characters live: The 5 Points, New York City, circa 1860. The film's theme is bold. And so you won't miss it, as it's stated in the movie's tagline:  \\"America Was Born in the Streets.\\" This nation's framework was laid in documents, with signatures, and in civil -and uncivil- debate, by wigged gentlemen in wood-paneled chambers. But the nation itself was forged in cauldrons of hate, greed, chaos, and extreme violence. And it continues to be today, as our culture  makes this nation what it is, not our lawmakers. Daniel Day Lewis gives a great performance as cunning, sociopathic, seductive Bill Cutting. Lewis has never been slimier. Jim Broadbent, as Boss Tweed, has all of the best lines in the movie and is a lot of fun to watch. If you have lived in New York City, or perhaps any city, you may recognize the roots of the city's modern politics and public services in this film. And it may make you chuckle at how little some things have changed. \\"Gangs of New York\\" is a worthwhile and entertaining lesson in social history.

The last half of the book I stayed up late to finish.  It made me laugh and the vampire sex scene was great especially when she found out why he had been interupted twice during it.  Poor Roman.  I am looking forward to a book about Gregori and his harem of female vamps.  I am also interested to know if vampires can have children.  That ought to be funny.  Can you just see little johnny getting picked on at school and him say I'll sick my daddy on you.  How do you get the kids to keep daddy's little secret?  This is a first book for this author and I can't wait to read more by her as she will just keep getting better and better.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is such a wonderful show.  You will want to watch the episodes again and again. It's a tremendous tragedy that it was cancelled.  I am so happy that they are making a movie.  I hope they make dozens of them.
B000AARKOO|4.0|Many complaints coming from critics is that KOH was too nice to the Muslims and made the Christians look like warlords... well, that's exactly how it was; the Christians did attack to retake the \\"holy land\\" and was rather nasty towards the Muslim occupants until their expulsion.  Historical nitpicking aside, KOH had it's ups and downs.<br /><br />First off, the movie was slightly long-winded and tended to drag quite a bit so at certain points it was hard to stay focused, however, the dialogue pertaining to religion and extremism was very interesting and very prevelant in our day and age; something that is often overlooked in our mainstream society today.<br /><br />The action sequences were nice; a true testiment to how sword-fighting and medieval warfare was at the time.  The scenes were not overly-grotesue but just right for the occassion so the viewer is not distracted.  The code of honor was not overdone in a hookey over-the-top style like many movies do these days.<br /><br />The acting wasn't bad either; I love Jeremy Irons and Orlanda Bloom and both played characters well suited for their styles of acting.  Some of the other actors and actresses needed a little work here and there, but that's nitpicking.<br /><br />The only real drawbacks I can find is the dragging dialogue in some scenes and not enough action.  For how long the movie is, I was hoping for more battles and less dialogue; for that, I am disapointed but will still be proud to purchase this DVD.<br /><br />All in all, an 89%.
B00000IQMT|4.0|I really love Star Wars and it's music, but the only problem I really had was episode 1 was that it had a little too much filler music. Don't get me wrong, there are still some great selections on this CD and it's certianly worth the buy. <br />Some of the songs, like \\"Jar Jar's Introduction\\", \\"Watto's Deal and Kids at Play\\", and \\"ANakin Defeats Sebulba\\", are mostly just filler music, not exactly my favorite. <br />However, when it comes to songs like \\"Duel of the Fates\\", \\"He is the Chosen One\\", \\"HIgh Council Meeting and QUi-Gon's Funeral\\", and \\"Augie's Great Municiple Band and End Credits\\", John Williams genious as a film composer comes around full swing. <br />For any die hard Star Wars fan this is a must, and even for those in doubt, just get one that's used and new. I hear they're really cheap!

0783226888|1.0|Master assassin sets up hopelessly convoluted plan to get into the US and assassinate the First Lady while master IRA soldier, who proclaims, emotionally \\"I was never a bomber!!\\" gives the FBI and the US Military its marching orders in the hunt for the bad guy.  <br /> <br />One might think it would require a convoluted plan to do this, what with the skills of the Secret Service and the military in defending our Presidential family, right? Wrong.  <br /> <br />First, the assassin is already in the US, so why not just drive his car over to the kill zone to do the job.  <br /> <br />Second, apparently, the Secret Service doesn't bother to secure a location outside of 100 yards, where Bruce Willis' huge mega-gun is set up. Why he needed that monstrosity when an average deer rifle would have worked just as well is beyond me. And can someone tell me how Sidney Poitier could possibly be the guy covering the the First lady when the bullets start flying instead of her cadre of Secret Service officers makes no sense. <br /> <br />What about the boat? Why all the ID's and country hopping, when you have a mini-van already waiting for you in the States. Why not just drive in, or ride in on a bus? Or, for pete's sake, why not just stay in the US to begin with and drive over to the local shopping mall where the First Lady was giving her speech and shoot her and walk away. Remember, the security was so non-existent that you were able to shoot off two hundred thousand rounds of ammo and no one, not one person, except the Irish terrorist, even looked in your direction as you walked to the subway. <br /> <br />And since when did the FBI need a terrorist, apparently skilled in assassin psychology and behavior as well as suicide bombing, to explain to them that if you move the First Lady off the stage the master assassin will start blasting the crowd. One would think that, if they hustled the target away, the master assassin would simply abort the mission, as he threatened to do numerous times if the slightest problem occurred. The master assassin is now attributed with the psychology of your average McDonald's mass killer, spraying bullets in every direction? <br /> <br />Why does being shot by the master assassin a dozen years ago qualify Richard Gere to know the man's psychology inside and out. If Gere is who he says, a soldier and not a killer, then would he understand what motivates Willis' character at all? <br /> <br />Jack Black. The savant technical genius who invents the vehicle-sized mega weapon but who, as another reviewer said, couldn't order a burger for himself at White Castle. Does this guy exist in the real world? <br /> <br />The End: why does the dispassionate, master assassin, when he has the drop on Gere, not just shoot him? Why does he degenerate from skilled professional killer to spur-of-moment bank robber type when he takes a hostage in the subway? Why hasn't one of perhaps ten thousand law-enforcement types in the Washington DC area  shown up in the subway after 10 solid minutes of shooting, chasing, and hostage taking?
B000641ZA4|4.0|I was actually surprised to see this DVD at the store.  I'm trying to build a large music DVD collection, so that I can get away from movies and still enjoy my surround sound with music.<br />But, Rhino can do so much more with music videos.  I'm surprised that Rhino hasn't exploited the classic music video market yet.  I'll talk more about this, before I close this review.<br /><br />After the Progressive Rock Era of Genesis (the 1970's), I didn't really follow Genesis too much in the 1980's.  Although, I have heard their hits on the radio, to me, it was just a different Genesis.  The group Yes, also changed from Progressive to Pop.<br /><br />This Genesis video collection is better than I had first thought.  I knew I wanted the \\"Land of Confusion\\" video.  That video alone compelled me to buy this DVD.  But, I was certainly surprised at all the other great videos that there are here.  Right away, I took to liking the videos of \\"Mama\\" and \\"Home By the Sea\\".  Many others will grow on me quickly, I'm sure.  So again, what I'm saying is, this video collection is far better than I expected.  I've just seen the new 3 CD collection of the best of Genesis, released by Rhino as well.  Unfortunately, they again, chose to give us edited versions of some songs and therefore, reduces the appeal of the whole collection to me.  I cannot accept the single version of \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight.\\"<br /><br />Now back to the DVD. Sure, there are no extras.  No documentaries, etc.  What would have been nice as a few extras for this DVD, would have been a few videos of the guys doing their solo hits.  Some Peter Gabriel, some Mike Rutherford, and most especially, Phil Collins.<br /><br />With Phil Collins, they could have giving us his videos of \\"In the Air Tonight\\", \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\", and maybe a few others of his more darker songs.  Then, they could go ahead and release a Phil Collins video collection with all his wimpy, schmultzy, love songs like his greatest hits CD was a few years back.<br /><br />Now, back to Rhino Home Video.  Since this is the age of the music DVD video collection, why hasn't Rhino been putting out \\"Classic MTV\\" video collections?  During the 1990's, Rhino has released music CD collections like: \\"Have a Nice Day\\" (25 volumes), \\"Didn't It Blow Your Mind\\" (20 volumes), Billboard Hits Collections (10 big hits per CD, from the 1950's, through the 1990's), \\"Rock Instrumentals\\" (5 volumes), \\"The British Invasion\\", \\"DIY\\", etc.  The list could go on and on.  Back in the mid 1990's, Rhino released a double CD collection called \\"Classic MTV: 1983\\".  Imagine if that collection were available as the DVD collection that it was meant to be.  I was surprised that Rhino only did this one CD collection.  They could have done so many more.<br /><br />So Rhino, why aren't you releasing multiple volumes of \\"One Hit Wonders\\" MTV video collections from the \\"classic MTV\\" era?  I would love to have a classic MTV library on DVD.  Something like 20 videos per DVD, year by year, all the way through the 1980's.  All the \\"One Hit Wonders\\" that we would never expect to see a whole video collection of by that specific artist released on DVD.  A Flock of Seagulls, The Art of Noise, Thomas Dolby, Missing Persons, After the Fire, a-Ha, Nena, Devo, Berlin, Ultravox, etc. etc. etc. Rhino could continuously collect pop videos and release them in the DVD format.  And built on various themes too.  To this day, it is still practically an untouched market.<br /><br />I really don't know what Rhino has been doing for the past 10 years.  I haven't been following Rhino like I use to.  Releasing \\"classic MTV\\" videos would definately put Rhino back in the forefront of today's purchasing music market.<br /><br />Rhino!

B00005JODA|5.0|awesome movie where there was something for everyone.  initially, I wanted to avoid watching this movie because it seemed too heavy and political, and being very American, all I wanted was to be entertained on a Friday afternoon, but it turned out to be a movie that I think everyone should watch.  Its thrilling, moving, funny and sad at times, and always, beautiful and inspiring.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Ghost Reveries is the best album I have heard in the last 2 years.  I can't find a single flaw on the entire album anywhere. \\"Ghosts of Perdition\\" and \\"GrandConjuration\\"are both killer songs. As with all Opeth albums there are a few long songs and a few mellow songs.  I hate Death Metal but Opeth is one of my favorite bands.  With these guys around we don't need Metallica anymore. If you aren't sure about buying this album check out Opeth's Damnation or Blackwater Park or Deliverance. You won't be disappointed. Opeth in my opinion is the new Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have heard this called the best thing ever produced for television. It seemed unlikely when I heard it, but since then, I have not been able to think of anything better.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is Michael's best CD yet!  Every song is good and his versions are super.  I bought this primarily for \\"Home\\" which I love but play the entire CD over and over.  His voice is mesmerizing!
B000002KD9|4.0|Like many, I often think of \\"Harvest\\" as THE essential Neil Young album, and it is excellent. However, every time I listen to \\"After The Gold Rush\\", I think it might just be better. The two are very similar of course. So many great songs here besides the title track. \\"Southern Man\\" was a big hit, though it's one of my least favorites. \\"Till The Morning Comes\\", \\"Don't Let It Bring You Down\\", and \\"When You Dance You Can Really Love\\" are all great cuts. \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\" is classic, and has been covered by many. One song that I didn't care for much at first was \\"I Believe In You\\", but it grew to be one of my favorites of any album. I get lost in that one, like many songs of his. After many years of listening, \\"After The Gold Rush\\" is one album in my essential Neil trilogy, along with \\"Freedom\\", and of course \\"Harvest\\".
B00005QK3W|5.0|I really enjoyed the use of instruments in this album. The upbeat feelings (where appropraite) and lyrics-to-music compilations were just brilliant to me.  <br /> <br />I am very used to hearing beautful love songs, thought provoking ballads, and fun lyrics from Paul McCartney. You certainly get a large dose in this album. <br /> <br />(I Do is my ultimate favorite-but Heather and Rinse the Raindrops come very closely behind.) <br /> <br />I am a great fan of McCartney's and I have to say that I haven't heard an album of his where I liked every song. McCarney's first album after the Beatles came close. Flaming Pie, closer. But Driving Rain finally did it for me. Excellent. Absolutely.   <br /> <br />
B000002KZ6|2.0|Except for the last track, this record is severely limited by sterile studio production and performance. For a glimpse at the real potential of what Talking Heads and these songs are capable of, check out the live video Stop Making Sense.
B000AL730O|5.0|This isn't a rock album that's why some here are disappointed...here is the recipe. <br /> <br />1. Take Pauls slow to mid tempo stuff off the White album(Blackbird, I will, mother natures son. etc) and use it as a base <br />2. add a touch of side 2 from Abbey Road <br />3. add some earlier Wings (but filter out the sappy stuff) <br />4. throw in the homemade sound of his Solo debut \\"McCartney\\" <br />5. add some classical and music hall sound <br />6. shake and bake and let Nigel Polish it up <br /> <br />This isn't a record you can just pop in the CD player and go do chores..its one you listen too with headphones on a rainy day and reflect on your life <br /> <br />Listen...LISTEN to it...the clever arrangments..Pauls Classic bass sound,  the different directions, the classical parts <br /> <br />In fact if it was just an intrumental album it still would be good.   <br /> <br />At 63 Pauls voice is past peak, but it  fits in nicely here with the more dark and glommy atmosphere <br /> <br />The Album will grow on you.. <br />
B00024I2Z4|3.0|Note that the three stars is for the DVD, not the film. While it's not quite The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast, I'd still give Mulan five stars just for the powerfully dramatic story and the message that, if I had little girls, I'd definitely want them to get from this movie. <br /> <br />However, \\"Special Edition\\" is not my preferred term for this DVD. Mulan's \\"Special Edition\\" got basically the same treatment that The Lion King's \\"Platinum Edition\\" got - crap. Sorry, but a bunch of featurettes do not equal a real, cohesive \\"making-of\\" documentary. And the lack of theatrical trailers, at one time the sole bonus feature of a DVD, is inexcusable. DVDs with little or NO bonuses often at least include a trailer. I wouldn't have even spent money, but the transfer is top notch, in anamorphic widescreen, and that was worth the $10 I was able to get it for at Wal Mart. (I'm pretty sure it's not that cheap anymore, it was a limited-time only sale.) <br /> <br />I didn't quite expect Platinum Edition treatment, so it didn't disappoint me like when I found out the specs for The Lion King, as it WAS a Platinum Edition and should have been handled better. But even the current 2-disc Pocahontas 10th Anniversary Edition and the now OOP Sleeping Beauty 2-Disc Special Edition managed to recycle an old making-of documentary to go with the other little featurettes on various things AND managed to include 2-3 theatrical trailers. <br /> <br />If you only care about the movie and not the bonuses, definitely buy this. It's the only version of the movie in print, and rightfully so as the picture and sound are top notch. However, if you also like DVDs with great bonuses, I can't fully recommend this DVD. Unfortunately, I have to give this product 3 stars. It would be two stars except the movie is just so good and given to us in such a wonderful presentation that it earns this DVD another star.
0694003611|5.0|I love reading this book to my niece at bedtime, and she loves hearing it! It's soothing, comforting, and is just the most lovely story that any child would love. My favorite part is reading it. It's one of the best for a soothing bedtime story that I've found.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|did anyone do an accent count?i counted 4 and not one of them was greek(pitt made up his own accent).my gripes;I AM THOROUGHLY SICK OF BLOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!HAS HE GOT SOME SICK SWASH BUCKLERS FETISH/OBSESSION OR SOMETHING?!?!?his part was fitting(a coward) but still annoying.the battle scenes were very good and the acting wasnt overly cheesy.im also tired of women playing the weeping maidens who cower in the background.there was also a line that irked me as well - young boy to achilles;''the enemy youre about to fight,i wouldnt want to.''(not verbatim).  ahilles response - ''thats why no one will remember your name.''.sounds cool but theres more ways of making a name for ones self other than killing.the music was sorta goofy.all in all,its an ok movie and is not boring.i wasnt expecting much else.
B00004WG2X|5.0|I don't know if I can add anything here that hasn't already been said. I've watched the A&E version, and was so disappointed with it...and puzzled by its popularity. Colin Firth's portrayal of Darcy came across, to me, as embarrassingly wimpy. Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth seemed abrasive. The other characters were reduced to caricatures. The modernized, abridged dialogue and the addition of scenes not in the book only made the whole movie seem like a forgettable 20th-century soap opera not particularly well acted and inexplicably featuring early 19th-century clothes. <br /> <br />By contrast, in this version, David Rintoul captures Darcy so perfectly, a mixture of arrogance, pride, sexual charisma, and under the surface, something more. When my sisters and I watched this movie on TV back in the '80s, we were so taken with him that we read the novel! And Elizabeth Garvie portrays Elizabeth Bennet so faithfully, it's hard to imagine anyone outdoing her. The sparks between her and Rintoul are palpable. And each of the other characters is so well acted, with dialogue so well adapted from the novel, that you can watch this video over and over again and notice something different each time. The whole production sparkles! <br /> <br />However, in fairness, I have to say that the BBC version is very like the book in unfolding slowly (at first) and having a lot of dialogue. If you prefer a story that moves at a uniformly fast pace with less dialogue, you may prefer the A&E version. Otherwise, this is the P&P movie to see! <br />
B0009VRHLK|1.0|......and thats putting people to sleep.i wanted to fast forward to chloes slurpy but i wanted to give this an honest shot.well,as i typed up top,i was falling asleep within the first 20 minutes.at minute number 21,i had to give in and fast forward.the reason for EVERYONE to buy,or as i did,rent this was so/so.chloe did a nose dive in gallos lap.wow!for the geeks who rave about the dullness,i can only assume they are somehow in debted to gall-o and this is their way of paying him back.for the males who love this,they need girlfriends in thier lives.the geeks equate nothing happening as ''tragic'' self internalizing.the eegheads have to invent thier own scenarios to justify raving about this slop.in closing,yet another gimmick is ''exposed'' as being just that,A GIMMICK!and its true,chloes shaft inspection isnt the only thing that sucks in this.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Rashamon is an incredibly influential film.  In 1951 it seemed odd indeed with its five points of view, it's camera movement, it's melancholy theme, rape and murder.  There is also a self-mocking element to the Samurai sword fighting and Kimono doll histrionics.  The overacting is actually snide sarcasm about Japanese film or societal convention.  Japanese film folks were surprised Western viewers grasped these ideas.  After all, American Westerns have their formal rituals, the gunfight at noon, the horsy loner, and so on.  12th Century Samurai and their sword fighting, the status of women in Japan, their victimization, all is standard film fare in the East.   <br /> <br />This one is a thoughtful film with interesting, original cinematography, but for those looking for huge battles as shown in the later Ran, this one is a Perry Mason court case.  <br />
B000819PKC|5.0|Extremely good 6th album by the acid-jazz funk band Jamiroquai. Don't be mislead by Feels Just Like It Should! That, and black devil car are the only commercialized rocky songs. SDISJ is a very mellow toned down song, whereas starchild and Dont give hate chance are upbeat and lively. electric mistress and loveblind are discofied electronic synth, tallulah and world he wants are very slow ballads. Basically an extremely well varied cd and worth buying!
1932100385|5.0|I found this book to be very informative, thorough and easy to follow, however, I was looking for a book on how to eat healthier and was unaware till chapter 1 that this book is simply a how to become a vegetarian for life book so if that is not your goal, you may want to keep searching. I just love steak too much to give it up.
0966638328|1.0|I found that the definition of tertiary colors on the 10th page of the book is wrong. As tertiary colors are a combination of primary and secondary colors, and not a combination of secondary colors only as the book has mentioned.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Yes this is an excellent album. And yes Audioslave lives up to their self titled debut. Sophomore efforts can be disasters, they can also be an indicator of the true staying power of a band. I'm a huge Audioslave fan as are many who were once fans of Sound Garden and Rage Against the Machine. The writing on this album is sharp and of the highest quality in present day Alt Rock. Every single tune has been crafted with care and heart, because they wouldn't have it any other way. And it's true, this album is less hard than \\"Audioslave\\". But fortunatley it does not work to Out of Exile's detriment. Actually it's the opposite, and Audioslave sounds more matured than ever. Audioslave is consistent and it's what will sell their albums for years to come. Every song is great. The best song on this record is \\"Dandelion\\", it's unbelievably entertaining. Especially the quieter, softer parts of the tune. Sort of a throwback to the 60's vibe. Audioslave further legitimizes itself as the best thing to happen to the genre since the 90's. A combination of veteran talent creates one of the greatest sophomore efforts of the new millenium.
0345350499|4.0|I admit going into this review that I am a purist when it comes to the Arthurian stories. I like versions of the legends with more traditional tales where the major figures are in something like their more typically assigned roles. But I do find room in my soul for a book that slants the familiar and beloved Arthurian stories into another direction. This is the rise and fall of a King, as told from the perspective of the women who were there: mother, sister, wife. It is a novel that relies heavily on mystical themes and sets its banner down smack into the Celtic side of the era. The priestesses of the magical island of Avalon figure heavily into this novel, and the message is one of multiple tragedies: the fall of Arthur, true, but outweighing that, the loss of the earth goddess sect who gives way to the intrusions of male-oriented Christianity. After peacefully overseeing Britain through millennia, the age of the goddess and her clerics is ending, and the transition is an uneasy one. This is not the mainstream story of Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table, nor is it a version that sets \\"Morgan Le Fey\\" down as the villain responsible for the ruination of a great king and his kingdom. Marion Zimmer Bradley is an inventive woman and her novel reflects that in every word. The tone here is arcane, and by stepping into the world of The Mists of Avalon, you are clearly leaving behind the familiar and escaping into a past that confronts those who seek to resist its allure. This is escapism at its best. It is a re-telling of almost sacred mythology, and it is a story at times familiar and at others wholly new. In Zimmer Bradley's hands, the mists are crossed and an attentive reader can discover a primeval Britain where enchantment was the order of the day.
B00009V7P8|5.0|<br />in times like this where music gets more and more mechanical, boring,becoming a tool to make money;Damien Rice's great home made album \\"o\\" is a perfect escape. <br /> <br />All those guitars,violins,vocals;lyrics;they're all bittersweet and so beautifull;that you'll feel like you are listening smtg so fresh,much more real than the crap you are used to see on mtv; and it'll make you desperately want to fall in love or love more if you're already fallen.t's like washing your face with cold water when you wake up to a cloudy,cool morning after a rainy night. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This is Death Cab for Cutie's best album! After listening to the first song you wonder if all the songs could possibly be this good, and you later find out half way through the album that it is true, all the songs are great!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I just love the music, the lyrics... everything! Some songs are like modern opera, and the music like a rock'n roll sonata! They remind me of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" but with a controversial twist. <br />I always liked Green Day... on the radio, never enough to buy a CD... but after this work of contemporary art, I'll pay more atention to their work!  <br />
B00008ADPF|5.0|Reading these reviews really makes me want to go on the deffensive. The simple fact is Nickelback has a grit and a sound that tops them all right now and the sales prove it. Try it for yourself. It comes highly recommended here!!!
B000AL730O|2.0|McCartney hasn't put out anything relevant or memorable since \\"Band on the Run.\\"  That was 32 years ago, and sadly he should have quit while he was ahead.  It's too bad that his reputation has been sullied by \\"Silly Love Songs,\\" \\"Let Em In,\\"  \\"Goodnight Tonight,\\" \\"Say Say Say,\\" etc. <br /> <br />Sorry Paul, this newest album may be a critical favorite (what are THEY smoking?), but radio and the public won't bite.  Boring, unimaginative lyrics and melodies.
B0002EXH5O|4.0|Let me say right up front that I have no opinion on the \\"did the remasters include new vocals\\" question; I never owned the original recording.  So I don't know, and frankly, don't care.<br /><br />I'd call this the last \\"classic Megadeth\\" album, and it's one of my favorites from them.  The songs and riffs are intricate, the sound heavy, although the production is not up to the high standards of Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia.<br /><br />There are some really cool riffs on this record.  Mustaine is a master of heavy rhythm playing, and I like Marty Friedman's lead work.  Best songs on this, IMO are Holy Wars..., Hanger 18, Lucretia, and Rust In Peace...Polaris.  The only thing that bothers me about the album is Mustaine's vocals aren't that great on some tracks.  If he did re-record vocals for the remasters, he should have tried a few more take, IMO.  Even so, Mustaine's vocals have a tongue-in-cheek charm to them, so I can overlook that.<br /><br />If you're a Chris Poland fan, you'll be interested in the demo tracks with him on them.  I like Chris Poland, but the production quality on the tracks is poor (they're demos, after all).  Still worth a listen, especially if you prefer Poland's lead work.
B00078XGRO|5.0|A definite high point in the film series. My personal favorite. The \\"Next Generation\\" cast takes over the franchise with absolute grace. Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score was sorely overlooked for an Academy Award nomination. The film is skillfully directed by Jonathan Frakes and the actors really get a chance to shine. Appealing to the non-Trekker as well. The Special Collector's Edition DVD improves on the widescreen transfer of the original DVD print.
B000001G89|5.0|\\"Carmen\\" has become one of the most popular operas in the repertoire since its premier in Paris in 1875.  It was received coolly at first, but Bizet had received a nice payment for the publishing rights and it received 37 performances (the composer, however, died after the 31st performance at 36 years old).  This opera has an interesting performance history as well as a very unusual plot and musical treatment.<br /><br />First of all, do not be deceived by its classification as opera comique.  This is a stylistic category because there is some spoken dialogue rather than using recitative.  However, for performances outside France, it was supplied with recitative (not by Bizet, because he had died).  This performance uses a \\"restored\\" score and does not use recitative for those passages.<br /><br />How should the role of Carmen be played?  First, think about whom she is playing against.  The male protagonist, Don Jose, is not a hero.  Once he becomes enflamed by Carmen, he spirals into worse and worse behavior.  These two never become of one heart or even genuinely in love.  This is not a traditional love story.  There are no heroes or even a clearly defined bad guy.  Well, Don Jose is a bad guy, but he is also the male lead and doesn't really fill the role of a villain in the traditional sense.<br /><br />The issue for playing Carmen is what kind of gypsy do you believe her to be?  She is certainly flirtatious, fierce, and will not be possessed.  Nowadays, we tend to admire her fierce independence rather than being shocked by it.  Her casualness towards love and sex can still shock and trouble those who believe in more traditional values.  Still, this Carmen, Teresa Berganza, sees a certain dignity and propriety in her and plays her with a national pride.  She is Spanish and refused to play Carmen as a French caricature of a Spanish gypsy.  This is not how Carmen is often seen.  It is easier to excite the audience with a more erotic (lurid) performance.<br /><br />The singing here is very fine with Berganza as Carmen, Placido Domingo as Don Jose, and Sherrill Milnes as Escamillo.  This recording was made after this cast (largely) performed the opera as part of the 1977 Edinburgh Festival.  It sounds great.  The notes are helpful and the libretto is provided in the original French with an English translation by its side.<br /><br />This is Bizet's masterpiece, has many familiar tunes, and much other fine music.  \\"Carmen\\" is an opera that anyone can enjoy and for a variety of good reasons.ith Berganza as Carmen, Placido Domingo as Don Jose, and Sherrill Milnes as Escamillo.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|For anyone that came into this movie looking for immediate superhero and super villain appearances, please don't be disappointed. Batman Begins takes the character back to his origin, and portrays what drives the man behind the cape. The excitement throughout is incredible as you know what this is building up to, but the ride beforehand is fabulous. Adding Ra's Al Ghul to the early days was a nice touch, but not the original plot. From the comic book historical reference though, it fit quite well. Add to this the Scarecrow character who in a twisted way is assisting in the conquest of Gotham as part of the Ra's Al Ghul plan, and you have a film that sticks very close to the roots of a dark but heroic character. If you favor the Batman comics and the stories that accompany them, this is your film!
B000003C4K|5.0|I'm in my 50's and since in my teens,I've always loved the hardest rock at the time.My taste has run from the Yardbirds to Disturbed.But I never heard THE HARDEST rock album ever until I stumbled onto BBB in 2004(almost 20 yrs after it's release)This album makes me wish my stereo had a million watts per channel,because I'd like to hear this SO LOUD my ears would bleed.Believe me,if you like music as brutal as it gets,this has no equal!!
0446530891|5.0|Very very good.  Kept me intrigued from beginning to end.  Didn't know who the killer was till the last pages.  A great mystery and a great author.
1400032717|5.0|Several family members have read the book andone or two are rereading it.  Wonderful book.
B000AL730O|4.0|The fact that this unusual piece of work came out just two days after 50th birthday (and my twin bro's), and seven months after the death of my mother, who \\"got\\" my siblings' obsession with the Fab Four, is hardly a coincidence. It is a tremendous gift from \\"somebody out there.\\" I think my twin brother no longer feels quite the affection I do for \\"Paulie\\" anymore, but the last time he saw him live, he was stomping and weeping with joy along with the rest of the crowd, which included his son.<br /><br />In the final cut, \\"Anyway,\\" you can hear some of the driving beat of \\"Why Don't We Do it in the Road,\\" and echoes of \\"Strawberry Fields,\\" just enough to tease your memory, but at the same time, in a WHOLE NEW SOUND, with that silly \\"play me backwards,\\" theme that we all got into when the big rumor came out that \\"Paul was dead!\\" VERY clever poke at us boomers. Anyone expecting to hear Wings will be disappointed, but pleasantly surprised. Not to say that you will be bowled over, either. The unmistakable, rockin' pounding of Paul at the keyboard hasn't changed in over 40 years. It is clear that he is restraining himself from sounding over-ebulliant, and the result is quite good. \\"How Kind of You\\" is vague as to who the subject of the song is, but still haunting. \\"Jenny Wren\\" immediately brings \\"Blackbird\\" to mind. \\"At the Mercy,\\" is a 21st century version, in quiet tones, of \\"A Hard Day's Night.\\" The lovely, sad beginning to \\"English Tea\\" led to initial disappointment for me, who wanted a good song to cry to, but is ultimately fun, if too much like \\"Savoy Truffle.\\" I would have liked Charlie Chaplin's \\"Smile\\" to be played in counterpoint to \\"Too Much Rain;\\" now THAT would have been interesting. \\"A Certain Softness\\" is a sensuous love song, like a rumba. \\"Vanity Fair\\" is perhaps the biggest departure for Paul on the entire CD. He takes a giant leap and tries a TOTALLY different sound and succeeds. It lingers in the mind long afterward. Not so \\"Follow Me:\\" too Wingish. The BEST cut is the last: \\"Promise to You, Girl,\\" where we hear some of the old, jaunty Paul, and we can forgive the \\"Queen-like\\" background vocals thanks to a rockin' backdrop. Best of all: Paul channels George Harrison in a fantastic guitar solo.ut is the last: \\"Promise to You, Girl,\\" where we hear some of the old, jaunty Paul, and we can forgive the \\"Queen-like\\" background vocals thanks to a rockin' backdrop.

B000AL730O|1.0|McCarthney comes from a well known and storied past that makes us all curious about his next release.  \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" lacks the color and texture of some of his better work.   It does not help that he is the major or at times the sole musician on its songs.  Some are promising yet as a collection do not feel fully developed.   Disappointing work from an incredibily talented man.  I just expected more.
0679882820|5.0|I read this book to all my children, the oldest is now 34. It is fun and easy to read. My children were all early readers who learned to love books. I thank Dr. Suess for creating such interesting characters. Dr. Suess's ABC is another one of my favorites. I am now reading these wonderful books to my grandkids and they enjoy them just as much as my children did. A childs library isn't complete without these wonderful books!
B0000AR8NK|5.0|I bought this disc as my birthday present. I overlooked it for months, and finally I bought it: \\"It is Bowie, it will last 50 minutes, and it is gonna be cool!\\" I said. Besides that, I wanted to see what Bowie had been doing, after missing \\"Heathen\\".  <br /> <br />To this day, this is my favorite Bowie disc. The first songs, particularly the first one ( New Killer Star ) and the third one ( Never Get Old ) are awesome, and I sing them all the time: catchy, powerful, fresh and deep. Then comes \\"The loneliest guy\\", which I feel is like a hangover after the presumptuous \\"Never get old\\" , with its teenage-look-of-life ( like \\"Boys keep swinging\\" but darker). The loneliest guy starts from NGO, without any pause, as if they form an unity.  <br /> <br />Then the disc gives you some other good tunes. I like the lyrics on this one, specially \\"She'll drive the Big Car\\", about a sad wife who tries to go away with her lover but is left down. So she gotta go back to the life she hates, and of course she is angry and frustrated. Very interesting lyrics.  <br /> <br />By the way, this is one of the very few Bowie discs that includes the lyrics in the booklet. The artwork is good too.  <br /> <br />My complaint would be the the title song. It is like hearing Guns n' Roses's \\"You could be mine\\". It is not bad, but after hearing soft love songs like \\"Days\\" or \\"Try some, buy some\\", it kinda catches you with your guard down. Bowie himself seems to scream more than sing, adding to the somewhat shocking effect of the song. But with time it grows on me. <br /> <br />The album closes with \\"Bring me the Disco King\\", the longest song of the collection. I love it, it is so Blues or even Jazz, reminds me of the old Bowie (Black Tie White Noise ) <br /> <br />As a final word, an excellent Bowie disc that made me go and buy \\"Heathen\\", the album he released before this one.
B000053GTF|5.0|One would have had to live in a cave not to know \\"the extaordinary voice\\" of Celine - so powerful and strong and yet capable of great commitment to her audiences and music.  There are a few performers who simply are recognized by \\"one name\\":  Elvis, Sinatra, Barbara and Celine.  Her name alone tells people here is a very wonderful singer.  I chose this CD/DVD package because the combination gave me the opportunity to hear/see all the songs on the CD.  Few singers have produced a more beautiful and elequent DVD/CD all in one package.  It is also available in CD form alone, which is less expensive (but not by much).  It is worth the extra couple dollars for the CD/DVD combination.  One this CD/DVD are the BEST songs Celine has produced:  \\"The Power of Love\\", \\"Because You Loved Me\\", \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\", \\"My Heart Will Go On\\", and \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" are all exquisite.  However, when you see her performing these songs, NO ONE can give the gift of song to an audience better.  Because of the combination CD/DVD, I suggest if you want a BEST HITS of Celine, this is the one for you.  Get the combination CD/DVD.  You won't regret the purchase.  FIVE STARS RATING !!
B00005MP58|5.0|I have avidly watched this film series over and over - it is that well done. While it seems that Jane Austen's novel has been repeatedly re-made for film, to date there are none that capture the feel of the period nor possess the chemistry between characters as this version starring among many other greats, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. Although this film is not one of \\"action and adventure\\" as the modernized world would expect, it indeed is active with intellectual subtext and an engaging dialogue throughout. It is wonderful and in my opinion sets an example for current film producers that \\"trash and dazzle\\" need not be the standard! Indeed, there are many in the world that much prefer a well staged, well executed and engineered film - complete with the dramatic backdrops and \\"in the moment feel\\" that give the viewer the experience of society during this historical time period. If you wish to give a gift to someone in film, this is an excellent choice for it offends no one, is endearing, intelligent and extremely well done.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Well, they've done it again--even Jane Austen would be proud.  The movie's adherence to the book is refreshing but the movie adds so much more.  Hinds and Root have a great electric charge which makes them a joy to watch.  The movie does such an excellent job of making the audience wait and wait and wait for any sight or word of the Captain that we truly feel the plight of our poor heroine.  Her life is one of domesticity and sequestered emotions.  On the surface all is placid, but beneath beats a tortured heart and mind.  Through the movie's smooth pace, its music, scenery, and script we are able to feel these emotions as Anne does and so we all go on a journey together.
0553208845|5.0|I'm not surprised that this book was published in 1971 and it's still selling strong. I agree with other reviewers who think it's therapeutic. Like them, I was struggling with a problem when I read it and advice in the book helped me put the matter in proper perspective. I truly rely on the Bible for day-to-day living, but it's always good to read other encouraging, optimistic material. I believe this book has helped many people find their way in life. It will never take the place of the truth in the Bible, but it explains things in simple terms that are very helpful.
B000002KEV|5.0|Those of us who spent time in the military during the Viet Nam conflict will remember this as one of the premier \\"Albums\\" of it's time since music was one of the few forms of entertainment available to us overseas.  Hearing Smoke On the Water for the first time is something special and unforgettable.  The music stays with you.  Although it's been more than thirty years since I first heard the music, I still enjoy it. <br /> <br />This is classic music from my generation, but many younger listeners might appreciate it.
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd's final true album with bassist/lead songwriter Roger Waters, The Wall is on a peak above any other concept album written prior or post. Cheifly penned and composed by Waters, The Wall intends (and delivers) on providing a conceptual groundwork as a sort of map for the music, the story of a rock musician (aptly named \\"Pink\\")'s slow descent into insanity, citing various \\"bricks\\" (his mother, education, absence of paternal presence), which are combined to form a Wall for Pink, a seperation from society and cultured life. The second half of the album focuses on Pink's follies with drugs, beginning with self-hatred and loathing, hallucinations about his father and the war, and being drugged up in order to perform a concert. Hallucinating wildly, Pink imagines himself a fascist dictatior, cynically delivering the next three songs. Finally, when all hope nearly fails, Pink commits to putting himself on trial for his social crimes. This story, while I may be reiterating it for the upteenth time, remains one of my favourite aspects of the album, and is essential to truly appreciating the music. <br /> <br />The primary consideration, of course, is the music itself. Floyd are able to create intense textures as well as maniaclly pounding rock songs. Several tracks are short, and are meant as segues into subseqent songs. Standout rock compositions include, but are by no means limited to: Comfortably Numb, Run like Hell, Young Lust, and the wildly progressive One of My Turns. Other, more ambient pieces are epic in their own right, and allow for Gilmour's guitar work to stand out in a way that it hasn't since the classic Wish You Were Here album. <br /> <br />The Wall is an album that has been (and will be) enjoyed for generations, and possesses a demanding longevity that will not be ignored. You should buy it, if you have not already (After all, it is 23 times platinum!) :-) <br /> <br />Favourite songs: Comfortably Numb, Another Brick in the Wall (Pt.1), Run like Hell, Waiting for the Worms, The Trial. <br /> <br />5 Stars
B000AL730O|1.0|Since 1989, there has been a pattern with McCartney's solo albums: \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\" was weak, \\"Off the Ground\\" was strong, \\"Flaming Pie\\" was weak, \\"Run Devil Run\\" was strong, and \\"Driving Rain\\" was weak.  For the past 4 years, I've been waiting for Macca to redeem himself.  Upon listening to his new album, I can honestly say that the pattern has been broken...and NOT in a good way.  \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" is extremely weak.  The fact that someone can play multiple instruments doesn't necessarily mean that they should; Macca should stick to what he does best - bass guitar and writing upbeat songs.  Also, he should get off that blasted acoustic guitar for every bloody new thing he writes; it's waaaaaaay overdone.  I know the man is 63 years old, but that's no excuse to be lame.  Hell, look at the Rolling Stones - they're old but they still play electric; Macca should take some lessons from them to learn how to rock past 60 years of age.  Since meeting Heather (the equivalent to Yoko in my opinion), it's evident McCartney has become whipped and his music has tremendously suffered.   <br /> <br />Five important tips to making a good album:  <br />#1, \\"Don't play everything yourself.\\"  Overdubbing tracks leaves no room for spontaneous improvisation. <br />#2, \\"Have a full band.\\"  This is good for different creative ideas and output. Also, see tip #1 regarding spontaneous improvisation. <br />#3, \\"Don't ASSUME you know what the fans would like.\\" <br />#4, \\"Keep with a formula that works - don't branch out into left field; chances are, you'll lose most people.\\" <br />#5, \\"If the band line-up MUST change, at least keep a strong nucleus.\\"  Case and point: Paul, Linda, and Denny Laine during the Wings years.  Completely changing band members every few years has proven more often than not to be detramental. <br /> <br />Since \\"Off the Ground\\" in 1993, I've been buying his albums, but I'm so dissapointed in this one, I'm gonna pass.  His last album [\\"DrivingRain\\"] was so sappy, it put trees to shame.  I've been waiting 4 years for a redemption and apparently, I'm still gonna have to wait.  This is not the Paul McCartney we've grown to love, folks.  To be honest, this album sounds like someone's poor attempt to emulate Paul.  It crashes and burns while we listen to it and suffer.
B000050HTO|5.0|Okay, admittedly a difficult task winnowing Dylan's catalog down to 30 \\"essential\\" songs, but leaving off I Want You, perhaps his most rollicking and joyful song, is enough of an oversight to keep me from buying this collection. Start with Greatest Hits and Greatest Hits Volume 2 instead.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|I've been a huge fan of this show since it premired in Sept. 1994 up until it's run in May 2004.  As a fan, I've been collecting the season box sets since they came out back a few years ago.  Those of you that are like me remember that when the first 3 seasons came out they went for a whopping $50 to $60 dollars a piece.  With that in mind, it kinda sucks that we've had to pay more for being loyal fans of the show and kind of punishing us as the consumer for getting these box sets sooner.  I've seen pictures of the new box set for all ten seasons and it's gorgeous.  It would look really nice in anyone's collection including my own but for us that have the box sets already, I could kind of see a compromise being an option like a coupon or discounted price for proof of purchase for those of us that have them already.  Or possibilly, the extra disc and the box of the new set to be sold or redeemed seperately.  I would hope that Warner Bros. would see my post and maybe consider this option for not just myself but the rest of us who have stayed loyal to their merchandise and products for years.  I gave this box set five stars because it's a great idea but for every pro, their is a con.  So, if nothing changes I guess it will be up to the consumer what he or she wants to do.  As for myself, we'll see what the next couple of months holds in store since other shows are doing the same thing like Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Sex & The City (other shows that are doing a simular tactic like this one).
B000AL730O|1.0|It's interesting how this CD can generate so many five star reviews and plenty of 1 star reviews.  I took a chance and bought this- after all, I have every Paul CD and then some.  After several listens, I just had to read these 5 star reviews again.  Are these folks listening to the same CD I am?  I get the feeling these 5 star reviewers would basically rate anything by Paul 5 stars. I'm a huge fan, but this CD is extremely boring.  If it wasn't Paul, I'd never listen to it again.  I won't bother with the song by song analysis, because frankly, they all sound the same.  Nothing memorable.  Comments about this being \\"dentist-office muzak\\" are right on the mark.  I can only hope his next is better.
B000AL730O|5.0|Reviewers and critics around the world who have tagged Paul McCartney with the \\"Silly Love Songs\\" label must be choking on their words.  The former Beatle's new CD is an astonishingly deep and introspective piece of work, and may well be the best solo work he's ever done.  Certainly \\"Chaos\\" belongs in the same league as \\"Band On The Run\\", \\"Tug of War\\", and \\"Flaming Pie\\".  But what sets this offering apart from all of those is the tone McCartney adopts.  Whether it be his advancing years or the influence of a new producer, Paul has dug deep into himself, and offered up pieces of his soul.  Songs like \\"Jenny Wren\\" show that the man who has written some of the greatest songs of our time is still capable of magic.  The first single, \\"Fine Line\\", is actually the most pop-oriented song on the album.  The rest is a fascinating, mezmorizing listen.  One wonders if McCartney has always written songs this good, over the past 20 years?  And if so, did they just get left on the cutting room floor?  Perhaps Nigel Goderich deserves credit for steering Sir Paul in the right direction.  But producers cannot engineer genius.  They can only coax it out...such as on this CD.  Who new they still made music this good?
B0006IUDXA|5.0|This is a great package of some classic MacGyver episodes.  Anybody who likes to use their minds to solve puzzels will like this.
B000002AZ8|4.0|This album got tons of buzz when it was released, lots of which was over the band eating the additional cost of the CD layout/packaging (what artist/band would do that today?).  Pearl Jam is an ever evolving band and each album is a bit of a departure from the previous, as is the case here.  However, PJ still lays down some very solid tracks and will please all fans of Pearl Jam and rock.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|This album is the biggest disappointment of the year. I loved Waking the Fallen and it seemed like A7X was going to be a big name on the metal scene. And now they are. And it seems like they just waited to achieve a certain level of stardom so they could sell out worse than any metal band I can think of in recent years. This album is garbage, and don't listen to anyone who says it is good because they obviously know nothing about music. I'm no elitist, trust me. But this album is undeniably terrible and nothing like the A7X we have all known from before.
B000002H97|5.0|This is Metallica's last great album which contains some great material. <br />Ignore the haters and give it a whirl.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Alright, people have to stop complaining that 30 seconds changed their sound, cuz if they looked past the fact that this doesn't sound like their first cd, they will find an amazingly catchy and melodic rock album. Yes, they have changed, but not so much that they aren't 30 seconds to mars anymore. Besides, if they hadn't changed their sound, everyone would be complaining that they sound the same and that that style of music died back in 2002. I guess you can't please everyone. I think they made the right choice. The musicianship is very good, they still create sort of a creepy space sound, maybe not quite as much, but you can still hear it, but I think that it is Leto's voice that sets this band apart. His voice perfectly fit the ethereal sound that 30 seconds sets in all their songs. I was very hesitant to buy this album at first, even though I was a huge fan of their first CD, because of all the bad reviews, but I am so glad I did.I had almost given up on rock music since it seems that almost every new band is punk, but 30 seconds have put out another great CD and still remain one of my favorite rock bands of all time.
0192838679|5.0|This is probably my favourite classic novel of all time and deserves more than 5 stars. When I read it I was totaly blown away by it's genius. The Christoper Hampton play is excellent and the film based on it \\"Dangerous Liasons\\" is also very good, but the novel is even better. Which is unusual since it's when a film version is made that the story really comes alive for the reader not the other way round. The way it is written as a collection of what seems like real life letters revealing a scandal, that have been passed around members of society and finaly published makes you feel almost a part of the story.  Being  about a page and half long each, they are as if designed to read on the bus or tube despite being written in 1792!. It is very easy to pick up and put down again without losing the thread of the story. Laclos seems to know exactly how to pace and order the letters to maintain maximum interest and suspense from the beginning right through to the very end allowing the story to unfold at exactly the right moment. And even though I was very familiar with the plot I still never knew quite was going to happen next. The plot is remarkable and very famous so I wont go into it, but if you like it the novel is a must.
B000AARKW6|4.0|There was a lot of anticipation when Carlito's Way was released in 1993. Director Brian De Palma had just come off a lukewarm reception for yet another Hitchcock homage, Raising Cain and was in need of a hit to appease the studios. And so, a re-teaming with Al Pacino in an effort to recreate the magic of Scarface made commercial sense. Carlito's Way was much more sombre in tone than the cinematic shotgun blast that is Scarface. It is a tragedy about how a criminal tries to go straight but is ultimately doomed from the get-go. This is the third version of the DVD, timed to coincide with the direct-to-video release of the prequel, but is it worth purchasing if you already own one of the previous incarnations?<br /><br />Carlito is a role tailor-made for Al Pacino, allowing him to essay another larger-than-life character. Carlito is a smart guy who cannot escape what he is no matter how hard he tries and Pacino conveys the melancholy that lurks behind the bravado of his character. The real scene stealer, however, is Sean Penn's sleazy, coked-up lawyer. The actor reportedly did the film to help finance his directorial debut, The Crossing Guard. For a paycheck role, Penn does a great job as he disappears into the character, complete with a frizzy afro and cheap suits. It's almost as if Pacino's presence inspired Penn to step up his game. And this makes Penn's memorable turn so much fun to watch.<br /><br />\\"Brian De Palma on Carlito's Way\\" features the director criticizing the current crop of movies that merely copy or quote from other movies or TV shows (Tarantino anyone?) and don't draw from real life. De Palma puts a lot of thought into the visuals of his movies in an attempt to surprise the audience. He goes on to slam film critics who don't like visual filmmakers and then, in an act of typical hubris, compares himself to Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />There are nine deleted scenes totaling eight minutes. There are a lot of extensions of existing scenes that feature some nice moments between characters (like one between Pacino and Penn).<br /><br />Included from the previously released \\"Collector's Edition\\" is \\"The Making of Carlito's Way,\\" a 34 minute retrospective featurette. Sadly, Pacino and Penn are not present for this featurette that is nonetheless informative and well-made.<br /><br />Also included from the \\"Collector's Edition\\" is a \\"Photo and Poster Gallery\\" that features some really cool poster designs, stills from the movie and some of De Palma.<br /><br />\\"Original Promotional Featurette\\" was done back in the day and is more like a five minute trailer than anything of real substance.<br /><br />Finally, there is an original theatrical trailer.ure some nice moments between characters (like one between Pacino and Penn). <br /> <br />Included from the previously released \\"Collector's Edition\\" is \\"The Making of Carlito's Way,\\" a 34 minute retrospective featurette.

B000AL730O|5.0|This is the album I think all of us have been waiting for from McCartney. It is totally unlike anything else from his post Beatle's career. It is psychedelic, haunting, pretty, dreamlike, slightly new ageish and somewhat dark as well as being a beautifully crafted work. Brian Wilson influences abound. It is \\"Pet Sounds\\" meets \\"Sgt. Pepper\\". There are hooks but not huge top 40 hooks, just countless little ones that grab you. This album is not for the casual listener. This is not backround music or the kind of CD you listen to in the car. This is a serious piece of music that demands your undivided listening attention. There are love songs (no \\"silly\\" one's although), songs of sadness, joy, fear, drinking tea and other subjects that are put in a blender mixed with English psychedelia. The lyrics are some of the most interesting I've heard from Paul in a long time. On top of all this we are treated to some of the highest, sweetest vocals he has ever produced. Paul also plays virtually every instrument in an amazing show of musicianship, bringing back memories of the McCartney I and McCartney II albums. I believe this will be known as his solo masterpiece, easily stacking up to most of his best Beatle's work too.
B000641Z90|4.0|Great show, says it'll be his last.  You don't have to be a Genesis/Phil Collins fan to enjoy this double CD.  The drum solo is something else with 3 of them ultimately playing together.  Worth every cent!
B00006IUL2|4.0|Previous reviewers have given much thought and details about the film that surpass what I could possibly say; instead, I wish only to share my reaction to this film.<br /><br />It does not bother me that the dialogue is minimal. Anyone who really wants to know can read the original play, or listen to Callas' recordings of the operatic rendition by Cherubini.  What does bother me is why Callas was dubbed.  She knew Italian, and surely could have delivered the lines in a capable manner.  What was Pasolini's intent?<br /><br />The landscapes that we see in this film are often breathtaking.  The land is harsh, often barren, but with a starkness and magnificence that beguile you.<br /><br />I was also struck by how the characters moved, particularly the servantwomen, with their sudden running motions.  It certainly distances you from modern-day life, to see people act in this manner.<br /><br />For the DVD release, they should have interviewed a film scholar, to shed light on Pasolini's technique and artistic choices.  Instead, we are just left with the film itself, without having our questions answered.<br /><br />It is so jarring to see La Divina in this film.  She has been mostly experienced through her recordings; in this, we SEE her, frame by frame.  Her beauty is not confined to the numerous, sleek photographs taken during her singing career.  She is a paragon of meditteranean beauty.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Stephen Chow has done a remarkable job in putting together a film that is stripped down to the essentials necessary to tell a remarkable story with a touch of both comedy and dramatic flair. The coreographed combat scenes are simply gorgoeus while not seeming at all out of place. I have watched this film twice now, and intend to watch it several times more. It tells a story that has been done to death - the \\"chosen one\\" style of kung-fu movie, but does it with such flair and panache that it's easy to fall in love with it. Rather than dwell on the mystical or get lost in the glory of computer graphics, Kung Fu Hustle manages to use all of these elements to advance a very simple and elegant story of redemption.<br /><br />If you get this film, thinking that your kids liked Shaolin Soccer and you want to give them something fun to watch, you should screen it first just to be sure that it's appropriate for them, as the feel of this movie is completely different than the neutered \\"American\\" cut of Shaolin Soccer. (It's much closer to the original Chinese version, including the same incidental violence and crude humor.)
0140067477|5.0|A great introductory book about Taoism presented in an accessible and fun way.<br /><br />More enjoyable than a textbook and can be read in an afternoon.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Well then, you may have noticed that eminem is white and more importantly why should it matter, eminem is a dope lyricist that is given hot beats from dr dre and himself, if the album sounds good and has alot of thought put into the lyrics it shouldn't matter what colour his skin is. This is a really good album with good guest apearances from d12, snoop dogg, xzibit, dr dre, rbx and sticky fingaz and i highly reccommend this album
0670033375|5.0|Collapse - 4-1/2 stars.  Excellent but not as fine as \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\"<br /><br />I find the 1-star reviews of this book very interesting.  They basically just say, Diamond is full of s**t, Diamond is a light-weight, Diamond is racist, Diamond is politically correct, Diamond piles it higher and deeper, Diamond knows nothing about what he is writing about.  I'd take their reviews more seriously if they could actually argue with Diamond's proposition.  If they could provide an alternate conclusion.  I can just see it:  \\"Carelessly consuming your resources and destroying your environment will lead to a long-lived, stable, and prosperous society.\\"  Yeah, that's it!<br /><br />Please have a look at the data:<br /><br />1.  World population change. Please see these data (ah, yes, Amazon won't let me include a link.  Please go to Google and search on \\"world population statistics\\"  click on the second link which is the US Census Bureau, World Population 1950 to 2050; but it actually goes way back.) It has multiple estimates of world population though time.  Put these data into your spreadsheet.  Plot the data.  Look carefully at the curve - it's the plot of an explosion.  I guarantee you that something will cut off that curve.  I don't know exactly how or when; but it will happen.  (war?, pandemic?, famine?, a combination?  It won't be pretty.)<br /><br />2.  Change in petroleum reserves<br /><br />3.  Change in fossil fuels consumption<br /><br />4.  Change in arable land area<br /><br />5.  Change in forest area (globally, not just in the northeastern US)<br /><br />6.  Change in ocean temperatures<br /><br />7.  Change in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere<br /><br />Project these trends forward.  Does this look sustainable to you?<br /><br />The critics of Diamond would like you to believe that we can continue business as usual, consuming energy, exterminating species, eroding arable land, clearing forests, growing our population, forever.  Does this make any sense to you?  There are good reasons for this:  greed and laziness.  They make a lot of money off the current system and change hurts.  Just keep driving that lumbering SUV.  Keep watching TV and playing video games.  Go shopping!  It'll all be just fine, forever, no effort is needed from us ...  Tax breaks to the wealthy and eliminating the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act will fix all these trends.<br /><br />If you want your kids and grandkids to have decent lives, I recommend change. I do not recommend whistling past the graveyard. You can think, \\"but it won't happen during my lifetime.\\" Maybe. It's the same attitude that approves of deficit spending for tax breaks for the extremely wealthy.  A little short-sighted, maybe?<br /><br />We have had a 100-year vacation from reality by burning petroleum. The petroleum isn't going to last beyond a couple more generations. And converting all that bound-up carbon into gaseous CO2 is going to have dramatic and unpredictable results.<br /><br />Great book, great argument, great author. Read it!  It's not perfect, of course.  It's not perfectly predictive.  But Diamond presents a strong case and the data are on his side.  You don't need ancient data, just look at current trends.money off the current system and change hurts.  Just keep driving that lumbering SUV.  Keep watching TV and playing video games.

B00005JNTX|3.0|This movie is wack. It has cool aspects and good actors, but alas it is still wack. 3 different characters, 3 different stories,all wack. Do you remember the first time you saw \\" Kill Bill\\" the first of course.{Forget about that sequel} The thought in your head that said \\"This is wacky but cool\\" ? Well the wac is intact but the cool .... well it lacks. This is based off a comic book, and it shows. I can asure you, the Sin City comic couldn't of been monthly issued to starving fans. It must've been that book at the bottom of tyhe shelf, with the nicely drawn pictures that caused you to flip through it. Possibly buy it, only to read ONCE.Alot of people gave it a low rating because they didn't understand what was going on. I understand the story COMPLETELY. {After going over it with a friend of mine who loves it} So I hope you understand and heed my warning when I say, at the end of the day its still wack. Don't miss understand, I didn't HATE this film. But I didn't like it enough to ever watch again. .....Ever.
015626224X|4.0|George Orwell is a man who believes in living every word of his novels. What was created in 'Homage to Catalonia' and 'The Road to Wigan Pier' is recreated here. His strong desire to both inform and reform society is insatiable and is in full flow.<br /><br />'Down and Out in Paris and London' is the account of his year spent among the poor of those two cities. He bounces from extremely low paying jobs in hellish hotel kitchens, to grimy doss houses where he is surrounded by his fellow tramp. His attitude to the poor, and more specifically the homeless is different from those who share his upper class English upbringing, and his Etonian education. He recognises them as human beings and not just rogues who would mug you given half a chance. He shows them as people who feel pain, who long for things they cannot have and who are capable of love. He does all of this without a whiff of condescension or irreverance.<br /><br />However Orwell has no interest in over-romanticising their story either. Although he acknowledges that there are hard luck stories behind the destitution of most, if not all of them, he sheds light on their scoundrel nature as well. They by and large have good hearts but they also have to eat and are not above bending or even breaking the law.<br /><br />'Down and Out in Paris and London' is a well written, intelligent and witty book that gives a fantastic and shocking insight into the lives of a social group who are seldom, if ever, featured by the mass media.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This a classic album, although its rather short it makes up for it in quality by not having one bad sounding song on it, which i think is account of dr dre just as much as it is snoop dogg. Some of the stand out songs for me are<br /><br />-tha shiznit<br /><br />-gin and juice<br /><br />-whats my name<br /><br />-pump pump<br /><br /> I highly reccomend this album
0783231032|4.0|Paranoia most certainly does meet pandemonium. It's hard to believe that this was an early Steven Speilberg production, but with a stellar cast of lunatics and wannabee lunatics, it certainly hits it's mark. If you enjoyed \\"The Blues Brothers\\" then you'll have a ball with this movie. <br /> <br />John Belushi is at his maniacal best as Captain \\"Wild Bill\\" Kelso and receives spirited support from Ned Beatty, Dan Aykroyd, Warren Oates and Slim Pickens. <br /> <br />The standout scenes are the dance-off contest at the USO show, the capture of Hollis T Wood by the Japanese, and the ferris wheel observation post. <br /> <br />A cult movie that did not receive the acclaim of the previously mentioned \\"Blues Brothers\\" or \\"Animal House\\" but a better production overall thanks to Spielberg's talents.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|Well, who is she?????   Well, during the listen, I guessed Billie Holliday but then Doris Day kept piping in.  i could not tell which singer it was,  and low and behold it was a combo of the two in the persona of Mis Madeleine.   Dont buy this for any thing but easy listening.  It is the perfect background dinner music or for a middle age seduction,  If you put it in the car for listening on a drive you will fall asleep,  Her perfect Ella Fitzgerald voice is slow and easy.  It is a wonderful listen, great for a rainy lazy afternoon in the hammock.

B000AL730O|5.0|This is not your typical McCartney album, and it took a few listenings to appreciate it. But this may be the most complete, fully realized and emotionally complex work Paul McCartney has done since \\"Tug of War,\\" some 23 years ago. There is not a seriously weak track on here (unlike even some fine efforts like \\"Flaming Pie,\\" which had a couple clunkers), and the album's best moments are just glorious. \\"Too Much Rain,\\" in particular, gives me chills every time I listen to it. Paul's innate optimism remains intact, but you can tell that this is a man who's experienced some pain -- pain that he's channeled into some exquisitly beautiful music. Bravo.
B00005MP58|5.0|After watching this miniseries for years on VHS tapes (taped off the TV, mind you), I was so excited to get the DVD. No commercials, and clear sound and picture. What a thrill! AND, there were parts of the movie that were cut from the version on I saw on A&E. I sat enraptured as I watched the DVD, never sure when a new scene would pop up. It was like watching it for the very first time. I do agree that there should have been more extras included, but that didn't seem to matter as I was watching the movie. The new P&P release this Christmas, with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth, has mighty big shoes to fill.
B000007VCO|5.0|I had not heard this album since buying it [on vinyl] from a junk shop for 50pence [yes true!!] some ooh..20 years ago...my oh my....understandable sentiment aside, on it went and boy oh boy..there it was again..beautifulness, calm, peace, virtuosity..just how I had remembered it...so it wasn't just a silver dream? No, it was golden reality all over again...fabulous.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Listening to the CD as I write.   <br /> <br />My wife and I were watching the local PBS Channel on which the Celtic Woman performance was aired.  Catching it in the middle of the performance, I immediately turned to our local programming guide to find when it would be aired again.  We have watched the performance twice since! <br /> <br />God has blessed these five young women with talents that reach in and take hold of your inner soul!!!  Not to slight the talents blessed upon David Downes in orchestration of such a production!!!  My praise goes out to all those involved in this creation!!! <br /> <br />As a member of an Accapela singing group, I stand in awe of the purity of the voice and interpetation of each work!
0441003257|5.0|This book is so funny, I am thinking of buying it's brother, the nice and accurate profecies.

B00005JNTX|5.0|Rodriguez and Tarantino cotinue their productive collaboration. It takes a few minutes to become engrossed but the wait is well worth it.  Bruce Willis is a mjor flop, a shadow of his role in Pulp Fiction.  On the other hand, Micky Rourke is great--the role of a lifetime for him.  Fantastic aesthetic.  A must view.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|I used to have to find Pearl Jam bits & pieces here and there and the sound quality was bad and I never knew if I had them all.  This CD contains a lot of extra stuff not on any other album hence the title \\"Lost Dogs\\".  A must buy for any PJ fan.
0060012358|5.0|i really enjoyed this book. i read often and i am so happy when i find a book, or if I am really lucky a writer with many books, who writes a creative, interesting, enjoyable, innovative read. that is why finding terry pratchett has made me so happy. he is a fantastic writer. i would recommend this book to any of my friends. it is funny and creative. it is a very enjoyable read. i would recommend any book by terry pratchett
B00006CXSS|5.0|Well past five stars and in some rarefied air--that is how really good this is.  The music, the acting, the cinematography, and virtually everything else is a marvelous portrayal of the grit and courage of some of America's finest to ever go into battle.  This is really a \\"must see\\" for any citizen of this country...a story, film, and documentary that should rightfully be on anyone's list of things to do before they die.

B00009V7P8|5.0|I love this album. Each song has a wonderful melody that really sticks in your heart and head. Of course, the song from Closer is particularly haunting. Highly, highly recommended for people who are fed up of the commercial c@%p that's flooding the airways these days.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|This is a marvelous, hold onto your chair and entertaining movie that takes you into an adventure so far away from every day reality that I highly recommend everyone to own this DVD for your movie night collection. The characters work so well together it is as thought they were in a series of adventure movies from the past.  It is also so refreshing not to hear foul language every 10 minutes in a film.  Kido's to the producer, creative writer, and the actors who bring this story to life and for pulling off something so compelling that my family will treasure for years to come.
0517220784|4.0|The first Sherlock Holmes book I ever read was given to me as a gift for my thirteenth birthday. It was a collection of the short stories, with a wonderful leather trim and gold leafing, and I thought it was fantastic. I read the first story, and was instantly hooked. Within a few days, I was disappointed with my wonderful new book because it was incomplete. I had devoured all of the selected stories, and was ready for more.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, I purchased what purported to be the 'only complete Sherlock Holmes available', compiled by Christopher Morley. This became my favourite book.  However, I have continued to collect editions of the Sherlock Holmes stories, and this is one of those collections.  It does contain all the short stories and all the novels.  It does not have illustrations or other commentary, and the print (in a double-column format) is rather small, but it is nonetheless a useful text for those who don't want to have a heavier book in their hands.<br /><br />The original stories, which appeared in The Strand magazine, were illustrated, by the great illustrator Sidney Paget.<br /><br />From the beginning introduction of Holmes and Watson to Holmes' gentle retirement to beekeepping on the southern coast of England, this book contains all the essential stories (none of the apocryphal, anecdotal, or tribute-written pieces are contained here). Holmes was often thought to be a real person, and Sherlockians the world over still search for 'evidence' to prove that he was. During his 'lifetime', the post office for the Baker Street area regularly received mail addressed to Holmes or Watson at 221B Baker Street. While such an address does not (and did not during the late Victorian era) exist, there is a business on the site that would be 221B, and they have dedicated a desk to Holmes, and strive to answer mail received in the great detective's name.<br /><br />Perhaps the two elements that made Holmes and Watson the world-renowned figures that they became are, first, the dominance of the British Empire globally at the time Conan Doyle was writing, which made English things sought-after, admired, and to be emulated, and secondly, the introduction of a method of detection hitherto unknown, both in the annals of detective stories (save perhaps in a proto-form in Poe and a few other obscure pieces of dubious literary merit) and in real life.<br /><br />Holmesian tales became required reading in the training of police and detectives in many parts of the world. It is still recommended even when it is not required.<br /><br />Holmes permeates other literature and venues as well. When Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation looks for images of Holmes, he is being guided by the descriptions in the stories as well as by the illustrations in The Strand. When the BBC produced Jeremy Brett's rendering of Holmes, the same holds true. When Basil Rathbone's films were cast, these illustrations and stories were uppermost in the directors' minds.<br /><br />So, pull some tobacco from your persian slipper, stoke your pipe, scratch out a tune on your violin, and re-enter the gas-lit world of the foggy London, where danger is afoot and one detective can always save the day.es that they became are, first, the dominance of the British Empire globally at the time Conan Doyle was writing, which made English things sought-after, admired, and to be emulated, and secondly, the introduction of a method of detection hitherto unknown, both in the annals of detective stories (save perhaps in a proto-form in Poe and a few other obscure pieces of dubious literary merit) and in real life.  <br /> <br />Holmesian tales became required reading in the training of police and detectives in many parts of the world.

0553579908|5.0|What can I say, other than George R.R. Martin continues his massive, intricate epic in this second volume, and the cliffhangers at the end are even better than the ones in the first book.  Completely first-rate, and I am now diving into volume three.  Truly the thinking person's fantasy series.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is one of the best animated films in history. I have seen this dozens of time (Partially) thanks to my daughter. She LOVES it. Yes there are scary moments. If you have a sensitive kid then beware. SPOILER AHEAD: The mother and all her children die (except Nemo) in the beginning so be prepared with your kids. <br /> <br />Follow Marlin the clown fish searching for is lost son with plenty of adventures to keep you entertained.  <br />Amazing and beautiful animation, great voices, especially Ellen DeGeneres. Great for adults and children. Pixar continues to raise the bar.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended!!!!
B00008S2VG|3.0|Even though this is not Madonna's best album, I guess there are some great songs on it. Personally, I think one of her Top 5 ever Greatest Songs is on it, Nothing Fails, along with great tunes like X-tatic Process, Easy Ride, Nobody knows me and Hollywood... But the anti-war message burned up so many american minds who still think George W. Bush is a decent human being.. Fortunaly today, there are not so many of them out there...  Back in 2003 when this album was released it was still a big deal... But Now in 2005, is not only Madonna speaking away this kind of message, there is also Green Day (great band) and Kanye West, etc etc etc... <br />Long LIVE THE QUEEN OF POP, MADONNAAAAA!!!!!
B00028HBKM|5.0|(gave this 5 stars because there is not an option to NOT RATE IT!) <br /> <br />I don't want to give this film any stars because I don't think this is simply \\"entertainment\\" for \\"entertainment's sake\\".  It's part art and message, and as one going in an art gallery, one must interpret the piece according to what he or she knows and feels.   <br /> <br />Viewers not very well-versed or even halfway-versed in the relevant Biblical scriptures will not understand that this is not based on some made up Hollywood storyline with a Hollywood plot.  Viewers having some knowledge or indepth knowledge of the scriptures will see this as Gibson's close rendering of the scriptures which have existed before and will exist beyond our own time. <br /> <br />Personally, while I found the brutality harsh and realistic, I came away from the movie with a sense of of humility and the need to show my fellow human brother and sisters(even my enemies) love.  I would caution parents and other sensitive individuals (because children are not the only ones who can't handle such realistic brutality in a mature way, the message itself should not be cloaked though) to think about whether the individual in question would be able to handle this. <br /> <br />From an artistic standpoint, the filmography is moving and rich, and the actors played their parts well and in keeping with the personalities and character of the historical individuals. <br /> <br />Some people will see this movie just to say they've seen it, some will see it with the pre-existing ulterior motive of making light of it and the message, some will see it with an open-mind and heart, and some will see it because of their personal relationship with Christ.  I wonder why you will choose to see it or purchase it?
B000002BE9|5.0|... I say yet, because \\"Extraordinary Machine\\" is not (legally) out yet. As much praise as her second album (\\"When The Pawn...\\") gets, I truly believe that this is better, and also outclasses many of my other favorites. <br />\\"Sleep To Dream\\": This has the most delightfully snarling lyrics I've ever heard (\\"don't make it a big deal/ don't be so sensitive!/ we're not playing a game anymore/ you don't have to be so defensive.\\") <br />\\"Sullen Girl\\": Kind of a throwaway, but I still find it gets stuck in my head an awful lot. <br />\\"Shadowboxer\\": Great piano, perfect lyrics. You don't think it can get any better until it ends and you hear... <br />\\"Criminal\\": ...Fiona strike back with sinuous instrumentals, slinky piano and witty, bad-girl words. <br />\\"Slow Like Honey\\": My favorite. You have to hear it to believe it. If you have even a shred of love for jazz, this will KNOCK YOUR FEET OFF, not just your socks. <br />\\"The First Taste\\": Eh. It doesn't really go anywhere. <br />\\"Never Is A Promise\\": Both strong and tearfully fragile at the same time. <br />\\"The Child Is Gone\\": A close runner up to \\"Slow Like Honey\\" and \\"Criminal.\\" Here, she is bitter, brooding, diminished, yet still resilient. This song will haunt you. <br />\\"Pale September\\": Pleasant, light. <br />\\"Carrion\\": Depends on your mood. <br /> <br />All CDs have their weak tracks, but this one has more good tracks than most, including its successor, plus its highlights tend to be better. Don't skip this CD just because you've heard \\"When The Pawn...\\" is the \\"good one.\\" You will be missing out on some of her greatest work.
B00008K7AM|5.0|It doesn't matter how many of these \\"Body-change\\" movies you have seen - You can always be amazed at the 'uncovered' areas the new ones seem to find..<br /><br />The Hot Chick has an awesome cast that have amazing talent within this genre..  Rob Schneider - an expert at putting himself in the most uncomfortable positions (Animal, Deuce Bigalow; Male Gigolo) - Anna Feris the queen of satire herself(Scary Movie 1, 2 & 3) - and lastly Rachel McAdams who puts herself into a different role everytime you see her (The Notebook, Wedding Crashers, Red Eye)..<br /><br />Take a beautiful - rich & popular girl & switch her with a lowlife 30 year old dead beat - and what do you get? \\".. this has to be the worst day of my life\\"..<br /><br />Want to laugh - want to experience the opposite sex to the very extreme - Then The Hot Chick is for you..<br /><br />5 Stars!
B00002MZ4W|3.0|Everyone says that this album is so good, but it seems to me that they are concentrating on a few good songs.  <br />\\"On The Bound\\": This is one of the good songs. Fiona purrs, drawls, and half-shouts over a demented carnival-esque tune about her obsession (\\"you're all I need... and maybe some faith would do me good.\\") <br />\\"To Your Love\\": This is one of the vitriolic songs I don't like. Her voice, normally beautiful and capable of many things, becomes croaky at points. <br />\\"Limp\\": A cut above \\"To Your Love,\\" in the same general angry category. <br />\\"Love Ridden\\": A reasonably good ballad. <br />\\"Paper Bag\\": This adorable, well-done little song is my favorite. I often find myself singing it in public at random times, and no one minds because it is so likeable. <br />\\"A Mistake\\": Another croaky song. <br />\\"Fast As You Can\\": Get away from this song as fast as you can. The lyrics are lame; the instrumentals are worse. <br />\\"The Way Things Are\\": A mediocre song in which Fiona accepts a lousy relationship, which is a surprising change. <br />\\"Get Gone\\": Once again... similar to the preceding track, but a cut above (because she decides she isn't willing to suffer after all). <br />\\"I Know\\": A sad, affecting ballad about being willing to sacrifice.  <br />The three good songs are worth the money, in fact they elevated my rating quite a bit, but if you want a consistently good Fiona Apple album, go for Tidal.

B00005JLEJ|4.0|If you love Kurosawa's movies because of great characters and story line, this movie may disappoint you.  There are lots of characters but the story is difficult to follow.  Shintaro Katsu (the classic Zatoichi actor) was originally cast in the main role but due to arguements with Kurosawa he was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai.  This is good because while Katsu was fabulous as Zatoichi, you just can't picture him playing a feudal lord.  Nakadai is convincing.  As we was later in Ran.  The costumes are gorgeous and the scenery wonderful, but the story is not as crisp as Seven Samurai or as compelling as Ikiru.  But I still enjoyed the movie for all the other Kurosawa features, high winds, heavy rain, panoramic shots, great close-ups and costumes.  Nakadai is also wonderful in Sword of Doom, Yojimbo, Ran and Kill!.  Hara Kiri was too gruesome though his acting was good.  Also, the Criterion Collection versions are wonderfully done in DVD format.  I always look for their version if available.  Now can we get Drunken Angel on DVD please?
B000AADYYO|5.0|Yet other improvement. This album is a another major step forward for Opeth because they added a keyboardist to the band and incorporated him very well. It's a step forward because they managed to create another CD without reproducing any song or soundlike anything from any previous album, and in such a way that they creted another masterpiece (in typical Opeth fashion), some say along the line of Blackwater Park. I think it's more comarable to Still Life or My Arms Your Hearse. The Baying of the Hounds and Atonement or remarkable, but every song is its own well-orchestrated piece. It (like very other album of theirs) is for rock fans and every one else. Listen to one song and you'll agree.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Great item.  I just wish more Amazon sellers shipped quickly,
B00003CX95|5.0|If you are a Mel Gibson fan of any sorts this movie is a must see. A wonderful directing job, supported by a wonderful cast. Men will appericate the attitude depicted by Mel Gibson towards his love and his country along with the added violence. Women will swoon and pine for the hopeless romantic they will find in Mel as he avenges the death of his wife and fights for the freedom of his fellow countrymen. I have respect for Mel as a director.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|Hey I love this stuff.  I'm a 60 year old working guitar player who in the '50's and 60's used search for video performances of ANY type of guitar player.  From James Burton on \\"The Adventures or Ozzie and Harriet\\" to Buddy Merrill on \\"The Lawrence Welk Show\\" and of course all Ed Sullivan Show performances from Segovia to Buddy Holly.  I even watched the unbearable \\"Merv Griffin Show\\" to check out Herb Ellis.<br /><br />  Fast forward to today, I'm loving the availablity of live guitar performances, and I'm metzmerized by great playing of any type. For my taste, I loved John McLaughlin's performance, plugged into a laptop, and just killing it and I wanted more  I would have liked more too of Larry Carlton, especially playing some improvised blues/jazz. I wished they would have invited ROBBEN FORD to the party.  Eric smokes on several tunes including of all things, \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" which I usually hate.  Doyle Bramhall II's unique take on blues is outstanding, and I enjoyed the hilariously dopey Joe Walsh backing James Taylor, who is always a class act.<br /><br />Buddy Guy, B.B., were great as was Jimmy Vaughn.  Of course the star was Eric and he shone though the heat (100 degrees +) was killer.  If you love this stuff, check out Robben Ford's live performance DVD's.
B0002ZMJ5M|4.0|Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow brings to mind Spinal Tap's mini-stonehenge.  If they'd left that turkey off, I'd have given it five stars.  But \\"Solstice Bells\\" makes up for it.  Crank it up!
B000A3DFZE|3.0|THIS CD DOES NOT HARKEN BACK TO THE DAYS OF SLOWHAND OR DEREK AND THE DOMINOES.   <br /> <br />I was so mad when I first played this.  I have read many reviews (including \\"profession\\" reviews) that this CD goes back to the days of Slowhand, Delaney and Bonnie and Derek and the Dominoes.  But, that is not true.  It is just a continuation of, but a major improvement over Reptile.   <br /> <br />I did not like this CD when I first played it, because I was expecting something like Slowhand or Behind the Sun.  But, after I got over that bias, and listened to it again, I found that there are some good songs on the CD. <br /> <br />It starts out with a fun \\"So Tired\\", which is about not getting enough sleep when you have a newborn. When I first started listening to Clapton, I never thought that I would relate to a song about having children.  Well, we all grow eventually. <br /> <br />Love Don't Love Nobody is a good, long, soulful tune.  I never thought I would enjoy a soul tune by Clapton, since usually when he does soul, it is overproduced.    There are a couple of good rocking blues numbers,like One Day and Lost and Found. <br /> <br />However, about half of the CD is not very successful.  Some of the cover tunes are not very good.  His version of Stevie Wonders' \\"Im Going Left\\" makes the lyrics just sound silly.  He does an uninspired version of George Harrison's \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\". <br /> <br />\\"Revolution\\" is another attempt of Clapton to do mild reggae.  Eric Clapton is to reggae as Pat Boone was to rock and roll.  Pat Boone scored big with Chuck Berry classics, giving them a white voice so they could be sold to the masses. <br /> <br />This CD certainly has more life and emotion than Reptile or the live CD One Car.  About half of it is worth keeping.
B000002I6V|4.0|I bought this LP at the same time I bought Wild tales in 1973. It had been out for a couple of years. My girlfriend told me it was great. My 23-year old brother had died in a car accident 6 months earlier so I was \\"all tore up\\". This album and Songs for Beginners soothed my aching soul for many years. I don't know how these songs stand up in the historical perspective of CSN. Some of the songs do sound a little dated now. I know every song on these two albums by heart because I sang and played along for years and lived them. Friends were going to prison for 20 years for a joint in Texas and Graham was just singing and writing about what was going on around us. What a back up band he had back then. David Lindley was superb. I liked Graham so much I named my white German shepherd,\\"Nash\\" after him. He was my best friend for ten years. We named the cat, \\"Crosby\\". I never missed these guys in concert with and without Stills and Young. Wild Tales is a little more up-tempo than \\"Songs for Beginners.\\" It's all a matter of taste. If you like CSN then you'll like these first two solo projects by Nash.

B000660UN0|5.0|I love the blues. When the Hendrix, early Stones, Clapton with Mayall, and all this reconstituted blues came over from England I loved it. I wasn't into the old original creators back then; I was only 11 years old. Now that I met Albert King and shook his giant hands. I've seen and heard Muddy Waters, Albert Collins, Buddy Guy, and Stevie Ray all the time live in the late seventies & early eighties when I lived in Austin. I've seen SRV rise and fall and rise again. I have a completely different frame of mind about it. The Blues lives and breathes. You have to live a hard life to really sing these blues with conviction. Eric does it right on this CD/DVD combo. Eric has finally reached the age and gone through addiction hell long enough that he can sing these Robert Johnson classics from deep down in his soul. It's nice to hear this music without all the hiss, clicks, and pops of the originals from Robert J. Though I'll always love the originals a touch more this is a NICE collection. He has the best Rhythm section in Steve Gadd, Nathan East, Doyle Bramhall the second. Don't forget Doyle's daddy was a drummer and co-wrote some of Stevie's best tunes. I live in a suburb of Dallas, after blessing us with the Crossroads Festival, Eric goes and does these great tributes to Robert J. in \\"Me & Mr. Johnson and Sessions\\". If you love the Blues. Listen to the Bluesman. He calls you late at night when you've lost your lover, you're tired and hungry and hurtin. Put on The Blues and before long, you'll start feeling a whole lot better. That's what B.B. King told me one night and I believe him.
0385513755|5.0|It is the best book...  I am normally not a big reader, but I do have to say that Dan Brown really knows how to keep people interested.  He has a way of writting that it is so easy to paint a mental picture of what you are reading, that it is easy to think that you are in the middle of the action.  I read this book and I had to get the prequel.  ( Angels and Demons ).  It is just as good, if not better.  I am almost done with it and I already oredered two of his other books, Digital Fortress and Deception Point
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I know what you all are thinking, how can it be the best cd ever? Well it is. The sound has evolved drastically since the first cd and all for the better. The new emotion that vocalist Jared Leto has put in the songs is almost heartbreaking to listen to. If you don't believe me listen to #3 The Kill, when he says \\"Look in my eyes, You're killing me, killing me.\\" Don't tell me that you can't feel what he is trying to get across. Incredible drums come through once again through his brother Shannon and the two other members Tomo and Matt contribute just as much to the overall sound of the music. If you have never heard the band before but aren't sure if you want to buy the cd go over to the website. There you can listen to 3 of the songs and even watch the new video for the opening track Attack.

B0009VRHLK|5.0|I'll Keep this short. - For all you idiotic geek reviewers who are watching this movie just for the Chloe oral scene, please go back to watching Revenge of the Nerds. <br /> <br />The majority of people who hate this movie, hate it because of the director. For some reason people despise Vincent Gallo, now it may possibly be due to jealousy or just plain stupidity(most likely both).  <br /> <br />Bootom Line - Do not watch this movie if you've never seen any movie outside of the usual mainstream filth.  <br />Unless you have an open mind you are not gonna enjoy this masterpiece!
B000AOENJA|4.0|I'm an artist who needs background music to set the mood for my day and this is my latest discovery. The clear acoustic quality is simply a joy on some tracks and a lush orchestration is perfect for others.<br /><br />Do I really like David Gray's music? Well I'm new to it but I can say that I'm even blogging about music on my Art blog. That's entirely because of offerings like this.<br /><br />\\"Alibi\\" and \\"The One I Love\\" kick the CD off with lyrical qualities and the rest of the music falls in line in a most lovely way. I heard an Allison Krause like vocal in \\"From Here You Can Almost See The Sea,\\" and the unmistakable influence of Bob Dylan in \\"Ain't No Love.\\" And it's amazing how \\"Dissapearing World\\" is positively Lennon-esque<br /><br />But after all that, who could have predicted that I would ever utter the following words: One of my favorites just has to be \\"Hospital Food.\\"<br /><br />It's got something special and I look forward to exploring more of this artists work.<br /><br />Visit me at [...]<br /><br />and [...]
B00005JNTX|3.0|This was an interesting movie, and the plots were ok, but it wasn't the greatest movie i've ever seen.  I thought the plots got kind of repetitive and monotonous after the first couple of stories.  Not to mention it was really depressing.  So, overall, nice try, but I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone who isn't a die-hard Tarantino fan.
B00080ZG1A|5.0|Was a very well done movie.Had many facts of Mr Hughes life as he lived it.Mr Hughes was way ahead of his times.From a very young age Mr Hughes knew what he wanted out of life and went after it.I enjoyed this movie.

B00095MLGC|5.0|I was thrilled to finally be able to obtain the double CD set of Up the Downstair as it was not available on my previous attempts to buy it.  It is excellent and definite \\"ear candy\\" for those who enjoy the earlier music of this awesome band. The 2nd CD is all instrumental and most enjoyable. I would highly recommend it to all serious Porcupine Tree fans.  It will not disappoint you.
1577314808|5.0|This book is not for everyone...it is for those with open hearts and who really LISTEN beyond the words..don't read with the mind...listen with the being!  He is a great spiritual teacher..  One of the very best.      I have read many spiritual books and feel that I'm half way there...I totally understood the book from beginning to end.  It's very simple and clear...so effective..it is my bible.      But don't get confused...Eckart Tolle is telling you all the things you already know, but your mind refuses to accept!  Remember, you are NOT your mind, you never were.  I'd like to recommend a wonderful bit of writing from Ken Wilber entitled 'From here to infinity in 3 pages...'       Well done to a brilliant writer.  He is not talking from the ego, but from his being and it's real, when you let it be.      Don't try to understand it, LIVE IT!
B000AL730O|1.0|All the hype, and all the expectant results are missing from this very simple, boring offering by Sir Paul.  In a few of the songs I really thought this legendary artist was going to start singing the Barney song... ' I love you, you love me etcc...'  Want some quality offerings by an ex-Beatle?  Check out Ringo Stars most recent release.  This offering by Paul again makes us long for and truly miss John Lennon.  Dont even think of listening to some of Paul's solo work prior to this, ie:  Band on the Run, Venus and Mars, etc.. as you will become even more disenchanted with this poor offering.

My sister bought the Beatles, and even though I loved them too....well the Stones were...\\"Rockin\\"...That LP is still in my collection but a nice crisp CD copy is what I spin these days....Hard to believe 40 years of this terrific album. Still a keeper.
0743454537|5.0|I just finished reading my Sister's Keeper and I have to say that this book has been by far the book that has restored my love for the written word. I have read plenty of books and lately, it seems I have made poor choices but as I saw this book and read the back cover, I decided to give it a whirl and I was not disappointed. I could not put it down and finished it relatively quickly. <br /> <br />I found myself laughing, crying and screaming at the injustices that this book portrayed. This book is about redemption. This book is about the difficult choices that parent's make, including mistakes that could not be avoided or that is what they try to convince themselves is the truth. It deals with having siblings and sibling rivalry. It deals with loving (or seemingly loving) one child over the others. It deals with growing up. It deals with guilt. It deals with suffering. It deals with compassion. It deals with sisterly love. It deals with a rebel child. It deals, in one word, with life and a reminder that you are not the only one controlling it.  <br /> <br />The ending of the book was bittersweet to me. As I was reading the chapters, I found myself siding with Anna but then after another chapter I found myself having compassion for Sara. Being a donor is never an easy thing but Jodi Picoult weaves it so beautifully that even though the ending is not what I wanted to see, it is fitting. It is reality. It is simply something that might happen and something that Picoult had the courage to write about.  <br /> <br />I for one, admire her novel and applaud her courage. As I read some of the reviews, many people were not happy with the ending but I for one, after having a good cry, understood that in life not everyone has a happy ending. <br /> <br />Please read this book. You all deserve to have the experience of reading it.  <br /> <br />Truly inspiring. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002MPU1K|2.0|We saw Peter Cincotti twice in NYC, and was blown away both times.  Bought his first CD and recommended it several times, anxiously awaiting this one. <br />We couldn't be more disappointed.  Cincotti's piano playing is true virtuosity, but his singing just isn't up to where it needs to go.  Bali H'ai is one of the most unfortunate choices I have ever heard on an album - almost unlistenable.  The rest aren't much better. I'd like to put the onus on his handlers for letting him make this one - I just hope it doesn't sink him, because I still believe he has a great future.
B00012QM9K|5.0|This special edition is excellent !!! ... The box, the book, the film, the DVD, the CD Soundtrack, the senitype, everything is excellent.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|One of the best Metal albums of 2005, more melodic in some parts, but still bada**, I know some people frowned when they released albums like \\"Outcast\\" and \\"Endorama\\" frown no more, this CD is excellent, Mille's vocals aren't as raspy as on the old albums, but he still sounds pissed off, and that's the way to be, the riffs are killer, everything about the album is killer, if you're tired of these nu-metal bands, and want something new to listen to, look no further, you've found it, I was skeptical of this release at first, but when I finally heard it, I finally realized, I had nothing to worry about, some really fast songs, some nice mid-paced ones, it has everything Metal should have, buy it, other great releases of 2005 Niles \\"Annihilation of the Wicked\\" HEY!, what is this? GOOD BRUTAL DEATH METAL?!, YES, IT IS!, and Obituarys \\"Frozen in Time\\" THEY ARE BACK!
0060254920|5.0|This book is an all around wonderful book. I read it when I was little and plan on reading it to my kids someday. Max shows you just how a childs imagination adventures even when they have been sent to their room.  <br />The books author, Maurice Sendak, co-authored his very first published book when he was only 19 years of age. When he was a child he was very sick and his mom use to be very concerned for his health and safety. So in most of his books you will notice a moon somewhere in the picture watching over the scene. He says that the moon is his mother peaking out the window at him when he was a child to be sure that he was alright. That just goes to show that even the little things in a book mean something. <br />
B000063COX|4.0|Iron Maiden helped invent metal in the late seventies. This album is a collection of recordings from the earliest days of Maiden with original front man Paul Dianno.<br /><br />This was their first official album. I find this album to be incredible and one of the definitions of HEAVY METAL. This is before the flamboyant wails of BRUCE DICKINSON, the focus is way more on the guitars. Paul Dianno is way more low key. His image was much different. This is what I like. Though, I like Bruce, this album and KILLERS is REAL METAL. BANGIN' DIRTY CHICKS WITHOUT A CONDOM METAL! YEAH! DRINKIN WHISKEY OUT HE BOTTLE AND WASHIN' IT DOWN WITH MORE WHISKEY METAL! YEAH!<br /><br />Just listen to PHANTOM OF THE OPERA you'll understand.<br /><br />RUNNIN FREE, CHARLOTTE THE HARLOTT, the eerie ballad STRANGE WORLD are honorable mentions. THIS ALBUM ROCKS AS DOES KILLERS!
0553278223|4.0|I've had this book laying around for years, kind of wish I would have read it sooner. The book spans around 27 years of man/martian history. It is striking in alegory and observation. Anyone with and eye and an ear should enjoy the many short stories that deal with issues like racism, greed, paranoia, hate, loss, and jealousy; just to name a few. The book is at times humorous, and sad, but always profound. I realy enjoyed watching the story progress through the wonder in frontier, into the darkness of self destruction, and into the silver lining of hope.  <br /> <br />I should also warn that the book is a compilation of short stories that follows a timeline, or chronicle of martian/man history, and not one straight novel with long developing plot and characters, though some do have multiple appearances. It is a book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and backgrounds. Don't miss it. I know it made me a fan of Ray Bradbury.
B000063DHL|5.0|The opening to this thing absolutley cooks and from there this album is a progressive masterpeice! I love pretty much every album up until seventh son but I will give this one honorable mention.<br /><br />While I think that Maiden become more of a prog band with BRUCE DICKINSON I still like his stuff.<br />MAIDEN ONE and KILLERS are the NO BULL metal albums, but if you want to escape into the music your better off with BRUCE ERA stuff. SOMWHERE IN TIME is a great album to get lost in, start to finish, theres so many layers to it and little surprises that jump out later on. (Listen on a good pair of phones and you'll know what I'm saying).<br />To the girl posted before me, LOTS OF PEOPLE LOVE THIS ONE! However lots of people hate it too, I never understand things like this.  Its got a different feel thaan the stuff before it, but it still wasn't cheesy eighties schlock. It was experimental metal, and if you ask me the results were excellent.<br /><br />SEVENTH SON is also great but was the beggining of the end for the MAIDEN GOLDEN AGE. Its a little more poppish but still very good. I RECOMMEND GETTING THEM BOTH TOGETHER if only just to compare and contrast.
0345446798|5.0|This is a great book and I would recommend this to any dog lover. It gives a great view and perspective of how a dog's mind thinks and how the behavior is in a pack.

B0000C8AW2|3.0|Bobby needs to release an album of the last three years on tour. 2002-2005 and 90% should be dedicated to mending the classics that he butchered between 1978 and 1988. Starting with this album STREET LEGAL.<br />He did TALES OF YANKEE POWER when I saw him last year and it was amazing. So much better than the poorly produced peice on this album.<br />We all know that (except for maybe the christian rock ones-which suck) Dylan was just going through the motions on these albums, letting the record company take complete control, because he didn't care enough. THE EIGHTIES seem to have been a rough time for all, and lets face it, the eighties started in 1978. Music wise anyway.<br />The other stuff that I would love to hear revamped would be SLOW TRAIN, much of INFIDELS, DARK EYES from EMPIRE BURLESQUE and a version of SILVIO from DOWN IN THE GROOVE. It would be cool to have a collection of this stuff with his current band at least to give some of these lost songs a better chance in the sun.
0452284392|5.0|This book was written for someone like me--the student exploring many of these concepts for the first time.  Barabasi spends a lot of time on the evolution of discoveries that has lead to the understanding of networks held by most today.  This historical account provides a foundation of understanding, essential for someone trying to grasp this information, but who never was never taught how the field began.<br /><br />Barabasi writes in a simple but colorful way.  He manages to make complex ideas easily understood and interesting by using real-life examples, metaphors, stories and humor.  Furthermore, his passion for this subject cannot help but come through.  While the title sounds like a textbook, the book reads much more like nonfiction.  His style of writing is effective in relaying the information as well as keeping the reader motivated to learn more.<br /><br />I appreciated his insights on how diverse networks, from sexual relations to the internet to businesses, have similar topologies and are therefore subject to similar rules.  And, his challenge to examine things not as individual phenomenon, but as phenomenon inescapably linked.
B000068OSK|5.0|I was listening to this outfit before I even knew who they were. I was looking for a live Dylan version of ONE MORE CUP OF COFFEE when I stumbled upon this version. Eventually I found out what I was listening to and started to download stuff from these guys.<br /><br />Finally when I decided to buy an album WHITE BLOOD CELLS had just came out and I bought that one.<br /><br />Why did that one break them into the public eye? The first two are WAY better than 3,4, or 5. Although these albums are all ok, they got nothing on these two.<br /><br />You talk about the way these two produce an album. This first album has a very garage like feel to it and the second does too only that one is a little more crisp.<br /><br />THESE ARE BOTH VERY NECESSARY no bull, just loud rough cuts. PUNKBLUES if you wanna call it that. Just listen to JIMMY THE EXPLODER and you'll get the point, then STOP BREAKING DOWN, instantly one of my favorite versions of this song. BIG THREE next and you realize that it ain't over till its over. Other worthy tracks are the cover of ST JAMES and SUGAR NEVER TASTED SO GOOD.<br /><br />You'll see. 3,4,and even the newest one lack the raw power of these first two. Jack White gets to sensitive after these.
B0008ISM40|5.0|PLEASE,.....You must listen to Right Where It belongs, it's the most beautiful song on this cd. If you need a song that makes you think about your life or any situation you're going through, then this is th song.
B000002KCI|5.0|This album ROCKS! CRAZY HORSE is an amazing band and NEIL YOUNG ditto.<br />Although some of these songs have lyrical content of bitter/deppressing nature, the guitar work livens it all right up. You should be used to NEIL YOUNGS chipper attitude by now anyway.<br />The album begins and ends on a soft note but the whole belly of it is GRITTY GUITAR . The harmonies are all over DANGER BIRD, a lost epic. BARSTOOL BLUES, STUPID GIRL, DRIVE BACK all killer , but the REAL KILLER is CORTEZZZZZZZ. SO VERY NASTY, I've never heard more distortion in a slow moving ballad in my life (it works extremely well).<br />NEIL YOUNG with his friends CRAZY HORSE invented grunge music and this album is a great example of that type of stuff.<br />The last track is a CSNY track that doesn't really belong but whatever. Forget it or don't, the rest of this album gets an easy 5 in my book.
B00005JODA|3.0|I didn't dislike \\"The Constant Gardener\\", but given it's critical buzz, it didn't live up to my expectations. In it, a British conservative bureaucrat marries a liberal activist who becomes involved in uncovering a pharmaceutical corporation conspiracy. She tries to prove impoverished Africans are being used to test new dangerous pharmaceuticals.<br /><br />Director Fernando Meirelles (City Of God), films a glorious, remote and colorful country focussing on the poor, highlighted by aerial panoramas of red-baked seaside cliffs, green roving, grassy plains, and raw images of ingenious peoples and locales. The cinematography overwhelms the topical but standard suspense-thriller story, becoming nearly condescending in it's constant touting of the real poor in Africa. The enormity and plight of starving diseased Africans stands like a giant next to the fictitious, and often thin, characterizations of the two lead characters.<br /><br />I couldn't buy the character of Tessa, as a humanitarian activist. Her character is flighty, a bleeding heart if you will, without roots to empathetic response to human suffering. She is more like a Peace Corp volunteer than a genuine activist. The emotional intention of the film may be to depict her as sweet and naive, but her superficial probing and brow bending suspicions, blunted a sharp edge the film may have possessed, had her character been more secure in responding to abusive global corporations.<br /><br />Despite these reservations, the second half of \\"The Constant Gardener\\", improves over the first considerably, as the 'suspense-thriller' dynamics are set into gear, and the chase, so to speak, is on. Before then, the constant merry-go-round romantics of the starry-eyed lead characters become superfluous and annoying. He loved, loved, loved her, with all his heart, heart, heart. We get, get, get it.<br /><br />As in his \\"City Of God\\", concerning the slums of Brazil, director Meirelles photographs a stunning human vista of a suffering and splendorous Africa. The conspiracy thriller aspect of it, is often only secondary.of a suffering and splendorous Africa. The conspiracy thriller aspect of it, is often only secondary.
B00063EMJ6|4.0|Yes, Neil Young ain't as popular with the kids like he once was.<br />I saw Neil Young in concert in 1996 when I got a free ticket from somebody who couldn't go. I had no idea who he was or what he was about but the show blew me away. Thats how I became a fan.<br /><br />There is a ton of great stuff in the Neil Young file but only now is there a single disc sampler of stuff to convert the kids.<br /><br />DECADE, which is a two disc package which only spans the years 66-76 was previously the only thing closest to a greatest hits up until now. While I like that album, it does have a lot of different stuff that may throw off new listeners.<br /><br />This mix is more compact and contains w wider range of songs- All of which are Neil Young staples. If this doesn't convert you into a Neil Young fan nothing will.<br /><br />SO WHAT DO WE GET? Well, to start we get both early Neil Young epics DOWN BY THE RIVER and COWGIRL IN THE SAND. These two really jam, Neil Young has a crazy guitar style that pre dates grunge, really raw, and at its best on these two tracks. Ditto CINNAMON GIRL.<br />HELPLESS is a soft number done with CROSBY STILLS AND NASH. Aside from being a electric guitar wiz, Neil shows us a little lesson in acoustic folky type music. Great tune. The next one AFTER THE GOLD RUSH is another mellow one and then he throws a little piano at you with a groovy ONLY LOVE CAN BREAK YOUR HEART.<br /><br />SOUTHERN MAN and OHIO are a pair of rockers, then the bone chilling heroin ode NEEDLE AND THE DAMAGE DONE. Awesome lyrics on that one. OLD MAN and HEART OF GOLD are great songs too.<br />LIKE A HURRICANE contains some more firey guitar jammin', you get HEY HEY MY MY and MY MY HEY HEY both from RUST NEVER SLEEPS. More awesome lyrics on these, one acoustic and one electric (you gotta have both). Most of the eighties is left behind (who cares) but we get the huge '89 hit ROCKIN IN THE FREE WORLD and we wrap it up with the slow acoustic midnight ballad HARVEST MOON.<br /><br />All in all a very nice mix.

I study in this area and read lots of other similar type writings, I rate this as one of the very best.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I have used this particular tape/dvd for 9 years.  I think it is a challenging workout.  If I'm doing other cardio, often I will only do the strength and abs portion.  Even if you only use the strength and abs portion, this dvd is worth it.
B000AA4M9U|4.0|BB King and friends at 80 is a bluesfans dream. BB is with some of the best blues musicians in the business.  <br />BB King and \\"Lucille\\" do duets with Billy Gibbons, Eric Clapton, Bobby Bland,Mark Knopfler to name a few. <br />It is fun to hear the ZZ Top guitarist perform with BB King, well worth the price of admission. <br />Eric Clapton and BB are togther for \\"The Thrill is gone\\". <br />What is fun about this is the exchange of guitar licks between Clapton and BB King. <br />There are also several other big names appearing with BB King such as Sheryl Crow. Glenn Frey of the Eagles, Van Morrision and Elton John with his Boogie Woogie piano. <br />The CD is primarily blues songs that are done very well. <br />BB King is 80 now but you would never guess it. <br />File this under \\"F\\" for fun.
B000AP04EW|5.0|this movie is freakin fantastic! i thought it was a kick- a** movie. i dont know why people didnt get the plot. i got it, dont take it so damn seriously. chemistry is totally out there between the two couples. acton scenes and stunts were nicely done. pick up the dvd when it comes out. wont be desapointed! <br /> <br />typed by her daughter colette &lt;----------- xD
B00000JGOJ|1.0|I was so looking forward to rewarching this movie after having not seen it for severals year. a third of a way through it, it starting to skip and freeze. I played it all the way through but took forever. At the ending it was workinhg again., But I missed a great deal of the movie because of the dmage. I guess you get what you pat for when you get it through someone and its used. Won't be doing this again!
B000ASATZ8|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Tremors movies, and am very excited to see a box set funally being released. The first movie is excellent, the foundation for many good sci-fi/fantasy movies, the beginning is slow enough to actually introduce the movie, but exciting enough to have you hooked, then comes Tremors 2: Aftershocks, new setting, new challenge, new characters, same classic storyline and still has Micheal Gross as Burt Gummer, the match made in heaven for an actor to a part. Tremors 3: Back to Perfection, back to the original detting with a few new characters and yet another exciting twist and an all new way to save the day. Then comes Tremors 4: The Legend Begins, One of the only good prequels in movies to date. All this for only $26 list price? An excellent buy.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This was the first within an epic trilogy of recent films that has very quickly become my three topmost favorite Batman movies of all-time. \\"Batman Begins\\" portrays and fleshes out the story of Gotham City's Dark Knight in the meticulous manner this character has always deserved. Christopher Nolan, as well as everybody else who gave of their time and dedication, deserves a well-earned pat on the back. This movie sponges away the bitter candy-coated aftertaste left in the wake of \\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman & Robin,\\" and gives us the brooding, formidable Caped Crusader we have all longed for since Tim Burton's landmark original.<br /><br />Nolan's extraordinary film takes us back to Bruce Wayne's troubled past, to all of the intermingling events that led to his parents' abrupt murders. Haunted by their deaths well into the years of young adulthood, he flees Gotham to travel the world; to try and make sense of what his life has become. His ongoing desperation to uncover a means of battling the injustice of his personal loss leads him to the doorstep of Rhaz Al' Ghoul and the \\"League of Shadows,\\" a secret society of warriors that collectively shapes and molds Bruce into something the residents of Gotham City might very well have never seen before.<br /><br />Do not look for any of the corny, kid-friendly scenarios from the kitschy Adam West series, because it is not here. This is as fantastically serious and emotionally gripping of a Batman film as you are ever likely to find. From start to finish, I was completely captivated. Christian Bale IS Batman. It's a role he was clearly born to play. This film also boasts the impressive talents of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Rutger Hauer, AND Cillian Murphy; just an absolutely incredible and altogether irreplaceable cast of awesome actors.<br /><br />This captured everything, the entire all-important essence of what watching these types of movies is all about. It really is THAT damn good!<br /><br/>And, just so we're clear, I want that Batmobile! I've been watching these movies from the day I was eighteen years old and I can testify, with all clarity, that I have never been so totally wowed by any one vehicle in my entire life! This isn't a car, it's a TANK!<br /><br />Believe me when I say, if you have ever followed this character's journey through the comics pages or within any of the prior unrelated films, you ABSOLUTELY MUST see \\"Batman Begins.\\" It is, in every conceivable manner, a game-changing five-star classic.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I just heard an NPR story on the issue of DRM & cd copying and they played some of this. It is terrible. Why would anyone even want to waste bandwidth downloading this for free, let alone actually paying money for it?
B00005JNEI|5.0|I enjoyed watching the movie as it's very informative. The chronicle of events prior to 9/11 and afterwards is fascinating. The most intriguing aspect is why the Bin Laden family was flown out of US minutes after the attack. I've already recommended it to my friends. <br /> <br />Zib Abu
B00003CXCT|5.0|Just like DaVinci's work all artist hopes to keep his work intact from time, all good painting suffers from getting old and lose color, brightness and contrast, in this case also sound, Lucas did an excellent job recovering every frame of this trilogy to make it fix the time where the audience feel the need of better sound and detailed image quality, and in this case recall an excellent story in a galaxy far, far away...

0887306667|5.0|This book is a page turner. It's like the DaVinci Code of marketing books. (Except it doesn't take place in France.) <br /> <br />It's a quick read. And it hammers home the same basic message about branding. Because Ries uses dozens of real-world examples to prove his point, it's a joy to read. <br /> <br />I haven't read a lot of marketing books. So I'm not an expert. But after reading this book, I feel like I know the basic truth about branding and can apply it to any situation. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.
B0009QBLA8|5.0|In order to enjoy Eraserhead, you must be willing to watch a movie that is almost completely devoid of joy and is so deep and personal that it's painful to watch. If you prefer to watch typical Hollywood fare - action movies, chick flicks, whatever - this is probably not the film for you. I don't mean that to sound elitist, I'm just trying to be honest so you know what you are getting into. <br /> <br />This is not a film to take lightly, and I strongly disagree with a previous reviewer that it is not worth deeper analysis since it is a student art film. On the contrary, the movie is an intense reflection on director David Lynch's fears of fatherhood and a perfect landscape to deeply analyze shallow sex, an unhappy marriage, regret, pain, insanity and redemption. The movie is filled with symbolism, motifs and metaphors. In fact, the movie itself is basically a metaphor. <br /> <br />Actually, I would recommend that people rent this movie before they buy it. It is pricey, and it is definitely an acquired taste. <br /> <br />I find similarly intense thematic and metaphoric parallels (musically) in Neutral Milk Hotel's album \\"In the Aeroplane over the Sea\\", and (literarily) in Chris Ware's graphic novel \\"Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth.\\" I recommend these to fans of Eraserhead. <br /> <br />It took five years for David Lynch to finish Eraserhead; despite the low budget, Lynch's movie is very professional and is truly a labored work of art and subtlety. And it will leave you very disturbed. If you are ok with that, please try it. It's not for everyone, but for those who give it a chance, you will be greatly rewarded. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0783219695|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This movie is a dramatized version of the real life near-tragedy of Apollo 13.<br /><br />Apollo 13 was the third mission to land men on the Moon and the Apollo program's first aborted mission.  An explosion in one of the oxygen tanks crippled the spacecraft during flight.  The Lunar Module (used only to land on the Moon) was used to provide emergency propulsion and life support after the loss of the service module system.  The crew was forced to just orbit the Moon and return to Earth.<br /><br />Here are the facts of the Apollo 13 (AS-508) mission:<br /><br />(1) Lunar Module: Aquarius<br />(2) Command and Service Module: Odyssey<br />(3) Crew: Commander Jim Lovell, Command Module pilot Jack Swigert**, Lunar Module pilot: Fred Haise<br />(4) Launch: April 11, 1970<br />(5) Landing site: near Fra Mauro (one of the Moon's craters)<br />(6) Returned to Earth: April 17, 1970<br /><br />** The initial pilot Tom Mattingly was removed 72 hours prior to launch due to presumed exposure to German measles.  (He later flew on Apollo 16.)<br /><br />Director Ron Howard has taken these bare facts (and the book \\"Lost Moon\\" co-authored by Jim Lovell who served as technical consultant on this movie) and made an unforgettable adventure, drama, and history movie using state-of-the-art special effects and ingenious movie-making techniques.<br /><br />There are actually three stories in this movie:<br /><br />(1) The astronauts struggle to stay alive<br />(2) The controlled chaos at NASA who try to solve the numerous problems caused by the explosion<br />(3) The trauma faced by the astronaut's families<br /><br />The acting is superb.  Tom Hanks as Lovell and Ed Harris as Mission Control Director Gene Kranz give especially good performances.  Also look for the fine performance of Gary Sinise as bumped astronaut Ken Mattingly.  Ron Howard does not make the mistake of letting the special effects upstage these terrific performances.  (Ron Howard's real-life mother also has a role in this movie.)<br /><br />Another highlight of this movie is the actual historical news footage that was used.  Look for people like Neil Armstrong (the first person to set foot on the Moon in July, 1969) as well as Jim and Marilyn Lovell among this footage.<br /><br />The movie ends with Hanks as Lovell summarizing the \\"seven extraordinary days of Apollo 13\\" and he ends his summary with this statement:<br /><br />\\"I look up at the Moon and wonder when we will be going back and who will that be?\\"<br /><br />Finally, the anniversary edition DVD is flawless with respect to picture and sound quality.  It has eight interesting extras.  The most notable extra is that the entire movie is also presented in IMAX.<br /><br />In conclusion, be sure to see this incredible movie and see why it was nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture!!<br /><br />(1995;  2 hr 20 min;  widescreen;  2 discs)<br /><br />+++++as a role in this movie.)<br /><br />Another highlight of this movie is the actual historical news footage that was used.

B000001FB6|4.0|...and sadly, their last real great album. <br /> <br />By 1984, heavy metal rock was being largely dominated by bubble gum MTV hair bands like Quiot Riot, Ratt and the Scorpions (give me a break, will you!!!)  Deep Purple managed to hold onto their heavy rock sound and image and score great tracks like \\"Knockin' At Your Back Door\\", \\"Nobody Home\\", \\"Mean Streak\\" and the title track.
B00005JKES|5.0|a review of a work this profound, multi-faceted and complex on every level is simply bound to be a failure. however, there are bits of thoughts and feelings that can be told, which can serve as an introduction to twin peaks.     first of all, when approaching twin peaks, and the same goes for all of david lynch's work, one shouldn't be focused primarily on the \\"story\\". story is a mere vehicle for something much more profound, utterly mysterious and magical that makes the very essence of twin peaks.     i find the true meaning of twin peaks in its myriad of completely self-sufficient scenes. for example, a character walking through a woods is self-sufficient - its meaning is not in the place where the character is going and arrival, but in the process of going there itself. looking at the texture of a red curtain in slo-mo, with a musical drone in background is self-sufficient, utterly psychedelic, transcendental and completely meaningful in its lack of reason. to hear twin peaks, one needs primarily heart and imagination, not reason. that is not to say that these two forces are at war with each other, quite the opposite. to be open to colour, sound, experience of all that which can be experienced is essential for being able to fully comprehend twin peaks.    one might argue that this self-sufficiency of scenes is just non-substantial aesthetic indulgence. i don't think it is. these scenes are completely substantial, but they cannot properly be talked about, they have to be experienced. they are clear in my head and spirit, but are not clear in my words. that's why you have to experience this for yourself. david lynch has said that he views his movies as music. music is a large part of twin peaks. but this is not the point - the point is that the visual scenes themselves are musical - the way that camera moves, the way scenes follow one another, the logic of that which is filmed in the scenes and when.    so, the death of laura palmer, and that which at first seems like an ordinary investigation - that's really not even close to being central for twin peaks. this investigation itself is, which becomes clear pretty soon in the series, a metaphysical investigation, an investigation of values, feelings, of good and evil, and earthly happenings are just mere manifestations of these metaphysical forces. this is the true depth of twin peaks. truly disturbing, truly loving and lovely, truly different...all at once. always all at once - and that's very powerful.    so... if you like to feel and think and have high aesthetic values, you'll love twin peaks.    unfortunately, in this pack you'll get only first 7 episodes, since that's all that's been released on dvd until now. but the production of the set is beautiful, high quality stuff.
B000002LA2|3.0|Complete with synthysisers, drum machines and Tina Turner, this EC release comes off like pure late '80s MTV pop! <br /> <br />The two hits, \\"It's In The Way That You Use It\\" and \\"Tearin' Us Apart\\" are undenyably enjoyable, but the rest you only tolerate because it's Eric Clapton.  But even that much slack can only go so far when compared to rest of his career. <br /> <br />His next release, \\"The Journeyman\\" put him back in top form!
B0000DD7UC|5.0|Trouble, yeah, screams Pink. Yeah the trouble is that i can get enough of here.  If God is a Dj, this is what he wants to play, when youre are in the dimension in between heaven and hell. This Cd has so many highpoints, that its difficult to choose one. But Walk away is my favourite Track 12, and also Track 8 Save my Life. So what is it with Walk Away . Its  so likeable to like, after just one listening. The lyrics is like a short story. ( You had my heart, you had my soul. You had it all-didnt  you  ?). I still have Pink !. I realy look forward to the DVD from here European tour. Pink rules !
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|wether there was a purpose behind making final fantasy VII sequel still leaves me`befuddled, and alas ive come to the conclusion it was just a wet sloppy kiss to the fans looking to see cloud jsut go around slashing things. I dont know I probablly excepted too much, but an over complicated uninvolving story, Poor Pacing, Ludacrious action sequences, silly dialogue and inch deep charachter depth really wasnt what should have been expected but is what became of it. Theres about hour worth of story which in excess to the rest of the running time is padded with ridicluous action scenes (i dont recall the charachters being able to fly). And the little and no invlovement of the chracters is a let down. Its really sad because to the eye it for the most time pleases and the cgi maybe some of the best ive ever seen. aside from the ham fisted action there is a general atmospheric touch to the visuals and the quiter scenes display good sense of mood that aid those touches. But it could've been alot more.  The movie spends most of the time trying distract me from its fatal flaws. at times it works, but more consitently it doesnt, and i see what little emphasis in what made the game so endearing:the story and charcters.(the game play certainly helped but this is a movie so..)
B00005RFAI|5.0|Get the party started. Yeah right !. Pink got the x-factor what some artists have, and some don`t. It`s here raw voice which does it, and when the music also sounds great, its the ultimate fusion, in a way. Track 3 Missundaztood shows that she has a voice that  fit`s in , whatsoever. I like hear screaming on this one at the end of track, and here laughter after.  (This is my first singel, she says with laughter, and the laughter is so raw and sexy that it turns you on, even if youre out of Viagra and castrated). The ultimate experience on this one is track 9 with Aerosmiths Steve Tyler, the duet Misery. It makes me shiver. The two voices click in to harmony, right on. Track 12. My Vietnam is another winner. So to speak. Great tunes, great voice, The ultimate Pink experience.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A friend of mine lent me the first disk in the TV series DVD set and told me I should take a look.  I am surprised I did not see this TV series when it was on the air, but then again I rarely watch TV.  However, Firefly is a show worth planning on being in front of the TV for.  The cast and writers have done an excellent job of character development.  In just a pilot and first two episodes, the characters are well defined and likeable.<br /><br />I have always thought of science fiction and space travel in terms of Star Trek (happy people in space!)  Firefly takes a slightly more dim view of humanity's future and the government (a.k.a. The Alliance).  And, I never thought I would see someone ride up to a space ship on horseback or a space ship flying over the top of a train. But, the series works, the characters are great, and the special effects/sets are realistic and convincing.<br /><br />Fox took a show with great potential and really screwed it up.  We \\"fans-come-lately\\" can only hope that another network picks it up.
B00004RHZU|4.0|So cute, so good lookin, so raw and unpolished. You can hear here humming voice on Split Personality and you know that this artist has something to tell. The voice has a pain in side, as she realy means what she sings. Some other artists dont, belive me. This album from 2000 is here debut album. The reason why i dont give it a 5 star, is that some tracks is a bit \\"unstable\\" and doesn't have the quality which surley comes on here next album Missundaztood. Track 4<br /><br />There you go, is one of my favourites. It`s so rytmic that my feets starts to tap hysterically'. But the voice. Everytime she speaks, she has that Janis Joplin inspired voice, which gives that makes me shiver in  a good way.  Its a pity i can`t take here home. She has star quality all over.<br /><br />Track 12 Hiccup is another winner. A must in youre Pink Collection. The dreamgirl next door, with a voice from another planet, which is difficult to describe in words. Track 10 Stop Falling is a sweetie two.
B000002UAR|5.0|After hearing the CD reissue of Revolver, is anybody as mad as I am about what Capitol records did to the Beatle's early albums? For those of you too young to remember, they gutted the English versions, deleting two or three songs and then reissuing these in lame compilations that did not do justice to the original albums. Nowhere did this affect an album worse than Revolver. It's why it's suddenly started to appear at the top of people's list of great albums: some of us never heard it until ten years ago.  The loser in this travesty, besides the consumer, was John Lennon. Lennon was at the nadir of his popularity because he told the truth and said the Beatles were bigger than God. (not greater - more popular) So they cut out some of the best music on the record, notably \\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" a masterpiece. John's acerbic pessimism would have been a perfect balance to Paul's chipper warblings (\\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" is not a bad tune, but it's better when it's balanced by \\"Dr. Roberts\\".  Add to that some of the greatest songs in pop history (Eleanor Rigby, For No One, Here There and Everywhere, Good Day Sunshine), plus a strong effort from George (Taxman) and some experimental noodling that anticipated Sgt. Pepper (Tomorrow Never Knows), throw in Yellow Submarine for the kiddies and you've got yourself a true classic. I'm not one of those who think Revolver is the best Beatles album - I give the nod to Abbey Road for superior musicianship - but it's dang close. And that's good enough for just about anybody.

B000055Y0X|5.0|This is possibly the best film from one of our most brilliant and iconoclastic directors. It just shows that you can make total annihilation flat-out funny. Peter Sellers is amazing, and George C. Scott deservedly made a name for himself here.  Unfortunately, the film is not outdated, as its message is all too relevant to the world today. But don't worry about. If we all have to go, let's go like Slim Pickens did, ridin' that baby into the face of oblivion. And let's have a good laugh while we do it.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I love crazy movies and I thought this was well written and performed. I never would have guessed the outcome. I love movies where I have to say \\"how are they ever going to end this movie\\" and the ending turns out shocking!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I can say that I am a fan of the game and I was not disappointed at all with the movie, yes some of the characters werent in the movie as often as I'd hope they would, but the story was fun, the action breathtaking and the cgi just astounding! I loved seeing my favourite characters come to life in such a spectacular way. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the game. Those people who sadly havnt played the game would probably confused, unless someone explained some things to them as the movie went on.

0330483285|5.0|John Banville has produced an incredible book in \\"The Sea\\". Here he has a person Max Morden who has returned to the coastal town where he spends his holiday to confront his ghosts. He has lost his wife to cancer. Everywhere around, the language protrays the death initially beautifully. He cannot be rid of it. It is a sense of longing and trying to cling to the past, which can be addictive. The passion with which he describes his wife is wonderful, he leaves to image his wife and relationship that he would have had with her. The prose in the book is outstanding.  <br /> <br />As in all cases, he remembers another family from his past when he was very young, the Graces, who he thinks are very glamorous, he is torn between life and death.  The complete landscape is an anatomy of life and death and is beautifully portrayed. The book is an increadible one, though sad at times. It shows the variety and depth of the author and how deeply he describes scenes to make us see the analogies between the scenes and the moods of the person. This is one of the best novels of the year and a pleasure to read. Some of the best parts of the book are where he compares the changes that happened in the world, specifically with marriage. In his time, he had no problem with marrying his wife despite all the pros and cons that he faced. The present day world prefers taking partners. Now he has a beautiful paragraph that says partners used to refer to someone you dance or to a person you have a business with, how did it come to refer to someone you love. After all it is true that the amount of commitment one has for a business or for a dancer is much less than for a person whom one has married to. The other place that will break your heart is where his wife when she is ill starts to tell that there where times in the past when they were human and used to hate each other, implying that they are not human anymore. One relishes the story as much as the way it is portrayed. To put it in the author's language, this is no quotidian book and every chapter has uniqueness that one would go back and reread.
B000001GAO|5.0|With the world's huge library of music, how many of us could pick only a few CD's of music with which to be left on a deserted island?  It is quite hard or impossible to do this really, but Mozart's Requiem simply has to be one of these for those who love classical music. The emotions that flow out of this final composition are quite strong, and the vocalists, as well as Leonard Bernstein's direction of the symphony brings these out. The fact that Mozart did not complete the piece before he died in 1791 does not detract from it, and in fact lends mystery to how, and for whom it was completed.
B000058983|5.0|i've read so many of the other reviews and where do i start. i'm glad that most like it and it saddens me when others miss out. just a psychadelic relic? folk this and trippy lyrics that? so much more. to appreciate this record you need to downtune and get sensitive like you never have before. yes it is sprawling, 1st side of da capo is a more traditional punch to the solar plexus, but there are moments of beauty and i mean the most beautiful moments on record waiting around every turn. everyone who loves this record is in tune with this. \\"old man\\" achingly beautiful yes! takes you beyond what you thought beautiful could sound like.   <br />when i bought this lp i spent every available waking moment with it for a week straight. it made my entire record collection obsolete. you see, compared to a guy like arthur lee who wasn't ashamed to bare his very soul, every other record i owned became very superficial.  arthur lee was the only one who took off his clothes at the nudist colony. even an original expressionist like little feat's lowell george hid his very self behind humor, wit and irony. all good but compared to this here music his exceptional art seems ordinary. <br />with the intro to \\"alone again or\\" rising in three notes of the scale out of nothingness this record lets you know right away not to expect the usual. it expresses each section with intensity and focus and god is in its details. rocking numbers? house is not a motel has real drive and, as others have said, the mariachi style horn solos are kind of like something you have heard before (herb alpert) but really like nothing you have heard before. not in that context. too many facets on the record to mention here. arthur lee singing andmorreagan? some people are given something so originally beautiful and complain because he is not a \\"great\\" singer. whitney houston is a \\"great\\" singer. whitney houston's soul is locked up someplace where neither of us will ever hear it. i will stop there and let everyone else describe their favorite moments.   <br />just a piece of psychadelia? compared to moody blues? days of future passed is bland bland and is just another example of a record that reveals nothing of consequence when listened to under the same magnification as you can forever changes. comparisons to the grateful dead? this lp requires you to LISTEN, not just zone out and go to your happy place as deadheads do.  <br />i recently gave this cd, and a great lp cover t-shirt, to a friend. if he asks me to give him more music like this i will have to tell him there is not another album out there like it.  <br />the ONLY thing on this earth that has altered the way i think and express myself since becoming an adult is love's forever changes. at the young age of 19 i was shown by arthur lee and bryan maclean that a real man can describe his feelings in the most outrageous and tender ways. i too envy those who get to spend their first week with forever changes. i hope my friend likes it.

B000AL730O|5.0|Thirteen gorgeous 3-4 minute songs.  It's like listening to Rubber Soul for the first time again.  You're not going to find any rockers here but the songs, performances, arrangements and production are stunning.  Up until this CD Paul had released (in my opinion) 4 five star albums (Band on the Run, Tug of War, Flowers in the Dirt, Flaming Pie).  Chaos and Creation takes it's rightful place alongside those great works.
B00005JODA|3.0|Another \\"Interpreter\\"-esque drama about the plight of Africa and the West's role in exacerbating it. This concept has been revisted countless times while the theme in which it's been explored hardly changed. This is the first problem with the film: tired concept.<br /><br />Performances were good, not great. The characters were believable, yet detached. Everything is very subdued and watered down a little bit.<br /><br />The soundtrack is really cool. It features several African songs that are very haunting and so very beautiful. The score is very expressive as well. Well done in this department.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is very forgetable. It doesn't bode well for a drama when it fails to move you emotionally. There were solid moments here and there, but after all said and done, the fact remains that this is a movie that had so much potential which the director/producers didn't foster.<br /><br />Rent it when it comes out on DVD.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Despite having one of the worst band names of all time, Death Cab has put out a really great album.  I have a few friends who are die-hard indie rock schmoes, and there's no doubt in my mind that the people who like music because it's under the radar are going to have big problems with this album. <br /> <br />I think this album is fantastic.  Having been introduced to Death Cab by the aforementioned indie friends, I was never hugely impressed by their past work, and never gave it much of a shot.  The music on Plans seems, to me at least, substantially more accessible.  The vocals are a bit flat, and fit better into a produced soundscape than their more organic roots. <br /> <br />As an aside, it's also refreshing to enjoy a popular album that has identifiable themes - loss and the passage of time are prevelant subjects that many of the songs address. <br /> <br />Overall, I find this album a steady, mellow presence that sounds good loud or quiet, a pleasant fit for the nostalgic, retrospective mood that comes with autumn.

B00005JNNZ|4.0|This inspirational sports movie is a little bit Hoosiers and a little bit Dangerous Minds.  It tells the true story of Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson), a former high school basketball star who returns to his alma mater, Richmond (CA) High School, to coach the struggling basketball team.  From the beginning, Coach Carter has high hopes for his team.  He makes players sign contracts, promising to be great students as well as great athletes-intending to help them break out of the school's high drop-out rates and low college acceptance rates. <br /> <br />On the court, the team excels beyond anyone's expectations, and the team wins game after game.  But then the academic reports come in-and Carter realizes that several of his students aren't keeping up the academic end of the deal.  In a move that's highly unpopular with students, parents, and even the school board, Carter forces his team to meet in the library instead of the gym.  He cancels practices and games until the whole team is back to the standards that he expects of his players-even though the board threatens to go over his head and cut the chains that keep the gym closed. <br /> <br />Coach Carter is a compelling film about a man who devoted himself to improving the future of his community-not just to winning the game.  Though it definitely isn't the kind of movie that I typically enjoy, I enjoyed it.  It's fast-paced and action-packed, but it's also moving at the same time.  Anyone who loves basketball won't want to miss the perfectly-choreographed game scenes-though they may seem a bit long for non-hoops-fans.  It's not just for sports fans, though-the story is a powerful one for anyone.  It's a great reminder that there still are a few good, caring people left in the world.   <br /> <br />Be sure to check out the special features-especially the making-of documentary and the interviews with the real people behind the story.

B00005QFE5|5.0|The Road Home is best meant for the big screen.  We get a taste of beautiful fall countryside and winter snow; this cinematography is special.  What is ironic is that the parts of  the movie in present time are black and white, while the past is in vivid color. There isn't a lot of dialogue, and the subtitles are very easy to read.<br /><br />A man is summoned back home to North China because his father has died.  He listens carefully to follow the wishes of his mother whose devotion is to bury him in exact tradition.  She settles for nothing less.  There is a need to hire younger men to carry the body.  Determined, she wants his body carried through the journey on the road that was part of their love affair. It is so he \\"won't forget his way home.\\"<br /><br />Then, in backflash, we learn the love story when a beautiful young girl, Di, who sets her eye on a schoolteacher who arrives from the city.  He helps build the school, the women each cook a dish for the workers, and she tries to get his attention by hopes that he picks her food on the lunch table.  Di follows him through the countryside as he walks the children home. She draws water from the well close to the school to get a glimpse of him.<br /><br />Then, abruptly, he is called away to the city for political questioning.  He promises to come home and it is two years that they have been apart.<br /><br />The Road Home is on Time magazine's 100 best films.  Zhang Yimou also directed other award winning movies, Red Sorghum, Ju Dou and Raise the Red Lanturn, Note One Less, To Live, etc.<br /><br />This is a tender, clean love story. .....Rizzo
B00005JNBQ|1.0|A lot of people have rated this film highly at IMDB.Com. It just serves to once more reinforce my belief that you do not want to be swayed by the majority, but my curiosity got the better of me, and so I rented it. <br /> <br />This was one of the most over-rated, boring, unfunny film I have ever ran across. It made me feel that the film was made by and for retards. Much as I tried, I couldn't see what's funny in it, and found myself trying to laugh it out, until I realized that the joke was on me! A Horribly STUPID movie!
B00004VVNB|4.0|This was a very nice movie to watch, even twenty or thirty years after I had first seen it. It has that special charm of out-dated SF movies and I enjoyed watching it again. The characters appearing in the film are many-layered, funny and simply interesting. Young Michael York is both energetic and contemplative, both in good measure. The girl and the old man are charming. The visuals were stunning at the time of release, and still are if You do not require 4-5 explosions per scene and jumpy directing. The film is even erotic to some point. The plot suffers some faults, but not as many as most modern movies. Both picture and sound on the DVD are fine. There are not many specials on the DVD, but since these are mostly boring, I do not object to that. Strongly recommended.
B000AL730O|4.0|The haunting \\"Jenny Wren\\" is a beautiful ballad that Sir Paul  McCartney has described as \\"sort of a son of 'Blackbird'\\" but it probably owes as much to \\"Elenaor Rigby\\" or \\"She's Leaving Home\\" or countless other McCartney classics. He has no rival when it comes to lonely women. <br /> <br />And what's wrong with that? I'd like to know ... <br /> <br />Macca has an amazing back-catalogue of beautiful ballads into which \\"Jenny Wren\\" will settle in nicely. The only shame is that a younger generation out there probably wouldn't get to hear it unless someone younger covered it. \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" is a lovely melody featuring Macca's voice at it's best. as for the rest of the album while i don't go in for the breatheless enthusiasm of some reviewers, I reckon it's a very good serious work by Macca.
0333581075|4.0|Publishing this novel in 1978, Greene says in his autobiography (Ways of Escape, pp. 256 - 257) that he had actually started it ten years earlier, abandoning it when his friend and former colleague, Kim Philby, defected to Russia. He did not want this book to be considered a roman a clef. Like Philby, Maurice Castle, the main character in this novel, is a double agent, and Greene goes to great pains to bring him to life and try to make his inevitable defection to Russia believable. Having earlier lived in South Africa, Castle had fallen in love with Sarah, an African woman. Another double agent had helped her escape from South Africa so she and Castle could be married. Now living in England with Sarah and their son, Castle continues to provide information to the Russians as payback for the help he received years before.<br /><br />The cloak-and-dagger intrigue here is rooted in the Cold War, and Greene's own sympathies with the Communists, well known, are noticeable throughout the novel. When a leak is suspected in Castle's section of British intelligence, a secret plan is devised to eliminate the culprit quietly to avoid another Philby-type embarrassment to the government. It is of only minor consequence to the higher-ups that they kill Davis, an innocent man. The Russian' rush to \\"save\\" Castle, whose work for them has really been of only minor importance, seems more like wishful thinking than reality. Codes created from duplicate copies of old books, messages left in a hollow tree, and warning signals made with rings of the telephone now seem to belong to an age much earlier than the mere 24 years which have evolved since the book's publication.<br /><br />Castle is well drawn, for the most part, though he seems a rather clumsy agent-about-to-defect, someone who, though supposedly devoted to his wife and child, has not thought far enough ahead to guarantee their ultimate safety and happiness. Sarah, unfortunately, is an undifferentiated, flat character, and Castle's devotion to her must be accepted, rather than felt, thereby limiting the impact of the ending. Parts of the book are very moving, and Castle is often a sympathetic character, but I thought the book lacked the philosophical and structural tightness of his earlier, more famous novels.

0553382179|5.0|I am a big FlyLady fan. I find her website is much more complete and detailed than this book is.  I don't think you can really follow her system by using only this book.  The website really gets me off of my \\"Franny\\" and motivates me because of all of those annoying (LOL) daily e-mails.  The book is handy when you need a refresher and you don't have access to a computer or don't have time to get on the web.  Also if you like things in printed form (like I do), you will enjoy adding this book to your library.  Word of caution, those emails can be overwhelming sometimes--you get many in a single day--and when I am too busy or stressed to read my e-mails, I turn to the book for my routines.  I would encourage you to take the book out of the library to see what you think before you invest in it.  The system is fabulous--baby steps towards getting your home and your life organized.  The book is a condensed version of the website.  You can really get all you need from the site, so if you are an avid internet user, you really don't need the book.  You can simply print out the pages off of the web and put them into a binder.  I like the book anyway.
0452287022|4.0|Art lovers, and particularly Vermeer lovers, have had two \\"Vermeer novels\\" available for the past few years, Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier and Girl in Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland.  Both are short, both are well written, both involve a hypnotizingly seductive Vermeer painting, and both tell of the influence of the painting on the lives of the main characters.  As for which is better, that may be a matter of taste, though Girl with the Pearl Earring has had the lion's share of publicity, especially after the production of the film.  Many readers will be interested in reading both novels.<br /><br />In Girl With A Pearl Earring, author Chevalier focuses her literary microscope on Griet, a maid in the Vermeer household who becomes an assistant to the painter. Griet is a young woman who maintains her integrity despite the turbulence and social pressures to which she is subjected in the household. Life in Delft and in this family during the time of the painting is replete with petty jealousies, economic pressures, class distinctions, religious differences, and political and social uncertainty, and Griet has to navigate her way through this milieu. It is through her character and domestic situation that one comes to know Vermeer and his painting.<br /><br />The second Vermeer novel, Girl in Hyacinth Blue, on the other hand, is not a \\"character novel.\\" Here the author does not concentrate on one character or even the painting as an end in itself. Instead, Vreeland takes a broader, more global view, using the history of a hitherto undiscovered Vermeer painting to work backward from the present to the painting's inception in Delft. The \\"story\\" here is a careful tracing of themes--the relationship between personal love and responsibility to mankind in general, the role of art in the lives of ordinary people, and what constitutes lasting value both in art and in human interactions. In seven or eight chapters we see how the painting has affected the lives of its various owners.<br /><br />Ultimately, comparing these beautifully wrought novels is like comparing pearl earrings to hyacinths. Both are gorgeous; each is unique. Girl with the Pearl Earring is more accessible and more popular, while Girl in Hyacinth Blue is more complex and literary.  Lovers of Vermeer are encouraged to read both--and enjoy.

B00009P1O2|5.0|Freddie Mercury may be gone, but his indominatable spirit lives on in this dvd of what may well Queen's single greatest live performance ever. Freddie's unbeatable showmanship is on full display here. Whether he's crooning a ballad like \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\", screaming out a rocker like \\"Hammer To Fall\\" or just making small talk with the audience, Freddie holds the crowd in the palm of his hand and never loses his grip. The rest of the band is one fire as well, especially guitarist Brian May, but this is Freddie's show. And what a show it is. I haven't watched the extras on disc two yet, but frankly who needs too (even though they'll probably be great). All you need to really see is Freddie.
0099429799|5.0|Though this book is only of average length, it has the feel of a big family saga, so completely does McEwan delve into the consciousness of his main characters as they attempt to cope with the long-term repercussions of a \\"crime\\" committed by a Briony Tallis, a naïve 13-year-old with a \\"controlling demon.\\" Briony's \\"wish for a harmonious, organised world denie[s] her the reckless possibilities of wrongdoing,\\" so it is doubly ironic that her attempt to \\"fix\\" what she sees as wrongdoing involving her sister and Robbie Turner, a childhood friend, becomes, in itself, a wrongdoing, one she feels compelled to deny and for which she will eventually attempt to atone.<br /><br />Opening the novel in 1935, McEwan creates an intense, edgy, and almost claustrophobic mood. England is on the brink of war; Briony, a budding writer, is on the edge of adolescence; her newly graduated sister Cecilia is thinking of her future life; and Robbie is about to start medical school. The summer is unusually hot. Troubled young cousins have arrived because their parents are on the verge of divorce; Briony's mother is suffering from migraines; her father is \\"away,\\" working for the government; her adored brother Leon and a friend have arrived from Cambridge; and Briony, an \\"almost only child,\\" with a hypersensitive imagination, finds her world threatened.<br /><br />Step by step, McEwan leads his characters to disaster, each individual action and misstep simple, explainable, and logical. The engaged reader sees numerous dramatic ironies and waits for everything to snap. When Briony finally commits her long-foreshadowed \\"crime,\\" the results are cataclysmic, and the world, as they know it, ends for several characters.<br /><br />Giving depth to his themes of truth, justice, honesty, guilt and innocence, and punishment and atonement, McEwan uses shifting points of view and an extended time frame. Part I is Briony's. In Part II, five years after the crime, Robbie, now a footsoldier retreating from the French countryside to Dunkirk, continues the same themes, seeing the crimes of war, not only between the combatants but against civilians and, at Dunkirk, by the Brits against each other. In Part III, Briony, atoning for her earlier crime by working as a student nurse, rather than studying to be a writer, brings the past and present together, tending the casualties of war. The ending takes place in 1999, at her 77th birthday party.<br /><br />This is a totally absorbing, fully developed novel, the kind one always yearns for and so rarely finds. The characters, the atmosphere, the lush descriptions, the sensitively treated themes, the intriguing and unusual plot, and the rare entr&eacute;e into the mind of a writer, both Briony and McEwan, give this novel a fascination few others achieve.

B00005M91K|2.0|After all the rave reviews, I decided I should give this film a try. Having now seen it, I guess I missed the \\"blessing\\" to which the film's title refers. Yes, the photography is gorgeous, and many of the scenes are esoteric and intriguing. However, the film's pace is glacial, some of the scenes go on way too long (especially the speeded-up urban traffic sequences), many of the scenes make little or no sense without at least some explanation, and I was unable to discern any sense of logic or connection in the sequencing of many of the scenes. When it ended, I was left feeling \\"Is that all there is?\\" An interesting experiment, but for me, one that doesn't deliver a satisfactory result.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Wow. Twenty-two tracks of complete bull s#!t.  I can't beleive anyone would buy this. I unfotunately had to suffer for three hours and listen to this crap in the guidence office at school today.  THIS IS NOT RAP. This is a complete mockery of the word hip-hop. Bragging has always been a part of rap, i guess, and if your gonna make club songs, then you shouldn't run around trying to be an emcee. I meen come on, he compares himself to NAS and BIG!!! WTF!!! He even goes as far as dissing NAS!!! (Make sure you check out \\"Dont Body Yourself\\". Nas DESTROYS 50 and Mobb Deep.)    If you like the G-Unit, you'll be happy to hear that he shouts G-G-G-G-G-Unit!!!! like five times on every song. Come on. \\"Candy Shop\\" sounds like \\"Magic stick\\", and \\"Magic Stick\\" sounds like \\"Disco Inferno\\", \\"Disco Inferno\\" sounds like \\"A Little Bit\\" or whatever its called, and I could probably keep on doing this until the point that every Dre produced G-Unit track (which is just about all of them) sound alike.    I really have no bussiness reviewing this CD, as I don't listen to this type of music, but after today I had to do it. The people need to understand that 50 sucks.      Im gonna be optimistic and say real Hip Hop is on its way for 2006. With people like Kanye West and Common taking over the mainstream, and the continuous popularity growth of the Hip-Hop underground, we'll see if 50's bubblegum pop rap can stand the tests of time.  If you want a large album, get Nas' \\"Street's Disciple\\". It has much more originality and creativity, and alot less name calling.

B0000DENUL|5.0|\\"Songs From the Big Chair\\" was the first CD I ever bought, which I did about four months before I actually had a CD player (stockpiling for new technology is a dominant gene). But this was one of the first really hot CDs and it was where I got my infamous \\"three song rule.\\" This rule states: If you are interested in an album by a new group all you need to justify the purchase is for the album to have three solid songs you would like to have. This one offered up \\"Shout,\\" \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" and \\"Head Over Heels.\\" The first two made it to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and last one topped off at #3. Of course the album went to the top of the charts as well, but more importantly there are other interesting tracks on the album besides the big three. \\"Heads Over Heels\\" is actually part of a suite with \\"Broken,\\" and both \\"The Working Hour\\" and \\"Listen\\" are above average.<br /><br />This edition offers up extended mixes of \\"Shout\\" and \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" as bonus tracks, but they are hardly necessary to justify having this album in your music collection. I still listen to \\"Songs From the Big Chair\\" about once a month and there is always a touch of regret that Tears for Fears self-destructed. The group produced a rather unique blend of synth-pop that made it stand out from most of what was going on in 1985 and the lyrics would have made for nice essay questions on a psychoanalysis exam:<br /><br />They gave you life<br /><br />And in return you gave them hell<br /><br />As cold as ice<br /><br />I hope we live to tell the tale<br /><br />Who would have thought that Arthur Janov's primal scream theory would result in deep lyrics? But then the group's name comes from that same source and the whole idea was much more in evidence on their debut album \\"Hurting\\" (\\"Mad World\\" from that album is reworked to great effect by Michael Andrews and Gary Jules at the end of the cult film \\"Donnie Darko,\\" which also used \\"Head Over Heels\\" to make Tears for Fears the official group of the film). Such ideas are still in evidence on this album, but if \\"Hurting\\" is about emotional pain then \\"Songs From the Big Chair\\" is moving on to the healing process. This is not exactly a concept album, but the songs do fit together in a way that suggests a definite sense of direction. But then when they start singing about four leaf clovers and do a techno-rap song like \\"Mother's Talk\\" you are just going to lose people who are going to go back to the melodies and not bother to figure out the words and dive for deeper meanings.<br /><br />Looking at the writing credits on these songs you would have said Tears for Fears was clearly Roland Orzabal's group, but by the time Curt Smith bolted they had produced only one more album in three years which had one decent song on it. So Tears of Fears does not exactly come under the heading of a One Hit Wonder, but they certainly only had the solid really great album. However, unlike other groups you might point to in similar circumstances from this same time period (e.g., A-Ha, Mr. Mister), this was the group I really thought had the musical talent to build on.

B0009OANHM|4.0|Ryan Adams is an overblown egomaniac. Ryan Adams is an underrated musical genius. Most listeners of his music fall into those camps, and the debate lives on. But one thing cannot be denied: Adams is a very good musician, and his brand of whiskey-soaked alt-country is in good form in \\"Cold Roses.\\"<br /><br />The two-disc album not terribly new territory, with echoes of \\"Heartbreaker,\\" albeit more subdued. And as the first of three scheduled albums this year, with his new band the Cardinals, hopefully \\"Cold Roses\\" representative of what Adams is going to stick to in future. It's certainly what he's good at.<br /><br />The songs here tend towards bluesy, midtempo rock, with countryish guitars and solid drums. The Cardinals are definitely a band that suit Adams' style, and they have a comfortable feel, as if they have been playing with him a long time. Songs like the gritty country song \\"Cherry Lane\\" are among the highlights of the album. There are also some slower, softer numbers like the poignant \\"How Do You Keep Love Alive,\\" which balance out the more robust songs, and show the softer side of Adams' music.<br /><br />Like many other two-disc albums, \\"Cold Roses\\" does suffer a little from double-disc syndrome, wherein some of the songs feel like they were put in to flesh out the tracklist. Fortunately, this is restricted to only a couple of songs. The majority of songs are strong and solidly written, with a well-worn sound like that of a comfortable slipper.<br /><br />After a few years of experimentation -- through the deeply forgettable \\"Rock'N'Roll\\" and the lovely acoustic \\"Love is Hell\\" -- now Adams is back at his roots. The Cardinals are guitarists J.P. Bowersock, Cindy Cashdollar, bassist Catherine Popper, and drummer Brad Pemberton. They all do marvelously, especially since they are an experienced band, with prior work with people like Heather Nova, Hem, and past work with Adams himself.<br /><br />Adams's voice is scratchier than in his past albums, but except for a few strained vocal moments, he sounds a bit world-weary but pleasant. He also gets joined by singer-songwriter/pianist Rachael Yamagata on three songs on the second disc, playing her instrument and lending her pretty voice to Adams' older, rougher one.<br /><br />Bluesy country-rock is where Ryan Adams belongs, and he does well with his new band the Cardinals.

0060855924|3.0|Terry Pratchett is now a publishing superstar, thanks to his witty, wonky Discworld series. But the Discworld series didn't start off on such good ground. In first Discworld novel \\"The Colour of Magic,\\" Pratchett lets his plot get away from him and meander over the edge of the Disc.<br /><br /> Discworld is a flat planet, balanced atop four elephants that stand on a giant turtle's back. And somewhere on that vast Disc is Rincewind the wizard -- cowardly, greedy, unlucky, a dropout and not very good at what he does. Enter Twoflower, a rather clueless tourist, and the Luggage, which walks around on hundreds of tiny legs.<br /><br /> Despite the fact that he doesn't want to, Rincewind is required to help the Discworld's first tourist ever (it's Twoflower, in case you're wondering). They're attacked by thieves, gamble with gods, encounter Death (who speaks ALL IN CAPITALS), and bumble through magical spells that can cause some major problems. But that isn't the biggest problem, when they encounter the very edge of the Disc...<br /><br /> \\"Colour of Magic\\" doesn't have much of a plot -- it basically has a long string of confusing, unhappy incidents that plague Rincewind, and it ends on an unsatisfying note. But at least the ride is fairly fun -- Pratchett spoofs the fantasy cliches with wink-nudge fervor.<br /><br /> Pratchett peppers his satirical little novel with lots of fun ideas, such as the quirky gods of Discworld and the dragon that vanishes if you stop believing in it. Unfortunately, the dialogue and writing aren't quite up to par. At times it's the delicious tone of British comedy, and sometimes it's so serious that it seems like Pratchett is writing an entirely different novel. Moreover, the plot meanders all over the place, as if he were making it up as he went.<br /><br /> Rincewind isn't a very engaging character in this volume -- we laugh at him, not with him. His constant efforts to keep himself alive are especially funny, since his luck is a mixture of bad (he always gets into trouble) and good (he always gets out of it). Twoflower is an amusing character, but the Luggage steals the show despite not being able to speak.<br /><br /> Fans of comic fantasy might enjoy \\"Colour of Magic,\\" but it's by far the weakest of Pratchett's many Discworld books. It was only in the succeeding books that Pratchett found his footing on the flat planet.ally funny, since his luck is a mixture of bad (he always gets into trouble) and good (he always gets out of it).

B000063JDE|5.0|David Lynch's \\"BLUE VELVET\\" is a brilliant display of artistic story telling & film makeing! A perfect example of the director forceing the viewer to take part in the movie by filling in the missing puzzle piece's with his or her own imagination. David Lynch is so far above the rest its ridiculous!

031286504X|4.0|First off, I have to say I agree, to a certain extent, with the reviewer who gave this book only two stars.  He raises some interesting points, some of which do indeed present valid issues regarding the content.  That said, I must next admit to being a R. Matheson fan of the highest degree.  He has a way with time and place that melds together even inconclusive facts in a way that becomes totally believable, even irrevant to the whole story.  Let's face it, the man makes time travel a romance and horror a comment on society.  I adore his work, all of it, this book is no exception.  I found the short stories following IAL to be just as entertaining, perhaps even more so... I do love well written horror!  It is amazing, and emmense praise that so many horror movies have been generated from Matheson's I Am Legend.  I just saw 28 Days Later over the weekend... a movie which doesn't apologize for it's resemblence... any \\"zombie\\" and/or vampire movie from the past four decades tips it's hat to Matheson... and it's this type of response that speaks loudest for this story.  Immitation is the highest form of praise and for Matheson, rightly so.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|Who ever says that happy endings are just for fairy tales has not seen this movie. It could fit any profile out there. Giving anyone a sense of hope for the near future. Thank You Bridget Jones for making me think that happy endings can come true outside of fairy tales!!! <br /> <br />
0060763280|3.0|This book has been a clear read with some good ideas and productive perspectives.  A great tool for new direction and focus in financial thinking.  I really enjoyed it and recommend it for those who need a real change in their financial habits.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This band makes some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard, and until this album, it would all fit perfectly in place at a funeral.  With this album, though, they have done something different.  All hints of a funereal dirge are taken out and  replaced with melodies and lyrics that are transcendent and uplifting.  Strings are more present on this album than on the others, and that is a very welcome addition.  More than anything it's good to hear they haven't reached a point of stagnation, yet.<br /><br />\\"Sægl&oacute;pur\\" is arguably the most beautiful song ever written by the band, there is no drone, no sad strums or string plucks, it starts off with an otherworldly piano melody and tinkering bells under it, and Jonsi's crooning vocals, and at the 2-minute mark there is a musical explosion unlike any the band has ever produced before.  I have goosebumps just thinking about it.  If you, the reader, are going to sample anything, check out this tune.  This is what the band, the music, is all about.  This is how music should make a person feel, they nailed it.  It will make longtime fans happy, and easily win over the hearts of curious music fans due to its simplistic and catchy and ethereal melody.<br /><br />But all of the songs have this contained in them, as I explained before.  All of the slow drones and depressing-sounding tinkerings are gone and replaced with lovely music.  \\"S&eacute; Lest\\", at the end, even has an oom-pa-pa brass band!  Always changing and making fresh music for their fans... This band has so many beautiful ideas in their heads, I hope they keep finding lovely ways to portray them to their fans.<br /><br />_Takk..._ is a lovely artistic statement.  If _( )_ was music for a funeral, then _Takk..._ must be what it's like when one reaches heaven.
B000AL730O|1.0|If you're under 60, stay clear of this sleeping pill disguised as an album.  Absolutely nothing here is worth listening to.  Some of it is almost painful.  \\"The  King of Bland\\" delivers some of his worst lyrics yet- and some of the most yawning tunes you'll ever hear.  Someone gave it to me as a present and I'm now wondering if they even like me considering how awful it is, but they knew I am a Beatle fan. <br /> <br />\\"Fine Line\\" starts off on an unremarkable note- \\"How Kind of you\\"- ugh!  Paul drones on and on these same phrases, he is singing terrible, and it's just so bad.  \\"Jenny Wren\\" is decent if you apply a curve, but it's nothing great.  \\"a Certain Softness\\" is like some Latin number, but it is just soooo wimpy and unimpressive.  Paul delivers on the \\"Granny\\" music in this one- \\"Follow Me\\" is one of those ballads he writes that you feel embarrassed about, that and \\"This Never Happened Before\\"- you wonder how a guy who was in the Beatles could be churning out this crap.  It's like 10 year old is writing some of this trash.  Paul is trying to be introspective, I guess, but it only goes to prove he's not capable of it- all his ideas are cliche's and shallow formulas looking for a hook.  This guy is no John Lennon, he needs to stick to rockers and story songs- he has no depth and he doesn't have the talent anymore to pull off anything requiring it.  I'm actually ashamed for him- maybe it was time for him to retire at least the songwriting years ago- he still puts out great concerts and I would tell everyone to go to those- but the guy is long long long past being able to write anything any good anymore.  Stick to the old songs- don't ruin your reputation with this new garbage.
B000002AZ8|4.0|This album, the third in Pearl Jam's great catalog, has a certain feel to it that's summed up so well with the CD case. The content of this album seem to play around with the word 'vitality'. Throughout the cleverly designed booklet you have many instances be it articles, mini-stories, or pictures that have central theme of the power to survive or the energy to live and what not. Pearl Jam gets bonus points here for really setting the mood for the album as you flip through the book and listen. Now on to the music.<br /><br />The first song, Last Exit, is beautiful rocking song with a solid little solo. Spin The Black Circle is one of the hardest songs on the album and it's classic Pearl Jam. It's a song about getting record and spinning it letting yourself be taken away. I'm sure many of us who love music get feeling like those in the song. The third song, Not For You, has a great beat to it and keeps up with the rock song. Tremor Christ is a solid song but certainly not one of my favorites.<br /><br />Next comes a beautiful slow song, Nothingman, which I feel is related to the best song on this CD, Better Man (11th track). Both have their lyrics written on the same yellow notebook paper(though that's not quite solid evidence) and have the same type of subject matter.  These two songs are the real jems of this disc and are the main reasons I keep coming back to this album.<br /><br />Nothingman is followed by Whipping which is a song about as hard as Spin The Black Circle.  Now comes the part of the album that gives this 4 stars. I tend to skip 'Pry, To', 'Bugs', 'Satan's Bed', 'Aye Davanita' depending on my mood. These songs are rather unique and some people love them. In between those songs are Corduroy and the aforementioned Better Man. Corduroy is great and has some sweet guitar work at the end. The last good song is track 12, Immortality. Some people have said it's a tribute to Kurt Cobain but I don't think it was written after that happened. It might hold more meaning now though as it's a beautifully written song. The last one is one of those weird songs that I've listened to only once. It's a rather creepy track and probably shouldn't be called a song.<br /><br />Despite all the songs I tend to skip this album is still great compared to other stuff out there today. I like this PJ album the least but because of the songs I do like being so great it earns high honors. This one shouldn't be missed from PJ fans.ld more meaning now though as it's a beautifully written song. The last one is one of those weird songs that I've listened to only once.

B000AL730O|4.0|It's great to see Paul still taking chances at age 63 with this album.  Although I am a HUGE McCartney fan I absolutely hate Driving Rain so I feel that I can be critical of him when necessary.  This album has a much different feel to it than any of his previous releases, undoubtedly due to some extent his choice of producer.  I agree with most reviewers that one or two more rockers would have helped balance this out and prevent some of the songs from sounding alike.  Paul's voice also sounds weak on a few tracks, most notable Jenny Wren.  But there are some great tracks on here as well.  \\"Fine Line,\\" \\"Too Much Rain,\\" \\"English Tea,\\" and \\"Anyway\\" could have easily been Beatle tracks and would have fit perfectly on the White Album.  I can definitely understand Paul's statement that Friends to Go was inspired by George Harrison...it sounds so much like a song he would have written.  \\"Promise to You Girl\\" sounds a lot to me like \\"Keep Under Cover\\" off of Paul's underated album Pipes of Peace (well, at least the first side of that album is underated)  Overall, this a great album by Paul on par with Flowers in the Dirt, Flaming Pie, and McCartney, which, although I stand by my statement that this album differs from all of his previous releases, I would say are the closest comparisons.  Any music created by McCartney is a gift to the world and this album is no different.  Get it!!  You won't regret it.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|Sigur R&oacute;s's Takk is a conglomerative masterpiece, instilling their position, in my opinion, as a truly exceptional group that can release very good music album after album. Takk sounds...different from ( ) and Agaetis Byrjun, but it is still identifiably Sigur R&oacute;s; it has elements of both of their previous albums, with the soundscapes of ( ) and the melodies of A.B. The album utilizes more strings, and it is certainly happier in mood, and relatively more upbeat. There are points in the album where they remind me a bit of Mum, with their use of piano and/or chimes, and more importantly, there are times in the album where I thought, \\"wow, that's new\\" and this is a very good thing. I can't stress enough how good this album is, like they took all of their talent and used it toward Takk. The moments such as in my personal favorite of A.B., Flugufrelsarinn, are there, and create another truly ethereal experience that only Sigur R&oacute;s can evoke.
B00005LC1H|5.0|One wonders if they had this type of comedy for the US of A, would we be a bit more literate?  The group that put Fawlty Towers together were classic writers of the Classic Brits view of \\"funny\\".  John Cleese does his slow takes so well, while his wife, Prunella Scales is the epitomy of Matriarchal!  Connie Booth as a co-writer and support for \\"Mr.Fawlty\\", excels herself as a comedienne and talent.  And of course there is Manuel, from Barcelona, who often times has the job of taking the blame for all of \\"fawlty's\\" faults.  My jacket on my DVD calls it the Sistine Chapel of sitcoms.  I buy that!!
B00005Y7KX|4.0|I have to say I was pretty pleased with this DVD. The music is one of the best. Very rare for boring songs to appear...but i felt that sometimes the story would waver a bit for some reason. <br /> <br />Also, i am kind of disappointed about Helene Segara as Esmeralda. <br />She has a nice voice, good for pop, but for broadway, you need something more. Julie Zenatti whom played Fleur-dy-lys was on the other hand, did a dramatic and wonderful job. She had the overpowering prescence that you always want in a broadway. <br /> <br />I was just let down about Esmeralda though, but truth be told, I've never really liked any of the Esmeraldas' out of all the versions I've listened too. I didn't even like Noa that much, nor Tina Arena. <br /> <br />Anyway, enough about Esmeralda. The rest of the cast were wonderful, especially Gringoire and, (gasp) Phoebus, for all his manipulativeness.  <br /> <br />I especially like Phoebus for his voice.It carried greatly, and his looks............................. <br /> <br />I would also like to say that the price is very high for this DVD no matter how good it is. You should consider renting it before you take action on buying it at all. <br /> <br />Peace, and I hope this helped.
B00005JNQS|3.0|\\"As a child, after watching this movie I would think that big business must be evil and want to control the world\\" wrote a reviewer in this page.  Well, you don't need this film to tell you that, isn't?<br /><br />\\"Robots\\" is an allegory to the imagined USA that existed in the fifties of the 20th Century (and against superficial commercialism and fashion).  Suposedly, corporations were good then and their interest was to make our lives better.  Fifty years passed by, and still Hollywood want us to believe that this is the bussiness entour we must protect (and I am not even sure that this kind of enterprise existed once).  Schumpeter's animal spirits had been replaced long ago by the pure capitalist drive which is to maximize profits (who doesn't know this?).<br /><br />The animation is really nice and the pop references find a place between the populist Dreamworks jokes and the intelligent Pixar homages: we get Britney Spears (-), but also a robot version of \\"Singin' in the rain\\" (+).  Some sequences are very kinetic and sorprendent: the local mode of transport (not very efficient, btw) and the dominoes wave.  Is a nice rent (or a buy for a child), but don't expect more than that.  For your children, you could do worst than this.<br /><br />(Is really disturbing that in a fantasy environment the animators need to reproduce American capitalism: why the robots need to work? why they have kids? why they need a corporation? etc.  Is not clear).
B00005Y7AW|5.0|rufus isnt for everyone, but then again who is? i highly recomend this album, five stars.

0930289528|5.0|Alan Moore really comes into his own in this graphic novel.  This scenario of the future, although perhaps far fetched to us today, was a very real scenario in the '80s, when the U.S. and the Soviets were at each other's throats.  The way \\"V\\" speaks in classic literature is a nice touch.  With the movie coming out next March, make sure you read this graphic novel before you see it.  All in all, V for Vendetta is hard, gritty, light, and excellent.  Don't miss this.
B00005ATQ9|3.0|Overly long (184 min.) costume piece based on Thackery's novel of the same name. Ryan O'Neal is the lead character who lets success go to his head. The settings are exquisite and faultless, but the slow-paced acting and director Kubrick's desire to keep just about everything from the book in the movie causes the film to become overindulgent, and we lose interest. Thackery's lively wit is totally absent here - a shame.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Best album I've ever heard.  Of any genre.  Ever.  Buy It.
B000062YB1|3.0|That one word says it all. This actually deserves 3 and a half stars, but Amazon don't make them available so it'll just have to go with a humble 3. <br />When listening to Slayer, one always felt that they were just normal guys who happened to be very good at writing music. \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\" sounds quite cocky at times, as if they were beginning to distance themselves from their common fans and humble beginnings and reaching up to the echelons of metal gods. The production on this album sounds almost (horror of horrors!) commercial at times. But this isn't necessarily a good thing, as the guitars in particular lack punch, sounding a bit weak and flaccid. But the main problem with the album is its abundance of uninspired, throwaway filler material. <br />Here's a breakdown of all the tracks: <br /> <br />War Ensemble 9/10: Classic, premium Slayer, no doubt about that, and one of the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />Blood Red 6/10: Bit of a filler this one, just doesn't excite the way a Slayer song should. <br /> <br />Spirit In Black 8/10: Actually very good, with great lyrics and a powerful chorus. <br /> <br />Expendable Youth 5/10: Another filler, it's just tedious and forgettable. <br /> <br />Dead Skin Mask 9/10: Fantastic, one of the few songs on the album where the band sound like they're really making an effort. Effortlessly fluid and impossibly creepy, and containing a bunch of great ideas all morbidly executed, it's my personal favourite from \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\". <br /> <br />Hallowed Point 7/10: Savage, with a pace harking back to the \\"Reign In Blood\\" days. However, unlike \\"Angel Of Death\\" for example, it's fast and brutal in a slightly uninteresting way - that said however, it's definately one of the album's high points. <br /> <br />Skeletons Of Society 7/10: Adrenalin junkies are going to be very disappointed here, as it's probably the slowest song the band have ever written, but it does contain a somewhat hypnotizing quality in its chugginess. <br /> <br />Temptation 5/10: Mediocre filler at best. <br /> <br />Born Of Fire 6/10: A bit better, but no classic. <br /> <br />Seasons In The Abyss 7/10: Quite good, starts very promisingly, but seems to taper off suddenly and prematurely. <br /> <br />All in all, it's not an album I'd advise you to sprint out the door to buy - essential for the die-hards, I suppose, but not an album I'd really recommend to the casual fan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNTX|5.0|This will no doubt be one of those films that you will play over and over and will be talked about for years to come.With the bulk of the film in black and white,bits of colour are  thrown in and really intensify a scene.I'm sure we will now seen more films done in this way. <br />
B0000CABBW|5.0|Now im a 6\\"4 230 pound man and usually would find these sorta movies a bore but like you've probably read by now from other reviewers, this movie had me blubbering like a little girl.  <br /> <br />I have met many maori people and their some of the most geniune, sincere and proudest people I've ever come across. They are fiercely traditional as you'll find out in the movie which is so true too life. <br /> <br />All I can say is Ka Pai! (Well done)
B000AYQNYI|5.0|Now this is how a DualDisc is done!!!  Mercury Records has done a wonderful job with this classic 1986 album. Not only do we get a new August 2005 stereo remaster by George Marino at Sterling Sound, New York, but we also get an excellent 5.1 surround sound mix by Jeff Fura-- which restores some tracks to longer mixes, including \\"Livin' On A Prayer\\" and \\"Raise Your Hands\\".  The real treat here is the new surround sound mix of \\"Never Say Goodbye\\", complete with a new introduction!  It sounds awesome!  The album has never sounded better!<br /><br />If that wasn't enough, Mercury have generously included the 5 music videos pulled from the album:  You Give Love A Bad Name, Livin' On A Prayer, Wanted Dead Or Alive, Never Say Goodbye, and Wild In The Streets -- all directed by Wayne Isham.<br /><br />The package also includes lyrics, a biography, and photos.  The surround sound mix is available on both DVD-Audio players and standard DVD players.<br /><br />Hopefully we will see DualDisc versions of more Bon Jovi albums to follow shortly.
0743454537|5.0|This book was selected for our neighborhood Book Club. I am not going to go into details about the plot of this book. I did not nitpit minor errors in the book, mainly because I read the book as a \\"novel.\\" The premise got my attention - Anna was genetically engineered to be a donor match for her sister. When she is slated to be a kidney donor, she refuses and hires a lawyer to become medically emancipated. I really liked reading the story from the various viewpoints of the book characters. I fell for Anna (what a spunky, courageous, vulnerable child - but such a believably-written character). Our book club had very opinionated, heated discussions about Sara, Anna and ALL the characters. The relationship between Anna and her attorney was also well-written and interesting. A minor quibble: I liked Julia (the court-appointed guardian), but the addition of her sister was a little bit of a stretch and did not seem to add anything to the story, at least for me. At the end of the book the author discusses the reasoning for that character. <br /> <br />SPOILER ALERT: The ending TOTALLY took me by surprise. When it talked about the accident, my mind immediately went to Jesse. I did not see this coming at all. Out of the 12 members of our book club, two of them DID expect this ending. It made for a sad, shocking ending. Warning: Do not read the last few chapters at work unless you want to explain red eyes. I do like some realism in my movies and books and realize that not all books will have a happy endings BUT, I really wanted Anna to live.  <br /> <br />The final part of the book was also well done. Hearing Kate's viewpoint of life without Anna and how it affected her family really help to tie up and bring closure to what happened.
B00082IJ08|3.0|This album is not what I expected from gorillaz (a kickass band). The first album is way better, I love there music because it's a mix of differ genre, but this last album they lost that....the only song in Demon Days that I like was Feel Good Inc. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong I like gorillaz but they lost the way the do music...   <br /> <br /> <br />
B000003TAR|4.0|Maybe its both. Whatever your views on Nirvana you've got to admire the grim grit and determined anti commercialism of 'In Utero', its as if after changing the world with their last album Nirvana wanted to take that change even further towards the realms of finishing off over produced stadium rock. A shame they didn't succeed really, but still its a worthy attempt.  <br /> <br />Partly a reaction towards the commericaly hysteria that surrounded Nirvana, 'In Utero' creaks, groans, squeals and howls where its predecessor inserted pop hooks and relatively sing along choruses. Though it touches on much the same terriority as 'Nevermind' its does so with more coherence and depth as well as a far greater sense of bitterness and cynicism. Demons are exorcised here and though not laid to rest. Its a pretty damn unrelentingly harrowing listen and you certaintly won't come away smiling once you give it a spin. That said if you expected that from a Nirvana album you've seriously misjudged the band. Though  theres some filler here which does take away from the records overall greatness (imagine if it had been ever shorter and sharper) its still a pretty great album, Nirvana's best studio album infact. Enjoy, well maybe just appreciated.
B000A0GP0Y|1.0|I have to say I like Adam Sandler in some of his movies (50 first dates and Wedding Singer) and then the bad ones ( Mr.Deeds,Spanglish and more). This film is a poor effort to get good jokes, big satrs in a bad movie. The jokes are all old and used already, the acting sucked Burt Reynolds has no life and shows off like he dose in all his moives, Chris Rock is anyoing like he is in all his movies and James Cromwell tries to be the meanest guy in the world and it's funny becouse he's not. The story is predictable and pointless. Overall it was a big waste of time watching the longest yard.
B000006NPY|5.0|Taking its lead from the gentler, less guitar orientated tracks from 'Mellon Collie & The Infitie Sadness' the Smashing Pumpkins fourth album 'Adore' is a sad and nostalgic change of pace. Its hard to say whether the lack of Jimmy Chamberlin, the lack of whose heroic drumming is the most glaring difference on this record, dictated the change of pace or whether Billy Corgan would have headed in this direction anyway. However that a moot point.  <br /> <br />This is a darker but more contemplative Smashing Pumpkins. More interested in subtle arrangements and delicate melodies that the driving angst ridden guitars that came before. While some would argue against it, 'Adore' is in many ways a gothic record, in the sense of what that term used to mean before the likes of Marylin Manson. It embraces that tragic romantic atmosphere of the likes of early Cure or Dead Can Dance. Synths bubble underneath the surface, slightly menacing yet never drowning the songs, and faux poetic lyrics. Moody and self absorbed, this is a withdrawn Billy Corgan whoses far from the angsty teenager he once was, and he finally realises that too because its also a more mature effort and shows that he seriously wants to expand his boundaries even if that takes him away from the commcerial peak of his last record. We should be so lucky if Billy ever produces an entire album of this quality again.
B000002UDG|4.0|For his post-Beatles career, Paul McCartney's work is basically intertwined between work that is credited what is considered \\"Paul McCartney Solo Work\\" and his work with Wings.   When McCartney left the Beatles, he would release two solo albums \\"McCartney\\" and \\"Ram\\".   While \\"Ram\\" would produce the classic song \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\", \\"Ram\\" would be trashed by the critics.   It was at that point that McCartney formed the band Wings.  Wings would basically be a \\"project\\" type of band by McCartney that would consist of himself, his wife Linda McCartney, vocalist Denny Laine, and a revolving door of studio musicians.   Wings would eventually be dissolved in 1980 (and Laine would depart), and McCartney would return to recording under his own name (with wife Linda by his side).   Despite the decade of recording under the \\"Wings\\" umbrella, no mistake would be made - Paul McCartney would still be in control and it would very much be his music.     Therefore, Paul McCartney's 1987 greatest hits release \\"All the Best\\" basically is a snapshot of his post-Beatles career throughout 1984.     This collection does a good job at providing this snapshot, however there are some omissions that hurt this collection. <br /> <br />I once heard an interview with Paul McCartney and he was asked basically what is the best song he ever wrote.   I remember McCartney mulling the question and finally the song \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" came from his mouth.  With all of the amazing work he has done throughout his career - including creating some of the most legendary songs with the Beatles, many might be surprised by this answer.   However after thinking about it, I think one can make the argument that this song is in the upper echelon of his musical portfolio.    Yet, when I look at the listing of tracks on this collection, \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is no where to be found.   I think this song has a major importance from McCartney's career because it was on that first post Beatles album - 1970's \\"McCartney\\".   The bottom line is that I am completely shocked that this collection doesn't include this song.  To a lesser extent, I am pretty disappointed that \\"Take it Away\\" is not included as well. <br /> <br />One positive thing about \\"All the Best\\" is that it includes several songs that were originally only released as singles.  These songs include the popular theme song \\"Live and Let Die\\" (from the James Bond film),  \\"Another Day\\", \\"Goodnight Tonight\\", \\"C Moon\\", and \\"Junior's Farm\\".   <br /> <br />When looking at this collection, there are really two other Paul McCartney compilations to consider.  Like \\"All the Best\\", these compilations basically include mixes of his work recorded under the Paul McCartney name and those recorded under the Wings umbrella  (Note: These compilations are actually released under the \\"Wings\\" umbrella).   The first of these is 1978's \\"Wings Greatest\\".   This is a more dated collection (obviously including material only until 1978).  All of the songs that are on \\"Wings Greatest\\" are included on \\"All the Best\\" with the exception of \\"Hi Hi Hi\\" and \\"Mull of Kintyre\\".  Like \\"All the Best\\", this collection omits one of the most legendary McCartney songs - \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\".  \\"Wings Greatest\\" also doesn't contain 1975's \\"Listen to What the Man Said\\" that is included on \\"All the Best\\".   <br /> <br />In 2001, a more comprehensive collection was released under the Wings umbrella that included both Wings and Paul McCartney \\"solo\\" material.  This collection entitled \\"Wingspan: Hits and History\\" is two disc set. This collection contains all of the material on \\"All the Best\\" with the exception of two popular duets that McCartney recorded in the 1980s:  \\"Ebony and Ivory\\" with Stevie Wonder and \\"Say Say Say\\" with Michael Jackson. (It is worth noting that McCartney recorded another duet with Michael Jackson - \\"The Girl is Mine\\", but this was released on Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" album and is not included on any McCartney compilation.)   This collection doesn't miss the mark - it does include \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\".  It also includes the five songs listed above that were only released as singles. <br /> <br />As for \\"All the Best\\", it is also worth noting that there were actually two versions released, a U.S. version and a U.K. version.   The songs exclusive to U.K. version are \\"Pipes of Peace\\", \\"Once Upon a Long Ago\\", \\"We All Stand Together\\" and \\"Mull of Kintyre\\" while the U.S. version contains \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\", \\"Goodnight Tonight\\", \\"With a Little Luck\\", and \\"Junior's Farm\\".   There is a slight reordering of the tracks between the U.S. and U.K. versions. <br /> <br />When looking at a greatest hits collection, I normally prefer the tracks to be arranged in chronological order in which they were either released and/or recorded.   This allows me to see how the artist has progressed over a period of time.   One thing that also disappoints here is that the tracks are in a shuffled order.   I really think this is a drawback - especially in the case of Paul McCartney where I find it interesting to track his post-Beatles career. <br /> <br />One thing that I found very positive were the liner notes.   One thing that I found entertaining each of the songs on this collection is represented with a graphic illustration.   Although these illustrations don't contribute anything to the musical experience, I still found this entertaining.   One thing that is unusual about the liner notes is that they include the lyrics to all of the songs.   The downside is that the corresponding albums (or denotations for songs that were listed only as singles) are not listed each song that is included in the collection.  I also would have liked to have seen musician credits listed - particularly for the Wings songs. <br /> <br />Despite some of these shortcomings that are listed above, the bottom line is that this collection still contains enough good content to be a collection worth considering.  This is a good collection, but some McCartney fans still may want to look to the \\"Wingspan\\" collection to get a more comprehensive collection.
B000003TA4|4.0|I hardly think I can really add anything new to discussion on 'Nevermind' so i'll just keep this short. If you forget the fact that this album spearheaded that massive change in pop culture by bringing grunge to the mainstream and all the subsequent effects of that what you're left with is merely a decent album. Its easy to see why Kurt Cobain came to loathe 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' its hardly his most inventive song lyrically or musically (most people know by know, and Cobain admitted that its tune its basically copped from the Pixies 'Gouge Away'). The classic riff from 'Come As You Are' is an even more blatant steal from Killing Joke's 'Eighties' and that only really leaves some good song and some average ones.  <br /> <br />Sure its anthemic, and wrought with emotion and anguish that you can really indentify with when you're a teenager and even a bit older. But thats not enough on its own really.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|This is missing alot of songs such as Mr.Brownstone,It's So Easy,My Michelle,Get in the Ring,So Fine,Enstranged,and Hair of the Dog.It's kind of sad how pathetic this greatest hits album is.The band doesn't deserve this and neither do their fans.You are better of getting all of their original albums and passing this up completely!! This is only for the most casual fans so if you are a true fan of Guns N' Roses stay away, stay far away!!!
B000000WJZ|5.0|Armed with sabathesque cruching guitars, a deep rumbling bass, thumping drums and of corse Billy Corgans rasping vocals, 'Siamese Dream' is perhaps the Smashing Pumpkins most consistent and focused record. From the marching band drum roll that kicks off 'Cherub Rock' to the dreamy lullaby like 'Luna' the second offering from the Pumpkins paints a vision of growing up in the USA. Taking stabs at everything from being cool, romanticised relationships, depression and just plain old boredom, this is Corgan's statement about well everything in life almost.  <br /> <br />Lyrically 'Siamese Dream' is the most caustic, sarcastic, tongue in cheeck record that the band would ever offer. Though angsty, its a sneering, eye rolling angst on display, no wallowing self pity that would creep into to later songs. And the lyrics are matched by the inventive riffs and melodies which pervade the proceedings. A mixture of 80's post punk/indie intensity and of classic rocks heaviness and granduer, though hardly a revaltion in a world that was at the peak of the grunge surge, the Pumpkins definately deliver it in their own unique style.  <br /> <br />'Siamese Dream' is probably one of those records all teenages should own as they grow up. Perhaps you won't always see it as the greatest record ever made, but it will certaintly always be a brilliant album that speaks volumes about those difficult years everyone goes through.
B00000I07R|4.0|With the release of \\"Keep the Faith\\", Bon Jovi successfully made the change from an 80s glam/hair band to a great rock and roll band in the 90s. <br /> <br />This cd is loaded with great songs, including the title cut, \\"I Believe\\", and the very good \\"Dry County\\", an 8 minute song about the problems facing rural America. <br /> <br />For fans of ballads, there are two excellent ones on this cd; \\"Bed of Roses\\" and \\"I Want You\\".  Both feature Jon's tremendous vocals and Richie's great guitar work. <br /> <br />There is very little filler material on this cd.  Each song is very good in its own right.  From the upbeat \\"Sleep When I'm Dead\\" to \\"In These Arms\\", there is something for everyone on this cd.  I highly recommend this great disc.  Pop it in and hear some great rock and roll by the boys from New Jersey.
B000000WA4|5.0|'Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness' was the Smashing Pumpkins first major shift in style style since their first recordings. And by doing that in a double album they certaintly took their chances. It paid off as well. From the opening neo-classic strains of the title tracks the Pumpkins third offering MCATIS sets its self up as almost an operetta. Its a dramatic bold grab for the spot light, and Billy Corgan never holds back.  <br /> <br />Nothing is left out of the mix here. Grand bombast (Tonight, Tonight) speed fulled grunge (Jellybelly, Zero, Where Boys Fear To Tread ect) sweet and twisted but delicated lullabies (Thirty-Three, In The Arms Of Sleep, We Only Come Out At Night and more) as well as progressive rock stylings, heavy metal snarling beasts, post punk electro and just plain old rock make it on here. The only let downs about this record is that when you hear some of the outtakes from the era you realise that it probably could have been even better.  <br /> <br />While certaintly not for everyones tastes 'Mellon Collie & The Infitie Sadness' is a rewarding listen for anyone who doesn't care about the clash of styles and unrepentant gradiosity on display. The subtle songs balance out the over the top ones, tenderness and fury sit side by side, hope and dispair. Some songs sit out like priceless gems among the rough, but when you look closely even the rough is captivating and fitting. And you might as well enjoy it because albums like this only come along once in a life time.
B0001XAS1M|5.0|In 1977, songwriter Jim Steinmann and Meat Loaf combined to write what has become one of the most well-known and classic albums in history: \\"Bat Out of Hell\\".  Steinmann's flair for lyrics and an almost rock opera-like sound, combined with Meat Loaf's harmonic vocals make this a cd for the ages. <br /> <br />This cd is packed with songs that everyone can remember.  Who can forget the classic \\"I bet you say that to all the boys\\" line, or the blusey beginning to \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\"?  These songs, as well as the others on this cd, have stood the test of time, and have remained popular for almost 30 years. <br /> <br />Backed up by such great musicians as Ellen Foley (The female lead on \\"Paradise\\"), Todd Rundgren's guitars, Max Weinberg's drums, and Steinmann's own keyboards, Meat Loaf's vocals sound even better.  From the ballads \\"Two out of Three Ain't Bad\\" to \\"For Crying Out Loud\\", this great cd packs a punch that you won't forget. <br /> <br />I give this disc my highest recommendation.  Its easy to see why this cd has remained popular for so long; great vocals, great musicians, and a unique sound that everyone will remember.
B00000C3G6|5.0|Although the period from 1971-1977 saw CSNY struggle to come up with a proper studio followup to \\"Deja Vu\\" (sessions were begun and aborted in acrimony on three different occassions in 1973, 1974 and 1976, with the '76 effort very nearly seeing release), <br />the period did produce some fine solo efforts and collaborations by its various members.  Perhaps the best of these (bar some of Young's epochal work at this time like \\"On The Beach\\" and \\"Zuma\\") was the debut Crosby/Nash album from '72, which is so high in quality that it is actually the equal of the first few CSN/Y efforts and in spite of the absence of Stills, can almost be considered the third CSN studio effort.  Every track is extremely strong and their harmonies have never sounded better.   <br /> <br />For his part, Nash contributes some of the strongest, least fluffy material of his entire career; both \\"Southbound Train\\" and \\"Immigration Man\\" were instant singer-songwriter classics of the period, with Nash's usual melodic instincts but also a bit more edge than he usually dished out.  Crosby here completed the incredible winning streak that had begun as early as The Byrds' \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" album and had continued through the \\"Notorious Byrd Brothers\\", \\"Crosby Stills And Nash\\", \\"Deja Vu\\" and \\"If I Could Only Remember My Name\\" efforts; this would be the last time his vocals and songwriting prowess would sound as breathtaking.  \\"Whole Cloth\\", \\"Where Will I Be?\\" and \\"Page 43\\" all speak of a singular genius which would soon be wiped out by excessive drug use.  The album was a huge commercial success at the time (#4 US) and yielded a hit in \\"Immigration Man\\", which makes it all the more puzzling why it is only available as an import here.  But the bottom line is this is a now-overlooked effort not to be missed.

0060555661|5.0|The words: \\"the intelligent investor\\" is to investing what the words: \\"eat right and exercise\\" is to dieting.  It is not about trends or fads or gimmicks, it is about the basic truths underlying the market. <br /> <br />While this book covers the basics of investing, the book is still read cover to cover by many seasoned investing experts on an almost annual basis.  If you are even thinking about managing money (yours or anyone else's), you need this book. <br /> <br />To me the question is not whether you shold buy The Intelligent Investor, the question is which edition to buy.  Some have criticized the Zweig commentary (in the latest edition) as dilutive of the sage words of Ben Graham.  While this is a valid criticism, one of the criticisms of the original text is that it was written in another era and some of the text seems dated.  Zweig does an excellent job of making some of the chapters more relevant to today's audience by applying the underlying rationale in certain chapters to current issues. <br /> <br />There is nothing to keep you from ingoring the Zweig commentary the first time you read the book, but you would be doing yourself a disservice if you ignored it forever.
0156027321|3.0|The Life of Pi is a interesting story of a boy who must survive in the middle of the ocean after his family's tragic death in a boating accident. Unfortunately at the time of the accident they are moving their zoo buisness with them which eventually leads to Pi being on a boat with a tiger. He struggles to not be eaten and find land. This book reads like nonfiction and gives a realistic view of the brutality of survival.
0156027321|3.0|Sure, this quirky book kept me turning pages, and I might have felt better about its improbable story had it not been for two things.  The first was the claim that if one heard the story, it would make one believe in God (OK, so this is actually inserted in dialogue and told to the narrator of the story by another character; still, it builds expectations for some miraculous revelation).  Having finished the book and discovered that my views on God remained what they were before I started reading the book, I've got to assume that this line was one of those `you've got to grab them in the first few pages' lines so beloved of publishers (and Man Booker Prize judges?) these days. <br /> <br />The second thing that turned me off was the narrator's defense of zoos, the assertion that animals are happier in confinement than in the wild because all their needs are taken care of.  Having just come back from a zoo and seen all the bored, neurotic animals, either endlessly sleeping or frantically pacing their cages, I remembered this assertion and felt that it was a dangerous one, suggesting that any remorse we feel for evicting them from their natural habitats is misplaced as long as the animals have representation in a cage somewhere by a member of their species.  Since Martel's book is largely about animals, this exoneration of our locking up the stars of his book in cages seemed heartless and calculated. <br /> <br />If you're looking for reading material to see you through a long, boring flight, you might want to pick this book up.  If you're looking for insight into how man should interact with the other animals on this planet, I'd advise you to look elsewhere for your reading material. <br />
0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha is one of my favorite books. Its one of those books that you can reread a million times and each time you get a little more out of it. Simple story of Siddhartha's struggles through life to find himself and the ultimite truths of existance.

0440237688|5.0|The Giver tells the story of a boy named Jonas who lives in a world with no color, crime, free will, or individuality, a so called perfect society. Jonas is choosen to become the giver, who is a person who stores all past memories of life. Jonas is given memories of what life used to be, which is what it is today and discovers war, pain and death. A really really good book that deals with reality and the choices of being oblivious and happy vs. realistic and having to deal with the hardships of life.
B000002J09|4.0|Led Zeppelin IV begins with the classic, but overplayed \\"Black Dog,\\" and goes through 42 minutes of great classic rock ending with the 7 minute epic \\"When the Levee Breaks.\\" Many people have considered this to be Led Zeppelins greatest album (though I think that is Houses of the Holy). The thing about Led Zeppelin IV, is that you've probably heard half of these songs on the radio at least a hundred times. That takes away some of the appeal of this record. <br /> <br />1. Black Dog: This is a great song for an opener, very catchy beginning with a nice guitar riff. This is one of those songs though that the radio has gotten a hold of. The first few times that I heard it I loved it, but after a while it got old. Still a classic song though. <br /> <br />2. Rock & Roll: I don't know about this song. I've never really liked the overall feel to it. The beginning of the song just doesn't do it for me, it gets better toward the chorus with the, lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely time part. But I still don't care much for it. And once again I have heard this song millions of times on the radio. <br /> <br />3. The Battle of Evermore: This is a great track. I love the use of the Mandolin in this one. I think this one is one of the better songs on the album, definately better than Black Dog and Rock & Roll. <br /> <br />4. Stairway to Heaven: This is another one of those songs that's been on the radio a whole bunch, but it still sounds fresh to me everytime I hear it. Stairway to Heaven is arguably Led Zeppelin's greatest song, and I think that it is one of the reasons why this album is hailed by so many people as the best one. <br /> <br />5. Misty Mountain Hop: This one has been played on the radio occassionally, but it's not overplayed like the first two. But it's not one of the better songs on this album either. Don't get me wrong, it's a good song, but not among Led Zeppelin's better ones. <br /> <br />6. Four Sticks: I like this song a lot. It's one of those that hasn'tbeen played much on the radio, but I like the overall feel to it. I like the chord changes and the vocals. This one rates up there with Battle of Evermore and Stairway to Heaven. <br /> <br />7. Going to California: This is a nice song, but it suffers from being overplayed as well. This one is sort of like a breather in between Four Sticks and When the Levee Breaks. I like it. <br /> <br />8. When the Levee Breaks: When the Levee Breaks is an awesome song. Starting out with the bluesy harmonica and going for 7 minutes. This is one is my third favorite on the album behind Stairway to Heaven and Battle of Evermore. <br /> <br />So in review, Led Zeppelin IV is a great classic rock album, but it's not as good as it's hyped up to be. I do recommend your getting this album, if just to fill your collection. Led Zeppelin remains one of the most important and influential Rock bands of all time, and this album is one of their best.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch this film at my local movie theatre, which was screening the Telluride Film Festival. Of course, the subject of the film makes it that much more compelling. I  was really knocked out by the precious film footage of early Dylan performances. The film spends considerable time on Dylan's very early years and the burgeoning folk scene. I was also glad to see that Al Kooper gets his due in this film. There is also great (recent) interview footage of many Greenwich Village characters of the era. The film is hysterically funny in some parts as well. But probably the most interesting aspects are of the footage of his Royal Albert Hall concert and the press conferences he endured as well as the boos and jeers after going electric. Just a magnificent piece of work. When will Scorcese get his due? But - he also owes a debt to those who had the cameras rolling way back when, too!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I (like a lot of people, it seems) missed this series when it aired.  I'm not typically a fan of Joss Whedon's series, but this one is absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br />The writing is original.  The cinematography and set lighting are very good.  I really like the eclectic mix of cultural past, present, and future that is portrayed in the movie.  Any show that can pull off a 19h century formal ball with a futuristic floating chandelier in the same room is great, in my book. <br /> <br />This series is highly recommended to anyone that is missing some really good sci fi.
6305949980|5.0|I give this film 5 stars because I don't have more to give. <br />I just bought this Special Edition DVD and I just love it. I saw this movie many years ago and sincerely I didn't remember almost anything, but now with this DVD I had the opportunity to live again the experience of TNBC and I was simply amazed!!!. <br />The movie has a Broadway Musical feeling, the songs are awesome, and here are some little news for you. I bought the Edition made specially for Latin America, and the film has the entire audio in Spanish and Portuguese, including the songs !!! The translation is perfect (I speak the three languages) and the singers are very good (Perhaps not as great as the originals) but its very delightful to listen Jack and the whole cast singing in spanish and portuguese. <br />The extra features were not translated. The faults in this version are that VINCENT is not included, neither the trailers,and the audio is 5.1 (not DTS)in English and Dolby Digital in Spanish and Portuguese but anyway, I can sacrifice those for having the latin audio. <br />The name of this version is \\"El EXTRAO MUNDO DE JACK\\" in spanish or \\"O ESTRANHO MUNDO DE JACK\\" in Portuguese. <br />Enjoy it !!!
B00004ZDVQ|5.0|Stevie Wonder wrote an awful lot of really terrible sappy songs in the '80s and '90s.  However, from 1970-1981-- the time covered by this excellent set-- he was the Beatles of black pop, covering a staggering amount of stylistic ground and redefining Motown production.  This collection-- along with \\"Talking Book\\" and the astonishing \\"Songs in the Key of Life\\"-- is crucial.    This set opens with \\"Frontline,\\" where WOnder blasts the American Viet Nam adventure, and continues throuh some of the finest music of the '70s.  Indeed, on \\"Boogie On, Reggae WOman,\\" Wonder wrote the greatest-- and funkiest-- song of his career, making the weird irony of a blind singer's \\"I wanna see you boogie right across the floor\\" perfectly match his sense that love is transformative in a pretty basic and yet mystical sense.  \\"I Wish\\" shows us just how well this man can arrange horns, and even the disc's slower songs-- not my favorites-- are so good that Stevie would repeat pieces of them for the next 30 years or so.      Wonder negotiated into his 1970 contract a provision that would allow him to produce himself.  And he took full advantage.  Where so much early '70s Motown now sounds so dated-- the cardboard box drums, the chopped horns, the chunky arrangements-- this collection shows just how far Stevie was able to push his production ideas.  \\"Frontline\\" rides a fluid electric guitar riff and actually jams out at the end, and on \\"Boogie On,\\" the bongos and scratching rotate around a weirdly effective-- and synthetic!-- bassline.      This colleciton showcases some of the best funk ever written.  Makes you want to shake, grab the drums and play along.  WOnder can write love, politics and childhood memory perfectly, and does what black music does best-- build an imaginary community on the dancefloor.  Chuck D of Public Enemy would capture it perfectly fifteen years later when he said of political music \\"If you can't swing this/learn the words/you might sing this.\\"  Stevie, however, lets you do all three.
B00000I07P|3.0|Tastes do change over time, and no matter how much I wish myself back to those days of junior high school and hair rock, I still can't bring myself to care much for this album.  Only for those still stuck in the 80's. Posers should stick with \\"New Jersey.\\"
B000AL730O|4.0|I'm a Beatles fanatic, but in no way do I love everything that was put out by each of them after striking it out on their own. This is the first McCartney album I've bought on it's release, so I was eagerly anticipating it, and I wasn't let down one bit. I do understand the complaint that there isn't as many upbeat rockers as there should be, but I appreciate this effort by Paul. Anyone can put out the same record over and over, but a true artist tries to progress, and I believe that's what he's done here. I don't find this album to be dull at all, on the contrary I find it quite interesting. Standouts include Fine Line, Jenny Wren (very reminiscent of Blackbird,) Friends to Go (a tribute to George, probably one of, if not my favorite,) and At The Mercy. This album ranges from the upbeat, to the introspective, all classic Paul. Maybe it's not for everyone, but I think a great portion of those who appreciate Paul as an artist, will appreciate Chaos.
B00005221M|5.0|This movie seems to move below the radar- but it is by far one of the best adaption of the Cooper-Classic. If you are looking for adventure, history, drama and the ultimate love-story \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is the one for you. Daniel Day-Lewis is breathtaking, so are the action-sequences and  - not to forget - the marvelous soundtrack. The expanded version includes once deleated scenes and offers (even if only a few minutes longer) a great outlook on Michael Mann's original vision.

However this year, he is faced with a dreaded killer known as Sirius Black.  <br /> <br />this movie truely mimick the art of J.K. Rowling's novel. the special effect of this movie has exceeded all expectations. for example, take the scene with the dementors. the computer animated creature can really send shivers down your spine.  <br />this promises to be the best movie in the Harry Potter series yet. with loads of surprises.
6304698690|5.0|I purchased The Secret Garden after reading the book.  The movie was well made even though it deviated from parts in the book i.e. how the key was found and character interaction.<br /><br />It was overall great.  A good book and movie for families looking for clean, appropriate viewing material.  The children actors and actresses did very well.  The scenery and sets were beautiful.  I recommend this movie to everyone.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Greenday are rock gods in their own right, they didnt need to go and make an album that would sell over seven million copies world wide, but they did. American Idiot hold tracks with hard hitting beats. the soothing vocals of billie armstrong are sure to grab your attention. the best thing about this album is that you dont need to be a rock junky to enjoy the music, this beat is for anyone who just wants to drown out the crowd and lose themselves in there own little world.  <br />Well done Greenday, Youve done it again
B0002OERI0|5.0|Ok, so I just got back from their concert, so I may be a little biased, but this album is the best rock album to come out in years. Those that say they are sellouts, well yeah their right. They don't do garage rock shows anymore if that's what you think selling out is. They cannot live off Dookie for the rest of there lives!  There past two albums have sunk Green Day deeper into the \\"has-beens\\" category. They needed something different, and American Idiot is that. It's more mature, unusual (sitar music, 9 minute songs, and political vents). Great songs, great sound, great buy... <br />  <br />
0553802534|5.0|Having never read a Lisa Gardner novel before, I had no idea what to expect.  What a pleasant surprise!  I took this book to work with me to read on breaks and ended up sneaking it inside a manual to read throughout the day (it was worth the possible suspension)!  This story was so well-crafted, the characters had great depth and dimension, and the plot was original and captivating. This book was more entertaining than several movies I have seen lately and was quite suspenseful. Needless to say, I finished the story in a day and am looking forward to reading Ms. Gardner's other works.
B00028HBKM|4.0|This film, I have to admit, was goriest film I have ever seen. That's the first thing I can think of. I don't know if one will ever superceede it. It'll be tough.<br /><br />The Passion follows the last days of Jesus on earth and is an accurate portrayal of Jesus as he's seen in the gospels. Of course, there is a dispute in New Testament scholarship as to whether or not Jesus said and did many of the things the gospels attribute to him. Putting that debate aside for a second, Mr. Gibson does a realistic job (really, there was a lot of blood in this film) of showing us the Jesus whom Christians believe was divine, redeeming humankind and putting it right with G-d.<br /><br />Whatever the nature of Jesus was, as well as the New Testament texts, you'll find this film extremely moving. It could be a powerful account of G-d acting in history or a celebration of the human religious imagination.<br /><br />Also recommended: How to Lose Your Faith in Divinity School
B000AADYYO|5.0|OPETH - Ghost Reveries  <br />- <br />Brutality and Beauty is the contrast which best describes the mighty Opeth.  They return with their 8th album in just under 12 years...  <br />After coming off their split albums, Deliverance/Damnation many fans were left questioning what would there next release would sound like... Myself, as well as the majority of fans seem to be more than content with the further prog induced sounds as well as the addition of full time keyboardist Per Wiberg.   <br /> <br />The best part is that Opeth have not lost there edge... As most know, Opeth is legendary for opening their albums with their strongest song.  Ghost Reveries however, opens with a powerful 3-Punch combo: Ghost of Perdition, The Baying of the Hounds and Beneath the Mire.  In Truth the CD is worth it for these 3 tracks alone... but boy am I glad they included the other 5 tracks.  Reverie/Harlequin Forest is one of their most powerful tracks to date (The softer part in the middle is stunning) and The Grand Conjuration, their first single, is a power house of sheer force. Both similar tracks to first 3, continuing in traditional Opeth form (If there is indeed such a thing as Traditional Opeth?)  The Other 3 songs Atonement, Hours of the Wealth and Isolation Years are more along the lines of the softer side of the band such as the Damnation Album.    <br /> <br />Mikeal's voice has only become more powerful, his soothing voice on Hours of the Wealth is a testament to his musical ability... Or listen to his play between Death Growls and Clean Channel vocals on Beneath the Mire... Simply amazing! <br />The Guitar work between Akerfeldt and Lindgren is, as always, outstanding.   <br />Bassist Martin Mendez has stepped up to plate and delivered some of the finest bass work heard from Opeth since the Morningrise album.   <br />And the Drumming... oh the Drumming... Mr. Mendez has easily exceeded the high expectations he left after Deliverance/Damnation and steps up to the level of greats like Danny Carey (Tool), Brann Dailor (Mastodon) and Yanic (Quo Vadis)  <br />And I have to admit the permanent addition of Keys by Per Wiberg is a great addition to the bands sound. (He also does backing vocals)  This is especially true with their slower passages but even on the heavier tracks the added atmosphere furthers their heavier progressive sound.  <br /> <br />Though I can't say this is Opeth's best (That title will always belong to Still Life, then BWP) I can say that this is their most mature work to date.  And most likely the best spot for a new fan to start. <br /> <br />Also PLEASE DO NOT Compare this to Tool... I understand the confusion... When I first heard, Ghost of Perdition, I also thought gee-wilikers batman that sounds like Tool.  However upon listen to King Crimson extensively I realized that both these bands are influenced heavily by the great KC.   <br /> <br />Favorite Songs:  Beneath the Mire, Ghost of Perdition, and Hours of the Wealth <br />-5.

B00000J048|4.0|The toy is nice. The base pieces may not be as many as you would like to expand it more. my kid (3 yrs old) liked but I did most of the design :) It might be more expensive than I'd estimate it.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|While I love Celtic music, I generally avoid CD's with the word \\"Celtic\\" in the name. \\"Celtic Moods\\" or \\"Celtic Journey\\" or whatever -- they all seem like tired rehashes of the same 10 or 12 songs that I've heard before, and probably already have on other CD's.<br /><br />Happily, \\"Celtic Woman\\" is not at all like that. It's a refreshingly different sort of performance, featuring five very talented young women singing and performing traditional songs as well as several modern pieces, backed by a full orchestra including Celtic drums and harp, as well as a supporting vocal choir.<br /><br />Like many, I first found \\"Celtic Woman\\" on PBS. My wife and I were immediately enchanted by the talent of the performers and the variety of songs they played. There are several traditional songs, such as \\"Danny Boy\\" and a beautiful, lush vocal performance by M&eacute;av N&iacute; Mhaolchatha for \\"She Moved Through the Fair.\\" Modern songs are well-represented here as well, including a stirring version of Enya's \\"Orinoco Flow\\" sung by three of the women in the ensemble, an excellent re-envisioning of \\"You Raise Me Up,\\" the well-know Josh Groban song, taken on by all five ladies, and &Oacute;rla Fallon's simply gorgeous take on the Clannad song \\"Harry's Game.\\"<br /><br />Each of the women performs beautifully, but I find myself drawn to specific songs that really feature of them and their individual talents perfectly. Each of Chloë Agnew's songs are a marvel of pitch-perfect vocals, but I think the song that really stands out for me is her performace of Ennio Morricone's \\"Nella Fantasia.\\" Vocalist Sarah Brightman is famous for singing this song, but as far as I'm concerned, Chloë outshines her by a long shot. Similarly, Lisa Kelly outdoes Enya in her powerful and sincere rendition of \\"May It Be,\\" the Howard Shore song from \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\" While &Oacute;rla Fallon has several great songs on the album, it's the touching \\"Siuil A Run\\" that captures my heart with its flowing rhythms and lovely vocal landscapes. M&eacute;av N&iacute; Mhaolchatha is only featured in a couple performances, but \\"Si Do Mhaimeo I\\" at the end may be her best -- a steady and powerful beat and gorgeous vocals in lyrical Gaelic, with a helping hand from M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Nesbitt on the fiddle. And M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad is no slouch herself. She doesn't sing, but her fiddle-playing is present on several tracks, and is the featured performance in what may be the best track on the whole album, the astounding \\"Butterfly.\\"<br /><br />Simply put, this is a CD to be treasured, and a performance well worth preserving. All five of the women here are talented on their own merits, and when put together the raw beauty of their music is a force to be reckoned with. Celtic song, at its best, is beautiful and moving and exotic. This CD is all of that and more.ocal landscapes.

B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is a great band.  Amy Lee is a stunning vocalist who weaves her spell on you throughout the CD.  I play this all the time!!!!!
0141301155|5.0|OK, this reviewer had never read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - never saw the movie with Gene Wilder, and even though am a Johnny Depp fan, never saw the newest movie -<br /><br />I dropped my defenses and got this book, and was I surprised! This is one of the most charming books I have ever read - a tale of love and respect of family and the moral that what goes around comes around -<br /><br />It is gentle, it is poignant, it is a must read for kids and us kids at heart -<br /><br />Simply charming.
0345457684|4.0|It's my understanding that this is Morgan's first effort.  I'd say it's pretty good for that.  There are some weaknesses -- the Envoys come across as All-Stompin' SuperPeoples, which they may be, but it comes across as juvenile through the unsubtle intro.  I'd have preferred to be introduced to the Ass-Kickery more gradually. <br /> <br />The Universe that has been introduced seems reasonably interesting: probably enough so that I'll look into his other offerings.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|A lot of people do not like this particular film, but I do. Like the first one it has a darker atmosphere and is not as cheerful and somewhat funny as the others are. When I want to enjoy the humorous side of Star Trek I watch the Original Series. I do not necessarily need that in the movies as well. <br />And as one of my colleagues pointed out we get to see the Romulans, my favorite oponents. All in all it is my favorite Star Trek movie only second to Star Trek 1.
0060825219|5.0|One of the minor mysteries of life is why Paulo Coelho isn't better known in the United States. This new book is being published in 100 countries in 45 languages. It is the No. 1 best seller in 22 countries. His books are almost unknown in the United States.  <br /> <br />The Zahir, a Novel of Obsession is the new book. A Zahir (an Arabic word) means something that is visible, present and unable to go unnoticed. The story here is about a missing wife. The narrator is living in Paris when his wife Esther disappears in the Middle East. Also missing is her friend Mikhail, who may or may not be her lover. This is the background for the narrator to travel across Central Asia discovering more about himself than he ever expected.  <br /> <br />As this search becomes an obsession we learn more about the narrator, and in the end about ourselves. This is one sign of a good novelist. We are entertained by the story, but at the same time it forces us to think about ourselves; to learn, perhaps, something more of the world.
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|I loved this move ... It's one of the best Star Trek movies!
B00097DX3U|5.0|I was a little skeptical when I saw Audioslave's Out of Exile in the stores, but I gave it a spin and I'm really glad I did.  Out of Exile is a spectacular improvement on the band's self-titled debut.  The songs, in general, have less sonic baggage and far less filler.  I still occasionally listen to the first album, but the only songs that stay with me are \\"I am the Highway,\\" \\"Light My Way,\\" \\"Getaway Car\\" and \\"Cochise.\\"  Not a good percentage for an album with 15 songs on it.  The rest are nothing with nothing. <br /> <br />Out of Exile, on the other hand, is filled with songs that roll through my head even when I'm not listening to the album, and it's a pleasure to sing them to myself (unlike, say, that radio pop hit that gets stuck all day and makes you ill).  My favorites are \\"Your Time Has Come,\\" \\"Be Yourself,\\" \\"The Curse,\\" \\"Doesn't Remind Me,\\" \\"Yesterday to Tomorrow,\\" and \\"Dandelion.\\"  But all the songs are decent, and together they comprise the best rock album I've heard in years.  Months after I bought Out of Exile, I'm still listening to it pretty regularly, which is something that I can't say for the majority of music that I buy.
B000AJJNOK|2.0|The only reason that this CD deserves any stars, is the fact that it has a few decent beats. On the other hand, this CD is not even half as good as his first CD which was still a heap of garbage. Now he has \\"blessed\\" us with his life story and a movie to top it. Its too bad that Tupac never got the opportunities that 50 Cent has received. Rap music died with Tupac and it needs someone to revive it. 50 Cent is not the answer to the dying rap music scene. However, he seems to think that he is. I listened to his unreleased CD called \\"The Power of the Dollar\\" which was never released due to bootlegging. That CD was actually really good. However, the fame got to him. 50 Cent can't sell a CD without standing on the front with his shirt off. If sex really does sell, than that may be the only thing that 50 Cent has going for him because his lyrics aren't going to sell his music. God help us all.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I saw the japaneese version and was very pleased with it. Surprises and old faces. this is what we needed, a return of a classic tale with a new story. This is a must have to any Final Fantasy collection,as well as to see what FF7 has to offer in the future. With that I will leave it a secret. FF7 isn't done yet. This was just the beginning.
B000AL730O|5.0|Best solo album since Flaming Pie. He is back with a vengence.
B000001FDQ|1.0|That Mr. Malmsteen can play lots of notes in rapid succession is beyond dispute, so, on a strict reckoning of note per unit currency paid for this CD, you do very well. However, I could have done with fewer notes and some music. It would have been nice had Mr. M. thought to include some. But he didn't. Perhaps he can't. So, what you get, essentially, is one of those dreadful heavy metal solos prolonged for an entire CD. In the end, I couldn't finish this indigestible noise and sold it off at a loss ASAP. Approach with caution.
0385338686|2.0|I found this book sooo predictable, well I know this kind of books are predictable but this was way over the top, and so dull It make me feel like I was a Kindergartner reading a story so unbelievable. I got this book just to have a little laugh and feel entertained but when I was half of the book I was more indignant than amuse. The shopaholic books were much better than this.
1573221562|5.0|This book was shared. It took us by surprise here, the Victorian suspense with subtle lesbian erotic content is not one that any of us might usually choose.  We rate it as a 5 because it is a novel that we discussed for days after.  I will read it again one day to try to see how it was so masterfully crafted.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I haven't watched any westerns in a long time but when I saw it at the local library, I thought I'd give it a whirl, especially with the cast headed by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, how bad could it be?  I was so blown away by their performance and just how rough and romantic they were.  It started my new found love of westerns.   <br /> <br />Lonesome Dove is a must have, I had to have it for my own. I must have watched it at least 3 times already.  The performances by R. Duvall and T.L.Jones are classic and priceless. So far I have seen almost everything labeled Lonesome Dove but they have not come up to par of the first one, although they are entertaining and quenches my thirst for more of Lonesome Dove.  This dvd is a must have for any library!
B000059T00|5.0|this is a very rare album primarily because it brought together rare talents for a very short period of time.    clapton and baker were from cream. steve winwood from traffic. and rich grech was from the family.    the music in the album is distinguished by steve winwood's superb vocals (soulful black voice trapped in a white body!), rare melodic fretwork by clapton and very artful drumming by the great ginger baker.    the opening track, 'had to cry today' with its bass/lead/percussion (with baker you better believe it!) riff is a long song - with some extended very melodic interplayed/overdubbed guitar work by clapton. clapton's guitar sounds very different here from his work with mayall or cream. on mtv i've seen a rare and brief footage of a blind faith concert where clapton is shown using a fender telecaster (it is possible that the use of the tele gave him that tone).    'cant find my way home' is a very popular track where winwood uses his vocal prowess to the max backed by some artful acoustic fretwork by clapton.    'well allright' is a rousing number where baker pounds the hides with abandon!    'in the presence of the lord' showcases one of the most memorable wah wah lead intros in rock'n'roll followed by some fiery yet melodic fretwork.    'sea of joy' follows and finally the closing track 'do what you like' where every band member shows off his instrumental prowess. where winwood winds up his keyboard solo and where clapton starts off his guitar solo is a sonic moment par excellence. rick grech provides an adequate bass solo (which makes ones wonder how the band would have shaped up had the great jack bruce taken up bass duties!) and baker comes out with a fantastic lyrical drum solo (or as lyrical as a drum solo can get)!    as noted before this is a very rare album and only a band of this calibre could have produced such music.     pity - good things never last!
B00003CXBH|5.0|Saw \\"The Mission\\" years ago, when it first hit the movie theaters. Was much impressed then with the acting, the story, the music, and the message. <br /> <br />After all these years I still consider \\"The Mission\\" to be one of the best films I've ever seen.  <br /> <br />
B000089RVR|3.0|I truly adored her first album, loved it from begining to end.  And this...\\"Life For Rent\\", I couldn't grab hold of it as her \\"No Angel\\".  It wasn't as great as her first.  What happened?  It could have been so much better.  I was really disappointed.  The songs that are good were\\" \\"White Flag\\", \\"Don't Leave home\\", \\"Life for Rent\\" and \\"Sand in my Shoes\\".  I really didn't care for the others too much.  I just hope her third album will be better.  I mean I love Dido, I really don't think she can sing all that well, but her voice is nice, not all that great, but nice.  I wish her luck on her third album, if she makes one.
B00079FUI6|5.0|This is one of those programs you can watch a dozen times and not get tired of. I bought the DVD the day it came out and was not disappointed. It was so fun to relive Mike and Susan's romance, as well as the many other twisted and funny storylines. The extras are great and the sound and picture quality are boffo. Wonderful.

B000025XKM|3.0|Nick Drake is one of those artists who is well known enough that alot of people have heard of him but just obscure enough that music snobs (critics, Et. Al) revere him. I have to wonder though how many people cite him as an influence and rhapsodize about how brilliant this album is while not having listened to it for months. Why? THE ALBUM IS [...] BORING! Seriously I wonder how many people have bought this album because someone like Michael Stipe or Kurt Cobain or Spin Magazine have cited it as this brilliant masterwork and have gone out and bought it, gotten home and put it on only to be confronted with total 70's easy listening hippy dippy qualude music. \\"But\\" they will ask themselves \\"all these other people cite him as this brilliant artist and he died a semi romantic death (possible suicide while relativley unknown and underappreciated) only to be discovered and properly appreciated years after his death\\". So they try to convince themselves that they really like it all the while never listening to it because deep down inside they really know that there are a million other things they would rather be listening to and/or doing besides listening to Nick Drake.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|The Editorial review from Amazon... <br /> <br />Is that guy an intern who just finished High School or College and discovered he liked music a few years ago? <br /> <br />1. Dumb to compare contemeraries, unless they too are comparing themselves.  Bright Eyes?  Who cares what he does in relationship to Ryan Adams, save they are both marketable commodities that comparing them might improve sales.  I don't personally see the comparrison. <br /> <br />2. Dylan got big in his own time too...  Not a sell out though, but I agree with others, Dylan is Dylan, Adams is Adams...  Why are we always doing that, \\"The next Hendrix\\", \\"The Next Dylan\\"?  But to risk comparing, Dylan borrowed, emulated, and paid homage to his contemporaries and predicessors and so did most of the great musicians we remember (especially the \\"innovators\\"), and he was Dylan. So why is it suddenly a bad thing. <br /> <br />3. Most reviews I've read are really short-sighted and lack musical history.  Something, that despite rumors of his ego, or whatever (since we aren't friends, and I only know that I like his music, I don't actually care about), Ryan Adams does not lack a sense of musical history.  He can innovate and entertain (which is largely what music is about) and still play music with a sense of history. <br /> <br />This Album, to me shows off flavors of the Grateful Dead, early Neil Young, Roy Orbison, Graham Parsons, and many, many others (mentioned above and not). Innovators in country infused, bluegrass infused, American traditional or folk infused rock.  It's new and certainly Ryan Adams' while being a bit of a \\"hats-off\\" to some great music.  Some of the songs could be straight out of, for example a Grateful Dead songbook, while others could not be anything but Ryan Adams, and the Album as a whole certainly bears his calling card. <br /> <br />I think it's a great album, I have liked it very much as traveling music.  But, I don't think it is retro, and I don't know about innovative, but it's certainly different from the last albums (as is his norm), and what else I know of going on in music, so I think that in itself is innovative (these days), not that it needs to be, to be good. <br /> <br />I certainly would recommend this album, and look forward to whatever he does next.
0425105709|5.0|ONE, TWO, BUCKLE MY SHOE has not, I think, topped anyone's list of favorite Agatha Christies for many years.  Re-reading it again after many years, it seems to me to share some similarities to CURTAIN, Poirot's last case.  Both of them are sort of bloodless, intellectual thrillers that play with ideas in a modernist way.  BUCKLE is all about the cult of the superman, in this case the sacred financier Alistair Blunt, the Bernard Baruch type moneymind whom Britain \\"needs\\" and whose wellbeing is necessary to prevent the collapse of the UK economy.  The attitude of the police and the secret service is, He may have his peccadilloes, but by Jove we need him in this country.  In CURTAIN, which must have been written about the same time, the superman takes a darker turn, he is the man who can inspire others to commit murder for him, by the power of suggestion, but anyone who finishes ONE, TWO, BUCKLE MY SHOE will know why I linked these two books on this one point.<br /><br />I was surprised and shocked by the ending.  Only Poirot could have figured out all the ramifications of the case, as well as to pull out the identity of the killer's accomplice out of thin air.  I don't feel that Christie was using \\"fair play\\" in this novel, but it is so baffling that I don't even care!  I love reading about her tormented, independent young women who cab't stand their own lives and yearn for something better--in this case. Jane Oliveira, the financier's niece.  I wonder if elements of this novel didn't find their way into Ben Hecht's screenplay for Hitchcock's film NOTORIOUS.  It's all about how you live with yourself when you're doing something wrong if it is for the public good, or if you can persuade yourself that it is while you're committing the crime (or sin, to be moral about it).<br /><br />BUCKLE, like CURTAIN, is a little vague about--is there a war going on or not?  Maybe it is set in an alternate universe in which others are fighting the war so we don't have to talk about it.  In today's political climate, that kind of aesthetic amnesia rings a bell.  Back then, it was a remarkably daring feat for the always experimental Agatha Christie.ut it.  In today's political climate, that kind of aesthetic amnesia rings a bell.

B00000DFMM|5.0|Incredible album.  I must have listened to it a thousand times, never get tired of it and don't think I ever will.  I always find myself putting it on in the car when I get tired of my \\"new\\" music.  20 years later it still seems as fresh as the day in 1986 I first bought the vinyl LP.  If it weren't for owning a CD copy, I would have worn out my LP long, long ago!  \\"A Secret Wish\\" is completely mesmerizing and everlasting.
B0002OERI0|1.0|They were best back in the 90's when punk was just as good as the punk in the late 70's and 80's, now, its like, punk rock sucks now, Green Day sucks now.  ALl Green Day ever sounded like was Miracle Legion back in the 80's, only pumped up.

0316168815|4.0|Sebold, Alice.  The Lovely Bones.  Boston:  Little, Brown and Company, 2002.  Pp. 328.   ISBN:  0-316-66634-3.  <br /> <br /> <br /> The Lovely Bones is a novel set around a fictitious but all too realistic tragedy of a young girl's disappearance and murder.  The narrator and main character of the novel, Susie, tells her story from heaven as we the reader follow her family and friends through a very grueling and evolving process of grief and acceptance.  The author of this novel is fairly new to the world of literature, though she has formerly written for both the New York Times and Chicago Tribune.  Alice Sebold has one other published book under her belt, a memoir entitled Lucky which was published in 1999.  With the publication of The Lovely Bones, she is being hailed by many as a promising new voice in literature.   This novel explores the range of emotion, memory, and healing that goes along with one of the more terrible tragedies that a family can face.  Beginning with the narrator's murder, the book takes the reader to many different levels of human suffering and strength.  Rather than being a murder mystery, the plot travels along a much more personal and connected path with a girl trying to come of age in death as she never could in life.   <br /> The main character, Susie Salmon, is forced to watch but never participate in the lives of her friends and family after her brutal murder.  In her heaven, Susie is surrounded by whatever her heart desires, yet it is the living still on Earth that she finds the hardest to let go of.  Her death is faced differently by every member of her family, with her father's eventual decline and breakdown, as well as her mother's futile attempts at escape from her pain and duties of being a mother.  Lost in her grief, Susie's mother distances herself from her husband and family through an emotionless affair and even moves across the country for several years, as she tries desperately \\"to find a doorway out of her ruined heart,\\"(197).  Susie's younger sister, Lindsey is forced to mature much quicker than she might have normally, and becomes the stabling force in her family's house, a strength that their father and youngest brother draw from time and time again.  It is Lindsey who remains calm and understanding to her father's disprovable theories concerning her sister's death, and it is Lindsey that the younger brother always runs to in need of comfort or explanation during their mother's absence.  Susie's friends Ruth and Ray are also objects of her close attention.  Living out her junior high romance with Ray vicariously through Ruth, Susie watches happily as the two graduate high school and then college, while always honoring Susie's memory in their hearts.  <br /> After her father suffers a heart-attack, Susie's mother is compelled to return home, and for the first time in nearly ten years after their loss, the family finds itself back together once again. For the first time since Susie's death, they are able to accept the fact that they are living and continuing on without feeling that they are betraying Susie's memory.  These connections are what Susie observes as \\"the lovely bones,\\"(320), the realizations made after she was gone.  Around this same time, she witnesses the accidental but just death of her murderer, Mr. Harvey, who although much suspected, was never caught.  It is after seeing her reunited family that Susie can finally find and accept comfort in her heaven, and it is on a very inspiring note that she bids the reader farewell. <br /> The target audience of this book is teen to adult, due to the sometimes gripping description of Susie's death and other adult themes.  I feel the general population would enjoy this book, though I would imagine some mixed reactions regarding the plausibility of some supernatural elements of the story, especially Susie's description of heaven and her ability to watch over others.  Some of these ideas of the afterlife may not agree with everyone else's, or the Bible's, but this is a story worth suspending any reservations about because of its beautiful message. <br /> I personally loved the book and would definitely recommend it to others because it's beautifully written.  The characters are so intricately developed and complex that they are impossible not to care about, and the author's use of language keeps the plot flowing effortlessly for the reader.  I commend the author for her graceful approach to this otherwise horrible subject, and weaving throughout it the perfect balance of sadness, honesty, and humor.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />  <br />  <br />
0671027387|4.0|this book was again a gem like all of mr browns other books.when i bought this book i decided i will read it slowly and complete it in about a month but once i started reading it i just cant keep it down & read it in just two reads.everything in it from its plot to suspense,story,thrill & ofcourse the deception everything was top class. this is one of the greatest books and if u havent read it please! please ! please! read it because u are missing one of the life time experiences.also dont forget to read all other titles of mr brown(\\"THE DA VINCI CODE\\",\\"DIGITAL FORTRESS\\",\\"ANGELS & DEMONS\\")
0930289528|2.0|I really enjoyed 'From Hell' and thought that the first volume of 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' was brilliant. <br />'V for Vendetta', however, posesses little of that quality. I found it to be very two-dimentional and introspective. It reaches for an epic scale, but comes across like an adolescent in-joke. This graphic novel might play better to youths than Moore's other works- but clearly NOT to adults.
0151008116|5.0|One of the best books I ever read.  I can't imagine someone not enjoying it.   <br />I had trouble putting it down.
0805066691|5.0|I read this book quite a few years ago, but up until that time I looked at George Armstrong Custer as an American hero. After reading this book I realized what he really was...a mass murderer!  <br />This book will break your heart, and possibly bring you to tears, but it is a great read. It tells the history we were all taught in school from the other side, the side no one wanted us to know as children. Read this book and you'll agree with me. True american history, with no punches pulled. <br /> <br />
B0009353IW|5.0|It would not matter if this album's lyrics were fodder, kootchie-koo filler, standing on the corner balderdash, the music is so totally wonderful, in a wonderful polyglot of Mexkin and Merkin styles, that you will find this record irresistible.  <br /> <br />I guarantee it. <br /> <br />The fact that it is also a rather esoteric rock opera about the building of a baseball stadium matters (I'm a baseball fan), but it isn't essential. Listening to Chavez Ravine makes one wonder why every record that's made doesn't have incredible music tuned to awesome lyrics with a progressive theme. <br /> <br />Without a doubt, a great album of music.
B000002H5I|4.0|I bought this cd in 1988 when it came out and I absolutely loved all the songs. Tracey Chapman is unique in that not many artists bring up political issues and social problems in such a disarming fashion. With songs such as \\"Fast Car\\" she manages to be political and passionate yet enjoyable. Knowing her other works, one has to admire an artist such as Chapman, through sixteen years as an artist, she has managed to remain faithfully loyal to her path. It may not be for everyone, but if you are looking for something that has substance (not meaningless words or profanity)this is good album to begin with and then you can decide if you want to move on to her other albums.
B00003CX5P|5.0|First of all, I don't have the DVD, I have the video. Second of all, This is a good movie. You will hear a lot of things such as it's not my Star Wars, Jar Jar sucks ect. The thing is, its mostly adults who complain. They don't understand that this movie was not made for them. The original star wars movies were meant for the kids of that time. The prequels are meant for the kids of this generation. Kids find Jar Jar funny. They love the podraces. So adults everywhere, zip it!!!! Note:the reviewer is my Dad. I'm a KID. You know, the ones that the star wars movies are meant for.
B00025ETIW|3.0|Ill never understand why \\"metalcore\\" people like this band which is the weekest of the emo/screamo/noise-core sub genre but absolutely hate everything else and think its trying to destroy \\"real rock\\".  <br /> <br />Go back to listening to Lamb of God and take this with you.  <br /> <br />Everyone else go pick up Silverstein's new album or if you like harder stuff Chariot's new album
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is a very good CD.  All the tracks meld together smoothly to create a wonderful mood.  Highly recommended.
B000641ZA4|5.0|I was interested in this from when I first heard about it on the Genesis music forums, and was not disappointed when I got it.  Quite the opposite!<br /><br />The packaging design is great (although a little cheap), and shares the same style as The Platinum Collection CD set, but this DVD is a real treat even for long-term fans who may not have seen this collection of Genesis' videos before.  I personally have been a fan for over 10 years now and had never seen two-thirds of the material on this DVD.<br /><br />Simply the sheer number of music videos on this DVD make it worthwhile, despite the lack of extra features or commentary.  The biggest treats on this DVD are \\"Robbery, Assault & Battery\\", \\"The Carpet Crawlers 1999\\", and \\"A Trick of the Tail,\\" since they are so rare.<br /><br />If you are a new fan, I recommend The Platinum Collection over The Video Show, as it covers the breadth of all of Genesis' work.  But if you're like me, and consider yourself a serious Genesis fan, this DVD is a must-have.
B00005MAM2|3.0|Eventhough,the art of anime had advanced considerably. This landmark Anime film still entertains. However,the DVD,I received  had periods where it seemed to halt momentarily. But,it didn't take away from the films enjoyment.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If I had time to write a real review I would. But then it would be some twenty pages long tell you how good this series is and how dumb FOX was to not give it the respect it deserved. Buy this DVD series and share it with friends.
0515123447|4.0|Just discovered Lee Child and have been trying to read everything I can find.  The Killing Floor is great, as is his newest one \\"One Shot\\".
B0001MDP3G|3.0|The biggest problem with this movie is that it simply cannot compare to Charles Frazier's novel. However, there's only so much you can expect when a film is adapted from a book, and overall, the movie \\"Cold Mountain\\" isn't all that bad...but I still think it could have been better.<br /><br />In the film, Jude Law plays Inman, a Confederate soldier who deserts the battlefront after surviving a serious injury. He encounters many hurdles in his attempt to return to Cold Mountain and to Ada (Nicole Kidman), a woman he fell in love with following a very brief encounter prior to his departure. The film flashes back and forth to Inman's adventures and Ada's struggle to survive on her farm following the death of her father. She is fortunate to have the assistance of the free-spirited Ruby (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger), with whom she forms a powerful friendship that feeds her spirit and gives her the strength to keep on believing that Inman will return to her someday.<br /><br />I'm usually a big fan of Kidman's work, but her performance in \\"Cold Mountain\\" was a bit disappointing. I'm not sure if that's a reflection on her as an actress or on Ada's character, which is kind on one-dimensional. Law's performance is acceptable but not extraordinary, and the real star of the film is Zellweger, whose portrayal of Ruby is vibrant and also downright hilarious at times. Natalie Portman also has a small but strong part as a woman that Law's character encounters along his journey home, and Brendan Gleeson does a great job in the role of Ruby's deadbeat father, Stobrod.<br /><br />The first forty minutes of the film are incredibly dry...I almost had to turn it off. However, things picked up after a while and the film got much better as it went along. The movie just doesn't have the same emotional appeal as the novel, which is why I can't give it a high recommendation.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|You thought you liked Pride & Prejudice, Emma, Persuasion, JAne Eyre etc etc...well you are about to enter another level of period drama heaven....RUN don't walk to buy this one, buy two, because you will be lending it out to all your friends...  Why?  The most compelling story from an excellent novel, the tightest, leanest script by Sandy Welch, the superb cinematography and production design, make this the best period drama I have ever seen, it makes the others pale into comparision.    The actors are a fantastic ensemble, including the superb Sinead Cusack as Mrs Thornton the matriach, Daniela Denby-Ashe is the spirited and lovely heroine Margaret, and Richard Armitage who plays Mr Thornton is the most talented, brooding, smouldering, intelligent, moving and compelling leading man it has been my pleasure ever to witness.....this man was robbed of a BAFTA - he is nothing short of magnificent...  and it's not just for women, it's a sad, funny, romantic, stirring story of loss, love and struggle that anyone can enjoy.. and I believe you will enjoy this.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|The DVD and CD are both fantastic, you won't be disappointed.  In fact, my 8 year old daughter and I like several of the live versions better than the originals.  Plus, I think Dido is very personable, cute, and sexy, which doesn't hurt.  On the other hand, she doesn't flaunt her attractiveness, which is a relief for a father of a young girl these days.  I can't wait until her next album.
B000002G8H|4.0|This is not a five star album. HOwever, it is a sold outing by slowhand. The thing I like about this album and Clapton's solo albums in general are the hidden gems that don't get played on FM. May you never, peaches and diesel, etc. are all great songs that belie the laid back, songwriters side of Clapton that gets smokescreened under all of his guitar work. This is what he meant when he said that he was inspired by the likes of the Band and Dylan.
B0000025F7|5.0|There's nothing I can say aboout this album that haven't been said by everybody who feels it as much as I do. Except for the fact that it's the best disco album ever recorded. <br /> <br />The sheer originality and imagination of this classic album is enough to put Donna Summer's whole catalog to shame. Off the Wall also boasts memorable hooks (Choruses) that The Bee gees wish they had on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. <br /> <br />The reason why I go as far as to call this the best disco album is because Michael brought a more soulful feel to the songs, which made the songs seem more authentic.  Quincy Jones also pushes the disco beat to the background (slightly) to give more attention to the grooves (rhythms) as well as the vocals. As a result Quincy is able to prove that disco can have credibility when it's in the hands of the right producer. with Mike's vocal sincerity, and quincy sparse approach to to the disco beat, Off the Wall has aged better than all other disco albums. It holds up well in 2005. <br /> <br />Another thing I love about the album is that Quincy Jones never overdid anything in the beats. Unlike all other disco albums, which might lean too heavily on orchestraed strings and ignore everything else, quincy knows when to bring in the horns, and when to bring in the breakbeats, etc. In other words, he knew when to let a good thing quit which makes the music all the more clear and focused. <br /> <br />When they had the disco demolition in Comisky Park  back in 79, instead of using dynamite, they should've used this album as a wrecking ball. Simply because it's so good it crushes the h*ll out of all other disco artists and albums. <br /> <br />DISCO MAY'VE BURNED OUT A LONG TIME AGO, BUT OFF THE WALL CAN STILL TURN UP THE HEAT AT ANY PARTY ON ANY DANCEFLOOR.    <br /> <br />
B0002DB0FO|4.0|Beautiful scenery, good ensemble acting, nice dialogue. <br />Very plesant way to spend an hour or so.
0553212621|5.0|People are often confused about sex, not only when this novel was written, but even in this seemingly oversexed era.  <br /> <br />DH Lawrence wrote this lyric and sensual book, where the heroine Lady Chatterley, who was well-born and well bred, happens to be married to an invalid, whose injuries were sustained in World War I. Her husband is a baronet, Sir Clifford. <br /> <br />The love interest in the book is Sir Clifford's gamekeeper. Connie Chatterley is not a virgin when she has this affair, but Mellors, (the gamekeeper) awakens her to life, to higher consciousness that comes with tender lovemaking.  <br /> <br />It would be insultingly simplistic to say that Lawrence believed lovemaking is really the solution to the poison of industry, mechanization, and lack of awareness and connectedness to one's environment. Although the invalid and sexually incapable Sir Clifford is a symbol of the impotence of modern mechanization, Lawrence believed that lovemaking is only the solution when it's done right. In other words, with tenderness. The author was certainly not advocating misogyny or meaningless sex. He was saying, with sexual love where the lovers have body awareness, as opposed to cerebral awareness, which is from the mind, only part of the body. <br /> <br />Do we have too much sex in our age? What Lawrence would probably say, is that we have too much cerebral sex. We are not connected to our lovemaking.  <br /> <br />This book is not pornography. Any one who believes that it is porno should read Lawrence's essay entitled \\"Pornography\\", where Lawrence ridicules pornography. Why? Because it does dirt on sex; it makes sex look dirty. In reality, pornographers hate sex; they make it look ugly and trite.  <br /> <br />In a digital internet age, like the industrial age of the 1920s, there is no connectedness with the body and the world. Our age is filled with pornography but not filled with the kind of sex Lawrence believed in. The search continues. <br />

B000957O82|4.0|This is a movie that could've gone wrong in so many ways, and in some ways it did. The film does however have a marginal understanding of relationships coupled with some pretty good acting. <br /> <br />I was surprized just how much of the movie didn't make it into the trailers. This was a completely different film than advertised. The commercials make it seem like Will Smith completely loses all face after meeting Eva Mendez, that he's reduced to a blithering idiot for the sake of comic relief. In actuality, he maintains his composure only occasionally screwing up, but he always seems to screw up in good will, making understandable mistakes. <br /> <br />The film pays special attention to the characters' self-consciousness. It understands how hard it is for a man to start a meaningful relationship with a perfect stranger, but it also shows that women go though the same feelings. There's a great scene where Eva Mendez wakes up, expecting to find Will Smith on her couch after being treated for food allergies. Realizing he's gone, she breaks down, crying into her pillow. Of course when Hitch bursts through the door with the coffee he went out to buy, she immediately picks herself up and frantically tries to do her hair before he sees her. <br /> <br />When watching Hitch, I couldn't help but be reminded of another film that could've gone horribly wrong, The 40-Year-Old Virgin. It's amazig just how many of the same sight gags are used in both films, in most cases, at the same point in the film. The body wax, the speed dating, the guy being involved in a potentially fatal, yet funny, car accident, the wedding/dance number. Between the two, Virgin is the superior film, but Hitch still works. <br /> <br />The only drawbacks come from the dialog, which always sounds a little too clever to be spur of the moment, but it still conveys the brutal honesties about love. Hitch is definitely worth the watch. <br /> <br />PS: I watched it with a girl last week. This week we're going out.
B000AA4LAK|4.0|Hot Fuss is simply an excellent album.  For major fans, the bonus songs are a nice plus, but most hardcore fans have found these tracks already.  Case in point, I was at a Killers concert, and the fans already knew the words to the previously unreleased tracks.  I bought the album because I leant out my original copy and never got it back.  With all that having been said, the bonus tracks are worth the purchase if you're having trouble finding them.  Of couse, if you haven't purchased Hot Fuss, buy this album now!  You will not regret it.
B000002UAR|5.0|In all of my adult life,I've heard all kinds of things about the Beatles. I wasn't even born in 1964,but I know that Dave Dexter,Jr. sucks.I know about the \\"More popular than God\\" statement from 1966.I know about the Paul is dead rumour fom the late sixties,The how to break up a band in thirty easy steps a/k/a The White Album stories.The Get Back/Let It Be/Phil Spector fiasco that was 1969 and 1970.I also know The Beatles released many classic albums in their brief reign and \\"Revolver\\" proves just that.No,not the edited version that came out in the U.S. but the original version WITH \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\",\\"Doctor Robert\\"and \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" in tow.George Harrison's \\"Taxman\\" begin's one helluva great album! Usually I'm a JL fan ,but this time out he and PM both shone.I'm Only Sleeping,Doctor Robert,And Your Bird Can Sing,Tommorow Never Knows,Here There And Everywhere,Eleanor Rigby,For No One,Got To Get You Into My Life,Yellow Submarine (Sung By Ringo) and Good Day Sunshine plus a cover that ranks among rock's best.Damn,this is a great album...and the best is yet to come...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I could only hope that Firefly has the same post-cancellation success and impact that a Gene Roddenberry series once had with John Q. Public.  I had enjoyed the Buffy and Angel shows for their wit and heart and humor. When I heard that Joss Whedon was about to release a sci-fi series with a western flair, I was very curious and excited.<br /><br />The good news is that Firefly lived up to my expectations.  Joss delivered with the same key elements that made Buffy and Angel so much fun to watch.  The characters all seemed to breathe and resonate, the stories were interesting, the f/x were believable...I grew to care for Mal, Jayne and the rest of the Serenity crew.  Then came the cancellation and thus a whole lotta woebegone looks on my face.  Then, thank the idiot box gods, the dvd came out.  And now I'm frothing at the mouth to see the cinematic version.  Hopefully, \\"Serenity\\" will spawn another Firefly t.v. series and will go on to \\"live long and prosper.\\"<br /><br />By the way, a shoutout to Spike and Faith.  I'd heard that Joss wasn't gonna do anything with the Buffy universe in the near future, but c'mon now...
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I'm a history teacher with a long-standing interest in portrayals the past in film. Some productions are OK (\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"), some are downright awful (\\"The Patriot\\"). THIS is magnificent. <br /> <br />Class conflict is not something American audiences like to deal with. In general we'd much rather pretend that everyone is middle class, now and in the past as well. Set in England,\\"North and South\\" is not only the best love story I've ever seen, but it is also an honest look at how industrialized nations have developed their prosperity on the backs of the least. This is not to say it is a bash-the-capitalist flick either; in one compelling scene an unemployed union man asks the mill owner for a job, saying he'll take lower wages if necessary to provide for his foster children. Thornton (mill owner) points out the union would be down on him like a ton of bricks if *he'd* suggested hiring him at a lower wage. There's a lot to think about, as well as a lot to break your heart over, in this film. <br /> <br />While not entirely true to Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel, the \\"creative license\\" portions of the adaptation are acceptable. The cast, costumes, and locations (including a historic working mill) are superb. Absolutely the best historic adaptation ever---and yes, now my favorite love story.
B000000H4V|5.0|Remember that \\"territory\\" video, dudes all covered in mud, close up camera shots of that weird eye tattoo that one of the dudes has? Man, back in 93' I was a senior in high school, obsessed with Headbangers Ball (which hadn't gone down the toilet yet), and this video was a fixture. The song kills, as does the rest of the record-chugga chugga tribal feast. The production is great, and anyone who appreciates \\"the riff\\" accompanied by some of the most \\"flavorful\\" and powerful drumming ever to be found on a thrash/metal record, look no further. This has aged remarkably well. A must.
B000AL730Y|5.0|I've been listening to this CD every day since it was released. My first impression was \\"great CD, I really like it, but perhaps a bit mellow and not poppy and commercial enough for the masses\\". Since my first hearing every song has grown on me immensely and I genuinely - without trying to hype it - think its the best CD Paul has done in 30+ years. If you favorite Macca albums are his first 3 (McCartney, Ram, Wild Life) then you will undoubtedly will LOVE this CD. If your favorite album is Band on the run then perhaps you might be disappointed because its a bit more mellow. I love all cuts but my favorite track is \\"hidden\\" track #14 which could have fit just as easily on either Sgt. Pepper or the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds. Listen to it and you'll see what I mean! There is not a single lame track on this album! Could this be Paul's new Sgt. Pepper masterpiece? Time will tell but I think there's a very good chance.
B00027JYLC|5.0|I can't believe most people haven't seen this great film!  Circus midget Hans is a normal guy inside (which includes falling in love with a woman out of his league). The \\"normal\\" trapeze lady & the strong man are not normal on the inside(they don't mind poisoning Hans to get his money). Hans' friends, a chorus of actual circus freaks, come to his rescue.  They are immortalized by great photography in this film (a la Diane Arbus). Best thing of all: double edged (even sick)humor in the film lets us know that these poor folks can laugh at themselves!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Lady in the Tramp is such a classic disney flick that the whole family can enjoy over and over again!!!!!! What is more to say about this movie is that its timeless and will always be a disney favorite like Cinderella and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Bambi so i think that this movie is suited well for the disney family and should be in any dvd collection!!!!!!
B0002UOK04|5.0|I picked this up expecting another Norther / Kalmah / Children of Bodom / Eternal Tears of Sorrow (which would have been fine)...  but my strong opinion is that Jari has completely transcended that genre.  Might as well lump Opeth into the death metal category.  If you're into technical/intelligent metal, you can't go wrong here.

B000AL730O|5.0|9/20/05 <br /> <br />I wrote a review of this the other day as well but decided to add to it. <br /> <br />The more I listen to this, the more I really like it. <br /> <br />I've read other comments here that make me wonder if the authors actually ever listened to the CD.  Comments such as \\"his voice is shot\\", which actually came from a positive, four-star review.  What?  His voice, while perhaps sounding a little older (hey, he isn't 25 anymore), sure as heck isn't \\"shot\\". <br /> <br />One comment about his voice.  No matter his age, I've always thought that Paul often has chosen to sing in a key that's too high and not in his best comfort level.  Sometimes, he sounds strained.  (Remember \\"So Bad\\" from \\"Pipes of Peace\\"?)  His low- and mid-range voice is so fantastic, I wish he'd stay there.  The good news about his growing older is that he's realizing that, like any 63-year old singer, he doesn't have as wide a range anymore.  The falsetto isn't used as much on this CD, and I think that's a good thing.  \\"Jenny Wren\\" is a pretty tune, but his does use a high key here, and I think singing it in a key more like \\"Blackbird\\" or \\"Little Willow\\" (\\"Flaming Pie\\") would have made it better. <br /> <br />The songs here just keep growing on me. <br /> <br />\\"This Never Happened Before\\" is one of his best ballads ever.  Terrific vocal, great heartfelt lyrics. <br /> <br />People write off \\"English Tea\\" as some lightweight tune.  Perhaps they just don't get it.  It similar in message if not in tempo to \\"Ballroom Dancing\\" on \\"Tug of War\\".  Both are commentaries on growing up and living in English society.   <br /> <br />Maybe it's just Americans that don't get it.  Sometimes we fail to realize that there's a world beyond our borders.  For example, on \\"She's Given Up Talking\\" on \\"Driving Rain\\", I read a lot of comments about a supposedly nonsensical, lightweight Paul lyric:  \\"She's given up talking, won't say a word.  Even in the classroom, not a dickey bird\\".  Comments were basically, \\"what the hell is a dickey bird?\\"  It's an english expression, meaning pretty much the opposite of \\"a little bird told me\\".  So Paul isn't out of his mind, he's drawing on his own culture. <br /> <br />\\"Too Much Rain\\" has really grown on me.  It starts off melancholy, but ends up with a positive, hopeful message.  Great song. <br /> <br />\\"Friends to Go\\" is too short, but gets better with each play.  Listen to the lyrics.   <br /> <br />There isn't a weak song here.  If you bought it and listened to it once, disappointed that Paul isn't putting out copies of Beatles and Wings hits, well, give it another chance and listen to the messages of the song.  Basically, grow up!  Paul has. <br /> <br />9/15/05 <br /> <br />First things first: <br /> <br />1.  Some critics bashed every early McCartney release simply because he wasn't a Beatle anymore.  He drew intense ire because he was the first to publicly announce what had been a fact for a number of months:  the group was finished. <br /> <br />2.  A lot of critics will praise any recording from any individual or group that invokes thoughts of the Beatles.  Yet this same praise is withheld from the one living human being who has the most right to sound like the Beatles, even when he does a rather \\"Beatle-esque\\" album.  Let's face it, some critics immediately begin to type, \\"Doesn't measure up to his Beatles work\\" before even listening to any new Sir Paul material.  The fact is, some of his solo work has been as good or better than anything the Beatles did together.  The Beatles broke up when they were all less than thirty years old and their work, great as it was, reflected it's times and it's authors' youth.  Paul has aged and matured; much of his solo work is still \\"The Beatles\\", grown up. <br /> <br />3.  Since this new album has gotten a lot of praise, much of Sir Paul's other solo work has taken a lot of criticism, even from The Knight himself.  Even Sir Paul's weakest albums always contained several great songs, even if there is some filler.  And the fact is, with his only releasing a new pop album of original material every four years or so, his \\"recent\\" efforts have been great throughout and for the most part, critics were kind.  But in the face of \\"Chaos\\", some of these critics seem to be revising downward their opinions of some of Sir Paul's more recent albums.  The fact is, four of his last five albums of original material did get by-and-large excellent reviews (\\"Flowers in the Dirt\\", \\"Flaming Pie\\", \\"Driving Rain\\", and \\"Chaos and Creation\\"; the exception was \\"Off the Ground\\"). <br /> <br />As for this album: <br /> <br />\\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" is just fantastic.  Certainly not a rock 'n roll album, but instead a thoughtful, introspective piece that sounds great at the first listen and gets better with each subsequent play. <br /> <br />Paul's voice seems to have defied time.  At 63, his is still one of the best voices in pop music.  His musicianship is amazing, and not just as the bass virtuoso he is.  He handles various guitars, wind instruments, and percussion flawlessly on these songs.  Godrich should be praised if for nothing else, dismissing Pauls [outstanding] touring band, which produced the intensely personal sound of this record. <br /> <br />Has there ever been a more talented singer/songwriter/musician in the pop era? <br /> <br />This one is a classic.  Put it on the shelf next to \\"Abbey Road\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", \\"Band on the Run\\", \\"Tug of War\\", and \\"Flaming Pie\\". <br />
B000AADYRQ|4.0|I just picked this up the other day after day-after-day of getting phone calls from my dear friend - who just loves em to death! (no pun intended) - nagging me to GET IT!! And I will have to admit that I truely love it! And for anyone who has seen my first incarnation of my review, I now love EVERY song!    This album is full of pop-oriented, very catchy and dreamy tunes cleverly assembled with accoustic & electric gutars, piano, accoustic drums, subtle synths, beat-box, vocals, harmonicas, post production tricks and, of course, harpischords. The vocals, in typical DCFC fashion, are simple, yet complex. Incorporating common, fun, and quirky everyday things - like Greyhound stations, freckles, ICU, 409 (cleaner) and willow trees - into the lyrics while at the same time, making a profound statement... it's music for thinking people.    At first impression, I would sum up saying this is two-parts Transatlanticism, mixed with one-parts Postal Service (Gibbard's sideline efforts with Jimmy Tamborello). But now that I've listened to it numerous times, I think it can stand up on it's own, ...better than Transatlanticism and Postal Service put together in fact.    Recommended highly!! (and not just because I'm a Northwester) :)    update:  5 STARS ACTUALLY! Plans has found it's way in my purport \\"Top 10 List of All Time\\" (which probably consists of 100+ top 10's).

B00000JMOJ|4.0|The year is 2017. America is ruled by a brutal police state. The government owns the media and lies to the public through it. Music, movies and any another art form is censored. America's favorite television show: Running Man. A game show where convicted murderers and menaces to society fight it out in a Gladiator style battle to the death against \\"Stalkers\\" for a chance to win prizes like a trial by jury or an acquittal. Based on a short novel by Stephen King's pseudonym Richard Bachman, 1987's The Running Man should be an entertaining movie, which it is, but should also be a reminder of how grateful we should be to live in a free society. The problem is that it doesn't. It's more of a grim prediction which isn't too hard to imagine in 12 years with the way things are going. With America's desensitized obsession with violence and knack for reality tv, it isn't hard to see the two being combined in the years to come as our morale continues to decay. Just last month there was a swat raid on a perfectly legal electronic music event near Salt Lake City, Utah where police used excessive force at a peaceful gathering. Police also used excessive force just recently at the annual Punk Rock Picnic in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Even after that, the site musicisnotacrime org posted information about police brutality at the event and their site was attacked and shut down by excessive downloading and bandwidth drainage where the IP number addressed back the Kenosha police's website. The police obviously wanted the site silenced and the Freedom of Speech held no concern. And let's not all forget about the Patriot Act or the Rave Act. Are the ideas in The Running Man far from the way things are today? Sadly to say, they are not.<br />Enough ranting, The Running Man is a great movie and can still hold my attention after all these years. One of Arnold's best for sure. That's it for me.
B0002V7O3S|5.0|And that's okay with me because no I haven't read the book but I know the real Travis Walton says that he saw human like creatures and aliens on the ship and that he actually scared them and they ran away from him. To me that's not really scary, I mean I believe it happened to him. I've always believed we aren't alone in the universe. And maybe some aliens are nice and curious creatures but who says there is only one species? I think that's what the director wanted to do with Fire. Close Encounters of the Third kind potray aliens as friendly, and while that's a good movie what is more entertaining? Watching aliens giving a tour or watching aliens perform painful experiments? At least everyone I know that's seen this film were freaked out by it. I remember watching Fire when I was eleven and it scared me for weeks. I'm 22 now and I recently just bought it on DVD and the end sequence still freaked me out. It is well directed and acted. And I think it is possible that Travis would return alive if what happened in the film really did happen to him. The aliens never try to kill him, they are experimenting on another species. We would do the same to an alien if it was found on Earth right? So don't be hypocrites. An amazing movie.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|As good as this DVD is on a home theater it's a damn shame I never went to this festival of guitar greats to see it live.   I don't have the time it would take to critique the many talented acts on this two disk collection.   I'll just say that if you want to hear the bands and players that Eric Clapton rates as the best of the best, then take this home and crank it up.  You wont be disappointed.  In fact I think you just might find yourself envious of those who were able to catch this great festival live.
B000AA305M|1.0|I just recieved this CD from Amazon and immediately put it into my computer so that I could put it on my new Ipod. Well it turns out that this CD is not compatable with Ipod. When you first put it into your computer you have to read and agree with a huge licensing agreement, then it lists all the things that you can and can't do with the CD that you bought and now own but can't do anything with. They will allow you to make up to three copies of it and then it apparently will self destruct like on Mission Impossible. If this is the future of CDs I will have no part of it. I'm returning it tomorrow.
0517220784|5.0|I read all the Sherlock Holmes stories when I was a young teen.  It was great fun then, and I still enjoy reading things like how Watson discovers Holmes is unaware that the earth goes about the sun.  Holmes says the knowledge is useless to him, and he will endevor to forget it, and he likens the mind to an attic wherein, upon reaching some fullness, something must be removed if something else is to be added.  And the relative values of the items must be evaluated.  The collection would be a nice gift instead of another video game or DVD.
B0009X766Y|5.0|...I am a cinematography purist.  I'm giving it 5 stars anyway, because this film is that good!<br /><br />The 1998 DVD release of \\"The Sting\\" was not a \\"pan-and-scan\\" treatment -- as incorrectly stated (still!) in the amazon.com listing for it -- but the whole, uncut film image, presented as intended by the director and cinematographer.  George Roy Hill and Robert Surtees shot it as a 1.33:1 (4:3) film, and intended it to be seen in theaters that way.  But the studio chickened out, thinking that people wouldn't want to see a 1.33:1 film 19 years after widescreen revolutionized the moviegoing experience in 1954, so they matted it into 1.85:1 widescreen and altered the cinematographer's craft and the director's intent.  Not good!<br /><br />I used to call myself a \\"widescreen fan,\\" but what I have really always been is a \\"cinematography purist,\\" or an \\"as the director intended\\" fan of filmed images.  Virtually all \\"widescreen fans\\" of home video releases really are \\"cinematography purists\\" like me.  Embrace yourself and your label, and embrace 4:3 if a film called for it!<br /><br />Many 1.85:1 widescreen films are shot in 4:3, with the full intention by the director and cinematographer to matte them into 1.85:1 format for theatrical release.  So they shoot scenes accordingly, not worrying too much about the very top and very bottom of the images in the camera eye, because they will be matted away.  What is different here is that \\"The Sting\\" was meant to remain a 4:3 film in the theaters, and so was shot accordingly, with Surtees' full use of the 4:3 frame.  If you matte it, you lose parts of the intended images, which detracts from the overall experience, and for some films this means ruin.<br /><br />If you are a film fan, you want to see what the director intended you to see, don't you?  All Universal had to do was explain on the back of the DVD box that the film is presented as the director and cinematographer wanted it shown.  This makes us purists happy, and also happens to please the dwindling number of people who hate black bars at the top and bottom of the screen -- with all the TV shows and commercials done in widescreen these days, they are getting used to it!<br /><br />All studios should explain director intent in a small paragraph on their video boxes, so that we who are not film historians can discover whether any particular full-screen DVD release is a pre-widescreen film, a horrible \\"pan-and-scan\\" butchery, or a 4:3 oddity in the widescreen world. (FYI, many films from the mid- to late-1950s were meant to be 4:3, because although widescreen films existed and wowed audiences from late 1953, it took some time for the studios and their theaters to convert over to [virtually] all widescreen releases.)<br /><br />I wrote to Universal to ask them to provide this restored print edition in a 4:3 full-screen, un-matted release, but sadly they have no plans to do so.  I guess I'll have to be content to remain faithful to my old copy until they see the light.<br /><br />So I suppose there are now some widescreen TV junkies out there who hate all 4:3 films and TV shows because of the black bars at the left and right of the screen....ndling number of people who hate black bars at the top and bottom of the screen -- with all the TV shows and commercials done in widescreen these days, they are getting used to it!

B000002MP2|4.0|I'm not a big Green Day fan, in fact I can't stand their newest album, however, I really like this one.  Filled with Classic and solid 90s rock, this album lends a unique sound and will be liked by fan of the band and genre.
