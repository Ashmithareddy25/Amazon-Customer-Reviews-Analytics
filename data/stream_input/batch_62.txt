B000VDDWDS|3|The audio was great and this is well filmed and acted picture but the video quality on the Blu-ray version was disappointing.  Thumbs down on this transfer.  I've seen movies over 20 years old look much better than this one.  Lonesome Dove looks about 3x the resolution.
B00FPOSDGY|3|This book was okay. It did have some twists and turns to maintain interest but the writing style was confusing. I read a ton of books and this one was not a page turner in that I could have put it down and forgot about it. Although I didn't. I did finish the book but was never enthralled or sympathetic with the main character.
B0054PSY2W|5|I just Love this Movie.
B00AREIAI8|5|This game is awesome. I love animals. This game totally met my expectations. l recommend this game for everyone. Awesome!!!
B006VREHRS|5|Clever
B0089EHWQE|5|very moving.i liked it very much.
B00AIBZMD6|4|Good spy film and looking forward to seeing another story line in the future.
B00004S6GL|5|A lot of fans like to dog this album.  I have a theory for why this is.<br />It's not that the album is bad, at all, but that it's not the Elliott that THEY want Elliott to be.  They fell in love with the man behind either/or, or the self-titled, or (gasp) the barely audible Roman Candle.  They swoon for the quietness, the starkness, the nakedness, bitterness, intimacy.  They think &quot;hi-fi&quot; is a four-letter word, not to mention &quot;production&quot;, and dare I even say it, &quot;pop.&quot;<br />They were willing to accept XO as a temporary stray from the purity of their vision for his career.  In their forgiving state of mind, the music was able to seep into their brains and they saw its brilliance.  Hence, XO = good.  And, surely Elliott will get back on track next time.<br />Figure 8 comes along and dashes their hopes.  Their beloved tortured soulmate actually knows his way around modern expensive studio technology - AND HE LIKES IT!!!  Traitor!<br />Man, I love E.S. and E/O as much as anyone.  Love em.  Love em love em love em.  But I'm one of those who believe that Elliott broke through into an altogether new plane of genius with XO.  And Figure 8 is absolutely a worthy continuation of the path he was on.<br />Put it this way - if I'm taking ten to the desert island, XO is in the bag for sure.  Figure 8 will be really, really hard to leave out.  The others, I'll miss a hell of a lot.
0689835604|4|Bright, sturdy and baby loves lifting the flaps up to see what is beneath them! I would purchase more of Karen Katz books because the quality id great and the fun bright colors captivates baby's attention.
B008VBYN80|5|Great for playing in between classes at school since I tend to have around twenty minutes in between. Not too focus intensive, so I don't need to pay a whole lot of attention to what I'm doing.
0385507755|1|i quit reading this book, when the author began to describe having his teeth worked on, early in recovery, without analgesia.  this would never have happened for a number of reasons.  this lowered the author's general credibility to near zero.  fortunately, i was able to get my money back.
0345803493|5|My wife and her friends have read the first book.
B000006YXV|5|I listen to this CD from the first song through to the last song.  I usually skip around and not listen all of them on most CD's that are &#34;best of&#34;.  The Very Best of Marvin Gaye, is definitely the best &#34;best of&#34; albums by anyone.
B00005QK3W|1|I've got all his albums and this is by far the worst dribble I've ever heard!  I'm so disappointed in this I can't stand it.  This is as bad as Flaming Pie was good.  Mr. McCartney, if this is the best you can do at this point in your career, give up, go back to the farm, and don't keep teasing us with you on again/off again attempts at producing consistantly &quot;good&quot; albums.  Honestly, there's not one good song on the album.
B005ZO6DIO|5|I love SOA but I am disappointed to see Piney die the way he did. I am so tired of Clay. I hope the rest of the sons put him in front of a firing squad. I am looking forward to seeing how Kurt Sutter has the future planned. I don't like some of the decisions he's made but the story is riveting nonetheless.
B00C7JG0KG|5|Pay no attention to those people behind the curtain claiming that this film does an injustice to the work of L. Frank Baum.  They are of no consequence.<br /><br />Great stories often tell of a personal transformation, and I loved the transition from Oz the scoundrel to Oz the leader.  Franco played the scoundrel Oz quite well, I thought, and I believed he was still the scoundrel right up to the point that he proved he wasn't.<br /><br />I went into this movie with a great sense of trepidation caused by a legion of bad reviews, and one again I loved a thoroughly panned film.  I was able to sit through the entire sequence twice (once in 2D and once again in 3D) without once trying to figure out why this take on Baum's Oz was less effective than the 1939 one, which I also love dearly.  I did, however, greatly enjoy identifying the connections between this obvious prequel and the 1939 classic.<br /><br />If you can go into this feature without preconceived notions of Oz that you insist it live up to, you may have an enjoyable experience, as I did.
B00FAX6XQC|5|Its just like real life but gives you time to shoot
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is an awesome game for kids and I love it.the game is so much like temple run accept without the little monsters following you.you have a security guard and his dog.I love it and I will continue to play intolerant it gets old.
B001KVZ6HK|5|Great movie!  Very impressed with how well the pulled such a big movie off with some many big stars.  Can't wait for #2!
B007SYWFRM|5|This game is addictive.. really enjoy the animation. This most recent update fixed all the issues that I have run across.
B000023VR6|5|Dr. Dre had an amazing career. He was in N.W.A., he invented G Funk, he discovered Snoop, Em, Hittman and many others but he's also keep doing classic solo albums. 2001 is one of them (along with Chronic).2001 is full of featurings with Dre's old (Snoop, Kurupt, Nate) and some new friends like Eminem, Xzibit and Hittman. Dre is producing this album with his magical beats with a little help of Mel-men and Finnesse (who is producing a surprise duet with Mary J. Blige on The Message). Album starts with my favorite song on the album: The Watcher. First really solo song from Dre and with an amazing beat. Goes on with the funny F*** You with Snoop and The Dude talking about which kind of a b*** they like f* with. I will stop here, but I recommend you to buy it because it is great and certainly a lot better choice than any 50 Cent or P. Diddy out there.
1416987118|5|This book encourages early readers through repetition and the story is excellent.  Great book.  One of my 5year old's favorite books.
B00005R87Q|5|Hiya, I would just like to say that this offer is great! The film is even better with great graphics and music this beats every action film there is. Within me being a girl it's very good!
B00A757EFW|3|It's not that good but not great. Personally I think it's a 3 star game. To be honest the controls aren't that good.
B00GG4E6XG|4|I am very happy to see the missing soundtrack albums not otherwise available such as: It Happened At The World's Fair, Kissin' Cousins, Harum Scarum, Spinout, Double Trouble, and Speedway.<br /><br />Still missing are: EPs not included are Love Me Tender, Tickle Me (and Tickle Me vol 2 if you count the UK release) and Easy Come-Easy Go. Other soundtracks not included: Wild In The Country, Live A Little-Love A Little, Stay Away Joe, Charro, The Trouble With Girls and Change Of Habit. So at least one star has to be deducted.  Hey, they even included the distortion on Blue River as originally released, as well as the brief dropout on the left channel of You Don't Me. Other defective artifacts are intact here and there. Now that is historic accuracy at its finest!
B00992CF6W|1|I agree where's the update I keen cant they at least make an update I want to now how to light tnt
B00FEQ3VFG|1|Terrible product. Purchased this for valentines day for my daughter (who is VERY good with her toys). Within 24 hours, Anna's feet broke off and Olaf lost an arm.  They' were two of her favorites and she was so upset. Cheaply made and I would not suggest buying this &#34;play set&#34;.
B005CRQ4GU|5|I choose five star rating because this is one of my favorite authors and my favorite book by him.<br />- kleanne
B005K17RU0|1|Despite trying what others described, I cannot get this to run properly on my Fire.  All it wants to do is show some location in PA (I'm in GA).  It looks nice but for me is non-functional.
B00I2TW0UO|5|This was a great continuation of this great.  Certainly the story line doesn't slow down at all!  This movie's ending took me by surprise.  Looking forward in where this all ends.
B00HHYEOY0|4|Great item!!
B0064MGU98|4|I am hooked!
B0025VLELQ|5|I have loved this movie since it came out years and years ago.  And Catherine Mary Stewart looked so hot in this film.  I have always wished a part two would come out of some sort.
0374203032|5|I checked this book out of the library. I appreciated it so much that I'm buying a copy so I can read it again, underline and write notes all over it. It contains a wealth of fascinating facts and insights about them. It is also wonderfully readable. I disagree with some commenters who think it is too limited in scope. It focuses on a very specific topic and is quite thorough in exploring it.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Incredible book! Loved it
B007IXWKUK|5|The fights, the development of trust, the typical stressors, the insatiable lust are all well done and quite typical of people who are in that kind of lust / love relationship.  An excellent read!  Couldn't put the book down!  Much better than book 1!
B00DJFIMW6|4|I enjoy these running games like temple run and what not. My big issue with this game is that the sliding mechanics of your finger and the mission's movement can get jumbled; for example when I'm trying to move left or right and it'll interpret it and a roll/slide.
B00L9B7IKE|3|Good read. Keeps you guessing.
B00B78AIV0|5|I am a fan of Ms. Adichie, having read 'Half A Yellow Sun' a few years ago. 'Americanah' is next.
6304466498|4|SPACEBALLS was perhaps the last of Mel Brooks' really funny spoof movies. Following from the classic BLAZING SADDLES Western parody, SPACEBALLS takes in all and every science fiction movie, breaking every rule and recycling  every cliche for maximum comic effect.<br />No sci-fi movie is safe: STAR WARS  is the biggest casualty, with plenty of laugh-out-loud references (Pizza  the Hutt and Dark Helmet being just two of many). The plot loses it way to  the insane jokes, much like many of Mel Brooks' movies, but that really  doesn't matter. You'll be laughing too hard to notice.<br />Obviously this  isn't going to appeal to everyone just as science-fiction doesn't appeal to  everyone. However, if you're prepared for a riotous, zany cast (Rick  Moranis as Dark Helmet brings pathetic bad guys to a new level) armed with  a funny script, then SPACEBALLS is for you.
B00J3AW23G|5|Addictive game but gaining skills in your thinking into resolving the level to next level. It gets a bit more of giving you skills into toughest levels and pat on your back with pride that I DID IT each time in each level! :-D &#60;3
B00026WU82|5|just buy it. it is worth it. the first song is worth the cost of the entire album. you almost forget to listen the rest cause you just keep repeating the first song. then you hear the rest and you just have to sit down or pull off to the side of the road so you can reclaim your mind.
B000ID37KO|4|a colorized version of a timeless classic Hitchcock movie!!! Very well done.  I love this movie every time I see it!
0553274503|5|This intriguing book about human intelligence and its manipulation shows the problems of changing nature's gifts. By reading it you'll find the keys to friendship and self-esteem between individuals that think quite  differently. It was very exciting and convincing. You'll cry reading it and  won't put it down. The end makes you want to read it again. I would  recommend it to everybody.
B006GWO5NE|5|Nice USB
B007L6VR12|5|I loved this movie when I saw it in theatres, so I bought it on DVD right away. It is a wonderful film. Wes Anderson is a great director and the acting is very believable. I made my whole family watch it and they all loved it -- even my grumpy grandfather!
B00CS74W0C|1|I enjoyed the first two books in this series.  Nothing earth shattering, but an enjoyable, casual read..  I also bought the audible versions so I could listen on the go.  Got to the 3rd book and ... it isn't complete - I mean, it just ... stops.  So basically, you get 2 stories that are pretty decent then a longish series of chapters with an author's note at the end that there is more to come (after you shell out more $$ of course.)  If you want resolutions to a number of plot lines, you have buy book 4.  There doesn't seem to be an expected date for that installment.<br />I expect, at this price ($23 + audio), to find a beginning, middle and end to EACH book, not a bait and switch for the next installment.  This made me so mad that I returned the book to Amazon - which I have never done before. I say steer clear - very poorly done.
B00L9B7IKE|4|This author, from my experience, knows firsthand about alcoholism and all of its terrible manifestations. Cheating, lying and most telling, self deceit. Creepy feelings and memories - reading this story - I could not put it down and it makes my skin crawl at the same time. WELL DONE.  I am a voracious reader but I cannot recall another novel which so accurately describes the personal feelings of blackout, self incrimination, etc etc etc.  \\"Constitutionally incapable of being honest with ourselves\\" I.e. We lie to ourselves about ourselves and we believe it\\".
B001GXF2YY|4|Fast pace with good character development .Believable and interesting to the end. As with all Harry Bosch novels one can feel the grittness of the JOB.
B0043JDUNS|5|I really liked this movie, it's actiony yet funny and Robert Downey jr. is like the best ever. He makes the movie!
1401223176|5|Totally rocks seeing  all the Batman heroes plus Superman and villains. Kick ass book. This is coming from a female DC lover fan!
B007N85POS|5|They are kinda angry
B00IIUATDM|5|Leonardo DiCaprio just the best
1584233494|5|Bought this for my nephew's 17th birthday.  Great quality book and love Shepard's artwork so a win win!  If you have an art lover with a social conscience in your life, this is a good book to gift.  Highly recommend.
B00KWVZ750|5|Awesome . Best angry birds game ever
B007BVMVDU|5|Great series! One of the best that ever came from HBO Studios. Very engaging and worthy of any awards given.
B00V4JKT52|2|Didn't do the cast justice. Songs were not memorable and stories were seen together like Frankenstein. Only gave 2 stars because the cast was naturally awesome.
B0094BB4TW|5|Socialize with all your friends & family by sharing pictures,  jokes, events, & updates with a tap of your finger.
B007LE2VDM|5|not much to say other than this is what I wanted.  download went smoothly. I don't have 6 more words!
0316044407|5|You will not be disappointed that you bought this book.  The writing is so well done that the subject matter becomes more palatable.  Her language is clear and unconvoluted, yet extremely full of thought. Making the protagonist the narrator, is not unusual, but from where the narration takes place, gives the writer the proper vehicle to tell her story. A good read, is a good read.  A good writer is a good writer, and Alice Sebold is a GOOD writer.
B0000029DD|5|Jeff Buckley has inspired me both musically and on a personal level. He was a beautiful man, uniquely talented and a voice that many have tried to emulate but NO ONE has ever come close to beating.<br />When I first heard the song &quot;Grace&quot; I was simply blown away, I could not believe that music that beautiful and a voice so expansive could ever exist. There is so much to enjoy on this album and I would be doing an injustice to Jeff's masterpiece by choosing a &quot;best&quot; song as their simply isn't one. You must listen to the album as a whole.<br />It saddens me to think that Jeff died never knowing how popular he was to become, real artists mention Jeff among their favourite artists and influences.<br />In a way though, I feel priviliged that I have been able to hear something so beautiful. Jeff's memory among his fans will live on forever, and his music is timeless.<br />By way of a footnote, if &quot;Grace&quot; has inspired you as much as it has me then please check out &quot;My Sweetheart the Drunk&quot; which is a collection songs he recorded before he died which may, or may not, have ended up on his next album.
1490313370|5|Drawing on the work of Seth Godin and others on how the Internet, the decline in real wages, rising income equality, and tons of other economic trends are ushering out the old industrial-corporate system in favor of a new connection economy, Altucher comprehensively explores what it means to choose oneself for financial and psychological success this new kind of world, using copious and vivid examples from his own riches-to-rags-to-riches story.<br /><br />Getting a job is dead. The middle class is dead. In the near future, says Altucher, you'll either be a temp staffer or an entrepreneur -- one or the other. There's nothing wrong with staffing, and we'll always need people to do it, but to Altucher, everyone is capable of choosing themselves to create value in the world.<br /><br />It starts with what Altucher calls &#34;The Daily Practice,&#34; which is his way of keeping the four bodies healthy: the physical, the emotional, the mental, and the spiritual. His go-to metaphor for this is the strong and well-appointed house that, no matter how fancy it looks inside and out, requires a sturdy foundation at its base. Any success as an entrepreneur similar requires a baseline level of health across the aforementioned four spectrums. Altucher illustrates how he does it, from writing down ten new ideas every day (to become an &#34;idea machine&#34;), to relentlessly surrounding yourself only with people you love and who love you.<br /><br />Altucher anticipates your natural recoil from these ideas by illustrating his own fears -- of rejection, of loneliness, of inadequacy, and plenty more -- and how he's been able to alleviate them. We're talking about a guy who boldly and blatantly states that he refused his father's death-bed reconciliation attempt, and that his mother now blames him for the death. As he says about his blog, Altucher has &#34;turned himself inside out and his guts have ended up all over.&#34; And that's exactly what you'll find throughout this book; only it's not just a bunch of spilled viscera, it's a meticulously-arranged set of lessons that we can all learn something from.<br /><br />Once he's made clear the importance of health, Altucher gets into the details of how he's started 20 business, several of which have been successful, and published 11 books, run hedge funds, etc. etc., all without waiting for some gatekeeper to shepherd him through to the promised land. (And there are other cases, like Alex Day, Gandhi, Woody Allen, Bill Gates, and others). You learn the virtues of cold calling, giving away ideas to others, connecting the people in your network to each other, and doing only what sets your body on fire.<br /><br />It's by no means an easy road, a fact Altucher maybe undersells. It takes a lot of hard work to carve out your space in the world among the dying corporate giants. But it's possible, and in the end, that's the most important thing to learn.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Oh my this was  a great read. Well done, fast paced and a big surprise. Loved it and all of its intriguing characters.
B002QE3CTY|3|Mostly predicatable
B00000K19E|5|this is great.  No more to be said.
B00VMQK37Q|4|Hes great as always!
B00DPM7TIG|5|A riveting story of the bravery & resourcefulness of a young blind girl during the German occupation of France during WW II.  A page turner!
B0063IH60K|5|I love this game!
1439102732|2|I thought this was better than some of her more recent books, such as \\"Home Rules\\" and that one about the girl with osteogenesis imperfecta (though perhaps this was because I was trapped on a flight without other reading matter), but it was still flawed by stereotypical characters and, of course, the requisite trial with the requisite surprising ending. I thought Zoe, while not a bad character, was unbelievable in a number of ways -- thinking that at 28 weeks her pregnancy was basically a done deal (most women with a past history of miscarriages and infertility tend to not relax at all til the baby's born, or at least until 32 weeks), and not expecting that Max would be fine and dandy with the idea of giving them rights to the embryos. Still, I keep on reading even though I'm disappointed, so that says something about Picoult's talents.
B00013F38K|5|Awesome! I don't know what the big fuss is about the cropping. It's better than the original.
B00AREIAI8|5|It really is a nice app that just is relaxing. It teaches you the basic then leaves you to become a master with your horse.
B00846REIS|4|Let me say that I did not read Fifty Shades of Grey. I think I read a twilight fanfiction that's like it, but, judging from the number of negative reviews on Amazon, I didn't want to touch that series just yet (#neg reviews almost equal to the # of positives). I heard that this series reminded people of Fifty Shades of Grey, but the rating is better for this one, so I gave in. I bought the kindle edition and finished it 2 days later (on vacation, lots of time).<br /><br />Both of the main characters, Eva and Gideon, have harsh pasts. Both have been in someways sexually abused, but it is curious to me that their relationship is intensely sexual in nature. And it seems that they needed it to be that way. Gideon have control issue: he needs to be in control of everything. His principle is to separate business from pleasure. Eva, in contrast, craves affection and a sincere and open relationship. That's the crux of the problem. Their chemistry is over the world. It's intense and all-consuming, but Eva doesn't want a purely sexual relationship because she would feel like she was being used (trauma). Their desire for each other brought them together despite all warnings ringing through their minds that they might not be good for each other. Explosive relationship ensures. Sex is great, but emotionally, they are fraying at the edges. The story is about them trying to overcome their past, not let it win over them and destroy what they have. The first volume ended with the emergence of a love rival. There are still a lot of things left unsolved (whatever, it's a trilogy anyways).<br /><br />The sex was okay-good, but repetitive. After a while, there's just *so much* sex--I think there was a point that you can't turn a page without reading about Eva moaning--that I started to skim those parts. However, I understand that this is an erotic novel and sex is pretty much a requirement as it is integral to the character development in general. It's kind of weird because I think because they spent 80% of the book having sex, they are not really talking about themselves or get to know each other. Their relationship moved super fast--over the space of a week or so and they were already pretty much living together, with their own drawers at each other's apartment and all. What little they know about each other's past or characters are from other people or from Wikipedia or from private investigation. It's strange. As I write this, I question myself if that's really a problem; probably not, it's fiction and not supposed to reflect exactly what actually happens in real life.<br /><br />I think some people have commented of Gideon's need for control being borderline stalkerish or just stalkerish and creepy. I agree with that assessment. It's just not normal for someone to be that much of a control freak. I would freak out if someone pursues me that aggressively and try to control who I can and can't talk to. Though, given his past (vague) I could maybe understand why he turned out that way. And if I'm as self conscious as Eva is, I would probably be flattered that someone as worldly/handsome/sexy/etc.etc. like Gideon Cross would be so interested in me. It's glossed over, but their relationship is a Dom/Sub one. At one point, Gideon admitted that he is a Dominant and tried to convince Eva that she is obviously a Submissive. It's a pretty mild Dom/Sub, though. With no BDSM. I think later books might explore that a bit more. Anyways, the whole thing about Gideon's need for control and possessiveness -- it really depends on the reader, I think. It depends on what flavor sex life the reader prefer. There are quite a few people who don't like others to control their lives in anyway and thought that Gideon's need for control as \\"creepy\\" or \\"stalkerish.\\" However, there are probably others out there who like a little possessiveness in their relationship (or a lot in Gideon's case). Dominancy in a relationship *can* be sexy. But it all depends on how much people can take/define dominancy. So don't be too taken-aback by some of the comments and let those drive you away. It's about fantasy and how you connect with it as much as it is about literary stuff like grammar and character development.<br /><br />The writing is okay. Nothing to brag about. Though, as I said before, some descriptions are repetitive. Especially during sex. Also I can't count how many times Eva remarked on how sexy Gideon looks.<br /><br />If reading all these reviews didn't help you, then go read an excerpt from the book. I think there's one on Sylvia's homepage.
B00AREIAI8|4|Lots of fun very addicting my grandkids will love it . I have been playing for hours need to stop so I can clean house.
B005IQZB14|2|Mostly a &#34;brag book&#34; about how Ms. Strayed went for a hike....in doing so, she toned her body, kicked a drug habit all framed in the story of  very stupid and dangerous decisions throughout (promiscuity, dumping her forgiving husband,overloading her backpack, hitchhiking, an abortion, with needless and graphic descriptions of her mangled toenails, ....blah blah, blah). Everything justified by the unfortunate loss of her mother.  I started to give this book three stars, but thought about how deeply self-indulgent Ms. Strayed was for writing the tale and the ill gotten gains that resulted from it.
B0038QGXHW|5|Love this CD on my first listen. Two greats interacting on a level that only years of experience can produce. Very laid back vibe. Jarrett does some of his \\"talking\\" while playing but that is not as obnoxious as other times.<br /><br />Give this one a go!
B003Y5HWJU|5|After &#34;The Wire,&#34; this is by far the best show on television! Non-stop action, interesting characters and an ever evolving storyline. If you have not watched Boardwalk Empire, you are missing quite a treat!
B00C8S9W0G|5|What can I say?  If you are looking at a review of this book then you already know Ms. Gabaldon and her writing.  She doesn't disappoint!  She does, however, leave the reader hanging mercilessly at the end.  Not nice!
0553801473|5|Excellent.
B009C7JS14|5|Quick and gives you all the information.
B007JUWM64|2|An original movie classic trying to be updated but falling far short. The flying ships belong in a comedy and they turned this classic into a ship of fools instead of adding more clearity and better film coverage. Amazon is as always great, but this movie was a flop.
1250038820|5|Wonderful book. A perfect gift for anyone interested in the human culture. Small stories about most pictures and how they came to fruition.
B007FG9LIE|3|Interesting science fiction ideas and pretty good yarn. Too James Bond like in the hero always coming out on top, seemingly just because he's the hero.
B0036MDNN0|5|very unique dinosaur very interesting.
B009ZXT4BY|1|you should not get this game because it gives you 10 minuets to play it is so stupid DO NOT GET THIS APP
0694003611|5|My niece is two and I have a feeling that we read it so often that she can recite it word for word.  If you get tired of reading the passages you can always say good night rug, good night lamp.  My niece reads it and says \\"good night hushing lady.\\"  Again she is two and now can read it to us.  Its a book that gives back.
B000H0MKGK|5|This CD is a little more bluesy with a little bit of soul than the first one but John Mayer's music is still the best of any new artist ever.  You will love it!
B003ZSJ212|5|If you are a serious--no I mean SERIOUS Star Wars fan, then you would probably want this now<br />out of print Blu Ray collection.  See the problem is, George Lucas has this peculiar idea that<br />the films are HIS, not the fan base's films!  Which means, every time a new format comes out,<br />he changes stuff.  [See &#34;The People vs. George Lucas].  The most outrageous was the scene<br />in the very first film &#34;Star Wars&#34;, in which Luke and Obe Wan Kenobi meet Han Solo and the<br />Wookie at the space port.  A bounty hunter was also looking for Solo.  In the original theatrical<br />version, and the VHS tape version, Solo shoots the bounty hunter from under his table at the<br />bar.  When it was revised for Blu-Ray, Lucas tinkered with it and had the bounty hunter shoot<br />(slightly) first yet, incredibly, MISS from about 3 feet away!  Why is this important?<br /><br />Well, in the original version Han Solo's character starts out completely self-interested.  He is<br />not interested in the laws or in anyone else, just making good money.  He had no problem<br />with shooting a bounty hunter who was looking for him.  In the re-make, Lucas seemed to<br />decide to make it more &#34;kid&#34; (or teen?) friendly with the artifice that the bounty hunter shot<br />first (though Solo's shot follows so closely after that he would have had to intend it ANYHOW).<br /><br />This version is out of print but includes an original (DVD) version that still shows the movie as<br />it appeared in theatres.  You won't find that in more modern versions.  It's still an epic series<br />(though Lucas himself is best with special effects, not so much at directing actors nor at<br />script writing--sorry George--I know you are wealthy enough that you shouldn't care).  The<br />series will remain in film history.
B004QKNXIQ|4|The story-line and music was great.  And most of all, I liked the &#34;old-school&#34; pre-Pixar Disney characters.  This  film will be enjoyed by families and Disney-lovers.
B003G4W49C|4|Compelling story line with good character development. A must read for all serious sci-fi fans. Also recommend reading Ender's Shadow
B005ZOBNOI|5|Loved the book.  Could not put it down.
B0067RQYNW|4|Although I just recently downloaded Kingsoft Office onto my Kindle Fire, it appears to be just what I wanted. We use a spreadsheet to track financial information. When we travel, we usually bring along a laptop. We are hoping to lighten our load by using the Kindle Fire. So we're experimenting prior to taking our Christmas journey.<br /><br />I attached an Excel spreadsheet to an email, (using Windows Live Mail) and sent it to myself. I used the Fire to open the email, then copied the file to the Kingsoft Office app and opened it. All was OK, Even the columns on the spreadsheet copied/pasted just as they were.<br /><br />I haven't gotten into the complexities of working with this software. However the few experiments I tried have me feeling that this Kingsoft Office will be user  friendly.
B00Q7WBFTA|4|this review is made on the blu ray disc of the movie, as follows-<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video - 4 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br /><br />only recommended if you are into full singing scripts.<br />video was ok with a somewhat bleached color pallette.<br />audio however was great.<br />different take on several fairy tales all rolled into one.
B00EEDJHXA|5|Really glad I downloaded. Challenging and unique puzzler with interesting sound effects that are fun rather than annoying or obnoxious. Each new level more fun than the last, and truly full version without annoying ads. Well done, devs!
B003JTHESA|3|When I first heard The Final Frontier and saw the video on Iron Maiden's website, I became overly excited thinking this was going to be the best Iron Maiden CD in a while.  Let me just throw this out quick by saying this is my opinion.  I want to make sure people understand, especially ORWarrior, that this is not a troll post.  Just because this music does not suit \\"MY\\" taste, it does not mean it is horrid garbage for everyone else, this one just wasn't for me.  I've given it several listens and each time I find the same thing.  After several complete listens, I now find myself getting more and more bored with the slower intro style songs, and personally, I think there are too many of them on here, or maybe it's just that so many of the songs take so long to really get going that I lose interest.  I think Seventh Son had a nice entry with Infinite Dreams, but the entire disc didn't have the same feel.  So I don't hate all their slower stuff, but they can definitely keep stuff like Wasting Love and Journeyman.  I know Maiden does great epics, and I'm not looking for the days of the old.  I know what I like about Maiden and it's usually faster material.    My first gripe with the songs is the 4+ minute droaning on of Satellite 15.  Really guys?  4 minutes of almost the same thing?  I find myself fast fowarding to about 3 minutes and then resuming.  After that, I love it, great opener.  It gave me goosebumps that I haven't felt since the first time I heard Wicker Man. (which I absolutely love!)  It's after that where I become disappointed with the rest of this disc.  While I love the songs that open like Fear of the Dark and Hallowed Be Thy Name, I didn't care for the way they did it with the songs on here.  I understand they tried something different, It just didn't strike the right chord for me.    The songs I did like - The Final Frontier (minus the 4 minute start)  El Dorado (I like this song, but 3 minutes into it, when the main chorus hits, I find that I lose a little bit of interest, I think it's because, in my mind anyway, it just doesn't flow naturally)  Maybe I'm weird...  Starblind    I found songs like Mother of Mercy and The Alchemist to be just kinda...so-so.  While by rights I should like the Alchemist as I usually dig faster paced Maiden, I had a hard time really liking this one.    I really wanted to like Isle of Avalon, but there is just something with the way Bruce sings and the way the guitars are that I don't care for.  Again, I really hate how long the opening goes before it gets into a heavier faster part of the song.    Not a fan of When the Wild Wind Blows, The Talisman, (Bruce's voice kinda annoys me on that one) Coming home, and The Man Who Would Be King.    After looking at the above, I think a major annoyance is that so many of the songs seem to take a few minutes to really get going.  While I like it on some of their songs, I don't want it on the majority of the disc.    I'm going to keep listening and hope that it grows on me, but it just doesn't make me excited like BNW did, and I think that is the BIGGEST reason I am so disappointed.  I had my expectations set to a certain standard after seeing the video for The Final Frontier, and the disc didn't live up to it.  :(    Again, take this for what it's worth.  More power to those who like it.  I hate the majority of Rap music but that doesn't mean everyone should.  Same thing goes for Iron Maiden's latest.
B002LFPAUC|5|JOHN CLEESE - OF COURSE IT IS A CLLECTORS MUST HAVE.
B003P2WO5E|5|This book is amazing! Brandon Sanderson is probably one of the best &#34;magic system&#34; creators I've ever read, and the amount of world building that has gone into this series is astounding. If you love truly epic fantasy stories, and especially a book that takes more than a few hours to read, definitely consider giving this a try. I've read it several times now, and every time I've read it I've picked up more of the little plot points and details that I missed on every previous read.<br /><br />I had originally purchased this as an eBook, and read it that way the first time, but... The book is filled with illustrations of the cities and creatures in the world (drawn by one of the characters!) and it is worth the money to buy the hardback, because they contribute a lot to the story.<br /><br />As a side note, Sanderson is one of the nicest authors I've been fortunate enough to meet, and was more than willing to sign my copy of his Mistborn trilogy. Support a nice guy and great author, buy this book! (And the rest of them.)
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book should be required of all students in school to read. Yes it is a tear jerker but the author introduces the layman to the inside thoughts, fears, and struggles of cancer kids. I couldn't put it down.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5|The author explains the impact of established Roman and Jewish power upon the events leading to the crucifixion and uses highly readable and understandable prose to make a strong case for his interpretation of the historical Jesus. The author also highlights how the religion of Paul may conflict with the religion of the early Christians in Jerusalem, such as the Apostles Peter and James, the brother of Jesus.

B00KX44P22|5|Who DOESN'T  love Downton Abbey???
B00FATEJYE|5|Free to download and play...yes. Unless you are VERY patient though you will spend some cash to upgrade your character or buy new ones. Still, worth every penny.
B001N9ESQ4|4|We've seen Before Sunrise and also Before Midnight so we needed to see Before Sunset.  I didn't feel it was quite as good as the other two but it was worth seeing.  Ethan Hawke just didn't see like the right match for Judy Delpy.
B006LSZECO|3|Much better than the movie, but kind of slow.
B00BAXFECK|5|Always nice to be able to recommend something that an author has worked so diligently at and acheived very good results. By the time the reader finishes The Goldfinch, the characters described in the novel are fully fleshed, and you have a clear picture of each one from inside out.<br /><br />In a way The Goldfinch is like reading Tolstoy or Dickins or Hardy, in that so many character studies are presented here with such detail, humor and flair. The language and style of the novel is interesting throughout and presents human nature from interesting perspectives and you feel that you are in the room with the characters throughout much of the story.<br /><br />All in all, a great book to read like several short stories pieced together into one big novel.
B0083ZRAJS|5|I downloaded this so we could read it aloud to eachother on camping trips, ended up reading alone during book time at home, long before our camping trip.
B00VFTAXUC|3|Uh. Long. Way long. Probably a very good movie IN theaters. Visual candy. At home on the smaller screen it was ok, interesting at times but mostly 3 hours I'll never get back. Mind you - I LOVE the Space Odyssey films.
B00499NHLC|5|I enjoy the show enough that I rewatch it often. The plots are clever dialogue is terrific and the relationship between the two main characters fascinating.
B00008S2VG|4|I have always enjoyed Madonna's music, however, this listening experience was different because it made me think.  Madonna's lyric writing is at it's best.  The album is similar to her previous album, &quot;Music&quot;, in the way it mixes electronic sounds and production with acoustic instruments such as guitars.  The album starts off with the first single &quot;American Life.&quot;  The song is great and introduces the theme of the album very well.  The rap towards the end came as a shock (not that that's bad).  I would have enjoyed seeing a video for the song, but I respect Madonna's decision to withold the video due to its content.  &quot;Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Love Profusion&quot; are my favorite songs on the album.  Overall the album is great, however, it is not as upbeat as some of her previous works.

B002QKZLZ6|3|This is a good belt-case for carrying your Plantronics Pro headset when not using the unit.    Your chances of losing the headset are minimized when compared to putting the headset down somewhere, or having it in a pocket that you may sit on.
B009HV2JT8|3|I knew this movie couldn't be as bad as some of the one star reviews indicated, and it wasn't.  The title says it all.  This Lincoln's weapon of choice is an ax which he swings with skill and gritty determination, all to avenge the murder of his family when he was a boy.  The film is heavy on action and special effects.  Unfortunately, some of the effects wre mediocre at best, most notably during an insane horse chase and the climatic train ride to Gettysburg.  It does do a nice job of weaving in actual events during Lincoln's life, both before his presidency and after, along with the fantastical vampire plot.  This was not enough, however, to make up for a weak story driven by what is seemingly a sudden and confusing desire by the vampires for world domination.  This is a decent enough film, but not one I would watch again.
B000FA675C|5|Wonderful! This is such a good book. The ideas in it are totally feasible. It makes one think,and can easily open many a closed mind!
B00A6CCF0K|5|Dr. Sleep is Stephen King at his best.  I would rate it in his top 5, which is high praise when you consider the vast number of books he has written.  King has the unique ability to transport his readers into the universe he has created within his novel.  My regret with Dr. Sleep was that things seemed to wrap up too quickly, without leaving any loose ends that might lead into a sequel.  I wanted to learn more about the True Knot, more about Rose's history.  I wanted to watch Abra grow into a young woman, to see Dan finally achieve happiness and stability, to learn more about Dan's connection to Abra's mother.  In short, I wasn't ready for the book to end - which is a good thing.
B0088W6LAK|5|Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge are still at it in season 2. Best sci fi show that incorporates myths and legends from all around the world, with sci fi and humor very nicely.

B00005T30L|5|I thought Ghost World was a VERY cool movie.  I related to it so much.  I could relate to both the girls and the character of Seymour.  I related to the girls because I remember being the way they were ... I remembered having a friend that I was really tight with, went everywhere with etc.  I remember that attitude that went with youth..feeling that I was superior, invincible, that I was cool and everyone else was uncool and just existed to be critiqued and made fun of, even humiliated.  It wasn't that these girls were special in that regard.  That's part of growing up that we all go through to some degree, and we (almost always) eventually grow out of it and learn that we are vulnerable, imperfect, needy, and that other people can be different... and not because they're just losers..and that other people need and deserve respect.  Thora's character grows a little in this kind of way by the end of the movie.  She eventually befriends Seymour and sees a lot that's likeable in him.  And she always made fun of that old man waiting for the bus that never came .. and yet eventually the bus DID come (he was right after all), and at the end of the movie she herself got on the bus (what was once something to ridicule had now become something she understood and wanted for herself).<br />I related to the character of Seymour because I saw myself in him also, more the way I am today ... a loner, an 'older guy' - less attractive than I used to be, 'strange' to younger people, eccentric (a collector of rare music, with a collection almost the same size too), someone younger people tend to ignore or want to make fun of because I can't relate to them as much and no longer look like them or dress like them, but someone who they'd probably think was cool if they took the time to get to know me, like Thora's character started out thinking Seymour was the biggest loser in the world, yet eventually ended up thinking he was cool (ignoring what her friend thought about him, and thinkingfor herself) and she even ended up falling for him, sleeping with him etc.
B000002GFT|5|Great!!!
B00797MB0O|3|Not enough of a plot line. Why did they break up in the beginning? Why did she leave the town (besides it being crappy and smelling like fish poo?) Who was Buddy's wife to her? More history on the background of the people in the story so we know what significance they play in it. Like the man she slept with before she went back home. Was he a stranger or did she know him? We don't even see how she met him. Need more details!!!
B005LAII44|5|We fans finally get to see G.I. Joe: Retaliation after waiting nine months due to being converted to 3D, the poor box office performance of Battleship at the box office, negative test screenings from the studio that was so bad and so they decided to add an additional scene that has (Roadblock and Duke playing Call of Duty) while pushing its release back, including showcasing Channing Tanem's Duke in the first fifteen minutes of the film involving a real key scene that end up in death due to him being a bigger star thanks to Magic Mike, 21 Jump Street and The Vow. Retaliation was originally to release on June 29, last summer but with the ideas mentioned above, Magic Mike and Ted both took its place and would had faced The Amazing Spider-Man a few days later and it would had killed the film despite they both going after the same audience, Brave from a week previously, Ted in its original July 13 release date and The Dark Knight Rises weeks later, which somehow made sense and now will end up about $400 million worldwide due to the 3D boost and the international popularity of the stars. Not bad for a film that was delayed by nine months and given mixed to negative reviews from the critics and audience members, something we don't see in a film everyday. Unlike The Wolfman which its problems began when the film was pushed away from its November 2008 release at $90 million and reshoot most of the movie while adding more money to the already $90 million and it never came out until February 2010 and became a box office disater both critical and financally and G.I. Retaliation made the better mistake by not wasting additional money reshooting the whole film again (and the 3D just payed for itself) than the Wolfman. It's a turn your brain off movie when you walk in the door and or takes you back to when G.I. Joe the cartoons were back in the 1980s!<br /><br />This is much better than The Rise of Cobra, that film was a disappointment to the G.I. Joe name, we get to see Cobra Commander just like the cartoons, The Rock as Roadblock and Bruce Willis as Joe kicking butt and taking names, Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes fighting, the VFX is much better, the story and characters are campy but all in good fun, the RZA stinks as blind master and no offense should stick to music, Destro gets a sort of cameo apperance from The Rise of Cobra. We will see a third installment which was just went through its process of one step closer of being made! See the famous mountain fight scene with Snake Eyes, Jinx and Storm Shadow against a series of red ninjas that is worth seeing over and over again!mmander just like the cartoons, The Rock as Roadblock and Bruce Willis as Joe kicking butt and taking names, Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes fighting, the VFX is much better, the story and characters are campy but all in good fun, the RZA stinks as blind master and no offense should stick to music, Destro gets a sort of cameo apperance from The Rise of Cobra.

B007UQ5Z1G|5|First off I would like to say if someone handed you this cd for the first time without hearing anything else the band had made what would you take it as? It's something interesting to do with bands and Linkin Park was the first band that made me start thinking that. With Minutes to midnight they all collectively as a BAND started writing whatever they wanted. I want that. Some people just get so pissed off about that and it really does make me laugh when I see very dull reviews on how it doesn't sound like the old stuff... they suck and are sellouts. I will tell you how they've impacted me. ( If you don't wanna read then just scroll down.)<br /><br /> I full heartedly believe that this band is one of those bands that I took for granted because I heard numb when I would watch mtv in the morning before school and I liked it. I came from a heavy metal/hard rock background which was at the time pantera, lamb of god, system of a down, slipknot and others that would be too long of a list but those are some. They're still my favorite bands to listen to because they all sound different from each other! That is what is so great about music. Back to the story lol I heard bleed it out and I remember sitting thinking wow these guys kinda suck now.so then not up until last year I heard a thousand suns and for some reason I grew out of my old mindset which brings me to this. Linkin Park has changed my way of thinking with music. I didn't like the new stuff because I would sheepishly listen to their new stuff once for not even the whole song. (Which points to a lot of the people who wrote the negative reviews.)<br />OK! So out of this whole thing I learned that if you listen to something with an open heart and mind then you never know what you will end up loving. A lot of that had to do with becoming a musician.<br /><br />Linkin Park have come back with another solid album. Every album they come out with is like a picture of where they are and I really love that about this band.My opinion is they keep getting better.<br /><br />If you are a MUSIC lover then I recommend this cd for you. If you're looking for a one genre band then you simply just have to get off this page and look for it.<br /><br />Each song has something different great about it and that is why I can't choose a favorite haha! This wasn't a review too much on the cd but hopefully you can take something from this and learn that music can take you to places you never dreamed of physically and mentally. Experiencing everything from Hybrid Theory to this cd has at some point helped me through my highs and my lows in life. Thank you Linkin Park.
B004X6PRO6|1|Would not recommend. Found the bold distressing, sad with no redeeming qualities. I would not recommend to any of my friends.
B004U7JYXS|5|Great film!
B0043D2D64|3|For most of the book I found the story enjoyable.  Then there came a point where I was left wondering where it could really go and achieve a successful culmination.  In my opinion it did not reach that point.  A well written book that was difficult to end satisfyingly for the reader, in my humble opinion.
1476751447|1|Too much space between the covers. It'a a horrid, self-serving book which does little in the way of honesty.
B00005JM02|5|Finding Nemo is a great movie, not just for kids, but for adults as well.  The movie is mainly about two clown fish, Marlin, and his son, Nemo. The whole movie is centered on Marlin trying to find Nemo, hence the title \\"Finding\\" Nemo. Marlin searches the whole ocean with his new friend, Dori. They encounter a lot of dangerous and cool obstacles, like sharks, turtles, and even whales. Meanwhile, Nemo is in a fish tank and makes lots of new friends from all different pet stores, and even one from the ocean. The aquarium fish are even friends with a pelican, who has an important role later in the movie.      One of the reasons that the movie is so great is the plot. It is a father going out to find his son, but at the same time it keeps people laughing. You can sometimes guess what will be coming up next, but there are also a few surprises that you wouldn't expect. Another reason this movie is good, is that voicing is about as perfect as it could get. They couldn't have picked better voices for these characters. Each one matches the bodies perfectly. Ellen DeGeneres especially does a great job playing the role of Dori and Albert Brooks does a fantastic job with the voice of Marlin. The way each actor portrays their characters makes the film even funnier than it truly is.     One last reason is that the movie has a wonderful message. It really shows the love that parents can have for their children. Even though they might get into fights or arguments, parents are still willing to risk everything just for their child. It also shows the message of true friendship. Dori ended up being a true friend to Marlin, and Nemo made true friends with the others in the tank. The message is one of the overall best I have seen.      Overall I would give this movie 5 stars out of five. I have seen it many times, and it never gets old. I even enjoy quoting some specific of the parts in the movie. It is so great, that whenever I see a clown fish, I always think it is Nemo! You could be the same way if you watch this movie.

B006LSZECO|4|A great thriller that does not follow any formula. Flynn constantly surprises the reader with twists while also commenting on themes in society. Would recommend.
0671449028|5|My daughter and I love this book. I have it memorized and often recite it to her at bedtime while she is drifting off to sleep. I think that this book is a must for anyone with small children. I must admit, I'm a bit concerned about those reviewers who express concern about the realism in book. If they are so concerned about excerising after bathing, shouldn't they also be concerned about animals that can brush their teeth? I mean, it is a children's book!
1559408758|5|This movie, unlike, say, The Decline Of Western Civilization, conveys a realistic portrayal of what it's like to be in a working, touring band.  Admittedly, it goes a bit overboard, but it's still pretty accurate.  This is coming from a working musician who has been playing in front of audiences for over twenty years. <br /> <br />The technical problems - getting lost on the way to the stage, the six-inch Stonehenge monolith (complete with dwarves kicking it around), the wireless receiver picking up air traffic noise, the pod that fails to open - every working musician has had problems like that, although I'm pretty safe in saying that there haven't been too many exploding drummers.  And the arguments between the members of the group are all too familiar to anyone who has picked up a guitar, bass, or drum sticks. <br /> <br />At any rate, this film should be required viewing for anyone who thinks they want to be a musician.  If, after watching it, they still think they can handle it, they should go ahead.  However, I'm sure that more than a few people sat down to watch it and decided afterward not to go to the hock shop and buy that old guitar they were looking at the week before. <br /> <br />All of that said, this is a hysterically funny film.  Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, and Michael McKean are amazingly talented comedians, actors, and songwriters.  It's hard not to tap your foot to songs like \\"(Tonight) I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight\\" or \\"Big Bottom\\". <br /> <br />See this film.  See it again.  Watch it on a continuous loop over and over again for a week.  You'll still be laughing when it's done.
B000MR9D5E|5|This is one series that we all love to watch together - no matter what our age, sex, or interest.  The scenes are too awesome to describe.  I recommend this to everyone!
B00C1N9JWO|5|I'd give this 10 stars if possible! Best book of the series so far.
B00003CX8Y|5|The movie was very good and I enjoyed it a lot. I loved the story and it is one of my favorites. It was easy to follow, but I watched it in French so I did not like the way the songs changed in the movie because it didn’t sound the same. Overall the movie is great! :)
B00FAPF5U0|5|I'm SO happy to finally have candy crush for my kindle!!! Totally addicted! Only thing I dislike is having to wait for more lives after I use my set of 5...

B00DV2D0JC|5|Great Game! It kept me entertained for hours. The graphics are great and so realistic that it actually scared me sometimes when the Legates popped up. Would recommend it to anyone.
B00129H7VS|5|First of all if this isn't your genre then I won't convince you to get this movie, but if it is and you already have the dvd set as I do why get the bluray version?<br /><br />Well other than the added content the best reason is quality of the audio and video. I'm watching this on a sony 1080p 42\\" tv and Yamaha receiver for audio. Right away I noticed the clarity in the audio, the new audio improvements are obvious on my setup and that's where the all the goodness begins. As for the improved picture quality, my bluray player up converts rather well but in the first few minutes of the first episode, where Sobel picks the loose thread of Lipton's shirt from his new chevrons, you actually see the thread, and I was sitting 6 feet away, later on in other episodes you see the beads of sweat on some of the characters faces and can read the names on uniforms etc. I immediately popped the dvd version in the bluray player and couldn't see any of this on the dvd version, up converted by the player or the receiver which both do decent up converting. The added clarity in the audio, sharpness and detail in the picture makes watching this series over very worth while.<br /><br />Highly recommended, if you enjoy the series already, I won't try and convince you to like the show itself if you already don't but if you do like it the bluray version is worth it over the dvd box set, hell it's even worth it to get a bluray player to watch it if you already like it :-)
B005LAJ212|5|This series is very very good, I was recommended to watch it I do not regret to spend time on it, I am looking forward to watch the second series
B0049J3QNG|5|my niece loves Toy Story anything!
B00B2V66VS|4|Just as fun as the first one, performs better on my kindle fire as well. Has a few new twists and additions which keep it fresh enough, and the addictiveness and &quot;just one more run&quot; attitude is as strong as ever.

B00DUGCLY4|2|Not my kind of game
B00011KHTM|5|This is what I needed but be careful which one you need. Older macs or mini dvi and newer macs use display port.
B001V7SME2|5|I really enjoyed this movie. I am looking for the original one in the original language with english sub-titles. I have the re-done version in english (DVD). The American made version (Let Me In) although it's a lot more dramatic and the dialogue is re-done, I still like this one the best.
B001NLKXK2|5|A beautifully written and genuine story.  I was mesmerized by the honest and compassionate glimpse of what a family with EOA experiences. Could not put it down.
B007EECSFA|5|Kate Morton has a way of weaving a tale!  Love love love this book.  I look forward to her next novel!

B009ZQ8FQG|5|The Best season yet! Definitely leaves you wanting more. Can't wait to see what's in store next season for Downton.
B0006N2EZ0|5|Oh, my God, this movie is like so old, but it is still my favorite movie of all time. Kevin Costner is the knight and shining armor that all girls dream of and Whitney Houston's role is very realistic of celebrities, but by the end, you learn to love her. It is a beautiful love story that made me cry.
B00J2VSS0C|3|I have played several games like this on my desk-top computer and found them simple and boring.  I took a chance based on the screenshots and have been pleasantly surprised with how its kept my attention.  Some of the descriptions of the items are like crossword puzzle clues and make you think.

B004GJ1XU2|5|This is a must have movie for baby boomers and those trying to understand what the baby boomer generation is all about.  Great ensemble cast with great actors before they were well known - Glenn Close, William Hurt, Tom Berenger, and, although you don't ever see his face, Kevin Costner, an unknown at the time who played the &#34;Chillee,&#34; and whose other contributions to the film ended up on the cutting room floor.  The soundtrack is fabulous as well.

B00CWY76CC|4|This game is very good not overly difficult but just challenging enough to keep your attention hope they make more levels and keep up the good work
B00A80SHFM|5|Phenomenal!  Hugh Jackman is one of my favorite performers, and he was magnificent in his depiction.  I have to disagree with the critics, however, on Russell Crowe's singing.  While he will never rank up there with Hugh Jackman and Josh Groban and Alfie Boe; he did a good job.
B008JFUQ16|5|Saw it for first time just now.  Like with the first one I laughed so hard and much it hurt.  Gru is asked to help find and stop a super villain even though he is retired and just a dad now.  The minions and girls are a riot.  Gru is Gru.  Only there is love in this one.  Love and a HUGE backstabbing.  SO funny for the full family.  Lots of action and incredible laughs.  I can't wait to watch it again.
B00C7KXUOE|5|Great series! You will want more!
B00ILHW6AG|4|As with King's novels in the past, this book starts very well and will hold a readers attention throughout the book. The problem with this book, to me, does not appear to end. A reader is left to his own thoughts as to what happens after the book ends. I can live with that though it will leave many people with the feeling that death is not a good way to end living a good life. Read this book at your discretion, but be warned, you may not like the ending.
B00821OX98|5|Great show, can't wait  for more episodes!!!!  I enjoy most post apocalyptic shows, and this has not disappointed!  Love it.
159514188X|4|This is an excellent book, a quick read perfect for school breaks. Its message about suicide and peer awareness will make you reflect on your behavior and positively impact your attitude towards others. Thirteen Reasons Why is a good fit for anyone familiar with the high school experience. Jay Asher does a great job entertaining readers with revealing and relatable details of teenage life, which many authors tend to avoid. Although he touches on some serious and emotional subjects, they are balanced with humor, leaving you inspired rather than depressed.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5|Guitar work is superb, keys, bass and drums top notch as expected.  Steven is even is fine voice for the most part - a couple of little hiccups, but hey, I couldn't do it!  Thanks guys!  Memphis Loves Kenny Wayne Shepherd -- but he knows that.  Steven -- you have to come back to town soon!!
0385737955|3|I love dystopian fiction, and I had high, high hopes for this book.  The plot had so much potential to deliver a great read, but the flat characters kept me from losing myself in the story.  I just didn't care about them, and the fake, forced language of the Gladers was annoying.  Props to the author for a plot line interesting enough to make me finish the book and for a surprise twist at the end that will force me to read the next in the series.
B00EHMFC78|4|I do like the Will Robie series.  The information provided about life in North Korea also makes the book entertaining and informational (although it probably wouldn't suffice for research for the State Department).  There is a sub-plot in the book that seems to be added just to get the book to be a reasonable length which is OK since it doesn't subtract from the overall plot...it's just kind of a detour but you get back to the main road.  I also read the Jack Reacher series and find if you like those books you will like this one.
0439023521|5|I cannot describe how much I enjoyed this book.  I can't even begin to tell you what it's about.  I ask that you try and read it and if after 20 pages you have absolutely no interest, it's not for you.  But let me tell you that everyone who followed my advice has read and loved the entire trilogy.
B00E9P959O|5|Awesome!

B008Y7J372|5|This movie has it all. JOHN CANDY, need I say more? This is a heartwarming story about 4 guys from Jamaica in the winter Olympics. We lost John way too early and he does a good job in a more serious role. This film rocks.
B000AP04MO|4|\\"Two for the Road\\" might sometimes make you feel annoyed or fidgety while you watch it, as it did me, but it sticks with you. After having let it sit in my memory for several months, I feel like I can review it.<br /><br />I had never heard of it when I came across it at the video store. \\"A young Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn? That's for me!\\" I thought. Two of my favorite actors at any stage of their careers, and Albert Finney was irresistible as a young man in \\"Tom Jones.\\" The box made \\"Two for the Road\\" sound like a screwball romantic comedy, so I was not at all prepared for what followed.<br /><br />First, if you expect Albert Finney's character to be endearing, modify your expectation. Sometimes he is, but often he's an arrogant jerk. Audrey Hepburn's got a bit of an edge to her character as well.<br /><br />Second, if you expect a conventional romantic comedy, set that expectation aside. While the movie has some very funny scenes, and you see lots of lovely French countryside (as well as a variety of cars for automotive buffs), \\"Two for the Road\\" makes little effort to be crowd-pleasing or predictable. Instead, we travel down the rocky road of marriage, in an experimental but not wholly successful series of flashbacks.<br /><br />We begin with an unhappy English couple, architect Mark Wallace and his wife Joanna (Finney and Hepburn), flying to the South of France to meet an important client of Mark's. The movie goes back and forth over a twelve-year period, following the couple on various road trips through France, to look at how they started, how they arrived where they are, and what the future might hold for them. Sometimes they are close, sometimes they are distant, sometimes they are happy, sometimes they are alienated. They don't always treat each other well.<br /><br />The acting is good and Hepburn and Finney have great chemistry. The tone bounces all over the place, by turns romantic, wistful, caustic, and trying too hard to be hilarious. The pacingis a bit herky-jerky as well, and some episodes go on too long. For instance, when an obnoxious American family first joins Mark and Joanna on their travels, it's funny, but we get tired of them before Mark and Joanna do.<br /><br />By the end I felt worn out and unsettled. But as time passed, I realized that was the point. Instead of an easy-to-digest fairy tale, the filmmakers present a version of truth about a long-term relationship in a turbulent world of confused values and ask the audience to think for ourselves along the way. As a result, \\"Two for the Road\\" stays with the viewer in a way a movie that spoon-feeds the audience can never do.<br /><br />The DVD we rented had only fair sound and picture quality. This unusual movie deserves some restoration.
B000NQRE9Q|5|Simply put: this is a well crafted blu ray boxset. My wife was disappointed because we got rid of a lot of her DVDs a few years ago, one of those being her Indiana Jones trilogy boxset. As soon as I heard this set was available for pre-order, I hopped all over it. Of course, Amazon, being as awesome as it always is, the price started out high, but dropped quite a bit when it was finally released. I received the movies the same day they were in stores and couldn't be happier.

1416550550|2|This was a well written story, and the historical potions were believable, but there were so many treads to this story with people I didn't really like. To much slogging through the garbage for too little reward.
B0025KVLTW|1|Many of the beatles albums now sound dated in my opinion, and none more so than MMT.  The sonic improvement can only go so far in improving the hopelessly out of date music.  I am the Walrus, indeed.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is addicting, but you can stop playing it on your own will...... Not Bad!
B00AS1Q93S|4|Jake Reacher does not get the girl.  What a shame that the producers and director forgot about Jack's masculinity.  They just brushed by Jack's ability to get the girl that he gets in every one of the Jack Reacher stories.  Other than that I was satisfied with the product.  6 foot 6 inches, 250 pounds,  that is not Tom Cruise.  However, I still think Tom does a good job of making Jack Reacher come alive on the Big Screen.  I would not mine if Tom Cruise did another Jack Reacher story.  I really LOVED seeing Lee Child do his cameo bit.  That reminds me of Clive Cussler and his cameo bits in many of his books.
B0086700CM|5|I love this game. it is super addicting and keeps me entertained. one game everyone should have downloaded on their phone or tablet.
B008GXHOFW|5|This is a giant open world spider-man game  which aims to let you do what a spider can and  succeeds with flying colors. PROS it has great game play free roam and combat. its fluid and very colorful it has a  good original story NOT GREAT but good!  There is also randomly generated missions generated side missions (WHICH ARE ALL THE SAME) and boss fights spliced with quick time events. CONS unbearable voice acting ESPECIALLY spider-man/peter. Horrable grapphics if u have a old android tablet. and Of course some people may not like the touch controls (but thats true with all mobile games!)
B00G2GMRCU|5|Great book.  When is the next Camel Club book going to be published?  Really enjoy every David Baldacci book I read.
0385340990|5|This is a really marvelous book.  But before you read it, look at a map, and see where the Channel Islands are in relation to France (occupied by the Germans 1941 to 1945) and England.  And then get into this book - just letters, diaries, journal entries, but still enthralling.  A reviewer thought the second half weeker - absolutely not.  With the absolutely most delightful proposal of marriage at the end.  No, I don't read \\"women's books\\" or romances (not if I can help it), history & science & science fiction and fantasy is more my style, but this one was interesting from the start and more and more enthralling as it continued.
B00BSBUZPK|5|A gift my my mother in law. She loved it.

B00HVJB4VM|1|would have made a better new yorker article or used an editor.  The book lacked the cohesiveness of his prior work.
1400031354|5|This does not merely live up to the first int the series - it is even better, as McCall Smith's writing skills have clearly improved even more. (It also lacks the terrible misprints that the British first edition of his first book had in profusion). So why not do more than enjoy this book  but buy 10 copies for friends at Thanksgiving and 10 more at Christmas and see all these splendid books, set in Botswana, on the bestseller list. They are all a joy and McCall Smith is truly a national treasure. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)
0307956350|5|The number of twists and turns in this novel make it a page turner to the very last sentence.  The author does an amazing job of creating the characters as believable.....a challenge given the storyline.  Kate and Dexter have been married for 10 years, have two children and live on the outskirts of Washington, DC.  That is where the commonality with most readers ends.  Kate has been a field officer for the CIA having done all such a position entails, and since her first child was born, an analyst for them.  Dexter thinks she works for the State Department.  Dexter, on the other hand has secrets of his own that Kate can't even begin to guess at.  One day Dexter arrives home telling Kate he has a marvelous job in Luxembourg and they are moving.  She sees this as a chance to become a fulltime Mother and have the exciting life of an ex-pat.  Leaving the Agency is difficult enough but under these circumstances, exceptionally difficult.  Nonetheless, she resigns and they move to Luxembourg.  Kate finds herself lonely and bored, and Dexter is traveling all of the time.  She makes friends with another couple and soon realizes they are there to investigate \\"someone\\".  Is that Kate for her deeds with the CIA or Dexter for reasons she cannot imagine?  And the plot twists and turns from there until the surprising conclusion.  A book worth reading.
B001E95ZHY|5|Funny movie. Rainn Wilson plays a drummer that gets let go right before the band finally makes it. Pete Best of the Beatles has a small cameo. 20 years later, his nephew has a band that needs a drummer. Good story. Rainn Wilson does a great job.
3836504715|5|If you want to study a \\"classic\\" photographer that has photographed \\"classic\\" French street scenes (Paris and surroundings), then this is your book.    Beautifully printed.     Highly recommended.
0553106635|5|I've already read this book (and the rest of the series so far) and loved it, it's amazing. Even though I read it before I really wanted to own a copy in the original language. I already read it again, this edition is crear.

B003XF1XOQ|5|Very good finish
014241543X|1|After seeing the movie trailer for this book, I ordered it on kindle and began to read. My first impression from the movie trailer was that it would be good, maybe a little cheesy, but good. But as I read further I realized that it was completely cheesy, poorly written, had a weak plot and unlikable, shallow charaters. Overall the worst book I have EVER read. The main character is portentous and predictable. The supporting characters are just boring and the parents are ridiculously permissible about EVERYTHING. I get that they are ex-rock stars, but they are also parents and they should disipline their children to a greater extent. Overall the book was VERY disappointing and I would beg of every serious reader TO NOT READ THIS STUPID BOOK. But that's just my opinion...
B00JVZ0DQG|5|Love my farm.
B003QTUQGU|1|This was a waste of money and time. I even saw it in 3D. Sooo much more could have been done with this film. Burton has little imagination and ruined the storyline on top of it. The best part was the cat. And the Mad Hatter's make up.
B008JFUO72|4|it was a gift
B00BP4Z8XY|5|this movie is great my kids love it and the nerd in me loves all the references to different video games

B003ODIZL6|3|I like  this but i think that we should be able to just search up the words we are looking for because  it takes too long to go to the  word we are looking for!
B000NQRE9Q|5|It's fantastic to have these classics in high def. The extras are not much more than the DVDs, if at all. No commentary tracks.

B000QRIGLC|5|Excellent reading. Its hard to put the book down once you start.<br />An exciting book and portrayal of loyalty and extreme valor and courage<br />of the men who took part in their mission on behalf of their country.<br />We owe them and others like them a sincere debt of gratitude.
B00LVTFS4M|5|Others have said that no new ground has been broken by this collaboration, particularly with regard to Scott Walker. This is true. But sometimes you want a bit of consistency in your bizzarro music. If you're reading this, you know what I mean. There's exploration and there's agitation. This you can listen to without being jolted out of whatever else you were doing by some loud strange noise, and not so much word salad and discussions of or with one's bodily fluids.<br /><br />A good hour of the aural equivalent of the cd booklet cover image. The meteor has crashed, you didn't hear the full blast, but what strange vapours and unearthly colours it holds for the too curious investigator...
B005MMY9A8|5|Oh, my what a hunk of a guy! I love these Marvel Superheros!
B00007GZQZ|5|This is one of my very favorite movies ever.  Whether the critics liked it or not, if you own a home, you will get a kick out of this movie.  If you don't own a home, watch it anyway because Tom Hanks and Shelly Long are hilarious.  We have found ourselves quoting one-liners from it on many occasions.
B003ZSJ212|5|Okay so I almost decided not to purchase because of everyone's outcry about the changes.  Ill keep this simple...  1) The picture quality and sound is amazing on bluray!!!!  My wife who could care less about 1080p and 1000 watts of 7.1 surround heaven looked at it for 5 seconds and i quote \\"Oh my god the bluray version is so clear\\".  I have purchased movies that came out before bluray, that where later released on bluray....nothing was done to take advantage of the new hardware out there....  Gladiator is the last one I bought, that was released before bluray came out....I was so disappointed when i started it up  2) if you are buying this for nostalgia...dont ....just buy the vhs  The changes are there...but I bought this to watch starwars on high end modern day home theatre equipmen....Mr.Lucas did not disappoint!!!

B002UZCJ8Y|3|Bruce Willis is known for two types of movies.  The first type are the shoot-em up action flicks as typified by his Die Hard franchise.  The second type are the thinking movies, the ones that mark him as a good actor who knows how to pick original roles.  Examples of the latter include The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and now this 2009 film that slipped under most people's radar; Surrogates.  The movie's premise is simple enough, in the near future, much of mankind live their daily lives thru human-like robots known as surrogates.  The main plot of the movie revolves around a series of murders, the politics behind them, and the attempts to solve them by the cop played by Willis.  And like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, the movie's climax involves some surprising twists.  Hence the movie is a mystery-suspense thriller with some action scenes behind it.  The movie is futuristic, but not really in the science fiction genre as the technology displayed in the film is probably achievable within a decade or so.    The only drawback to the movie is its main subplot, which revolves around the failing marriage between the characters played by Willis and actress Rosamund Pike.  It seems many of Willis's serious movies features a subplot of marital distress.  This was present in the Die Hard movies, Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Armageddon, and now this film.  This subplot has been repeated too many times, and could have been done better for this film.  Outside of this critique, this was a good film that moved quickly and did not drag.
B00IX9UTLU|5|great book love it
B00IN3XF76|5|This an amazing app/game. The developers put so much work into what they've been doing to make this successful! Lets go #Whovians Thanks again Tiny Rebel Games and Adipose for so much great content, fun, and laughs! I hope to see you in person one day!
B00005JKC3|3|This movie may have been a tad drawn out (i.e. flashback scenes with Bruce Banner/Dad), but it would have at least been bearable without all of the ridiculous split-screens and similar layouts that Ang Lee used in presenting this story. Had it been a one-screen movie throughout I would have given it a 7 or 8 out of 10, but as is I can only give it a 5 (if that) and I have loved Marvel Comics and all its characters for the past 28 years. I thought Marvel was going for realism (as real as a comic can be), and although I know that the Hulk is not the X-Men or Spider-Man, the &quot;realism&quot; seemed to vanish once the Hulk appears in this movie. The split-screens get so ridiculous, it makes you not take the story seriously, much less even able to pay attention with all of the excess flutter of NOTHING being thrown at you by trivial picture boxes and page turns. I applaud Ang Lee for having the guts to use a CGI Hulk, but to not even explain the PURPLE PANTS just makes this thing even more ridiculous. In my opinion, he basically made a real expensive joke ($137 million + $37 million marketing) that hardly paid for itself at the theatres. Thank god for loyal fans who will also pay for the DVD and kids who just love the character of the HULK and will buy the toys or they would have lost their *#S#* on this movie. PLEASE DON'T LET ANG LEE DIRECT ANOTHER MARVEL MOVIE!!!

B00BRUQ7ZY|5|This book answers so many questions as well as raises so many more that I as a professed Christian have long had.  While I was sometimes frustrated by the author's failure to include sources from some of his assertions, it did not detract from the thesis
B001ANSSDC|4|I really like this book, it was interesting and opened my eyes to the problems that so many people go through.  Quick exposes the mind set of how people with depression and bipolar think and act the way they do to events that hurt them so much. I really like this book and I would read it before the movie because, from seeing trailers and clips to the movie, it is definitly different.
0385342047|4|This review was written by my daughter for whom I obtained a copy of MiniShopaholic.<br /><br />I have been a fan of the Shopaholic series since the first book in the series, Confessions of a Shopaholic, came out.  Sophie Kinsella does a great job of getting the reader inside the mind of Becky Brandon (nee` Bloomwood...as she would say!) and you feel you are experiencing everything right along with her.  Becky always seems to get herself into some kind of mess and it is very entertaining seeing how she works her way out of them.<br /><br />In the most recent novel, MiniShopaholic, Becky is back to her usual antics.  She is still happily married to Luke, they are living with her parents while waiting for the sale of their dream house to close, she is working as a personal shopper at a popular department store and they have a 2 year old daughter named Minnie.  Minnie seems to be acquiring the spoiled, shopaholic tendencies of her mother, which is beginning to worry Luke - and causing some animosity towards Luke and Becky since Luke feels that hiring a \\"Super Nanny\\" is necessary.  In addition to the \\"Minnie issues\\", England is experiencing an economic recession forcing people to cut back on their spending - which results in Becky promising Luke she will not shop for herself.  Obviously this is a challenge for Becky!  Becky has also decided to throw Luke a lavish surprise party during the tough financial times which she is determin ed to pull off on her own and prove to everyone that she can do it on a budget.<br /><br />Of course as in all the Shopaholic novels, Becky has to face a milllion different obstacles - most of which she brings on herself - and the reader is taken on a fun adventure trying to see how she gets herself out of trouble.  As I mentioned, Kinsella does a great job of putting the reader inside Becky's head so they feel as though they are along for the ride and she always throws a few surprises in there so just when you think a problem is solved, something else goes wrong!<br /><br />While I enjoyed MiniShopaholic, and would recommend it to other Kinsella fans, I didn't enjoy this book as much as some of the others in the series.  To be honest, while the writing of this novel is up to par with all of the other books in the series, having read all of the other ones, each subsequent Shopaholic book becomes more and more predictable.  You always know all will work out in the end so it makes it less and less exciting to keep reading.  For the other books in the series, I was always excited to pick up the book and was always in a rush to finish it to see what happens.  Reading MiniShopaholic, however, took me quite some time.  In my opinion - this should be the last in the Shopaholic series and Kinsella should now create a new character who we can grow to love as much as we love Becky!g!

B00BLCHZC2|5|I love this show, it is just down right amazing. My favorite show ever, I definitely recommend watching this show.
B00AJRQLTI|5|I have always loved this musical and so appreciate that we have access to the music. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway are superb in this film as are the rest of the cast. This CD is enchanting
B00BOLE7X0|5|While there were a few errors in fact (for example, Lincoln was laid cross-wise on the bed that was too short for him after the assassination), this was a wonderful portrayal of Lincoln. As a person who actually LIVES in the Lincoln areas, we chuckled at the famous story of the old woman who murdered her husband and was tried in the Metamora courts. If you have visited the Lincoln sites in Springfield, especially the new museum, this film brings to life the history that is preserved there. Great story, great acting, and I even could get over Sally Field playing Mary Todd Lincoln (although I have to admit, her characterization of Sybil sometimes came to mind!)
B00HCOSF3G|4|I don't consider Pharrell Williams to be a great singer, but this is a great song and he sings it well. It's a very uplifting sound. I recommend it to other music lovers.

B00F57VFXO|4|great fun James Bond with another name.  I wonder how close to reality these stories are.  Love them anyway
B000023VR6|5|this album might have the best beats of any CD ive ever heard.  Dr dre has a gift for mixing gangster beats with his unprecedented swag.  Tracks like \\"xxplosive\\" and \\"murder ink\\" show the hardcore side of dre and this album is an unarguable classic.  If you like dr dre, check out FACE, a new artist who just released his first demo and who is releasing his first original album later in 2010.

B004ZMWUCU|4|This was a quirky book, and I enjoyed it. The story centers around a middle-aged Irish man, Jamie. Some chapters are told in flash-back describing Jamie's horrific childhood in an Irish orphanage/work house during the 1940s. The more we learn of the abuse and torture the children endure, the more we are amazed that Jamie has turned out as 'normal' as he is. The other major character is Lydia, a middle-aged Irish woman living in a different town from Jamie. She needs a 'date' for a school friend's wedding, so she puts an ad in the local paper's 'lonely hearts' section. Jamie's friends encourage him to look for a wife to take care of him (after his adoptive father dies) and provide companionship. He answers Lydia's ad, and the story goes from there. The book is alternately charming and funny, and then with the orphanage experiences it is horrifying. I loved the way the author was able to weave both stories in seamlessly, without making the reader feel manipulated. An enjoyable read.
B00BVYLBP2|2|poorly acted, a little predictable and slow
B003Y5HWMW|5|I read the first installment in Martin's epic series and I can say the mini series is remarkably faithful to the book.  A couple of scenes have been invented for television, but they do not detract from the impact of the story. In fact, they enhance the subtext quite a bit, especially if you haven't read the book.  Great cast, the visuals, especially in HD, are amazing and they really capture the atmosphere of the books.  Great job all around! Highly recommended!!
B000FCK42M|5|I couldn't put down this epic of the insane drug wars...powerful and important and unforgettable and just a damn good read -

0780623819|4|&quot;Lost in Space&quot; purists probably had a problem with the &quot;updated&quot; version of the 60's show.  However, the movie basically reworks several of the better episodes from the &quot;more serious&quot; first season.  There are remnants of &quot;The Reluctant Stowaway&quot; which introduced the nefarious Dr. Smith, &quot;The Derelict&quot; wherein the crew discovers a seemingly abandoned ship, and &quot;Island in the Sky&quot; featuring the crash of the Jupiter II.<br />Also, the film expanded the role of the Judy Robinson part (Heather Graham) by presenting her as a doctor with skills essential to the success of the mission; the television show never really effectively utilized the character. The film also makes better use of the Maureen Robinson (Mimi Rogers) character who is seen as an equal to her scientist husband played by William Hurt.  As played by June Lockhart on the show, the character was often relegated to the background as the damsel in distress.<br />Matt Leblanc is appropriately &quot;macho&quot; as gung-ho pilot Major Don West.  The two younger roles of Will and Penny Robinson are handled well by Jack Johnson and Lacey Chabert.<br />Cameos by Lockhart, Angela Cartwright, Marta Kristen, Mark Goddard, and Dick Trufeld (the Robot's voice) are welcome.<br />Gary Oldman as Dr. Smith gives a very understated performance. This is due, perhaps, to the over-the-top performance of the series doctor played by Jonathan Harris.<br />Even with the plot inconsistencies and some &quot;effects&quot; that don't work, the movie is still a fairly enjoyable &quot;journey.&quot;
0321544080|5|I have been shooting for forty years and this is an inspiring book. Just one little tip was worth the price of the book to me. No, I'm not going to share that tip, buy the book as it is worth the price! I read this book cover-to-cover in one sitting. I just could not put it down. Joe shares tips and ideas on how he creates his images. Many of them were done on film but the same techniques can be applied to digital. His tips will help me reduce the time spent in Photoshop and spend more time creating images.
B000I9U99K|5|I love this movie the scenery and sets are just breath taking.  The plot is witty and suspenseful. A ton of fun.  Russell Crowe is excellent for this role.  Highly enjoyed the movie.  I wish they had made some of the other books into movies as well.  I would have enjoyed learning more about Lucky Jack and the crew of the Surprise.
B003EI2EH2|1|I saw this recommended on Facebook and was in a hurry and thought I would read it on the plane.<br />Very disappointed. I wish I had taken time to research it first. The author is a body builder and a self appointed &#34;expert&#34; with no medical background.

B0000640VO|5|I just enjoyed the move Amelie so much.  I thought that the Cinematography was wonderful.  All the vivid colors brought the world of Amelie to life before my and the rest of the viewers eyes.  I liked the way most of the story was told out of Amelie's thoughts.  This technique helped us understand Amelie.  Amelie is a must see for everyone whether the understand French or not the subtitles are easy to read and understand!<BR>P.S.  The garden gnome was the best!

B000067J1Y|5|Hot Shots! is a great movie with a great script and great acting by Charlie Sheen.  Sheen is a great comedy actor and this movie proves it.  This movie came out the same summer as one of the Naked Gun movies, and it spoofs Top Gun perfectly.  Lloyd Bridges is also great as an absent minded General.  Valarie Golino is great in this movie too.

0553801481|4|Robin Hobb, Fool's Errand (Bantam, 2002)<br /><br />Robin Hobb has, not surprisingly, done it again. Fool's Errand, the first book in the Tawny Man trilogy, is wonderful. The main characters from the Farseer books are back, but that doesn't stop her treading into Liveship Traders territory enough to draw in the fans of that series as well, and the whole makes for a wonderful introduction to the two books that follow it.<br /><br />The time is fifteen years after the events in Assassin's Quest, and an unknown but short time after the events in Ship of Destiny (certainly no more than a year). Fitz has spent a good deal of the last decade and a half in seclusion, living in a previously-abandoned cottage not far outside Forge, renouncing both his heritage and the duties of his office following the Red Ship War. As we open, Kettricken is in the process of negotiating a trade alliance with the Outislanders that will involve the betrothal of her son, Dutiful, to a noble daughter of an Outisland clan. Fitz is approached first by Chade, then by the Tawny Man himself (if you don't know who the Tawny Man is-- and it's a pretty simple process of elimination if you're familiar with the first trilogy-- I'll not spoil the surprise for you), requesting he come back to Buckkeep as a teacher and mentor for the prince. Fitz, now living under the name Tom Badgerlock, refuses until a nameless rider beings bad tidings, and Fitz is once again forced to take up the role he has always played-- the Catalyst to the White Prophet.<br /><br />That Hobb's writing is great swords-and-sorcery is no secret to anyone who's been reading her stuff. Now, though, she's got the full wight of twenty-five hundred pages apiece of two trilogies behind her, and five thousand rich, detailed pages of worldbuilding, and that just makes it all the better. Hobb does do the whole \\"flashback to reacquaint the reader with stuff\\" thing that's been so annoying in, say, recent novels by Terry Goodkind, but here it's far less obtrusive; Hobb doesn't assume that her readers have the same memory span as your average goldfish, and the premise of intelligence by the writer on the part of the reader is certainly refreshing. The only question is, if Hobb can spend five hundred pages on this, which seems a rather minor incident in the greater scheme of this story, how on earth is she going to get the whole thing told in only two more books? (A quick check at Amazon reveals part of the answer; they're both much longer than this seemingly introductory volume.) In any case, I can't wait to find out. ****'s far less obtrusive; Hobb doesn't assume that her readers have the same memory span as your average goldfish, and the premise of intelligence by the writer on the part of the reader is certainly refreshing.

0792165020|4|One advantage in having not is the motivation and desire it breeds to have. But to what cavernous depths may motivation and desire lower someone to fuel inherent megalomania? Would one lie, cheat or steal? The answer is innate. What of murder? I'll never tell.    The film, \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" explores such disturbing issues quite demonstratively and effectively. Tom Ripley's (Matt Damon) anguish, is not only to attain wealth and stature, but also the persona and very name attached to both. The opportunity obliges when an affluent New York shipping magnate hires Tom as an emissary to go to a quaint village in Italy and extract his eccentrically wayward son, Dickie Greenleaf, exceptionally played by Jude Law.    The mercenary plan suffers a miscarriage when Tom becomes enthralled by Dickie, siding with him against the elder Greenleaf's intent. Mayhem ensues as these two pseudo \\"mates\\" eventually discover that even when one tosses the perfect salad, no matter what the effort; the oil and vinegar dressing never mixes. The oil is non-polar and consistently rises to the top, while the vinegar is polar and remains at the bottom. Dickie is the oil and Tom is the vinegar.     Despite his crass rendition of \\"My Funny Valentine,\\" Matt Damon handles this complex title role with incredible precision; much like the spontaneous color transitions owned by a chameleon.  His arcane blend of lucidity, psychosis, and guile is pitch-perfect. While Gwyneth Paltrow's (Marge) effort as Dickie's forlorn and jilted girlfriend was yeoman-like, Cate Blanchett (Meredith Logue) and Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Freddie Miles) are both prolific in their diminutive roles.     As for Director Anthony Minghella, this film does not leap off the screen in full spectrum like his brilliant epic, \\"The English Patient,\\" yet he more than manages to purport dire substance to the main theme. In addition, Minghella exhumes colossal efforts from the adept ensemble cast. Under his masterful guidance and classic intuition, the cinematography reminds us of how sublime the southern tip of Italy is, and showcases the sheer elegance of the Mediterranean Coast. Scenes such as the ones where Tom is caught frolicking around in Dickie's clothes, and tears trickling down his face while taking in an opera, which parallels his actions are priceless.     One may not enjoy the dynamics of this sophisticated thriller, feeling that they may be too morally flawed. In order to smooth this doubt over a tad, Minghella himself in an interview stated, `the film is really about myself and how I imagined life in Italy.' He also said, 'it represents the worst of me.' If there is any truth to these statements, Anthony Minghella, though no longer amongst us, at least deserves a shot in the dark.

B000FC1GJW|3|In the third and final installation of His Dark Materials, Pullman’s epic story unravels even farther, before being tied up in weird, awkward little bow in the end. Gone is the tightly wound plot of The Golden Compass. I even missed the somewhat collected narrative of the second book. The Amber Spyglass introduces a multitude of new realities, one of which might be the end of our little heroes Lyra and Will. In the meantime, old characters reemerge to play crucial roles in a great battle against the Authority. Several new species are introduced to make the book feel like a hodgepodge of several different fantasy novels, and all the cost of losing touch with main characters and primary plot lines. It feels like Pullman would rather have written five more books of His Dark Materials, but his publishers told him to stop, so he just squeezed the abridged versions into TAS. It’s an example of a great story injured by epic scale.<br /><br />Read more ranting in my full review of His Dark Materials here: [...]

B0000CFW87|5|First off, I just want to say how beautiful his music is. I seriously cant belive that at his age he has such an amazing voice!! My fav songs from this album include: My confession, Mi Mancherai, when you say you love me,Per Te, broken vow, remember when it rained, and you raise me up. These songs are beautifully written and sung. He has so much passion and depth to his music. &#60;br /&#62;      Someone I saw in here wrote a preview saying  &quot; I cant believe he sang, &quot;Theres more to love than only bitterness and lies&quot;. I think you are confused about that line. I think you should read the words as you hear the song and you would get what hes trying to say. Its actually a sad yet beautiful song! Anyways, I think the CD is wonderful and I listen to it most everyday........I give it 5 stars!!!!!!!!
B005GY0Y8S|1|This book is written in a very amateur-like style. Things don't make sense - such as the heroine of this book comes to France to find her sister, who had a baby out of the wedlock, but she herself has an intercourse with a guy she met maybe a couple days before. There are numerous prejudices and stereotypes, making the heroine look very superficial, intellectually challenged and impulsive (was that really necessary?). Very difficult to sympathize with someone so bigoted and vain.  Reinforces stereotypical (and very unkind) image of Americans. Style is also very crude, making this book difficult to read. Utterly a yuck!

B00COGY2P2|4|I watched the movie because I heard the books are good, and I haven't time to read them. I thought it was pretty good, especially for a Tom Cruise movie. In my opinion, he tends to come off a little cheesy when he tries to add humor to his &#34;macho&#34;, action hero characters, but I thought he was pretty believable as Jack. I will have to read the book to see how true the movie stayed to it.
B0032W42KM|4|I really enjoyed this as an action flick. It is surprisingly well done with some cringe worthy fights near the end of the film. I believe it is probably the best in the series.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4|Reza Aslan demonstrates an excellent understanding of the time and context of the life of Jesus of Nazarath. As a life-long Christian I found nothing in his book that was incorrect. I found much that elaborated on the life of persons living in that era. Bravo, Reza Aslan.

B00AE2I4WK|1|Not much thought was put into this movie.  It was thrown together with a lame plot, people dancing and towards the end with the happy music playing as the \\"The Mob\\" gets what they wanted towards the end.. their neighborhood back. So the idea of once you live in an area,that is rented, it belongs to you?  No it doesn't.  It's being rented.  Whomever owns it can sell it any time they wish to do so.  They own it. So the day is saved because of booty popping and a lot of other dance moves?!!? Why?
B00KFW4EFA|3|I like that I can download videos and watch them later offline but I can't find a way to get them off my Kindle Fire when I'm done with them.
B002NOAF9W|3|OK, to be fair, I have to say that I haven't yet bought the remastered version.  But I definitely will.  I was at this concert (I think it was Thanksgiving week at Madison Square Garden), and even if there is just a LITLE remastering, I want to hear it.  Besides, the DSD (aka Super-Audio CD or SACD) versions of their studio albums sound amazing, with all the errors in speed during pressing finally ironed out.    But for those of you that have this new version, only you can answer this 1 important question:   Is Janis Joplin on it?    See, during the show I was getting thirsty during Ike and Tina's set.  I was pressed up close to the stage, close enough that I could see through Keith's lucite guitar.  So I made my way all the way to the back to get a soda.  Walking back towards the stage, I noticed something strange - the crowd was surging forward, which they hadn't done at all during the other Ike & Tina songs.  Then I realized the stage was drenched in strobe light, and Tina was singing Land of a Thousand Dances, and there was some strange creature next to her swinging her long hair wildly and - Holy Crap! Its Janis Joplin!    Now before you ask, I wasn't stoned (still too young), and yes I was sure, because that was the last song in the set, and when the house lights came up, Janis was roaming around the bleachers on the side of the stage.  She very kindly obliged my request for an autograph.    But the strangest part of all is this: NOT A SINGLE REVIEW of this box set mentions if this was the recording that is at the end of Disc 3.    So please, if you have this, put your headphones on (cans, not earbuds,please) queue up that track, and see if you can hear Janis' unmistakable wail alongside Tina's huskier, deeper voice.  Then please, let us all know!!    P.S. On the original recording, it was Janis who shouted the reply to Mick saying  \\"You don't want my trousers to fall down, do you?\\"

B005JZ18IY|5|Absolutely fabulous CD. Extra songs/tracks included. Ed's style(s) of folk, alternative, R&B, pop, all kinds of different songs and beats ( slow and fast songs) is soooo eclectic and really amazing.<br />His songs are enough to make you cry, from the lyrics alone. Combine the home-grown beautiful lyrics with his beautiful guitar playing and voice and you will be enthralled. Well, I am. LOL.  Haven't as of today heard any other CD's by him yet, but I sampled this one before I bought it and knew it was going to be really nice. Very  impressive. There are  few pop-ish songs that are upbeat and well done, and of course several guitar songs with just him and the guitar where his words are crystal clear and very simple with really good melodies... Pretty much all love songs in some way or another, but each different. Good job on variety for sure.<br />He really has been influenced by so many different genres, and it shows. Amazing, especially for his age. Cant wait to hear more. You won't regret it. This was the only CD that had all of the songs I was looking for, including the bonus tracks. I found that, no matter what the seller(S) advertised,  if the CD cover didn't SAY \\"bonus tracks included\\" on it,  you will not get the full CD to include bonus songs.(6?) Some sellers were deceiving, FYI. If you don't care about getting the extra songs, go for the regular, easier to find CD titled \\"plus\\". It is the same fabulous CD, minus a few bonus tracks, obviously. Just a tid-bit.  :)

1780674880|4|The images in this book are cute.  However, they are printed on both sides.  You can get away with using water based markers in this book, because the paper is thick.  However, even with water based markers, dark greens will slightly show through.  Pencils work well in this book.  As much as I like the images, I probably would not purchase another like this, because I prefer to use my alcohol based markers and they definitely bleed through.  I'll share an image of the introduction page and the back of that page, to show how the alcohol based colors bled through.  Also, the back sides of an image that show slight bleed through (marks) from dark green water colored markers (I believe Pentel brand).  Other images will be mixed mediums- prismacolor pencils and water based markers (pentel, Le Plume II and Recollections).
B00AIQP9DE|4|Fun game. Some what easy to play and follow. Great clues that return fast ---not long time to wait.<br />Would recommend. Looking forward to a second game.
B00I8H6MGS|4|This movie gave new insights into the devastating HIV/Aids epidemic. Biases within the FDA and medical profession that prevented proper care of patients were dramatized sparingly. Performances were outstanding particularly by McConaughey and Leto. Despite buffering messages that interrupted my viewing I was deeply moved by this movie...an important statement about the disease and the medical web of checks and balances!
B0060CVE5C|5|I first read the book, then was excited beyond words to see the movie.  Both are great works and both are pure entertainment based on real life events.
B004S3MB2U|5|this is way better than the stock phone calculator.  It does so much more and I love it. (two words)
034580404X|5|I found this trilogy to be very entertaining. The second book was my favorite. I read the books a second time to find out what I missed the first time. The &#34;shock value&#34; prohibited my absorbtion of important information. I found the relations and the language a bit over the top, but a great read. Definately for a mature audiance!  I hope you enjoy, I look forward to other works by E L James.
B003E8P9G0|5|All I can say to Rick is O MY GOD(S)  First Percy Jackson (Also pretty darn awsome, by the way) and now THIS?  The guy is michlangelo with books!  Keep It Up Rick!!!
B0087HT36U|5|Great game. I have been addicted to this game ever since I got it. Can't put it down. Fun levels, not too hard, but a good challenge. Bring on the cowboys.
B001DTPZNY|5|Great!
B00BAXFECK|3|The main problem I have with this book is that it is a first person narrative by a young man (13 to 20-something) which sounds like the voice of a sophisticated woman.  What young man describes a woman by listing the designers of her various clothing items and shoes?  Theo uses terms like accessorize.  This from a straight man. This holds true for furniture, home decor,art, etc.  It is the voice of Donna Tartt and she is not convincing as Theo.
B00DURGZHW|3|It was okay but not my favorite Matthew McConaughey movie.
B008VBYN80|5|The game is very good like zoo tycoon. It also has a final fantacy battle effect, and even quests to do!
B0053JJLLC|4|Most of Crichton's books left you thinking there might be some reality there.  This book, however enjoyable to read, is completely Si-fi.  It starts out &#34;Crichton's&#34; but finishes &#34;Preston&#34;.
B003P2WO5E|5|Sanderson writes a tale about a six-year war; the aftereffects of the murder of a king by a mysterious assassin.  Brilliant storytelling.  I was on the edge of my seat (literally, because I listen to the audiobook while driving).  The characters are well developed--and not Mary Sue/Gary Stu archetypes.  Full of political intrigue, action, and plot twists and turns.  Some portions of the book were slow but helped with the world-building.  Highly recommend this novel.

6305972591|4|It's more eerie than spooky. but other than that it was a good movie and had a good story to it. i'd rent it before i bought it though. The one kid's voice gets on my nerves.
B0015AARJI|4|This controller works great but after a month or so the right stick thinks its being pushed left even thiugh it is perfectly upright. I think I may of been sent a faulty controller. I will ask Sony for a replacement.
B006VFLIYK|4|Very good read, action packed, never a dull moment. I will read more of his works. Reminds me of the tv show 24!
B004HWYTP4|5|bruce willis always entertaining supported by actors of world renown.  will definitely watch again when red 2 comes out.  you will definitely enjoy watching this movie
0345529057|5|I love this series! I discovered it after watching the show on HBO. I enjoy reading and these books keep you wanting more. I love the show and the books. I can't get enough!
B00E8KLWB4|4|Enjoyable game. The graphics are good,and the game is challenging,yet fun.
B00CWY76CC|5|This is NOT 100 doors!  It's awesome and I can't stop playing. Sometimes the levels are hard and sometimes easy. But still, a lot of fun. If your going to buy this game, you should be proud.
B0083P1QUM|5|First, I thoroughly enjoyed The Bone Bed.  Excellent writing by the medical examiner master herself, of whom I have been a steadfast and loyal fan for over 15 yrs.  However, this is reading for people who like to think, can handle big words, want to learn something perhaps...  In other words, this is not going to work for the 50 Shades of Filth.  But please!  Try it!<br /> Superb work, Patricia.  Thanks for persevering in these sad times!  Your fans are cheering you on!
B000002LK1|5|Definitely Depeche Mode's best CD and one of the best CD's ever.  Every song on Violator is fantastic and anyone who doesn't think this record deserves 5 stars is flat out wrong.
B00N1HONIO|5|very good and a little bit frightened.
0790737345|5|QUITE A TRAGIC MOVIE BUT IT MADE ME LAUGH, CRY AND REALISE THERE IS MORE TO LIFE THAN WHAT WE THINK.  SETH'S COMMENT OF &quot;I WOULD RATHER HAVE ONE BREATH OF HER HAIR, ONE KISS FROM HER MOUTH, ONE TOUCH OF HER HAND THAN  AN ETERNITY WITHOUT IT&quot; SAID IT ALL ABOUT TRUE LOVE . A TRULY  BEAUTIFUL MOVIE
1250027624|5|Received quickly.  Wonderful book filled with information about the series.  Thanks again!!
B003JYSEXY|5|Outstanding.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5|It's been a long time since a book has really changed the way I think about anything like this book has. It is full of revelations about a religion and a man that are so important & influential & done in a way that I really didn't want to put the book down. Each chapter was filled with important and relevant information about the man Jesus was and the environment he grew up in and his influences and his successors. It really changed the way i understand Christianity & it's founder. Really well done
B000002UTY|5|I used to listen to the LP version of Quicksilver Messenger Service Happy Trails while I was a cadet at West Point in the late 70s.  Much of the CD was recorded live at the Fillmore.  Includes the long version of Who Do You Love.
1449433251|5|AMAZING...!!!
B005USZYDU|5|How can anyone not like Grisham! you will enjoy it.
6305166021|5|This is a real treat for anyone who loves Celtic music and the rhythm it produces in their hearts.  Stunning collection of young talent; pure joy is reflected in the smiles of the performers.  For those of us who love Lord  of the Dance and wanted more . . . . this is it.  For the children in Irish  Dance who can't keep their feet still, Michael Flatley gives them hope that  this is something they have a future in something they love.  So those of  you who can't think of a gift, here it is.  All you have to do is wrap it  up.  I loved it and it really left me wishing it weren't only two hours  long.
B000IZ6URY|5|good
B004H4XI5O|5|Very intriguing study of memory and the competition to show the most proficient at memorization. It shows that memorization is not intelligence or experience but an Olympic style training event that with effort and practice can be accomplished by almost anyone. It also made me look inward at the way I learn and memorize things as opposed to things that I just remember for all of time.
B005HJWWW8|5|This is a MUST if you own the audio technica ath-m50x.  I also tried the higher end e11 and e12 and for the money this is hands down the best.  The other two products are WAY to big and and not needed for the m50x headphones.  This give the bass more of a punch and fullness.  If you listen to hip-hop and edm music you'll love it.
B0076DEJMO|4|Abercrombie builds this book on the characters of previous ones and brings in new ones that make us hope for future books. Some live, others die, others dissapear. You can never be sure who will survive, or who's time is over. Some scenes had excessive \\"Indiana Jones\\" parts to them, it seems a certain amount of pages had to be reached? That is why my review is only 4 stars. If Abercrombie left some of those out, he would be 5 stars every time. Not his best, but of the best you can find in fantasy writing these days. I strongly recommend it.
B001974DG0|5|Amazing book writing excellent one you do not want to put down, my favorite was the dog, sunshine
B00IKZX1ZI|5|frozen free fall is one of my best game on my kindle fire I love it so so so much
B003UESJ9M|5|I seem to be in a minority, but I thought this was a superb movie, a great start to 2011 (countering what Rebecca Murray said about the movie). Was it the greatest movie of all time? Not by a long shot, no. But it accomplished what it set out to do: it told a great story, showcased great performances both dramatically and musically.    While Paltrow may take first-billing, and while her musical numbers are phenomenal, to me it is Beau and Chiles (Hedlund and Meester) who this movie is really about.
B0034G4ORM|3|Why do all  technologically advanced and overwhelming alien armies always have a single point of failure that some scrappy team of humans can use to \\"take them down.\\"  All we have to do is push this button, or overload this reactor, or detonate this object, etc ... and the invasion is defeated. Star Wars, Independence Day, you name it, the story is almost always the same.  Can't we be more creative? Anyway, the point I'm getting to is that this movie is fairly predictable and follows a well-known storyline.  The same cookie-cutter characters are here.  The newly graduated commander who think he knows it all, the hardened vet, the plucky woman, the crying children that need saving, the two lifelong buddies (gee, I wonder if something will happen to one of them). The aliens come down in what are first thought be meteors... yeah that's original.        They tried to make this movie into a combat film, with lots of explosions, soldiers running for cover, bullets flying, etc.  I will give the film credit for trying to combine an urban combat film with  the alien invasions genre, but the film does not do great job a either. It's not a great war movie and its not a great alien film.      One of the more annoying things was that they used the handheld camera technique, often used in recent combat films, even before the action starts.  A character is in a florist shop buying flowers or two characters are talking in an office, and the camera is bobbing and swiftly panning around like they were filming some \\"run for cover\\" action scene.  Very annoying.    One of my tests for the quality of a movie is whether I find myself looking at the clock to see how much longer this will go on. . . with this film I did.  I'm glad I waited for online streaming version because I would have been dissappointed had I wasted time and money in the theatre. It's not a terrible movie, just not a very good one.   It's the typical, sub-par, summertime alien invasion movie, no more, no less.
B000I9WW6I|5|love seeing movies of times past, as in the story being told.  Kathy Bates was wonderful in this and the scene of her bashing the car in the parking lot - OMgosh, too funny- mainly because we all have been there and wanted to do just that!
B00KA87GCW|4|I was only able to play one day before the game refused to load due to technical difficulties (I have retried loading it at least a dozen times over a twelve hour period). It seemed to be a lot of fun, but it is frustrating to start a game and not be able to continue it. I rate this four or even five stars for fun, but the fact that it has so many technical issues reduces my rating to a two, and only the fact that it seems to work for some others prevents it being a one star rating, If I find a fix, I will return and bump up my rating. Update: Support for the game is very easy to access. That's worth  one extra star. Update 2: received an immediate response, and it loaded. However, it is still freezing up occasionally. They may fix it yet! I am very impressed with their support response (worth another star).
B003Y5HWJU|4|The shiw has its moments but sometimes it can be a little dull when you least expect it to be.
B00AFQC4QC|5|The thing with these books you get all sides of the stories.the Jewish people were horribly mistreated,but so we're a lot of different nationalities.it really a sad situation on all side.
B00J1IQUYM|5|A thoughtful and wonderful take on a post-apocalyptic theme.  You can't help but to keep turning the pages.  It's great to know a book can be written without the gore and horror so common to this genre.
B007HC3LHS|5|Kept you guessing.  When I put the book down, I couldn't wait to pick it up again and see what would happen next.
B0050PYNP8|4|I love this movie. Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Seth Rogen make the perfect team. This movie is hilarious and make me feel better about the alien film genre.
B00F91H15W|3|It was fun. Reminded me of Springbreakers. Kind of a cool story and can't believe it happened. Definitely worth a watch.
B005G4TJUC|5|Awesome Movie.
B00FCQQ1IW|5|Loved the book, as I did the two others in this series. He keeps you very interested and awaiting the next chapter with his way of wriing . Cannot wait for his next book next year.
0525478817|4|I love John Green and his novels, and this one did not let me down. It had wonderful characters, engaging plot and beautiful writing style. This book will make you laugh, cry and feel.
B000T9OP7G|5|this is great science fiction television. it expands on the films and gives us the story of what happened to our favorite character Sarah Connor. This is a short but great season and i cant wait for the full season 2 to air. if you like the terminator films, you will love this show.
B0000DD7LB|1|I just don't get it!  Is it the hype?  'Cmon is there any detectable vocal talent here? Sorry, but just can't find it on this album! Her voice is so achey on this album that it's painful to listen to, like ER at 2am.  Freaky! The farther you get into the album the more excruciating it becomes.  Hello Rhythm!  Are you home?  I am afraid to see what people look like dancing to this, seriously scary.  Too bad she learned nothing from Madonna except publicity stunts.  This pop is so flat that this album belongs with that open Pepsi sitting out for day (although tastes like years).  There are far better ways to waste your money.  So awful, it isn't worth the dust.
B000FC1MCS|4|The  world as experienced by an autistic 15 year old boy is explored in his own voice.<br /><br />Christopher finds his neighbor's dog impaled on garden fork and decides to solve the mystery of the murder.  Along the way we learn about Christopher and he learns some mysteries about his life.<br /><br />I found this book to be a fascinating (although I don't know how accurate) glimpse into the autistic mind.  Plus it was both an entertaining and easy read.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Easy to set up and streaming is so convienent!
B000YHG72E|5|I am generally not a Will Ferrell fan, as I prefer the good clean family-type movies.  Despite that, I very much enjoy this movie!  I have watched it many times.  It is cute, funny, has many quotable lines, and has a nice little story about family and love.  This is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  I would recommend watching it if you haven't already.
B00BATG18K|5|Amy Tan always delivers a great story.
0385344430|5|Ahhh, what can I say about Diana Gabaldon.  So far, I think she is truly a good writer.  Once, I read a Clive Cussler book and when finished I started one of Diana Gabaldon's books.  I told my husband there sure is a difference in the quality of writing - meaning that Ms. Gabaldon's books were of a far, far better quality of writing.  You get both romance and history.  I don't know what I will do if or when one or both of the characters die.  It will truly be a sad day.  I am ecstatic now that the first book, Outlander, is now being shown on Starz.  I had to subscribe just so I could see this series on film.  Thanks for the great novels, Diana.
B00688628M|5|One of best war movie series ever !!!
B00ICSVNOY|5|After watching this movie, I could not get it out of my mind or heart until I went to sleep that night.  I have seen some really disturbing movies but this one really hit me hard.  I have read and studied American History and watched other movies on the subject.  &#34;Roots&#34; was a lot like this except it was produced in the 70's.  This is what I fail to understand.....how can people (men and women alike) watch the atrocities that were carried out right in front of them (if they weren't the one who was afflicting the atrocity on another person) and say and do NOTHING???  The slaveowner's wives stood by and did NOT A THING in an attempt to stop the torturing, killing, and/or tearing families apart!!!  If this is humanity, then I guess I'm not human, because even watching these horrors occur in a movie causes me emotional pain.  I couldn't even begin to imagine seeing it in real time!!
B004LQ1XBY|5|Hugh Laurie is a musical genius, kind of guy you would love to have as a brother, so you can hang around him until eternity, or a day longer if possible, and never get bored...The only thing gets my spirit out of the gutter every morning on my way to work is when I turn on my CD player and Hugh sings to me \\"You dont know, you don't know my mind, when you see me laughing, Im laughing just to keep from cryin'\\" (Track # 2) Buy it, worth every penny :))
B003WJQ74E|5|Great book - purchased for English class for Junior but grandma read it too and liked it!  Probably more than he.!
B00EKGXA84|5|I first saw Walter when I was a child. When the advent of VHS came into being I searched until he became available. I identify with Mitty. When watching his life I'm taken to another place and time where life was more transparent and uncomplicated. Entertaining yes, but transporting for me. Danny Kaye is Walter Mitty. His characters have no equal in modern comedy. He represents a bygone era that I thoroughly enjoy therefore I have collected most of his films, fortunately on DVD. I would hope that future DVD's will include a more comprehensive &#34;making of&#34;, if it's possible.
0345525558|4|An interesting book.  I enjoyed it.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Beautifully written and quite engaging. Haven't looked up so many new vocabulary words since I read Moby Dick. Terrific read.
1452101248|5|This book is food porn for people who love cookbook photos as much as the actual recipes. I have eaten at Chef Ottolenghi's restaurants in London and he is a favorite of mine. The recipes are easy to do at home and most of the ingredients are easy to find or - if you are a decent home cook - just substitute. You get tons of ideas from this book! Plus... it's so lush to look at.<br /><br />Just as Oprah likes to give people gifts of her favorite things, I have bought multiple copies to give to friends who love to play in the kitchen.<br /><br />Signed - a foodie fan of Yotam Ottolenghi
B00BVYNSLC|4|Very interesting writing. . .
B004OCDLNS|2|Les Paul was understandably one of the best guitar players OF HIS TIME, but Jeff Beck is the best BEST guitar player of our time. He seemed to lower himself by playing this type of tunes!
B00000JPYD|5|Yeah, you hear how Trower's guitar playing is identical to Hendrix, well all I have to say to those people is get over it!!!! Trower is awsome and it shows it here on this album, and on the rest of his catalog. In This Place is still as trippy as the day it was recorded, Bridge of Sighs, brilliant. Lady Love, gorgeous. Go out and get this album, it's timeless, just like Jimi is too. Trower ROCK ON!!!!!
B0002ZYE1Y|1|This is one of those if your a collector like me you just have to purchase it to make the collection complete. I've been listening to Nightwish since Wishmater and fell in love with them. I have all their cd's. This is probly the most annoying cd that I have of them. I have all their cd's and most of their singles and I just can't listen to this thing except for a couple of songs. NEMO, I WISH I HAD AN ANGEL and PLANET HELL that's it. It was and is a pleasure to see them come to the states, I have seen them 3 times, ATLANTA, CHICAGO AND MINNEAPOLIS. Great shows, great songs, but awful new album. Please, I beg you please, to go back to Century Media you released some great albums with them and when you reunite with them, you'll release your greatest album('s) ever. On your next CD, have a duet with Tarja and Marcus.
B004GJDQT8|4|I would give you a 5 rating if you would start using PayPal. PayPal makes me feel safer than giving you my credit card numbers
B002MQYOFW|5|This book is very detailed and keeps you at the edge of your seat and is extremely hard to set down. Best series from books to movies also.
B009LXEBD4|5|I love Kelly Clarkson but I didn't own any of her albums, this is perfect for the regular fan, it has all of her great songs on it and I am excited for Chapter 2!

B002SAUCBC|5|Suspenseful psychological story of a walk in which only one person can survive.
1567184855|5|A very insightful book,...and comforting after a loved ones passing.  Journey Of The Souls sheds a new light on existence before having been born, after death, before birth, again and on and on.  An easy read.[[ASIN:1567184855 Journey of Souls: Case Studies of Life Between Lives]]
B0050DZ8J0|5|Good app!

0143036556|3|\\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" examined the environmental reasons for the collapses of various societies including the Mayan civilization in Mexico, the Vikings in Greenland, and the Polynesian societies on Easter Island, Pitcairn and Henderson Island, among other various societies. Not limited to examining failure, Diamond also provided explanations of the ways that societies recognized and avoided environmental collapse.  Examples of these successes include Japan at the time of Tokugawa and the New Guinea highlands.    Diamond arranged his examination of collapsing societies around the five stress points that cause societies to fail: Environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, loss of friendly trade partners, and a society's responses to its environmental problems. Any one, though usually two or more can cause a society to collapse. Obviously, the more problems a society has the more difficult it is to avoid collapse. (The presence of hostile neighbors, climate change, environmental damage and a poor response to environmental problems is usually a more dire situation than just the loss of a trading partner - though not always.)    For all the time spent citing examples from history, \\"Collapse\\" isn't just a collections of facts about the past. Diamond also provides up-to-date evidence of the problems we face now. He exposes our own society as no more permanent than that of the Maya.    Diamond finds evidence of the coming collapse of our society in Montana, which he examines extensively. Lack of water to grow food is one of the great causes of societal collapse and Diamond shows the problems the western U.S. is having supporting its population. He also points to the many other small 'first signs' of coming problems such as the rich insulating themselves in gated communities.    For all the dire examples, Diamond doesn't damn western society. He doesn't declare that we've already driven off the cliff of un-sustainability but he doesshow us that we're quickly racing towards it. His examinations of what worked in the past, what didn't work in the past, and what is going on right now, show that the most important 'point' out of the five is the response a society has to the new environmental pressures. If we can formulate the right response, there's no reason why our society shouldn't be among the list of civilizations that side-stepped collapse.
B001PPLIEG|4|The movie picks up right where the other one left off. It conveys a picture perfect portrayal of the James Bond that we all know and love. I truely enjoyed watching this movie and can't wait for another one.
0061733199|5|This book is truly a complete handbook. It has a boat load of information in it and lots of pictures. The pictures are in color where they matter and in back and white throughout the rest of the book. Detailed diagrams also are present. Tons of information inside this 550+ page book. It will take many hours to read it, but definitely one book to have and read it cover to cover multiple times and mark pages in it for quick reference. Tons of information that a lot of other books do not have and for the price, it is an excellent buy!
B00005N5S5|5|I remember watching Terminator the first time when i was really young and i really didn't understand what was happening.  Now that i'm older and the Special Edition Terminator is out.  I watched this movie last night and now it completed the whole story i was missing from Terminator 2.  Which I have watched a Million times.  Anyways. (...)
B006LSZECO|4|I have been waiting awhile for Gone Girl to come out in paperback so I could read it.  My expectations were high based on the reviews from friends and online.  The book has some good twists and definitely kept me interested, but I was very disappointed with the ending.  I would give it a shot if you are looking for a dark and twisty book.
B007ZGO7EM|5|If you don't need all the advanced functions in calculators, then this is a great one! And the price is perfect!
0345803493|3|This second novel in the Fifty Shades trilogy has all the making for a terrible book:  repetitive sex scenes with unbelievable amounts of reaching the big O, annoying interior monologue, one severely damaged character, Christian Grey, and one needy woman, Anastasia Steele. And oh, a twenty-something guy much so money can buy the moon if he so desired.<br /><br />All that said, I found it difficult to put the book down. I'd stay up late every night reading and had to drag myself to work every morning.  I think that is the sign of a good read.  Not all books have to be Pulitzer worthy to be enjoyable. I love the silly, edgy emails between Christian and Ana and would have loved to see more of this format.  It was entertaining (and yes, quite often frustrating) to follow this couple to see them kiss and make, kiss and make up.<br /><br />If you don't set your expectations too high with regards to literary value and you simply want to escape into the lives of more naughty, wealthy people, then give it a go.  Enjoy.<br /><br />Marie Estorge<br />author of STORKBITES: A MEMOIR and<br />CONFESSIONS OF A BI-POLAR MARDI GRAS QUEEN
B0089LOG02|5|Loved every minute of the book and was devastated when it ended.  I can't think of a better compliment to give any book.  Well worth the price.
B008XG1X18|5|Love Pinterest, can always depend on getting great ideas.

0920668372|4|. The back cover explains it as a “story of how a little boy goes through different stages of childhood and becomes a man . . . (and) about the enduring nature of parents’ love and how it crosses generations.”<br />I have to admit that I cried when he held her and he sang her song back to her.<br />I also have to admit that as I read the book some peculiar thoughts came to me, such as:<br />1.) Why does she have to &#34;(crawl) across the floor&#34; and peek &#34;over the side of his bed.&#34;<br />2.) This woman is freaky strong<br />3.) She has some serious stalker issues<br />Perhaps I’ve watched a few too many Asian horror films (Ju-on, The 2004 Thai Shutter, Ringu, Whispering Corridors, etc.) but if that was me as a child and/or youth and I wasn’t “really” asleep then having someone crawl across my room would seriously creep me out and give me nightmares.  Just imagine how scared that poor toddler was, he must have had terrible dreams all the time. And this happened night after night, after night.<br />Point number two became evident to me as I was reading the story.  I read it and thought to myself: “that woman is not just creepy, she is incredibly strong.”  Case in point, she was able to hold and rock her son, not just as a child, but as a teenager and even as a full grown adult.<br />Then, of course, there are her stalker issues. Not only did she terrorize him as a child and youth, but she continued her relentless fear attacks on him even when he was a full grown adult. Think about it, when he finally moved out she stalked him to his house across town, broke into his home, via his window, and continued here terror campaign against him.  The book even shows her driving with a ladder tied to the top of her vehicle so she could perpetrate her crime.<br />It was only later when I was washing some dishes that I realized what this book is actually about! Everyone thinks it is about a mother who loves her son for her whole life, but in truth it isn’t about that at all.<br /> Truthfully it is the story of a brave boy who has been terrorized his whole life, a boy who grew into a forgiving man who finally faced his dying tormentor and frankly forgave her. Sadly, as we turn the last page and read the words on it we see that the woman has won. We see that the boy, now a man, was unable to break the abuse cycle for there he stands holding an infant of his own singing the song of stalking terror.<br />Will I read this book to my son again, of course, but I just might add in a few of my own ideas as I read it to him. Mmmwwaa ha ha ha haaa!!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5|Great game
B005CRQ4GU|5|Very funny! I enjoyed it so much I read it 24/7 I got it yesterday and I finished it today! Can't wait for the next one!
B001TCHDPS|4|I like this because of the story of Rodriguez behind it.  It is very 70's music but it is good to me as I relate to that time.  I wanted to support this artist after watching Searching for Sugar Man.
B00AEJM6H2|5|I like the game because you stay interested in the speed at which you can complete a level! And each level is different so you can't cheat at any time.
B00B1LN8WY|5|LOVE THIS SERIES!  I had to purchase this when it went on amazon deals for 60$  Although it did not come with the book that was in the description.
0743579631|5|This is my favorite YA books series.  And what a wonderful job of reading it.  As it went along I almost forgot it was a girl reading it as each character seemed to have it's own voice and inflections - super super job of storytelling and I picked up little things I had missed in my four times of reading the book.
B00GTCECVG|5|Kaner88 hoping for a gem bonus
B001UTW7QU|5|I love Walter! All different personalities, each episode contains its own unique story without disconnecting from the long term story line.
B00003CWLE|5|How typical. Hollywood, or rather, the public has never embraced a film with a cohesive plot, and it doesn't surprise me that Anna &amp; the King, a film version of the popular musical, was a box office failure. Despite  the fact that it was overlooked in the big screen, Anna &amp; the King is  one of the best films I have seen in a while.<br />Jodie Foster's portrayal of  Anna is admirable -- I couldn't have chosen a better leading actress for  the role. Also, I enjoyed Chow Yon-Fat's performance as the king; he is  very gifted and charming. Foster and Yon-Fat have very strong chemistry,  although some people have said that they don't. I like the nineteenth  century backdrop of the film; it is done beautifully. I also like the  political and cultural issue -- I enjoy films with an intelligent dialogue.  I have never seen the musical, which means that I cannot make a  comparison.<br />As I've already mentioned, the public has never embraced an  intelligent film, which saddens me. If you're into artsy films, rent Anna  &amp; the King.
B00AA7O6QC|5|Great movie with lots of hilarious references to the actors' defining roles. Loved it, but not much that a movie that prissy girls would like that's for sure.
B007SGM084|5|I just can't get enough of the books. I even reread all 3 three of them. E.L.James did a fantastic job. As for M Grey....oulala who wouldn't want to be in  Ana's shoes. Chris may have 50 shades but he can surely teach  you 50 ways of pleasure :) Hope the movie will be as good as the books. I also hope that she will write about his relationship with Elena....I'm sure it will be interesting too ;)
B00CTNUMPO|5|It's Walt Disney!!!!  What's mot to love about it.  Great effects, animation and story.  Fun for all ages.  We have EVERY Walt Disney movies that has been released in our collection both in DVD and Blu-ray.
B000GGSMB2|4|When it first appeared in '83 a generation thought the romanticized, enobled vision of crime depicted in \\"The Godfather\\" saga was the standard for all mob movies. They didn't know how to take DePalma's stripped-down vision. It's interesting to see how a new generation has adopted this movie as a modern myth. The crime-life story of Tony Montana and his drive, rise and downfall is a stark contrast to the struggle to maintain the born-into crime-life of Michael Corleone. In this contrast it seems more viscerally real. DePalma, coming from his background of thriller/horror, was the perfect director to bring this quality to the crime genre. The movie's influence stretched long over the eighties into the nineties, and still continues. You can see it's impression from \\"Miami Vice\\" to \\"New Jack City. It's mythological deification has often been commented on in rap/hip-hop/gangsta' culture. I admire how it captured the \\"have it all\\" attitude of the eighties period (like \\"Risky Business\\",\\"Wall Street\\" and the somewhat earlier \\"Rocky\\" movies) and yet takes that to a fablic, cautionary extreme that's still relevant. Perhaps somewhere in the movie's rise to myth, it also has become romanticized, though in an extreme way, by it's more appreciative generation - and in that, it's made larger than what it is. It's appeal lies in that it is as direct, and as violent as we think crime is, so it's a great example of crime-movie as catharsis. In this way \\"Scarface\\" will rule it's crime-movie turf for some time to come.<br /><br />This DVD edition is my preferred one. While the most recent edition focused on the movie's rap/hip-hop/gangsta' cultural influence, this one focuses on the movie itself. A few things are carried over from the mid-nineties laserdisc release, while some of the other features are brand new. It's a great upgrade from the earliest video editions.
B008VVT51U|4|Nice movie for a date at home. The film moves a little slow which works fine for developing the characters. Relaxing, fun & thoughtful.
B0019NG73G|5|Gettysburg is indeed a war movie, but it is much, much more than a typical war movie.  Indeed, it is my very favorite movie, and I feel inexplicably drawn to the profound emotional pilgrimage of seeing it again every few years.  I relate to it on many levels, and I think you may too...    As a student of history, I am fascinated by how this one battle decided not only the fate of America, but had a huge impact on world history.  Can you imagine how very different Europe might be today if there were no undivided United States to come and help in WWI, WWII, or the Cold War?    As a fallible human, I am still astounded at how a relatively small error or two coupled with pride probably meant the difference in the battle, and hence world history.    As a moviegoer, I deeply appreciate how the movie maker was very careful for the details.  As those civil war buffs in the audience know, this is sacred ground, and I appreciate the care given to it by the movie makers.  Indeed, the movie used over 4000 civil war re-enacters as extras.    As a friend to others, I am deeply moved at how a trio of officers, close friends in the US Army for many years, all were drawn into this battle; when its effects were over, two would be dead and the third wounded.  And on the night before the climactic battle, two of them know the next day their units will be facing each other in battle, and are agonizing over it. Even after seeing it 6-7 times, I still cannot help but weep when one of the friends cries out to God for the fate of this trio near the end of the movie.    As a veteran, when a brave officer whose unit is out of ammunition orders a desperate charge, I shudder uncontrollably, and my only thought is \\"He did his duty.\\"  I am also fascinated by the variety of reasons the soldiers on both sides had for fighting in the war, which the movie wonderfully articulates.    As a citizen, I am very conflicted.  I am thankful that the union was preserved and slavery abolished.  But I shudder at how states rights were weakened; indeed, for decades now in my opinion the Tenth Amendment has been virtually ignored.    As a Christian, I find it fascinating and thought-provoking  how more overtly Christian officers and soldiers on both sides were, and am intrigued by Col. Chamberlain, a devout Christian.    As a student of culture and society, I am fascinated at the differences between southern and northern cultures and societies which are clearly depicted throughout the movie.  As a British military attaché so aptly observes, \\"Same land.  Same god.  Different dreams.  Very different dreams.\\"
1484707230|5|Got them early and my daughter was so psyched! They're excellent quality and packaging for shipping is great!
B00FAPF5U0|5|Highly addictive, fun game for those who love figuring out puzzles and strategies.  Free extra moves and lives can be given to (received from) Facebook friends.
B00FAX6XQC|4|I would recommend that you put in a bank option where your money doubles over time. I would also like the game to have cheaper gun price
B00005N5S5|5|I wanted to complete my Terminator collection so I found this copy of the original...  And it was a great price as well..

B007SYWFRM|5|It can be addictive but I love it! My son got me hooked. It's slow paced which is awesome. Sometimes it requires patience when waiting for the babies to hatch.
B008UCJ7KO|5|I can understand, it's a triology and now there is going to be 5 books. I love the realationship Eva and Gideon have. Such a good read. I can't wait till the next book. I recommend this book if you have read the 50 shades of grey books. Similar concept but honstley I like these books a little bit more.
B009JBZH54|5|Three epic Batman movies (5 discs total) for pretty much the price of a single blu-ray movie. It's a no brainer. Almost bought the first two as a bundle which came out to a cheap $25 (or so I thought). Once Dark Knight Rises comes out on blu-ray it will be $25 alone. $50 vs $30 (plus bonus content). Hmmmm? Of all movies that have come out or about to come out soon (Avengers 3D, Titanic 3D, Prometheus etc.) this is the best deal of them ALL on Amazon. I'm glad I held off on buying that two disc combo pack of the first two movies. Buy this. Buy this right now.

B000B8657S|5|Without trying to add to the discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the individual releases vs. the complete box set, I should like to point out that as of this writing (May 2009) these recordings are available on the Hyperion website for 25% and 55%, respectively, less than the Amazon price. The 37 individual disks come to GBP 390 and the box set is GBP 135. At the current exchange rate, this equals $620 (Amazon: c. $815) and $215 (Amazon: $480).    ADDITION (June 6): The individual CDs have subsequently been repackaged by Hyperion in standard jewel cases and several of them don't come with the full song-by-song notes any more.

045122499X|5|Ken Follett is a master craftman at telling stories.  I loved Pillars of the Earth, and World Without End does not disappoint.  It takes place in the same town as Pillars, but 200 years later.  It's not necessary to have read Pillars to enjoy World Without End.  Mr. Follett has apparently done his homework in terms of the details of life in the 1300s.  The novel contains much engineering, crafting, legal, political, and religious historical information that illustrates how this town functioned and how the characters relate to each other.  But there are also plenty of typical Middle Ages novel elements--romance, knights and damsels in distress, inquisition-like trials, plot twists galore.  I read it in 4 days!
B004CRR9G0|5|I have been looking for this movie for a long time. I finally have it and it is lots of fun to watch it.
B005GFPZYK|5|The 1st person descriptions by Chris of the events as they happen make the reading very hard to set the book down.<br />This is a must read for anyone interested in what Our Troops went through in that he'll hole!<br /><br />CHRIS is a true American!  He will be missed!
B00BAXFAOW|5|As all of Gladwell's writing, it make you think and think and think! Worth a read. You will not be disappointed.
B00006DEF9|5|This movie has it all! You will find yourself singing along,and tapping your feet through out the entire film.Not to mention a smile will be on your face from start to finish.This is one  Hollywood Masterpiece where ALL the actors are perfect for the roles they play. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor are absolutely flawless,not only in their dancing and acting, but in their comic<BR>deliverence  as well.As for Debbie Reynolds and Jean Hagen,how could we even imagine any other actresses playing their roles?<BR>The plot of the story is simple,yet keeps your attention from start to finish. Too bad musicals like this are a thing of the past.The quality of this film(sound,color,clearness etc.) is superb. You will definitely find yourself pushing&quot;PLAY&quot; again once this film is over.Don't be alarmed if after seeing this musical,you find yourself humming &quot;What A Glorious Feeling&quot; for days on end.Everyone needs this movie in their collection!!!
B000069AT7|5|E.T. is a wonderful movie. A perfect 80s movie for people of all ages. I've loved this movie since I was a kid and, watching it again, I got that warm feeling that I did back then. E.T. just puts you in a nice, comforting place that you don't want to leave. The gift set is just packed with a bunch of great stuff :  There's a book that has the entire script from the movie. There is also a frame of film from the movie. (pretty cool) The set includes the \\"walkie-talkie\\" cut from 2002 where they ruined the movie by putting cgi effects and removing the guns and replacing them with walkie-talkies. There is also the correct, original 1982 version, as well as a disc of incredible extras. The 20th anniversary soundtrack in also in the set. Perhaps the best extra in the set is the live soundtrack performance from the 2002 anniversary party/premiere of the movie, where John Williams conducted the score live over top of the movie.
B00CWY76CC|4|Works great on my Crystalview Android tablet. Can't wait for the next set of rooms...
B002SSUQFG|5|$50 for an automatic watch is a steal.  Especially if the watch in question is a Seiko.  It keeps great time, looks nice and holds a wind very well.  Leaving the watch in the drawer for a day is no issue as it is still running after 24 - 30 hours without fail.
B006SV2LWA|3|not as good as I thought. not one I would watch over and over.
0071766588|5|the best book to use for TOEFL preparation in my opinion, shortly, Recommend it!<br />Thank you ;)
B0094BB4TW|3|Its only ok.. the phone apps isn't as user friendly as the computer version
B007FG9LIE|5|Just finished Pines (Book 1).  Really enjoyed it and looking forward to Book 2!!  Kept me guessing and surprised by the ending.
B000P0J09M|5|This movie is a must have for any one who appreciates mob movies. Scorsese has such a great collection of films under his belt and this is top of the line as his others are. The acting, filming sequences and story are all wonderfully done.
B006IDG2T6|4|this short book adds little nuance over Sam's legally available talk on the subject available on youtube posted under the Skeptic Magazine account.  I don't want to per-empt Sam's argument here other to state that it is intelligent, considered, and worth reading/watching/listening to, but it's hardly bulletproof from either a descriptive or normative perspective.<br /><br />As has been pointed out, it's short work and shorter still if you get essentially the same information in the youtube video. Definitely worth watching as part of your journey of self-analysis.

B005NF2UE6|2|I put this cd - labeled \\"Here and Now\\" into my laptop.  It came up....\\"The Long Run\\" which is a previous album and all the songs are listed for THAT album.  When you play them, it is the music from \\"Here and Now\\".  This is messing with my media player!!!!!!  Love the music..... that is why it got two stars. Would like to know my options since this is a cd and an opened product??????
B00IS87HYI|5|Great fun and exciting.
B001EBYMB2|5|This movie is just grand, comedic yet an action flick for those who enjoy any war movie, be it anti-war or pro-war.
B007SGM084|5|I like the way the story flows.  It's hard to put down.  I didn't know you could put such things in writing for the General Public.  However, since I've read it several times, I really feel like I know the characters and want to be a part of their world.  The book is extraordinarily pleasing to me.  I highly recommend it to anyone under the age of 100.
1881273156|4|I bought this book for my significant other and me to read together. Since we have both been married before I thought this would help our relationship start off on the right foot. I think the information is so practical and sounds so simple, but often we don't think in terms of what our partner considers acts of love. We often give love as we like to receive it, not imagining that they may not feel the same way. It is a good way to begin a meaningful conversation.
B00D6BQPMM|3|A bit boring, but a good movie to have playing in the background if you're busy doing something else.
B00DPM7TIG|5|This was is one of the finest books I have ever read. It humanizes the horrors of war torn France through the lives of two young people.<br />It is a beautiful read.
B0091W6QZG|5|Good
B00AE2I4WK|3|The movie was really good. A lot of dancing which is nice to see. Quality of the movie not to much.
B00DURILJ2|4|Overall a great movie. Matthew does great job with this role. The kids I feel act our their roles well beyond their age. Good storyline. I felt like the ending was to easy to see that is the only reason it didn't get five stars.
B004HO6I4M|5|Great price and prompt delivery
B007MB5OCE|5|This was one of those really enjoyable books that gave me a few chuckles along the way. Cute sweet story.
031606792X|3|well, I must say im stuck in the middle with this book.  i started reading the twilight series early this summer when i stopped at a borders and found this at the display, and quickly went and bought the other 2 after i read twilight, and devoured the new moon and eclipse in 2 days, so i was uber excited when i knew breaking dawn was coming out in less than 2 months.  i was traveling so i got it on the road, and was soo happy to start reading, and after i finished, i wasnt as satisfied as i had hoped for.  At first, i hated the whole pregnancy, but then it grew on me i must admit, my biggest problem was that it was never explained as to how it was possible.  i read somewhere, if vampires cant cry how do they produce semen? I felt this was a big loophole.  I also hated how bella became a vampire, this actually is probably my biggest problem of the whole book.  i always imagined that it would be such a romantic scene, that bella and edward would be wrapped up in their love, and she would be like, yes its time. the whole turning into a vampire after almost dying from childbirth, truly disappointed me.  it was soo much better thinking that edward turned her into a vampire in twilight when he bit her, that would have been the perfect vampiric loving way to be turned.  But i did enjoy how much they enjoyed each other after she turned into a vampire, and they could finally be together, since apparantly edward was holding back all this time.    i also didnt mind her gift as others did, it made sense that she could find a way to ward vampire gifts with a sheild.  and i liked how at the end when putting edward under her shield edward could hear her thoughts  i also know ppl dont like that jacob imprinted on nessie, but i think stephanie prepared us for it by the other werewolf who imprinted on the baby in eclipse, so it went along with her story, and i liked how at the end edward called jacob son when jacob was to go away with nessie to save her from the volturi if it ended bad.  and i always knew they would end up happily ever after, this was a love story, while i dont like a few of the story details, them ending up as the happy couple is what was supposed to happen.  even harry potter ended up happily ever after, yes he had to give up a lot more to get that happily ever after, but u dont always have to have trajedy to acheive happiness. sometimes it does come as easily as it did for bella.  i just think she got the wrong stick as far as how she turned, it could have been soo much better of an experience i feel.
B00915G6MG|5|Great series
B0041D843M|5|Informative and life changing!
B004XJRQUQ|5|I read all three twice and was intranced both times. Very heartwarming and very exciting. Didnt quit reading until I was done with all of them.
B00OALBUZY|1|This was a gift, never knew the outcome.
B00A8ECU24|3|The plot and game play are alright.  Unfortunately, progression is painfully slow.  Especially if you are not willing to pay for the &quot;bits&quot; and crystals required to keep the story moving.  Not recommended for this reason.
B00E8KLWB4|3|fun game when it doesn't crash. It doesn't crash as often as it did, but still does on occasion.
B004ZMWUCU|5|I picked this book on a whim from the library. It is not the type of story I typically read. I was on vacation and finished a Ken Follett book. I had offered my kindle to my wife to read The Misremembered Man, but not having used the Kindle before she decided on a different avenue.<br />Anyway, what's important was that this was a wonderful, uplifting story whose subject matter is in part depressing.<br />The characters are well developed. \\"If only I could meet Rose or Paddy or even Jamie for goodness sake.\\"<br />That's how real they felt. Flying in from the east coast today I was really having a difficult time holding it together; meaning I was laughing so hard at the antics of these folks in the story.<br />This is a must read<br />Well done Christina McKenna and thanks for giving us this book
B001FB55YE|5|This is a great movie, on par with other great British movies such as Snatch and Lock Stock and Two smoking barrels. Truly a classic and a must own.
B00005JMCN|5|Gary Ross' SEABISCUIT is more than just a tale of a horse.  The movie is the story of three men who have lost much and gain much more through this determined horse.<br />Tobey Maguire, excellent as Red Pollard, has lost his family, eyesight in one eye, and eventually he is nearly crippled in a tragic accident.  His indomitable spirit, however, is recaptured by riding and loving Seabiscuit.<br />Jeff Bridges, outstanding as Howard, lost his son to a tragic auto accident, eventually his wife, and a lot of money during the great crash.  He marries a lovely girl (played quite well by Elizabeth Banks) and through Red and Seabiscuit, he too regains a life.<br />The excellent Chris Cooper is a cowboy who has lost his land....we see him touching a barbwired fence which imprisons what was once a cowboy's land.  His gentleness and his knowledge of horses catapults him into the spotlight, and he too regains his dignity.<br />The whole cast and the expert direction of Gary Ross gives SEABISCUIT a dramatic and entertaining lift; William H. Macy as Ticktock, the radio deejay, is fabulous and adds a lot of humor to his role.
B00BGIC2J2|5|This is a really funny movie,I would recommend renting or purchasing this movie,couldn't stop laughing...Me and my wife really loved it..
0385340575|5|Some time ago, I read Lee Child's Without Fail. I remember it as an exciting read, but it didn't cause me to seek another Child novel. Recently, I picked up Gone Tomorrow. Simply put, it's a great book.    If you're willing to accept the basic premise that a spellbinding adventure could flow from witnessing a woman (a complete stranger) kill herself on a New York subway, then the book makes sense. The hero, Jack Reacher, is a fortyish veteran of thirteen years' service as an MP officer. As an MP, he was engaged in special investigations all over the world. He developed first-rate fighting skills and marksmanship. Now, he wanders about on a limited budget confronting (and relishing) any dangerous challenge that comes his way.    Reacher is a sort of James Bond on the cheap. He stays in expensive hotel rooms at a steep discount by bribing maids and night clerks to let him in off the books. He takes a bus to get around. He'll walk to save bucks. He remembers where there's a cheap eatery with good food.    Reacher is also largely uncomfortable with today's technology. He describes himself as the only guy in America without a cell phone. He's unsure about how to play a DVD in a computer.     Gone Tomorrow centers on a search for a flash drive that contains a picture that may incriminate John Sansom, North Carolina Congressman and senatorial candidate. The picture was taken in Afghanistan in 1983 when Sansom met with what many consider to be the most evil man on the planet. Sansom, the DOD, FBI, Homeland Security, and a particulary vicious (but stunningly beautiful) terrorist, Lila Hoth, all want that picture in the worst possible way. Lila proves to be almost as cunning and resourceful as Reacher.    Child pays meticulous attention to detail. The story is set in Manhattan and Child shows a familiarity with the island and its people that could only come from tirelessly roaming the mean streets himself.    The book clearly reflects careful writing and editing. There are notypos, no awkward phrases. Not a single useless character.
1612183956|5|Awesome read!<br /><br />If you haven't started reading this series, I highly recommend for you to do so!
1451695195|5|\\"Proof of Heaven\\" is a fascinating account of an experience by a highly trained and experienced neurosurgeon , following an extremely serious near-death experience. The author's detailed account of his own medical condition provides highly significant support to his account. The description of the after-life experiences may be at variance with the beliefs of many but they are still well worth consideratiion and I highly recommend Dr Alexander's account for all readers!
B00BAXFECK|5|I could not put this book down. It was incredibly well written and very thought provoking. I learned a lot about the Goldfinch painting and restoring wooden antiques. Life as portrayed in this novel at times was very disturbing but none the less intriguing. I shall have to read her other books now. Glad to be introduced to her writing.
6304696515|5|I loved this film, it really is such fun to watch Close and Malkovich give career performances.  I am so perplexed as to how Glenn Close did not win best actress for this movie, she is absolutely fantastic, one of the best performances I have ever seen by an actress, Jody Foster won that year for The Accused, go figure. The acting is top notch across the board, with the exception of Keanu Reeves, but at least he looks good.  Malkovich looks like he is having so much fun with Valont and his peculiar quirks really work here, it is the perfect movie for this actor.  The ending is so well done and the last shot of Close is perfect.  The setting is stunning, the movie perfectly captures Ancient Regime France and the inner sanctum of the nobility.  All the debauchary and malicious gossip, is on grand display here and you can't take your eyes off of it.  Really a great movie.
B005IQZB14|4|Great book.  Not merely an \\"adventure\\" tome but a melodic discourse on grieving, introspection, and letting go.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys being In The Wild.
0061992860|5|Great for your EDC kit.
B005MLOKXA|5|This show has a little bit of everything.  There are so many entanglementts, it keeps you on your feet.  But, there is always some resolution at the end of each show....therefore, not a soap opera.
B002QE3CTY|5|I always have liked book versions better than movies because so much more can be conveyed.i think you'll enjoy this one!!
B002PMV9FG|1|OK, so you can't really make a movie too much like the book, not enought time, etc.  But it feels like they didn't really even try this time.  So many important parts of the book were just completely missing.  I understand cutting out things like the funeral.  This series is really going into a depressing area, and it really doesn't come out of it until the very end.  I think that JKR took a poor path when she darkened the story further than she really needed to.  But this movies bent even further in that direction with pretty much the entire production soaked in sepia toned depression, and the morose tone overshadowing the few remaining exciting parts.  I would not reccommend that anyone buy this movie.  Staring at a wall is less depressing.
B0069G5Z9K|5|An extremely well made game!  Every aspect of it seems to be well thought out, and inspired.  I can't, nor do I want, to quit playing!  I was jealous when my Daughter showed me this game on her iPod touch.  Thank you for bringing it to Android.
1400031354|5|Big fan of Alexander McCall Smith and his writing! He brings you to a place of relaxation with a witty style. I love this series and the characters. Also, if you like to drink tea, these are the books for you!

B007IXWKUK|3|The book was ok...I don't have a whole lot to say. It appeared to be a book on porn. That's about it.
B000063CMK|5|<br />\\"We will always be so much more human than we wish to be....\\" <br /> <br />Pain of Salvation.  <br /> <br />This band is my favorite ever.  <br /> <br />I'm sorry to resort to hyperbole, but no band has ever had such a powerful emotional draw for me, and Remedy Lane is a perfect example of these powerful emotions that PoS evokes so wonderfully. While I do feel that The Perfect Element pt. I is their best album as a whole, I think many of the individual songs on Remedy Lane stand out strongly. I NEVER tire of listening to this album, and even the songs that initially sounded strange because of the polyrythms sound \\"just right\\" to me now.  <br /> <br />It certainly helps that Daniel Gildenlow is also one of my favorite vocalists ever. Many people say he is over the top or something, but that's how I like my singers to be: theatrical, dramatic, evocative, versatile...there are so many times where his voice both lifts me uup and drowns me in intense pain. That moment in \\"Trace of Blood\\" where he mournfully wails, \\"too late we learned!\\" just breaks my heart every time. And there is of course the amazing \\"Undertow\\" that just builds and builds, and Fandango is one of the strangest but most interesting songs, and \\"Beyond the Pale\\" still gives me chills... \\"its just another small thorn in my crown/ Then suddenly one day there was too much blood in my eyes/ and I had to take this walk down Remedy Lane of whys and whys..... <br /> <br />Pain of Salvation.  <br /> <br />Watch them dance down the Remedy Lane and let the Undertow sweep you away....
B008XCF7Y6|2|Not nearly as good as the previous films. Would have been better with live actors instead of just their voices.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Very mind challenging. Gotta have good eyesight to be able to find some of the items. I would recommend this game.
B00HZ6GSVC|3|I really enjoyed the last album. This one, however, seems pretty bland in comparison. Oh well, maybe it will grow on me as I listen more. James Mercer has a fantastic voice, though, and his work with The Shins really shines.
6300214354|5|I am usually not interested in the low comedies (farces, parodies, slapstick, etc.) and rather I enjoy witty satirical humor much more.  However, this movie was an exception--this is Val Kilmer at his best, and had me laughing the rest of the night.
B00B2V66VS|5|Have a little trouble in the mine cart and grabbing power -ups on hills.  Otherwise, really really enjoy this &quot;2&quot; more than any other.
B00D7DTRWY|3|Seems like Zakk is running out of gas.  This is pretty average after the opening track.  Hope he gets his muse back for the next CD.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|A good read. Interesting the way the author connects the characters - also how we react to moral situations. Excellent and thoughtful!!
B004EF8AJA|5|Although when you see the title of the program, you think that this has to do with another version of the original.<br />Which in a sense it does, but this program deals with the differences between those who live in the south of England, as  to those in the North, whose opinions are quite different.
B008Z9YGEE|4|Was a good a good movie, expected more because of all the hype. Great movie to watch with family preteen and over.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I never cry reading a book, but this one did it for me. Really makes you reflect on everything in your life and the choices we make or could make because every day is a gift.
B00715RI16|3|I know all scarey movies are a little weird, but this one was just weird.  It didn't make much sense, and there was just too much NOTHING going on for long periods of time.
B007URVZJ6|4|This guide gives you everything you need to know to format your book for Kindle.  The only reason I've given it four stars is because you can get the same information on the Amazon website, and I found it easier to refer to it on the website while formatting, rather than trying to juggle my Kindle and my computer.
1476727651|5|Review of Dr. Sleep by Stephen King<br /><br /> Stephen King proves once again that he is still at the top of his grisly game.  In the 36 years since The Shining’s debut many readers have wondered what had become of Danny Torrence, that adorable kid with the special shine.  King delivers that and more in the sequel to The Shining, aptly titled Doctor Sleep.  Daniel Torrence is all grown up in this horror masterpiece, and he shines like never before.  All of the suspense and dark humor King is famous for keeps the reader turning the pages and horror hounds who follow the genre will love the nod he gives to son Joe Hill’s creepy tome, NOS4A2.  Fans of The Shining will love how King revisits many of the minute details that made The Shining such a hair raising thriller.  If you have never read The Shining, never fear my fright loving friends, Doctor Sleep is a novel unto itself, weaving a story that will chill and delight in equal measure, proving King is just that, the king of horror.
B002M5E2DW|5|I really liked this book. It helped me feel like I had control of my destiny. It helped my self extreme.
B00BD99JMW|5|Loved the series, still not sure how I feel about the ending.
B0014VPFTA|5|We were not fans until we saw him on the Crossroads concert. We loved the song gravity so this was purchased for Xmas. It has been a pleasure to enjoy his music and talent.
B00A8V3VVG|4|In the movie, they played part of Ritchie Havens' version of Freedom, yet its not on this CD. Why not?
B00867GJYK|5|Purchased as a gift, came as I expected. Would highly recommend movie and adding this film to your movie collection.
B0043JDUNS|2|The movie is great as I've seen it three times previously. Problem with this rental is the quality was terrible.  Very pixelated. Dark in a lot if scenes. We turned it off after an hour. Ill be requesting a credit.
B001BANK32|5|Great Book!!!  Stephen King is just that!  The KING of Horror and Suspense.  His characters come alive because his character development is deeply detailed.  A person is able to &#34;get inside the mind of the character&#34; and know his or her motivations and prejudices and fears.  The Shining is a true page turner, because the reader is truly invested each character's emotional pulls and the resulting chaos, of which there is an abundance.  There are many paranormal aspects to this novel.
B00Y6QF0PE|3|Recap of what we already read
B00I2TV3NO|5|Nice and interesting good quality
B0084BMUFA|5|I really enjoyed this book. Even as adult I think it's well worth a listen. Great Book and a great narrative

B0086700CM|4|I LOVE it.! Its so addicting.! Except sometimes it glitches and wont allow me to turn, or when I turn it jumps instead
B00DHHWXYY|3|I ordered a new movie and got a damaged case, clearly not new.
1441866868|4|This is a review for the audio book version, so I am going to break it down into three parts:  Writing, Performance, and Technical.<br /><br />First, the story.  The Windup Girl is a great post-apocalyptic novel about a world where genetic manipulation has backfired into plagues that have almost wiped out the human race and much of the natural world.  Bacigalupi has painstakingly created a vocabulary for this culture with words that sound realistic and technical like Sibiscosis, ivory beetle, gene-rippers, kink-spring and so-on.  This adds a rich texture to the story that makes you feel like you're there.  The characters are multi-layered.  Heroes become villains.  Villains become heroes.  He does a very good job and giving each character distinctive qualities that go beyond looks and mannerisms--we feel their motivations.  Having heard the book, I now want to read it so that I can see the spellings of the names and the terms.  Overall a great companion to other books in the genre.  If you like Dune, Oryx and Crake, and 1984, you will likely love this book.<br /><br />Second, the performance.  Jonathan Davis is GENIUS.  He was so good that I have a difficult time distinguishing if the book was actually that good, or if it was his performance that brought the characters so much to life.  Every character had it's own voice that varied just slightly from his normal speaking voice.  They were unique, but not annoying.  His pronunciation was clear, and his timing was perfect for drawing out suspense.  His dialogue had the cadence of a real conversation.  If I could give the performance section of this audio book 6 stars I would.  It is worth buying the book just to listen to Davis read.<br /><br />Finally the technical.  The authoring of this CD collection is bizarre.  There are 16 discs with at total if 1,584 tracks.  Importing it into iTunes is a nightmare, and then keeping track of where you are is just plain weird.  Chapter breaks can be found in the middle of tracks.  Chapter 2 starts in the middle of track 97.  Chapter 3 starts in the middle of track 59.  The discs end in the middle of chapters with an annoying voice that says, \\"This is the end of disc number...please continue listening on disc number...\\".  Every other audio book that I've heard has the tracks broken up by chapter.<br /><br />A piece of advice, so that you don't end up with 1,584 individual tracks:  When importing into iTunes, follow these instructions:<br />Stick the disc in your computer<br />When asked if you would like to import, click \\"no\\"<br />Select all the tracks on the disc<br />Go to \\"Advanced\\" in the menu bar<br />Select \\"Join CD tracks\\"<br />Then click import CD.<br /><br />In this way you will only end up with 16 hour long tracks.  The chapter breaks will still be lost in the middle, but your library will stay more organized.<br /><br />Overall, a great story, and a great performance.  Definitely worth a listen if you don't mind the weird technical presentation.he middle of track 97.  Chapter 3 starts in the middle of track 59.  The discs end in the middle of chapters with an annoying voice that says, \\"This is the end of disc number...please continue listening on disc number...\\".  Every other audio book that I've heard has the tracks broken up by chapter.

Overall, a great story, and a great performance.  Definitely worth a listen if you don't mind the weird technical presentation.
B006BGZJJ4|3|The first one disintegrated, Kindle send me another one hope this one stays intact. It happens the same with the one my wife has
B00FAPF5U0|5|I started playing on Facebook. Fell in love with this game. I'm so excited that it is finally out for the kindle fire. It is a fun game to pass the time
B0091XT22O|5|I have seen this movie many times and I've never grown tired of watching it!
B001N1DPDE|5|This is one tough knife.. a bit heavier than i expected but it is very rugged.  The plastic case is also well constructed.  I was concerned the blade was too short but not so... the knife is big enough to do the job.
B000059H99|5|&quot;Rocky&quot; is one of the great classic films that stands the test of time. This is an original, entertaining and captivating movie. Instead of using large, complex brushstrokes, it makes a great story out of ordinary people. Sylvester Stallone gives a great performance as Rocky, he's not some brute tough-guy, he's just a nice guy who is suddenly given a big chance at his sport. The screenplay by Stallone is an authentic and intriguing journey into the world of boxing, and the side storylines do not interrupt the film's structure but flow along with it. There is also sweet, uplifting romance with the story of Rocky and Adrian (played by Talia Shire, sister of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola). The boxing scenes are exhilarating and exciting, especially the final boxing climax at the end. Overall, &quot;Rocky&quot; is an inspiring movie because it gives hope that people can get a chance at big things, that we can strive for more, and if we work hard and use our minds, we can excell. &quot;Rocky&quot; seems simple, but has strong things to say at its core. It is one of the great sports films, but also a great drama and romance. It is classic filmmaking done with style, focus and energy.
B008Y2X78S|5|Awesome but my favorite is Glades& Bosch
0780622642|5|U2: \\"Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a theif.\\"<br />Once again Dr. frankenstein retuns to the grave yeard insearch of a coprpse to reanimate.  Get a hint, the brian is Abby Normal.  get It?<br />Thif film is the cyber-grunge rewrite of a pretty good tv series, but it is too dark.  My law: The quality of the special effects is inversly proportial to the quality of the script.<br />Thire is a way to salvage this movie, and that is by making it a little happiere, instead of somw twisted iron maden.
B007SGM084|5|amazing book!
B003QS67F0|5|I had never heard of it and was quite surprised how good it is!
B002OF5KWM|5|Provided great insight into the world of club kids that flourished during the nineties. Culkin gave a great performance as Michael Alig. Overall a very good movie!
B00WSD2BGS|4|Super cute. Even my toddler sat and watched it and enjoyed the humor.
B00ADIT8U2|5|really enjoyed playing this game. lots of fun. it's not too difficult,  but engaging. graphics are lifelike and the story is interesting.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Highly addictive game, makes me hungry for candy all the time.  If you have a low threshold for addiction to fun games, stay away!
B00CRWJ5GO|1|This movie is the worst movie I ever watched. I watched all two plus hours and it never got any better. Do not waste your time or m
B00AFQC4QC|5|I greatly enjoyed this novel.  Every evening, I would look forward to picking up the book and seeing what would happen next.  It's a good story and well written.<br />note: I d/l this novel for free.<br />note to author: reigns s/b reins and in one instance &#34;off&#34; s/b of.  Otherwise, a wonderful job.
B000ZMVAXO|3|I bought this after having looked at pretty much every available \\"headphone\\" amp out there.  Since no local shop has anything decent I had to go by internet reviews.  I wanted something around the $50 range...I already have a $300 effects pedal I can use to practice with if I wish, but I wanted something simple for when I just want to pick up my bedroom guitar.  Based on other reviews I chose this.  I tend to either play metal, or acoustic...I don't dig blues or effects heavy pop stuff.    The first thing I noticed when plugging it in is that there was a distinct \\"crackle\\" when doing palm mutes.  My review lost a star right there.  I mean, come on...it's the METAL version of this headphone amp...palm mutes are one of the cornerstone of metal.  I tried using a different guitar and different headphones...the headphones I first used were $50 ones, the next pair were $80 ones and finally some cheepo earbud types.  The crackle was not coming from the headphones, and you tend not to notice it with cheapo ones.  The guitars themselves were high end guitars with EMG and Seymour Duncan pickups.  It was obvious the weak link in the chain was the Amplug.  turning down the volume slightly helped. I know it's a $40 \\"amp\\" but come on, it's METAL...it should be turned up to 11 all the time.    The other reason I took off a star is because there is no \\"clean\\" channel on it.  I knew this before buying it, and I know how to take it apart and modify it so I can get a clean sound through it, but still...it would be a SIMPLE thing to engineer into this amp.  Every single other headphone amp I've used over the years has at least a clean channel.  This is lame lame lame.  How are you supposed to play something like \\"Fade to Black\\"???  I know they're trying to sell more of these single sound Amplugs, but if you buy the clean sound one it's another $40, and you're now pushing $100...the territory where you can buy a cheep effects pedal with other effects built in.  If I didn't know I couldmod this myself by changing a resistor and re-wireing it to a trimpot, I would NOT have bought it.  They would have lost a sale.    Bottom line; if I had tried this at a local shop, I don't think I would have bought it.  The lack of a clean channel is annoying, and the crackling would be a deal breaker for me.  Still, it's OKay for $40.  Just OKay.  The actual distortion sounds good, when you're not palm muting >eye roll< I'll give it a week or two and I may still return it.
B00F3OLVR4|5|I am divided whether to give this album a 4 or 5 star rating. This album is a great album, but I don't think it's perfect. I think it's a great album and what fans have been looking for from them since the early 90's. This album is like a cross between and justice for all and the black album. It has a lot of really solid songs, guitar riffs and solo's. My favorite song on here is All Nightmare Long. I think the album ends better than it begins, but overall a very nice release by Metallica and it showed that they put in a lot of work on this one.
B009U9S6FI|5|People who survived the &#34;camps&#34; have always fascinated me. Such a victory of human will!<br />I bought this as a Kindle and then purchased a &#34;paper&#34; copy so that my (adult) children could read  it.
1101946342|1|A real disappointment. After reading three books of Grey, there was nothing revealed about Christian's character that the reader did not already know. If this would have been book one, I never would have read the series.
B006LSZECO|5|This was a great read, and it kept me interested from start to finish. I did not want to put it down!
B00A6PD9I4|5|It was a good movie for all ages. Very funny and entertaining. I would recommend watching it.  Hope you enjoy it to.
0425152251|5|You can always find huge books about philosophy and after a few pages you're totally lost, and have to start over again several times. But this one is different. Jostein Gaarder has sold this book all over the world, and I can see why!!<BR>I first started to read this book when I was 15 years old, and to be honest I found it boring and gave up after a few chapters. But having read it again now, 4 years later, I have a completely different view on the book. It's not hard to read and you can easily follow young Sophie's ways of thinking. To some point her ways of thinking can be reflected in your ways of thinking. Trying to understand who you are, where you're from and other ancient philosophical questions. Seeing the different aspects of thinking makes you start to think yourself.<BR>I would recommend this to anyone older than 18. And espesially to those you want to learn something about philosophy without starting on books with a difficult language and content. And most important, all history of philosophy gathered in one place, to give you an easy overview on it. I had read this book before studying a semester of Philosophy, and it made the studies a lot easier! It's really worth to read, and you won't be disappointed.
B00BUCXVPI|2|Poor story, poorly presented, with poor acting. This is a disappointment for Cruise fans. Save yourself the trouble of watching.
B004GYY714|5|Love this program,  specifically like the simple podcasts access.  Radio is broken in one of the vehicles and this is great option until I can get it repaired.  One problem, I cannot figure out how to turn it off on my android phone other than setting it to timeout.
B00G32TD98|5|Easy buy. I accidentally ordeded the standard viewing addition, contacted Amazon, and they swapped them out at no extra cost. I don't quite know if I liked the movie or not but I do know that it was much better than some of the ones out there.
B005USZML4|3|Easy read but very simple
B00RHYBEIY|5|Brilliant Neal Morse continues to please with his progressive work..........the guy would have to work real hard to make a lousy album.  Christian music is overall bland in nature......like listening to the top 40. Morse takes it to an level never seen in the Christian music genre.  Go see him live if you can!  Come to Austin Neal.
B0036S4C6G|5|Fantastic story, well written!  The way the writer wove the history of the characters from the past to present was amazing.
B007PTJOV0|5|Very fun and easy just like playing mario bros. Love it completely recommend it.plus it is free so it's a win win.
044024238X|4|This book, like her others, had me laughing out loud and falling in love with the main characters! Definitely recommend if you like her other novels!
B00IKZX1ZI|5|great fun game.  I wish we could play. for. more than five times and not have to wait for lives to build up again.  I distill like this and Maleficent.  I wish there were more games like these.
B00M1IH15Q|5|Fantastic!!! I have been a long time BSB fan, also enjoying the many solo albums the guys have release. This one is will not disappoint! Nick sounds great with Jordan Knight. Their voices mesh really well together. Great sound, great vibe, definitely something you can get up and move to!
B00DR0PDNE|1|RECENT: JAN 7, 2014; GLADLY one (the 2 returned keyboards)  (single, just only 1) ITEM has been returned as of right now..but please tell me,WHAT about all the OTHERS? They were all returned in ONE UPS PACKAGE!!?? ANd one of them is this GOOGLE CHROMECAST Streaming Media Player...??
B00KNWYDU8|5|This is a fantastic game. You can battle others, take care of dragons, evolve them into amazing dragons like never before seen, and more exciting things in Dragon city.<br />:-)
B004MC8CA2|5|This app is perfect. It does everything you think and do much more. In addition to that it's free. I love the different versions and the plans.
B005K17RU0|5|I find great functionality in this ability to get nearly instant access to the best source of weather data for planning my day and the week ahead.
B008NF45S2|5|I love how easy it was to install for me not really being a techy person.  It's great to print from my phone instead of turning my labtop on just to print something.
B00000099Y|5|aenema by tool is a brillant album that breaks the standart boring metal album stigma. each song takes u on a rollercoaster of emtions. MJK (the vocals behind tool) has a wide range of vocal abilties, each of them can be  heard and cried for in the moon. Adam Jones has a speical view over the  world and writes it in the most touching way. in the album there are a few  songs that stand out - stinkfist landscapes synth-guitar strumed riffs with  a melloncolic text, 46&amp;2 reveals excellant guitar solos and amzing  vocals again, and my fave jimmy - ever so sad.<br />if u want good music don't  listen to tool. if u want a perfect theme for a moody amrmagedon own it!
0061339202|5|I needed this book for class. Personally I would not read this on my own time, but it wasn't terrible.
0374531269|5|After reading this book, I am a different person. I am a Kindergarten Montessori Teacher and when I see my students outside on the playground, playing and pretending to shoot each other, I am given a heart-wrenching reminder that this sort of play is not all fun and games. I no longer tell my students the simple &#34;We don't play guns at school&#34;. I am deeply affected, almost to the point of tears when I start a very real conversation with them about guns, what they are used for, and why they should not pretend to engage in this sort of activity. I even tell them that in other countries, such as Sierra Leone, young boys even would have real guns. I emphasize it is REAL, and not just pretend in other places. All children should be aware of the reality behind the concept of play shooting each other. I engaged in this play myself as a child, but will never have the same perspective again. It honestly disturbs me now when I see young children laughing and pretending to kill each other. I think to myself, what a sad place it is in America to be oblivious to the reality of such things outside this country and encourage your children it is just pretend when it is reality for some.
B00CWY76CC|5|This app challenges people of all ages and stimulates them without them even knowing!This app is a mix between a puzzle and a Escape.Its more or less, a less scary and difficult version of Saw.Very much recommend this app!
B00101ZOTA|5|Too good for words!!! I love this film!
B00H71PBQ8|5|Fabulous writing, wonderful acting and the costumes are to die for!
B000W4D94I|5|My grandson had rented the DVD and when I saw the quality of the blue ray over the regular DVD, I was amazed.  It is an old movie so I was really delighted to find it available.
0316069515|5|Story a little complex, interesting as usual though. Just gotta stay focused to what you are reading to keep up with the story line.
0691152640|5|Rogoff and Reinhardt do a comnplete job in assembling the history of modern governments and how they always fail to treat economics as an emperical science instead of an etherial religion. You cannot spend what you do not have, PERIOD!  Most of the legislators in Washington should be tried in court as traitors.
B00UPSUYU8|5|I like it all
B005ZOBNOI|5|The book is great. Could not put it down
B000B8QG4A|5|Excellent DVD!!
B0063IH60K|4|lots of fun though why you have a setting that you win each time you play that does not appeal to me over all great game
B00P7PK6JS|5|Great Movie!
B00127RAJY|5|Just finished day 4, and really like this workout. Although I am only on level 1, I feel it's helping my long distance running.
B00005JKGK|3|I loved this book when I read it.  The movie had less appeal.  I watched it with some people who had not read the book first.  They found the plot and the characters confusing.  The movie skips quickly from mother to daughter, present to past, and from one mother/daughter set to another.  For people who didn't read the book, this can become a little confusing.  That said, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to Amy Tan fans.
0465043577|5|This book should be required reading for all of Wall Street's money managers. It would have saved billions of their clients' money.<br /><br />Let's look at the Long Term Capital disaster. Intelligent people, Nobel laureates, so what went wrong? The answer is simple: fat tails! (The concept that supposedly one-in-a-billion events are, in fact, not unusual). Clearly, it was not lack of intelligence that caused their downfall, but a childish reliance on flawed financial theories.<br /><br />Mandelbrot identifies and explains the flaws. True, he does not provide an alternative theory, but perhaps the whole point is that financial markets, being chaotic systems, are not predictable.<br /><br />Let's look at another chaotic system, the weather. Here the parameters such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, are easily measurable. Yet, we still cannot predict the weather accurately for more than a day or two. How then can the stock market, which is far more complex than the weather, be predictable, when most of the parameters that affect it are not measurable, and some are not even known?<br /><br />Perhaps the weakest part of the book is the beginning of a theory that Mandelbrot tries to found. He suggests that fractal equations produce charts that look and feel like real stock price charts, and that there might be some connection that can be exploited to predict or describe financial markets. He does not, however, go beyond this suggestion and hopes that someone else would develop his theory.<br /><br />Bottom line: Mandelbrot's \\"fat tail\\" theory explains the financial disasters suffered by many \\"brilliant\\" money managers. It does not predict the market, but explains the risks of conventional capital market theories. It saves you money, and after all a penny saved is a dollar earned.
B009LMTDL0|5|This book was given to me by the CEO of my company. It is nicely written and full of interesting facts that it was hard to put down. I am happy and appalled by some of the truths of women in the workforce. I feel empowered and aware of what I want to accomplish in my life for career and family.
B001NHNG64|4|Good read. Easy. No mystery. Finished in a few hours.  Typical jack and girl story with home based terror doom.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5|After getting hooked on series one, I couldn't wait for series two! It is incredibly rare to follow something like Downton series one and best it. With all of the drama from the Great War and the changes that were happening the society, this period is ripe with drama and intrigue.<br /><br />I can only count a few instances in my life where TV or a movie has had me rendered immobile and on the edge of my seat, but the last few minutes of the Christmas special did just that.
1455510319|5|If you enjoy good court-room give/take, unpredictable plot twists, and fast-paced writing, you'll enjoy this one.  The reader of the audio version is excellent.  I don't understand the number of negative reviews -- almost didn't read it, but I'm glad I didn't.  That said, I should add that I've read only 4-5 of Michael Connnelly's books.  I'll definitely look for others.
B004DLPXAO|1|I totally regret this update. It's been a nightmare and rendered the app useless on my android. The update was 4/13/14.
1250038820|5|I love it. I bought it for my friend as a birthday gift and had second though whether to give it or leave for myself :))) Keep up the good work Brendon! With love from Tbilisi, Georgia
B00632HWOG|2|It works pretty well, with these exceptions.  First, the access to the mailbox contacts doesn't work at all.  Second, when opening an attached document, the navigation arrows disappear completely and you're forced to shut the device off to escape.  Third, when you delete an email, the image sticks around instead of disappearing.<br /><br />Summary, a good start but needs refinement.
B00K5M19XA|4|I saw this before reading the comics, so naturally I thought it was good. But the comics was so well written that I absolutely changed my mind about this movie.  I agree with the other reviewers about some inconsistencies like when Damian got stabbed in the arms, but it didn't affect him.  Anyway, it was entertaining nonetheless.
B0013D8LKO|5|Great.
B003JHKORK|5|Great movie, we have watched it numerous times!
B00CRS5HII|5|Love every cut. Beautifully recorded. One on the best voices in country music today!! So happy I purchased it!! Happy, happy, happy!!!!!
0441172717|1|This version is over 900 pages long, but it might be necessary for readers who can't see well. I can't imagine how someone could read this version without splitting the binding. I don't know what publisher thought it would be a good idea to make a paperback in these dimensions.<br /><br />I sent it back as soon as I actually saw it and replaced it with the version I originally read - Dune Mass Market Paperback – November 1, 1984, ISBN-10: 0425080021, ISBN-13: 978-0425080023, which is only 536 pages.<br /><br />The book itself is a great book, but this version is not something I would recommend unless you have special circumstances.
B000J4QWMC|2|First of all, please don't waste your money buying it. I'd wait till it hits cable. The movie was very dark, and nothing like the television show(that it was inspired from?). If you're looking for what was so cool about the show, you won't find it in the film. I'll give it 2 stars at best.
B00DSY8D36|5|Super
B008XG1X18|5|Since I found pinteres I don't have time for face book are anything...I get started and my husband has to remind me what time it is...lol
B00IVDXAN2|3|Super cute but glitter everywhere!! All over my couch and even after several vacuums it is still there! Open up the box outside and air them out first. My LO is 4 years old and they are a little big on her but they work.
B000SGGUWS|5|Awesome book! Watch out because you might just get hooked!
B0013FDM7E|5|MAKES  YOU  NOT WANT TO  RECIEVE  ANY SHOTS  (  of  any-kind )  !!!
B000002AGN|5|love the mucis
B00AQ3K8IU|4|Overall the book is entertaining I did not anticipate the outcome. It is clearly a book for teenagers, although I am not one, I enjoyed it anyway. It does have a few sex scenes that might not be proper for young readers.
B0049P1VHS|5|LOVE, LOVE LOVE each and every season, can't wait for season 3 & 4 on DVD. Each season keeps you on the edge of your chair. What if this is in our future, how would you survive?
B000FC1JAI|5|I bought the print version, which was quite convenient to flip through, but I loved it so much I bought the Kindle version so that I could bookmark and share my highlights.<br /><br />Highly recommended. It's changed my way of thinking.
B00HJ957BC|4|Very good moive and very intense found myself sitting on the edge of my seat. The wife loved it also
B004X8W4A4|3|Book2 in the Nikki Heat series<br /><br />Without any doubt this charming series is intended for fans of the TV program 'Castle'. Each new addition mimics the warm chemistry created by the show. The plot sends the readers' imagination on a wild ride that has ample cute and amusing twists. This latest is undeniably entertaining, although the writing is run of the mill and predictable; we nevertheless find red herrings, snippets of police work, moments of tensions and romance between the two leads and a snappy dialog.<br /><br />'Naked Heat' centers on the murder of a well-known gossip columnist famous for her revealing articles on people in the public eye. It is rumoured that she is about to release a career making tell-all, one that will blow the minds of all concerned. We follow Nikki Heat and her partner hotshot reporter/writer Jameson Rook and her team of detectives on the trail of the murderer of this high profile columnist. The clues some good some misleading takes us through a maze of information, a world of secrets, cover-ups and scandals as they trade barbs and innuendos all the while taking heat from the press and their superiors.<br /><br />This fun and fast read will appeal to both regulars of the TV show and enthusiasts of simple, exciting mystery novels.
B006MW3UZW|5|I can not stop watching this wonderful series. I will watch forever. Thanks for having a series on TV that is worth watching.. I will watch anything made by these producers and writers. Thanks Amazon....*****<br />Judy White
B00AREIAI8|5|Love the game! Finally something somewhat close to reality!
B00DYCBH4O|4|Fun book. Much easier to listen to it than read it. It was an enjoyable story.  It's a definite must at least once in your life.
B0033H7VI6|5|Big. Beefy. Sharp. Solid.<br /><br />That's really all you need. Holds its edge well and has a great rubber grip on it. Super thick (that's what she said) and awesome. I keep it in my BOB. Love it!
B0054JZC6E|5|This game is really fun. The thing that makes it so awesome is that there are so many games in one app, and it is, like, the only app you need cause there is such a variety if games. I love this app!
0307946711|5|I loved this book! Funny, sad, intelligent.... and then they made it into an awful film.<br /><br />Read the book, avoid the film.
B00TEAVEY8|5|I really enjoy mystery games of all kinds not knowing what fits where and what you need to find, collect, and use in the right place is thrilling the graphics in this game are very good as well, you have no trouble identifying the objects you are looking for
B000UR9TQO|5|I received my set today from Amazon.  I've read all the reviews here and just wanted to add a few details.<br /><br />01. The T-shirt is not bad at all. I buy all my rock shirts extra large and this fits me perfectly, even has the Swan Song logo on the back.  If you have purchased the new Double CD soundtrack which in enclosed in a paper case that is wider than a regular plastic one (Very Well Done) once you remove the shirt it fits perfectly in the box and keeps the other items from shaking around. Coincidence?<br /><br />02.  If you want to send for the free BIG poster that is offered with this set (27x40)the UPC code you must mail in with your order is on the printed paper sheet on the outside of the back of the box so you don't have to cut it off of the box itself leaving a hole.<br /><br />03.  The cards and pictures are very nice to browse through and the case that holds them is also very cool.<br /><br />04.  I'll let others review at length the DVD content, but for me it was all great, the sound was excellent.  When I put the first DVD in after listening to a Guns N Roses DVD the sound was Much Louder and I had to turn the receiver down.<br /><br />05.  All and all a great deal very cheap - Thanks Dudes for making my Holiday Season this year Alot Brighter ! ! !
B0084BMUFA|5|Who doesn't love this story?  It's always fun to read the real story to get the most from the TV productions.
B00M8U883Q|5|Gary is the real deal!
B003YL4LYI|5|Before I read this book I read some harsh criticisms from fellow Ice and Fire fans.  I am glad  to say that I whole heartily disagree.  All of Martin's books have been thrilling an  hold a special place in my heart. He may not have kept telling the story from the beloved characters of the first three books but all chapters, regardless of whose vantage  point they were from, held meaning and  contributed to the overall telling of this fantastic story.
B000002JOF|3|This is a nice enough sounding record, but it's terminally blighted. Rea is a tasty, if unoriginal guitar player: when he isn't aping Telegraph Road-era Knopfler he's ripping off mid seventies Gilmour, complete with wheezy slide. Enough plank-spanking talk, however. The guitar playing is one of the more pleasant aspects of the experience. The songs, and especially the title track are also agreeably melodious and solidly written.<br />But, somehow, it's all just a bit duff.<br />The lyrics don't help; they're fifth form, back-of-exercise-book in spirit and execution, and the rosy-red tinge to them don't really wash when written and delivered by a sportscar-driving portly rock star from High Barnet. More grating, though, is the instrumentation. The title track builds up moodily for a couple of minutes: you know, riders-on-the-storm-esque rain, some wish-you-were-here-esque ambient radio, some purring synth pads, trinkling piano (which I'm pretty sure has been nicked off a Chopin Prelude) and a crisply recorded gravelly voice intoning menacingly and then, from nowhere, SPLISH! WHACK-A-THUMP-A-WHACK-A-THUMP-A, as some clot hits &quot;play&quot; on a Boss Dr. Rhythm drum machine, converting said brooding atmospheric masterpiece into I've Got A Lovely Bunch of Coconuts as played on a Casiotone.<br />WHAT WAS HE THINKING? Clearly someone has invested a lot of studio time and session fees in this project - would it have been that hard to employ a real drummer? Unhappily there's rather a lot of this blight thoughout the record.<br />The Road to Hell isn't bad music, but it's ambient - if you focus on it to the exclusion of all else, pretty soon you'll start wincing and wishing they'd spent another couple of grand on the session band and not relied on machines. But I suppose it was eighties, and it seemed like the right thing to do back then. But then again, so did moon-walking.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Great game only thing that I dislike is the energy thing that limits your experience playing the game
B00008IAMD|2|The music on this CD is outstanding but I was very unhappy to find flaws and skips in the CD.  The CD is cheap enough to replace if the flaws become too irritating and it's not worth the time or effort to return, but I definitely didn't expect flaws in a brand new CD.
B00006G8K0|5|Forget Bela, Christopher Lee is Dracula.<BR>This is the best Hammer film ever. <BR>Unlike modern horror movies, the acting is superb. Lee and Cushing both produce the performances of their careers. <BR>Ever wondered why they were in so many movies????<BR>Well this is the picture is the reason. <BR>A timeless classic.
B00BSBT8M6|5|I this movie.  That is all I have to say.  A very good movie. Six more words, and I am done.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Best game ever just like flappy bird but better it is  like I am actually in the game!!! I love it

B00D7Z4GQY|4|A book club choice made by another member. This book made me realize how fragile life is and how it can change in a moment. One choice can alter the course of not only your own life but have unforeseen consequences in the lives of others.<br />I would recommend this book. It was a quick read and one you look forward to returning to at the end of the day. I especially like that the author provided an epilogue and shared a glimpse into the characters' futures.
B000002JNN|5|I just recently got into AC/DC and I have already purchased 6 of their CDs.  The Razor's Edge is a must for anyone's collection.  Thunderstruck and Money Talks are great songs as is most of their songs.  Be sure to add  this one to your colelction if you haven't already.
B005ZMUQCK|5|Purchased this movie and downloaded it to my Kindle Fire with ease.  My grandson loves to watch this movie.  Great entertainment!  Thank you!
B0041VV03A|2|Good concept, but terrible delivery.    The sex scenes are incredibly awkward, and the latter scenes are borderline bestiality.    I recommend you watch this alone because it WILL get awkward if you watch it with your friends or your SO.
B004MC8CA2|5|I love this app. I use it when I go to church or at home when I am reading my daily word.
B002UWH8P6|5|Awesome
B00GDL5HNA|4|They are great singers and their songs are well written and felt. Their musical craftsmanship is excellent. As close to perfect musically as you can get.
B00DR0PDNE|5|This replaced my media computer for netflix.  Much better to use an interactive touchscreen as a netflix remote.  This WILL be the future.  Mark my words.  Soon it will just be built right into TV's.
B00102F5WK|5|This truly was a great movie showing what is wrong with torture and the current U.S. policy of illegal torture and rendition. If you want to know what is really going on in the world, then this is a movie for you. Torturing someone who is innocent will, in turn, get false confessions. This movie shows you how an innocent man tortured enough will confess to anything in order to make the torture stop. We have a lot of problems in the world and kidnapping people and shipping them off to be tortured in other countries is very despicable. If someone is really guilty then they should be tried and convicted; instead, we torture them in an unknown location and we get many false confessions. This truly was a powerful movie. I highly recommend this to anyone. The people who control our government are out of control and extremely criminal. They do not care about the truth or justice. As a side note: most of the major terrorist attacks, if you study them, have been carried out by quite a few of the various countries themselves. Research false-flag terror and you will get an idea for what i am saying.
B0083B16AG|5|Exactly what was promised.
0307237699|5|Great read.  Barack Obama really knows how to express big ideas in an entertaining fashion.  This guy has terrific writing skills.  As a Republican who was interested in his positions, this was the perfect book to read.
B0066WJLU6|5|Really Bright!!!
0857522329|2|Same story could be better told without the extremely bad language.
B005CRQ4GU|5|The third wheel was a good book<br />I loved it and I love your books they are really really funny
B008469DGY|4|Good game not like real golf but fun to play. Good time killer and calms you down. It is also at time hard.
B00H7Z7XA6|5|I got this AMD a10-7700k as part of a cheap entry level gaming build. After doing my research, looking at reviews and overviews, watching the keynote from amd at CES I was sold on this processor. I'm very excited to see what the HSA (Heterogeneous System Architecture) has in store in terms of performance and efficiency gains along with their Mantle software. It took me a while to set up the dual graphics mode on my gigabyte ga-f2a88xm-d3h motherboard with my gigabyte r7 250 OC 1gb gddr5 128bit graphics card and 8gb of silicon power 2133 ram. I haven't been able to do a thorough test yet, but assassins creed 1 is able to play at almost max settings at 1680x1050 resolutions at 60fps without the dual graphics mode. The processor itself over clocks well with the stock cooler at a max of 4.1ghz. Overall I'm very satisfied with what I got and how it performs. I will update upon Mantle release.
B000002UA0|3|This is a great album, don't get me wrong. But Syd Barret was so off his rocker, that it could kind of get to you a little. For the Floydians who like to grasp some type of a concept from a Pink Floyd album, this is not a  good record to get hooked on. These are simply fun songs, and have good  rythyms to them. &quot;Bike&quot; is fun to sing along to..and any Floydian  fan that has had an infatuation with a girl before can relate to it.
B00005N6KG|5|These headphones are great for listening to your music, it is so clear..they fit very well to, and stay were you put them. You can hear the music very well, and quick shipment..
B00A8ECU24|1|This thing does not work at all on the kindle fire.<br /><br />What a disappointment, but then I heard it has a downright disgusting cash shop so I'm glad we didn't get it
B000I0QK74|5|This is one of the best Christmas CDs released in a long while.  Every song touches you in some way.   The best!!!!!     A must have in anyone's collection.
B000R4SMCW|5|This was the best movie ever! I never watch a movie more than once yet I am dieing for it to come out on DVD so I can watch it again.     Anthony Hopkins is excellent with his creepy hannibal lecter-like performance.     Ryan Gosling is so sexy with superb acting skills.    Together Ryan and Anthony are brilliant. Each scene with the two of them is so intense it makes you wanna scream.     INTENSE is the perfect word for this movie. IT WAS SO INTENSE! Definately a must see film.
161655164X|5|Its amazing
B00DJZR46G|4|The ensuing is my own track-by-track take on Elton's new album followed by an overall summary of it as a whole. It's a long read, but hopefully you'll still be awake by the end of it. Enjoy!<br /><br />Classic ★★★★★<br />Excellent ★★★★<br />Good ★★★<br />Mediocre ★★<br />Poor ★<br /><br />1. Oceans Away<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Weight of the World\\".<br />\\"Eight Hundred Dollar Shoes\\".<br />\\"I Need You to Turn To\\" or \\"First Episode at Hienton\\" in the piano playing style of the second verse.<br />· A sparse, beautiful homage to WWII vets and the elderly that sets the tone for the rest of The Diving Board: This is Elton's show, and no one else's. His singing here is emotive, intimate at points and sounds quite sincere. It's a much more inspired opener, in my opinion, than \\"Weight of the World\\" on Peachtree Road; maybe not as good as \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" on Songs from the West Coast, but certainly on a par with \\"Postcards from Richard Nixon\\" on The Captain & the Kid.<br /><br />2. Oscar Wilde Gets Out<br />Rating: ★★★★1/2<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Come Down in Time\\".<br />\\"Where to Now, St. Peter?\\".<br />\\"The Trail We Blaze\\".<br />\\"Hell\\" (Made in England outtake).<br />Something from Fleetwood Mac or Billy Joel.<br />· One of my faves on this disc. A bit wordy, but I love the dark lyric, haunting piano lick and angry vibe in this one... it feels engulfed in a sense of sadness. The absolute best part is the staccato-pumped bridge where Elton and the 2CELLOS go all-out in intensity.<br /><br />3. A Town Called Jubilee<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Ballad of a Well-Known Gun\\".<br />\\"Rotten Peaches\\".<br />· This is one of those that's had to grow on me with repeated listens. Great, rousing chorus with a slight sense of urgency and some vibrant imagery throughout the rest of the song. I especially like the airy verses, immensely clever piano playing underpinning the chorus and his equally fancy piano playing in the instrumental.<br /><br />4. The Ballad of Blind Tom<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Not a Tea Dance\\" from the Billy Elliot demos.<br />· An aggressive, punchy and dramatic piece backed by a driving rhythm. The cinematic lines are some of the best on the entire album. There's sneaky backing vocals going on over in the left channel of the chorus here if you haven't noticed. The melody, and rather the chorus, does bear an initial and slight resemblance to \\"Not a Tea Dance\\" - but once you get over that then it really doesn't matter because \\"Blind Tom\\" itself is just so alluring. I think what really would have made this one for the ages is Elton just going completely mental with a song-ending piano solo from another planet... oh well!<br /><br />5. Dream #1<br />Rating: ★★★<br />· A piano interlude that ends somewhat abruptly, yet it's decent enough and I tend to look at it as just a nice palette cleanser. Nothing special.<br /><br />6. My Quicksand<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Someone's Final Song\\".<br />\\"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\\".<br />\\"Make Me As You Are\\" from the Lestat demos.<br />\\"Nothing Here\\" from the Lestat demos.<br />· The weakest link at first; not an instant pleaser... but it grows on you with each listen. It's complexity brings to mind Blue Moves' deepest and most serious material: dark, European stuff that's painful (in a good way) and heavy to listen to. And just imagine a younger Elton singing this one; it's so good... his current raspy vibrato can be so distracting at times to the point where it unfortunately doesn't serve this one much justice, depending on a person's tastes of course. But that jazzy instrumental section is 'out of left field' alright on an otherwise classical-leaning track.<br /><br />7. Can't Stay Alone Tonight<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues\\".<br />\\"I Know Why I'm in Love\\".<br />\\"Take Me Back\\".<br />\\"Turn the Lights Out When You Leave\\".<br />· The most accessible song on the CD. It's rock-solid with superb hooks and a breezy, country feel. Bouncy, swaying and instantly catchy with vocals sort of resembling Neil Diamond's in a way (!). The lyric is trite by Bernie's standards, but Elton reaches deep down into his bag of killer chords to make it work somehow. I believe it's the perfect followup single to \\"Home Again\\"; whereas \\"Home Again\\" is slow, serious and somber, CSAT is just the complete opposite: midtempo, loose, casual and a real toe-tapper. An AC radio Top 12 single, at the very least.<br /><br />8. Voyeur<br />Rating: ★★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Rocket Man\\" (live).<br />\\"The Retreat\\" in those last few seconds at the very end.<br />· The centerpiece of the album; it's an enchanting thrill ride that builds to a fever pitch before finishing off with a similar, if not identical piano lick from the `80s B-side \\"The Retreat\\". Deceptively colorful bass playing here and a booming bass drum in that echoing coda. Bernie's most intriguing lyric and perhaps Elton's most ambitious vocal in the entire set, but too sophisticated to be a single... it needs an actual chorus in order to achieve any measure of success on the radio. Despite that, it's the one song on TDB that I'll consider to be a truly classic album cut.<br /><br />9. Home Again<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"The Bridge\\".<br />\\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\".<br />\\"The One\\".<br />\\"Gone to Shiloh\\".<br />\\"Tonight\\" in those last climbing piano notes at the very end.<br />· Well-crafted with a feeling of longing; it's soaring chorus sticks in your head as it grows on you with repeated listens. It's a really nice reminder of or tip-of-the-hat to other lead singles from the past such as \\"The One\\" and \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\", and his pianosolo in this one is probably the most attention-grabbing on the entire LP.<br /><br />10. Take This Dirty Water<br />Rating: ★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"If There's a God in Heaven (What's He Waiting For?)\\".<br />\\"Boogie Pilgrim\\".<br />· Suffice to say, it hasn't grown on me. The lone misfire here and a near dud in my book; its strength comes from being a `mood' piece rather than as a nuanced standout with satisfying twists & turns like the others. Lightweight, with a repetitious and almost monotonous melody. Solid performances all around though, and I know there are some people out there who think it should be a single, but it's not adventurous at all and a bit of a throwaway... sorry.<br /><br />11. Dream #2<br />Rating: ★★★<br />· Another pretty, short piano interlude that basically serves as another palette cleanser, but just a little more developed this time around.<br /><br />12. The New Fever Waltz<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Belfast\\".<br />\\"Seasons\\".<br />\\"Carla/Etude\\".<br />· In terms of painting a vivid picture, it captures some of that old Elton magic from his early years. Charismatic and enticing, and the arrangement on it is captivating without being overwhelming. Lovely.<br /><br />13. Mexican Vacation (Kids in the Candlelight)<br />Rating: ★★★1/2<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"The Wasteland\\".<br />\\"They Call Her the Cat\\".<br />\\"Just Like Noah's Ark\\".<br />· Another lightweight tune, yet it's miles more interesting both lyrically and melodically than \\"Take This Dirty Water\\". An obviously decent amount of energy in a blues jam that just lacks pizzazz; there is a groove here which sounds way too familiar, so that there may lay the problem. Surprisingly enough, it's still undeniably one of the more commercial-sounding tracks on an otherwise uncommercial album.<br /><br />14. Dream #3<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Madman Across the Water\\".<br />\\"Sixty Years On\\".<br />· The third and final piano interlude, and the most innovative one at that. Tension-filled and stark, and the most developed of the three... it's the definition of musical excellence and the gold standard of which we've all come to expect from Elton as far his skills on the keyboards go.<br /><br />15. The Diving Board<br />Rating: ★★★★1/2<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Blue Eyes\\".<br />\\"Idol\\".<br />· \\"Blue Eyes\\" reincarnated. His vocal phrasing here is sassy and full of swag, and the song just glides, dips and darts its way into your breaking heart with this one burning question: 'Fame and fortune may be awaiting you, but are you ready for fame and fortune?' One of his most mature recordings to date.<br /><br />Bonus tracks:<br />1. 5th Avenue: ★★★★1/2<br />· Ambient, classy and regretful. Definitely worthy of inclusion on the LP as a replacement for \\"Take This Dirty Water\\".<br /><br />2. Gauguin Goes Hollywood: ★★★1/2<br />· Sweeping and romanticized, with some cool horns and strings peppered in. Slightly more engaging than \\"Candlelit Bedroom\\".<br /><br />3. Candlelit Bedroom: ★★★<br />· A tad pedestrian but still pleasant nonetheless; a poor man's \\"I Want Love\\".<br /><br />Album rating: ★★★★ (4.25 rounded down to 4.0)<br />· By a slim margin, The Diving Board is Elton's best studio album since at least 2001's Songs from the West Coast. It is an effort that is way more impressive artistically and greater as a textured whole rather than the sum of its parts. If anything, this album deserves praise for having the balls to defy most casual fans' ideals and expectations of what a typical latter day Elton John record should be, which is instantly likeable pop music that is ultimately underappreciated and decisively forgettable in the long run. TDB \\"feels\\" poignant and isn't aimed at a lowbrow audience, and it begs to be memorable and much longer-lasting in people's consciousness with repeated listens. Itevokes fond flashbacks to both Elton's '70s and early '00s output, particularly albums such as Elton John (1970), Tumbleweed Connection (1971), Madman Across the Water (1971), Blue Moves (1976) and the aforementioned SFTWC - yet it ultimately establishes a distinct identity of its own as a confident, 2013 version of Elton looking to think a bit outside the box and create a set focused more on substance rather than commerce or pleasing the masses.<br /><br />With that said, if this album lacks anything - it's missing the presence of that classic EJ sound, namely his touring band's backing vocals and Paul Buckmaster's string arrangements; and let's be honest: quite a few of the melodies here do ring like slight variations of songs he's done before. However, T-Bone Burnett does triumphantly fulfill his vision of a crisp, simple and warm production, and the reliably polished storytelling by the legendary John/Taupin songwriting team is immensely entertaining here.<br /><br />TDB is not anywhere close to being a masterpiece, however I do believe it's destined to be an enduring album that will be much more appreciated as time passes by those people who've already dismissed it for its supposed shortcomings.<br /><br />Next single: \\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight\\" (Radio Edit) 3:46<br />Song to remove: \\"Take This Dirty Water\\" out with \\"5th Avenue\\" in instead, and then \\"Home Again\\" switching places with \\"Voyeur\\" in the tracklisting:<br /><br />01. Oceans Away<br />02. Oscar Wilde Gets Out<br />03. A Town Called Jubilee<br />04. 5th Avenue<br />05. The Ballad of Blind Tom<br />06. Dream #1<br />07. My Quicksand<br />08. Can't Stay Alone Tonight<br />09. Home Again<br />10. Voyeur<br />11. Dream #2<br />12. The New Fever Waltz<br />13. Mexican Vacation (Kids in the Candlelight)<br />14. Dream #3<br />15. The Diving Board.<br /><br />What's next: Elton's done his stripped-down, piano based album... so now what? I think his next step should be an attempt at a more pop/rock oriented sound, and an album along the lines of a Honky Château or SFTWC; perhaps also following Paul McCartney's lead on his latest in using multiple producers (T-Bone, Patrick Leonard and someone else?), and having Davey & Nigel play on several tracks with Buckmaster presiding over the string arrangements.
B00KBNRZ9K|1|I'm with the vast majority of fans who refuse to be extorted into buying the expensive vinyl box set when all I really want is the 5.1 surround sound blu-ray. Sure, it may become available in the future, but then again, it may not, so why take the chance? As soon as the 5.1 DVD is back in stock on Floyd's web site, I won't be able to place my order fast enough. Keep in mind what happened to those poor souls who paid through the nose for &#34;The Wall&#34; immersion box set, only to be screwed out of any 5.1 DVD at all! Now they're all hoping and praying for a separate surround sound disk release (be it blu-ray, SACD, DVD-A or whatever). Also, I don't think the band is at fault here, I think the record company whores are trying to gouge us for whatever they think they can possibly get away with. At least the band had the decency to make a 5.1 disk version of The Division Bell available separately (and at a great price, I might add) to those of us who enjoy surround sound and aren't interested in vinyl. If you buy The Division Bell &#34;deluxe&#34; box set just for the blu-ray, then that's on you, and you're basically telling the whores at the record company that you don't mind getting screwed at all. Me, I'll wait till some &#34;vinylphile&#34; who doesn't even own a blu-ray player to sell his disk separately for $20 to $40. I may not have a lot of money (I'm on disability), but I do have an abundance of patience.
B000P0J09M|1|This movie plays like an incredibly well made, overly long, TV re-enactment.  It is based upon the imagination of a moron, filled with exageration, cliche, and caricature.  Why anyone would waste their time with this is beyond me.
B008M721MS|5|Yes to Skype app. It means when you travel you can keep in touch. This is a great little app to add and keep.
B0063GORYU|5|this game is one of my least favorite apps. i absolutely hate it and i wouldnt recommend it to anyone! please for the love of god, DO NOT get this app!
B00UXOKLAM|5|I really like this CD, from the beginning to the end. Yelawolf comes through like he never did before, with a bit of singing, and smoother harmonies.  Who knew he can sing?  These are more mature, melodic, and meaningful songs than he's done in the past, but still has that country boy hip hop swagger.  I think this album will be the one to make him a top artist.
B00687Q0VC|4|Great way to learn about the birth of our nation.  Well done. Have to listen carefully.
B001LF3YQK|5|We use this all the time with wipes for our baby. Beats having to open a case and having them all fall out when trying to clean our baby. Simply slide the red cap back and pull of the wipe and everything else stays in. :)
B005LJK3AC|5|Horrible Bosses is a hilarious comedy.  It is particularly awesome to watch if you too have a horrible boss (there are so many bad ones out there).  Jennifer Aniston delivers a spot on performance.  Her role is hilarious and not what you would typically expect from the &#34;Friends&#34; star.  Jason Bateman is witty and hilarious.  Kevin Spacey is one of the &#34;horrible bosses&#34; and his performance is stellar.  He delivers dry humor and plays the part well.  I could not stop laughing throughout this one.  I definitely recommend the movie.
B004LWZW42|5|this was a christmas gift for my daughter. she loves x men and will watch this numerous times I'm sure.
0345525558|5|I planned to read one paragraph and ended up reading the whole book in 1 day i was so drawn in. Great story and real life situations that could happen to any of us. The characters were wonderful and the history on the flower dictionary is wonderful, now I'm afraid to cook with basil, so i don't spread hate
B000067CPX|5|i must admit when i first heard this cd i had to say, where did the chilipeppers go? there was no hard funk anywhere on this cd like everyone is used to. well i listened to it a few times and after a while some of the songs really started to jump out at me. then i realized that this cd was going in a whole different direction than any other previous cds. i have to hand it to rhcp, they made a cd for themselves and not for thier fans. you can tell they worked long and hard to make each song sound like nothing you've never heard before. some people will be able to follow them there, but most people won't. if you like the older stuff like mother's milk or blood sugar sex and magic you won't like this cd.
B0094BB4TW|5|Every time I ordered i was pleased.
B002T9H2LA|5|I've seen this movie twice and just ordered the DVD, so obviously I enjoyed it.  It is a very entertaining film and Tarantino fans should be quite pleased.  It was, however, not quite up to Kill Bill standards in my book.  I've tried to put my finger on why and haven't yet been able to figure it out.  They both had great actors, great dialogue, great cinematography and they were even both revenge flicks, but Basterds just misses the mark slightly for some reason. If Amazon allowed it, I would have given it 4 1/2 stars because of that vague feeling of something not being quite right.  But heck, how many movies these days are even 4 1/2 stars?  See it; it's definitely worth the time.
B00O0MBJPO|4|After such a long absence, Garth is as great as he ever was with his strong, identifiable voice.  My disappointments with the CD  are with the tone of the music and his enunciation.  The majority of these new songs seem to be about messages and are mostly tear-jerkers.  I was very much looking forward to some fun & songs to dance to in this long-awaited CD!!  Also, and more importantly, many of the lyrics were difficult to hear and much less understand with poor enunciation, and at the end of some tracks, he allowed his voice to trail off leaving us to wonder what he had just sung!!!  Just hope his next CD will be worthy of a 5-star rating.
B00A6CCF0K|1|This is the only Steven Kind book that I had to just close and stop reading. For me it was awful, formulaic and really lacking<br />the brilliant imagination and pure genius of previous King books. I wondered more than once if King, under pressure from his managers (he is<br />a billion dollar business empire) allowed others to hobble together most of this. But I do believe the bits about drugs and drug details he certainly wrote himself. His writing changed after his accident, more drug stuff and also a lot more of just disgusting and low vibe environments, not scary just well tired and gross and going on and on as well as with the tired sex situations and allegory.<br />Well I've yammered on long enough. Sorry Steve but you've still got zillions more likers than 'didn't like hers. You're still a genius but maybe going vegetarian would help. I don't know. Happy New Year.
B00LSOKV3S|5|Excellent!
B009X01FJS|4|I was really happy to find this cover does work as described. You can stand it up or sideways and it's very solid. The plastic bottom fits very snug, so it took a little maneuvering to get it fixed right. The case probably doubles the weight of the Kindle, but it really protects it well.
B004SIP6QI|5|love it just wish it had had a better ending but all aside I give it a 10
B001QVFDA4|5|Gerard Butler and Tom Hardy make the movie! I have already watched it several times, def a must see movie!
B0054JZC6E|5|I can't live without this game. I'm looking for every free minute at work to spend with 101-in-1 games. Some mini games are really hard.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|The game is really great. Although I wish the bird wasn't so heavy because when you tap the bird, the motion sensor just seems a bit heavy. But it's a great game don't get me wrong. I would really like if Flappy Bird was brought back and put onto the Amazon app store. This game is almost similar to Flappy Birds. It's not too bad of a game. If you ask for my advice, I would say just get this app and try it. You may like it or not but give this game a try out. It's a good game actually.
B004SUWR2C|5|Excellent game don't like the 7 0 rule but the<br />Game is great fun game play the game<br />tournament it's fin
B0006N2EZ0|4|I liked this movie a lot the music was off the hook. Witney's performance was a very good loved her in this.
B000085RPU|1|This movie would not play in any of our DVD players, old or new, I feel it was some boot leg and I got ripped off
B0063M22QO|5|Very smooth game that is easy to see. This is my favorite Mahjong yet out of several I have downloaded.
B00FLDG42Y|5|Hi if you cant get to see them live then this is the CD for you. Rush has captured the live sounds here that are crisp and clear just like being at the concert. This CD is a great buy from Amazon you will never get at your local music store. Thank you and CHEERS D
B00L9B7IKE|5|I really enjoyed this book.
B0026P3G12|5|Wow! All I can say is WOW!  I had no intentions of buying this CD until I heard Susan on The Today Show.  I then listened to all the tracks on the Amazon site.  I bought the CD and LOVE it!
B00DHKKN6Q|2|Not challenging
B00CKOQC9C|5|Bradberry has written one of the best science fiction novels I have ever read. His vignettes of the lives and experiences of humans and Martians are brought to life through a gripping and poetic story telling ability. His writing craft, use of diction and allegorical devices and similes allows you to deeply feel his character's joys, sorrows, loneliness, anger, hopes, and aspirations. Many science fiction stories rely on an author's imaginative story to entice the audience. Recently it seems that more and more TV shows and books rely on shock effect, plot twists, and emotional wrenching to drive a story. Although The Martian Chronicles does present a compelling plot, its true power is found in the author's writing craft. This book represents everything that we can hope for from the science fiction genre: intriguing plot, masterful storytelling, and insightful commentary on some of the most pressing issues facing humanity and our future. I highly recommend this book to anyone and especially to those seeking to understand excellent writing.
B008AT9XOC|4|When Ellen Green knocks out Suddenly Semour, it's one of the great scenes of all times.  Steve Martin is a hoot.
B0050PYNO4|1|The movie is funny.  I give 1 star because if you're watching the BD on an internet-enabled player, the software on the disk will download and show you ads while you are in the various menus.
B00CDT41RY|5|great movie
B002ZTQVGQ|5|My family love this series. Animation is great. A sweet storyline filled with lots of fun, adventure and friendship. Highly recommended for the entire family.
B005OHSD3A|5|good recipes & tips
B0054JZC6E|4|Lots of levels and different types of games. skill level seems to be fifteenth for each which keeps it fun! It keeps me entertained which is all I ask for!!
B00024I2Z4|4|I LOVE that this portrays a strong female character and also another belief system (as did Pocahontas), but do not like the dressing up and behaving a certain way to  \\"be marriageable.\\" The only saving grace for that aspect is that the great warrior seeks Mulan out (as marriageable), knowing she is nothing like those \\"traditional\\" women the match-maker is readying for marriage. I also think the character of the little dragon who earns his way back into an honored place amongst the honored ancestors is a great character and a good lesson about quick thinking, perseverance, and determination. I like this movie and I'm glad my 4 year old granddaughter loves it, even if she's moved on to Peter Pan after watching this one more times than I can count. There are not enough videos for children with strong female characters.
B00KW1TGDE|5|They work, they are bright, they are cool. I can sit under them without turning my air conditioner down. Nice!
B001IAOEXU|5|Definitivamente, valio la pena la compra de este par de piezas clave para un mejor uso del control del PS3 cuando no lo tienes pues como que notas que algo le falta a los triggers y ahi la vas librando pero cuando los compras y los utilizas, te das cuenta de que es un valor agregado para tu control, sobre todo en first person shooters como Call of Duty o en juegos de carreras tipo Need For Speed o de batallas cuerpo a cuerpo como Dragon Ball Burst Limit. El soporte que ofrecen permite una mejoria al momento de \\"disparar\\" y son muy comodos, ni siquiera notas que hay algo extra en el control, son livianos de un color casi igual pues estan hechos con un material similar en un 90-95 % de manera que jamas te haran estorbo. Deben tener cuidado de no botar el control pues si este cae del lado de los trigger, generalmente asi cae, se pueden quebrar los sooprtes pues son sensibles, y por ser plastico es facil de que se rompa, pero solo si es una caida fuerte, cuando a mi me paso 1 vez, salieron volando... ES UNA EXCELENTE COMPRA, VALE LA PENA!    This purchase definitively worth it! when you don't have this things well it seems that something is missing from the controll but it's ok... but when you buy this littles things ant try it! you can realize that add an extra value to the controll. this things are perfect in FPS games like Call of Duty and in Race Games like Need for Speed or the fight ones like Dragon Ball Burst Limit ! i recommend widely are so comfortable, light and are made of almost the same material that the original triggers maybe a 90-95% of similarity.  You should be careful to not let the controll falls because this things can be broke because are made of plastic and are kinda sensible, first times maybe will fly by the air!   IT IS AN EXCELENT PURCHASE i recommend!
B00A83075M|5|Excellent movie, very funny, good for all ages. A bit scary for younger kids (3 & under) Otherwise a new family favorite.
B00XOX9QCS|5|Finally, after a string of sequels that I had high hopes for, eagerly anticipated, and was dissapointed by (Tron 2, Prometheus, Star Wars 1-3) a movie that lives up to its promise!
0811870987|4|Hundreds of pages of beautiful \\"photos\\" of birds on white backgrounds. From the other comments I was expecting photographs with incredible detail. Instead they look like photos that were edited in Photoshop with the watercolor and pencil effects. As photographs they are somewhat flat, 2D, and suffer from artifice. However, if you like the drawings in the birding books you'll love Bird, because that's exactly what you get. You can see what the images look like on the Amazon page for the book, in the section labeled \\"Take a Closer Look: Selected Photographs from Bird.\\" They are beautiful, they just aren't photographic in appearance.
B000QCS8TW|5|if you have seen the series you got to read this book. I think you will love the author and some of the characters.
B0085A9HXS|5|Not much you can say about this movie except, if you love action, this is for you! I also appreciate the fact that the DVD is dubbed into English. I don't ,mind reading a drama, but in an action movie, I want to be paying attention to the action!
B003LQ3YXU|5|Super geeky and live that it plays homage to the old story lines too.
1484707230|5|I got completely addicted to these books.  I was introduced to them by my much younger siblings.  If you're looking for a great gift for an avid reader, this set will work for any age.
B00IJJUIMY|1|The worst book he has ever written!!
B0074D3CAQ|5|Was sad when the book was done.  I wanted it to go on and on.
B002Q4TKAY|5|What can I say?  If you are a Killers fan, you will love the DVD and CD -- if you're not a Killers fan, you probably will be after listening!!  This is an amazing set, the Killers are such great performers that watching the DVD is second only to being there!  I was also very pleased with the selection of music, which covers ALL of their albums!  The Killers REALLY rock live.  :)
B003MC5N28|5|Great
0061703257|4|Great book.  Written very well and a true page turner.  Better than the movie but the movie was good too.  It'll keep you up reading for sure...

B00594XOZU|5|I swear this is one of the best apps I have bought. Its most definitely affordable :P. and its awesome because I dont have a phone yet so I can just use this in stead of texting anyway if your reading this thank you for taking the time to read it :)
B001HTLKCU|5|This is a truly wondefull experience, the time taken to perfect an amazing concert experience was well worth while it is probably better than being there. congratulations boys. 10 out of 10.
B009YQJ322|5|Loved everything about this movie. Solid lead actors. Great action. Nice effects.<br /><br />Probably closer to our true future than we'd care to realize.<br /><br />Nuff said.
0345448898|5|After finishing the 4th Harry Potter book I moped around for a few days lamenting the fact that the next installment isn't due for publication for quite some time. Luckily, a friend of mine suggested the Dark Materials series by Phillip Pullman. Five pages in to The Golden Compass I was hooked. With a &quot;Potter like&quot; fervor I ripped through the first book in two very long nights. After which I was useless at work, but just as satisfied as when I first discovered the work of J.K. Rowlings. A great read!<br />A note to parents: The world that Pullman conjurs is a bit darker than Harry Potter's. There is more violence and some very frightening situations. I'd say 11 and up would be a good age for these books.
B000BMYWYC|5|This is the glue to use on any plastic model.  The jar is equipped with a fine applicator which reduces the chance to get glue where you don't want it and makes it better to paint a clean plastic surface without glue.  This is another example of Tamiya's effort to provide the necessary tools to build their models with a degree of ease.
B00NCGXYJS|5|Whether you're a fan of Bette or of the 60's &#34;girl groups,&#34; this is a collection of covers that will have you &#34;grooving&#34; to some new takes on old standards.  A wonderfully orchestrated effort. You can even catch some videos of a preview show she did using some of the featured songs on U Tube.
B00688628M|5|Just gets better with time
020530902X|5|ok
B001PA0FFO|5|In various 'professional' reviews of John Patrick Shanley's adaptation of his own hit play, I've read things like \\"Philip Seymour Hoffman goes toe to toe with Meryl Streep\\"..and \\"Amy Adams holds her own against Meryl Streep\\"..and \\"despite only being on the screen for 12 minutes, Viola Davis hangs with Meryl Streep.\\"  Hmmmm [scratches chin]...what do these reactions all have in common?  Only that Meryl Streep is the measuring stick against whom all others are to be judged.  I guess it's passe to say directly that Meryl Streep is extraordinary.  Instead, everyone now puts her co-stars on some type of Streep-o-meter.  Needless to say, the best performance in a Meryl Streep movie is...Meryl Streep.  That's taken for granted some times.<br /><br />The movie itself is pure dynamite.  As someone who was raised as a Catholic in the 60s and attended a Catholic high school in the 70s, this movie resonated deeply with me.  One scene that stuck out: Shanley's juxtaposition of the prim, cloistered convent with its almost mute nuns, followed immediately by nothing less than the raucous cacophony of the rectory with its hard-drinking, garrulous priests.  This scene was pure genius and no doubt left many of my fellow Catholics of a certain age thrilled with such a realistic portrayal.  I raved to my wife after the film about absolute truth of that passage.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman nails his role here.  His character is believable as a mentor to the boys - the scene where he helps them shoot foul shots and answers some of their questions shows that mentoring side.  But Shanley's script is subtle and telling here, too, because we also get some of the character's quirkiness.  Hoffman shows the boys his clean nails and says \\"I like to keep them a little long.\\"  Just enough to make you start thinking...
B00QW8TYWO|5|When I played this game I knew that it was so good it shouldn't have been 99¢ so I just hope that all of you guys like it as much as I do I'm just 10 years old so you don't have to listen to me but I hope you do =)
B00FHG19T8|5|Good
B00CF34B2I|3|it seems like a good app, except wont load. Ive tried everything. Nothing works. It may be my old kindle, but I think it would still work. All I'm going to say.
B000NQPZCO|5|Love this movie and even better in Blu-Ray!
B004JN1CW4|1|I really liked the maze runner and the scorch trials but this book really didn't do it for me. I will avoid spoilers and say that the story really didn't wrap up very well and leaves much to be desired for any type of resolution. The characters, especially the main character Thomas, did not stay true to the personality that was built in the first two books. I mean no offense to the author at all but it seems this one was rushed or that he almost lost interest or sight of the story by the end.
B0083GQVXI|5|A great movie about psychological problems, are humans born monsters or are they created?
B0059XTUVI|3|I keep thinking there's something wrong with me and my all-too-American tastes, because the genteel, veddy-veddy-British sensibilities of well-reviewed films like \\"Howard's End\\" and \\"Remains of the Day\\" and even \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" barely hold my interest. Sadly, \\"The Iron Lady\\" almost falls into the same category. Yes, Meryl Streep's performance is worthy of her Best Actress Oscar, but the writing and directing lack punch and focus. Without the gimmick of Thatcher's dead husband continually surfacing as an hallucination, the film would have little going for it beyond Streep's remarkable acting. Not to quibble (who am I kidding, it is a quibble), Streep's accent occasionally sounds like her Julia Childs impersonation. This is a film worth watching once, but perhaps not a keeper for your collection. And I KNOW the British can make dynamic, compelling, watchable films. See \\"Love, Actually,\\" any in the Harry Potter series, \\"The King's Speech\\" and \\"Shakespeare in Love.\\"
B005CRQ4GU|5|I love the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. I started reading them ever since 4th grade. I wanna read the rest so much! BUY THIS BOOK, PEOPLE

B00APKIN1I|5|Recorded the old fashioned way on analog recording tape (ATR Magnetics USA) with the musicians all present and working together makes this album a Blast from the Past. Even the jacket replicating a 1&#34; reel of master tape is awsome!<br />Thanks to Grohl the custom &#34;Neve&#34; mixer lives on. Lets be honest, our world is analog and we hear analog not digital. Anyone can compose music on a computer with little or no talent but true musicians get together in a studio and jam!<br />Sound City, Thats It Man!

B0006GAI6O|4|Im not a richard gere or a jennifer lopez fan but my fiance dragged me into this movie.  I found that I actually enjoyed it.  Richard Gere is a lawyer who seems to me missing something in his life and notices Jennifer lopez in a dance school window.  His curiosity in piqued and he goes in and begins to find that he likes to dance ballroom and other styles and eventually is in a dance contest.  Jennifer lopez is a teacher who lost in a big dance tournament in England and has lost her partner and she is burned out.  Seeing that Gere is really enjoying himself, brings back her flame to dance competetively again. <br /> <br />It is a very nice story, well done in my opinion. The supporting cast is very good.  I really enjoyed Stanley Tucci who is closet latin dancer, Gere discovers this while taking the lessons and there is some funny scenes with Tucci and Gere. <br /> <br />Susan Sarandon is also in this movie as Geres wife who is wondering why her husband is coming home late and her efforts to find out why. <br /> <br />Like I said in the title, I went in relucantly but found that I had a enjoyable time watching this movie
B0089EHWQE|5|Good book...you'll enjoy it!  Nice to order from Amazon with no cost of shipping!  Prime is definitely worth the money!
B00I3WTXCS|1|it could have been a 5 stars game....unfortunately,  it keep getting stack with every touch ...it's so annoying. the graphics are great, and it looks like it has a good potencial to be interesting and challenging, if only it will let me play .....ugh...please fix the problems!
1573226521|5|I might just be too generous giving this 5 stars as when it comes to the genre of tropical beaches i tend to love the book immediatley but this is a well written book and with it been his first has been very well thought. I liked the idea of exploring to find the beach as it's the kind of thing i would do so it made me empathise with the characters (especially Richard), the book is alot better than the film the film does'nt really do the book justice and the book is very lucid and well conducted throughout, the beach is a great modern adveture story and when you read the book is easy to see why you could be inspired enough to make a film of it, it's a hooking, captivating book thats hard to put down with no reall errors in it so if your looking for a good adventure book then this is probably the one, it's also got a good refrance to modern life like street fighter 2 on the gameboy etc..
B007J4T2G8|1|Bad book!  Read meymoon's review,\\" was this written by a teenager?\\".  She was spot on. Don't bother with it. Waste of money. I should have known better.

B00HERGNR6|5|Thor: The Dark World picks up where the first movie Thor left off.  Thor will also continue to be part of the Avengers.  Its a good movie
B00004Y6NW|4|Released in the late 70's in America, this Mark Knopfler-led quarter garnered a sold-out tour, a multi-platinum album and a #1 single in the massively popular &quot;Sultans of Swing.&quot; Knopfler's Dylanesque vocal stylings and virtuoso Stratocaster lead guitar playing were the perfect breath of fresh air to American radio audiences tired of the power chording incompetence of Oingo Boingo, The Buzzcocks, The Waitresses, and the rest of the post-disco New Wave ilk. Indeed, Dire Straits sound so impressed rock writers of the day, they practically represented New Wave's platform of individuality and originality of expression. Unlike most of that movement's tenants, however, Dire Straits proved they were here for the duration, amassing another masterpiece with 1983's &quot;Making Movies&quot; and a multi-platinum seller with 1987's &quot;Brothers In Arms.&quot; Knopfler's ingenious use of echo is tastefully woven between dobro and hard-rocking guitar (&quot;Down to The Waterline,&quot; &quot;Water Of Love&quot;) and the lyrics back up the tough, if sparse, instrumental arrangements. The group's sound would change with the departure of rhythm guitarist David Knopfler and drummer Pique Withers, but this late-70's statement remains the genesis of a genuinely fresh and talented rock group whose frontman's (Mark Knopfler) compositions continue to change popular music today.
B0054JZC6E|5|this app is one of my favorite app in the entire world! I hope you love this app a lot.
B000BNTM96|4|This DVD is a must for any level of fan.  The fact that you get both a DVD and a CD of live material is worth the price of admission.  Good song selection on both discs with sound and video that's pretty decent as well.  My favorite is the bonus part of the DVD as you get to see other incarnations of the band at various times in the ever evolving QOTSA lineup.   <br /> <br />With this in mind I was a bit disappointed with the main DVD portion as I've been a bit bored with QOTSA on their last 2 trips to the DC area supporting Lullabies to Paralyze.  They've definitely lost their edge but hopefully they'll recover.
B000000OEI|5|It's a great soundtrack. I espcially love the historical roots it has I don't think most people realize that some of the vocal tracks on the CD are the US Naval Academy's official Hymn. The music truely conveys the depth  and importance of the job of the Navy's most elite sailors.
B0063IH60K|5|Love the Solitaire by MobilityWare.  It's fast and fun, a great way to pass some time when waiting for someone or something.
B0053O89KG|5|It was an amazing season of Castle with every episode carrying over to the amazing season ending episode.  Love the bloopers too...always a great addition to the dvds.
B00GDFVTZQ|5|Love this game!  If you are a fan of the Rayman Jungle Run, or the PC and console based Legends or Origins, then you will love this game!
B004F1F32A|5|I like this movie... Even if there is some bad acting involved! I like Liam Neeson, even if his character is always the same!
B002UWH8P6|5|I really enjoyed this show. The actors are superb. There are a few minor things I don't like, but I still think it deserves 5 stars.
B00KG2SXII|2|I guess it was worth watching but it is so dark that you can't see what's going on sometimes.
B00008H2LB|5|Great album that has let us relive one of the best live performances I have seen.
B004SIIBGU|5|Cool app
B00IX9UTLU|5|I have read many books like this. I love the way she writes and the trip she takes you on. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys great sex and has demons of their own.
B00004Y7SF|2|This is a terrible album! Do not buy it. I LOVE Christina, I have all her CDs. But this is a mess. I was so mad the first time I heard this, she butchers every song on it. If you want to hear the classics done right, don't buy this CD. It may be her kind of Christmas, but It's definitely not mine!
B00BB8UJKG|5|This is a coming-of-age movie for a group of 28-year olds from a small Canadian town who haven't yet grown up and are about to attend their 10th high school reunion. The movie is very well done, has a wonderful cast who play their respective parts with sensitivity and understanding, and there is not much of an overall plot besides growing up to meet their age there are a number of sub stories going on with the individual members of the group of former classmates that are interesting in their developments during the movie. The best dialog in the movie takes place between Timothy Hutton's character, a musician who has settled in New York but returned for the reunion, and a 13-year old played by Natalie Portman in one of her first roles. Watch for a cameo appearance of Steve Costanzo who plays one of the old drunks at the bar in a local tavern.
B000JLSLZQ|5|Excellent Film that I watch in my home theater 60&#34;, everything is crystal clear, and wonderfully crisp sound.  We watch the movie version a couple a times a year.  Just wonderful.
0547564651|5|Excellent information!
B000RLHDUM|3|A stylish remake of the '68 classic that although well crafted, still seems a bit lifeless when compared to the original; it's no one's fault, as the two leads were well chosen and carry their load easily - it's more that the kind of aloof charm McQueen carried off so well seems just a bit more forced in Mr. Brosnan's (otherwise capable) hands. Still definitely worth a look, and especially for those unfamiliar with the original.
B006YTTVHO|3|He discussed what others' mindset may be.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|Very enjoyable read. Didn't except the outcome of her actual relationship with her Mom. Look forward to the next journey.
0689853491|5|Someone gave my son this book when he was younger but even I used this book for inspiration when I was having hard times. I still repeat a few of the lines when times are stressful. We can't go over it, we can't go under it, we've got to go through it! Amazing book even for an adult.
0743298020|5|I found myself sucked into Diane Setterfield's dark and gothic world. Sure, many of the characters are strange and unbelievable but that's what the book is all about. The truth is boring...so why not just tell a good ghost story instead?
B00L9B7IKE|5|Riveting! I could not put it down. Be careful who you trust in life. Be even more careful who you love.
B00F8L2VO4|5|Most language programs focus only on pictures and you have to guess a words meaning from it so if it shows a smiling person running the word could be smile run person or whatever.  This app doesn't just do that though, it exposes you to the language, tells you exactly what you're learning, and breaks it up into organized segments.  You learn how to say words, their meaning, and grammar patterns, easily.  This free app is better than most programs that cost hundreds of dollars.
B00004ZAV3|5|Appart from a couple 4-star cuts, this record is just amazing. It has all The Beatles' singles that went up to #1, in US and UK charts, arranged chronologically.<br /><br />You may like it more or less, but you can't deny all the songs here defined the whole sound of contemporary pop/rock music, even till today, no matter how hard the critics are.<br /><br />It may still lack a few other excellent songs from the band deserving to be on a greatest hits collection, but you may still try to get them sepparately by looking for the career albums.<br /><br />These are just #1s. Not more. No less.
0470876417|5|I recommend this book to all the startups that I consult - the business model generation diagram, if made into a wall poster, works very well to understand the cash flow and the flow of work. Excellent book.
B00FAHYNYC|5|Met my expectations
B003ES61EE|5|Great product, second one I have purchased(lost my last one)... I would recommend it to anyone that uses cameras often.
B00170MYIS|4|This battery is very good and the price is great.  Just as good as the original battery that came with my camera....thank you...!!
B00IMOVPUU|4|This is very fun game to play whenever you are, in the office appointment, on a line, anywhere. You will love it
B00DJFIMW6|5|So addictive!  Perfect mix of simple play and challenging content.  But the best part, of course, is  YOU GET TO BE A MINION!!!  BANANA!!!!
B0027BOL4G|5|I use this in my writing classroom, but I'd not hesitate to recommend it to anyone & everyone -- we should ALL understand just how ugly our food production systems have become. Our safety and our health are determined by profits and market analysis not by doctors and nutritionists. This documentary uses a great blend of interviews, graphics, and visuals of the inside of food production venues to SHOW just how bad things are. It's divided into segments of 15-30 minutes each, so it's easy to break up for classroom discussion.
030758836X|5|Wow.Wow. Double Wow. I did not expect the second half of the book.  It is hard to say a lot without giving anything away but this book is definitely my favorite of the summer.  If this isn't made into a movie, it will be a shame.
B00V4JHNZG|2|Not much of a story line.
B00AYR2FOI|5|Boz just keeps going--he's so versatile. This album seems to tip its hat to Memphis icons--Al Green-flavored tracks, some delicious, grinding blues, a bit of Louis Jordan. A musical tour of one of our great musical cities.
B008JGSM6G|5|At first thought it was going to be a washout. But the longer I played the more challenging it became.
B00IIBAF0S|5|First of all, I will say that I *really* enjoyed this book - and I've read several thousand books in my lifetime (mostly science-fiction and fantasy). So I was curious as to what the reviewers who gave it only 2 or 3 stars had to say about it.<br /><br />There are several points made by negative reviewers that I'd like to address:<br /><br />* Criticism: The author does not provide a detailed explanation of unusual terminology, and a lot of the world she's created is therefore hard to understand.<br />* My response: This is true. The author has avoided including huge info-dumps and does not give detailed explanations of what various words mean, of the  cultural and governmental background for the various alien races, or of exactly who and what the main character is. Instead, as the story unfolds, the reader gradually puts all the pieces together in building an understanding of the protagonist's true nature, what has happened in the past, and details of this universe. I'm not a fan of big info-dumps - I think it's a lazy writing technique - and I actually quite enjoyed the mystery of puzzling out what things mean and how everything works, gradually building up a rich world full of unique customs and objects.<br /><br />* Criticism: The author does not explain how the various types of technology actually work, and their scientific plausibility is questionable.<br />* My response: This is also true. If you're one of those people who eagerly pores over schematics and detailed explanations of ships, weapons, power sources, and battles, you will probably find this book rather unsatisfying. However, if your primary enjoyment in a book comes from the action, the character interaction, and the psychology behind what happens, I think you will find this book quite absorbing and enjoyable.<br /><br />* Criticism: The book is written using almost exclusively female pronouns, which is incredibly distracting.<br />* My response: Right at first, this approach *is* incongruous and a bit distracting. But it didn't take too long for me to just accept that whenever the word &#34;she&#34; appeared, it might be referring to a male or a female - and that gender was not really important in terms of understanding the characters and their actions. And then I realized: we read books all the time where the pronouns &#34;he&#34;, &#34;him&#34;, and &#34;his&#34; are used almost exclusively, but this is not distracting because we as a society accept the male pronouns as a neutral default when gender is unknown. By removing gendering from the story, the author makes us able to concentrate on characters' actions and motivations without imparting our own gender biases on their words, deeds, and roles.<br /><br />* Criticism: The book alternates between flashbacks and current events, making it hard to keep straight what is happening in the various timelines.<br />* My response: Yes, the narrative does alternate in this way - but in my opinion, (and I've read a significant number of books which employ this literary technique) the author does this quite successfully. I never had a problem recognizing in which timestream I was reading - and I did not find it difficult after a switch to pick up where a timestream had left off.<br /><br />* Criticism: The book is written in a rather dispassionate and unemotional style, making it hard to empathize with or care about the characters.<br />* My response: This is certainly true about the writing style; however, as the book is written from the first person perspective of the protagonist, the style is a reflection of the narrator's thought process. The protagonist does not perceive herself/himself as a human being, and describes even illogical events and actions in a logical manner. As the story comes to its fruition, we come to realize that, despite the narrative's dispassionate nature, the narrator is far more &#34;human&#34; and compassionate than many of the humans with whom she/he has interacted. I found myself caring a great deal about the protagonist, very early in the story.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: This novel employs some interesting and unusual storytelling methods to create an intriguing, absorbing narrative. While it's not a full-on action-adventure, I still found the story gripping enough that I could not put the book down. If you are looking for a fast, easy read - this is probably not that novel. But, in my opinion, the emotional payoff for being willing to invest some thought and attention in this book is large and satisfying.g a great deal about the protagonist, very early in the story.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: This novel employs some interesting and unusual storytelling methods to create an intriguing, absorbing narrative.

B00AESN8XY|5|The complexity of this game is amazing. Watching the various factors interact gets so interesting I keep losing track of my Devious Plan and the next thing I know some annoying<br /> scientist in Finland has cured my beautiful disease!
B0055PGUYU|5|Helps understanding of habit development and how we can change or influence ours and others habits.
0440246024|5|It was very good as are all his books.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This was a love story every one should read. It was everything rolled into one. All I have so say is if you don't read it you will never know a great book!
0452289963|5|Simply a must read for all earthly beings. I'm going to read it again to try to sink more of it into my 3rd dimensional brain.
0486268659|5|I bought 5 of these books to be an addition to Christmas baskets and it was shipped perfectly on time and is a great valuefor money and a great addition to my gifts.
B00IHMEAYA|5|At first, I had a hard time sticking with this book.  But when I went back to it after a few weeks, I loved it from there to the end.  It is masterfully written and with such care and love for the characters.  I didn't know much about this aspect of World War II, so it was also a learning experience.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Easy to read, good story. I liked the characters and although it was sad you felt okay about it in the end.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Kept you guessing to the end. Have recommended to my book club.

0792151712|3|James Cameron is best known for directing such action slash science fiction classics as The Terminator (1984) and Aliens (1986). As a result a love story between an<BR>upper class women Rose (Kate Winslet) and a lower class free spirit Jake (Leonardo DiCaprio) constructed around the sinking of a the supposedly \\"unsinkable\\" ship in<BR>1912 could be seen as a change of pace. It is a change of pace which works, albeit it not completely.<BR> The story of the Titanic is a very familiar one and has developed its own mythology.<BR>Cameron allows one character to helpfully outline what happened on that fateful night and thus allows the viewer to concentrate upon the love story between the star<BR>crossed lovers  instead of worrying about the sinking of the ship. There is also asubplot about the fiancee of Rose Cal (Billy Zane) and henchman Lovejoy (David Warner) trying to prevent the lovers from being together.<BR> Titanic really is a return to the old fashioned epics that Hollywood used to make. The film is at it best when it is concentrating upon the recreation of the microcosm of<BR>Edwardian society that Titanic was and the actual sinking of the boat. Unfortunately Cameron is not as good a writter as a director and the dialogue is often risible. Saying that though Cameron manages, like Neil Jordan in Interview with a Vampire (1994), to create some memorable set pieces, for example, when Jake and Rose descend in tothe engine room of the ship it resembles hell with the red of the flames or seeing the<BR>bodies of dead people in the first class accommodation and of course of sinking of the ship. He also manages to convey the sheer terror the people must have felt as the ship<BR>sank.<BR> The performances are merely adequate though Warner as Cal's villainous henchmen gives an enjoyable performance. Saying that though the actors and actresses are merely there to show case the special effects. They are mostly excellent though some<BR>have aged badly. As an amalgam of a love story and a disaster movie it is not bad.When Cameron moves on to politics it flounders badly and he is on much more shaky ground. <BR> The film was hyped a lot and it possibly did not deserve the shed loads of Oscars it got. It is not one of the best films of the 90s or even the year it was made, but it is not<BR>bad. The scale of the film making which Cameron has made is similar to the films which Cecil De Mille was making and for that he is to be applauded. Titanic is not innovative, but it is not meant to be new and within the narrow parameters it sets for<BR>itself it works.
B000JIHP88|4|My baby loves it. The music it actually plays does not go with the composer, but my kid won't know the difference. It's still working even with all the hand wacking it gets. I wish that they would make it so that it wouldn't mess up my wooden crib. Maybe like a soft material other than plastic that would protect the crib from getting all scratched up.
B00004XONN|1|As someone who considers himself a die-hard Radiohead fan, I immediately ordered this album the instant I heard about its upcoming release. Upon its arrival, I rushed out to the car to give a listen.<br />Sadly, after forcing myself to leave this disk in the changer for the past four days, little of it has grown on me. Things start off nicely, with the eerie soup of &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot; recalling much of the feel of earlier works, with some new textures. A perfect song for brooding while driving really fast. But from there, things mellow into an eerily calm, unemotional stupor. C'mon Thom! Is someone slipping you guys valium/prozac? Where is the energy, the &quot;bite&quot; of the music we've come to expect from Radiohead? For the first time ever, I'm disappointed.
B008AK8FHM|5|Wonderful read that inspires
B009329Y30|4|I guess you kind of know from the beginning how it will end, but there are some unexpected twists and turns along the way ....
0786867973|5|I would love to find more cookbook authors like Nigella.  She is just so chatty and funny and real.  Her recipes are yummy - the pictures are lovely, and the book is so reassuringly simple.  Pistachio macaroons, anyone?
B000I2J0W4|5|To be honest, when I first viewed this film in the early eighties, I thought that Stanley Kubrick had completely ruined Stephen King's best novel. But, now that i'm able to mentally segregate the film from the book, this is a classic horror film with a terrific DVD transfer that I saw last night. As for the movie, simply take a recovering alcoholic prone to visions and flashbacks (Nicholson), pair him with a son who's got many problems himself despite psychiatric reassurances(Lloyd) and bundle this up with a sane mother who looks insane(Duvall))and you've got all the ingredients for a winning tri-fecta at sea level. Add a secluded mountaintop hotel with a notorious past  that this trio will inhabit alone for the next six months, and you have all that you really need to know. Now, go buy a perfect stocking stuffer for the \\"King\\" residing in you.
B004SJ3AXI|4|Good game and appropriate for my childrens age not to mention the season in which they received their Kindles. I even enjoyed playing it.
B002GSXKN8|5|Love all the movies on 1 DVD, great value!!  Fast shipping, great packaging!!!  It was a great Christmas gift for my husband, he loved it
0316098337|5|I read this for my book club and really enjoyed it. I definitely recommend it...especially if you are in a book club.
0451457994|4|It took me a long time to actually read this book. Surprisingly, I found it to be much less cohesive and engaging as a story than Kubrick's movie. That's one of the rare things you can say about Kubrick, he's one of the only directors who makes movies better than the original books. The storyline is wonderful and the book includes vastly more detail, background, and philosophy, but overall it feels like a collection of elements, not so much a cohesive narrative. It's still a fascinating and wonderful book, but after reading it twice and watching the movie at least a dozen times, I prefer Kubrick's movie.<br /><br />In short:<br />Definitely worth reading, but more a collection of ideas than a cohesive narrative. Kubrick's film is much better as a story.

B001PJRAUS|3|I heard about this show and watched it online (sidereel.com) expecting to hate it, but I must admit that it sucked me in and forced me to watch it! Was it the handsome Elliot Cowan sizzling around as Darcy, the spunky if misguided heroine, or the unpredictable plot twists caused by a modern Austen fan bumbling through the world she'd only dreamed of? I can't be sure, but I have to say that I couldn't wait to see where the story would go next. Is it ridiculous? Absolutely. Will you feel foolish trying to describe it to your seriously literary friends? Believe it. Will you be embarrassingly hooked on it and want to see it again? Maybe. Whenever I engaged my brain I felt like I was watching some pretty crazy fan fiction, but nonetheless watch it I did. While some may find it a hack job that butchers their favorite book, it seemed to me more of a musing on the idea of what would it REALLY be like to be in this world so many of us like to read about. I will admit I wasn't crazy about the ending, but I don't want to put up a spoiler. So my final analysis is that I didn't really admire it but I did enjoy watching it. UPDATE: I ordered the dvd from Amazon and am pleased with my purchase. I did find the dvd at a local bookstore, but the price was double Amazon's, so I recommend getting it here, folks. The dvd contained two extras: an interesting \\"making of\\" feature and a trailer. I did notice that the dvd version was edited differently than the version I saw on sidereel, namely the loss of a scene where the heroine sings the 60's pop song \\"Downtown.\\" That was a bummer. I can't say what else may be different, but apparently this version isn't exactly the same as what was broadcast in the UK. That being said, it's a good buy for a fun movie that comes in at about 3 hours, so that's two movie nights at my house! (The dvd version is not separated into episodes.)And the movie looks much lovelier on my tv than it did on my little computer screen. The colors and sets are very nice, and Elliot Cowan is a very handsome Darcy indeed!and Elliot Cowan is a very handsome Darcy indeed!
B00CH26TL8|5|It is a great game I recommend everyone who likes puzzle games to play it. It is  like candy crush saga but better.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|It's just a really cool game
B00VRYCGLO|4|Good game!!!
B00NOPQU2K|2|A twisted, Gone Girl style novel that is definitely a page turner but left me feeling a bit sick, scared of humanity, and wishing I had the last hour of my life back.
B000QRIGLC|5|Marcus Luttrell and the rest of the U.S. Navy SEALs are truly the best fighting force in the world.  Luttrell has memorialized his fallen comrades in a way that only he could because he was the lone survivor.  I think this book should be required reading for every member of Congress as well as the President as well as the U.S. media.  The Islmofacist don't honor the Geneva Convention and our troops shouldn't be hamstrung by it when fighting them.  The jihadists are unconventional and should be fought using unconventional methods especially where rules of engagement are concerned.  Luttrell makes this point very clear as well as the undaunted courage and fighting spirit shown by his fallen brothers and him.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
B00MNQ94WO|5|I can't listen to it enough! Great songs! Lenny is still as amazing as ever!
B008Z9YGEE|3|weak
B00007E7K0|5|It is perfect for its purpose.
B000GUJZ4G|1|Don't get me wrong... I like Keanu, I like Patrick, but this is one of the worst movies... EVER. I know Keanu can act - I've seen him do it, I just don't know why he didn't in this movie. I also know Lori Petty can act, but again... she chose not to. Worst dialogue ever, worst portrayal of surfers ever... many, many \\"worst ever\\" trophies go to this movie. If you want to see Keanu in action, watch Constantine, and skip this aweful movie.
B00H83EUL2|5|Watched it as soon as it arrived. I am retired. Can hardly beat Sandra Bullock. Nearly lost my breath in those scenes of danger. (all of it) Any of our children could experience some of this. Don't like to think about it
B00LD1OHE0|5|I'm never, ever disappointed with a Colleen Hoover book. I know they will grip me, push me, and make me think. This story- Auburn, Owen, and Adam- the way they are intertwined and how fate has put them in each other's lives is kind of an amazing thing, God bless Colleen Hoover and her way with words.
031606792X|5|I personally thought that Breaking Dawn was excellent. Its even my favorite and I'm an older reader, so when I got hooked on the Twilight Saga- I was surprised. I think people should back off from Stephenie Meyer's back for her choice in plot. If anything, I see potential for working off from Breaking Dawn--I really really hope she does. She's a brilliant writer who creates brilliant plots.
B003KLGKAA|2|This review is for the first episode (\\"Voyage of the Damned\\") of season one.  It was absolutely THE WORST episode of Doctor Who ever.  I love Doctor Who.  I love David Tennant.  I hated this episode with a burning passion.  We went from one of the best written, most creative, and best acted episodes yet (the season 3, 3 part closer) to the absolute *worst.*  \\"Voyage of the Damned\\" was poorly written, dreadfully cliche, heavy handed, juvenile, hackneyed, and just overall crap.  Judging from the rest of the reviews raving about Seasons Four (incidently, why are all the reviews for this episode reviews of the *entire season*?), things promise to pick up, but if it's more of the same, I'm going to be very, very annoyed and sad.
B00FATEJYE|4|When I installed the updates I lost my lol 32 superman  25 boss Grundy and 32 silver black Adam ...I'm super sad right now :( other than that it's a great game
B000X2H8G4|3|The headphones are beyond large (and I've got a pretty big head,lol) they constantly shift fwd and fall off. I've nearly slammed them in every door, or dropped them in every gap (even over water) since purchasing them. The amplifier works OK but kills the battery in less than twenty four hours if you're a person like me who needs them on a regular basis. Otherwise, they get the job done OK, just not great...
B0036BK6MW|5|This is a good movie with a little humor and a good story.  I enjoyed it, and will watch it again. Thanks. Bobby J.
1400049628|5|Taking zombie survival seriously and it was fun. If you read this you must read World War Z, or vice versa.
B00JH3S0AI|2|I kept waiting for something to happen.  And it kept not happening. The end.
B00BPDR3F6|5|I enjoyed every minute of reading this and didn't want it to end!  The depth of involvement with the characters is remarkable.
B003RNZDKY|5|dope per usual. can't miss with this one, especially if you're a Roots fan... solid album
B004FGMDOQ|5|this book was amazing i couldnt put it down kept me on the edge of my seat
B00081U7HC|5|I watch this over and over, great movie
0399230033|5|Cute illustrations and a fun story. We're glad to have this in our collection of children's books!
B008NW67E0|5|There isn't one song on this CD that isn't good. All of them flow together wonderfully. Hasn't left my car since I got it :)
B00L9B7IKE|4|Starts like a worrisome chic flick but quickly turns into a complicated murder mystery with some of life's most desperate emotional conditions clouding the culprit.
B00AQ3K8IU|1|This book was hopeless and it was a stupid pick on my behalf and I will never read Colleen Hoover again
B0018QQQK8|5|This book is great, really a must read, now must rent the movie and see if it compares. Definitely recommend this book.
B00E7RZEI0|3|I love the background music--very calming. The game itself I haven't quite figured out yet, but it's worth looking into.
B0073QNIH6|4|this is very realistic and finely crafted.  stands up well.  my only complaints are that the teeth are tiny and the toy is smaller than I expected.
B00BP4X7TG|5|So funny and original! Refreshing!
B009LYQE2E|5|I love one piece and every one knows FiguArts gives good quality for a good price... just get it if you are a one piece fan :D
B000AADYRQ|3|I am confused that so many people gave this album five stars and called it an extension of \\"Transatlanticism\\". I didn't think \\"Transatlanticism\\" was that great. (Good, yes). I knew after that album came out that Death Cab was changing. Also, I don't think it's fair to compare them to The Postal Service. <br /> <br />\\"Plans\\" upset me off because it feels like a cop out. Like they just threw the songs together. Death Cab is one of my favorite bands of all time. When I compare their last two albums to \\"Something About Airplanes\\" or even \\"The Photo Album\\" (though these two albums were only released two yaers apart, their sounds are completely different), I can't believe it's the same band. <br /> <br />Ben's lyrics used to be so insightful: Sadly sweet mixed with an uncommon sort of hope over catchy melodies. There used to be something cathartic and specific about his words. (Refer to \\"Styrofoam Plates\\" off the aforementioned \\"The Photo Album\\": A song about his deadbeat alcohlic father who died and his internal struggle with it. Or \\"Company Calls Epilogue\\" [\\"We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes\\"], about the love of his life getting married to someone else.) Now they seem somewhat detached and vague. <br /> <br />\\"Crooked Teeth\\" is my favorite (mainly because it's somewhat dancey). \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\" is also good. <br /> <br />Suffice it to say that Death Cab For Cutie's sound and style is always changing (I wouldn't use the word \\"evolving\\"). Buy this album if you like the singles off of it. Though, I wouldn't recommend it for those who yell out requests for \\"Photobooth\\" at their live shows.
B00EHMFC78|5|As always, Baldacci is a great read.
B00005JKNF|3|I was so disappointed in this picture.  I looked forward to seeing it - never got a chance to see it on the big screen - so I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.  I am such a big fan of British movies, especially mysteries, but there was just something missing from this one. I'm not really sure what it was - the acting was great but story was just OK.  I'm sure others liked it better than I did.

B00BRUQ7ZY|3|This book is not the detailed story of the historical Jesus that I was expecting based on reviews I have read. Almost half the book is Jewish history based to a large extent on Josephus.
0316067601|5|I have always been a fan of our military, our soldiers, our intelligence and our President George W Bush.  But after reading Marcus's book, I am an absolute devotee of the US Navy SEALs. It instills an education as to the training and the dedication these men have to serve and protect our country, our freedoms and our future.  Any liberal idiot who thinks that we have no reason to protect ourselves , especially against afghanie and pakastani and Syrian and Iraqi muslim radicalism , needs to read this book over and over and over again.  George W Bush is a man , a fighter , a protector and will be seen as a much better President of the United States than the liberal media has awarded him in the present.  I am proud and grateful that he was our leader, and to these men, I thank you for my life, my family's life and our future.  Your fight is not in vain. Please know that. Thank you Marcus.

B00AEFXKOO|1|Amazon unfortunately has a policy of selling returned Blu-ray titles as new. If your Blu-ray is shrink wrapped, it's not new. It's been returned and Amazon has deemed it appropriate to shrink wrap it and resell it as new. The majority of the time you can actually see bits of the original packaging still glued to the Blu-ray case. Amazon is not alone, the good amount of online retailers have adopted this practice.<br /><br />My copy arrived shrink wrapped, 1 of the 2 discs inside was scratched and had finger prints all over it. Amazon is playing the odds hoping you won't notice. In short, if your Blu-ray is shrink wrapped, it's best to ask for a new item instead. Amazon needs to be careful with practices like this, things like this can lead to painful Class Action.
B005K17RU0|1|I loved the original version that came with my kindle but then the ad got bigger and I couldn't get to settings, so I bought the premium. Well that doesn't have the information I was using it for and I can't read the type without a magnifying glass. Ok, so I saw there was an update for this and now I have the same problem. Accuweather has rendered this app totally useless to me. I would pay anything to get this back to the original usable version but I understand programming logic, if it works let's break it ... right?
B00005JMFQ|2|After all the gushy reviews for this movie, I couldn't wait to rent a copy.  I like gushy, feel-good movies, and that's what this movie purported itself to be.  When it was over and the credits began to roll, I found myself sort of lost in confusion, which I abruptly ended with a \\"hmmph...\\" and a shrug.  This is a completely British movie, and maybe it makes more sense to Brits.  After watching this movie I have deduced that it takes two things to tickle an Englishperson's ribs: a lot of cussing, and a lot of sex.  For me, the cussing was way overdone, and it actually weighed down what is supposed to be a light storyline.  There was also too many mini-plots squeezed into one film.  I kept thinking at the end that they would all somehow tie together, and some did, but that only left me wondering about the ones that were left hanging...for example, Laura Linney's pathetic character, who spends much of her time pining and primping for a colleague, then when she finally gets her chance with him, she can't seem to stop taking cell calls from her mentally ill brother (by the way, no mental institution is going to give a patient that much free will with a phone).  Each time I hoped she would reach for the \\"off\\" button on her phone, she instead answered it with a cheery \\"Hi babe!\\".  Emma Thompson's character also came off as quite pathetic, as she copes with her lukewarm marriage to a middle-aged man with a young nympho for a secretary.  I kept hoping that her marriage would be made better somehow by the crisis, but it never was.  The goofy, horny, US-bound waiter was just, well, goofy.  He didn't really add anything to the movie.  Hugh Grant seemed like he was attempting to star in \\"Notting Hill, Part Two\\".  His stuffy \\"romance\\" with his 20-year younger hostess was rather cold.  So, what did make this movie worth a star?  The storylines involving Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, and the young man who was desperately in love with his best friend's new wife.  Everyone, and everything, else was utterly forgettable, and only served as distractions.  The intermittent blips of soft-core porn were just icky.  What made this movie worth its second star?  It gave me something to do while I was doing laundry.

B004GUSG4M|5|Found this book at a bookstore and read the first chapter in an aisle, got on my phone and downloaded to my kindle. Wow! Fast paced never boring good book. Read the last half in one sitting and now can't sleep I'm so wound up. You will like this book.

0425152251|3|John Doe walked to his mailbox, and found the following letter from an unknown person: <br /> <br />Sophie's World: <br /> <br />This book is no different than what everyone else says. It is essentially an EXTREMELY basic philosophy textbook stuck into an EXTREMELY basic novel. The extremely rudimentary language of the novel (possibly due to a poor translation from the Norwegian) and the slightly less than average plot (an unknown philosopher sends Sophie letters that cover the history of philosophy) make it worth wondering: why am I not just reading biography or philosophy web pages about each of these philosophers or, better yet, just read a philosophy textbook? Had the history of philosophy been woven into this book more fluidly, it might have turned out better. It seemed to me like the plot was an excuse for the meat of the book, the philosophy. This book does have some redeeming qualities, however. The philosophical matter is, for the most part, very interesting and worthy for everyone at any age to consider. The only problem with this novel is that it is a novel at all. It reads like an episode of \\"The Magic School Bus,\\" where the fictional part of the story is merely a gimmick to keep one's attention. If I had not needed to read it for school (International Baccalaureate Theory of Knowledge - an advanced high school philosophy-ish course), I would have skipped the plot and just read the philosophy part, which is conveniently differentiated from the rest of the novel by the use of a different font. <br /> <br />Who knows, maybe I just missed the point, but it seems like an extremely contrived novel with the information part just jammed into it. If you don't mind poor writing and want to read a little about philosophy, go for it. If you do mind poor writing and want to read a little about philosophy, go for it and skip the plot part. The plot part, though, is very useless except to serve as an excuse to bring up philosophical questions such as \\"why are Legos the most ingenious toys?\\" Why does there have to be a plot? <br /> <br />John wondered: what the heck is this doing in my mailbox, and who is this person? Tune in next chapter for more reviews and a little more plot! <br />

B00910Y1OQ|5|This one is very easy to pick up and play and is very well done. I had picked this up as a free app of the day and would definitely reccomend it at the full purchase price.
B00AIUUXHC|5|It is awesome. There a tiny bit of blood effects.<br />It is basically life of a shark.
B000GTLQXU|4|After all the criticism this movie attracted, I'll admit that I didn't have high hopes.  It was, however, better than I expected. <br /> <br />For those who, like me, haven't seen the original and are flying pretty much blind in considering this film, \\"Poseidon\\" tells the story of the cruise ship Poseidon.  After meeting a rogue wave, the ship capsizes, killing many passengers and stranding the rest inside the overturned boat.  A small group of passengers, led by Dylan (Josh Lucas) and Robert (Kurt Russell), leave the rest of the survivors and set out on a perilous journey to escape the sinking ship before it's too late. <br /> <br />Let me begin by saying that this movie is extremely intense.  The 98 minutes of this film consist of nail-biting situation after nail-biting situation after nail-biting situation.  If you're looking for a movie that doesn't halt for a whole lot of talking, this is the one to see. <br /> <br />I've read many other reviews that complain about the acting, and I couldn't agree less.  I think the acting was pretty darn good.  What can be expected with cast members like Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, and Richard Dreyfuss? <br /> <br />The criticism that I will agree with involves the beginning sequence.  The director obviously wanted to \\"wow\\" viewers with the vastness of the ship and accordingly did a long pan around the entire thing.  Of course, all this was achieved through special effects, and with today's special effects, I would have expected more.  The ship looked fake and even slightly cartoonish.  The later special effects (ie. the ship getting hit by the wave and the ship slowly sinking) are not as disappointing, simply because the plot takes over and doesn't leave you too much time to consider the special effects shortcomings. <br /> <br />As an action-adventure film, this movie delivers.  It doesn't deliver too much depth or character-development, but it makes up for these in pure intensity. <br /> <br />4-stars - watch it,it's worth your while.
B0074VTHKM|3|Good. I recommend it.

1589795474|5|I recommend this book to close friends and family because it explains how millionaires are made by responsible, frugal behaviors and not just inheritance, luck or a few select careers. It reinforces what I've observed in my own life that if you save and make wise decisions (delay some gratifications) you can accumulate wealth and attain financial freedom as you grow older. My only complaint is with the acronyms. I would often confuse UAWs and PAWs. However, that's probably more my issue and not enough to take away from the wisdom contained in this book.
0670038040|5|Since his inaugural case in  the 1970's Rumpole has busily defended one or another of the Timson clan (a large and industrious family of South London thieves) on various charges.  More than one of the cases Rumpole has previously chronicled involves a Timson unwisely befriending, trusting, and being betrayed by a Molloy (another large and industrious family of South London thieves).  Rumpole brilliantly wins each case by convincing the jury that the Timsons and Molloys are like the Hatfields and McCoys, and that the conniving Molloy has framed the hapless Timson.<br /><br />This case serves up a slight twist on that old plot, with Rumpole defending a Timson who unwisely befriended another Molloy, and at the same time defending a Pakistani doctor who married a Timson and whose affairs also cross paths with the Molloys.  Besides bringing Rumpole, the Timsons, and the Molloys into the 21st Century, Mortimer also manages to mix in huge doses of critique of anti-terrorism laws.  He's not too heavy-handed with his criticism, and the political commentary does not detract from the story.<br /><br />The first Rumpole stories were complex pieces of work, with numerous subplots involving Rumpole's colleagues swirling around the main mystery.  Mortimer's later efforts have been less complex, with Rumpole's chamber-mates at Number 4 Equity Court receding to the background as Rumpole's relationship with his wife Hilda (She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed) receives more attention.  The trend continues in this latest effort, with Soapy Sam Ballard, Phillida Erskine-Brown, Claude Erskine-Brown, Hoskins, and Henry the clerk receding into cardboard figures with little depth.  Still, \\"The Reign of Terror\\" was so engaging that I read it in one sitting.
B00785P2QC|5|This game is much more fun then the free Virtual City game. You can get all of the buildings on this just on the free game. Instead of just one little area you can expand your city's area.
B004XJRQUQ|4|I haven't read a book since HGttG. That was a few years ago back in highschool. Mainly read Hunger Games to impress a girl, but ended up liking it. It did not impress the girl however. I feel I read it for the perfect motivation and recomend you to give it a try. Hopefully it works better for you. Oh, SPOILER ALERT, everyone dies.
B000SEFNMS|4|I remember reading Krakauer's article about Chris McCandless in Outside Magazine about the time my service in the U.S. ARMY was coming to an end. I had a very harsh opinion of him at the time as I was about his age and had spent the better part of a year in the desert having served in the Gulf War. One thing five years in the Army taught me was to respect nature as it can humble you in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />Fast forward twenty-five years and Into the Wild pops up in my suggested reading after reading A River Runs Through It. Now I'm a father of two sons and my heart has softened with time and experience.<br /><br />Knowing how the story ends,  I kept thinking of the many corollaries between McCandless and myself. And then juxtaposing them with the knowledge of how hard parenthood can be and just kept thinking of how tragic the story is. That Chris couldn't go to either of his parents and get the other side of the story.<br /><br />I feel certain that while McCandless died while living out his dreams, he most certainly died with a heavy heart.

B00FAPF5U0|5|This is one of the most addictive &#34;match 3-type&#34; games. The developers have done it right. They have made a game with varied game play, multiple levels and various goals. Many of these types of games get monotonous over time, but Candy Crush Saga has found the right formula.<br /><br />Any time I go into a restaurant, one of the waiters will come over an discuss what level they are on or what level their friend is on. It is definitely a conversation starter. LOL<br /><br />I don't sync it with my Facebook or other social media because then it syncs ALL your games on all devices. I don't want that because if I get stuck on level 100 on my iPhone, I can still play level 46 on my Kindle or level 55 on my iPad. (Thanks Sis for the heads up).<br /><br />Great gameplay and graphics. Some of the levels are super hard to get through!
B00992CF6W|5|I can't wait for the 1.0.0 update I hope it has Redstone and pistols best game ever
B009KHDT0C|4|It looked like a really funny movie and it held up. Not my favorite movie, but I definitely would watch it again.
B00004XPPC|4|What an intricate movie hidden by such a simple story line driven by \\"complex\\" characters (on surface their motivation are easily understood and acceptable).  The story is about duty, honor, and appearances. What adds to this movie is the humor in it, witty and practical (the \\"with a parachute?\\" is priceless). They do not and probably cannot make movies like this anymore. As far as adventure goes buddy-action flicks and even romance-action movies rule the day.<br /><br />There are essential 2 protagonists in this movie. The American \\"Commander\\" and the English Colonel, both fight to keep their appearances up despite their difficulty fortunes. Both characters motivations can be understood, although it may take more thought to accomplish that of the English Colonel's. Central to the action is the bridge itself, representing perhaps a kind of monument to the people that fight wars.<br />The film desperately needed a technical advisor concerning its commando team. In fact this is where 20 minutes of film could be cut. Too much focus was put on the team and their actions in route which only slowed the film down and misdirected it. Its only use was to quickly showcase the American's philosophy on war and life compared to what he thought of the Brits version (the scene lasted less than a minute).<br /><br />The end has an interesting twist that will have you yelling with excitement at the screen. The only logical conclusion for the ending and what the bridge represents is madness.<br /><br />With a playing time of almost 3 hours this movie is completely worth it. Fans of war films, drama, and adventure should like this despite the lack of modern tastes in production style.
B00KA7JIII|3|Nice ideea,  too few levels.<br />My kids love playing it over and over but constantly asking for new levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is so much fun!
B000M06K5C|5|It's been forever since I've been excited about a CD. Not having heard their first album, I came to Bloc Party with just the two or three tunes they play on rotation on KCRW. Beautiful, beautiful, mature stuff. Anthems really. Plenty of that deliciously self-important post-punk. Layered guitar and lyrics resplendent with subtext.
B008RA3X5E|5|I hate to see this alarm in the morning, but I hate to see any alarm when it goes off.  All that being said the blue light has a great dimming feature. The wake up alarm is not obnoxious as was my previous alarm clock app.
1451627289|5|What if you could go back in time to one of the most horrific events in the last century and have an opportunity to stop it? Would you do it? 11/22/63 is the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated and in 11/22/63 Stephen King tells the story of Jake Epping, an English teacher from 2011 suddenly found himself in an era before smart phones, the civil rights movement, and the Vietnam War. With all the conspiracy theories around the assassination of Kennedy, how will Epping know what to do?<br /><br />Remember, Stephen King wrote this novel!  The Past is obdurate. It doesn't want to change and actively tries to thwart anyone attempting to change it. The more epic the change, the more the Past tries to stop the change. JFK's assassination was about as big of a change as you can imagine. Jake Epping experiences the wrath of the Past.<br /><br />In addition to being a great story, the book was a highly enjoyable trip down memory lane to a time before the turmoil of the 60's in the USA. King reminds us of the fashions, products, language, and even culture of the early 1960's. It may have been a simpler time, but with a 2012 perspective some elements of the time may not be as attractive as we think.<br /><br />I recommend that you read 11/22/63. Even though it has 849 pages it is enjoyable throughout and when you get to the end you will be more likely to be disappointed that is already over than glad you've finally finished it.
B00KDEVVDI|5|Wonderful application!
B00C25TCZ0|1|While I very much like Thin Lizzy and what Scott and company have been doing the past several years, this album disappointed me. I'm glad they changed name of Band, as to not taint the Thin Lizzy reputation.<br />The album is very patriotic toward Ireland, which is fine, but I was looking for a rock album from this crew, not Irish folk music.  While there obviously is a rock element, there was waaaaay to much bagpipe and folk music rooted themes for this album to be part of my regular rotation.  Actually, after listening through several times, I deleted this album from my collection.
B00DPM7TIG|5|This is one of those books you almost wish would never end. Not only did the author create unforgettable characters, he wove in complex moral questions, beauty, and insight into an era we too often relegate to cliche. A masterpiece.
B002CSC5EC|5|This is the first time I saw this film.  The content is excellent, with many great performances and interviews.  Most importantly the ambiance of the event comes through in a way you can not only see and hear, but feel it.  The Blu-ray features fantastic picture and sound, most especially for a 40-year-old material.  The extras on the second disk are very satisfying, with acts such as Leslie West and Mountain, that did not make it into the film, just because it did not promote the documentary's message, an otherwise great performance.  There are also revealing interviews with the filmmakers.  I enthusiastically recommend it!

B003UESJH4|4|I saw this movie in the theater and knew I would want a copy of my own. It arrived just as promised.  For those who love period pieces, historic pieces it is a must have. It explores the great friendship between two men and shows that royalty are when it comes down to it have much of their lives controlled by protocol.  The actors are well suited for their roles.

1400063515|5|This is a very important book for decision makers - it helps explain fallacies of common thought, and suggests ways to avoid these problems.  It's written in a style that highlights the achievements of doers over false philosophers and thinkers who encourage this mistaken style of thinking.  Fooled by Randomness teaches us the importants of understanding the impact of random events.  The Black Swan teaches us not to be fooled by attempts to measure them.    2 big core concepts drive the book:  - Where models (mental or computer based) are used, people too often resort to using \\"Bell Curve\\" based models, which dramatically underestimate the occurance of extreme events.  - Even if the right model is used, many events simply aren't able to be modelled.  The biggest extreme events aren't contained in the model's parameters or output.    There are several complaints levelled against the book:  - Practioners at least know about #1 - and in the financial markets they don't trust the bell curve.  The author would likely admit to this, and takes more issue with academics wedded to the bell curve.  - The author is too pompous and arrogant - It is hard to make a book about mathematical modelling interesting.  I suspect with a flatter tone, none of us would have even heard of the book.    - It's too long.  All in, it's much more than just a 1 idea concept book like \\"The Long Tail\\" or \\"Blink\\" - it explores the ideas further, and demonstrates them across many fields.      The book is easy reading, but not to be taken all in one sitting.  Mulling over a chapter or so a day will leave the reader understanding some powerful concepts.
B00BD99JMW|3|Not as good as the first two. The author has a difficult time changing perspectives. Disappointed in this book overall
B00BAXFECK|5|As I read The Goldfinch over the last few days, I was so immersed in Theo Decker's  life that when I ventured outside it was a shock to see Florida flatland when I was so sure the New York skyline should be there.  Scene after incredible scene  has bewitched me to the point where I cannot continue reading the last 50 pages because I do not want it to end.  Donna Tartt seems to create incredible middle-of-the-story visuals in her books and in this one it is life in a failed housing development in the middle of the desert, so reminiscent of a surreal painting where children and a dog are neglected while the adults occasionally show up in the teenage wasteland to dispense alcohol, drugs or abuse.  Although Tartt presents us with a down and dirty story it transcends our emotions, enabling us to nod our collective heads and bathe in the humor and love and bits of luck that weave themselves in and out of Theo's, and our own, lives.

B00005B36H|5|A friend asked me if Tool's new album was good or not the other day.  I told him that you can't really rate Tool as good or bad, that rather the band's music is like fine art.  You have to absorb it, think about it, make your own conclusions and ultimately decide for yourself.  Lateralus is just that.   A surreal, mind-boggling musical tapestry woven together by, IMHO, the best rock musicians alive today.  MJK uses rougher, deeper vocals in this album than he has in the past and the effect is fresh and exciting.  Also he breaks into some Chino Moreno style screaming at one point, a new direction for Tool.   The instrumental accompaniment is superb.  Adam Jones simply never ceases to amaze with his skill on guitar.  This album seems to flow: every few tracks, a slow, calm, evocative piece makes an appearance, followed usually by a more energetic, heavier piece.  The effect is amazing.   When you buy this album, go to a quiet place with your CD player.  Lay down comfortably, close your eyes and hit play.  Don't move until the end of track 13.  Let the music take your mind on a journey.  This is Tool.
B001UTW7QU|5|Truly I am enjoying this SciFi series!  I wish we had a 6th season for sure!  Love Amazon Prime Instant Video!
B00G5G7K7O|5|One of the best movies I've seen in recent years.  The music is outstanding.  I would highly recommend this movie for all ages.
B00005JM1F|5|Old School is about three guys whose lives are heading down the drain fast and the only way they can see to get out is to start their own fraternity.  Granted some of the members in the frat don't even go to the college, these guys are the talk of the campus.  They may be loved by the students but the dean of the college is an old acquaintance who would love to see this guys crash and burn.  In order to keep their brotherhood together the guys are forced to complete a series of tests to prove their merit as a legitimate fraternity.  Old School is so funny that you have to watch it more than once at a time.  If you have not see this movie then you are truly missing something that is almost spiritual.  A constant urge to watch this movie is there seeing that I have viewed it at least fifty times by now and constantly quote the characters.  Not only is this movie perfect for a party but anytime is a perfect time to put it in and enjoy.  Never have I met a person who doesn't love this movie and the people I meet who haven't seen it shock me terribly.  If you see one movie at all in your lifetime, the obvious answer should be Old School.
B008XG1X18|4|It's OK.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love the game but I wish you would develop more games compatible with kindle fire!
B00CH26TL8|4|I had never played this game and now, I find it addictive.  Fun and not so mind involved as some of the games I play.  I will visit it often in the future.  I have it loaded on my mobile device to keep my busy when time allows.
B0006284JQ|5|All I've read regarding this album is \\"rockist\\" propaganda about how Britney is too young/too inexperienced/too \\"horrible\\" to have released a greatest hits album... <br /> <br />...look at the numbers, buddy, and read the track listing.  Any casual radio listener will recognize almost every track--a feat rarely accomplished by collections from other artists.  Brit is the only female artist in history to have every album (including this one?) debut at number one, as well as selling over 40 million albums.  In the one-hit wonder pop landscape, Britney is already a historical landmark. <br /> <br />As for the album itself, one could hardly ask for more.  As previously mentioned, we get every major song she's released (including, to my dismay, the \\"Outrageous\\" single--a horridly executed track Jive pushed down our throats to capture a demographic--while excluding the fantastically underrated \\"Born to Make You Happy\\" and the unimpressive ballads \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\" and \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\"). <br /> <br />Additionally, we receive 3 new tracks.  To follow the recent trend of 80s-covers-as-greatest-hits-album-singles (No Doubt, Korn), Britney offers her sexy romp \\"My Prerogative\\"--fun, but not worthy of eponymy.  Rounding out the album is \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun),\\" an outtake from \\"In the Zone\\" that was downloaded so many times (mistakenly, by fans seeking the greatest hits single) that it was added, and \\"Do Somethin',\\" a track produced by the makers of \\"Toxic\\" that is quickly becoming my fave Brit track EVER. <br /> <br />That's right, 14 TRACKS you know (and love!) plus 3 NEW ONES, 2 of which are good and ONE THAT'S AWESOME.  Again, quite a feat for a greatest hits album. <br /> <br />Then there's the matter of the remix CD...I already own 2 of the remixes, and \\"Breathe on Me\\" redux falls quite short of the brilliant original.  The \\"Megamix\\" is as cheesy and fun as you expect...but the \\"Outrageous\\" remix is unbelievably great--it joins the small pantheon of songs \\"better than the original.\\" <br /> <br />So in short, anyone who is not completely insecure about enjoying fantastic pop music will find this disc in their stereos for a while.  Buy it, import it, IPOD it, and buy the DVD.  VIVA LA BRITNEY!!!
B008ASLK8A|4|The first Guy Ritchie Sherlock movie was phenomenal.  This movie is great, but suffers slightly by comparison because it wasnt quite as good.<br />I like how they modified Sherlocks planning out anticipating fight scenes. Keeping the same cool concept from the first, but changeing it a bit to keep it fresh.  Mild spoiler alert his plans can get interupted, and there are others out there who can do the same thing.<br />Overall not quite as good as the first, but I highly reccomend this film.
1409120546|5|LOVED THIS BOOK!
B00425S1H8|5|I bought this to hook up a printer to my laptop, which has only USB ports.  I loaded the driver, but it did not work.  It kept asking for a missing file.  So I just went to \\"plugable.com\\" (it's on the end of the cable on a label) and downloaded the driver from there and it worked fine, except for the computer assigning it to COM7, which the printer could not recognize.  It took a little research on the net, but I found out how to change the COM port assignation from 7 to 1.  After that, it worked great.  I consider all that a minor glitch.
B00KZ6WRAA|5|👍🏻👍🏻
B00DHBOQMM|5|I loved it  you gotta love the way Connelly slowly grinds the nuts and bolts of the prosecution to a paste. If I ever need a lawyer I think I'll settle for the Linc

0060853972|2|I picked up this book on the suggestion of a friend.  Said it was a fun read and something that I would enjoy.  He was wrong.  I did manage to finally plow through the book but did not enjoy it at all.  Most of it was predictable, a lot of it was not funny (while it tried to be funny).  If you are going to spend your money on a book, there are hundreds of thousands of better reads than this.
B00IJJUIMY|5|Absorbing as always for this series
B000K3HTRY|5|Quirky, funny movie. A little slow at times but overall entertaining.
B00HBQWGXK|3|As with all the Jack Reacher books, (I've read them all) I enjoyed this story.  But I don't think it's one of Lee Child's best Reacher stories.  That is why I only give it 3 stars.  Nontheless, I look forward to his next Jack Reacher adventure.
B00KW274SM|3|Thought the show stretched belief in reality it kept your attention.  The acting was blan, but not demanding of the observer.  If you want to be entertained and not challenged to solve thje crime too much, watch it
B00Y6QF0PE|5|It was good to get his point of view on things. Is it worth it I say Yes to understand more of why he was the way he is.<br />I can't wait till next book!!<br />Thank you E.L. James!!
1449410243|3|The book started out great but lost alot of steam in the middle. It lost its humor and became boring.
B004SBQGHS|4|We LOVE Angry Birds! I just wish I didn't have to pay for it twice. Once on my iPhone & once on my Kindle!
B000FBJFSC|5|Took me to  a different place and time.  His life was unimaginable.  Both sad and yet very funny and fun at times.
B0063IH60K|5|The hints are wonderful.  I am improving and can win many of the Random deals.  It's an old standby, but I really enjoy it.
0743243153|1|I cannot find the courage to<BR>express my true feelings about<BR>this... uhm..... book.<br />Squiggles
B00ENTDDGW|4|Good and entertaining design to the game but I find a couple critiques. As you increase the difficulty setting, it seems to jump too drastically between medium and hard. I also find that you block part of the screen while trying to control the puck, and this becomes a major problem on higher difficulty levels.
0307887448|5|This book was recommended to me by a good friend and fellow gamer. Really fun read with lots of nods to classic sci-fi and fantasy works as well as lots of video game lore. Quick read and addicting book.
B00KY7PEAA|4|Love this game . But too expensive to play.
B009EHDU7U|4|Very well written, almost believable.
B00GRPD0J0|4|Works great on my Kindle Fire..
0140120416|5|This book is organized in a way to help you steadily learn how to speak russian. It goes into detail on the specifics such as when russian words change. (adjectives, gender, etc) After a few chapters, you will feel that you are starting to learn russian. While some russian language programs seem to leave out important concepts, this book covers the why and how so you know why sentences and words are organized a certain way in russian. After that, it is up to you to learn the vocabulary. But with the information taught in these lessons, you will know how to use the words as opposed to just memorizing them.
B000OXHRRC|5|Great movie with a good story and strong cast of characters.
B00F031X62|5|Great live performance of Jimi Hendrix. The sound is outstanding. A must have for any serious Jimi Hendrix fan and collector
B00BVYNSLC|5|Riveting!
B005MMZR72|4|This was a really good series. My only fault with it was that it only had one season, and the ending left way too many unanswered questions. I wish that there was at least one more episode to tie it all together.
B006OE7XM4|5|Smooth Jazz singer. The music stays with you.
0545259088|4|The story we fell in love with during Shiver and Linger has finally concluded.  Stiefvater keeps us guessing up to the last minute as to what's going to happen.  Will Sam and Grace get to stay together?  Will Cole let himself love?  What about Isabel and her bloodthirsty father?  Will Grace's parents ever get a grip?  What about Beck and Sam's twisted relationship and Olivia's newfound wolf-hood?  These are all questions addressed in Forever.  Notice I said 'addressed.'  I'm not saying if they all get answered or not.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater has such a unique writing style.  When I'm in the mood to read one of her books (which I of course was for Forever), I really enjoy it.  Her books are meant to be savored slowly.  The lyrical writing abounds, along with lots of poetry: found in Sam's chapters, of course.  Sam is the most well-read young man I have ever encountered.  I have to admit that all of the poetry Stiefvater includes in her books makes me feel like an uneducated country bumpkin.  I'm no fan of poetry, so I can't always perceive the depth Stiefvater tries to achieve with her poetry.  I do appreciate a well-read character, though, even one with a taste for poetry that I don't always understand.<br /><br />One thing that I really like about The Wolves of Mercy Falls series is the alternating points of view.  It keeps the story moving so quickly, and makes me want to keep reading long past the point I said I'd stop.  I just love a first-person narration!  Forever explores the depth of Sam and Grace's love, but even more, it explores the bond between parent and child.  I loved that!<br /><br />Forever loses stars for two reasons.  The first is that the ending felt rushed and the second I will not reveal because it would spoil the book.  Once I got over the red print (seriously, WHY?) I really enjoyed the book.  However, my complaints were too great for me to give Forever five stars.  Upon closing the cover, I felt simultaneously happy and sad.
B0054JZC6E|4|it is a good time passer that u can use for a long time with a great variety of games but they should remove the ads
B007SGM084|5|Very erotic and a great love story.  Couldn't put it down.  Read it 3 times.  I have never reread a book once, but these I had too.
B00IG2DOKM|4|I love this game! If you are wanting to download Township then you will not be dissatisfied. There are many things to do and buildings to build. At first though this game is very interesting and interactive, but by the end the gameplay is boring and takes forever to load. But overall this game is appropriate for kids and very fun!!
B00DR0PDNE|1|I bought this because I thought it would work in hotel rooms.  It does not.
B00BWBHIUG|3|Ordered additional pearl and though the money was taken, I never received my in-app order. Not sure how to go about fixing this issue.
B000001G5A|4|This performance of Mozart's legendary Requiem holds a special place among countless other Requiem recordings.<br />Karl Bohm's directing makes this piece very vibrant and alive - emotional and elaborate, as reflected in the rather slow tempos chosen throughout the movements. The solo performers and orchestra are all very involved and create a marvelous tapestry of music. When it's all put together, the Requiem radiates in the religious aura it deserves.<br />The recording (audio-wise) is very warm and detailed - the organ portions are particularly alive, which is something lacking in many recordings.<br />All in all, it's definitely a good buy for anyone interested in owning an excellent interpretation of Mozart's Requiem.
B0090SI3EI|5|One of the best action films I have ever seen
B005GFPZYK|5|It was an awesome book. We need to give our support to our troops for their service to this country and to their families. God Bless!!!
B007SGLZP8|5|This book had twists in it that made it interesting to the end.  It was slightly different from Grisham's previous books.
B001JNNDGA|1|I slept thru most of it, I felt as if I was back in the detention room with Mrs. Ferris and the whole gang of regulars  on an Early Saturday mornings ,Damn  I miss those naps, and nachos at 7-11
B00HDMMISA|5|This book was a Fun fast read! I like a book with a positive message/ ending. Would recommend to friends.
B00C7JG0KG|5|great
B000FC2O48|4|I had never read Philip K. Dick prior to picking up Ubik and primarily read it because it was one of the books on the Time 100 Best Novels list. Most of the other books on the list have been overwhelming disappointments but Ubik was a breath of fresh air. Although I certainly wouldn't agree that it is one of the best books of all time, I feel that the story was an exciting, unique story that kept me wanting more.     I am generally not a huge fan of Science Fiction, but in this case, I was able to gain an appreciation for it and may venture in this realm a bit more in the future. Ubik was a great, easy read and I'm fairly certain that just about anyone would enjoy it. Unlike a lot of SF, I wasn't confused with the plot or setting. Overall it was very enjoyable.
B000002C25|2|The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because this album has a very few decent songs but the rest.... AARGH!    Remember the song \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\" from the album of the same name?  Basically what we have here is that song over and over again, except without a catchy melody but with even more distortion, a zillion guitars and noise.  Oasis thinks if they create lots of noise then they will be legendary, but they are forgetting that they are in the category of popular music.  Not unpopular noise.    Please read the bad and fair reviews on this album before considering buying it because I think they say a lot more about the album then the good reviews posted by fans who think anything Oasis is good.  No way!  Definitely Maybe is an excellent album, Morning Glory is good, and then this?!  The songs all sound the same, most are way too long, and they have a lot of bad guitar distortion, repitition, but nothing precise and good.  Except for the single \\"Don't Go Away,\\" which is an excellent ballad, but you've heard that song already I'm sure.  Don't buy this album for that song.  The title track is decent too, but nearly everything else sucks!  I gave this album at least 6 spins and really should have started liking it by that point, but this album is beyond salvation.    I would hate to imagine what the later Oasis albums sound like, and given their lack of radio play on any later songs, I would imagine that they are even worse.  I've heard other fans say that Be Here Now is the \\"last great Oasis album.\\"  Well, if being cocky and producing songs that are way too long because you think you are legendary is greatness, then please spare me.
B00003CXXJ|5|If there were ever a movie to see and to own, Shrek was it. Okay, maybe it's not the only one, but it's definitely worth having. The movie has got to be one of the funniest, smartest satyres to be produced in the last 100 years. With Shrek, you get to take everything you thought you knew about fairy tales and see them from the other side. The movie puts fairy tale living in a new light and challenges the viewer to see things through childlike eyes. It's like being a kid all over again. One of the best things about this movie is that it's great for kids and adults. Kids will love the general story and the animation. Adults will love the underlying messages and humor as well as the animation. And, you've got to see the extras on DVD...Trust me.
B00C0W08XK|5|I enjoy a great game, which is a great challenge.  This game has different levels so you can continually improve your mind.  Good for all ages, which I like for my Grandchildren. Now just need to get my husband to do this game and keep his mind active.  Thanks Sandy
B000FC12Z0|5|I had never read an Agatha Christie and thought I should since she is iconic in the world of suspense novels.<br />This is a great read.  The story and characters are believable. There is great humor and a wonderful ending.<br />Highly reccomend this book. One of my favorites.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I wish for ways to earn crystals for free, but that's all i think could be improved with this app.
B00ID96H0W|5|Definitely one of the albums of the year for me. Very heavy and full of emotion, and topped off with excellent cover art.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Fun game
B000001ZS4|5|Whilst not being as great as Oxygene his debute album,Equinoxe~ Jean-Michel Jarre is leaps and bounds better then many of his later releases. Here Jarre is heavily into space synth and his use of the synth sounds of the time is astounding.. In fact I find myself thinking (just like when I listened to Oxygen) what sound is like coming from which keyboard. Is this coming from the Roland Juno, the Moog or other keyboard.  Equinoxe part 3 is a classic and is right up their with some of his best tracks ever. This is before he becomes too avantgarde for his own best and makes utter junk like Zoolook and tracks like the horrid London Kid. This is such a good album that it lacks modern equivelent and Jarre still has not found the creative touch that he so much had during the 70's. This a cd to be owned by all lovers of great music.
B00J2PEZAU|3|Sorry, but I am one that does not understand the fascination with the movie, especially all the Oscar nominations.  There was some very good acting, but there were other far better movies that were ignored by the Oscar nominations.  I found myself wondering how much longer they can drag this out - portions could have/should have been edited out to keep the story line moving along.  I am glad I stuck it out - the twists near the end of the movie made it worthwhile.
B00DR0PDNE|4|This is really great, why does Amazon sell it but does not provide instant video on it? It's OK to make money selling the competitors product and screw your own prime customers......
B00A3NQNUU|5|love the game
B0013FSL3E|1|What A Dud ! Save your money for now and Buy the Movie \\"UP\\" this fall!!  You'll watch UP more times than this WALL-E  bore.
B002UZ5CHO|5|Shared this video with an AP environmental science class while studying global food supply.  Very informative, eye opening, and scary to know the truth.
0545128285|5|I love all the harry potter books and this was a great addition to the novels.  I love the childrens stories for wizards and witches.  They were very imaginative and good
B0043X1FOK|5|Great purchase.  Thank you very much I recommend it.  It was from childhood.  Great memories.  I appreciate it very much.
B001XVD2Z0|5|Still holds up!!
B008Y7045C|4|An imaginative romantic fantasy set in 1959 finds Juliette Binoche, an expert chocolatier, drifting across Europe with her daughter Victoire Thivisol, then landing in a quiet French village where Binoche opens a chocolate shop during Lent, to the displeasure of the town's overly controlling and intrusive mayor, who gins up the Catholic town-folk to ostracize Binoche and her chocolat shop. But Binoche's chocolat comes from a 2000 year old Mayan recipe with magical powers that liberate people (and animals) to pursue their heart's desires.  Judi Dench, is Binoche's diabetic Landlord, Lena Olin, an eye-catching but mis-cast troubled new friend who is transformed by the chocolat, and Johnny Depp drops by as a river gypsy and love interest of Binoche who appears disaffected by the chocolat because he is actually living his heart's desire. Take the Sound of Music and replace the music with chocolat, then place the set in  1959 France ... the town is alive with the magic of chocolat. Quaint, cute, and whimsical.
B009NQZVKG|5|Exciting. I love the fact and fiction that is mixed together in these books. Let me move outside myself and see another world.
B00AIUUXHC|4|The Grandkids loved it
B000FC130E|5|Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman 5 stars★ and a favorite♥ (kindle 5★♥/ dramatized audio on itunes own5★♥♥)<br /><br />Wow. Neil has been recommended and liked by a lot of shelfari people here. And so I just got 'round to reading Neverwhere and really enjoyed it. His writing is very gripping and the storyline is quite new and different. I really enjoyed reading Neverwhere.<br /><br />And then I've listened to the dramatized audio and liked that as well. Even though it was a just a little short. I loved James McAvoy. He was funny.<br /><br />I will definitely be giving his other books and audiobooks a go. (Probably Stardust because I absolutely loved the movie).<br /><br />Quotes I liked:<br /><br />&#34;London grew into something huge and contradictory. It was a good place, and a fine city, but there is a price to be paid for all good places, and a price that all good places have to pay.&#34;<br /><br />“Do you like cat?” she said.<br />“Yes,” said Richard. “I quite like cats.”<br />Anaesthesia looked relieved. “Thigh?” she asked. “Or breast?”
B00IYOACQ6|3|I liked Can You Escape and Can You Escape 2 a lot better.  I find Tower to be a little too difficult in some of the levels.  For example, I've had to look up the walkthroughs on a few, and even still I would end up thinking, &amp;#34;I would have never figured that out!&amp;#34;  In the first two games, even if I got stuck, I usually knew I had to figure out what to do with a certain object or picture, but in Tower I'll just get completely stuck with no idea what to do.  Also, it seems like there's a lot more &amp;#34;randomness&amp;#34;.  What I mean by that is a lot of the solutions seem to be just a ton of trial and error, rather than having a connection with something else in the room.
B0091LS07E|5|My girl did it again. I am Alicia Keys fan from her first album. My girl is happy in her life and she conveys this throughout the entire album. I love every track, can listen to the album from 1st to last song and not want to skip (Which is a rarity). My favorites are tracks 1 thru 7, track 9 and 12, not excluding the other tracks, I can just identify with those especially. This albums flow is mellowly, R&B, jazzy, sultry and of course sprinkled with hip-hop. This album has made my day:)
B007J4T2G8|3|It is not what I would normally go for when picking a book. But I had to jump on the band wagon and see what it was all about. The story was very thin, it's mostly them two having sex like 10x a day. As far as the authors ability to keep the story fresh >FAIL< she is the most repetitive writer ever, how many times is Ana gonna blush, flush, and bite her lip? Many times you feel your reading the same thing over and over again.  Okay that being said, it's hard to put down. It is a very easy and fast read. And although not a great piece of literature, It was a very interesting and fun read.
B000005JA8|1|She's tryin' to make a monkey out of you.
B00APJLFEG|5|Very well thought out. Good messages for everyone in an enjoyable way. Thorougly, enjoyed by all of our family. Thanks.
B00BAYLQI0|5|This is a beautiful, inspiring movie from a tragedy of colossal proportions. It's impossible not to cry almost continually: tears of heartbreak and tears of relief.
B000OVLINI|4|A good book with a unique plot and a worthy read.
B008UCJ7KO|4|Before I even read the book I read some of the reviews and I  was scared to read the book. So I read it anyways. I thought overall the book was awesome. I think both Eva and Gideon learned about each other and grew as a couple. They still got a lot to deal and learn to do. The only thing that killed the entire book was the plain ending. I wished she would of left some thrill to the story to keep me anxious and waiting for the next book
B001GM28HO|5|This CD is very good. I have been playing it over and over. The songs make you want to get up and dance
B00594XOZU|5|Kik is amazing! I recommend it to all the ppl that r reading this! It is the worlds fastest texting app! It tells u when it was delivered, dent, and read!!!!
