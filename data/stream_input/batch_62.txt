B004I5TPF4|5|love it  this is my 4th pear the last one lasted.. my first 3 where hit and runs..
B0058EBVXS|5|Excellent
B00MAG6RMM|5|Nice and bright. Perfect fit.
B004BR6V42|4|For the price it was what I expected. One of them is now on my car.
B000GTWWD8|5|Item just as described, works well even with my old half that hasn't broken yet after many years.<br />I'm happy with this purchase.
B000H6QWWC|5|Trailered my new indian down there and the straps worked well. I did have to buy soft straps so if you purchase a set of these make sure you pick up a set of soft straps.
B00H91RZVA|5|Replacing the original 13 year old brake lines, hopefully they outlast the truck this time.
B00OPXADOG|5|Very cool decal. It's textured not flat which is really cool and better than photo I think.
B00BLX1L4O|3|It's alright. Not a perfect steering wheel emblem but it works as long as yours doesn't start showing the peeling like mine did. Prior to that, with careful handling and placement it looks nice. I ended up purchasing another one because the first showed signs of a clear film peeling away. I'm not sure if that was there before but it's definitely bad looking now. For what it's doing I think it should be half the cost. Hopefully the new one works out better.
B001S81EQM|3|WILL THIS FIT MY CTS 2004?
B00JV59RDG|2|Not matching the picture
B00GJKA7WQ|5|Great match and great price!  I'm glad I read where someone said the easiest thing to do for installation is just pop off the cover and attach it to the metal piece on the door; of course, this assumes that you still have the metal piece still intact.  As an added measure, I added some super glue to ensure it doesn't pop off again...
B00LI8R31C|5|Exactly what it says it is.
B008M22I0I|5|Great fit and quality!!!
B00AF6QIZK|5|These saved my engine in a crash. Lowsided at the track - walked away needing to replace the carbon cover on my exhaust and frame/engine sliders. A must have!
B004TRKBOK|5|Love it.  I keep it in my glove compartment for emergencies.<br />Luckily, I have not had to use it.
B00SYX1BWG|5|You get exactly what you see, no surprises. It is made of wood although it kind of looks like metal in some pictures.
B00K889FCI|5|Works pretty well!<br />There's enough solution for many headlights. It does take a little scrubbing but it sure works well for the price. Would be good stuff for detailers or car dealerships.
B00IO4EYMY|5|This is pure R134a without &#34;stop leak&#34; additive.
B00LCHBEUA|5|Great look on my Wild1 572 bars and with black Ness mirrors - --1996 Road King
B000EFAOD4|4|Overall I am happy with these towels, but for 2 issues.  The first is the tag they put on them.  Perhaps there is a legal requirement for the tag, I don't know, but I hate the stupid tag.  Even if you cut it off , it still creates a non-microfiber surface that comes in contact with my vehicle and if your not careful, it will scratch your clear coat.  Second issue is when I am using them to apply Mothers liquid wax, I can't fold them up in a way that doesn't frustrate the hell out of me.  They are either too small or need to be reshaped for ease of use.  There is always a piece dangling off that creates a spot that I have to go back over when applying the wax.  I gave it 4 stars cause for the price I don't know that any other brand offers anything different or better.
B00I7EXYRW|5|Best price and fits perfect
B000VL1TIA|5|These grommets work great as I add a grommet to my flag to fly it horizontally.  I've been doing this for 5+ years with no failures.
B002P2ZNJE|5|Worked as expected. Great product.
B007Y86AIM|5|Good quality, my car runs better now with this alternator. It fit perfect.
B0000AZ8JB|3|The suction cups doesn't hold well. Falls off every 2 - 3 hours in the water.
B002XG8V6O|4|did the job!  Fair proce
B0007O8S58|5|Product is just as described and fast shipping also thanks
B00BTKY2Z4|1|The fitment was horrible.<br />The chrome was flaking off in spots.<br />Overall it was crap. I will never purchase anything from them in the future
B0042ER134|5|Great fit and price ,would buy from again
B005S09XUA|5|Looks great and fits perfect!
B00PGYFVEU|5|Perfect for completing my home care paperwork!!!
B000EVWDAK|5|Great code reader for your money. Does everything it said it will do.
B008B5U5U6|5|No problems with oil.
B000YEPTKS|1|Needed a full rebuild. Stopped working in 2 days. Now it runs great after another $200
B00E3VVENE|4|Wish the center had some type of expanded mesh to protect the grill better. Instructions were kind of hard to follow, and I am an auto tech by trade, so I did figure it out. All and all, it fits very well, and I would recommend it to other Chevy/GMC owners. i will get an expanded mess and get it powdered coated and steel rivet it to the up rights of the main support. Then it will be animal/bird proof. Well worth the investment. Darn good product for the cost.
B003PB41SI|4|Does what it suppose to do.
B00AK0WLNE|5|Very Good Product
B0041WOEYG|5|The blower went out on our 2007 Honda Civic and it was going to cost a few hundred dollars to diagnose and fix the problem at a local mechanic shop.  This part is one of the easiest to change on the civic.  There is a piece that drops down under the glove compartment section and a few screws hold this in.  You simply unplug the connector, unscrew the old one and then reverse the steps to install the new.  The car was not blowing any air before swapping this out and as soon as I turned the key I knew it was fixed.  It's been going strong ever since.  You can save a lot of money by purchasing this and throwing it in yourself.
B00LIDY5HW|5|Looks great will give it 5 stars.  Will be back later with another update if they don't hold up.  So if you don't see an update from me then it was a good to purchase.
B0006UHR14|4|Not bad!
B00877SL2M|4|Very cheap price
B00853A608|5|Perfect fit good material and the GM in the middle looks good
B000WO3358|5|Comfortable and went on easy. Little bit of dish soap they slid right on. After soap dried they stay put and feEl great on the hands. Very little vibration felt from my Katana 600
B00AVQSFY6|4|fits perfectly
B000M8RYMC|5|Bought a gallon to use in my MGB.  Although the trans specifies 20w-50 motor oil...I wanted to use a gear oil instead.  I did the diff first, which requires it, then used the rest in the trans. Hard to find in the local big name(or small name) parts stores any longer.  Most everything is GL5 which will damage older gearboxes with bronze bushings.
B00IIOEUCO|5|Never disappoints
B000KKJRS6|5|Super heavy duty reciever. All solid steel.
B00OVB5EIW|5|Seems to shrink just by a few mm after use and exposing to heat but still fits really really good - so happy to have it, saves my dash from the scorching rays of the sun!
B0008MGIHE|5|Ordered these a while ago but JUST but them on and they look even better than I expected.  Definitely a vibrant fire truck sort of red, not a maroon color like I was worried it would be from the picture.
B004ME8MZ0|5|Very nice
B00EBQJA78|3|Cheaply made
B00150T13G|5|Smelled great! not sure how long it lasted but probably a month. Slim design easy to conceal
B00N08W5HU|5|Works perfectly on my Harley Dyna Wide Glide, no leaks and gives a clean flush appearance for the gas cap.
B00EUZRZ68|5|Bought this for my wife to use at PHA hillclimb events, she had borrowed one of the cheaper gforce or similar balaclavas and complained about the thickness, and specifically that there was a seam right in the front of her forehead that drove her nuts. So we sprung for this one, and she's glad we did, much thinner and lighter than the cheap ones, and no annoying seam, the material is almost like a silky spandex rather than the thick nomex. Would be nice if amazon had one with a full face opening since she runs a closed face helmet anyway (and doesn't have a moustache to catch fire) but that was pretty clear from the picture beforehand.
B000NNON7U|5|Very nice! Well made and fast shipping. I purchased the sport bike cover. It fits my Ducati 696 perfectly! It covers front and back tire hanging just above the ground.Highly recommended.
B0017KHTS8|5|Perfect
B00AU7YB1C|5|Installed it as interior lights replacing OEM bulbs on my 2003 Lexus LS430. I have not had any issues yet with any of the bulbs installed so far. It works like a charm.
B00BTHQFMU|4|Nice product, quick shipping
B001DAIJ86|5|Great product and price. Perfect fit on 1995 jeep grand cherokee...
B00651CIGM|5|(Review on Looks/Fit/Finish only.)<br />2015 Jeep Wrangler<br /><br />I am very happy with this purchase.  I don't use AM/FM radio, and my stock antenna was getting mangled in the car-wash. Although i can't comment on the reception qualities of the antenna, the looks are excellent.  The 14&#34; model is the perfect height.
B00JNT7QG0|5|Well made, fits perfectly, easy to use. They should give one of these to you when you buy a Subaru Crosstrek because it's as important as the floor mats and it's tailor-made for the car.
B00480J4I2|3|They work. No complaints
B00QGJGP5I|1|its already broken after I used it to hang up my suit!!
B0022ZXOE0|3|Took a small bag on the back of my bike on a 2 hour trip fine,  added one set of clothes on way home and one of the clips snapped cut me open on its way up.
B000CBUJL2|4|great
B00480FIEG|4|Good so far with a good price.
B003UI3I44|5|Good
B002QAC66I|5|great cord keeps the cord out of the way with the angled head
B00AVQSFY6|5|fair
B003X7PV06|1|Garbage
B0040DX7EO|5|love broadway mirrors. easy to use and stick on the rear view mirror. was not broken or defective.
B0078HTEL4|4|it fit perfect. I had no issues with it.
B00NLMEMYO|4|I was very happy with the car cover and the entire process. It arrived a day or two early, and was just as described.
B00W6J1J5S|5|Great got them faster than I thought
B00AO6II40|5|I bought one too large but it's a great helmet. I wear a cap underneath and it works great
B00SJOPOOQ|4|Exactly when they said that would get here and same size as pic said good job
B00DBEOQLG|5|Work good quick shipping
B00MU5X17M|5|As described and recieved quickly.
B00ADPVJS4|5|Good product and super fast shipping .
B009AGY7IQ|5|Car license plate frame is hefty. The text I chose was put on in a professional manner. clear and precise. Will order another one.
B002ZBWKAU|5|Worked verry well to bring a pair of mounted and loaded trailer tires up from about 10 lbs psi to the recommended 50 lbs PSI. Easy to follow directions and to operate. Leave car ignition on Acc mode the whole time. DId not need to start engine to get or keep the inflator running. However, a single 7-minute run on the first tire brought the pressure up only to about 43 lbs, so I gave the inflator a 20 minute rest before finishing and moving on to the other tire. Gave it a rest after 7 minutes on the second tire too. So it did takea little longer than advertised, but it was not that loud, the vibration was not severe, and the inflator did not heat up. I was happy with it. It sure beats pumping up a trailer or motor vehicle tire by hand, and the digital display is clear. I also bought a separate digital pressure gauge to cross-check. That was helpful too.
B004K2F55E|5|Excellent
B00CCSD5U0|4|This was a small roll. I was only able to do the head lights of my tundra. It was hard to stretch when hot too and left a few wrinkles on my lights but I think that was my bad. Overall the look is good though.
B00E9GVIGG|5|I have the Summerland 1700FQ Trailer. The Box size is 18' x 7' x 10.6'. This cover fit a little snug but not too tight. Will purchase the next size larger when it's time to replace it. I like this Company and their RV Covers.
B00QMVKIEO|5|Easy to install and it came super fast!
B00265M9SS|5|This was a little more expensive than the one at Harbor Freight. But the quality is far superior. I had to replace a master cylinder on my car and this kit paid for itself with the amount of time it saved  me to fully bleed the system.  It also is a one man job with this kit. I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.
B000E0ZB5U|5|Did the trick for my 97 Dodge Ram
B00ODQ6LEQ|5|Love them
B007V2CS1O|5|Sturdy, works pretty well. Just a pain to store sometimes if the carpool is packed.
B000MIT5VA|3|Could use some better speakers but still nice
B0051TPJKG|3|I'm presuming it's OK. Fortunately I haven't had to use it.
B000CMD9Z4|5|Excelent product
B00KO5P94I|5|Everything Washington correct no complaints
B00X1V34DU|5|These work better than the really fancy (multi connect with allen screws to tighten in the wires etc)  ones I had bought previously.<br /><br />Just solder some nice connectors on the ends of your wires and you are good.
B009T3AF7W|5|Works like a charm- after u fix what previous owner hodge podged
B0055NW05A|1|they don't have adhesive on back , didn't tell you that
B00UAEQX4I|1|Not universal because size matters!
B0075HHNDS|5|love it
B001Q399RA|4|Would have give it a 5 but the connection where u plug in the control works loose.no big deal just tighten it up.
B001R6CZ22|2|Low quality, all of these, the plastic housing separates too easily, so unless your bike sits as a showpiece in your living room, you'll be replacing them in short order.
B00X4EC9G2|5|As described
B009TAAATI|5|this one i thought initially after seeing the price difference between OEM weatherTech and this one.<br />but frankly this one is also more durable and comftable plus looks are brillient.<br /><br />advantage is they dont have hooks whihc weathertech has which give hard time to someone who dont want to see it.<br /><br />i will definately recommend this 5 starts.
B005KVLX50|5|Works great for kayaks
B008T4YOSS|5|Yes it was just what I expected. I like it and delivery  was fast.
B00CBTRMZ4|1|I replaced two Optima blue tops in my boat.  Based on reviews I thought this would be a good in board solution.  I installed it, and went to check on how it was charging / maintaining the charge, and discovered that it was charging at 16.7 VOLTS!!!!!  Hopefully it did not totally fry my brand new optima battery.  Sent it back to Amazon.  and order the Optima brand charger.
B005SAJ0F8|5|Love it! It makes my car look so elegant while I'm witnessing for Christ!
B00WZX9UN8|5|Beautiful! Great price. Made our car look new again.
B000BNXRVK|5|Worked perfect just as advertised.
B0039044RI|5|Everything I needed is here. And the boat is back up and running. So I'm happy.
B007J8IKFI|5|Works great!
B00US55NK4|5|They brack a lot
B006ADFMHM|5|On my last deployment I was a door gunner on a CH-47 and fell in love with the airframe. I bought this decal because of its detail vs the solid silloete types. It looks as good in person as in the picture. The detail does make it a little harder to put on, but just take your time and go slow. I used a plastic putty knife to apply pressure to the decal as I was pulling up the hazy cover film, it worked great with no bubbles or tears. I only wish other colors were available. Great decal none the less! Quick shipping too.
B01093PU2K|5|Love, love, love, this gelepad, I use it at my desk and it takes all the pressure off my tennis elbow. I move it when I move my laptop, super easy to move.
B002OUMVWY|4|We have been RV'ng in a park for about a year while we build a house and have had these connected continuously to allow our grey tanks to remain open.  The hose rigidity is very good for defining and retaining a path - and stays in the track during windstorms, etc.  One big complaint is that after a year of intermittent sun exposure the plastic has rotted, and the hose splits if it is bumped now.  Will order another, but wish it were made to last.
B00JAMYDFC|3|Works pretty well, but not great. I used it to clean dirt of my vinyl boat seats. Didn't get it all...even after letting it sit and a second application.
B00K8E0WAG|5|I bought this battery to use in the back of an Old Town Vapor 10 Angler kayak. It fits nicely between the two rod holders behind the seat. I keep it in a small plastic box to keep it up out of any water that may get in the kayak.<br /><br />Using this battery to power a 30lb thrust Minnkota trolling motor on the kayak. I haven't drained it dead. With no battery meter, I can't say how far I've drained it. I can say that cruising around at all different speeds for 5 hours while fishing, the battery was still going strong.<br /><br />Great space/weight saving battery for kayaks, or small watercraft.
B000C2EGXI|5|Awesome quality.  Fit perfectly.  Love that it comes with everything, including the little spacers, which fall apart on these engines.
B009B9HBNA|5|Perfect fit love it.
B00H9KHA4S|4|I love this sunshade. It works great in blocking the hot desert sun. Its really bulky though and hard to store. Still very happy I bought it.
B00XZ9MXQM|5|Great just like I needed
B007P4V8KU|5|Great replacements for worn struts. Far less costs than local stores, seem to be well made. Fit like originals
B007H2Q01M|1|Very uncomfortable going back to Cabelas to replace these
B004SPT5GS|5|Perfect fit
B000EDQR78|4|Installed in my kitchen.  It is a handy item . Works easily for grasping filters.
B000ILLJWY|5|I am happy with fit and looks of visor
B0002NYDZ8|5|As a golf course equipment tech I do a lot of greasing. These guns are the best I've used, easy to prime and heavy duty.
B00OX2GLAY|5|It's true, and it's a good sticker..pretty sticky!
B008YFTX6U|5|Arrived on time is expected time great buy I purchased 880 fog lights on my gtp brighter than my headlights for now till I buy the halo headlights for it along with sdx hid for it
B00DWVN08I|5|This part fit perfectly into my hitch receiver but I think it was a little pricey for what you get...just molded rubber. I blame Toyota for not including this part with my new 4-Runner.
B008HNLHFE|5|great charger
B009SUJU1S|5|Fits really nicely and very comfortable
B004QBZM3Y|5|good.
B005G3XFW6|3|The &#34;United States Zombie Hunting Permit&#34; is a really neat decal, but not very strong. I had ordered another sticker of the same type and the ink started to run as I applied it to the surface of a car.  I recommend the decal for indoor use on lockers, computers, folders or plastic travel cases (such as for a laptop) but not necessarily for outdoor use.
B005TOLSBC|1|Very disappointed.  I very carefully installed the board and battery from the old unit; everything snapped together without issue.  A few days later however, I noticed a hairline fracture on the back of the case.  Very inexpensive but I'd like for what I buy to last.  It's unfortunate but not the end of the world obviously.  I asked for a replacement, I was told one would be shipping within 3 weeks.  That was nearly 6 weeks ago.  A follow up request went unanswered.
B00317C0AW|5|Fast delivery,and the right parts the first time,And name Brand parts......👍
B00C7M33BM|5|Purchased these for my mk1 scirocco. Fit was perfect with my Bilsteins and they ride and handle like a dream. Just what I imagined. Zero bounce and not too stiff or soft. A huge improvement over the stock suspension. Thanks again!
B00H86T4AQ|5|Direct fit, easy to install. Took about 10minutes.
B000CEZRHU|5|It's going on two years now without a problem
B0002JMF9I|5|is good
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Handy'er than a shirt pocket good product
B0019I87PC|2|It fits but....came with only one nut. Had to make a trip to the hardware and spend a few more dollars to buy another nut.
B007PPG0Q6|5|very good
B0093XLGVM|2|They aren't that bright.
B002G5DLMQ|5|quality sticker
B00MNRO52W|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DECAL! It shipped quick, came in proper conditon. I have it on my jeep, it has held up well to the tree branches and copious amounts of mud from wheeling. I get tons of compliments on the decal.
B00JAXXD2U|5|Fit 2009 Electra Glide CVO perfectly. Using for about 2 months now.  Very quick starting battery.  Top and side mounting locations on positive and negative terminals make it very easy to cleanly attach main battery cables and  accessory leads.
B00WYO2R6K|5|love it! gave away as gift, person likes it very much. Bought  one  for  myself.
B00EKEGRVS|1|Fell apart right away.
B001A0F88I|5|good product
B008FQ6VCC|5|Awesome! Was delivered at a prompt time no damage to the box
B00JK322MW|5|I like these jumper cables a lot. They came in a cute little zipped bag. I like the length of them. I didn't have a hard time using them. This was my very first time using jumper cable's.
B009FUF6DM|5|a must if you want a clean machine
B00E448WJY|5|very good and fast service would order again
B006D9W2I0|5|one word.... BEEF CAKE<br /><br />thats all you need to know... Easy to install, you do need to drill one hole but it is worth it, I also recommend rat filing all the mounting holes, this provides a nice solid ground! will use again on future jeeps!
B003BIVWCS|5|Great
B0002HRBSU|5|works great!
B0049MVC66|4|Reasonable easy to install. The bolt holes lined up ok, but not perfect. Had to do some flexing to get it to bolt on.
B000ALJSIY|1|good idea, did not work. did not hold the toll pass.  The JL Safety EZP300 Indestructible Holder EZ Pass-Port Unbreakable Toll Pass Holder for NEW and OLD E-Z (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009Y7MJVS?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_34) worked better
B0113777YA|5|This is the same kit like the other but cheaper in price but not in quality.  It was a good choice.
B000C2EE5I|2|Turned out on 2009 and above subaru forester no gasket is needed. Silicone sealant only. Using a gasket such as this cost me more time and money as it cause oil pan to leak. Too much of a gap. Check when your subaru pan is done the original has no gasket then do not use a gasket. Sealant only
B00B5L9P04|5|Item as described.
B00K35RC8U|5|Works great
B00DGMA9K0|3|Doesn't fit 2007 Mazda 3 Hatchback
B00J1C4XI8|2|I did not like the product because it did not come with the cargo liner as advertised.
B003QHDLEQ|5|Works great!
B004ZC3TFC|5|Just plugged it in and everything seems to work great.
B000BUU5YU|5|will be good in an emergency
B001AV9BTO|5|A lot of paper for the money.  i will buy again.
B00BD4SK0Y|3|It's fine. Looks great and covers all seat.
B00IXZU2WU|5|Worked great.
B008NB7WYK|4|The magnet decal was very detailed, well done, looked great on my car... however, the magnet was not strong enough to keep a punk from stealing it in the parking lot..oh well
B001JT3AWQ|4|Due to an un-expected and an unforeseen  $7500.00 adventure with a well know shop in MO  I've not been able to test this product yet. It's riding well in the side box though. The plastic that thing is wrapped in works great. LOL 😎
B000G72UOQ|4|Works in our new Ford Transit van - much better than the shades sold at the dealer.
B013L802XW|5|Great headlights worth the money....put them on my 69 z28 camaro. ....
B00Z709KKY|4|Here's why reviewers say that the mirrors are scratched: the packaging doesn't tell you to peel off the protective film from the surface! Duh! Once you do, the mirrors are excellent.
B00HBAG9AC|3|I've had some ups and downs with this device.  On the face, it is an excellent idea and I've had it work a couple times.  Data, properly situated in an understanding of the accuracy, is always a great thing.<br /><br />However there are a some silly design choices which make the device a pain to use.<br /><br />1. The instructions on the case are INCOMPLETE and missing vital steps.  You must wait for the device to warm up and display a 1-10 blinking ready code.  If you get a 7-8-9 code, it won't work, and if you get a blinking 10 code, the battery is dead (note, I cannot find out what the 7-8-9 code means, online or in the included manual)<br /><br />2. The reader is needlessly small (which is convenient to stash in the glovebox) but it takes 6V to do a reading, meaning they squeeze two ridiculously small (and thus low capacity) CR2016 batteries in the back.  If they had made it only slightly larger (like the size of a deck of playing cards, it is currently about the size of 4 credit cards stacked) they could have designed this to use 4xAAA batteries.  Since I get EXACTLY ONE reading/warmup cycle out of brand new Sony CR2016 batteries, the sensor clearly draws a fair amount of current.  And a battery the size of a dime cannot hold many mAh.<br /><br />3. So, final point, this device needs to exist.  It really should be a sensor built into all new cars, given environmental, efficiency, CAFE, etc. concerns which are so popular right now.  But, if you buy one, either invest in a stack of CR2016 and be prepared to change them before EVERY READING or buy yourself a 4xAA or 4xAAA holder and solder it in.  I tried option 1, and it annoys me.  Going for Option 2 now, will update with pictures and results.
B00P4XTCK2|5|Exactly what I needed.
B002TTU96A|5|Great quality
B00144BAGY|5|Fantastic product
B000E347M0|3|I've installed several of these, only one has failed.  Not very high quality, but they did solve the rubber motor mount bushing issue.
B00YRYN0KW|1|Not bright
B00INCAJ8A|5|So far so good , shipping was fast my product was estimated to arrive between 24th and 31st but I got it on the 18th. I have install my new rotors and breaks next day so far they work perfect I'm happy with this product,
B001IWLBXY|5|Just like OEM for my 07 BMW E90 335xi.
B0072X8RNU|5|No issues and no problems with the product!
B00K116BYM|5|Worked like a charm and delivered fast!  Would buy again.
B000C2WM34|5|Nice OE quality Koyo bearing and I have never had a Gates belt fail even with some going over 125K miles.
B0097CDL76|5|Works fine!
B00HMTHW1M|2|The decal only lasted a few weeks. I wash the vehicle it was on an it peeled off
B00DD0GV02|5|Very happy with this product. Will be buying some for the front very soon.
B00MLKY9AO|5|Already crashed while dirt biking, face first into the side of a hill. The helmet help up great and protected me well.
B007BL4WPA|5|This fit his 2003 Dodge Ram truck, and we had it installed right away.  Saved us money over the dealer's cost.
B0009IK5T4|5|Worked great
B002X1NLOQ|4|Fast delivery.  Took a while to install, but it was a good fit.
B00IESMAOO|5|I wasn't even looking for this on Amazon and when I saw it, it was love at first sight. I had to have it and now that it's here I'm so happy. It fits perfect with my car.
B00GZ059RI|5|Making my friends jealous, great product.
B000WG3JU0|5|I love this!  Perfect fit as advertised.
B007G1U1FK|5|looks good on the back of my car
B000BJEYSY|5|great stuff works great in the motorhome
B00DL1GB58|4|Nothing special, just a factory part, but this with the gears make for a great replacement for the original heater control knob cable that bends and doesn't move when you turn the knob. Good price and shipped quickly. Was a good diy project for an easy to do fix for a common Evo 8 problem.
B003VFNZEY|2|ordered the set of three but got two yellow and one clear instead of one of the gray
B00CDFUYMO|5|LOVE  them, comfy n light
B009WQ3JFQ|5|Great quality and fit - far better than weather tech to me
B00MLKCGHC|5|Perfect fit, very good helmet for the price.
B000GPV2QA|2|Didn't do what it was advertised to do. Very disappointed.
B001UG6OUI|5|Still have this sticker at least a year later and no sign of failure and I got it exactly as described!
B004L036Q0|5|Attached them to to the boat and can now see at night
B00099HVN6|5|awesome but, don't let them get banged up, jostled around or otherwise shock-impacted...they don't nearly as long if you do that.  Just strap it down really well in your engine compartment and it will keep you happy for a long time...
B001KNYOPI|5|Good Quality stuff
B0007M1ZGE|5|A+
B00TY78AQ6|1|It was difficult to get on and when I finally did I noticed it had a rip in it.
B00DI7XNBK|5|Its a biker bell. It's a cute one if you like Rottweilers. It arrived on time and made the recipient ( they have to be a gift) very happy.
B000C59V76|5|Same as local auto parts store but at a good savings on the price. If you have prime and can afford a day or two this is the best way to go.
B00U04S4DG|5|Came faster than expected! Great product, fit good.
B0046I3I8I|1|These covers are not as advertised. This item has no real value. The photo  is not the item you will actually receive. It looks bright white and shinny. It is actually light brown and flat colored. The item is prone to tear. It is not durable and does not does not protect tires and wheels from sun damage, rust and dirt as it is some what transparent. The canvas is thin as a disposable paper towel. I have never written a review before but this item has no real value. Leo
B008DZYANM|5|Just awesome !
B00N22UK58|5|Works just fine but used my old straps.
B00KTIQAZW|5|I ordered two of these replacement keyless buttons to replace the two original ones, both of which no longer worked. The dealer wanted $135 per device, and suggested I check out Amazon.  I was able to get 2 such devices for a total of $26.  I then had them programmed by my dealer, at a cost of $25. I am happy to say that both devices work perfectly and exactly like the original ones that came with the car.  I am very pleased with the result.  And, these replacement key buttons look exactly like the original ones.
B00X41XF2C|5|Nice
B006R34PB4|5|Very bright but not blinding. Gave my car a very nice modern look
B00HTP8N0I|5|Bright so they can be soon very good. Held bike GREAT thru everything.
B0012RI7DM|5|It was easy to install, just follow the instructions, which are included, they walked me through the installation, with no problems.
B000FP1QT4|4|We use it for a timer for our cool suit cooler for auto racing.  It works as described. I could not be happier.  It also takes a cycle for it to change to the new setting.
B00YI3IGA6|5|This provides the best coverage out of any window shades I've seen. It fits our Prius great and it stays put.
B001O7PNS2|5|it works
B00RW4LQFK|5|Super simple to put on, we had it on and  secured in 10-15 minutes.
B003BZINKU|5|Fit great and worked
B000C0YA9U|5|excellent
B00IUWLZMW|5|Super battery, I loved the digital diagnostics/voltmeter that were included as an integral element of the battery.
B000EGHVT8|5|We love these.  They work great under the camper jacks and are easy to carry with no worry of bugs like you would with wooden blocks.  We had lots of people ask about them while camping.
B0023WGRCI|5|Easy to install and works great.
B0022ZQPCS|4|It works well on the special Inked Helmet just wish we could find a cleaar or a smoked.
B000Q6SL2W|5|Good quality product.  Works very well.
B00FFGTY74|5|Love them
B000E3220Y|5|I thank the seller all ok
B00QG8Z5A0|5|Amazing quality and great fit. Very comfortable. I originally bought the Alpinestars GP Pro gloves but returned them immediately after receiving these Scorpions.
B00M5D8D54|5|Works great and a 3rd of the price the jd dealer wanted
B002WH7AY8|5|Replaced a faulty motor on a 2002 CRV.  Not a difficult job, there are Youtube videos to help with the process.  Everything fit perfectly, used the bolts from the old factory motor to attach the new one.  Doing this job yourself can save you $150-$250 or more.  The motor may or may not be as good as an OEM motor, but at 1/5 the cost, it's worth taking a chance.
B00N99OAWI|4|Good price for a pair of keys with the internal electronics.  Easy to program, seller provides a link for your application.  (RKE is remote keyless entry)
B00444YM5C|5|Nice --- go Union jack
B001Y935CG|5|Awesome product. Great fit!
B000SBCHCA|5|I bought this to have the flexibility to reach under the hood and make connection and disconnect easier.  Great addition.
B008EEZ90U|4|I am definitely an Aisin fan.  They are the OE part on most Japanese vehicles.  My only problem is that this should not have failed on a Toyota with 75K miles (the Aisin on my Scion did the same).  I will still install these rather than any other maker on the market.  The compatible car list was wrong as it does fit a 2010 Camry with 2.5 engine
B001G7KJLG|5|Works and Fits perfectly.
B00KQ131A4|5|Bought as a present and recipient loved it
B0081T3PP4|5|It worked fine, put it in a the a/c got cold
B0089IFQR2|4|Great lights, but no electrical sockets included! They should have mentioned that part!
B00496WZRW|5|Got it in a decent amount of time and was exactly what I needed
B004IYZMUW|2|The motor would not work at first, making me question my diagnosis.  After a few seconds it started moving with a screech then and continued to be noisy after a few back and forth cycles.  This one will come back on me.
B0067ECTZW|5|Its and oil filter.
B00IS94TEI|5|Fit well looks good.
B002ZBWKAU|5|Never again will I have to go to a gas station and worry about having enough quarters to put in the machine for air.  This product keeps me from having to drive from gas station to gas station looking for air machines.  I can now fill my tires in the parking garage at work, at home, or wherever I am.  It's easy enough to use once you figure out the green buttons and how much air you really should have in your tire.  It is fairly quick and seems accurate enough.  It is loud, but when you're outside or in a parking garage it's not a big deal.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone who does a lot of traveling with kids and needs the convenience of being able to add air to the tires at any time.
B0076PXV4Y|5|Good product  gracias
B00SH33Y00|1|Lights did not work
B00LLKHMV8|5|Amazin mod for those that own a 2nd Generation Fusion! Will break necks even more and looks really good.
B00VNJ15LK|2|Product did not meet expectations as it was too small to fit my 2005 Scion Xa, in addition one of the clips for securing the cover arrived broken.  In my opinion the clips utilized for securing the cover to the car at best can be described as flimsy.
B00CQAQXH6|5|Easy install and looks great.
B00ICG3GBE|2|Looks cheap
B00IJ6INAG|5|Had these babies on in 30 seconds! They are beautiful on my 2012 Jetta!
B003U4P3U0|3|This stuff is ok but not great. I got more suds out of other chemical guys products. The smell is nice but attracts bugs while washing.
B00CP4UZ1I|1|I enjoyed it at first, but in this short period of time, none of the white lights are working
B00UVVQHJ6|5|Was what i kneeded
B0000AXV3T|5|I gave been using this model for over 10 years now. I have found it drastically reduces the mineral and chemical content of the water i take aboard. Before using this in some places the water was so loaded with minerals it would foul up my plumbing and vacuum head systems in a matter of weeks or months. Once i switched to use these filters on all new water, the plumbing problems went away, all my equipment (pumps, vacuum seals, duckbill valves etc) all last vastly longer.<br /><br />The water also tastes much better without most of that junk the cities put into the water.<br /><br />Just remember to change it about every 6 months, or when the water flow starts to decrease.
B00V901JQ4|5|much easier to use than the 1 piece shades.  especially at this size.
B000MD3EVC|3|Bought it because it was rated high. For me it did not initially work as advertised. Initially gave it a &#34;1&#34; rating. It has a large grease fitting that would not fit on a smaller driveshaft U-Joint. Testing it of an open grease fitting, was very difficult to remove since someone at the manufacturer over torqued the adapter, requiring installation in a vise and using a pipe wrench to loosen. The fitting could not be adjusted at all until I did that, and after first install on grease fitting was almost impossible to remove or allow adjustment of grip on fitting during greasing. I can use it now. It is average quality, at this point would not buy another of this item at this price.
B00068XCQU|5|did everything it promised to do
B00P6OPF3M|4|Would have give it a five ,but got lost in shipping twice.  A great idler arm at a great price
B00PTJFYVC|5|They are great
B0076PB2U4|1|Broke the first time I used it
B002R0R2H0|5|Excellent.
B00A66GYDA|3|It works, but I purchased a Bosch at O'Reilly's for better and easier use, it did come with a nice booklet to explain the codes, the Bosch stated to get online for codes, yuck!
B00JVHLS3G|2|Emblem turned yellow after about 3 days of being on my car.
B01093PU2K|5|These are wonderful. They give a lot of support and are small enough that I move mine from car to car.  We use them at home, work and in the cars. My kids even use them while doing their homework. Great product.
B00JBI94VS|1|No
B000OO4PWG|5|good stuff
B0035U1WD6|5|Works  good
B00SISD8VY|5|Had an issue with product but the seller made everything right! Bright light!
B001DCN1SC|5|Super easy to install, and works beautifully. Dealership wanted $250 and 4 hours to do the job - I bought these for $60 and did the job in 20 minutes. I am not a mechanic - just an ordinary grandma! I replaced both sides and am amazed at how easy it is to open the lift gate now.
B002LGF7FE|5|Looks way better then I would have thought. I've always had white ones but looks flawless with my new black Mazda cx9. And I love me a some Dave!!!!!
B00H6XPZN6|5|I like these  works great<br />I use it on the drivers side but you need to take off at night and<br />if you need to grab a ticket for parking you need to open your door or take it off, but<br />I think it's worth the trade off.<br />You can leave the suction cups on the window and just take the shade off very easily. I have been using these for at least a month or more now and I'm very happy with them.
B0050LU2GQ|5|I would recommend these for anyone that uses the handicap signs.  So easy to use and keeps the sign clean and keeps from being damaged.
B002BG4WX2|1|Didn't work
B003D4K9TC|5|best buy yet.works great.
B00NEG6JH0|1|Horrible. All but 1 of the lights would randomly flash or not work. I bought some Chinese Samsung ones that are working great now.
B002UJVNFA|5|Fit comfortably. No wind hits my eyes whats so ever as opposed to regular glasses.
B00BW4QNN6|5|Work well and look good on my car. Nice that they didn't require drilling.
B00IPMAAXW|3|Malleable Wire made it useful, but it interferes with forward cup holder. Toyota Corrolla 2015.
B00B2PZBIS|3|I really doubt this filter is any better than the competition in spite of Mobil's claim to the contrary.  It doesn't have any more surface area than the Fram and being such a tin filter it may not be easy to make it better.  It is made in China and the Fram is made in India (as of today, it may change tomorrow) so you take your chances.
B002QEFM8S|5|the plug fits perfectly in a chevy blazer 1999 4.3 vortec, I received 5 plugs in a box for $10 and I thought that it was buying one plug for 10$ . This plug is not magnetic and includes the rubber gasket
B005KLOZ46|5|I love this filter. The chrome looks sharp, and the nut on the end makes replacement fast and easy - and does prevents scratching the chrome during installation.
B000UK1WYS|5|The ONLY plug to use in my Subies(00/01/02 OBW's).  Never had an issue with them.  Just re-gap every 20-25k and replace after 40-50.  A friend of mine is a 25 year Subie master tech.  He told me to never use the expensive plugs in them...just the cheap NGK's.  Said he's seen countless cars come in with running issues and it was simply because the owner switched to some platinum model which apparently they do NOT like to run on in some cases.  Cheaper is better here!
B00FYX204C|5|This fit perfectly in my 2015 GMC Yukon.  Love it!
B0108EYWU6|5|this is the best 17.99 I ever spent! the color is so bright that is made my car go from tan colored blah to bright and cheery!!! it was also  supposed to take over a month to get here and it got here in two weeks!! wwooooo hhhoooo
B0024WU1UG|5|This worked great to clean brake dust out of the triangular nooks and crannies of my rims (photo attached). A snug fit makes for a nice scrubbing action. However, the Sonax was too big to fit into the other diamond-shaped patterns on my rims but a 1&#34; foam brush works for that.<br /><br />This style wheel is a nightmare to keep clean and the Sonax goes a long way to making cleaning less of a hassle.
B00LC65T98|5|awesome light very versatile thank you
B00MXXYUEY|5|Arrived and works as advertised
B001T7JWN4|5|The best brass cleaner that I have found. Thank you
B00E41P8NA|5|Love this decal
B00K8VQE7Y|5|Great quality.  Fits perfect in a 2012 Honda Accord. Vibrant colors!  Husband loved it.  He is a huge marvel fan.
B00KTIYXLU|5|Works well and took all of 3 minutes to program. Bought for spare and don't use them very much, but seems to work as the original.
B0015KH93K|5|Ordered this to replace leaking A/C schrader valves on 1995 Honda accord.  It worked even better than expected.<br />I was initially a bit confused by the instructions and the complexity of the tool and worried it would leak but the tool seems to have o-rings that prevent leaks around the shaft even when the lock ring is loose.<br /><br />The instructions in the kit are pretty clear and I found that the valve remover shaft 'pops out' due to pressure in the system, just like the instructions said.<br /><br />The slotted end of the tool has not only a slot, but also a hole to accept the tip of the schrader valve.<br />This hole (rather than the slot itself) is actually what 'latches on' to the very tip of the schrader valve and holds it in place.<br />So that prevents the valve from falling off the slotted shaft during both removal and installation.<br /><br />I also slightly loosened the schrader valve with another tool, prior to using this tool, just to prevent undue stress on the slotted end<br />(since another reviewer said that his tool broke at the slot).<br /><br />There was no country of manufacture listed anywhere I could see.<br /><br />But the tool seems to be solidly built (brass, aluminum, steel, etc) and the case is a nice bonus.<br />I was happy that there were no leaks around the R134 high or low-side quick compression fittings.<br /><br />I did need to use a small adjustable wrench to tighten up the high-side flare R134a adapter to the body, since the flats were not 'tall' enough for a standard open-end wrench to fit (would have needed a thin 3/4&#34; wrench like a bike spanner wrench).<br /><br />The honda A/C schrader values are both standard schrader valves although they do have slightly longer depressor stems<br />compared to standard bike tire / auto valves. (This is true; they are 3/16&#34; long instead of about 1/8&#34;.)<br />I have a lot of bike-tire schrader valves on hand so I ended up replacing both stems with these.<br />I did not have exact replacement on hand and initially wanted to only remove them to check the size,<br />since I had heard in another review that the valve stems are longer on the Honda compared and that a standard value would be too short and prevent re-charging due to inability of recharge hose to fully depress the stem.<br />However, this tool made it so easy to remove the valves that I ended up using the bike tire valves anyway since they at least don't leak.<br />Hopefully they will hold up. (I am not sure what the seal material is supposed to be, teflon, neoprene, etc).<br />Also, if needed, this tool makes it so easy, I can quickly put the original valve back in, top off the system, and then change back the valves.
B00AQ29GA2|5|They are cool!<br />They didn't break or anything I had someone else install them for me but they fit perfectly my Hyundai Elantra 2010.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Makes a big difference inside the car
B00CTB87Z8|1|They didn't smell
B002MA03YE|5|I moved from MA to FL and had this on my roof for the whole trip; nothing inside got wet and it didn't move.  I did use two extra straps to hold it down however.  Great product for the price.
B00APOFQYQ|5|The product was received as expected, in a timely manner and well protected by packaging. Definitively, I would recommend this to a friend.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Not only does this product work, but I have experienced the BEST customer service from this company!  We have four total (2 packs) of these for my large SUV.  I stack two per window in the back seat for the best coverage.  It provides sun protection for my little one, while still allowing him to see outside.  Highly recommend!
B0073Q48TI|5|These mirrors are really awesome. Well constructed and fits perfectly. I had some other mirrors from Dime City Cycles. They were not very good. One flew off when I went over 120mph!
B003ZWG6T4|5|Great product!
B000BQU24C|5|Only Time can really tell how well its made.  But as of right now.  It secures my 3XL full face helmet nice and snug.  It does say it has a 15lb test strength.  But for a 12 pack, my big helmet, or my lunch sack and jacket, I feel it will be perfect on my Vulcan 1600 Classic cruiser..
B000BQW5LK|5|This actually didn't screw onto the Red Line quart bottle but it did the job nicely anyway. A must for transferring fluid to the differentials on my truck.
B009DJUATK|5|Works great in my 2006 Chevy Impala.
B000SXCLIS|2|Although advertised as heavy duty, this is not the same Formosa cover I ordered from Amazon/Formosa in 2010. It is much lighter and slightly smaller.  After calling Formosa, I was told they hadn't changed this product in years.  I was able to retrieve my history in Amazon to compare my last order, and the specs were the same.  I explained that I am holding the old and new covers side and there is a BIG difference--the old cover weighed twice as much because the material was twice as thick!.  It was like talking to a robot.  I need to cover my bike, so I will keep it, but I am disappointed that what used to be such a fine product has been downgraded
B0097SDUTY|5|This is the only cleaner that I have used that works, I can feel the increase in power.
B00UW09ELY|2|Received quickly and looked great in box.  Now 2 months later they are full of water. Had moisture in them from day one.  Contacted them about moisture and have not spoke to them since.
B00H2ZOQTC|4|The product was a few days late, but I love it!
B001VZL2LO|2|I tried this on my 2006 TJ Rubicon/4.0 with 6 speed, and had relatively low expectations--as other reviewers noted, many of the features pertain to automatics, the ability to reset the speedo for different size tires/gears, and the newer JK model. But I wanted a bit more power for a long pull on the interstate heading into northern AZ, and the good news is it does give a boost--noticeable at 3000 RPM and up, which would have been fine. But with the performance tune came pinging, alas. It was OK under heavy acceleration and rowing through the gears, or at least I couldn't hear it with all that lovely normal Jeep noise--but in 5th and 6th gear and trying to accelerate with the engine reasonably into the power curve, it gave a lovely rattle of gravel-in-a-tin-cup pinging. And that is not something I want to live with for the relatively modest increase in power. Other, minor frustration was getting the drivers loaded--took four tries on two computers before Windows Update (after a LONG search) found and installed the right drivers, and I was then able to update the tuner. So for you JK users, I wouldn't rule it out, and maybe you'll get different results on other TJs. But for me, it is return requested....
B00546F77G|5|great product
B00GBQ741K|5|Has not collapsed on the 3&#34; intake of my ported EFR 6258 running 32psi. Very impressed!
B00KCQSIG0|5|Beautiful!
B00U1PAVB2|5|lowered my cube almost three inches and still has the perfect ride!!  I can not even tell there is no more suspension travel left.  this is by far the very least expensive way to lower your ride!!  and you can fully adjust amount of lowering turn by turn and it is so easy to install even a non-mechanic can do it easily with one wrench (I think 10mm box end wrench is best, no sockets, not even deep sockets will fit, but the new pass-thru type might)
B00ANQ6P1E|5|Very compact
B001OCVC78|1|I really haven't had time to look at the quality.  Three have been shipped to me and every one was damaged when it arrived.  The manufacturer should do a better job of packaging.
B0039VPGH4|5|Great workmanship but wrong color.  Returned and ordered Cashmere.
B000EQR5YE|5|Part fit my 1999 Silverado perfectly.  Shipping was as advertized.
B0029KF58G|5|Nice product. Delivered fast. Great value. A+++++
B001KNYO26|5|Great!
B00AZOJB2O|3|Worked but don't seem to match the factory clips exactly.
B001NYE24C|4|It fits correctly, which always a concern on this particular hose.
B003EOXKRY|2|The windshield  channel I received does not hold my safari top tightly flushed against the front windshield, leaving a sloppy fitting gap. This means there is major leakage when you get caught driving in a sudden rain, downpour or sprinkle. Seems like they could have engineered it better for a better fit, added a third clamp in the middle as there are only two spaced far apart. The clamps themselves, even when screwed in all the way still has some play and can be moved around if you jostle the thing a bit. What  can I say? I'm  just glad the thing doesn't just fall off driving  down the road! For that, I give it two stars instead of one and I think I'm being pretty generous here!
B004RCX6Z8|5|This was the perfect match to what came on the trailer.  Excellent price too
B00NGQK9YW|5|Perfect. Clear pocket JUST fits a Garmin Zumo 660LM. Magnets seem strong, bag is well built.
B001BHTCXW|4|Only had them for a few days. I've rubbed some leather conditioner on them a couple times and they look to be very well made.  Made a dumb mistake and laced and tied them before snapping the first time, don't try that hehe. They feel very comfortable, not tight at all around my foot. Holding off a five star until I see how they take some serious riding. My only con I can think of is the &#34;X&#34; emblem on the snap is pretty sharp and pointy and you have to be aware of where that sucker is when you zip.<br /><br />Few weeks now and still very happy with these. There is a definite dent on the shifter toe though.
B00651C9OI|2|was not giving great reception
B011PKCHKO|4|Seems to be of a high build quality. It is very low profile and does not protrude past frame.
B000C5813G|5|Made in Japan. Great quality, so far so good since installed.
B00E4ZBX12|4|Back seat mats did not properly fit 1997 TJ
B00M2QMHK6|4|Meets my needs for a low profile seat. Comfortable and easy to move around
B0063CV8S2|5|Stick-on application and fit my 2006 Nissan Altima perfectly. Product was just as described.
B00GEIAJCQ|5|worked great
B00E0NSL54|5|First of all this product smells amazing and works amazing as well. The way I use and works best for me is spray it twice and use a microfiber towel to wipe it off. Fold into four sides and there you go.
B00DF7C4O0|5|Worked fine.
B000ARPVOI|5|Have used this in my older toyota for a year now when there was a noise (valves?) and after a week of using it, the noise stopped.  When I run out of product and stop using, the noise comes back.
B00HAWH3AG|5|10 minute replacement
B000CN52SA|5|Excellent product and excellent transaction,,, Thanks!!!
B00527Z664|5|Needed the Extra power when using my note book in a vehicle.
B003ZZM1FY|5|looks good
B0015PKQDK|5|Worked like a charm!  Would buy again.
B007NVS9M0|4|I used it in 85-95 deg weather with all the vents on my motorcycle jacket closed and it worked great! When we arrived for lunch and I took my jacket off, I was too cool and had to remove the shirt.
B00T4N6DTQ|5|Great for wiping down a glass enclosed shower.....bought it for the car, but it never made it out of the house....
B00Q1F76WS|5|Good fit, reasonable price. Looks like the OEM one.
B0065S6S8Y|5|Worked perfect no problems.
B000HEBR3I|5|Very pleased with product.
B008G32B1O|5|They work great! better than ones I replace. I would buy again fast shipping
B00IAARHTO|5|Wife loves this ... matches the license plate frames I bought for her
B000X1E59S|5|works perfect
B0001XPC7C|4|Fits a lot of coins (quarters, nickels, dimes) and small enough to in the front compartments in my vehicle!
B0012BL8LG|5|It works great. I have a car product that requires updates and the easiest way to power up the product is the schumacher pc-6.
B00B9H3YXS|5|Easy to install. Works as promised, and so far seems just as good as the OEM part that came with the car (2003 Nissan Sentra).
B0024DYM3M|1|Buyers  Beware  This green tarp  is the poorest  workmanship  quality I've ever seen<br />It is 2 or 3 pieces  sewed  together  with the  seams  showing and  unraveling  NOW<br />THIS ITEM IS A PURE WASTE OF MONEY ,  and looks awful
B0024E6UE0|5|Easy to install and does the job.
B004JBW4QY|5|Nice alternative to paying the dealership price, and with the same quality.
B002IEKXS0|4|It is littile bit shorter,and the wire connecter is a bit loose,but still very useful
B0057NS0RK|5|Quiet when cruising. Loud when you want to get on it. Deep sound. 2014 durango.
B004ZF4MO6|5|what i expected. works good.
B00LBMXSZK|5|Easy installation. Holds my phone great. Very sturdy product. Recommended to all !
B000HZA2ME|4|Nicely packaged, seem a little bit &#34;weak&#34; to handle my Raptor's power but I'm yet to test them out there in the mud.
B0009IR056|5|Worked great to replace my craftsman Brigs and Stratton filter .
B00HHGSTEE|4|So far they bolted up like they are supposed to and as of now they have driven just fine. They came on time and seem to be as advertised.
B00180860W|5|Welding shop was happy with quality, easily welded on and made gorgeous welds.
B003UT3S6Q|5|5 star
B003NI5GVO|1|Cheap. Broke after a few uses
B007RRLG8E|5|Been looking for Guardian Bells for quite some time and I just wanted something different. I found this bell that fits my husband to a &#34;T&#34;. Exactly as described and looks great!
B00X4EARUM|5|This kit is Awesome ,I've had this 1988 fourtrax since new and never had anything done to it..but now it's like new.
B001V8U12M|5|Love this adapter for the drill, makes dropping the stabilizers so easy.
B00UG52P7U|1|too small
B000C9I4AM|4|does the job
B00OPZ4GXS|5|Very good quality. IT is difficult to place if your not experienced in placing car decals, yet this is a good sign as it will keep the sticker on your car.<br />The REFLECTIVE qualities are great. Reflects from a good distance. Mine did include the &#34;JEEP&#34; square sticker that the picture has fuzzed out. However, yours MIGHT NOT have that square. Nice thing is, you can cut each square out independently if you wish to place in the order  you wish.<br />I would buy again.
B008X6QS90|4|This product was good. It was everything I expected, but sadly mine didn't come labeled by color. I used these on my XBOX controller as many of you are hoping to. The LEDs are bright I don't know the MCD but the Green, Red, and Yellow LEDs were bright. The blue and white were very dim and could barely be seen through the XBOX controller. I found out the colors by soldering them onto the XBOX controller an testing it to find the color. Over all this is a good product. Would reccomend to those looking to mod their Xbox controller. Shipping was amazing too.
B00MOFO5T6|5|Very high quality GTO sign looks great on the wall in the garage. Better yet it is a reminder of when I owned my GTO.
B000V2P0FW|3|I have an eye-level GPS that I rely on, but its nice to have a physical map to look at an overview of a road trip.  This pouch works very well, although the Velcro strap isn't a perfect fit.  Also, the tabs at the bottom are too thick to allow the gas door to close on my 2002 Goldwing.  I suppose I could grind out some of the ridges in the door, but I'd rather not.  It stayed put with just the Velcro on a 1500 mile trip, but it would be better if the tabs were a thinner material to fit in the door.
B00VXFKGE6|5|I love this spray nozzle and have used all the differently settings.  There is a hand down clip so I don't have to keep my thumb on the handle all the time.  I would highly recommend this and the price point was very easy on the budget
B000ALG8LO|5|Great Product, Great Price!
B000GS8NZK|3|OK, look a little cheap.
B00ECXSZRG|5|Getting it was hastle free and it is great quality. Love it!
B0065KKXL0|5|Good quality. Works on a lot of things.
B00OUULK00|4|Excellent color match and works like a charm.  Longevity is unknown at this point.
B006H82BKG|1|They look nice but to bad they don't fit my Ultra.
B00OX1WIT8|1|I was only able to use it for about a month. It started to rip and the elastic band that goes around the headrest didn't stay tight and I had to keep retightening it.
B00G5RTYYK|5|Awesome product. Exactly as described.
B00T94Z7KQ|4|Easy to wrk with, heat shrank ok
B00BT19PG4|4|Good product but with no connectors sent you have to spend more money on the connectors. Other brands come with the necessary connectors at a similar price
B00026Z3BS|5|Great jack for the money - fast delivery!
B003S6F3IC|3|Fit was okay, quality was a little low.  Noisier than original, the only good part was it's cheap.
B0031ZDU62|5|All of them are working well at this stage. Great service.
B0019O6GE0|3|I try to avoid using these, but a lot of customer's won't pay for Delco or Delphi units.  I've only had a couple fail out of over a hundred Airtex pumps installed, but they tend to be noisy.  Much better price here than at the local parts store.
B004WPZGQW|5|These are a decent reproduction for a fraction of the price of O.E.M. you cant tell the difference while standing and looking at them.
B003Z9UUUS|3|For the price its pretty good.  Keeps  my stuff dry and clean and really adds to the utility of the bed.  My only complaint is that the vinyl flaps a bit in the wind which makes a rattle noise against the aluminum frame.  Annoying, but the other options were like over $500 more with a solid cover so you get what you pay for.
B00EC2CKW8|5|work GREAT!!  Perfect what we wanted them for.  We are using them to hold our solar blanket on our above ground pool, when we are using our pool.
B0002MB80C|5|It took a fair amount of pulling and yanking, but once I got it on, this cover has been great. It doesn't move around, and doesn't smell bad. The leather looks and feels very nice. I wish it covered more of my steering wheel-- the edges are pretty far away on the inside-- but overall this is a great product.
B002UC14JW|5|Worked well and it arrived in a timely manor.
B00HV2CKZ8|1|Maybe mine came defected,but it didnt fit and wont stay on my Scion wont even click on to lock once installed,It didn't come with instructions!!Only way I think I can install these light's on my car is with J.B Weld or screws to stay on!!Never again from this SELLER!!!
B005CWR5PO|5|Fit perfect ran good with a little tuning
B00FEREYL0|3|This size was to tight
B000KITSMI|5|Excellent.
B00BJIUAX4|1|I had bought these before the winter not thinking anything of it. They looked nice, but now I can't get them off. My local garage tried to get them off to no avail. Now it's going to cost me $800 to have them cut off and replace the valve stems which are also part of the tire sensor system. Hard lesson learned
B001COAS78|5|Excellent.
B000C8PAS2|5|Excelente producto
B007TY6A72|4|Fit perfect and easy to install.  Not five stars due to the electrical circuit seems to be reversed.  It only plugs in one way and the window switches are backward.  Up is down and vice versa.  Thought about rotating the switch but the driver side control would still be opposite.
B00BD4SM9S|5|I like the style, texture, and it really fits my cars sets.
B00HYI278O|5|Perfect fit for my Honda Accord 2015.  Looks so good and cleans well.
B00G9QJ6KY|5|It was the right part so it does what I wanted it to do.
B001H1O688|5|Easy to put on and off. Give good security if and when you need your gas tank shut. This comes with two keys so do not misplace them! I attached them to my car keys right away to be sure.
B000IYJJ0A|5|Excellent product, perfect fit for my old 65 D100!!!
B0052FRWF4|5|Received as expected, fits perperctly
B008QYX9H8|1|Simply would not work with my GPS app of choice, Waze. Had no problem pairing it with my iPhone 6 plus. Conceivably the problem could be with Waze, but in any event have to return it.
B0034Y2VS8|5|Been buying for 2014 Honda Accord.  Dealer says they are superior filters.  Will continue to use. I do however change filter/oil at 8K miles vs. 15 K miles.
B00J3BLRSQ|5|Lift kit worked great. Added a nice look without going to far. Bushing kit was self explanatory. Not for all do it yourselfers. It was a long process to burn them all out.
B00CPBW6LS|1|BLECH!  Not at all like the picture
B000T02H98|1|Budge sent me this as a replacement for another cover (not tyvek) that failed long before the warranty ended. Been using it (for the first time) almost 2 months this summer on my like-new-condition '94 Eddie Bauer Explorer (under 10k miles, garage kept most of the year and regularly washed and polished with Nu Finish).<br /><br />I'm not happy; actually I'm kinda angry. It trapped moisture and ruined my paint.<br /><br />It did seem to protect against both sunlight and that fine dust that gets thru some covers after a steady rain. Uncovered it yesterday; after 2 weeks without being driven/uncovered. The leading edges of the fenders, roof lines, etc. have very, very fine scratches/rub marks that look like someone took 1000-grit sandpaper to the paint where the cover was in direct contact. The paint also has quite a few spots/areas with water stains and streaks; obviously the &$#@! thing does not breathe and was trapping moisture.<br /><br />This cover did more harm than good; in a short period of time it's pretty much ruined what was like new factory clearcoat metallic paint.<br /><br />Tyvek might be OK as a house wrap but as a car cover material it stinks big time and should be avoided.
B00EC102WE|5|Fits perfectly!
B004AG9ILM|5|Used on BMW 135i n54. Replaced 1 bosch coil on my car and it worked great.
B00UP51A3G|3|I received the decal in a timely manor, and thankfully that it was the color i ordered. It has been on my jeeps windshield for months now, and covered regularly in mud. It has held up very well.<br />The issue in have with this decal is that it was double imprinted. You can see hi haters twice but only one set of letters were laser cut. It looks bad up close.
B000CBTGKC|2|Installs very easy but is designed for specific models but does not fit those models correctly.  I need to cut the plastic to make it fit properly.
B00MGIYHJ4|5|Great product.  It arrived on time. It was a perfect fit on my old Seadoo.  I have been working it hard on the last half of this great summer and it works perfectly.
B004MUHKHU|5|Excellent faucet. Easy instructions. Works great for our RV shower.
B00BD4YMFQ|4|Enjoyed them
B005FK81A6|5|The best brakes ever. My wife had complained about her noisy brakes so I replaced them. She complained with the new brakes as well. I bought these brakes and rotors as a package and installed them they are the best. I then put a pair on my son's car, he is very happy with them. I recently drove my wife's car and realized that it stops much better than the new Lexus I am driving.<br /><br />The price was right, buy these first.
B000C9KTQ4|4|Running smooth xc90
B00BGRDN6O|5|Fit perfect, easy to install and make a huge difference in the looks and handling of the jeep.
B0066T4V9K|4|Been doing good and got ride of some noises
B00M47RIO8|5|works great nice
B004YJU0KS|5|Great lift 5 inch in front need to adjust to your specs. Was delivered in few days. Smooth ride PERFECT for my 2005  Nissan Armada. Could not beat the price. GOOD PRODUCT RIGHT PRICE AND AMAZON COME THROUGH RIGHT ON TIME. I STAND BY THIS PRODUCT!
B000C2Y0IO|3|I've got my fingers crossed on this one as I usually won't use Chinese water pumps.  Installed on a '93 Park Avenue Ultra - not a fun job that you want to do again in two years.  None of the available options appealed to me, even some of the Delco branded pump are cheap Chinese.  I only chose this Gates based on their other quality parts and hope they specified some bit of quality to put their name on.
B002M2MHHI|5|Slightly different than pictured. Doesn't have the brass piece as shown in the picture. (Wouldn't work with that zirc fitting location anyway)<br /><br />Great quality
B00IPL1EGU|5|love um
B005SEJRSE|5|Can't complain, creamy
B00GZJ9MR2|5|It was the only way I was going to grease a fitting with a metal bar 1 inch over it, it made it so easy I may just use it on all of them in the future.
B010C9X51Y|3|Only 3 stars at the moment, as I have not installed this item yet. I'll provide an updated review once I've installed it.
B006MIWA6Q|5|Love this spare tire cover. It completes the look on my Jeep and has held up beautifully in the weather. At first it has a few crinkles and wrinkles, but with time these have smoothed out. A great fit and a great buy.
B002D7KKW6|5|Exactly correct. And on time
B004BT68CU|5|outstanding service & parts. I am completely satisfied with the timely receipt & quality of these parts.
B0023VF0DQ|5|I received the item in a timely manner and it was exactly what I needed. Both the seller and product are great!
B000X25QB8|5|It is just what I wanted.  Protection from spills.
B004S3I8S6|5|Good product!
B0009IBJE4|4|It appears to be doing the job. Definitely not the heavy duty chargers they use to make. So far so good but time will tell on longevity!
B0093XLGVM|1|Everything about these parts are terrible. I've had to try 5 different times with 3 different sellers and several calls to Amzon to get a bulb that worked and i never got one. i have a mound of bent and broken bulbs, and none of them lit up when plugged in. They were all packaged horribly and damaged beyond use even before they got to me. From the other review, they appear to be weak and dim at best. I highly recommend looking for a different bulb. These are terrible.
B000143LHY|4|I love this stuff - it really clears out weird car smells.  Unfortunately, it seems like it must be used once a week to really work and it leaves an odd pungent smell for a few hours.  This is still 100% better than using some nasty Christmas tree air freshener.
B00BWU2VKE|5|Quality is very high and shipped quickly.
B00PV7K0FC|5|Just love my new ashtray
B01093QDWQ|5|I spend a lot of time at the computer and this Gelepad saves me so much pain and related stress! The padding so comfortable and supportive. What a fabulous invention! It stays right where I put it and the adhesive is so flexible, I can travel with it and use it anywhere. Even after a year of use, it still provides support and adheres to any desktop like new.
B00U4H649K|5|It is perfect :)
B0068FYB4C|5|No hassle
B001KO7BQQ|4|Quality product!
B004J38I3U|2|Replaced everything and the carb still leaks. The main gasket was falling apart as soon as it touched gas...already ordering another brand
B000IYA6KM|5|Works great for 91 CRX DX
B007PSRF0I|4|Shipping was fast. Product was very well protected as it is heavy and most UPS or FedEx people probably wouldn't care if it got damaged but it came in 100% condition. The bumper itself was beautiful and the finish on it was exceptional it seems as if it would hold up for a very long time. It looks great and fits great too. It is about 3/4 of an inch off though however its so close that you can only notice it when putting the tailgate down. The other thing was because I had an aftermarket hitch I had to take off the hitch, put the bumper on, and then put the hitch back on. Overall great product.
B0067PUMXW|5|They are great stickers, I put them on my truck. They have held up to 4 wheeling and lots of rain and sun. They are about the size of a grown womans hands
B0002Q80RW|5|Nice product. Delivered fast. Great value. A+++++
B00P1LVCQE|4|That  work perfect . .nice product
B00D29P5CO|5|Awesome
B00VZH418O|1|This is the worst product i have bought here at Amazon, only used it for one hour two pieces broken, the glue doesn't work, i couldn't fix any dent in my truck... finally i returned it and got my money back. Good luck.
B00XULVDHK|5|Love these shades. Thank you.
B00KMBPGYM|3|Works well but bit too long for my CUV and had to make it work to fit.
B000BOAX1G|5|This tiny blind spot mirror has made huge difference in my driving experience.  Initially I fixed it at the farthest end of my side view mirror then I felt it was blocking most of the view in the side view mirror so I removed and fixed it at the closest end of rear view mirror which is perfect for me. I get a good view in the rear view mirror as well as in the blind spot mirror. The glue is sticking really good for 2 years even after I removed and fixed it again. Now I hardly look at the side view mirror as this one got a broader view which gives me confidence before the lane shift.  This one also got swivel mechanism, when you rotate it you change the angle to a different direction and it covers more area in the direction the lowest depth of circular frame is pointing. This mirror also helps while parking and reversing the car, the parking spot lines are fully visible on both side so you will be sure you park in the center of the spot even when no car is parked in adjacent slot. Also the curb will be visible while parallel parking.  Because of all these features I miss these mirrors when I rent a car. I'm very satisfied with this purchase and I highly recommend this product!  If you found my review helpful, please click the yes button below.
B00757KJTI|2|Looks good installed. There is a loss of reception ( HD to normal) and I live in the city too. Packaged well and arrived on time. Thinking about reinstalling factory or a 5-13 inch antenna that won't bend at the car wash.
B00X8S9CRI|4|Very easy installation
B00N7KNI1S|5|I've only had this for one day but I was very impressed with the weight. Very nice, heavy. Seems well made. I order another one on the same day I received the first one.
B0058EQF6G|3|Good price but the chrome is bumpy and rough.
B004A69BM8|5|The conversion package was complete and relative easy to install.  It took roughly 6 t0 8 hours to install.  The Mustang now drives beautifully.
B001RAQGXC|2|did not work
B007QBX1X4|5|Good
B0009H528E|4|does the job
B0002STRTU|5|Being an auto tech and on flat rate, I use this socket about 2 times a month. GREAT investment and a bunch cheaper than Snap-on, Matco, Mac and Cornwell. 5 stars
B000ES5N3W|5|As expected! No complaints here
B00K65DIVC|5|Easy install and made my jetta whole different car!!!
B00ADIHUVG|5|I love ctek products this is perfect when ya need just a little more cable
B002UC2UB8|5|good product
B000FPYHOU|5|Clock in car went haywire, who wants to spend a lot to fix it?  This works perfectly.
B00BTGSIA8|5|good product
B0082OYG3I|4|just right
B002BASW5W|5|Great quality as always
B00CFQKMBY|5|Good spring, Good price, Fair shipping rate
B003QIRNLC|5|worked great
B005BNYZOI|5|My current TT was delivered with a black cover. I purchased this one which more closely coordinates with my TTl color.
B000CQFS0O|5|Does what it is made for what else is there to say
B004HO4E7K|1|Waste of money faulty product
B004MBXY5Q|5|Great tool for work does it's job nicely. iI also works on the tires of dunces who park in stupid places just a light twist and they come back to 4 flat tires
B00760RHGM|5|Worked like a charm and delivered fast!  Would buy again.
B0037UVQEE|5|It works just fine .
B00NXRXH8O|5|Great value!!
B0070Y363C|1|I want my money back it came broken in little pieces not even reparable. Also all of the wires are unsafe and exposed. Very annoying.
B0119EOBQO|5|my head is 57 cm and helmet feet very good. it's very comfortable and has light weight.
B0006JJ588|5|works great
B00QMWQROI|1|I didn't purchase them
B006J1AT0K|5|perfect fit, easy install 1/2 hour, you can feel the handling change
B002696FA2|5|Great
B00PAT2D2E|5|I like
B00JF5LRN0|5|It is perfect for the trip,saved us lots of room in the vehicle
B00IV5QTVU|5|great boots<br />can wear them all day long
B006ZVITPG|5|Well packaged, fit well, works as it should.
B005JUOG9W|5|Just a very classy vanity plate that creates a very clean and classy look for my bumper!
B001DRP9VY|5|Excellent.
B0097DIJRW|5|Worked great, first installation was a bit hassle, but held up to my expectations.
B001F0IE7A|5|Great solidly built product with quality hardware, and makes it so my 17' boat fits straight into my garage, pretty sweet setup.
B0009IQZFM|5|If you're going to be washing or drying a full size SUV or truck I totally recommend at least 3-4 of these clothes for time saving purposes. It sucks up water like crazy and once fully wet, even after being rung out, I found my self pausing frequently to continuously ringing out this rag. I found that I just let it air dry for about 15 minutes in between uses it worked well, hence why I would recommend having multiples to cycle through them during the drying process.
B004PBXT6C|5|GREAT PRODUCT! Recommended to multiple friends as well!<br /><br />I have an 05 gsxr 600. It's my baby! I was looking for frame sliders to protect against any damage in case of a fall. I purchased some from a few sellers and these were the best BY FAR. They are very durable, not too heavy , and will get the job done. I also went through some of their customer service, and I can personally say that they are one of the best on Amazon! Instant reply and they really seem to care about their customers. 5/5 stars this product is great!
B00651BIKO|5|When I lost my giant factory antenna on my 2012 Chevy silverado to a tree I bought this. the price is right, comes with many attachments and fit perfectly on my truck in about 2 seconds. looks great and is a quarter of the size of my factory one so I'm not hitting branches off road or roofs in parking garages. as for radio reception its almost the exact same if not the same as the larger factory antenna. No noticeable loss or increase in reception.
B000CSPI3E|5|Exactly as listed, good quality part!
B0062IJOJ2|5|work quite well
B00IFPSB8U|4|Perfect fit. Paid for expedited delivery but probably isn't needed (postal delivery). Part should have come with gasket/o-ring. Had to use old ones. Works great
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Quality gauge.  Feels rugged.  Holds peak pressure.  The wife loves it, dude.  Thumbs up!
B00JN0U4SQ|2|When received it was completly black and now it is bronze and black. The aluminum has changed colors.
B00P3IAYSC|5|Nice work out good
B00B2JCMHM|5|AAAA++++
B00075XCNU|1|Did not fit my 2000 sportrac
B00H72YFTG|5|Love the large size. Works great with no lint.
B000O51VJ0|5|Great little campfire to have in the camper.  No dealing with dirty, buggy wood.
B008Y8L4BY|5|5 stars with one caveat. It was loose in my lighter socket and will not heat up-this in a 2005 Avalanche. Figuring GM had changed something, I ordered the corresponding new socket here and it now fits/works as intended. GM must have made the lighter/socket slightly smaller in diameter as of late. Maybe switched from inches to MM, but you need both to fix it. The P/N of the socket is 25776667 and is available on Amazon for about $10.00.
B00C5TA2QQ|5|Great, kept carrier from moving when transporting small scooter used for mobility.
B00LEBLI82|5|Worked perfectly<br />Thanks
B00O3GNURM|5|Nice garbage can. Has a spot under it for weight, however did not include one.
B00QLU1UES|5|Great price and very fast shipping!!!!!
B00280APQE|3|didnt notice any increase in braking effectiveness, could be that they were installed on the rear.
B00Y2CJ5CQ|5|Excellent! I love it,
B00J1TK1DM|5|Fits
B00TUKXXDM|3|Steering wheel cover is exactly what I wanted, however it is too large for my car.<br /><br />The  frustrating thing is the message I got before ordering assured me it would fit.
B00JBICJ2O|1|After a little less than six months, one of the halos went out and the low beam lights are aimed directly at the ground no matter how much I try to adjust it
B002FRXPEY|1|Can't recommend.  I've had three fail with leaks/noise on the same car in a little over a year.  Customer support is trying, but they can't fix a manufacturing or design problem.  They offer free lifetime replacements, (no refunds) but changing a shock every 6 months is not worth the hassle.  If (when?) the next one fails, I'll have to buy something else.  Maybe I'll gift wrap the next leaky shock for the CEO of Tenneco.
B00150T13G|5|Smells great
B000C5DTSS|4|The ignition switch lock was exactly as advertised, it fit my 1992 Ranger PU perfictly.  Installation was relitivly easy, but did require removal of the steering wheel (need a steering wheel puller).
B00652G4TS|5|I bought this because my Audi has 120k on the odometer but only 20k on the engine. The dealer dropped a new one in just as my extended warranty was about to expire. I figured I should keep tabs on the vehicle now that I'm out of warranty. I wanted to be able to save some money and understand what was going on with the vehicle if I should have to return and pay for various repairs. Which seemed somewhat inevitable since I intend to put another 120k on this vehicle at least.<br /><br />A month after my purchase, I got a check engine light. Running a scan using the BlueDriver, I was able to read the two error codes and research them on the internet. It saved me about $230. I paid $100 for the scanner and the part I needed was $20. The repair would have been $350 at the dealer. I did it myself using a part purchased through Amazon in about 10 minutes. Then I used BlueDriver to clear the check engine light. I drove the car 30 miles and rescanned. The codes didn't come back and my car is running perfectly.<br /><br />This is a great investment. The app is extremely easy to use on my Android phone. I'm not a mechanic and I don't want to become one. Information is power though, and this device is a welcome part of my driving experience.
B001DUEW5A|5|Fits well. Works as expected. Took a few minutes to install.
B003NBFKDK|2|No matter how tight you get all the bolts, the sides still sag down on this. From behind, it looks like something bent the carrier down on both outside edges. Fairly easy to put together at least.
B0041F25CG|5|replaced my old one from Dill
B00CMJC2H6|5|PERFECT !!
B00J3NPOI8|3|It tore trying to get over my tire and I bought it according to my tire chart but it does its job.
B00HRZVC6W|5|Awesome item! Fit perfect in my wife's car!
B00D45XRRQ|5|Excelent.Good price. Easy to install (10minutes )  fast shipping. My tacoma is 2014 single cab without delay wipers.  With this part, now I have wipers with 4 diferent delay  and low and fast wipers.
B0060HVFO2|5|I use this wonderful product monthly on my automobile headlight lens covers. Keeps them shinny, clean and bright. Any trace of yellowing will be instantly removed. Inexpensive, effective and fast. Two thumbs up.
B0009JKGJW|4|seems to work fine but I'm not a mechanic
B00IKPVM54|5|I have been using these four several months now, and I haven't had a single problem!
B00BCRMAR6|3|I really like the material, but not the fact that they come in sections instead of one piece. The rear section is not a good fit for my 4Runner. Delivery was delayed several times, though stated it was due to the delivery company. Somewhat satisfied with the product.
B00T7GYDTC|5|I bought this for my atv and it works great.  The amps are on the high side for my older four wheeler aside from that all is good
B002GU2OP6|5|Worked as expected
B000GOHUVM|5|Great value. Solved the squeaky blower motor problem I had in the used 2005 Tundra I bought.
B003CE283I|5|I had this on my previous TT and didn't know how much I missed it on my new TT. So, I just had to get another. Sure saves time from having to place wood under the electric jack.
B010Q4KAM2|5|I love it
B007SW2O2U|1|Cheap Junk, outer layer will tear off revieling harder plastic ribbed grip underneath. Rubber exterior is just a cosmetic cover poorly attached over a pre existing design. If you bought these and are going to use them Make sure you only put them on once and leave them on. Trying to remove them will destroy them.
B00726MXOQ|5|Well worth the money..
B009XIR8CS|1|Ordered two of these.  One came with hardware the other did not.  Still trying to get the hardware for the second one!
B00H7OOSSM|3|nice seats , look great but not like photos . no red stitching in seat or back only on arms. hard as a rock not comfortable at all . seems like a deadly design for head to hit plastic in head area without wearing head gear . I bought these for price and looks never race nor off road only on occasions do ride on beach . will replace them with more comfortable seats at some point ,
B001COYCXY|1|Not what I expected, very hard to wrap gun with. There were a lot of creases and it turned out very bumpy.
B00COYNVPQ|5|Cute container!
B007ACZW1I|5|works well.
B00A7EQF8A|5|I find myself using these all the time. I wish I had bought them earlier. They do a great job and do it as well as the high priced ones from the tool trucks. So, I have the tools I need and also money to buy other tools too.
B004SRRP6S|2|had occasional battery light come on after installing this alternator -- fortunately i traded in the truck before this alternator failed completely.
B001L9VTMW|4|the lettering is a little jagged in some corners, but they all seem to be fairly good looking.<br />for $2, eh, its not a GOOD deal, but a decent one none the less. My problem is how the lettering looks a little off
B000QV2D8K|5|Great price, perfect fit.<br />Old hose was &#34;melting&#34; it was so old, ha
B00BMRZN66|3|The plastic tube had a crack in it and gas went all over.  How do I get a replacement one?
B000C1LLCS|5|Perfect fit
B006LPKK76|5|WOW very good tire cover two BIG thumbs UP
B00EZQK5WS|5|Work's great
B00HTOB0NG|4|got it for someone else
B00EC2CG9U|4|Just as expected.
B004XO8ZCO|4|Box was beat up but the parts were ok works fine
B00HNKYD0I|3|on hot days, it tends too come off in spots!
B00HH486JE|1|Did not receive all the pieces
B004J6EYH6|5|You know...I'll probably go OEM AC Delco from now on.  These are clearly superior to the 'cheapest thing I can find from a brand I've heard about' that I usually put on.
B009F4JHHO|2|Lights seemed to appear fine. It paired to my Galaxy S4, but wouldnt conect in torque or anything. :2006 Chevorlet Silverado
B00AF67MSC|5|great
B002305RZ8|5|fit and worked out great
B001D566IG|5|Perfect fit, quality filter.
B009OBVXSO|5|I like this product and it works great, it also get into those smaller hard to reach spots but it's a little time consuming when doing the WHOLE vehicle as the pad smaller than the larger pads/machines.
B00080QHMM|5|Excellent.
B00ODW40LG|4|They are ok
B00IOZGHCS|5|We got our first golf cart (Yay! We are a &#34;golf cart family&#34; now) and it had been customized in some areas, but other areas had been overlooked. For instance, we have a carbon fiber (!!!) dash but no side view mirrors or seat belts.  So we ordered some safety devices here on amazon including this side view mirror kit.<br /><br />Like the other equipment we ordered, this kit is well made, easy to install and works very well for helping us watch out for cars as we ride our golf cart to the pool or a neighbors house down in the back of the neighborhood.  I would highly recommend this kit to improve the safety of your golf cart. It is quality, easy to install and works very well.
B008RWA7SS|3|Product is ok but 1/2 the tubes of grease are bent
B008B9TQ5W|5|Looks and feels great. Looks good on car, however, it didn't completely cover my license plate, from the side you can see it partially hanging out. It's not bad, but still there. Either way, we love it! No problems
B0002SR4Q8|4|One of the best tools i have purchased for my DIY vehicle maintenance this makes changing oil filter a piece of cake, due to its compact design it makes entering in tight spaces where oil filter is located as the chevy blazer.  Very good tool I would have liked that also included the option to tighten the filter and not only loosen, i not trust in tighten the oil filter with the hand. I think the filter  come loose while I'm driving and occour a catastrophe
B00GRSOJSS|4|It's slow but doesn't smell or produce noxious fumes. When done I still needed to some manual abrasion to remove black deposits so I might as well have just removed the rust manually in the first place. This is good for getting in the crannies. If you want a non-toxic rust replacer (it doesn't actually remove rust, just turns it into something black and scaly) this is for you.<br /><br />Don't soak antique knives in this as it will dissolve fillers they used cover blemished blades.
B000C9TTJM|5|Works as expected. Lost my oil cap, great replacement!
B00WKK48BU|5|great buy!!!! I am very happy with this buy!!!!
B00CFCI36Y|4|For 25 buck a really good set of mats. they have the right weight and thickness where it does feel cheap and not thin at all. The problem is they smell like rubber and oil for almost a week i would let them air out before putting them in your car. Also the spikes on the bottom not that big so the mat does move around a bit when getting in and out but nothing major.
B004WHIUWC|5|finally right part
B004I0HEAC|5|A+
B009D2RH52|5|I am happy, plus quick delivery
B00B0N1XQQ|4|Good fit in the front timing cover and with the hoses. It did set a CEL the next day, but I unpluuged and re-plugged the electrical connection and that seems to have done the trick.
B000HEC8RM|5|You won't go wrong with this one it works great. When mounted in front of radiator it cooled down to 140 degrees F  with outside temp at over 85 degrees F...
B0009KNOT0|5|Great easy to put on .
B00CDC3O1K|5|Decal looks great
B00BTGSID0|5|These are holding up very well. the edges aren't flat anymore, but it doesnt bother me.<br />I've used their workhorse and their yellow, satin edge one and this one is the best of those 3. the Workhorse will no doubt last a long time, but it isn't a fluffy one like this one so you shouldn't use it to wash a car with. The satin one, though softer, it's edge separate from the rest of the towel...
B00BD6UROE|5|Nice addition for your bike. Breaks up all the black, but I like the addition of chrome or aluminum. Nicely crafted radiator cover at a very good price!
B0002U2V1Y|4|I normally buy a different brand, but this was a little cheaper so I wanted to give it a try.  It's definitely softer (less aggressive) than the one I'm used to so that's a plus when detailing a car.  What I didn't like was the spray bottle keeps falling over when I set it on the ground and it doesn't come with a storage case for the clay.
B000BAT622|5|stuff works great!
B0015S698S|5|This is heavenly and just like other reviews yes it splits sometimes but just fill it with braze and move along
B000H6W42Y|3|This product worked. but my hoses where rusty and seized in from road salt and dirt. it took a lot of work to get the hoses out with a WD-40 spray, buy the time i was done so where the tools. I'd recommend a metal or aluminum version if available.
B000BOAX1G|5|Cheap, simple, perfect
B007HRN4N4|4|Worked great.
B00MJAOFKA|5|Perfect. Looks just like the picture.
B00A7EMCMS|4|This bender isn't perfect and certainly shouldn't be considered as your only bender, but it will allow tweaking of an installed line in certain cases and is a  welcome addition to my tool collection.  It really should have longer handles for 3/8 tubing and the spacing of the idler rollers is only a compromise at best; it really should be considered a tweaking tool rather than a bending tool.
B007O5GXOG|5|Truly a plug and play. Install took about 10 min.
B00EI6CKVE|5|Awesome!!!!
B0002F69DK|3|I can see that this formula cleans but, haven't had it on long enough to determine if it protects my awning from fading, especially in the harsh Florida summers. So far-so good.  For some reason there is some discoloration that leaked through from the top to the underneath the awning and that is when I purchased this product. I followed the directions and attempted to remove the stains for several days in a row. Though I attempted to repeat the process for 4 days, there were no improvements on the stain. I gave three stars for this cleaner does clean and may give some protection.
B006GJPS92|4|The title of the product says aluminum,  but somewhere in the description it says steel.  They are in fact made from steel.  2.5&#34; wide by 5&#34; in length.  5/16&#34; center pin hole.
B000X1Y642|5|Perfect fit and very stylish!
B003VGHB9I|5|Perfect fit and shipping was timely.
B00074Q2A6|5|Appears to be well made at a good price.
B009D35UEQ|5|As a owner of a Honda XR600 I really like that this actually fits into the deep dark recesses where the spark plug is located and it is a quality product that should last longer than the motorcycle (or until it gets lost).  I think I'll buy another to keep in the little tool pouch behind the seat that I discovered stays closed better with a little bungee when I lost the OEM spark plug socket somewhere in the great outdoors.<br />The often wrong Amazon automotive recommendation states that this won't fit my XR600, and once again they are wrong; it fits perfectly.
B001ABFWVK|5|good fit, good price
B008427D88|4|All but 2 are in great working shape
B007CZUIG2|5|Exactly as pictured.  Quick delivery. Exactly what I was looking for at a great price.
B00T9AGBOQ|5|This 12,000mAh Mini Car Jumper / Battery Bank is amazing.  It has enough power to jump a car and it also works to charge your devices on the go.  This is now part of my emergency car kit.  It also has a flashlight, strobe light, and yellow/red warning lights.  Those make things very convenient and safe for you when you are broken down on the side of the road.  It also has interchangeable power tips that can charge most laptops or other large electronics that use those ports.  I personally have a Mac so those will be of no use to me.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review.
B00PB4FEXI|3|real cheap and light duty.no where like the oem...but it works and price is right.
B0042CKUM0|4|Great product but the gasket seems to be of poor quality.
B00JW1X2HG|5|worked great, easy installation
B002ESEHF0|4|This worked pretty much as expected. The quick connectors mated perfectly with my Toyota wiring harness. The 4-flat connector wouldn't fit thru the the wiring access hole in the body, so I had to cut the 4 wires, run them through 4 holes I drilled in the rubber grommet, them crimp and heat shrink them. It would have been nicer if the crimp connectors and pieces of heat shrink were included, or better still, quick disconnects in the line that would have made it easier. The color, printed instructions with lots of photos were a nice touch.  I am still puzzled why the positive 12V line from the battery to the controller was black. not red (??). I thought the whole item could have been more competitively priced too.
B002LYQALQ|3|This oiler works decent enough.  I use it for firearm lubrication to dispense M-Pro 7 lubricating oil.  It works as intended, although I have to prime it (open the top while depressing the plunger) frequently.  That is annoying.  On a positive note, I have not experienced any leakage.  Overall, a decent--but not great--product.
B00J8W5Z9C|1|Have absolutely no radio stations...nice for looks but completely useless.....
B00318NVRM|5|The moment these arrived in the package, I knew my life had changed forever. As I took them out of the cardboard box, a halo appeared around my head and music started playing. After installing them in my car, I started driving a TON better and had a lot less accidents. Thank you SYLVANIA for changing my life.
B00VZPA7G6|5|They fit great , and delivery was super fast , thanks again.
B00T47K604|3|Measure the width of your car's seatbelt tongue before buying this.  They do have a warning in the description, and I ignored it.
B00OZQ4C22|5|Fast shipping looks great easy to install
B008XN7NUG|2|At first, I was cussing this piece of equipment, seriously. Had trouble finding the key programming features for the very first car I worked on, a USA 2008 Ford Focus. The system auto detected the car as a 2008. After spending much time messing around, I noticed that I could manually select &#34;2008.25&#34; which is apparently a different car all together (my 2008 was built in late 2007, so 2008.25 doesn't make any sense to me..). Perhaps Ford sold the USA 2007 model in other countries until 2008?<br /><br />Tech support is not good. While I didn't contact them directly, I did view the forums pretty thoroughly and found that most posts were not responded to and those that were had vague answers.<br /><br />The documentation with the unit is useless.<br /><br />This DS708 is considerably slower navigating from menu to menu than the Genisys scanner I used to use. It can take 60-90 seconds to go from choosing the module you want to communicate with to getting to the next menu. This is frustrating as hell if you don't know which module you need to communicate with to perform a job (PATS on many Fords is apparently controlled from the Instrument Cluster - at least according to the DS708).<br /><br />The web browsing is SLOWWWW. The unit bugs you to register every time you turn it on and when I tried to register from the unit itself, I kept getting &#34;network error, try again later&#34;. I ultimately had to go to a PC to do the registration. The time to download and install a 22 megabyte update (on my high speed internet connection) was around 10 minutes. There were around 20 of these updates I could perform, right after removing it from the box.<br /><br />Many forum posts claimed that the 8GB SD Card which is included is too small. Many people were talking about upgrading to 16GB. I haven't used it enough to know personally if that is the case.<br /><br />There were a number of posts talking about corruption of the onboard software and the need to reinstall or restore the SD card from a backup.<br /><br />I've owned this scanner now, a couple of OTC Genisys/Mac Mentor units, and the Auto Enginuity suite. For whatever reason, the Auto Enginuity has always been hit or miss. Sometimes features work (like an ABS bleed or a PATS program), sometimes they don't. A laptop is hard to maneuver inside a car, so it's not great for that reason. They nickel and dime you to death with software upgrades and manufacturer specific programs. Of the three units, so far, I like the Genisys/Mentor the best. The DS708 probably comes a close second, despite it's issues and the Auto Enginuity has been the least helpful of my scan tools.
B00A08QMHW|5|Perfect fit and highly rated filter for my New Holland TC29D.  After the next filter change I'll cut it open and report back what I see inside.
B004PG963M|5|I installed this on the hinge side of a closet door as an alternative to the mechanical ball and spring system that kept getting harder and harder to open.  It works very well, and keeps the door closed.<br /><br />One thing to note, depending on where you install it you may have a lot of leverage when pulling it open.  A 30 inch lever (such as a standard 30 inch door) can reduce the 40 lbs of force to less than 2 lbs.*  I recommend going with the 40 lb model rather than the 20 lb one for that reason.<br /><br />* This is a rough approximation of the actual forces involved, but generally it is easy to open a door secured with these magnets.
B000C9O67M|3|Good products
B00E63THQA|5|I am completely satisfied with this product. The 64oz is a giant and kind of cumbersome to carry, so I recommend purchasing a jug lug. I have seen reviews stating that the cap was easily damaged...This can be remedied with the jug lug, you can easily carry this bottle and handle it minimizing the risk of dropping and damaging the cap. The materials (cap included) doesnt seem any less sturdy than the Hydro Flask, and like the Hydro Flask, the cap can be damaged in a drop. For me, and for this particular size (64oz) the jug lug was a necessity.<br /><br />I also saw reviews stating that the ice melted in the bottle, and it was possibly defective. I can only say with my experience that the type of ice matters. What I mean by this is that when I fill it with ice from my home refrigerator/freezer ice maker, the ice will melt in a short amount of time, but the liquid stays cool for hours; in my experience more than a day, and this is while it was sitting out in a hot car. I dont know exactly how long, because I always drink the water before it gets warm, but despite the ice melting the liquid stays cold. The odd thing is when I fill it with ice from my work place (same ice you would get from a soda fountain machine) the ice does not melt, even for at least half a day. So for the reviews out there stating that there may be some kind of defect, all I can say is that for me, the source of the ice determines whether or not it melts in the bottle, but even if it does melt, the liquid stays cold, and that is what ultimately matters.
B001O7PNNM|5|This stuff is absolutely amazing!!! Gets the toughest of scratches and unwanted marks off your car. Put some on a clean cloth and swirl away. The scratch/mark will come away so easily and without much pressure. An absolute must have for anyone that has a car!
B00KTHY6TU|5|Product arrived on time, instructions were simple, everything works as it should.
B003BQBC5W|4|These add a great look to my 2014 F150. Easy to install and function great. Only downfall is the stock bulbs are dim and have a yellowish tint. I decided to get some replacement bulbs for the projectors. I got the OSRAM - Night Breaker Unlimited H7 Automotive Halogen Bulbs H7. Manufacturer Part Number 64210NBU, ABPA Partslink Number UN2568109 (from here on amazon). These are 55w Vs the 50w that comes with them. they are much brighter and offer a nice clean white light (not blueish). Other down fall is one of the assemblies appears to not have been sealed very well. driving in the rain it does fog up a little in the corner.
B002BG4WX2|1|Slow leak (over the course of a couple weeks to empty) was not fixed. Directions were followed precisely. I'm pondering whether or not it is worth the PITA to pursue the guarantee and het my $25 back.
B000XY6X9A|4|Works exactly as advertised, but priced higher than I want. Regardless, I'm glad I bought it. --1996 Road King
B004ME70YO|1|DON'T buy these.. they pop right off when you are driving!
B00WXO7IL0|5|very good thanks
B00HW58R92|5|Tools are so good
B003FBV8ZW|4|OK so this review is specifically written to help out those who may have been like me and struggled through all the mixed reviews on ALL the inexpensive riding sunglasses that are offered on AMZ.<br />I waited until I road with them. Here is my experience:<br /><br />Amber are super clear for an inexpensive riding set... very very happy with them. They grey though seems to filter  more light so if the amber still leave you feeling the sun is too bright switch glasses. Amber are great for afternoon/dusk riding though. Mid day the grey are easier on the eyes. i wear a half dome lid and no visor, so i get full sun in the face when ui ride. The amber work well unless its cloudless day at noon, then I would probably switch to the grey but I am a bit light sensitive when my Vitamin D is low :)<br /><br />The foam is hard as it mentioned several times. This was sighted as both a positive and negative in certain reviews. I have a large nose (hey I am Italian) and a high bridge so my features are NOT easy to fit to any type of glasses. These will worked well with blocking enough air so that my eyes did not tear. I cruised around town at under 40 mph and they are perfect. I sped up to 60 to see how they would do and although I can feel the air around the eyes a bit, my eyes still did not tear of feel uncomfortable. It wasn't until about 70 mph where I felt the glasses had maybe too much air passes through them.. even then I could still ride, but I will be honest.. I dont enjoy cruising on my Vulcan 1500 Classic at 70 mph anyway. 60-65 tops and under 60 is  my sweet spot for the back roads and general enjoyment. These glasses fit the bill perfectly for that. Ill be honest.. other than a full goggle, I have never had a pair of sunglasses stop air at higher speeds (80 mph or so).<br />The poly lenses are gonna be not high quality which means they will scratch and affect the clarity pretty quickly, so buy yourself a $2.00 cloth that you can keep forever and clean them with this..problem solved really.<br />So that's about it. I keep the clear in the side cover storage in the event I get caught after dark, and ride with the amber/grey depending on my mood.  they are worth getting in my opinion. They seal well enough, are clear and do the job. I had no issues with fogging but it may be the wrong time of year for that. I live in NY,<br /><br />So why 4 and not 5 stars? I dunno... maybe cause out there somewhere there is a perfect pair of Oakleys for $300...  lol<br /><br />Safe riding all :)
B00V9QL7F6|4|Perfect, if maybe a little overpriced.
B00A8OI46K|5|Great quality and sturdy build. Looks great!
B00JVIIMGG|5|I absolutely love this car decal!!!  It was easy to apply.
B000ZJN7U6|5|very pretty really like it was just what I wanted thanks
B002ZTK7MK|1|Recommended vendor.  Arrived quickly and exactly as described.
B001AJKRNA|5|I have a 05 Dodge Ram and these fit perfectly. Once they are on, they are very stable.  I have no problems seeing to the rear and vibrations are not a problem for me.  These look very good and are as close to factory as you can get. I would bye these again and recommend them to anyone.
B004RCP3QS|3|Has like a LED in the front, very annoying.<br />Its mounted on the inside of my vehicle, and I think its already busted. I use this to maintain my starter battery on my RV. And I got another one 5W from a diffrent company to maintain my chassis batteries.
B0031GR4LI|5|Good quality for half the price.  Beware that they redisgned this part and will require thread in sensors instead of the original clip in.
B0041CDUM8|5|Installed this on my 2006 FZ1N and could not be happier. The exhaust is visually subtle and refined, several shades of black are used in place of the traditional Two Brothers yellow highlights with an intricate alternating carbon fiber weave design adding some visual complexity. The exhaust bracket is the same one used by most Two Brothers exhausts, consisting of a polished aluminum clamp with a rubber liner. Personally I feel an all black clamp would have matched the exhaust better, as is it does not detract from the aesthetic appeal of the muffler.   Fitment was excellent and the installation was simple; However, the slip on section of the new intermediate pipe to the OEM collector was extremely tight on my example and required a liberal amount of sanding on the collector/header side to fit completely, that said the connection is leak free.  The sound the muffler produces is a pleasing loud deep pulsing rumble with some drone at cruising speeds. Again this muffler is loud in stock form, so if you live in suburbia and like staying on good terms with the neighbors adding a power tip would be advised.  I personally added a P1-X power tip after a month of ownership and noticed a significant reduction in highway drone but also a loss in some of the deep characteristic rumble at idle (Luckily it only takes a few minutes and a single torx wrench to swap out power tips). Also, if you're not a fan of spectacular flames shooting out of this exhaust on deceleration smog block off plates would be a wise modification, otherwise enjoy the fireworks!   I highly recommend this extremely light and well built exhaust to any second gen FZ1 owner to eliminate the catalyzed monstrosity of a muffler that plagues the bike in stock form.
B00GTVNJD4|1|Oh yeah? Well I guess you'll have to find out the hard way.
B0016OMR96|3|It's a great summer jacket.. Much breathable than expected.. The only issue I have is that the shoulder pads will not stay on the shoulder where they belong. They always end up on my bicep. Not a preferred place for a shoulder pad.and Joe Rocket customer help has been worthless and no help so far.. After many e-mails back and fourth they have not contacted me back in over 16 days and this started a month ago.  Be careful on the size chart.. It must be not sized as the atomic 4.0 jackets..
B00RH3AMIS|5|All is good
B008BRJ5JG|5|Bought these as spares to my current bulbs. Mine run whenever the car is on so figuring after two years, they should be coming due soon to be replaced.
B007RECTEW|2|Shoulda bought a factory part. Doesn't fit right. Large gap between grille and edge. Couldn't get factory mounting holes to line up. Used tek screws to hold it on. Will buy one from Toyota to replace. Wish I would have checked fit before painting.
B00877SL2M|5|I always keep a bunch on hand for whenever.  I've swapped out all my dash and instrument lights out to these.
B000GU5IUQ|4|As described
B0002X520S|5|Worked well in New England weather on the construction site or out in the rough.
B00UFQVCMO|5|Perfect fit for Macan.  Outer side is silvery foil material, and the inner side is dark felt.  Very thick and sturdy, folds easily and nicely.  Slides fine into included storage bag with velcro flap.<br /><br />Almost the same price as OEM, but high quality without the obnoxiously large logo.
B004W1L4M6|5|had to buy this because i broke mine while rebuilding my engine rookie mistake. Can't beat the price. it has a solid build and has been working for a few months with no issue.<br /><br />  2000 honda accord coup lx 4cl
B00HUKA5DA|5|Good looking emblem. My looks good and doesn't have any kind of issues invloving the paint inside the lettering. Needed to be bent very slightly to fit properly on my vehicle.
B000IYJSF6|5|Good!
B00BFDGROO|1|Worked for 1 day.
B000AA8G5G|5|Seems to work well.
B000CJB1B6|5|After isntalled it works just perfectly<br />Ice cold<br />Fast shipping
B000CGMQB8|5|perfect fit, good quality, fair price
B008G231G4|5|Perfect !
B00BYH6C1E|5|Ended up getting these at OFive Depot on sale. My interior is grey so they're practically invisible, you only price them making noise when you adjust the seat and when you drop something and it saves the day.
B00ZRX4S08|5|Perfect
B00076QA4C|1|The adhesive pads needed for installation didn't stick at all to the surfaces of my GMC Yukon, and the alternative installation method requires drilling holes into the vehicle interior.  I'm not willing to do irreparable damage to my car for the sake of this netting.  I returned it due to the poor quality of the parts (i.e., the lame adhesive pads).  One could probably try a 3rd party adhesive, but I didn't want to destroy the product trying, and then not be able to return it.
B000ML8WQG|1|Caliper bolt screw are longer than the original bolt screw was not able to use it
B005345F80|5|good product
B009EVOMZA|3|Installed okay, but I had to remove the rear seat in my 97 Wrangler permanently to use it.  Not a huge deal, but if I wanted to remove the rear seat I would have bought a larger &#34;trunk&#34;.  Now I have to figure out some kind of modification to move the seat brackets forward so I can put the seat back in...ridiculous.<br /><br />It's supposed to work WITH the seat, not in SPITE of it.
B00VA5N26S|5|5 star
B001JTAM22|1|Wasn't even the correct one, the one I received was black and white, not black and carbon fiber.
B0010E1M02|5|easy install. just what i needed for my corolla 2007
B007RE2SZC|5|Excellent Service! On-Time Delivery. Item is as described! 5 Stars
B00CFCI99K|4|I didn't have any issues with the &#34;strong plastic smell.&#34;<br /><br />Fit well in my 2010 Nissan Altima. I did have to cut a hole in it so that I could use the hooks at the base of the car.
B00GXS3726|5|Excellent product, packaging was top notch also. Easy to follow instructions and well constructed materials used.I will recommend it to anyone.
B009EU5ZMA|5|It's J-B Weld, works as it should and easy to use. The syringe applicator makes it easy to get the right mix.
B00IZP4DZU|5|As described, very fast shipping from CA, easy installation and looks great on my Lexus GX 460. Saved over $100 in dealer fees installing it myself.
B000BVRZ74|5|Use this on shower glass works well, open all your windows before you use. Spray into rag or applicatio to lower the level of product you breath when applying. No smell after product dries 12-48 hrs
B001BFO5S6|5|Direct fit for original part.  Basically identical.  Disassembling the BMW door is a challenge, but well worth the efforts to have a locking door again.  When you do this job, consider replacing the plastic window guides at the same time.
B0016680T0|5|I was disappointed that I didn't check the online chart, on how much I would need for my motorcycle tire size, before ordering. It showed that I needed a little more than 8 oz. However, I followed the instructions and emptied the entire 8 oz bottle into my tire and added some air. I rode for about a mile and checked it again. It appeared that my tire was still leaking air and spitting the product out a little. I rode another mile and returned to find that it was no longer leaking. I then filled my tire to the correct psi. About a month, and hundreds of miles later... my tire has not lost one bit of air. Great product!
B008QXZ55S|5|Perfect
B00P3U2NIO|5|Had to use a frame to attach plate.
B004ZF31PC|2|Did not work correctly.
B004X5QYAI|5|perfect fit
B00931JXM8|1|Had a blemish in handle.
B000JWM9F8|1|Wasn't strong enough for the trailer I put it on.
B000EDOSS8|5|Seem to work well so far.
B000BSY9JE|5|Excellent seller recommend
B003I3NU0I|5|Easy install! Job complete in 30 minutes. The brackets were off but managed to bend them to get the tips centered. Sounds great for a 6 cylinder. No matter what muffler you put on a V6, you will never get that V8 rumble, but at idle its hard to tell the difference with the Gibson Exhaust. It also looks very nice with the larger tips.  Update; after about 500 miles the sound has gotten deeper!
B001GC2LVM|5|These worked great for leveling my trailer.
B00DSD6Z8W|2|Quality of product was not up to expectations. Poor color and detail. Not worth the money.
B009RU0G9O|5|Works great. Fit my 2014 Camaro just right. Very pleased.
B00GSAUHB8|5|The sun shade works perfect for me! I was concerned it wouldn't be long enough but if anything it's too long which is okay. If I needed another one, I would buy again!!
B000CRO4IK|3|While this product gets the job done, it could be of better quality. The only way coins don't fall out of the slots is if they're packed really full. It fits well in a cupholder, but coins fall out on bumpy roads.
B0055QOKC8|5|Works great, use it all the time!
B008FCE6KK|5|Pretty simple install. Quick shipping and works great so far with my Thule cargo carrier.
B00CZBQCR2|5|Good, Good, Good, Only if you know what your doing. Many unskilled people blamed this product for their own shot comings and inconsistencies. Items are not to be installed by you if you are a dentist or hair stylist.... Ha.... Ha..... Leo
B000XRHRZQ|4|great price for hubcaps, almost identical to 2007 toyota corolla (without the toyota logo in center).  they fit pretty well, almost flush...but its a great price.
B00S8F3S1C|5|easy to put on, looks sharp! Glad it came in a round tube, so they didn't get kinks in the mail!
B00282YGGM|4|First one arrived broken. The replacement worked fine
B00K2DJGOQ|5|great product fits perfectly
B003UXUGUI|5|while the boot pockets could hah been bigger this an awesome gag main compartment is huge fit 2 sets of gear and deep enough to leave gopro on helmets
B00ZSM6BEE|5|These fit very easily into my 2005 Mazda 6. The color in the photo on my computer was true to the real color. I set the mats outside for two days before putting them in the car so there is not any smell. They stay in place and do what mats are supposed to do. I would note that a Mazda 6 is a small to mid-size car. No complaints.
B00FHSHUEO|5|Arrived on time, looks great, just as expected. Sizing chart helped.
B009OOQJ5S|5|Perfect, just what we needed.
B00TKNOP68|5|Resmbels factory lights.  Easy to install.  Works great.  Provides lots of light for my RV entryway.
B00JHEG7UW|5|Works good
B0075JYPNM|5|Easy to apply, great size, durable material... I love it!
B00K53CLKE|4|Extremely small. I expected it to be much larger but to my pleasant surprise it was quite small but still hold the 12.9 vults needed to pwer my lawn mower or atv. Good buy.
B000OZTPKC|5|Seat covers are perfect. They fit nicely and are durable. You cant beat the price either.
B005DH1FUE|2|sin coment
B000W0MOD4|5|Nice product. Delivered fast. Great value. A+++++
B007VRE72M|4|Threads could have been tapped a little deeper for drain plug, but still works ok.
B00AM1Z67O|5|Nice that it comes in a 5 quart container.  Just enough for my Mazda B3000 3.0L engine (same as Ford Ranger).
B00413R1KO|5|excellent quality and just what I needed
B00G620ZVU|4|Great value
B004MNOJTY|5|great match to the factory color
B00VS02PUE|5|Just put these downpipes on my 135i sound great! And fit great!
B000BXOGNI|5|Great cleaner.
B008XUN02O|1|For $239 these Chima made gloves are not worth it my opinion. The cheap plastic around the wrist is what got me to return these. For $249 I ended up buying the Scorpion Clutch gloves that have proved to be far more superior than these GP Pro's
B00COOSGBU|5|Received my package months ago, everything came in order and was received in a timely fashion. just installed the lights myself this week in my 2013 Kia Optima  and they look awesome! The dispersal pattern is way better than the old halogen bulbs. Will keep updated about status of bulbs.
B002PLHBOK|5|Works
B001K2Q23G|5|I've used these on both my SUVs for years to protect from heat and high altitude sun.  On my previous car the clearcoat disintegrated from UV and it looked junky, and would have cost hundreds of dollars to buff off and redo.  After trying regular cloth covers, which did not hold up, I've started using these, which last for many years.  When it is windy I use spring clips on the mud flaps to hold it down.  A slight breeze will lift it off the car an inch or so and blow the heat out from between the car and the cover, leaving the surface of the car and interior remarkably cool.  Even without air movement, the surface of the car is at least 20 degrees cooler.
B00IS941D2|5|Great packaging! Looks awesome!
B001VG0AUC|5|great price fast shipping love the sound
B00ZHORALG|3|Consider getting these thicker o-rings for your repairs. Most of you will not think of it, but this size should be adequate enough for all of your watches. A search for these will usually bring up the small diameter and if you're into that, then go for it. READ THE REVIEWS
B0087JAQZA|5|just as claim !! great product! My cobra now turns in style !!
B007N6YSCU|5|The strut arrived as advertised and even with only one strut, it holds the tailgate glass easily. However, we'll see what happens once winter comes....
B0068FVTPG|5|Best quick was on the market!!<br />Use on the boat, jet ski, classic car, etc.....
B00C9T41F0|5|Perfect fit, works like a charm. Thanks.
B002OAOAY6|5|Excellent sound and volume quality, CD player is very forgiving on bumps, I purchased XM/Sirrus tuner and antenna kit, the satellite radio ROCKS!! as long as you maintain clear line of sight with sky. My favorite surprise after installation was the difference in the way my Road King handles now!! No longer hitting the wind with my larger windshield (sail), instead, I have become extremely aerodynamic!! I had no idea of the improved handing I was going to get! Very well made, quality product, Hoppe - thank you!!
B00JOY6U7U|4|No complaints, works fine for my application
B00COYNZJ8|5|Mine works fine. Hasn't melted. And I live in South Texas. It's  fine. And super cool.
B00066UKM6|5|FIVE START
B000C53XMK|2|2 stars only because the shocks worked after I used correct size air lines and fittings. Don't know about durability yet. Shocks were black (not like the picture and looked more like old version of Gabriel hijack). {Maybe the seller was mis-informed by their supplier about these shocks, benefit of doubt I wanted the white coloring to contrast on a 1999 EZ-GO TXT golf cart. Which btw did fit nicely in which is other reason for 2nd star. Very faint sign of a second X in word of Max on a couple of shocks (reminds me of a Chinese knockoff version). Air line kits didn't fit shocks, were very loose going into shocks. Had to use my own air line and fittings. Mixed dates between shocks and the manuals: Oldest date was in 2008 and ranging to newest date 2016. Would I order this again? Only if price for 2 sets are $40 cheaper than the white Monroe Air-Max MA705 shocks.
B001KPJDMU|5|Getting my truck back on the road...now I can see out of the rear windshield when it rains.
B00SIKVBBQ|1|worked for a couple of days and then stopped.
B000C9DBKK|5|This service line was an exact fit. I was able to install it in place of the original one with no problems or modifications at all. It also arrived with its own orifice tube already installed.
B00SFSQ21K|5|Bought JDM switchbacks first but they were like 3.5 inches long!! These one's are 2.32 inches long and BARELY fit in the front turn signal housing of my 2010 mazda 3 hatch. Damn they are super bright though!
B006E3SJZA|5|Ive bought these before and they are still really good leds.
B00WPW6BAE|5|Plug and play - saves time, money and trouble
B00KBINF7G|4|This unit works good and my wife was camping and was able to keep all her electronic gear charged with this unit and it recharges quite fast I recommend it.
B00FS2TL8C|5|Nice piece
B009455Y8K|5|Very happy with the service and product. Easy installation and works well.
B00651CACY|5|I have been using for about a month now it works perfect even under tunnels and I can get all radio stations clearly even far away stations. The wind flexes it when moving fast but straightens back out when you slow down or stop. Short height is great for off-road as it won't bang around from trees or bushes.
B006M8KNEC|5|Fits perfectly...
B00I8T9SLW|5|Perfect fit .
B001KOIRTG|3|The parts were fine, but there were no installation instructions. After removing the snap ring, the spring ejected the remaining parts and I had to guess at how and in what order to install the new parts. Brakes work, so I guess I guessed correctly.
B005CLMEHE|5|Perfect fit. 5 min to install.
B00S5TBP4I|3|Not what was expecting. This product is huge and will need to be cut down. It has a lot of folds so it doesn't go up and down quickly.
B007XP0RTY|5|Excellent.
B000S374XU|5|perfect fit
B0012ZEZ8A|5|great products
B003M10WLG|1|bad product does not fit my Mazda 3
B0002SQYV4|5|As a hobby detailer, I find Meguiars' products to be the best value on the market.  Are there better products to be found? Yes, and if you're entering your car in a car show, you may consider something of the highest quality.  For those who want their car to be clean and protected and to look nice, this is a great product.  This leaves a low-gloss sheen, which I prefer, leaving a very clean look on the interior of the car.  Also, it does not leave a greasy residue.  I use it on all interior rubber, vinyl, and plastic in the car and I love it.  Has a nice smell to it also, and a little goes a long way.
B0000AZ77J|5|Small bathroom in the RV, this offers a great way to stand up.
B000CFMDJO|5|works just fine
B009ZLQ1X0|5|Perfect fit!
B0041PUPN2|5|Easy install; just handed the parts to my tech and drink a cup of joe and check out the new bikes. My 07VTX1300c has Hondaline aux headlights and shield. He had to go inside headlight to get some slack for sure harness to tie wrap to original connector. Right side harness and break line will not reach original tie wrap connector, but looks ok and no rubbing on tank. Clutch and throttle cables a bit tight on full lock, but they do not bind and mine have a bit longer route to go over light bar mount. I hoped these would eliminate idle back ache completely withy new ultimate solo seat, but not quite. It is improved though. I hope I will get use to it with time. Pearl white V looks great with the seat and no backrest and tank/fender bibs.  Hoping to avoid buying a back rest.
B000VKTULY|5|Easy to install.  Watch a YouTube video, follow the enclosed instructions and save some money.
B00OBZ9H4A|5|High quality, quick delivery.
B000BZ93SO|5|Good.
B00MGE5T04|5|This shirt is good quality and a great price.  It delivered to my house much quicker than I had anticipated.  He loves it so much, he doesn't want to get it dirty riding!<br /><br />Thank you!!!
B004N6PNX6|5|fog lamps where a perfect match
B00M7M4GLI|1|I have tested this on my NEXUS 6 ,SAMSUNG galaxy S6 and my IPHONE 6 on all ports showing maximum output of 1.3 amps on all ports with 3.88 to 4 voltage! it got me scratching my head so I decided to try it in a different car, mind you both are 2015 cars!!! with same results.<br />I thought maybe I got a faulty one and to be fair I wanted to give OMAKER witch is the manufacture a chance to fix the problem before I write a review.<br />I waited about a day to hear from them and here is there response<br /><br />(manufactures email to me)<br />Sorry to hear that the charger did not meet your satisfaction and we do apologize for any inconvenience caused to you.<br />But you have to understand that this charger does not support fast charging.There are all sorts of chargers with different functions, not all of them support fast charging.<br /><br />here is what I wrote back<br />Fast charging??? You have this charger advertised on Amazon.com<br />Having 3 ports<br />#1 port 2.1amp<br />#2 port  2.0 amp<br />#3 port  1.0 amps<br />I'm telling you it's not charging at the advertised rate all the ports are charging at 1.3 amps max and 4 volts I also told you I tested on different phones. So yes please replace this faulty charger or refund the money back.<br /><br />Its been 3 days now and I still have not heard from them, It amazes me how can they advertise this being 26w with 5.1 when in reality its<br />12W with 3.9A to the folks that dont know what amps and voltages are in simple terms it will charge your devices very slowly!<br />this is all my opinion and experience its up to you how you use the information but if I was in your shoes i would second guess my purchase from them and look for other great companies on amazon.com that do stand behind there product rather then insult you as the consumer.<br />Before I forget to those who would like to do a test themselfs you can use a little program Geekbench3 on marketplace and appstore.
B007W60I9S|3|The starter works great.  I don't think I really needed it, I just needed to charge my battery.  The problem with this starter is that it sticks.  It physically sticks and I have to take the cover off and tap the rotation mechanism to start the engine.  No lube will solve this.  Once I installed it and &#34;knocked the paint off', I wasn't going to try to send it back.  I wouldn't recommend this starter.
B00HG2214I|5|It was deliver it sooner than was expected, the quality of the welds with excellent, perfect fit
B00BZSE5CK|5|Goes on very easy and great quality..
B000C9M4MQ|5|So far so good couple hundred miles totally quite not like the DWK7400 that were installed a year ago that were looser and noisier than 100,000 mile oem and no one could (would) admit they were bad from day one. The only thing I don't like is I wonder how long the wire wraps that hold the boots sealed will last in the salty winters.
B005CLMQJ0|5|Worked out great
B00NFJP8E6|5|perfect fit
B009DK3RR6|5|It fits perfectly on our 2007 Ford Fusion.
B000CN7IYQ|5|Be fit just right
B007DKQ7YI|5|Fit perfect and works the way it should have. Thank You
B000W0KTKY|2|it may resist an intent to force it open, life expectancy though: 14 months,quality according to the price. after that don't throw it away, good, heavy solid chunk of steel good to deterr an intent of robbery, as IDW (improvised defensive weapon).
B00HNP91VO|5|great light
B00KWNSE6M|5|exactly what we wanted, could not ask for better fit
B0018JXFA4|1|Amazon says it fits my 2002 Lexus IS 300, but the plug is different.  All the work for nothing.  Never buy auto parts from Amazon again.
B002YKBPXA|5|I have not had to check my tires yet but it's on my nightstand in case I ever do. I'm confident it will do the job.
B0040DVL6U|5|works very well. Make sure you measure the distance available between the sun visors so  there is no collision!
B008OXJIGW|5|I hope I never need it.Nice case.You won't be rebuilding an engine with this,but you might make it home.
B0000AY3X0|5|Will order again very good quality.
B000C7UQRI|2|Exact oe replacement without the price of a car dealership. Switch quit working after 2 months.
B00X96UT08|4|Good product for the price. I'm still trying to figure out where all the bulbs provided go. Came w very minimal instructions. Certainly nothing about figment areas provided. Thank goodness several are obvious. Shipping was very quick. I would purchase again from this seller.
B008720YYA|5|Replaced original powerboard with this and it works great!! FICM is back to 48.5 - 49.5 at all times
B006X8C75Y|2|Did not fit!
B00KDLN0JY|5|Looks as seen in picture very durable steel hitch however it is only a few inches long so beware.
B000FLLWGA|5|Exact replacement in our 2011 Montana Mountaineer. Hard wired in. Removed drawers, cut existing wires, rewired and used old mounting bracket. 30 minute job. Manufactured date of June 2015.  Very happy.
B000FDWIY8|4|Very good quality car cover. Very happy with it.
B000UX3Z3G|5|As described, quick delivery.
B007V2C0US|5|Gorgeous for our new brown truck.  Only gold one I've ever seen.  Best quality I've seen, too.  Very heavy and well constructed.
B00ZM9LANA|5|I think my daughter loves this more than I do. She loves how she can store her things away without having to your her things back and forth because I don't allow things to just be left in the car. But now that she has somewhere to put her things away at I have lightened up a bit. This product is of very good quality and I predict that I will have it for quite some time.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW
B004TRKBOK|4|Simple design. We put one in each car. Seems like it will do the job. I will review again once i visit a junkyard and try it out on a window and seat belt.
B00FP0G5EK|5|Fixed the problem with the hid kit flickering and sometimes one light wouldn't stay on and both lights are even brighter with this kit
B007TO3Z02|5|Stuff is awesome. Look out I'm dipping everything! Buy by the the case the only way to go.
B00GHT6SF4|5|Worked out great installed less10 minutes
B000BPQGRA|5|Can't say I noticed any performance increase or fuel economy....But the these plugs have not fouled out on my BB 460 yet like other brands did.
B006TZR8L4|1|Item description is different than when bought. Description stated plugs..as in plural..I would never buy a 6 dollar stinking plug, especially when these run 1-2 dollars a piece. I bought these expecting a 4 pack...especially considering I just went to AutoZone and got 4 pack of this exact plug for the same price I am really annoyed I now have to wait another week to get on the road.
B00E0S6RUU|5|Perfect fit
B002SW4VLW|3|Won't take a charge anymore after 2-3 years.
B000CMD6WU|4|The adapter part was not needed for my purposes but did fit after i measured and cut the stud. I bought a stud that was supposed to fit my 79 corvette but was not only too long, it also had a smooth middle which when cut could not thread into my carb or screw onto a wing nut with the smooth end. This stud is threaded all the way and fit no matter how you cut it.
B00EVPMYW2|5|This is the ONlY torsion bar tool to buy for the new GM vehicles
B000E2CVEM|5|For the record the K&N 153 fits the 2015 Ducati Scrambler.  Amazon and K&N's website have it wrong as well as the local autoparts store.  So for those of you who own a Ducati Scrambler as I do, this is the correct filter.  The 2015 Ducati Scrambler's engine is from the 2014 Monster 796.  I use K&N filters on everything I own.  Can't go wrong with K&N. As other Ducati owners have mentioned hand tightening the filter may result in leaks, so I did another quarter turn just in case and have had no leaks. And the nut on the end of the K&N filter will save you much frustration and cursing.  Hope this helps!
B00529K65S|5|Fit great after I opened the retainer holes on the driver's side slightly. Look great, feel great, seem to be wearing well, allow easy access to pedals and gas cover lever.
B008SMIAAE|5|Arrived 2 days before estimated delivery date. Hook up was easy and simple once I planned it out. Probably the brightest set of LEDs I've ever had on a vehicle of mine. Absolutely love them
B00Y4GWVFI|1|Rip off! beware!!
B00KTI8UBE|3|Remote controls sync with vehicle fine. One of the remote controls does not currently work.
B0002UHVI2|5|Arrived as expected.  Packaging was good!
B002MGUO7Y|5|This worked perfectly for my mother with multiple sclerosis who is in a power chair. It was easy and quick to install, and it held the weight of her (150) and the power chair (250) with no problem. The best part is that there are side rails to the wheelchair or scooter can not fall of the sides. This is a huge necessity.
B00DDY399O|5|The petcock I received works perfect. Wait time was reasonable. Always have good results when I deal with Amazon. Thanks
B00Q34AJ0S|2|Very difficult to get on steering wheel. It had a strong leather/gasoline smell that stayed on my hands for weeks. Months later, though, its working or great.
B004TUDIEW|5|Fit perfect
B00G4L1T8Q|5|AAAAAAA++++++
B00U7U03ZK|5|Very good quality.  easy install, absolutely no issues whatsoever.
B003BYFT9O|5|Coin holders are useless but other than that is great. I'm not a meter maid,  I don't keep that much change in my car.
B000TYSBYY|5|very good
B00DQJ9GWU|5|Works great and now no more worries going through the car wash!
B000FOXOWW|1|The aerator timer that I need to replace, is the same one that is pictured. It fits perfectly in the exsisting switch panel in my boat. The aerator I recieved was a bit different than the pictured item. It is wider in the back, so it won't fit in my switch panel. I'm sure it will work just fine, I just need to mount it in another location. A little more work than the plug and play result I was hoping for..
B00OH0S5Y2|4|For the money, these are great!  I ordered them to replace the license plate, reading light and door illumination lights on my 2014 Accord, and what a difference!  As other reviewers have said, they can be a little tricky to install, but easily corrected.  1) Make sure they'll actually fit - they're longer than the standard bulbs;  2) DON'T unplug the old bulbs when they're hot (DUH!); 3) Make sure the contact pins are straight and not &#34;squished&#34; down - they need to be sticking up a little to make good contact; 4) Make sure they're oriented correctly.  If you put them in the wrong way, they won't work - So, just turn them 180 degrees and try again.  That's all there is to it!  One minor thing is that they have the LED slight yellow tinge on the fringes, but you don't really notice it unless you look carefully.
B00CC4LX2G|3|one of the bulbs was broken in each package
B00KN0UOEE|4|Goes on easy.  Has a matte, not flat, finish.  Works as advertised, I guess.<br /><br />But, doesn't hold up very well to rain or moisture.  For instance, on the interior of my 4Runner.  I will often rest my arm or elbow on the console or door side.  The product is quickly gone from those areas.  It looks a bit odd to have 95% of something covered with the product and have a spot where there is none, just from my arm resting on it.  I would like for it to be more durable.  And, on the outside of the vehicle, I put the product on the plastic wheel flares of the 4Runner.  It looks good until I drive it in the rain.  The product is then pretty much washed off.  Again, I would have liked for it to have been more durable, because I am not going to go to the trouble to detail the car with that much care each time I wash it.  Which means the product has limited use to me.  Why put it on my tires (which I didn't do) if it washes of easier than the $3.00 a bottle tire shine?  There might be a small benefit if it doesn't wipe off tires and leave your hands or clothes black, but I don't touch my tires with my hands or clothes aside from cleaning the car, so that benefit doesn't matter to me.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being unreasonable.  Just expected more from a product that was so expensive.
B0041TQS5M|4|Fit perfectly. Seem to be a little thinner than the factory filter paper, but seem to be working OK otherwise.
B0081SCV14|5|Excellent
B00WJOG4BO|1|Product does not fit the Jeep that it says it will.  Pieces were too big and adhesive did not stick.
B005737RB0|5|Good value; appears to be well made.  My husband wears extra tall sleeves and torso and surprisjngly this jacket accommodates him.  Very pleased.
B001C8YSWK|3|they're ok a little pricey installed them on the rear of my wrangler along with yellow stuff pads didn't notice any better braking compared to factory<br />brake pads.
B001MX2BBK|5|fit great and looks great
B004WLM3PS|4|Oversized, ended up returning.
B0040CRRRI|5|Worked great on 2006 H3 Hummer fender well area.
B006X8BATI|5|LOVE IT
B00NRBJPLO|5|Love it! Thank you!!! A+++
B000BGOFL8|4|the car connector is black blastic (not like the pic)
B001AXBI3Y|5|put these on my dual exaust that has no cat just straighted pipe (z71 350).. sounds awesome not crazy lound but when you step on it they have that rumble popping tone. will be buying again when they go bad. highly recomend
B00ZR7WLEE|5|Bought these to retrofit existing travel trailer incandescent fixtures.  Very bright, and nice warm white light. I also like the separate switch per side.
B00BZO4P1K|5|Looks great will give it 5 stars.  Will be back later with another update if they don't hold up.  So if you don't see an update from me then they are good to purchase.
B00449KPXK|5|Perfect fit. showed up on time.
B00JKU60J6|5|Great sticker.
B00EVZ8SCM|3|Decent but you will wish you bought a royal wheel looks and feels legit just leather is glued in some places will not last.
B004GL8YB6|5|husband is very happy with this product.  Thinks the lights are great.
B00JJ6UIR6|5|Nice
B00BAYR4AY|4|very very bright!
B005MDSWCS|5|Great fit! I can save on filters.
B000BWEH6K|2|Cling-on was for inside a clear window facing out, would not work for vehicle window.  Windows are tinted and would not allow decal to be seen outside of the vehicle. I wanted a decal for the outside of the vehicle rear window.
B0024E6UE0|5|The screens fit just wright, stops the bugs from getting in.
B00P1F6A94|5|Excellent
B005G8DBOS|5|Looks great and proud to put it on my jeep. Hope sticker will last more than A year but over all love it.
B000ZAVV26|5|Fits my 2014 FJ perfect
B001LHVOVK|5|Great product to have
B00BPEHOM2|5|Fit perfectly.  Make sure to get the one piece version.
B0054YCW62|3|The net is great, the plastic hooks aren't great. I haven't had any break but they bend and get out of shape. I'm trying to find a better hook system. Still not a bad deal.
B000JFHNG0|5|Works as advertised.
B0023UPPL4|5|My truck camper came with a tiny sewer hose storage that was nearly useless. Also it wouldn't hold my Camco fittings. I was tired of stuffing my extension hose and fittings in a bag and taking up half of my storage compartment.<br /><br />I bought this and using two large heavy duty zip ties on each end, I mounted it to my rear camper ladder. It holds my entire sewer hose and my Camco fittings perfectly. As others have said, initially my Camco fittings wouldn't quite fit into the tube because of the 4 overly big tabs that are around the outside of the Camco (used to grip when twisting together etc).  But that was a very simple fix. I simply filed a tiny amount off the tabs. I took maybe 1/16&#34; off each, as it didn't take much and left plenty of tab left to still use for grip etc. I used a sander to quickly take the tiny amount off I needed, but a file or a dremil would work just as well. Once done, all couplings and the hose and ends slipped up into the container just fine. The cap twists and locks into the bottom (and top, but I just use the bottom one).  Drove over 3k miles to several campgrounds and never had any issue with this and I now have my precious storage compartment available for other stuff.<br /><br />This was a great buy, works great, and I am very happy. It's light enough to keep weight down due to not being a thick pvc tube but is plenty strong to do the job!
B009DJQWU6|5|Love the look of it on my SUV. Fit perfect.
B000CIQ5E0|5|It was what I was looking for
B000W0RQ8C|5|Works great and you can hardly see it.
B00W6IZRR0|5|They were a gift for my daughter in law and she loved them.
B00R7GW6H0|5|I bought a new car a few months ago and got this to put in one of the middle console cup holders.  Fits well and is very useful and handy for small stuff like gum wrappers, Kleenex etc.
B00BRP3J5A|5|Love it!! It helps me find my car in the parking lot.
B00KM6OY9A|5|High quality, no stiffness.  Easy to handle.
B000EY5OSK|5|good stuff
B00QPQD1NQ|5|Works great, small, light and powerful. Works for so many things! Handy to hold in your pocket. Can work and charge so many things. Quick charge time too! Case fits everything!
B00MOR4D5U|5|So much brighter than stock headlights, easy to install, fast shipping!
B004JBJWJQ|4|Works but I purchased the wrong one. There are two different models made for the chevy cruze. All I did was swap the motor assembly and it works like it's new!
B000ZN047G|1|Bought this one from amazon, new unit was 4x louder than OEM pump.  Sending unit failed at 15 months (~10k miles), pump failed at 18, warranty denied by airtex.  New fuel filter installed with it as well.  2001 Yukon OEM ACDELCO pump lasted 165k miles and probably only died due to a clogged fuel filter.
B0041PZXS4|4|Worked great on our jetski
B00ON7K48O|5|Strata is an amazing product. It out-performs the competitive sealants in this space and is very easy to use. Migliore keeps their product quality very high, and the results show.<br /><br />This is a photo of one of my client's cars, after correction and Strata. It looks great months later, as advertised. People cannot believe the depth of the shine. It borders on the depth you see in Modesta (at 10x the cost).<br /><br />Highly recommend! We have made it a staple for our detail clients.<br /><br />Edit - added some additional images (no filters) of a few other vehicles we have done. The repeated results are great. We have a customer who has tracked their car regularly and it held up to that as well.
B00W6IYYKQ|4|Fit the Nissan Titan crew cab very well
B0040QWADU|5|Perfect exactly as described will order in the future
B00XZ9PFI0|1|This key would probably be great but I went to 4 different Automotive Lock Smiths and none of them would cut and program it so it is now just sitting on my table collecting dust and reminding me of a great thing that could have been.. Probably wouldn't bother me to much if they offered refunds on uncut keys.. Oh well it was a learning experience
B00RETZWQ2|4|very nice.
B00QGLHJ9W|1|They work.. As in they turn on when you click the blinker... But you will need a resistor so it will continuously blink and not just turn on like a light bulb
B0082OU772|5|Love it!!
B009YKVR18|4|MORE FOR LOOKS THAN IT IS PRACTICAL TO REMOVE YOUR TIRE VALVE STEMS. OTHERWISE; A GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE NISSAN ENTHUSIAST.
B00F21CK7I|5|Love it!
B00DBNL8SQ|5|the floor liners are quality,  I just sat them right on top of my reg floor mats & know they will be protected from dirt & stains & spills & these mats have no ODOR to annoy you.
B000C541K8|4|Just received this morning, box was Moog but part I received is different branding than the other Moog ES3558 Made in Japan. This one came with no castle nut or pin, instead came with a nylon locking nut and was branded CTR CENTRAL CORPORATION Made in Korea.
B01078GH6A|5|I love it. It is a good size and very well made. The strap is nice and long and easily shortened. I love the roll of bags that came with it..Even though the bags are not made to stick to the can itself, I don't find it a problem. I have needed a new one for some time and this is perfect.
B0040AE7WS|5|I thought they would be plastic, but was pleasantly surprised when I discovered they are actually metal.
B00RM327NG|2|Returned this devise as it did not meet my expectations.
B0071ICVY2|5|I bought this because I was looking for the best motorcycle branded SnapBack style hat and I'd say this was it and when I got it I found out it was made by the same company that makes Suburban Delinquent YouTube Motovlogger's hat (FlexFit) a real good brand
B000Y89T1E|4|Using this as part of my solar setup.  I've got relays running from each of switches so the switch controls the relay and the relay handles the real power to the devices.  The fuses in this unit are just a bonus to protect the relays.<br /><br />One star off because one of the fuse holders broke (and the fuses are spring loaded so it went flying) but was easily fixed with some super glue.
B00MH38P4Q|5|Fits perfectly. .<br />Instructions dead on. ..
B00JQIQ632|5|Perfect
B00K1C1WC2|1|Only received one.  Supposed to be two
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Love it!!!  Packs a wallop for such a small device!
B00FHSREB8|4|I had the Hellcat's before these - I had a bad crash and they were excellent.  Compared to the Hellcat these are better styled, but the denim is thinner. I didn't realize it when I ordered them that there is way less kevlar protection, hence I bought some Draggin kevlar liners. Despite the minor styling advantage I would spend the extra money and get the Hellcat if I were to do it over.
B0009JKIRC|5|I own 2 Gibsons guitars: a 2013 Les Paul Standard and a 2001 ES-335.  Both of these guitars are coated in nitrocellulose, a beautiful but somewhat temperamental finish (reacts with many chemicals). Nitrocellulose is only found on vintage and the most expensive guitars, and requires special treatment.  Many have said that Pledge furniture polish works wonders but this is a silicone containing product which is an absolute no-no for these guitars.  Many in the guitar community and professional luthiers swear by a product called virtuoso.  I agree it's a good product but ridiculously expensive.  Gibson sells a &#34;Pump Polish&#34; but really it's not a polish at all, but more of a cleaner only.<br /><br />I noticed that Zymol recently released a special guitar polish formula, and I went back to the boards to read about it and I discovered that many people have been using the car polish version with excellent results.  It is an all natural formula WITHOUT silicone. I tried it on a small area of my ES-335 and I was really impressed.  I ended up striping all the hardware and giving it a full polish up.  The guitar looks brand new!  It took some elbow grease but that's exactly what you want, something gentle to prevent you from overdoing it.  I believe this fits the bill perfectly. The best part is its relatively cheap compared with Virtuoso and Zymols dedicated guitar polish, which is most likely just a similar formula to his one.<br /><br />5 stars!  Great on guitars!
B000IOONEW|5|Fit perfectly, dont buy other aftermarket.
B00XP79T34|1|when they say you get what you pay for... this is worth less than you pay for! the product is really bad and when i say bad it is really really bad
B0039H66N6|1|There was only one in the box, the description says kit, and shows two. Wasted a lot of time on the phone to figure out.
B00JSJMV38|5|I love it.  Very good quality.  I first bought it for my husband.  Then I ordered one more to upgrade mine.
B005HWW6LW|2|There was nothing glossy about this wrap.
B004I0XI5W|3|This is almost a perfect replacement. Everything matches and the bulb holders and screw went in like a dream. On closer inspection the taillight slightly protrudes at the top. Not a perfect fit , the molding is not within OEM tolerance, or the accuracy is just not there. You can notice the difference when viewing from the side.
B011KCZAG0|1|Structurally sound… Letters are just stickers though. Not what I expected and already seem to be coming loose.
B003VDX5D2|4|me and the wife love this so much easier getting in and out.  the only thing is the picture shows  a square tube at bottom and mine is a flat bar
B00R0SBFV8|4|Great product. Works for 62 mm diameter wheels. Just be sure to measure the correct diameter in your wheels. This is not for 57mm wheels.
B005R4KUU4|5|Easy to install only thing is to make sure u get some smaller reverse light bulds
B00XHB6LDE|3|Installed these into a 2010 Nissan frontier. The the low beams were AMAZING, and super bright, without too much glare. The High-Beams were where the problem laid: they were useless. With these bulbs, the ground directly in front of my truck, and the treetops were lit up, but everything else was completely dark. I live in a VERY dark area and use my high beams ALOT so these were a safety issue, and I returned them. They would be great for someone living in the city where the only use for high beams is reminding other drivers that their high beams are on.
B00NFSNAS8|5|You get what you pay for and it couldn't be truer than in the case of this pump. Worth every penny.
B008TECLSI|2|Product works but is mislabeled.its hard to install on wide tires and on trucks. Other then that issue works great
B00D8DR0AO|5|This actually works.  Its great for when its brutally hot out and you want to wash the car in the garage.
B004HODQEW|2|I purchased this because I was rebuilding a 01 Kia Sportage and after the long process of finally getting everything back together , I have just found out the gas gage is not working and that the sending unit is the cause. We of course checked everything else.  I now am seeing I can't even get a replacement on the new part I paid for.  When working on a car in my spare time and didn't find out until 2months after I bought the part because of fitting in fixing it in between other work.  Being in the automotive business I know Auto 7 is a good name but may not buy on Amazon again.
B009FU6CEE|5|OEM part, fit great, easy install, quick shipping, good packaging. Would buy from this vendor again.
B001EOV45G|5|Perfext
B00108Q8L6|2|These were not at all as depicted.  Plush?!?  I don't think so.  They are flat and thin, and not at all what I expected, but they were (at least) tan. If I didn't need them, and was willing to take the hassle of returning them, I would.  So, I guess I'll just use them for a month until the wear through and get a better set next time.
B00HVHUX3O|3|Not satisfied with it
B002HRNP8S|3|holds my stuff but it doesn't hold it securely.  very floppy.
B003TSOYZW|5|Worked as advertised, though I'm not using it for the listed application, bought this to take the clutch apart on an '86 Honda Aero 50 scooter, so probably less torque involved than an axle nut, but I'm sure it's plenty beefy for that too.
B0016KG72I|5|VERY EASY TO INSTALL
B0028VYEEW|5|Excellent unit,working like a charm ( for now )
B010APNNAS|5|The 90 Degree Valve Stem Extension make it very easy to keep the rear tire on my motorcycle properly inflated. There is no better way to safe riding than to have properly inflated tires on any two wheeled vehicle.<br /><br />Kenny G
B002KR3NI2|5|good
B00RDE1JX8|4|Looks exactly like described. I like it.
B00O28W0L8|5|Fit as advertised and works well.
B00N08WHXM|1|wouldnt fit my bike like it said
B0075FU38W|5|I bought two because the originals had worn out.  I got them cut they work perfectly.
B00B9W4HGQ|5|I've tried many products for removing water stains in clear coats and windscreens/windows, and this product works the best....
B000RNU424|5|Best price for this class hitch. I have shopped around and found that this was totally a good buy!!! 1 year of real research!<br /><br />Pep Boys told me that this Reese Bar would require to relocate my tailpipe... and would cost over $230 for installation. I then waited over 8 Months before researching this item again. Spoke to a local mom and pop shop...(east end &#34;muffler&#34; in RVA) the cost was only $80 and required only moving the muffler down so the hitch could slide on and be bolted. So my lesson in all of this?<br /><br />Don't order steak from anywhere other then a steakhouse!
B00G620ZVU|5|These lights are great!! I have them on my 2015 Polaris rzr 900S I bolted then to the top of roll cage and use as back up lights. They are bright and everyone that has seen then want them. They've gotten wet about 6 or 7 times now and never fog up. Must by!
B00WFIJG3C|3|Had it on for about a month. There is very little change. Expected more out of it. By looks it just changes the temp reading going in to car. Cooler to get the performance. Good shipping on it though. Came when expected. Easy hook up.
B0062IJOJ2|5|Installed on a Ford E-250 van. Very sturdy and installed easily by drilling holes. Held 250 pound person.
B00BD6SGRY|5|Looks and fits great. Installed in five minutes. So much better than OEM plastic that broke after two removals.
B00VAKSWEU|5|Product is great and great shipping also. Thanks!
B000KYXD46|5|Works great. Didn't have too much trouble programming....saved a couple of hundred bucks off the price dealer was asking for keys and programming. What more can one ask?
B00SCXCQV8|5|Made well and easy hookup.
B00880D8YY|5|Loved it when I was going through the phase of wearing my keys on my belt. I've only stopped because I like to be quiet. My item did not have the two chinese characters depicted in the picture. It instead says gojinka, I assume is the manufacturer? I would take a picture, but I can't find it right now.
B00K0UKG68|5|Just finished installing this turbo. I will say that I'm amazed on the fit and finish on this turbo. I wasn't sure about the brand Stigan, but after the reviews on other models I decided to go with it. I glad I did everything fit as it should. This is a true bolt on turbo, no hacks or rigging needed.
B0052O8K7Y|4|Great
B003FBV8ZW|5|I ordered two sets of these!
B003TNHEO0|1|Very poor quality.
B00VW948TC|5|The chain ends work good, just what i wanted.
B004QMYZZ4|5|This replaced the 22 year old noisy fan motor in our Holiday Rambler Class A. It was a bit challenging to get the fan off the old motor, but it can all be done with patience. With this motor the furnace now runs quiet and strong. I almost suckered out for a new furnace, but am SO GLAD to have gone this route instead.
B0073WEZU4|5|Excellent product.  Took a little force to get fully and tightly installed (good grip strength is a must as I don't know if you'd want to take vice grips to this). Reception is excellent.  Audio quality is just as clear as OEM.  This product is much shorter than I expected - 3 inches maybe of some sort of cast metal (aluminum?)  Either way I bought this out of necessity fitting my truck into areas with lower clearance was beating up my old antennae pretty badly.  Excellent upgrade in function and aesthetics.
B000BWAPA2|5|Perfect fit!
B0002SRL20|3|Well built, but the gauge always reads 40lbs.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but it reads contrary to the other 3 gauges I have.
B00O2ROPYO|5|Looks good
B008VQKN9I|5|Well made very tough unit!
B00F7GYUOO|4|Decent quality for the price.
B00G0PQM60|5|Works fine for 2000 4-Runner.  Did remove old broken plastic gear strip from the motor which made installation a little more complicated.  Not clear whether it was necessary, but old coil did occupy space.
B00062ZDB8|5|Works as advertised
B00H6ETIWY|5|Put these on my Kubota RTV, and they look great!  The roll bar clamps were to small, but it was my fault for ordering the wrong size.  Was able to make it work with extra clamps I had, but the mirrors look clean, and are bigger than other mirrors on the market.
B0066IUPH8|5|Works great.
B004S3I8S6|5|As always the part was perfect
B00ASY7HI6|5|Fits my 2010 Wrangler Sahara perfectly. It stays in place because of the hook in the mat and nibbed back. Had coffee spilled on the floor and the mat contained the mess very well. Mat is also easy to clean with water and garden hose.
B00407YPKA|5|This paint works real good and I got it real fast.
B0010GO0G8|5|Right part
B00CR9WWN0|5|Fit perfect in my 2015 mk7 gti, don't know of any additional benefits, I installed it the second day after I bought my car
B004IH7N1K|5|fast shipping and quality is great
B005FKUULO|5|Nice product fit perfectly.
B001V8U12M|5|The right size to attach to drill for easy up and down of the leveling jacks.
B00T3MA736|3|be careful in my book it shows this number should be 2 drilled sides and 2 tapped sides.. this bearing is all 4 drilled
B0023VIJUW|5|Great Replacement Headlight assembly for my 2007 Town And Country LX.  It swapped out without any problems.
B004982476|5|It's doing the job!! :D
B0001YXYYE|3|I thought it came with the tool but it doesn't. Hard to find tool separate to use
B00P5YN60C|1|I purchased these for my 2007 vw Touareg. They look nice and are new but they don't fit. They just fall off
B0087YIOYA|5|Measure in spec and does the job.
B00FP0G5EK|5|Just what I needed
B004I16M22|5|Very easy to install.
B0041QE7IA|1|Pushes you way more forward than factory seat
B000FOUWNQ|5|Worked great on my aftermarket radio but not as good on a factory radio.  Car has a built in window antenna.
B00NPCEEVQ|3|No nozzle provided with product.  Aftermarket nozzles don't fit well.  Gasket in cap hardened in two weeks and had to be replaced.  Can itself is heavy duty and fits the bag perfectly
B00X35BYFY|5|Bright!
B008QGCQHU|4|Good sticker but they are small.. about a foot long
B00ZVQ7J16|5|Item was exactly as described. Seller A++
B001OBIXEE|5|No down side here. Quality product, great price... free shipping.
B00C75I242|5|Great response and fit perfectly
B00O2AXTHK|5|Beautiful . ...I like!
B00KJB53A2|5|Very good
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Cool lights and their very bright white ....for a small 4&#34;<br />Assembly with mounting brackets...I used them for reverse lights in my 2008 silverado pick up<br />No comparison  to the stock reverse lights.I mounted them just under the bumper left and right side.and connected them to the trailer harness reverse wire.
B000CQOITQ|5|Getting it with an interlocking hitch would make sense but it works on any hitch.
B00JV3ZNPO|1|This is a universal type ignition coil, NOT a coil for a 1974 CB125s.  Hopefully I can make it work.
B008B5X5GC|5|Yes met and exceeded expectations very cost efficient and programmed just fine with programer from discount tire
B009DK4XK6|5|Hellow!<br />1999 subaru legacy wagon.<br />I interested your product.<br />I have one question.<br />I lost the top bolt and spacer.<br />Is this product included everything?
B002MAJAES|3|Its a very good quality and durable. The only issue I had was after I removed it from my car it left a residue that couldn't be removed. I had it on my car for about a year so maybe if you remove it every so often that would avoid it. Also I got this product a while back so they may have changed the magnet formula to avoid it.
B003IHKXKY|5|Worked great good quality! Going to order another one for my other trailer!
B00D9C2CDO|5|This purchase was well worth the money. Unlike many other brands of soft car toppers, the tie down straps are attached at the top side.  This reduces air drag and eliminated the noisy rattles.  Fits a lot more than I expected.
B000K040LA|5|Exactly as described
B009S31VVW|5|The part fit perfect and I didn't have any problems with installation. Thank you
B00RWO6HSG|5|Super bright. Installed on a Polaris Ranger
B008B5X5GC|5|Great price for OEM part
B00BCH4WTA|5|This is a great spray bottle.  I put purple Fabuloso in mine and it works great.  I have had no problems with it not working or with it leaking.
B00Z7KIZPA|5|This product is awesome!  Keeps my purse off the floor and handy while I'm driving or even riding.  I received it as a gift and now have others who want one.  Also, I have a little dog that loves to ride on the console and this holds her in from falling backward :)
B004JBYXP4|5|works like an oil filter should at a good price point for more info on the details of the mahle filters use google. Use on my 2009 honda pilot and 2006 civic si.
B002UZGCSW|1|Didn't fit my Passat. Been told that it will but did NOT work. So if you want it for 2008 Passat 2.0t Komfort look other ones, the cartridges ones will work.
B0065S6S8Y|5|Needed this since there is a recall about the HDM GMC!  For now this worked just like the last time!
B00MQ1G2Z8|5|Worked great very easy install.
B000ET9SB4|5|after ordering one of those off-brand air compressors on a shady site and having it break within a week, I decided that Amazon is the place to go.. found this beaut and it hasn't stood me up once! great device!<br />LPT: if you have racing tires on your bicycle, make sure you buy a valve attachment to the thin valve that's on them..
B00AQI5NOE|2|It wasn't the exact replacement for my 2008 Camry Hybrid but it fit. It was also missing the power wires for the light. I was a bit disappointed but at least  I have a visor up now I guess.
B00S9LRGSG|5|My husband loves these he is very tall so most shorts are not long enough for him. He loves these and wants more stocked up. Can't say enough good about them.
B00PG2V14G|5|ARRIVED SUPER FAST AND WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR
B0044AZ4BC|5|Good value, original part.
B00HR5RYNW|5|Fit perfectly in my 07 Pilot
B001IYXN24|5|There is a trick to using this stuff.  Like most rust penetrants or similar products the key to their effectiveness is patience.  Rust does not form overnight and will not dissolve quickly.  This has a very thin and almost slippery texture.  If applied and left to soak it will creep and seep into other rusted areas not directly coated with the product.  It dries leaving somewhat of a coating but does not evaporate completely.  I have used this on heavily rusted frozen threaded and unthreaded parts and it will, given time to work, free up parts crusted together with rust.  It is marked as something that can be painted over without fish eye contamination problems but I have yet to try that.
B001EUNUQG|1|smells like s*** but good product
B00V95OETI|5|These guys were awesome fit good and I'll definitely recommend  them
B0049U8JQY|1|Garbage.  Replaced after one year
B00DVMADVK|5|Good stickers will definitely order more and spread the word
B00I3I65LE|5|Fits great.<br />Easy to install<br />Sounds awesome.<br />Better mileage than factory had listed.
B0127P0QV8|5|The pictures do not do this mask justice. It's amazing probably the best Deadpool mask you'll find right now. My only issues were one it took long to get and you can't even pay more to get it faster and its a little difficult to see out of but other than that it's good. A must have for Deadpool fans.
B0088Q333E|5|Works perfect on E 39 BMW a headlight assemblies. Headlight assembly must be disassembled for installation but it's not a difficult process
