B001E2JNA6|5.0|All I can say is WOW.  I was sad to convert from my VHS edition to DVD a couple years ago because the color quality was so poor on the DVD. I used to watch my VHS tapes at least once a year but only watched the \\"special edition\\" DVD one time because I just couldn't bear the dark and drab colors, especially the indoor scenes. In some of the scenes the characters even looked a bit green. Then I popped in the Blu-Ray last night and it was amazing!  The colors are beautiful and there is great detail. I compared the DVD and Blu-Ray side by side during one scene and the difference was truly amazing.  The special features are new and quite interesting as they include current-day interviews with several actors, the writer and director. Any true fan who is lucky enough to own a Blu-Ray player should add this to their collection and toss the old DVD out the window (or donate it to your local library as I am doing)!!
032147404X|5.0|This is a great reference book for anyone who is starting out in photography or wanting to take their photography to the next level.  I do photography as a hobby and am always looking for how I can take better shots.    It is easy to read, doesn't get bogged down in the technical aspects except where needed and just focuses (pun intended) on capturing what you see and how you see it.    It seems that whether you actually use a SLR camera or a point-and-shoot, whether you take pictures because you like the art or just are interested in capturing family memories, you will have more tools to make the photographs just that much better.
B001TH16DI|1.0|Once again Paramount sticks it to us again. Their corporate greed borders on the line of outrighr theft from its own customers. The Star Trek Fans. Can't do this! Can't do that! Just more excuses to allow more releases of the same thing with just a tease of more extras. How many more releasesw do we have to buy to get what should have been available the first time. Well, I guess it won't happen in my lifetime.
0061537934|4.0|This book was very entertaining.  Written as the dog is the narrator, puts an interesting twist on the story of an amateur race car driver and his family.  It will make you laugh, cry, and angry at parts.

1416972242|5.0|The fantasy genre is well known for taking rich, varied, and well known mythology and twisting it up in new ways. Or at least, attempting to twist it up in new ways. Because let's face it, the vampire has already been invented. Now it's all about what you do with him.    So first, the really good- Cassandra Clare does a mighty fine job of taking rich and varied and well known mythologies and giving them a brand new spark of life that has not been written into the ground already. I enjoy that she picks bits of mythology from all over and uses it to create a world full of truths and half-truths and the people who have to deal with it all. This isn't just another fantasy novel. It reminds me of The Dresden Files for young adults.    The other really good thing about this book, is that the characters are a lot less cliched and stereotypical than most books in this genre. The main male character, Jace, might be pretty and the love interest (more on that in a moment) but he is also haughty, cocky, unlikeable and reactionary. She writes him so well that I sometimes find myself irritated with him- a beautiful and well drafted flaw. Who says our heroes need to be perfect anyway? This is also somewhat of a problem for her though too, because she tries so hard not to write predictable characters that they tend to fall out the other side of the extreme.    I'm also delighted by her fight scenes, which are clear and well written but not long and drawn out. Fight scenes have a tendency to be repetitive. She knows when to get on with it.    The bad- some of the prose is a little watered down. Contrite but clearly written with pleasure. Clare has never met a metaphor she didn't like. Still, the book was a page turner- I ferreted away in an empty cubicle at work to devour it during my breaks, flowery language or not.    The weird (and ugly)- The romance is bizarre. It's not even thinly veiled incestuous desire...it's right in your face and deals with it in a way that is going to make a lot of people uncomfortable. It makes me uncomfortable. I was at first horrified by her choice. Why would an author do this? But I am a little impressed with her ballsy choices for romances- a very homosexual blooming romance and a heartbreaking passion between two people who only recently found out their brother and sister. That's gutsy, and I can't say I haven't been craving some gutsy romances lately. But like I said, the incestuous romance is so weird it's not good. It reminds me a lot of the incestuous romance in The Royal Tennenbaums. I'm pretty sure we'll find out they aren't brother and sister, but honestly, the damage has been done.    Finally- I like Clary. She's weak and flawed and easily scared and up until the end of the second book, she's sort of a liability in every dangerous situation she's been in. And that makes sense, up until a very short while ago, she was a normal girl getting dressed up to dance at a goth club. It does surprise me though that no one offers to help her become less of a liability, until her powers manifest over night to make her super uber awesome. This is tragic. I'd rather have a main character who is just ok but brave and smart than one who can bring the world to its knees with no apparent explanation and no hard work.    But in the end, I was still captivated and still enthralled and I devoured it in a couple of days, to the neglect of everything else. In the end, that's what matters most to me.
B000W91RUG|4.0|Just a quick summary of the show, there are two nerds (Leonard and Sheldon) who work at a university (Sheldon is a theoretical physicist, Leonard is a physicist as well) and their two friends (Wolowitz and Raj) who spend a lot of time at Sheldon and Leonard's apartment (Wolowitz is an engineer and I believe Raj has to do with accounting?  I forget).  Penny the new neighbor shows up, Leonard falls quickly for her, and hilarity ensues.<br /><br />Anyway, I really like this show overall, the characters are over the top but mostly genuine, the jokes are good, and more often than not, Sheldon steals the show.  All in all, it's a good sitcom that might want to let up on the laughtrack a bit.<br /><br />As for the DVD set, I don't quite understand what happened.  The episodes are brilliantly reproduced and there are a lot of languages to choose from.  But in a show that makes fun of how much nerds like myself love commentaries and special features, there are none.  Not a commentary in sight, and only a paltry selection of extras on the third disc.<br /><br />So, if the price is right and you missed a lot of episodes in the first season, by all means pick this up.  Otherwise, it might be all right to skip it.
B001IKJSCM|4.0|If you enjoy Guy Ritchie's work or movies like [[ASIN:B00164CM46 Snatch (Feature) [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B00007ELEP Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels (Widescreen Edition)]], you will probably like Rocknrolla. It follows the same style of a learning about a group of gangsters between narration and their actions. Fairly decent story and again some very interesting hoods. I like this style movie myself and found it quite entertaining. A nice change from all the good cop, bad cop movies, and the ridiculous amount of cop TV shows like Law & Order: Special Bladder Control Unit.

B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Gal pals Vicky and Cristina go to Barcelona for the summer where they are immediately propositioned by an artist.  They both become enamored of him and then his ex-wife comes back into his life.<br /><br />I really hated this movie.  I couldn't relate to or understand any of the characters and found their lack of morals sad and off-putting.  Rebecca Hall was good as Vicky, but Scarlett Johansson wasn't believable at all as Cristina.  She looked like she was just sleepwalking through the movie, adlibbing her lines without emotion.  As the artist, Javier Bardem was supposed to be completely irresistible, but he didn't appeal to me at all.  Penelope Cruz had a small part as the artist's ex-wife; she was exciting and passionate and I wish her part had been bigger.<br /><br />Though the movie is all about sex, it was tedious and distasteful. It wasn't funny enough to be a comedy and it lacked any truly touching  moments. The DVD has no extras.  All in all, a disappointment.
B00177YA1K|4.0|The sci fi genre hasn't been too kind to us humans.  Our cities have been torched by alien spaceships or death rays, stomped on by monsters, flooded, frozen, flooded and frozen, attacked by ancient demons, subjected to diseases that turned many residents into zombies...you get the picture.  Global destruction has been threatened - and narrowly averted - many a time as well.  Chalk it up to boredom and/or appreciation for the vivid imagination of certain members of the directorial community, but audiences flock to see fictional representations of themselves menaced by all sorts of threats.  Honestly, and I say this with the knowledge that I have been one of these audience members more times than I can count, it can get a little old.<br /><br />When this movie came along there wasn't a whole lot like it out there in the sci fi canon.  The closest thing was Ghostbusters, a classic 80s comedy that set the tone for future cinematic ventures into the realm of tongue-in-cheek sci fi/supernatural humor.  MiB takes the same happy-go-lucky comedic formula one step further, imagining a world where aliens walk among us disguised as \\"regular\\" (or irregular as the case may be) people.  The possibilities with this concept were/are virtually limitless, and the film does a good job exploring them while reining in any tendencies to stray too far from the plotline.  It can be a tad formulaic at times but the originality and creativity that is evident outweighs the film's obvious flaws.<br /><br />The sci fi genre needs Spaceballs, Ghostbusters and MiB just as much as it needs The Day The Earth Stood Still, the Star Trek movies or Independence Day.  None of it should be taken too seriously, but at least with this film and its thematic kindred, you probably won't be the only person in the theater chuckling at what's happening onscreen.

1416550542|3.0|An interesting mystery that jumps forwards and backwards in time, telling the story of 3 generations of women. The Victorian parts were very well done. What could have been an outstanding novel, is in the hands of this author merely a pleasant read. But there's nothing wrong with light entertainment now and then.
B000YABYLA|4.0|When 16-year old tomboy and wise-cracker Juno (Ellen Page) discovers she's pregnant, she decides to look for a couple to adopt her baby.  She finds yuppies Vanessa and Mark (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman) and thinks they would be super cool parents.<br /><br />I was prepared to dislike this movie because I don't think teen pregnancy is comical, but I was won over by Ellen Page's quirky charm.  She's smart, independent, strong and very likeable, a true gem of an actress.  Michael Cera plays her clueless boyfriend; he's believably bewildered by the pregnancy and, though more interested in the track team than the baby, is quite appealing, too.<br /><br />Juno becomes a strong heroine in a tough situation.  The movie is funny and the characters are real and it has the off-beat feeling that indie movies often have.  Recommended if you can overlook the basic moral issue and enjoy the story.

B0018M6J90|4.0|Set in the 1930s (or thereabouts), this fine bit of fluff follows a few days in the life of Guinevere Pettigrew. That period starts at rock bottom. Guinevere finds herself on the street, with nothing but the clothes she wears. Her employer won't have her back - even the employment agency has given up on her. In a desperate moment, this out-of-work governess brazens her way into a penthouse flat with a blonde ditz.<br /><br />This supposed adult needs more governing than most whole housefuls of children, so staid and stolid Guinevere fits right in as \\"social secretary,\\" saving Delysia from herself. That sets Guinevere on a whole new path. At the same time that she's fixing others' romantic mixups, she's getting fixed up herself, with new clothes, a new look, and a bit more boldness than she knew she had in her. Her background follows her, though, and becomes the basis for a catty bit of blackmail.<br /><br />This art deco period piece won't suit the guns'n'chases crowd, but isn't the drippiest kind of chick flick either. If you can get into its subdued mood, though, Guinevere's growth makes this movie worthwhile.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

1439138311|3.0|My mother and I really wanted to like this book, but it was very slow and plodding, and we felt the writing did not do justice to the time period. After reading half the book, we were still unsure when it was suppposed to be placed. \\" After the war\\"? WW1 or WW2? None of the characters caught or held attention for very long. I would rather have read about Rose back in Ireland.<br /> So I am dilgently reading it, and will finish it, but am thinking about the old classic, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. After thirty years those characters still stand out.<br />I just finished ETTA, and the writer does a stunning job of incorporating period converstaion into the book.  Period work is hard to write, the conversation is so hard to capture right. This is not thrilling/interestng enough to send around to my reading circle/family like Finding Nouf. Thats the test of a bokk at our house, how many people do you want to send it to.

1594489505|4.0|This was a good novel.  I am not likely to read it again, but I did enjoy it.  It was a bit upsetting at times and I do not recommend it for those that want a happy story.  This novel is a drastic and eye opening look at what life is like for women under the Taliban.  WOW.  I realize how lucky I am to live where I do and how I do.  The story starts with Mariam as a young girl and unfortunately, she gets an early lesson in how men betray and abandon when her father hides her in a hut rather than allow people to know he has fathered a child with the housekeeper.  After a drastic occurence, he marries her off to an abusive shoemaker.  Enter Laila, an even younger girl who experiences love and loss by the age of 15 and becomes the shoe makers second punching bag.  In the middle of war torn Kabul and in between beatings, Mariam and Laila form a friendship that will cost one life and save the other.  There is both tragedy and joy in the end.  Not a story that will be easily forgot, but will certainly make you think about the situation people in other lands face.<br /><br />For anyone interested in books about women in the middle east, true or fiction, you may want to check out [[ASIN:0812976738 Kabul Beauty School: An American Woman Goes Behind the Veil]] and [[ASIN:0758227280 The Nightingale]]
B002436WFI|4.0|Terry Pratchett movies have a hefty challenge ahead of them -- they have to maintain the wit and quick plotting of Pratchett's books, and also juggle a lot of characters and subplots. And &#34;The Colour of Magic,&#34; adapted from the first two novels in Pratchett's brilliant Discworld series, is is more than up to the challenge. It's no &#34;Hogather&#34; -- it has rather slack direction at times -- but it preserves Pratchett's wry satirical sense of humour. And of course, it's all about a mercenary, cowardly failed wizard.<br /><br />Rincewind (David Jason) is ejected from the Unseen University, on the very day that Twoflower (Sean Astin) arrives with his many-legged Luggage. He's come to the Disc... to &#34;look at it.&#34; But after Rincewind tries to con Twoflower, the Patrician (Jeremy Irons) orders Rincewind to be the guide/bodyguard of the Disc's first ever tourist.<br /><br />After a massive fire sweeps through the city, the two end up fleeing Ankh-Morpork and running into all sorts of weird things -- a very assertive magic sword, a floating island full of see-through dragons, a dramatic dragonlady in a leather bikini, astrozoologists trying to determine Great A'Tuin's gender, the aged Cohen the (retired) Barbarian, druids, and even getting thrown clear off the Disc in a strange spacecraft. And you thought YOU had problems.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Unseen University is having troubles of its own -- the magical book Octavo is acting weird, and power-hungry Trymon (Tim Curry) is scheming against the Archchancellor. Even worse, a strange red star has appeared in the sky, and the world is facing destruction. The only thing that can save it is the spell in Rincewind's head.<br /><br />Perhaps it's because it's based on the first, roughest Discworld books (&#34;The Colour of Magic&#34; and &#34;the Light Fantastic&#34;), but &#34;Colour of Magic&#34; is not quite as funny or tightly-written as the previous Pratchett miniseries, the delightfully wacky and gripping holiday story &#34;Hogfather.&#34; The writing is not quite as complex or as witty, and the direction sometimes feels a bit slack (such as the bar fight scene, or Trymon skulking and scheming around the University).<br /><br />But despite these drawbacks, &#34;Colour of Magic&#34; is still a vastly entertaining story -- it has a solid plotline and it chugs away nicely after a somewhat sluggish beginning, and blossoms into full-out complexity about halfway through. Once it gets underway it starts to resemble a road-trip through fantasy-land, with our quirky tourist and wizard bungling their way across the Disc.<br /><br />Along the way there's some fun action (an upside-down duel), humorous dialogue (&#34;You weren't born with a mysterious birthmark in the shape of a crown, were you?&#34;), and a general air of tongue-in-cheekness. Best of all, it's a fantasy spoof -- Vadim Jean preserves Pratchett's clever satire aimed at the staples of your average fantasy: fantasy babes, prophecies, magic swords, retired barbarians, powerful artifacts, and even the idea of reality warping itself to save the &#34;hero.&#34;<br /><br />Jason is wonderfully snivelly and sour as Rincewind, a failed wizard who basically finds himself repeatedly swept up into bizarre, deadly circumstances even though he didn't want to be involved. Astin is even better as the hilariously oblivious Twoflower, who regards every disaster as yet another great adventure (&#34;We're going to run out of world!&#34; &#34;I have to see that!&#34;) as if he isn't entirely aware that reality is full of danger. And there's a talented supporting cast -- Curry chews the scenery with sneering aplomb, Karen David plays a humorously over-the-top dragon-lady, and Irons has a small but wonderful role as the chilly, efficient Vetinari. And of course, the brilliant Christopher Lee takes over as an increasingly disappointed Death.<br /><br />While the direction is often looser than it could be, &#34;The Colour of Magic&#34; is a delightfully clever romp across Pratchett's lovable flat planet. If nothing else, it will make you glad you're not Rincewind.thing else, it will make you glad you're not Rincewind.
B000BBOUCW|5.0|I own exactly three copies of Final Fantasy Advent Children: The Limited Collector's edition on DVD, the standard DVD, and this UMD, and the reason for that is because this movie is the best animated movie I have ever seen in my life!    It doesn't matter if you've never heard of Final Fantasy VII or even played the game before. The animation is so ground-breaking, unreal and utterly AWESOME that you won't care about stuff like that.     What you'll love is the amazing amount of detail put into the characters and backgrounds, the wicked-cool battle scenes and the fitting, if not unique musical score accompanying all of the \\"eye candy\\" overload.    Buy it now. You won't regret it.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I find it interesting that when graphic violence is used to reflect on the Christian savior's suffering it is unacceptable, but when it is used in the service of nihilism (such as \\"No Country for Old Men\\") it is artistic and perfectly justified no matter how salacious. Of course the hypocrisy and double standards of the mainstream media are old news, but it is striking to see such an obvious example of this critical imbalance, especially considering the beating Gibson took from critics.
B001KL3GWM|5.0|Derek Trucks is probably the greatest of the next generation guitarists. I just saw him at the Wiltern in L.A. and heard him play several cuts from his new album - among many other songs. I have not seen anybody master a guitar and dominate the stage as Derek did last night - since Jimi Hendrix - 40 years ago.<br /><br />In this new album, his inclusion of others, their vocals and full span melodies may cut down a bit on his guitar magic, but it is more settling and inclusive of the potential audience. His other Band members - and Susan and Mike on vocals - represent best in class - accross the board. This album brings this out. Neither Jimi or Eric ever let the guitar take away from their songs - they made sure the guitar enabled the song to go beyond perfect. This album does just that - and no one forgets that this is Derek's band and album. This might be Derek's \\"Joshua Tree\\" breakthrough - as happened to U2 several decades ago. No one should miss this album - and everyone should see Derek live and on stage.<br /><br />Absolutely one of the best musicians that I've ever seen!!!!

B000FS9MV0|5.0|I learned of Renee Olstead a few years ago shortly after her self titled album was released and have been hooked ever since.  Her voice is amazing for one so young and evokes some incredible emotions into the classics and contemporary pieces she sings.  Her duet with Chris Botti on When I Fall In Love is sophisticated and smooth as you imagine sitting in a cozy little dark and cool jazz club watching them croon it out with the band behind them.  But Renee doesn't submit an album that's all laid back and sultry, she lives it up with a lick of fun in Thanks For The Boogie Ride which harkens back to the kicks of Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy. Having been a fan of Nancy LaMott for years, I am excited when new singers appear that bring something a little different to the music world and Renee Olstead is a definite star amongst them all. This album is definite MUST HAVE.
0307269752|2.0|Stieg Larsson's first novel was an improbable success. Ironically, he died before it was published in English and before it hit the best seller lists. For some reason Scandinavian crime novels have become a growth sector in the last few years. Larsson, who was originally an editor, died in his fourties in 2004. His protagonist is an unjustly accused journalist who, surprise, surprise is handsome, athletic, brilliant, and sexy; at the same time carrying on affairs with a dysfunctional teenager (the Girl with the Tattoo who is not, despite the title in English, the central character), his friend's wife and a fiftyish school principal who is a member of the wealthy Vanger family. The patriarch of the family hires him, despite his complete lack of experience, to search for the culprit in the disappearance fourty years before of a young girl. Of course he discovers the evil villain through a series of near miraculous coincidences and in the grand finale a deus ex machina materialises from Australia. Not since Dickens have I seen as many improbable developments. Characterisation is as weak as the plot and the attempts to describe the feelings of a teenage female are as cringemakingly awful as they always seem to be when adult males essay this task. I shall not be waiting with bated breath for the release of the other two novels. I would suggest that readers instead look at the brilliant and still eminently readable crime novels of Maj Sjowal and Per Wahloo which are being reissued.
B000VLOKQI|4.0|I am a huge fan of The Who and when my bass player told me about this movie that was on the market I had to get it.  Last Christmas it was a gift from my sister.  This box set is 2 dvds.  The first one being the movie Amazing Journey which tells the story of The Who from their childhood right up to the release of Endless Wire.  Townshed and Daltry are interviewd quite a bit through this movie and Townshend talks about how he grew up with the war going on and Roger talks about how he met John Entwhistle and invited him into his band The Detours.  Townshend also talks about his fasination with Meher Baba.  How he looked at him as a spirtual guidence.  There's a good amount of live footage in this movie as well as interviews with managers past and present, other musicians including Sting, The Edge, Steve Jones, Eddie Vedder and Noel Gallagher. I would have liked it better if they talked more about the albums.  Albums from Who's Next up through It's Hard get very little talk and would have liked to hear them elaborate on the albums more.  The only mention of Endless Wire is the very last scene of the movie when on the screen it says in 2006 The Who released Endless Wire.  thier first album in 24 years.  I would have liked to have really heard more about the ideas on the new Who album since I had been waiting forever for them to put out a follow up to It's Hard (see my review for Endless Wire).  Disc 2 is 6 different films titled 6 Quick Ones.  The first 4 focus on the band members individualy.  Who Art You is a film focusing on what Townshend describes as auto destructive art.  And the last one  Who's Back shows them in the studio recording a new song for their Then And Now greatest hits album, Real Good Looking Boy, with Greg Lake on bass.  And as a bonus feature on disc 2 an extreemly old film of them playing at the Railway Hotel when they were called The High Numbers and is the earliest footage known to exist of them on film.  The band are still kids at this time.  This is one of the best Who dvds on the market and The Who has a ton of dvds out there.  If you are a music dvd collector you will really want this in your collection.  This is one of the best, if not the best, Who dvds on the market right now.

B000002N1E|5.0|Prince hit his evolutionary stride right around \\"Sign 'O' The Times\\", but he kept on putting out A-grade material right up to this album. This is the last Prince release of all-original material that I have enjoyed from stem to stern, without a weak track to be found. From the in-your-face rock of \\"Endorphinmachine\\" to the slick and furious \\"I (Eye) Hate You\\", it's a tour de force that any Prince fan shouldn't be without. It's too bad the album itself is out of print. I have a cherished CD copy and an extremely limited numbered vinyl edition of this album which I will never give up.    No, it's not Purple Rain, and it's not even Parade, but consider this: Ever since, and coincidentally since removing himself from the muck of his Warners contract, Prince has released album after album of substandard fare. Emancipation came close to being a good album, but far too much filler. The only album I've enjoyed since then is Musicology. The rest is a few good songs surrounded by also-ran material and Prince trying way too hard to sound modern, which just doesn't cut it for him.    In any case, buy this and cherish it. It certainly deserves more recognition than it received when it was released, even if Prince abandoned the album in its hour in need of publicity.

B001R4MEYS|3.0|This album is really good, but it's not as good as Blood Mountain, for me.  I really dig long, epic songs, which this album has many, in the vain of old Metallica.  The issue is that there is too much build up to the really cool parts. Even still their musicianship is insane.  I don't know how they write music so complex.  All these guys could teach at Berklee.  Anyway, good album, great band.  In fact Mastadon is my favorite metal band out right now, and probably the best metal band to come out in 15 years.  Buy it!

0060987464|5.0|If you're unfamiliar with the genius of his music the book is still worth reading; if you're unfamiliar with the use of recreational products then you may miss some of the more salient points.  It's nothing less than a indictment of our sick society & the misunderstand and unappreciated bi-products of that degenerative culture we call America.  I found myself identifying with the man for a majority of the book; so there is another alien life form out there that still can't find his spaceship.  The only criticism is that it just didn't last long enough; could have been much longer in my opinion....maybe he'll do a sequel!

B00022M518|4.0|Here Come the Warm Jets being Eno's debut solo album and his 1973 release was both a critical as well as a commercial at the time of its release. The album peaked at #26 in the UK album charts. Songs that standout on this release are \\"Some of them are Old\\" and \\"Cyndy Tells me\\". The booklet is strange with a cover that looks like a friend made that photograph. No lyrics are included but we do get a nice list of whom plays what on the album. It sounds very experimental and sounds a bit like a mix between experimental music and rock. 4/5.
B00005QAPH|5.0|This is one of the most wonderfully moving films I know.  A great creative man has a kind of breakdown - he is not sure that he can continue on, seeking his next project.  So he withdraws to a sanatorium, where he attempts to collect himself and rest, so that he can go forward.<br /><br />There you see his entire life unfold before his imagination:  his deeply troubled relationship with his wife (incredibly well played by Anouk Aimee, perhaps her greatest role), his crass mistress who revels in the humiliation of his wife, and all the hangers on that surround the truly talented.  Then there are his memories, which interweave with reality and are so indistinguishable from it that at times the viewer is uncertain what has really happened.  Much of it is bizarre and surrealistic, a collage of the unresolved, the loved, the pressing need, the hope.  It is all in Mastroianni's expression, which is impassive yet full.  Everything is grotesque yet understated and subtle.<br /><br />He feels besieged, overwhelmed as so many people keep coming at him, and yet he tries to see his way forward.  It is that powerful nexus where the creative force, personal crisis, and the demands of his industry collide.  Never has it been so well portrayed.  It moves me to tears every time I see it.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.
0385751893|4.0|I picked this up not knowing anything about it...I saw it, read the back and bought it.  I remember seeing a sticker on the front that said, \\"soon to be a motion picture.\\"  I suppose I didn't pay very close attention to that bit of information, or that this book is aimed at the 10-15 year old category (my opinion).  I'd have to say, I doubt children much under 12 would understand \\"the unspoken\\" areas of the book.  The book makes reference to things that children might not pick up on like adults. Overall, I think this is a great book to spark conversation, and to help children understand what the holocaust was about, how children were affected, and how much pain a fence can cause.  Super story.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|I watched this and decided instead of telling people to beware I would tell people to see it. As far as I am concerned Meryl Streep has been in a bunch of crappy movies lately. PS Hoffman has never been in anything he did not make better. The 2 of them in this movie make for a fantastic dynamic. This should have won every academy award. The tension between the 2 of them was so real you could breathe it. It was so reminicent of the nuns I dealt with as a child. It so reminds you that gossip destroys life. Everything about the movie was subtle, speaking volumes about the way professionals can not defend themselves in the face of a dedicated accuser. Have you beaten your wife again? A very professional movie from all the technical standpoints. IT was also interesting in that it told the story of someone probably wrongly accused. Great.
006085880X|4.0|Another book that probably doesn't need another reviewers opinion...but I'll add it anyway.  Picoult does it again with a story that finds it's way right to the readers heart.  Again, there are feelings for these characters, and what problems they are facing.  This book I have to admit wasn't one of the \\"best\\" novels Picoult has written, but I understand why I feel this way. In the end (no spoilers) I found myself still wanting to know more, however what I found myself concerned with \\"wasn't the point\\" of the book.  Once I sat back and thought about the book and what it was trying to do, I felt satisfied.  As with other Picoult books, the books make readers \\"think\\" and try and understand different points of view...this does just that.  If your a lover of Picoult, this is just another one to add to your collection.  I have to say, I loved the PS section at the end of the book!
0452289963|1.0|Thank God I only paid 3.50$ for this book.  By the time you a few pages into chapter one, you know it is meant for the complete and total novice to Buddhism.

1416594884|5.0|I am writing this review because my perspective seems to be somewhat different from that of many of the reviews here.    First, I have never read any other novel by Le Carré, so I am not making a comparative analysis. On its own, then, I found this book compelling. It treats a serious current issue with the seriousness it deserves with no unnecessary detours into sex or the Hamburg landscape (very beautiful - I have spent enjoyable times there).    Second, the portrayal of a Muslim refugee from Chechnya, who may or may not be a violent jihadist, I found to be nuanced and credible, though extremely strange. I found the depiction of his lawyer - I am a retired trial lawyer - less credible but I was willing to suspend disbelief in the interests of the larger story.    Third, several reviewers have referred to Le Carré's anti-Americanism. There are in fact very few scenes involving Americans and I did not find them incredible. Indeed, I was more surprised at the actions of the official Germans and in particular their treatment of a German lawyer from a highly respected family. Is any of that true to life? I have no idea, but then I have no personal knowledge of spies or, for that matter, of the police forces of Germany or any other country (I was a civil lawyer).    Finally, and to me most important of all, I couldn't put the book down.
0553381687|5.0|I'm not sure what took me so long to begin reading \\"Song of Ice and Fire.\\"<br />I had been looking for something to satiate my lust for great literary fantasy since \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" was read to me as a child, to little avail.<br />Oh, Robert E. Howard became a love and addiction for a while, and still is. Stephen R. Donaldson captured my attention for a spell with his brilliance and originality, despite the ridiculous names. (I might add that his lesser series, beginning with The Mirror of Her Dreams, is devoid of the stupid names and is a great choice for those waiting on Martin's next book, as it is very much like these books for it's non-quest plot, mystery, and political intrigue).<br /> Jordan, the three Terrys, and a slew of others could only serve as a fantasy fix for a book or two. Though they are all good, imaginative writers, their worlds seemed only almost complete, and usually heavilly dependent on Tolkien.<br />I heard from many fans that Martin was different, and some even had the gall to put him above Tolkien. This was probably one reason why I neglected these books- the sacrilege seemed disrespectful. Another reason might have been the fact that I'd heard the series was based on The War of the Roses, and that seemed un-unique to me, and a little too much like Alternative History. Too, the series was by a new author, not an elder sage....and it wasn't even finished. I don't like to start reading books (or longer books that some call \\"series\\") that aren't finished, and what's more I have never been able to see the point in taking more than a trilogy to get through a single plot. It always seemed to me that most long fantasies are just a means of riding the gravy train for far too long. I put Martin on the backburner despite the recommendations, and only after a decade finally picked up the books.<br />  I was entirely surprised to find out that Martin deserves the title of \\"The American Tolkien\\" hands down. This is a new king of fantasy, and one book of only a handful in the genre who actually makes it rise above mediocrity in the literary world.<br /> Here is a world that may be as well thought out as even Middle Earth. It isn't based on the War of the Roses, but rather inspired by it, as the myths of the Celts and the Norse inspired Tolkien. It is as black and dark as Howard(or in some cases even darker) and as realistic and witty as Dickens. What's more, Martin is able to speak from many a character's perspective in a convincing and engaging way, be it child, man, cripple, or knave. His dialogue is true to human nature, and his heroes and villians change and evolve as people do only in the real world. What's more, he doesn't pull any punches; no one survives just because Martin has grown attached to them, or fears that his audience has. Events happen that WOULD happen in reality, rather than portraying only events that will get the reader from point A to point B. There are no ex-machinas, and despite Sansa's protests this is no fairy tale.<br />All and all, this is definitely the best author of fantasy since Tolkien.<br />Besides a handful like the aforementioned Donaldson and Howard, there are none others who even come close.<br />  It has been years since valor and sacrifice in a book have welled tears in my eyes like they did during the reading of LOTR, and the returning emotions are much welcomed.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|THE READER in the form of Bernard Schlink's masterful book made an emotional impact on those who read it.  And for once the book to film version holds nearly as much agony and beauty as the original. The screenplay is by David Hare (whose transformation of 'The Hours' was so worthy) and it captures not only the dialogue of Schlink's novel but fills in the silences with well-constructed added commentary.  Stephen Daldry ('The Hours', 'Billy Elliot') directs with great sensitivity to not only the narrative story but to the myriad metaphors that fill the quiet spaces in both the novel and the film.<br /><br />Michael Berg (David Kross, a significant discovery!) lives in Berlin, falls ill with Scarlet Fever, and is given shelter from the rain and cold by a stern appearing Hanna (Kate Winslet). When Michael recovers from his illness he returns to Hanna's flat to thank her for her kindness and there begins a strange and beautiful love affair between a virginal shy lad and an older but obviously emotionally flat yet needy woman.  Despite Michael's family's disdain for his absences away from home, Michael surrenders himself to the passion of love and Hanna softens as she pleads for Michael to read to her.  Reading and sex become exchanges for this rare couple until Hanna disappears.  Michael discovers her some ears later when Hanna is on trial for war crimes (she had been a guard in the concentration camps).  Hanna allows her pride to override reality in confessing she had been the one who had written the orders for the extermination of Jews - this despite the fact that Hanna is illiterate, a fact known only to Michael.<br /><br />While Hanna is imprisoned Michael (now Ralph Fiennes) records his reading of books to send to Hanna and during Hanna's twenty years of confinement she learns to read and write because of Michael's efforts and gifts.  Once Hanna is scheduled to be released from prison and the prison matron convinces Michael to be in charge of the aging Hanna, the story takes turns and the ending is so gently painful that sharing it would ruin the impact for those who have neither read the book nor seen the film.<br /><br />Winslet, Kross, and Fiennes are excellent in these very difficult roles.  Their performances are enhanced with the supporting cast that includes special cameos by Lena Olin and Bruno Ganz and some other fine German actors.  The mood of the film is gray except of the isolated moments of bliss Michael and Hanna share and the atmosphere is well balanced by the musical score of Nico Muhly.  This is a film worth viewing repeatedly, there are that many layers of meaning to glean from this cinematic triumph.

B00243FQFA|4.0|I just love how Stargate series usually end.  They tie things up nicely, give you a really cool battle, and they don't kill off your favorite characters just to make a stupid point.    The season's arc was kind of disjointed and confusing.  You will notice during this season that they are already cutting off the threads for some stories.  Over all, the episodes show a little bit of character growth, especially in Woolsey, Rodney, and Sheppard.  There is no big bad until the last two episodes.  The big bads they do have this season are resolved quickly (for the most part).    I like the episodes with Daniel Jackson.  Pairing him off with Rodney was an excellent choice.    I might want to add that the information above is inaccurate.  Torri Higgison wasn't in the last two seasons as a regular.  She was barely in Season 4, and wasn't at all in Season 5.  They missed Robert Picardo who took over Amanda Tapping's role after she took over Torri's role.  Confused? We all are!!    They also forgot to credit the one the only Dr. McKay (David Hewlett).  Like him or hate him, the man can evoke emotions in people.  He also has a quirky sense of humor, which if you can get it, is hilarious.  I highly recommend \\"A Dog's Breakfast\\" if you are a David Hewlett fan.    Still the series ended when it should have ended.  There were already rumors of cast members leaving and going away.  So now they don't have to kill them off in dumb ways.      Well the series does not tie off all of the threads.  There is plenty of room for the movies which MGM is salivating over.

It is a page turner and hard to put down.  he does not sugar coat, but he expresses the realities in his home country as hard as it is to read sometimes.  You gain a great appreciation for the lives of the people, the landscape.  The book is compelling.  I am excited about any new project Hosseni has in the works and wished there was a third book.

There is nothing unusual here, as Sri Nisargadatta is consistent with Ramana Maharshi. There is no dualism. The message is clear.

I was given a subscription for Martha Stewart Living Magazine for Christmas a couple of years ago and have kept every issue. But that one year is just a fraction of what appears in this new release from Random House Canada. It covers 17 years of craft content from the magazine packed into 32 chapters!<br /><br />I have been reading (drooling over) Martha Stewart's Encyclopedia of Crafts for the last couple of weeks, savoring every last page (and there's over 400 pages!)<br /><br />Each craft has an overview, the supplies needed, very explicit step by step instructions and many projects incorporating the techniques. All are accompanied by absolutely gorgeous full colour photos.<br /><br />Many of the ideas presented are updated techniques on historical crafts such as candle making, soap making and quilling to name a few. Although some crafts may seem daunting on first view, they really aren't. I'm thinking of making candles for Christmas gifts next year. I could tin punch some holders for them. And then use stencilled gift wrap, stamped cards, origami boxes and calligraphic notes from other chapters to package them!<br /><br />I've enjoyed working with stained glass before, but haven't tried my hand at glass etching. There are some great ideas for starting small with tumblers and working your way up to mirrors and hanging pieces.<br /><br />Some of the ideas are so simple and yet so visually stunning. I loved the framed pressed botanicals. Sun prints were something I'd never heard of before. Using light sensitive paper, you burn the image in reverse and use it for a variety of designs.<br /><br />Some of the chapters use newer techniques. I'm a dedicated sewer and had a huge light bulb moment when I came to the chapter on polymer clay. Buttons! I've always purchased those cute crafty buttons to finish off a child's outfit, but I'm going to try making some of my own.<br /><br />I haven't even begun to touch on everything included in this truly encyclopedic book.

B001TODCII|2.0|Taken made by the same French team that made the Transporter flicks. Clueless mother lets her daughter go on a trip to Europe with only another girl who just supposedly turned 18. They get kidnapped by an Albanian ring who specialize in white slavery, etc. Liam Neeson, the father, is an ex some kind of special op's for the government. In other words, he knows how to take care of business. He goes over to Paris and proceeds to become a one man Albanian butt kicking crew. I believe he kills or maims half the Albanians in Paris before he gets his daughter back! If you have ever seen Mystery Science Theater, with the robot making fun of the proceedings , then that was I watching this flick. Neeson does a great acting job keeping a straight face throughout. Lots of silly action and over the top fighting and graphic violence. Give it a 2 for the amusement factor.    The glowing reviews for this film makes me believe that the criteria for the action genre has sunk to a new low. The plot is so obvious that a 7 year old can follow it. It is simplistic, banal, and utterly predictable. The film takes itself too seriously, and has little relation to the actual kidnapping problem in Europe. The film would have been more palatable if done tongue in cheek. Where is the nuance? The bad guys take incompetence to a new level, while the good guy performs at superhero level. I think that these types of movies appeal to the reptilian brain in all of us. We jettison all critical facilities because our deep emotional needs for order are met at a basic level.

0061808121|5.0|Part of what prompted me to buy this classic on audiobook was that Sissy Spacek was the narrator. I knew she would do it justice, as well as lend authenticity with her Southern accent. To Kill a Mockingbird is a classic that continues to endure today. The audiobook version, as narrated by Ms. Spacek, is riveting and engrossing. I looked forward to my commute because I knew there was more drama or just more of a wonderful story waiting to unfold!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|A extremely different type of Vamp movie.It takes a few minutes to get into the movie. The first several minutes were dull and boring for me. I had heard from so many people that is was the \\"best\\" of its kind..a true love  story so I was expecting somthing over the top. In my opinion it was not that good....I didn't find any of the characters likable. I will probably never watch the movie a second time but I am glad I watched it once. I wish I had rented it instead of buying it.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|While Next is an interesting story and not one I've really heard yet, it does lack some development. They should've spent some of their budget on making the film a little longer to develop the stories and characters a little more. Honestly, a 2 hour movie is not hard to sit through. A 90 minute movie that doesn't make sense is hard to sit through.    The story will take some time to understand, you may not understand it until the end but it is a good story, again it just lacks some development. Cage's character definitely lacks development as it is hard to understand how he does some of these things until after he does them. The relationship with Biel's character can be easily explained, however it is somewhat creepy if you know their age difference.    Overall this was an interesting and one I'll probably watch again as it kept my attention for most of the movie and was fairly entertaining. I give it a 7 because it just wasn't developed enough.

031606792X|2.0|Well, this novel was a complete waste of time.      After 3 books of Bella and Edward being so in love, having so much angst over their relationship being impossible to work out because he is vampire and she is human, they get married.  Edward insists. Bella just wants sex but no; Edward wants her bound to him forever first.  And after 3 books of Bella begging Edward to initiate her into the world of physical love, he finally does-- and there is NO description of it.  At all.  All we get are descriptions of the next morning and her being full of bruises, bumps and goose feathers (Edward bit through the bed pillows for some reason and scattered feathers everywhere).  That sounded really interesting there for a minute; I was all ready to read a flashback account of very kinky vampire sex that resulted in a lot of damage to soft tissues and textiles, but no.  Not even a few words about vanilla missionary-position-marital-coitus. SO DISAPPOINTING.  Edward is guilt ridden afterwards for wrecking so much havoc on her and his mom's bedroom and vows to abstain from touching her again sexually while she's human.  Bella goes nuts.  She gets out her Secret Weapon Sexy Lingerie provided by her sister-in-law to seduce her husband.  It works, and talk about a miracle there! I was pretty sure by then that all this fuss Edward was making about how bad he wanted her, but didn't trust himself to touch her, was just a load of piswallow. But we still have no description AT ALL of what happens.  We just hear about the headboard on the bed being partly destroyed, as a result of Edward attacking Bella, because she's wearing the sexy black panties.  At this point as I'm reading, I'm beginning to wonder if maybe the author has never had sex.        Anyway, Bella gets pregnant during these honeymoon encounters.  Edward is beyond dismayed; I'm not sure why.  In any case, I didn't think that was possible, with Edward's bodily fluids (such as they are) being venomous and excruciating painful for humans, not to mention fatal. She resembles Moby Dick within a couple of weeks so maybe that's why Edward is so upset.  It turns out the child is half vampire (what a surprise!) and its physical demands on her body won't allow her to take any human nourishment (she throws it up.)  She winds up having to drink blood in order to feed the fetus and keep herself alive (this is SO unimaginative!) Jacob comes around to hover over Bella, annoy Edward and trade insults with Rosalie, which is the only reason to read this part of the book.  Jacob is great and I definitely appreciated him a lot more after reading about Edward as husband.  We also find out the kid is going to be gnawing its way out of her belly like the Alien because Carlisle finds this in some old obscure legend about a human/vampire offspring (I'm starting to feel a little bilious myself with these stupid plot devices.)  It turns out Edward has to do an emergency caesarian when the kid starts chewing its way out. After so much damage and lots of bloodletting Bella is dying.  Edward finally bites her for real and injects her straight into the heart with his own venom.  After 3 days of intense suffering, Bella becomes a vampire.       This is when the story gets STUPID.     I won't bore you with the rest of the details but the end result is that Jacob imprints on Bella and Edward's daughter Renesmee (Renesmee?! Who thought THAT one up?!) and will be marrying her when she grows up. Which will only be in a couple of years because she's growing like the kid in the 80's 'V' TV Series.  Bella and Edward live Happily Ever After at their small stone cottage in Carlisle's and Esmee's backyard, with the garden behind a quaint wooden gate and little pond.  The Bad Volturi vampires have gone away and there is peace with the werewolves and everyone is free to live forever (literally) in Twilight-land with everything they want.      This book is without doubt the biggest waste of time of any of the others and sorry end toa pretty good series.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Miss Potter is a delightful film about children's author and illustrator Beatrix Potter, played by Renee Zellweger. Beatrix decides she will not marry, and instead will pursue a career as an author and illustrator of children's books - a very bold and unusual thing in Victorian England in the late 1800's. She receives scant encouragement in her pursuit until the Warne brothers agree to publish her first book, The Tale Of Peter Rabbit, and assign it to their youngest brother, Norman, in the hope he will fail and thereby give up the idea of joining them in the family business. Played by Ewan McGregor (Star Wars, Moulin Rouge, Down With Love, Big Fish), Norman becomes enchanted with Miss Potter and her book, as does his sister, Millie, played by Emily Watson (Gosford Park, The Waterhorse). The three become great friends, and eventually Norman and Beatrix fall in love.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Miss Potter's books are selling like hot cakes, and she eventually finds herself a very wealthy woman - much to the surprise of her mother, who has never understood her or her interest in art - and can now make her own way in the world - again, highly unusual for the time. She begins buying up estates in the Lake District of England - at first to settle there, but later to preserve the area as a farming district. Eventually, she donates 4,000 acres of the most prime real estate to the British people as a national trust. This is one of the most gorgeous films you will ever see, and a wonderful story about a wonderful lady. It is full of imagination, cleverness and childhood magic. Director Chris Noonan, writer Richard Maltby, Jr., and the entire production crew should be commended for creating a cinematic gem.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith
0440178002|3.0|So sorry, I am not worthy of the honor of reviewing this novel. If however, my Lord insists it, then I shall endeavor to offer up some humble thoughts regarding its mighty, even epic narrative. Neh? The scope is so vast, the characters and settings are so many, the head is liable to spin at times, so sorry. But the arc it follows is like a peregrine's path through the sky: long but fast and with vicious twists along what might otherwise have seemed a predictable path. I'm sure my Lord would agree that parts of the story can become quite tedious. I am not speaking of the slow-to-develop romance between Mariko and the Anjin-san nor even of the dueling political machinations of Toranaga and Ishido. No, Sire. This humble vassal speaks more to the text and how Japanese is interwoven with the barbarian words in so many places. And then how barbarian words come even to replace Japanese! Or barbarian words standing in for the words of other barbarian tongues! If you'll excuse this vassal's petulant tongue, Sire, it's enough to make one fart dust, so sorry. But these tedious affectations do blend in after a while, neh? and the narrative is quite the enjoyable one -- full of so much intrigue and humor. A rousing and enjoyable tale of which I am not worthy to comment further. Please, I cannot live with this shame. Please allow me to commit seppuku at once.
B000002H33|1.0|I don't know why people think this is Metallica's greatest album! It's the same riff over and over and over and over, and I have not even seen a MOP music video on MTV. Like seriously, where's the variety, like in St. Anger?<br /><br />So I say to avoid this album at all costs and get St. Anger. Load and Reload are awesome as well, and if St. Anger is too badazz for you, get those two first to prepare for the ANGER!!!

Made to Stick is this kind of book.  It is an awesome read with compelling case studies and takeaways for everything from business to parenting.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|The Settlers of Catan caught my interest after reading an article about it, and reading the reviews. I have to say I found it to live up to its reputiation as an extremely fun game. It is sort of a cross between Risk, Monopoly and Age of Empires.  The gameplay goes at a good pace, and the game takes about the right amount of time to be satisfying, but not boring. It has been the first real board game that I've found enjoyable in quite a while.    When setting up for the first time, Settlers seems a little overwhelming. There are a lot of pieces, and the instruction book is much more than we've grown used to (the single sheet, or even printed on the box lid). However, once you begin playing, and figure it out, it is pretty simple.  The makers simply include a lot more than most board makers, and the book has a  glossary to help look up many things, which makes the intructions much bigger. I do highly suggest going to the profeasy.com website recommended on the package to see a sample game with some instruction. It was a good tutorial, and made it easy to jump in sooner.    All in all, I can tell this will become a family favorite. I am very happy with the game.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|URRRRRREEEEYES!!!! A couple of factors make Death Magnetic the best album Metallica has produced since Justice, Master, and Ride. Metallica finally chucked Bob Rock to the weeds and snagged Rick Rubin to reignite the group. That coupled with Kirk, for lack of a better term Unleashed, my god man!!  Kirk Hammet makes this album. He seems to unleash his frustrations with being confined by James, Lars, and Bob Rock for the past two decades in a funky , metal, F&*$ Y%#!  If it could be imagined over his body of work that Kirk had this in him, I never could.  He has managed to put one hand on the unique riffs and solo's that helped make Justice, Master and Ride so great and another on a current funky metal edge that drips with thought and flavor.     There also seems to be a fundamental shift in the lyrics and vocals from what they've produced over the last several albums which is also refreshingly reminiscent of their earlier stuff. This album appears to have been devised with allot of thought and patience in contrast to the last few and demonstrates why they are who they are.  This is the one I've been waiting for! Metal horns!~~!
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|This is truly a film that defines the overused and utterly cliche'd term 'roller coaster ride' when referring to pop cinema.  This is the second best Indy film out of the four.  I am writing this review to shed some light and to give the great film its due.<br /><br />We'll start the review by noting that this Spielberg's least favorite Indiana Jones film.  Is it relevant to the viewer?  No, so save that as an argument against the film.  Spielberg wasn't comfortable with the dark nature of the material, and he was that way from jump street.  I'm sure he regretted jumping onboard with the script.  See Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade for evidence.  The third Indy movie is so desperately trying to recapture the vibe of Raiders that it becomes one of its downfalls. Plus, Last Crusade does the opposite of what critics claimed Temple of Doom did, it went way too lite and cute. Last Crusade brings back characters we've already met in Raiders and does nothing new or interesting with them.  Brody went from the fatherly professor to the bumbling comic relief.  Sure, it's justified, but its not necessary to any of the plot's proceedings.  Spielberg also tried to give the third Indy depth, but forgot that this type of character needs none, and any is never enough when you have big chases and special effects to contend with.  Plus, Indy part three had the weakest villain of the four.  But with all that said, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, like Kingdom of the Krystal Skull are both four star films, with great love for the serial genre, but suffer from the fact that they are parts three in four in a long running and ultimately tired series.  Okay, enough of that.<br /><br />A lot of harsh criticisms has fallen upon Cate Capshaw's performance as Willie Scott, the Indy girl of this particular installment.  All b.s., empty femm-nazi diatribes from people who aren't in on the style of this type of adventure film.  Oh, they'll go on and on about how Marion Ravenwood(great name!) from Raiders was more of a independent, equal of Indy's and Willie is the typical screaming damsel in distress.  They're half right.  They're right about Willie's character mold, but the bottom line in these films is that the female always gets captured and needs to be informed or saved by Indy.  Marion was tough, but she still had to get captured for saving in the long run....so, who cares?  Marion came along right after the film Alien had introduced film audiences to a similar character.  People were jonsing for this type of heroine.  More power to them.  But, in the tradition of not copying one's self the sequel(which is really a prequel is if you look at the time line) goes for a more traditional Faye Wraye type of female lead.  The thing people leave out when describing the Capshaw performance is how perfect her comic timing is.  Yes, she's a screaming brat of a lounge singer but it's all played for laughs and Capshaw hits the comic notes just perfectly.  Yes, she sceams too much, but almost all these types of films have too much screaming from their female characters, they still do.  Capshaw is really funny in this film.  She has three shining moments in the story; the dining scene in the palace, the spike trap with Indy and Shortround, and the seduction scene right before Indy is attacked by the Thuggee in his room.  Well directed, perfectly acted, really funny and well timed, and truly reminiscent of the old serials of the 30's and 40's.  There's a Howard Hawk's level of timing and exchange in these scenes that is awesome to behold.<br /><br />This one isn't as prominent, I think, but I have heard jibes against the character of Shortround.  Apparently, he's really annoying, and the fact that a kid was included into a serial-inspired, adventure series most commonly marketed and for children was a big insult to bed-wetting, basement dwelling fan boys.  Sure, I hate when kids are introduced for the 'cute' factor, but this particular kid was restrained and heis actually likeable.  He's used as a foil to the Willie character and they become the comic duo act of the film.  This type of comedy is necessary or the film would've gone as dark or darker then the original concept had intended.  Plus, the comedy is in the vein of Laurel and Hardy, broad and goofy, and in the tradition of many other film's this series is emulating.  Also, this film doesn't have the benefit of having Indy as a professor or his interactions of an old flame, so having Shortround gives Indy his humanity and makes him less of an invincible action movie cypher.  The same people who object to Shortround seem to have no problems with the overly sentimental addition of Indy's strained father and son relationship in the third installment.<br /><br />Now onto the darkness...OOOHHHH, the darkness.  Personally, I am always up for some shades of black in my traditional action adventures fims.  So was the audiences of 1985, this film was a huge hit, equal to the box office of the original.  The film's subject involves a cult with mystical powers give to them by some rocks, that enslave children in underground caverns and mines.  Yeah, its pretty bleak stuff way before we get to the heart-ripping scene, which is in essence no less dark or graphic then the nazi's melting at the end of Raiders.  The tone of the film shifts from the goofy tropes of the serial world to the Abbott and Costello stylings of comedy.  The silly nature of the whole Indy series warrants such shifts and they come naturally when they wouldn't in a film such as Lethal Weapon or Die Hard(just see the horrible Lethal Weapon 4 for proof).  The villains of this film are truly straight out of any old or new horror film.  They last and you can't wait to see Indy triumph.<br /><br />The sets in this film are the best of the entire series!  The cult's underground mine lair is truly amazing to behold.  The design and lighting in all of these scenes are all perfectly executed, original and belong to the wonderful camera work of Douglas Slocombe(DP on the first three Indy films).  The action scenes are like nothing seen at the time.  They've been eclipsed by modern technology but they are still awesome in execution with a little perspective on the mind when watching.  Though, this film has less action then all the Indy films.  We start off with a bang in Shanghai with a lounge gun fight, directly followed up by a logic defying escape from a crashing plane using a rubber raft.  Awesome and exciting stuff.  The film doesn't slow down after that but it takes an extended break from the action.  We get to see locations, booby-traps, meet the villains, and gaze into the sets.  Once that's over we get the awesome mine-cart chase and a fist fight along a delapidated bridge above gator-invested waters.  Great stuff.  Some of the best action spectacles in the series next to the jeep chase in Raiders, the tank chase in Last Crusade, and the Amazon sword/jeep chase/killer ants attacking/machine gun blasting/monkey jumping scene from Krytal Skull.<br /><br />Also, and this may just be my personal prediliction, the film is just WEIRD.  The concepts are weird and way out there.  A lot of P.C. police deputies will complain about how the Indians are portrayed and how silly the dining scene it, but who takes these films that seriously?  It's called Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom for crying out loud!!!!  This is not a realistic culture and travel guide.  It's an excuse to add flavor and spectacle onto the preordained action sequences that all defy logic and plausability(Krystal Skull gets flack for the refrigerator scene, but no one has any problems with any mentioned action scenes in the previous three films).<br /><br />Basically, all four Indy films are the same in structure and tone.  The first two are darker, and the last two are liter, but only Temple of Doom breaks the Raiders structure.  They had the right idea, and as much as I enjoyed Last Crusade and Krystal Skull,I would've appreciated a constantly chaging structure and tone.  Once all the whiney parent police cried foul at this film(whining on the level of the loathed Willie Scott) Spielberg chickened out and stuck to the tried-and-true formula of Raiders, but further lightened up the proceedings.  I love this series and don't dislike any of the films in it.  Its truly one of the view films series that contains few flaws and stays true to its origins more so then most film series.<br /><br />Then there was all the unwarranted blasts against Krystal Skull.....Ah, maybe next time.mbe(DP on the first three Indy films).

B001MYIXAC|5.0|From the country that brought you Ingmar Bergman, Ikea, and the Noble prize, Sweden, comes an amazing horror film. The Vikings would be proud of this film! This one will put you on the edge of your seat and then scare the begeezes out of you. At the most simple level it is the vampire story. The new twist, the vampire is around 12 years old and the story takes place in the land of very long winter nights, Sweden.<br /><br />This is a fairly slow moving film with scare points put in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer interested or on their toes. The sound is just absolutely magnificent, ominous music exactly where necessary (not campy and over played), deep bass sounds that heighten the situation, and crunchy snow all add to the drama and suspense. The production is stark and simple, but with a certain style; exactly what you would imagine from Scandinavia. Photography is well done, cameras are steady where they should be, and there is no obvious mindless handheld camera work.<br /><br />The choice of 12 year olds for the vampire story seems, at first, to be a bit odd or wrong. But on reflection, the age fits rather well. The young boy, Oskar, is tormented by other kids. It's a common age where that can happen. There's an adult parallel that gets touched on with Eli, the vampire's caretaker or father (sorry, I'm not hugely well versed on the vampire myth so I don't know his exact role), and how he is bothered by the towns people at a restaurant. The whole layer of tormenting, is a wonderful addition to this story. Another film that deals with this very well is, [[ASIN:B001DYRL22 Ben X]] - although not in the horror film genre.<br /><br />The setting in Sweden is brilliant, in it's simple logic. Wouldn't vampires live where it's dark most of the time over half of the year? Well, there you have it, Sweden.<br /><br />It seems a series of bloody movies have come out of Scandinavia recently, [[ASIN:B001HVZO6Q Cold Prey]] being another example of the slower paced, more intellectual film.<br /><br />If you don't mind subtitles, and slightly slower, slightly less gory horror; this film is well worth seeing. It is almost 2 hours long. It could be maybe 10 or 15 minutes shorter with a bit of tightening up, otherwise it is the right length. I have purposely left off a discussion of the plot, except in the broadest terms. The viewer deserves to discover the twists and turns along the way.ced, more intellectual film.<br /><br />If you don't mind subtitles, and slightly slower, slightly less gory horror; this film is well worth seeing.

B001R0KH3M|5.0|Caution. That DVD could be addictive for you. Got it three days ago  and have looked it several times and can´t stop viewing and listening.  Fortunately I´m in holiday and weather isn´t so fine as its was the days before I purcchsed item.  The only thing I cant understand: I can hear all the small percussion (bells , chimes, shakers and all the stuff), but I´m not capable to hear   congas although I see the players playing them. Same with both guitars.  Can see them playing, but cant hear them only soloing. Is it as I have \\"only\\"a 2-chanell unit? But what a nonsense. Congas and guitars - coming from background?But what the heck-Listen and enjoy Stevie and his bandmates.  It´s unbeleivable. Party with auditions participation. Additional to many of Stevie´s masterpieces Jazztunes from Miles and the wellknown and beloved \\"Spain\\" fronm Chick Corea. Can´t stop praying it. So now i will return to my TV/Stereo to get more. Think I´m really addictive.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|If you suffer from insomnia - this might work for you. Complicated (needlessly for a comic book story). Desperately seeking meaning in a tired old franchise. Of course I have great respect for Chris Nolan, but this movie sucks. I never was a Heath Ledger fan, but his is a good performance and thus a silver lining in this cloud of a film. Way too long (are there no editors in Hollywood anymore?). I don't want to have to sit and concentrate over a Batman film. Boo!
B000WGZGNS|5.0|I'm a huge Beyonce fan! I purchased her DVD because I just bought a treadmill and I wanted to watch something that motivated me while I got my walk-out on!! So the first thought that popped into my mind was Beyonce LIVE in concert!! Her ENERGY is CrAzY!! the songs and the audience had me burning calories and singing along with her. No lip syncing, no boring moments.  Beyonce switched up the beat and style of her songs and gave them new twist!! She even sang Jill Scott \\"You Love Me\\"!! Bey will not disapoint.

B001DCQJ4A|5.0|This CD pleased me very much.First of all the Monteverdi choir is, today, one of the most impressive vocal ensembles . The Mendelssohn, in this CD , for a Capella choir , sounds magnificent. And the version of the superb Song of Destiny is one of the best I heard. The first three tracks are the sufficient reason to buy this record , but after we can hear one of the most beautiful versions available of the first Symphony of Brahms. The orchestra play so well, and the transparency, all the time ,make you hear things that simply don't appear in others versions.I am very happy to hear this CD, and I'm anxious to listen the others Symphonies. After the wonderful work with the Cantatas of Bach, the Monteverdi Choir and Gardiner, with this superb orchestra,shows once more the serious intentions of this new label.
0449000729|5.0|I stumbled upon Sarum accidentally while in an airport bookstore one day.  I'm glad I did.  I'm a fan of historical fiction, and I've read all of James Michener's works.  Edward Rutherford takes the same approach that Michener does: he focuses on one geographic area, and through a series of shorter stories, he takes us through the centuries via the adventures of the people who lived them.  The book is obviously exquisitely researched, and the characters all came alive for me.  (I found the telltale genetic traits to be a bit too cutesy after a while, but that's my only beef).    After Sarum, I was compelled to read the rest of Rutherford's books to date.  I look forward to his upcoming novel as he crosses the Atlantic to take on the history of New York.
B00000IMTF|4.0|rainbow rising is the second album by rainbow,by the time they started recording this album ritchie had replaced almost every band member that was on the debut album,with this new line up of; cozy powell-drums,tony carey-keyboards,jimmy bain-bass,ronnie dio-vocals and ritchie blackmore guitar genius..at the time of this incarnation of rainbow,ritchie and ronnie were into dabbling in the black arts..the mystical lyrics of songs like; stargazer,tarot woman,run with the wolf and light in the black reflect this dark fascination and rumour had it that when they were recording long live rock and roll,they were experiencing strange psychic phenomena..whether this is true or not i don,t know..but for a dio fan this album will take you to strange places...get it!!

B000002N2N|5.0|It's Alive pound for pound is one of the best live albums ever. The best album The Ramones ever put out. For all of you that have been Punk Rock fans for years or new to this genre of music you should have this album. This catches The Ramones back in 1977 in London, England. What away to bring in 1978 but to see the band perform on 12-31-77.
031606792X|5.0|I have spent the last two days reading the Twilight Saga for the first time.  I was attracted to the series after enjoying the film.  I must be clear that at the moment I am 38, and I agree with other reviewers that Breaking Dawn in particular seems to appeal to older readers.    Of all the books, my favourite one is Breaking Dawn and in particular, the final third where Bella makes her transformation.  The enjoyment for me is Stephenie Meyers' talented ability to draw you so completely into her narrative. I felt as though I was actually there when Bella changed and laughed at the wit in the next few paragraphs talking through her first hours.  I was sorry to see so little of Edward after her change, she became the complete focus and he and the rest of the Cullens became background.  Perhaps Ms Meyer will give us a bonus chapter of this period from Edwards perspective if and when she completes Midnight Sun.    So sorry, I don't agree with the negatives out there.  I thought Breaking Dawn was an excellent way of ending the series that was so compelling.  There are millions of books out there and as I grow older, I find it harder to find authors that I enjoy.  So many people have jumped on the Harry Potter bandwagon that a lot of weak stories are out there.  I am very glad I did not get into this series earlier and was able to enjoy all 4 in a row.  If you are looking for 2 solid days of laughs, tears and entertainment, you cannot go wrong with The Twilight Saga.  Every characters voice is strong and clear and in many cases laugh out loud funny.  I am looking forward to the remaining films too.
B001PNVYMO|5.0|I have been a fan of the PSB for 20 or so years and this is one of the most listenable albums they've done recently. I know they wrote many of the songs for Kylie Minogue but they do an awesome job with them. More pop than electronic this time around but it definitely works.
0517548232|5.0|Henry Hazlitt is amazing.  His ability to clearly communicate the natural forces of the market and how economics works - stripped of all the hoo haa of political bombast - is very easy to understand.  It's clear, concise, and as you read, you compare what he says to real life and you can see the truth of his words.  Every American should read this book right now.  We would have a different country, and an enormously prosperous one.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love this cd!  The songs are all fabulous and definitely fit the mood of the movie.  My favorite song is Decode by Paramore.  I could listen to it 100 times.  I would buy the CD for that song alone!  Get this CD or you will be missing out!
B00000AFDW|5.0|Every track was like a ballad. Every song was made to sound great, good solos good bass.
B001L5SXQG|1.0|The songs aren't bad but the production sucks big time. Just take a listen to Mrs Springsteen's last three albums to hear how it should be done. But of course she has the great Mike Campbell as producer and Bruce has to make do with Brendan who? One of her songs is \\"looking for Elvis\\" me i'm still looking for the real Bruce Springsteen!!!
B001IMFHTS|5.0|I will defer to Mr Morrison's previous review posted here for more details. This is an amazing deal for a complete Beethoven symphony cycle on DVD - $30 for a 4 DVD set! Great conductor/orchestra/audio recording and nice 16:9 widescreen, for those with newer TVs. A great aquisition for a new or discriminating collector - I am glad to own it.     But just a heads-up. This is a very different Beethoven and Berlin Philharmonic from the Karajan era. I mean almost a polar opposite extreme. Abbado has gotten into the whole newer performance practice of \\"fast and light\\" versus \\"slow and weighty\\". I am not judging here, just pointing it out. You will see/hear smaller orchestras, wooden flutes and lighter dynamics - more akin to Gardiner than Karajan. The whole thing is a little \\"nicer\\" than the Beethoven I am used to - but the trade-off is an incredible attention to detail and subtleties of dynamics.     The great thing about Beethoven is that it can really work with different approaches. So I recommend this set highly - but just know that it is only one approach to this essential repertoire. (Bernstein with the Vienna Phil is a good alternate)[[ASIN:B001DSR8NU Bernstein: Beethoven Symphonies Nos. 2, 6 & 7]] or for the \\"complete opposite\\" I mentioned earlier - Karajan [[ASIN:B000ANXLB2 Beethoven - The Symphonies Boxset / Herbert von Karajan, Gundula Janowitz, Christa Ludwig, Jess Thomas, Walter Berry, Berlin Philharmoniker]]
B001IAOEXU|5.0|So simple yet so effective.  They are made from hard, yet durable, plastic and snap securely over the triggers.  For months I puzzled over the PS3 controllers and struggled to reach the triggers, which on the SIXAXIS are recessed too much to find easily.  These things clip right on without damaging the original triggers and most importantly they do not reduce the 'throw' of the triggers in any way.<br />Highly recommended.
B000002LEE|5.0|Seriously... If you do not have this album you are missing out on one of the best.  Not limited to one of the best Jane's albums or early alternative punk albums, but on of the best albums... period.    The whole album has a great and intense vibe.  I bought this album back in 1991 while in college and it is still one of my top 5 favorites.

014006527X|5.0|When I read any worthwhile book, I write down memorable quotations in my Moleskine notebook in an attempt to fight the inevitable mental atrophy that comes as college recedes further into the rearview mirror. With this book, I wrote down over ten pages' worth--yes, it was that good, and there are so many choice phrases I despaired of trying to find a representative one and hope you will instead discover them for yourself. It was funny, it was painful, it satirized the British while also inspiring sympathy for any people out of place in a land not their own.<br /><br />I was slightly skeptical at how relevant a book about the British Empire could be sixty years after Indian independence, but like any great book, this one both evoked its time, and spoke with timeless lessons (and on second thought, a few decades is an eye-blink for one of the world's oldest civilizations). As long as we have different civilizations coming into conflict on this planet, this book should be required reading.

B00005OAA6|5.0|Why a Spice Girls would put out an R&B influenced album, but it does work and it sounds absolutely wonderful, the album are wonderfuly produced and Victoria Beckham comes off a totally new artist separate of her Posh Spice persona. My Favorite track is Midnight Fantasy, Not Such An Innocent Girl, Watcha Talkin About (I also loved the version with Missy Elliot) Girlfriend, and Mind of its Own. It truely makes me wonder what could have been of Mrs. Beckham's music career if her second album had been released.

B0012DOOF6|3.0|Straight Up this is a poor quality Russian import of the Beatles white LP. But tacked on the end are 25 super rare oddities? Not for everyone, for the most part It's just rehearsals but I almost feel like I know the lads on a more personal level after listening to these recordings. It's amazing to here George Harrison Pour his heart out on a songs that would later be dropped. I used to her about his frustration at the Beatles for not doing his material. Now I understand, to here the Beatles doing all things must pass and Not guilty 2 of Georges best only to stick on Lennon's revolution #9 on the white album instead. Now I can really Feel George's pain. But they did George a favor because those songs would later become staples for his solo efforts. I did not know that a lot of the best Solo work was rework stuff from the sessions of 1965 - 1968. And a lesson in song writing. First of all even the best writers may work on a piece for 10 years or more as in Lennon's child of nature. It's informative when they just blurt things out but the band keeps plying most of the ideas are bad but the best parts are kept and refined until you get the final version. Where did the Russians get this stuff?    A rundown on the extras included here!  1. Rocker - a short simple blues riff.  2. Save the last dance for me - which changes into don't let me down.  3. Maggie may - much like the released version.  4. Across the universe - with spacey sounds included.  5. I me mine - much like the released version.  6. Dig it - an early version of dig it poor quality practice session with lots of freelance. A rare example of Beatles writing style.  7. Can you dig it - A terrible version of dig it  8. Get back - A goofy version with almost no real lyrics but an interesting view of Beatles song writing.  9. All I want is you - A John Lennon original not that good  10. No Pakistanis - Another version of Get back still looking for lyrics.  11. Child of nature - A Lennon original that makes this purchase worth it. Lennon using the vocal line and music from a song that will become a Solo release jealous guy.  12. Every one had a hard year - Another early version of a song that would be a solo release.  13. The walk - Another unreleased Beatles original Raw but good  14. All things must pass - A version of the Beatles doing All things must pass A song that would later appear on George Harrison's solo album.  15. Get back - more goofing around very bad version.  16. Maxwell's silver hammer - an early version much like the final version. with a strange goofy end.  17. Octopus's garden - an early version much like the final version.   18. Come and get it - A very good quality copy of the Beatles version of the song that was given to bad Finger to record. An amazing example of what The Beatles gave away! I like this version better than bad fingers.  19. Ain't she sweet - a poor quality cover  20. Something - An early version of a George Harrison song. With a cool lost verse!  21. Old brown shoe - much like the released version.  22. All things must pass - An early version of a George Harrison song.   23. The end - Later to become the end of a day in the life  24. Hey Jude - much like the released version.  25. Not guilty - An early version of a George Harrison song.  With a really cool guitar lead at the end.
0446579939|5.0|Just finished the book today. Couldn't wait to review. It's my most favorite Sparks novel yet, though it will be difficult for A Walk to Remember to take second place to it. The Lucky One is so beautifully written. Sparks is the perfect example of an author who can write as beautifully about internal human shortcomings as well as external. Perfect balance of conflict and satisfying, realistic ending. The character centered drama, when well written, can surpass all other styles. Romance is my favorite and Nicolas Sparks is at the top of my list. Can't wait for more.  __Ana__
B00005AFVR|5.0|This is the best cd that they put out ,its great, you should see the DVD its better;;
B001EZ78T6|4.0|To whoever produced this CD:    Please consider putting ane extended version of \\"It's Over\\" on vinyl. A very nice groove that will sell well (just better fidelity on vinyl ... will transfer to enhanced CD using hardware). Hope you thought of this by now...If you haven't, please emphasize the chorus, which completely makes this cut.
B000002U82|5.0|Forget all those people who have rated this under five stars. They are not to be trusted. What Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Rick Wright and Nick Mason achieved is of such brilliance it's even silly to review it. So I won't. I'm glad there's no light whatsoever on the dark side of the moon because then we should be able to contemplate the whole universe from there. All stars would be shining as bright as they could just like the music on this album does.
0679731725|5.0|After reading Ishiguro's amazing writing, I am humbled to be writing a review of the book.  For those who are considering whether to bother with this book, a word of warning:  not much happens in it. There are no murders, surprises, sex, romance or mystery. Actually, there is romance but it is subtle which makes the book a lot richer.<br /><br />The prose is clear, simple and incredibly beautiful. Mr. Stevens, the protagonist is Lord Darlington's butler who reminisces about his career during 1920's and 1930's England when fascism, Germany's economic collapse, America's rise and anti-Semitism where issues of the day. The beauty of this book is its simplicity and look into human nature. While the discussions are about butlers, the thoughts are applicable to virtually to everyone. The author does an impeccable job developing Steven's character which becomes very real and convincing early on in the book. If you are in the mood for great writing and thought provoking prose, you will be dazzled by this book. Highly recommended for the reader with the right expectations.
B001E2JNA6|3.0|First of all, this movie is fantastic, but I'm not going to review that. We already own the special edition DVD release and purchased the movie on blu-ray because the only thing better than all of that taffeta and lace is seeing it in excruciating detail. Unfortunately, despite the extensive restoration process, it is still clearly not up to blu-ray quality. Here are the pros and cons:  pros: The color looks a lot better than the DVD release, and the detail is clearer. The 2 discs fit into a standard size blu-ray case, so it takes up less room than the DVDs.  cons: There is only so much that they can do. There are still artifacts (albeit smaller than in the DVDs) which made me think we'd accidentally loaded a reel of film instead of a disc. Additionally, in the upconversion process, the images are sharper, but they're also really grainy. It felt like an upconverted DVD simply transfered in a different format, though in fairness, it's still better than a straight upconversion. This is an older film, so it will never look like the new movies that are being released on blu-ray.  In short, don't have unrealistic expectations. This is an improvement, but it doesn't have the clarity of picture that you would typically expect from a blu-ray disc. If you're hoping for a more beautiful cinematographic experience with the story, maybe wait until the 2006 adaptation is released on blu-ray. The BBC version trumps in characterization & accuracy to the manuscript, but the picture quality still isn't there.
0756405890|5.0|I love to read, which is a good thing since the majority of what I am reading now is are textbooks. But The Name of the Wind is probably the best book I have read in the past 5 years. I am a student, and a musician, and found getting absorbed in the storyline easy and exciting. I am looking forward to reading more from Patrick Rothfuss.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|I purchased this film expecting to love it.  Instead, I found it a terribly depressing tale about man's habitual pattern of self-abuse, environmental destruction and abandonment.  There is no clever dialog to engage the viewer, indeed, there is very little dialog at all.  Wall-E is an adorable little robot who has been left behind to clean up the catastrophic mess that has covered Earth, while all the remaining humans travel about space in a perpetual holding pattern, eating themselves into deformity.  I cannot fathom what the other 700 some odd viewers who loved this movie found to love about it.
B001P3SA94|3.0|Decent movie. Due to the number of characters in the movie didn't really detail any one artist (Muddy was nearest). Hopefully biopics will sprout focusing on the individual artist like Howlin Wolf or Muddy, but I doubt it, they are not as $exy as a David Bowie or Rolling Stones. The best thing about this movie other than it was made is the fact it was less than 2 hours, which these days is a god send. Movies nowadays have a nasty habit of being to damn long.<br /><br />If you love this music and the Chess era it would be easy to knock this film but let's just be satisfied knowing that at least mainstream media/society has acknowledged (at least somewhat) the influence these people had on nearly all the music after them.
B00005JN8Z|4.0|A joy to watch, fairly accurate historically speaking (plenty of touches of artistic freedom to tie everything tightly together). Somewhere about 2.5 hours in runtime.<br /><br />\\"Quo Vadis\\" or \\"where are you going\\" titled that to reference the biblical scripture and thematic concept for a purposeful Christian living so to be rewarded in the afterlife. Although scripted with Christian piety the movie is highly secular.<br /><br />Synopsis: Weary Roman Commander and his Legion return after a campaign in Britain. His lustful eye catches a strawberry blonde \\"hostage\\" of the state. He arranges, to her displeasure, to have her granted as his custodian. The problem is she is a Christian and he being a pagan and heathen must change his ways if she were to love him (and she wants to in some bizarre way, but it's a move, eh?). Well he does eventually but through the course of their relationship's web is the Emperor Nero and his evil Empress, Petronius the wise council (the commander's uncle), Paul and Peter (yes, those Paul and Peter) and a few others. The premise is that one should be and do good, because what goes around comes around. At least that's the secular premise. The Christian one is that God has a plan and one should have faith in Jesus teachings (etc). If you like old school Hollywood spectacles (and this was the first of biblical proportions) or Ancient Rome (Deborah Kerr is a looker see:Black Narcissus), watch this. Great writing, great directing, and great acting (especially Nero, who may make me buy this film, to re-watch his most entertaining performance...poetry and has never been so vain...).
B00005JKDR|5.0|Our previous copy of Monsters, Inc was so scratched that it kept skipping or just stopping when the kids tried watching it.  I finally got a new copy and my kids plus the kids in my daycare can't get enough!!!  We watch it on average 3 times a week...it gets quite a workout!  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
B001HZK8FO|5.0|A wonderful addition to any collection.The HiDef sound helps bring this love story to life even more.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|I have to say, when I first heard about this I was unsure. Then I Picked it up and listened to it. Well, not really what I had in mind, but I like quite a few of the tracks. Especially, Scream. When you listen to something and it sticks with you for a few days, thats a good thing. Now, after seeing him  live this last week for this tour. Chris Cornell does not disappoint. He succesfully merges the old and the new. They pulled out Soundgarden, Temple Of The Dog, Audioslave (My favorite)and his solo stuff with great success. With the guys he has in his band, I see no reason for a reunion of sorts with either of the old projects. I would rather hear it all. All in all, did he deviate from the stuff he is known for, yes. But hey, he wanted to try something new and I think he pulls it off just fine. If you follow his career, he is always shifting gears. See him live and it will be a show you remeber. After all, he is an artist. Artists always do something different.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Kate Winslet is amazing in this film, establishing herself as one of the great actresses of all time.  Ralph Feinnes and David Cross were incredible, too.  Other reviewers have reviewed it well, so I won't repeat their praises, though I certainly second them. My nickel's worth is here in simple appreciation for a wonderful movie.  Highly recommend it.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I'm a Business major I bought this calculator for my finance class.  It's all I thought It would be and more!   First I was confused trying to choose between the Platinum and the regular 12c but I'm happy I went for the platinum.  Some people might say it's not as good because it's not the original 12c but it just needs some getting used to.  I love the extra features it has like backspace, Algebraic mode and comparing it to the regular 12c this one is way faster on giving you the final results.  Absolutely love it!
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Very few films I've seen (made in the last decade or so, at least) rightly deserve the adjective compelling. So many deliver either a skillfully-crafted plot or singular performances by a certain actor or an ensemble cast, but seldom does the combination of both cinematic aspects meld to form a truly amazing movie. Doubt, written and directed by John Patrick Shanley, delivers the exception to the rule, and the result is a miracle to behold.    I won't divulge many specifics because Doubt is a creature that must be experienced without much foreknowledge in order to be fully appreciated. The setting is a Roman Catholic grade school, St. Nicholas, located in the Bronx; the year is 1964. The protagonist is a Sister of Charity, S. Aloysius, who is the school's principal as well as the superior of the convent. Rev. Brendan Flynn is the curate (assistant priest) of St. Nicholas Church.    Suffice it to say the two are at odds over most everything--but usually in a subdued, intellectual manner. Sister Aloysius is stern and old-fashioned; Father Flynn is relaxed and progressive. Meryl Streep is unforgettable as the principal; one can scarcely imagine any other actress breathing such forceful life into the role. Ms. Streep can infuse the tiniest act--the raising of an eyebrow, a murmured \\"hmm\\"--with oceans of disdain and derision as no other actress today. Philip Seymour Hoffman, a character actor who has justifiably garnered a reputation for his considerable talent, delivers a nuanced performance as the priest.    Another great talent is the fresh-faced Amy Adams, who plays Sister James, a young nun who is neatly--and regrettably--thrust between the two leads and their duelling philosophies of education and spirituality.     This is a thinking film. Based on the play which Shanley wrote, it is incredibly dialogue-driven, but the pacing is impeccable. From the first syllable of Father Flynn's homily at the outset of the storyline the viewer is drawn in as the leads contend inexorably with one another until one of them proves victorious.     One of the many questions the viewer will come away with after watching is: Who won? And at what cost?     Anyone who has seen this movie will tell you: \\"I believed X\\"; the crux of the drama evolves from suspicion and self-defense on the part of the nun and the priest toward one another. The polarization of opinion should lead to intense discussion among viewers. Be assured this film will appeal to a wide audience; it is not solely fixated on the Catholic Church, although those familiar with Catholicism will perhaps comprehend more fully some of the themes and issues raised in the plot. At its core Doubt speaks to sweeping concepts applicable to everyone: faith and faithlessness, optimism and pessimism, mercy and justice, right and wrong.     A gross travesty of the 2009 Oscars was that this phenomenal piece didn't receive a single gold statue (it was, however, nominated for five of them).    I invite the reader to obtain a copy and examine the credibility of Doubt.
B001P9KR94|5.0|I just watched \\"Slumdog millionaire\\" and was definitely impressed by the movie. Since I am originally from India so, I am aware of most of what is shown in the movie. So this might have taken away some of the impact that Boyle tries to deliver.<br /><br />Is the movie Oscar worthy? I would say, it deserved oscars for 7 out of the 8 categories except for best picture(which I thought The reader should have won).Danny Boyle has done a wonderful job in directing this movie and has captured a slice of India very well. The screenplay and the writing is terrific and the scenes seamlessly fit in the plot. Some people feel that he has wrongly portrayed India as a poor country. But as a film maker he has a right to choose a segment of India and make a movie about it. Yes, what you see only part of Indian life.India is a country where there are palaces and slums side by side. When someone makes a movie about King kakaka with lavishing palaces etc, no one would complain about the movie wrongly portraying India as such a rich country.<br /><br />A.R.Rahman has done a wonderful job, as usual. A lot of people feel that this is not his best work and he has done better. But we are talking about the original score here and NOT the actual songs. The score certainly delivered the knock out punch and had a tremendous impact throughout the movie. As far as the best song goes, yes Rahman has done better. But \\"Jai ho\\" was the perfect feel good song to finish off the climax. The academy was definitely unjust towards Bruce Springsteen for not nominating the song from \\"The Wrestler\\". Among the nominations \\"Jai ho\\" certainly deserved the honor.<br /><br />Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Irfan Khan and Anil Kapoor have done a good job but nothing spectacular. The real stellar performances come from the kids who really set up this movie to stand tall.<br /><br />Overall, a great movie by Danny Boyle!
0316776963|5.0|It's the old dave at best. This book is for anyone with a decent sense of humor who enjoys a good heart being spilled out into text.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I wanted to see this movie when it came out in the theaters, but didn't.  So I read some of the reviews on here and decided to rent it via Red Box for $1 and I'm so VERY glad I did!  OH MY GOSH!  This movie has humor, drama, romance, sadness, and everything and anything else you can think of!  It is a shame that Hollywood no longer makes movies this great!  They didn't have to use horror, gross, gruesome images or even a lot of cussing!  I highly recommend this movie to buy, don't waste your money renting it, just BUY IT!
1591841992|4.0|If you're someone who needs to cast vision for others (leaders, sales force, teachers, trainers) then this book is for you.  If you have a vision, but you're struggling to get others to capture a passion for it this resource may help you begin to bridge the divide.  It is especially for folks who say, \\"I can't draw.\\"  That probably means you're not oriented to visual input, but a large percentage of the population is.  Get this book and apply the principles to see your connections increase.  Pictures are persuasive!
B001N18HOQ|3.0|Ten. The album that launched a musical of force of such enormity, it is unstoppable.  Who knew that Pearl Jam would be the last surviving band from the grunge era still standing, touring, and making tons of coin. That said, we have this reissue of the classic Ten album. Like with many reissues, get this one if you can't find your original copy of Ten. Or, get it if you are slightly curious. In any case, the DVD of the unplugged performance is the only reason to get this reissue. Apart from that, Pearl Jam is just cashing in (like so many bands) on their back-catalogue.

038572179X|5.0|Atonement is on of my all-time favorite books, both to read for pleasure and to use in the classroom. It is powerful, engaging for both males and females, and excellent from a historical context. The film adaption is great, as well. The only thing to worry about is the use of language in the book, as some might find it offensive.

0312383320|5.0|Diesel, the supernatural bounty-hunter, is back and this time he and Stephanie Plum are looking for Wulf Grimoire, an unmentionable with plans for world domination, and Martin Munch, a twenty-four year old physicist with non-existent social skills.    The Stephanie Plum \\"between-the-numbers\\" novels must really be popular, since \\"Plum Spooky\\", the latest in this sub-series, is more than twice the length of its three predecessors (\\"Plum Lucky\\", \\"Plum Lovin'\\" and \\"Visions of Sugar Plums\\"), clocking in at approximately the same length as one of the full-length \\"numbers\\" books. This is, without a doubt, my favourite Stephanie Plum book to date, largely because it is the silliest. With \\"Plum Spooky\\", Evanovich has completely given up on trying to place her story in the real world, and as a result, we are treated to the adventures of Carl the cartoon-esque monkey (he watches television, eats pizza and makes offensive hand gestures - isn't that what real monkeys do?), the Jersey Devil (New Jersey's answer to the Loch Ness Monster) and Elmer the Fire-Farter (yes, you read that right). If you can't cope with the idea of a character who farts fire whenever he eats spicy food (and at other inconvenient times), then don't waste your time or money on this book, you'll hate it, but if you find that sort of thing funny, then, for you, this might be the best Plum ever.

B001GQACGO|5.0|its beyonce what can i say. i love the album, i have a few that i still dont listen to but give me a bit. when i bought the 2nd destiny child album there were a couple of songs i couldnt stand but lol after a couple of years i gave them a chance after listening to my music in the shuffle position. this current album i like because beyonce took a chance with a sound that she has only skimmed before on a few unreleased tracks ive heard a few years ago. i wish she had a few more sasha fierce songs on the album. i hate that everyone has a problem with the whole sasha fierce thing. its just a personality and if you are a singer then you can understand the persona that takes over you when your on stage or at church. lol cuts i love are of course the singles, i cant believe halo doesnt get much radio play here. i love scared of lonely, broken hearted girl, hello, why dont you love me...you know what let me go this route. i dont care for save the hero, and thats why youre beuatiful. Yet.

B00005614M|3.0|3 1/2    Disengaged from all the album has come to represent (I refuse to base ratings on historical context and can only honor emotional resonance as a guide), it's an easy going but quality-driven big band mild alternative which does stay rooted in the expected, but does so with enough grace and grit to keep things worthwhile. One can only imagine how cool it would have been though, to witness this actual birth as it arrived.
0156421178|5.0|This book is THEE Spanish Civil War book, as far as I'm concerned. I read it with the hopes of getting an idea of what the Spanish Civil War was about, because it was very confusing to me. But it seems that Orwell wrote the book with the purpose of dispelling the confusion. He simply tells his account, and, through his experiences, I was able to learn about the war. I learned what he did in the war, the group he was part of, the other organizations, and what the outcome was for him.    There is more to the story than what I am writing about. But what I wrote is good enough for me to enjoy it.
1596912863|4.0|Being a JA fan I'm always on the lookout for a creative take on Miss Austen's work.  Some are cringeworthy, others are fantastic; fortunately, Austenland by YA author Hale falls closer to the latter end of the spectrum.  It is built on the brilliant conceit that, somewhere in England, there is an historic recreation of Jane Austen's world, replete with Empire waists and haughty gentlemen, which caters to the whims of an exclusive clientele.  Jane Hayes has entered this rarefied fantasy due to the largesse of a dead aunt, and Hale's witty dialogue and talent for humor add up to a rollicking, if necessarily genteel, holiday from her abysmal love life.  Chapters open with a take on Jane's succession of bad boyfriends, and these help fill out our perception of the heroine.  Well written and fun, this is a fast read, a literary chocolate-covered marshmallow marred only by a hurried and muddled ending that should not detract overmuch from this fun romp through Austenland.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|Due to the untimely death of Richard Wright, there is next to no chance that there will a Pink Floyd reunion anytime soon. But don't fret, because David Gilmour's latest solo release, On An Island, will certainly quench the thirst for Pink Floyd fans old and new.<br /><br />The trademarks are all there: The reflective and emotional mood, breathy sound effects, special effects seguing into another track, and of course, the voice and powerful guitar solos of David Gilmour. But there are some tricks on this album that are anything but Floyd, such as the R&B flavored \\"This Heaven,\\" which is the jazziest thing Gilmour's ever created.<br /><br />The album's first half is some of Gilmour's best work. The title track contains gorgeous harmonies by 2/3 of CS&N, The Blue feels like a dream, Take A Breath is reminiscent of The Wall-era Floyd, and tracks such as Red Sky At Night (with Gilmour on sax) and Then I Close My Eyes shows David in experimental mode, not afraid to change his personal style or his music.<br /><br />Unfortuantly, the last few songs fall flat. Smile is a little on the campy side, and A Pocketful Of Stones is incredibly dull, something you would hear on a later-era Moody Blues album. Where We Start picks up steam near the end, but one would feel that if he ditched the last 3 songs and wrote some stronger material with, say, Richard Wright, it would be a much more satisfying album.<br /><br />All complaints aside, On An Island is a very good album by a man who really doesn't need to prove himself anymore, and that's saying something. Reccomended for fans of The Division Bell, or any Floyd albums after Dark Side.
0143038419|5.0|I briefly skimmed a few of the positive and negative reviews on here. It seems the negative ones really missed the point of the book. If you want to read a strictly travel-related essay, go elsewhere; a book on Rome, or a reflection on meditation, look to another book.<br /><br />If you've seen the author on Oprah (and chances are if you hated the book, you wouldn't watch that to start with) and the author talks about the problems that intermingling her identity too much with her relationships to such a great degree has caused her, and how that has been counterproductive to her happiness.<br /><br />Has she found her ideal mate in Felipe? I think that's for her to decide. Does that fact, unbeknownst to me, really change my experience of reading the book and seeing the value in her articulated personal explorations? Based on my reading of the book - it was exactly that - a personal exploration comprised of many elements. It might be \\"selfish\\" of her, but obviously, if you read between the lines you see how a lot of the seeming \\"unselfish\\" choices she had made were making her miserable. If you can't figure out how to make yourself happy, how can you be truly valuable to anybody else?

B001N26GFC|5.0|I have a hard time explaining to others why Mike Leigh is among my favorite directors.  His films don't have brilliantly complex plots or uniquely beautiful visual style or many of the other traits that most people associate with great directors.  He is, however, an excellent scriptwriter - he's created several of the most intriguing characters in cinema - and an excellent director of actors.  But even that doesn't really explain why he would be among my favorite directors - and I don't know how to explain it, other than to say that his films impact me on a gut level.  I find them tremendously moving and moral and beautiful.  They make me laugh and they make me cry.  I can understand why some find his style of \\"social realism\\" to be boring, but to me they are far from boring or simple.  In fact, few films involve me and move me as much as his.      \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" is another masterpiece from Mike Leigh.  As with most of his films, there is no real villain, and not much of a plot - but it is still very funny, and very moving.  It may be among his most simple efforts, but it is far from shallow - as with all of his films, the sometimes mundane events of the plot hide complex and profound truths.  Sally Hawkins is marvelous as Poppy, who is, depending on the viewer, one of the most endearing or one of the most annoying characters to appear in quite some time depending on the viewer.  Eddie Marsan is equally fantastic as her bitter, conspiracy theorist driving instructor.      It's not exactly a feel-good comedy as some of the advertisements (and DVD menus) will have you believe - but it is ultimately a positive film, that may just reaffirm your faith in humanity.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Billy Elliot is one of the most inspiring movies of all times!  From the opening titles, as we watch Billy (Jamie Bell) expressing pure joy through movement, to the rolling credits at the end of the movie, where we have experienced the joy of dance through the heart and soul of a poor and grieving boy, my fantasy is that most viewers are jumping around the room, remembering how good it felt to dance before we became self conscious.  The acting is superb, the writing is superb, the story is engrossing and transformative.  Watch this movie if you need a lift, an inspiration to move, or if you just want to have a joyful experience.  The supporting cast, Billy's hard working father and brother, who have given their lives to the mines, and his demented grandmother, who \\"could have been a professional dancer\\" steal our hearts too.
B000W91RUG|1.0|I wish I could like this show -- I mean, my life would be so much better if my standards were that low. I'd be able to watch the Late Show with Jimmy Fallon without flinching; I'd be able to enjoy Ben Affleck's nuanced performance in Gigli; I might even be able to listen to the chorus of a John Mayer song without chundering (wait a minutes, now I'm going overboard). The possibilities are endless.     Unfortunately for The Big Bang Theory, I retain a capacity to discern quality from crap. This show feels written by non-geeks who sent a couple of PA's to the comic book store to bring back a few superhero comics, and felt empowered after reading them to write geek dialogue.    The producers are more concerned about seeing how many outfits they can get Kaley Cuoco into per episode than writing plausible characters. It gets one star because she's hot but otherwise...no, thanks.
B0000DESLW|5.0|14 tracks of nothing short of excellence. 3 studio albums way too short of this duos career.<br /><br />It's self-explanatory here. Look at the track listing. What hit is missing by Wham! here? You also have the 12\\" version remix of \\"Everything She Wants\\" among everything else. George & Andrew, God bless you both for giving us the good, the bad and a short-lived, one disc of THE FINAL because Wham! maybe over but the Wham! jams will never leave.<br /><br />No more need to write about it, just get it.
B001KQ4KCW|1.0|This book is about a 9year German boy, who remains oblivious, against all odds, to the nature of a concentration camp that he can view from his bedroom window.  It could almost have been written by a 9 year old boy, and is certainly suitable  of writing style or nuance.  The prose plods doggedly on, never missing a chance to repeat such phrases as my \\"sister is a Hopeless Case\\".         The banality of this novel can hardly be overstated.
B001ILFUDM|4.0|This film transfers beautifully to Blu-Ray format, and is representative of how animation was created in the Golden Era. I am hoping this means we will get more Classic Disney animated films in the future. I can rattle off a lot of techno speak, but this film is a major romp in the old style.

B001PPLIFU|5.0|The new Bond movies with Daniel Craig are excellent. They show the evolution of Bond from a \\"Blunt Instrument\\" to a suave international spy (to come in future installments, I'm sure). For this Blu-Ray transfer, the picture is gorgeous -- one of the best of the bunch out there. The sound is ear crunching -- in a good way. The scenery is mesmerizing. The plot is a bit too intricate for me, but the action stunts are extremely exciting, and filmed in \\"real time\\" with no, or minimal CGI effects work. Kudos all around - this series outdpaces the originals by far!!
B001IAOEXU|4.0|These were cheap, easy to install, and took care of the problem they are designed to fix.  Unfortunately the PS3 controller doesn't appear to have been designed for an adult with normal to large hands.      This mod helped out a lot.
B001QTMRXM|4.0|Delain's second album, 'April Rain', is a solid, satisfying release, though I do have to agree with the other reviewers who said that it is not quite up to par with their fist album 'Lucidity'. Of course, part of what made that album so great was the presence of famous names from the symphonic metal community (Sharon Den Adel from Within Temptation, Liv Kristine from Leaves' Eyes, Marco from Nightwish... what's not to love?!)<br /><br />Upon first listening to 'April Rain', I must confess that I was somewhat disappointed to hear that the band have not retained the symphonic-metal sound that I loved in their first album. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure they would still be classed in that genre, but gone are the choirs and soaring melodies: this album presents a more conventional 'rock' sound.<br />Still, that being said, there is a lot to like about 'April Rain' - I can't stop listening to it, in fact. Each track has its own unique charm. Marco even makes an apprerance on this album as well - always a plus.<br />Charlotte is a passionate singer, and a lot of fun to listen to.<br /><br />'April Rain' is a very nice opening track, with a pretty intro, a pleasant chorus, and some great guitar work.<br />'Stay Forever' has grown on me a fair bit, and 'Invidia' showcases some excellent music, I must say.<br />'Control the Storm', featuring Marco, is also very enjoyable, and satisfyingly heavy.<br />'On the Other Side' is a softer song that makes me want to sing along (albeit poorly.)<br />'Virtue and Vice' is quite a powerful track, and the only one to feature the band's growler (alas - I think they should use him more!)<br />'Go Away' is also a very enjoyable song, and is probably the most symphonic-sounding track present: quite reminescent of the sound of 'Lucidity'.<br />'Start Swimming' is a rather unconvential-sounding song. I didn't quite know what to make of it at first, but now I like it a lot - it adds a nice diversity to the album.<br />The last three tracks, I must admit, don't jump out at me quite as much as the others. Perhaps I just need to listen to them a bit more.<br />In conclusion, 'April Rain' is a good, solid, approachable album by a very talented female-fronted symphonic rock band. Certainly worth owning.the others. Perhaps I just need to listen to them a bit more.

B001PA0FFO|1.0|I bought this movie because Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actresses.  But the film scared the h out of me.  To be around such a weird and fearful person in charge of children made me very glad I'm not a Catholic and never went to a Catholic school. I had a few mean teachers in my time, but never anything like her. Streep played the part perfectly for one of those overly fanatic religious people who think they know it all.  But the whole theme of the film, the suspicion, the cruelty, of a teacher whose in charge of children, upset me so much, I had to finally turn it off.      After a while, I turned it back on.  It was still playing, and it was near the end.  Then I saw that cruel nun crying because of the fact that she might have been wrong by trying to ruin a priests career, and who knows about the boy? That part was totally unbelievable.  In reality, she would have been proud of what she had done, as most fanatics are when things go their way. It made me so mad, that I threw the film in the garbage where it belonged.      First of all the movie was supposed to be in the early 60's where no one ever would have accused a priest of pedophilia!  Out of the question.  This never came up until the 90's when a few brave boys spoke up.  And even then, it took years for anyone to believe them, or the church to do anything about it, much less the civil authorities.   Rev. Law of Boston, who covered up the crimes of his pedophile priests holds a high position in Rome today.  The Church didn't care one wit. And they still don't or Law would have been excommunicated, and sitting in a jail cell in Boston along with those priests he was protecting.    I have no sympathy for a paranoid teacher whose in charge of children.  She should not have been placed in a school. She belonged in a mental institution. Beyond that, the priest did absolutely nothing to even cause any such doubt.  Should any nice priest or the kind father of a child be considered a molester?  I think a manwould go out of his way to not act suspicious.  Rather this priest was simply being nice and helpful to a kid who felt out of his place.  I guess nice priests are not acceptable in the Catholic church.  But wasn't it Jesus who said \\"Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.\\" Perhaps the Catholic Church doesnt' accept Jesus' beliefs just the Church's beliefs. Certainly this nun didn't. A priest can be kind without being a pedophile. And a difficult priest can, in fact, be one.     Meryl Streep is a great actress and played the part of the evil, destructive nun to a T. One of her best acting jobs since Sophie's Choice.  But I hated the film, and I'm sorry she played that role.
B00005NRN9|3.0|The very successfull Cirque Du Soleil decided to lately present its talent on a short film rather than their traditional public show. It was nice watching it on film, however I have the following remarks:     Pros: Very colorfull, talented, nice sountrack, and entertaining.     Cons: Very short (30-45 mins), no story, and lacks singing. I guess it would have been much nicer if it was a musical, such as Moulin Rouge. It could have been a romantic story with some singing and lots of their talented acrobatic shows.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|This is a well produced and well played yet a boring record that will put you to sleep. Where is Diana Krall jazz pianist and singer?  A pitty I purchased this CD, heard it once and not again.  Sorry but this is the way I feel.

B000002KBU|5.0|But you knew that.......if sparse, personal, intimate, emotional music is what you crave, this is it....Hejira is my favorite Joni album, but this is a close second. This album is for the person that likes -    Tea for the Tillerman - Cat Stevens  Grace - Jeff Buckley  Sweet Baby James - James Taylor  Solitude Standing - Suzanne Vega  Tapestry - Carole King  Time in a Bottle - Jim Croce  Bookends - Simon and Garfunkel    Obviously this is a small list but Joni and Laura Nyro were at the forefront of confessional singer-songwriter albums. This is one of the best in that genre. Buy it but don't wear it out. Might be too depressing.....
1416562605|4.0|A terrific view of the less pleasant side of India;  the vast chasm between extreme wealth and desperate impoverishment, the omnipresent corruption, the filth.  The novel is presented as a series of letters from an Indian to the Premier of China, explaining the Indian's life.  India has democracy, but in his view, clean water and sanitary handling of sewage would  be greater priorities. Given the details of the story, it's difficult not to agree.  An excellent read with valid political points.
B000002KCI|5.0|Zuma is essentially \\"Everybody Knows\\" part 2, which is a little odd, considering that there are 5 albums in between. I was really excited when I first bought this in the mid 70's, knowing that there was the potential to hear Neil break out the loud and majestic guitar solos again. I was not disappointed. \\"Dangerbird\\" is the second cut, very long, very reminiscent of early Crazy Horse. I knew that Neil was back at this point. But all of the cuts on this album are awesome. The second half of the album is prime N.Y., as he shreds through \\"Drive Back\\" (check out the ridiculously loud \\"flying V\\" guitar parts), \\"Cortez the Killer\\" (the build up before the vocals on this song has to be cranked up volume-wise to fully appreciate the passion and glory that is Neil when he decides to make a point with his guitar), and the album ends with the beautiful C,S,N and Y tune \\"Through my Sails\\". You cannot find this song on any other album. Any respectable Neil fanatic already has burned through about 10 copies of \\"Zuma\\", but maybe it's time for copy #11. Or if it is your first copy, enjoy it and play it back to back with \\"Everybody Knows....\\". The electric guitar was INVENTED for these 2 albums and Neil's fingers. Buy both albums and wear them out along with your speakers and your neighbors..........
B000000OPZ|1.0|This album is the most blatant example of \\"selling out\\" that could ever be presented for your consideration.<br /><br />I can understand wanting to make money, but I wish that David Coverdale had been more like Ayn Rand's character Howard Roarke!  The recognition that his original style deserved would have come in time - I'm certain of that, considering the revival of blues and blues rock that occurred in the 90's.<br /><br />Please try not to hold this music against Coverdale and the many talented musicians he worked with prior to it.<br /><br />Check out the Slide It In album and anything earlier (such as Love Hunter, Snakebite, etc.).
B00008G9JM|5.0|It was years ago but Ian Anderson said that this was his favorite Tull album. Need I say more, Tullsters? It is my favorite as well. I saw the complete performance of this piece of genius at the L.A. Forum in July of 1973. J.T. played the entire album beginning to end and in the middle \\"intermission\\" section played the movie \\"The Hare....\\" great show. After playing Passion Play for 45 minutes and receiving a roaring ovation, Ian said \\"Thanks so much, I thank you, and now for our second number\\"....and then launched into Thick as a Brick, the entire album as well. Back to back 40 minute-plus pieces of music to open a concert. That doesn't happen very often.....encore was Cross-Eyed Mary, Aqualung and a very long Wind Up, which included Ian leaving the stage for a well-deserved break and Martin Barre ripping off power chords and jamming with the band for a good 6 to 7 minutes. This jam was amazing and parts of it ended up on Minstrel in the Gallery (especially on the middle section of the title cut). All of that Tull magic played for hours. Steeleye Span was the opening act, excellent set. Passion Play is so complex and wonderful. For a brief period of time, Ian and Co. proved that they could more than hang with the prog heavyweights of the day. This was sadly their last \\"prog concept\\" album. I wish they would have continued in this vein for a few more releases considering how great they were at doing these albums. Buy this today and wear it out.....\\"we sleep by the ever-bright hole in the door, eat in the corner, talk to the floor\\"......
B000VZYUN2|5.0|This is really good, solid British blues rock!  This album and its predecessors brought a lot of good musicians to the table, some well known and others relatively unknown.  Coverdale really was a unique and talented songwriter and singer and oh, how I love what Jon Lord brings to any band he is a part of! Although this album is a little more polished than their earlier work, you will still find slide guitar and fun, sexy lyrics instead of the sappy 80's anthems and ballads that Coverdale started dredging out later - what a tragic waste of talent in my opinion!<br /><br />It would be nice if we could rewrite history just a little so that this would really be the last Whitesnake album.  As a young teenager who loved this album and therefore, ran out and bought all of their older albums and learned an entirely new outlook on music, it was heartbreaking to see what they later became.  I could no longer even tell anyone they were my favorite band because no one else around me knew about their TRUE music and I didn't want to be misunderstood!  Eventually it actually became a stigma to be known as a Whitesnake fan (after all the people who loved the 80's \\"hair bands\\" finally turned against them - I never liked that whole scene to begin with!).  Thus, what was once a great band never had a chance to be recognized for their past accomplishments, which were truly noteworthy.<br /><br />If you want to find out what Whitesnake was REALLY all about, listen to Slide It In, Love Hunter, Come An' Get It, etc.  They are well worth a listen!
B00005NTJK|5.0|Most Tullsters have this one, but if you don't.......\\"With you there to help me\\" is one of their greatest tunes ever. It's worth listening to if only for the flute-echoing-down-from-the-mountains intro, which was a tape loop of Ian's flute played backwards. Glenn Cornick, with the long hair, knee-high boots and Indian headband, didn't just look cool, he basically defined cool. His bass playing on \\"Nothing to Say\\", especially backing up Ian's voice on the verses, is nothing short of amazing. In those days, you actually had bassists playing as the lead instrument. McCartney, Entwhistle, Bruce and certainly Glenn. \\"Sossity\\" is beautiful and I really miss Ian's love songs. They are always so sincere and heartfelt. I feel that this album has to be in the top 3 or 4 that J.T. ever recorded. There is not one weak tune on this album. Buy it and wear it out.....if you would really like to hear and enjoy early Tull, get the DVD \\"Living with the Past\\". The original line-up plays a small mini-concert of their old tunes from the 1st album. Nice to see all of them healthy and having a good time.......and yes, Clive once again has a bit of a bash..........
B001TH16DS|5.0|ANYTHING Star Trek covering TOS, TNG, DS9 & Voyager is an automatic purchase with me. I've owned this Stuff in EVERY format except HD-DVD! Getting it for a decent price is NICE, but not always the case. So BD is the next upgrade.

B0017WI5VQ|4.0|yes she is young, but adele adkins knows how to sing. interestingly, she also knows how to write a song so we know that she is not just another record industry puppet. the record, her first is a very solid album. she definitely knows where she is as an artist. 'chasing pavements'- great song. the thing is, there are a lot of great songs on this album. the cover version of the bob dylan track (track 9 on the album)is incredible. full of feeling and a testament to adele's ability to interpret another artist's work. i hope she has a long career....
B00012QM8G|4.0|I think this movie is well made and gives the viewer a good understanding as to what the death camps were like. Even though a movie can never fully make the viewers feel the pain fear and loss these people suffered it comes close. In all I feel the movie is well done.
B000M9BPEY|3.0|This is one of my family's favorite movies and I was thrilled to see that it was available on blu-ray. I eagerly popped it into my PS3 last night expecting a visual treat, but was sorely disappointed by the \\"less than blu-ray\\" quality of the image. I'm convinced that this is an upsampling of the DVD. There's a lack of clarity in the details throughout the film. If you played the blu-ray and DVD versions side by side, I doubt you would see any difference between them.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|The film starts out with the scope of what Richard Attenborough is trying to accomplish:<br />&quot;No man's life can't be encompassed in one telling. There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the court record and try to find one's way to the heart of the man...&quot;<br /><br />The story begins and ends in New Delhi India 30 January 1948. From here, we flash back to Gandhi's younger days as a lawyer when he first was introduced firsthand to South Africa and its injustices. From there we follow him through his trials and tribulations in South Africa and then India. What I enjoyed about the India part of the movie was that while he was learning about India, we get to travel with him and learn about India. Gandhi leaves a message not of nonviolence but appropriate responses and knowing that you're in control. Even though each viewer will have their ups and downs in the different parts of this movie, the two things that struck me the most was when India on the verge of independence had to split into two countries, and when Gandhi was dispatched by of all people, far right wing, conservative Hindus.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley excellently plays Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to the point that you can believe he is the real thing. However, the rest of the characters in the film have a problem with recognition to the point that you ask, &quot;Where have I seen that person before?&quot; then you can settle down again to the story. A major character that is sometimes overlooked is the soundtrack, which enhances but does not intrude on the film. A victim of more recent films is the salt mine owner Collins played by Richard Griffiths ... Uncle Vernon Dursley in the Harry Potter films.<br /><br />The Blu-ray treatment maintains or improves on the original Panavision and Technicolor.<br /><br />Remember that this film was designed for entertainment so sit back and let's be entertained.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001EWEB5I An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments With Truth]]<br />[[ASIN:1417636645 Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments With Truth]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000PUB2AC Joseph Campbell: Mythos I]]and let's be entertained.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001EWEB5I An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments With Truth]]<br />[[ASIN:1417636645 Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments With Truth]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000PUB2AC Joseph Campbell: Mythos I]]
B001PPLIEQ|4.0|This is a good story with good acting.  It is a better James Bond than we have become used to.  The best is the first however.  We were all younger and more naive then and James Bond came at the right time in our history.  Chas
B001NXBRJG|4.0|This was a great movie. Yeah, it has plot holes, but as you can see from the legions of fans, almost nobody noticed them. (In case you're one of those and your head just blew up: we blocked out the sun and the robots never thought of the vast energy resources of nuclear power? Instead, they used humans for power, even though it was obviously inconvenient to them, and even though the heat we give off as waste consumes more energy than it provides... obviously. We're energy CONSUMING creatures). The action is top notch and very innovative. The special effects was one of the most copied in decades. Too bad the W-brothers didn't have anything left. The sequels were pretty embarrassing, each worse than the last. I've seen several people comparing Star Wars unfavorably to the Matrix. Really, though, if you think about the Matrix, it ought to give you MORE respect for Lucas. It's not easy to sustain a storyline. The W-brothers couldn't do it past #1. Lucas has done six plus cartoons. He no longer adheres to the \\"immaculate reality\\" so stringently as he did in the beginning, but they're still good films (none of the six being worse than M3 Revolutions). It does bother me that so few people credit William Gibson with having been the father of the genre. If you'd ever read his cyberpunk works, you'd understand that Matrix isn't quite as innovative as you think (but then, he wasn't able to translate his edgy writing style into film, so oh well). As anyone who has seen Matrix knows, though, these are minor criticisms. Matrix was a great film. Watch it.
B001TOD92C|5.0|This was the best film of 2008, with the best acting performance by Rourke.    Simply wonderful.
0618918248|5.0|This is a great read for anyone on the fence about religion. I would have called myself agnostic before reading The God Delusion. I had never thought much about it, and figured agnosticism was a sensible, neutral position. But it turns out I wasn't even clear on the meaning of the word, nor was I clear on the meanings of \\"atheism,\\" \\"Christianity,\\" \\"Islam,\\" etc. In this book, Dawkins lays out the case for atheism and decimates the claims of most major religions.    Without giving a recap of the entire book, I'd like to say that it changed the way I think. I was never interested in discussing religion, even when I called myself a Christian. I found it uncomfortable, mostly because I was unable to think about it without being reminded of my many doubts about its claims. I decided to claim agnosticism in my teens, and it wasn't until I read this book last year that I admitted I had been an atheist pretty much the whole time.    Having freed myself of the discomfort I felt when thinking about religion -- and of thinking about things that run contrary to the claims of religion, like certain scientific claims -- I experienced a surge of interest in science, history, and politics (among other things). These things, I realized, had turned me off because of their religious implications. I became so interested in biology, for example, that I might have become a biologist had I been exposed to it an earlier age. I've got religious belief to thank for closing that door.    Back to the book, though: Dawkins is a gifted writer, and the book is an engaging read even if you don't agree with its premise. I've since read several of his books, and he excels at communicating difficult concepts in ways that are easily understandable. Even when he isn't spot-on in his reasoning (I've heard from a few philosophy buffs that his arguments in that area are fairly sophomoric -- e.g., his \\"Ultimate 747\\" argument, which seemed reasonable enough to me), he makes it clear how he arrived at his conclusions, and you can choose to agree or not at any step along the way. Unlike many Christian apologist authors, he actually gives you the dissenting viewpoint as well as his own, without modifying it to make it easier to tear down. (And, to be honest, he really doesn't need to. Religious claims are shaky enough on their own.)    If you're on the fence like I was, this is a great introduction to a lot of the things you'll probably be interested in after reading it. If, like me, this ends up being the final push over the cliff into atheism for you, it's one of the most worthwhile books you'll ever read. Having now read deeply into a lot of the subjects brought up in The God Delusion, I consider my initial proclamation of atheism one of the defining moments of my life. And I have Richard Dawkins to thank for that.
1400063515|4.0|Well, this is the new [[ASIN:0061234001 Freakonomics [Revised and Expanded]: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything]] By that, I mean this book takes a rarefied subject--in this case, epistemology--and presents it in a popular format. You wouldn't expect something so highbrow as epistemology to be so much fun, but so it is. Amazingly, this book on Black Swans it itself a Black Swan.<br /><br />Here's the nutshell: Black Swans are things that we don't know about (outliers) that have a tremendous impact. The terminology comes from the idea that for the longest time (back to Aristotle); we assumed that all swans were white--until we discovered black swans in Australia.<br /><br />Two examples are the book [[ASIN:0316015849 Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)]] and Ulysses S. Grant. I never would have guessed that yet another vampire book about a young woman whose initials are B. and S., written by a 30-something Mormon Mom in Arizona would take the world by storm. Meyers has a superb style, but everything else in the book has been done before. But so it is!<br /><br />And Ulysses S. Grant, a full-grown man who had to move back in with his parents and get a job with his brothers, and who was a mediocre West Pointer going up against Big Man On Campus, top-of-his-class Robert E. Lee would eventually win the Civil War. But so it is!<br /><br />(Susan Boyle of Youtube fame is another--it will be fun watching this ugly ducking rise as a black swan.)<br /><br />The book has a conversational tone, almost chatty. Therefore, the layman can understand the arcane subject. But the chattiness makes the book needlessly long. At times, I felt that NNT was talking in circles.<br /><br />Also, the subject matter was nothing new (like \\"Twilight\\"), but it is he format that makes it exciting (like \\"Twilight\\"). I had read Bastiat's [[ASIN:160096706X That Which Is Seen and That Which Is Not Seen: The Unintended Consequences of Government Spending]] with the Parable of the Broken Window (not to be confused with Wilson's Broken Window Theory of Crime). I had read Poppers [[ASIN:0415278449 The Logic of Scientific Discovery (Routledge Classics)]] and [[ASIN:0415278465 The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)]], so I knew the limits of knowledge. My critical skepticism came from Socrates (Republic, and the Four Dialogues). Logic was taught to me by Thomas Sowell's [[ASIN:046508995X The Vision of the Anointed: Self-Congratulation as a Basis for Social Policy]]and Fischer's [[ASIN:0710070365 Historians' Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical Thought]].<br /><br />This last one is important, since the Narrative Fallacy is a key component to Black Swans.<br /><br />I do have two criticisms, both metaphysical. First, our world is both Extremistan and Mediocristan. They are like Augustine's Christians, who simultaneously live in the City of God, and daily interact with the City of the Devil. They are the same place, but overlapping, with the City of God (like the Black Swan) embracing a more comprehensive paradigm.  Yet both models are valid. Yet he presents them as rivals, which I thing exacerbates the Black Swan problem.<br /><br />The other one is lightly touched upon in the book, but needs a fuller explanation: What is the metaphysical engine of Black Swans? Simple: irreversible, exponential proliferation, driven by the economy. Read and please re-read the slim volume [[ASIN:1576830705 Hurtling Toward Oblivion: A Logical Argument for the End of the Age]]. This book illustrates the potential catastrophes that can come from Black Swans.<br /><br />These second two criticisms are pinprick issues. On pages 192-193, NNT describes Poppers off-the-cuff response to someone who asked if falsifiability could be falsified. NNT needed a footnote pointing out that Poppers reaction was what logicians call an \\"ad baculum,\\" and a ham-handed one at that.<br /><br />Second, in a footnote NNT asserts that both computers and cars were the products of an \\"aimless process.\\" The individual sub-components may have been, but hasn't he ever seen schematics and blueprints before? Please read \\"I, Pencil\\" for a better treatment of how separate ideas come together to form a new whole, and then watch the Coppala/Lucas film \\"Tucker: The Man and his Dream.\\"<br /><br />On a personal note (and in conclusion), this book resonated with my heart in two ways. I understood perfectly the dismissiveness, arrogance, and infantile temper tantrums he describes in Part 3. I've seen the same things. The idealized world that Sagan describes in [[ASIN:0345409469 The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark]] is itself a demonic fiction.<br /><br />Second, throughout the book, NNT makes passing references to best-sellers not being Bell-Curves, but being Black Swans. All authors should understand this.  Dale Brown's manuscript for \\"The Old Dog\\" was rejected 100 times. Black Swans work to your advantage. I pray something like this will happen to my book, [[ASIN:1555177522 Consider My Servant Job]], and see the book The Black Swan as motivational, even devotional  literature.<br /><br />So NNT's book is really a Double Black Swan.ever seen schematics and blueprints before?

B001HN69AE|1.0|It seems Hollywood studios still don't get it. Spending 100 million dollars doesn't exactly mean great entertainment value or commercial success especially when making a film based on pop culture icons. They need a better script, better actions and most of all, someone like Guillermo del Toro, who can direct a film with confidence. \\"Dragonball Evolution\\" has none of them.    Some people in Hollywood just don't understand Son Goku is not Peter Parker, but anyway they wanted our hero act that way. Son Goku (Justin Chatwin) is a high school student whose bicycle is crushed by a bully's car. The fact is, Goku is a martial artist who can use the enormous power of \\"Ki,\\" but his grandfather (and master) Gohan (Randall Duk Kim) forbids him to use it. However, Goku cannot take it any more, so he confronts the school bullies without actually throwing a punch. The brief scene, which reminded me of the cafeteria scene in \\"Spider-man,\\" is arguably the best part of the film (with now familiar slow-motions shots). Sadly this is the only part I find interesting in the whole film.    The rest of the film is simply a mess with one incoherent story about seven Dragonballs that will grant one wish. Villainous Piccolo (James Marsters) attempts to get them all to destroy the world, as the lengthy narration says, but his motive is not clear and besides, being already a formidable enemy with a huge floating ship, Piccolo really doesn't need them, does he?    Goku's romance with Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) just drags. The subplot of Bulma (Emmy Rossum) and Yamcha (Joon Park) is weak and rushed. Special effects are at best passable. The tone of the film constantly shifts as if director James Wong is not really sure what he is doing. The film only continues to use clichés again and again, adding nothing new to the thin story.     Many \\"Gragonball\\" fans complain about the changes done to the original manga. The reaction is understandable, but considering the length of the original books and the number of the events they include, changes are inevitable. I know some characters (like Krillin) must go and some characters' traits should be toned down. (Master Roshi played by Chow Yun Fat looks less eccentric than in comic, for example.)    But the real point is, those characters in \\"Dragonball Evolution\\" have nothing that made the counterparts in the original comics or subsequent anime series so popular and endearing among the fans. If you haven't read the original books or seen the anime, you would not see why the \\"Dragonball\\" series is so popular all over the world after watching the live-action film. Filmmakers should know Yamcha is not just a bandit; Master Roshi is not just a strange old man; Bulma is not just a gorgeous girl. They all could be very cool, funny and attractive in their own way, with the irresistible charm that the filmed version sadly lacks.    Stephen Chow, who is known for his \\"Kung Fu Hustle,\\" is one of the producers of the film. Perhaps I am not the only one who thinks Chow's delightful over-the-top style of direction would have been perfect for the live-action \\"Dragonball.\\"
B000VI70WM|1.0|If you are into synth techno pop, or you are satisfied merely with the band's looks and image, you will probably like this. If you are into the original DD with rockin' guitar (which is what took them from ordinary popdom to one of the greatest bands ever), you will be disappointed beyond measure with RCM. They are currently working on a new album with Mark Ronson at the helm. I sure hope he brings them back to their former aural glory and not just as some marketing tool focusing on 20-something demographics. \\"Andy, come back!\\" is what they should be chanting; I certainly am!
0375826726|4.0|A delicious fantasy that is accessible to new readers to the series...now I must go back and read the first two!
B002413TY2|1.0|I really liked the first two, but this was awful.  Most of the movie is horribly written dialog between the two leads that has no relevance, and the plot holes are too gaping to ignore.  Consider that 1. Contracts signed under duress aren't valid and 2. There's no reason why the girl has to be transported in the first place.  The occasional slip-up is tolerable in an action movie, but two reasons why the entire thing is pointless is too much.  Even the above could be forgiven is there was some great action, but while (what little there was) was good, it was nothing like in the previous two movies.    Oh -- one highlight was the Ukrainian textile industry.  Apparently two of their cloth seat backs will stop bullets, and a dozen will protect you from an explosion powerful enough to send an ambulance ten feet in the air.  I've got a high tolerance for silly action, but I couldn't take this.

B000KIPT30|5.0|I did alot of research and if you need to hook multiple sets of headphones to only 1 headphone out, then this is your baby. I do a radio show with my friends and my mixer only has 1 headphone out. I plug this in and 4 of us have perfect sound with our own personal volume controls. The only thing i don't like about unit is it doesn't have an on/off switch, you must unplug the power source to turn it off, but that doesn't take away from its quality. 10 out of 10!

B000GSA59M|5.0|I got this mixer about 6 months ago. My friend and I do a weekly radio show on livevideo dot com every wednesday. We began by calling in on headsets with a mic, but I got this mixer and man is it great. I can have myself, and 3 other friends all on individual mics. I can control the volume and EQ for each mic, and mute them with one click. While thats all hooked up, I have a computer used soley as a music/sound effects machine. This mixer also has a total of 3 outs. So you can record on one out and still have 2 other usable outs. I did alot of research on mixers, and I'm 100% satisfied. I might suggest spending the extra money and buying the FX model. I didn't think I would need it, but I wish I would have the option to add effects to the sound. Even without that options is still a 10 out of 10!
031606792X|3.0|I read this series after seeing the movie. The book is much better than the movie, so I couldn't wait to get to the fourth installment. Overall, the series is pretty good especially for the young audience. Yet, I was overall disappointed with the final installment. First, the book is way too long and goes into way too many details that ultimately lead to nowhere. There is the feel of a buildup throughout the whole book with a completely predictable ending. Jacob such a great character is turned into nothing more than a glorified pedophile. I guess if you can't have Bella her newborn baby is the next best thing. There really is no reason for Bella to have gotten pregnant and after the honeymoon the book was extremely hard to read. I knew there was nothing good to come after hearing little nudger. Bella turned into an even more pathetic character until her transformation and even after that she was a little overwritten as a new vampire floating seemless into her new world with such grace and ease. The series would have been so much better if the book ended with their marriage. Then, there is  Bella's transformation which we all waited for but it turned into a scene from a bad horror movie more than the romantic and gentle moment that should have been shared only between Bella and Edward. This was a major letdown considering the innocence of the relationship they shared and the bond between these two characters. Overall, you can tell the author has no idea how to write a love scene which is utterly pathetic given the numerous fade to black..so I guess the overall book should not have been that much of a surprise. I would recommend the series but prepare yourself for a predictable outcome and a long drawn out book that leaves you feeling like you should have just stuck to the movies.
0897500482|5.0|I bought The Tao of Jeet Kune Do many years ago to supplement my Kung Fu training.  One of its most amazing qualities, is that something new can be discovered in it every time that you read it.  It is Jeet Kune Do, but I would argue that his principles are also Kung Fu/Wu Shu principles in origin, and clearly the result of his training roots.  I believe that Bruce saw a certain weakness in the way that modern Kung Fu was progressing, and he realized that the \\"formlessness\\" of Jeet Kune Do was something of a summit, the Everest of Kung Fu at its heart.  It is an immortal work, priceless in its spirit and its content.  I would recommend it to any martial artist seeking a higher path and deeper understanding.  Sincerely, Erik D.J. O'Brien, author of \\"Kur's Rage.\\"
B001PPLIFU|5.0|Very good Bond - not as good a story with too much emphasis on intense action - most of the time, when compared to Casino - in my opinion the BEST Bond ever.  But still good fun.
B001PPLIEQ|2.0|Don't get me wrong:  I love bond films in general, and Daniel Craig as bond in particular.  I thought Casino Royale was one of the best bond films ever, and I was looking forward to his second go at the franchise.  But Quantum of Solace is the worst bond film in recent memory.<br /><br />I saw it in the theater only once, but that was enough.  The action seemed frenetic and incoherent--lots of camera shake to add \\"excitement\\" in lieu of taught action directing.  I had hoped that watching the DVD at home on a smaller screen, where I could take in everything at once, and having already seen it once, that the film would make more sense and be more enjoyable.  No such luck.<br /><br />The entire opening sequence is a complete waste of celluloid.  Its a car chase between Bond and some unknown opponent.  We never learn who they are or why they're after him, but it doesn't matter because it has no bearing on the rest of the film.  But what does matter is that one is driving a black sports car, and the other a very dark charcoal gray sports car.  The two cars are nearly indistinguishable, and once they both get covered in dust in the second half of the sequence its even harder to tell them apart.<br /><br />The next action sequence is intercut with a horse race happening nearby.  Again it has no connection to the rest of the movie.  Bond chases his opponent through the crowd for a moment, but its not like one of them jumps on a horse or interacts with the race in any way.  And so it goes throughout the rest of the film.<br /><br />As a last resort, I figured that maybe the special features on the second disc might illuminate the murky plot, or at least be an engaging window into the production process.  When they set aside a whole disc just for special features, I expect them to actually be, well, special.<br /><br />The first clip in the disc is quite decent.  It talks about all the locations for the film, how they were chosen, how they were used.  It probably went on 20 or 30 minutes and it was interesting and engaging.  All the remaining clips were only a few minutes in length.  Most just rehashed bits of the same footage that was in the first clip, with out really adding anything.  The music segment was new, but it still lasted less than 5 minutes, and consisted mostly of shots from the shooting of a music video for the movie's theme song.<br /><br />Long story short, the movie was a disappointment, and the special features even more so.  If you absolutely need to own the DVD, save yourself a few bucks and skip the Two-Disc Special Edition.  There's really nothing special here.d engaging.

B001N26GFM|5.0|Bruno is the 8-year-old son of a high-ranking Nazi officer during WWII.  He is unhappy when his parents tell him that the family is moving to the country, as he hates to leave his friends.  The new house is a forbidding place with no other children around to play with.  Bruno is told not to wander in the back yard, but he manages to do so anyway and his explorations take him to a barbed-wire fence with a young boy on the other side.  This boy is wearing striped pajamas and his hair has been shaved off.  He is a stark contrast to Bruno, who has had a privileged upbringing and every material advanatage.  The two boys begin a poignant friendship which begins to show Bruno exactly what is going on over the other side of the fence.  This is a beautifully-made movie with wonderful, natural performances by the two young men who play the two main parts.  It is a movie to ponder and one which won't soon be forgotten.
044024367X|4.0|If you enjoy Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels, don't miss this one just because many reviewers got carried away with negativity.  I almost didn't buy it after checking the reviews; now I'm glad I didn't skip this one.  Not Child's best, but a good read.  My favorite author is Dean Koontz, and not all of his books are equally good either.  The book I am reviewing is ten times better than Koontz's weakest novel.  Lee Child does his homework, and you can always count on learning something from his novels.
B000TEPKAW|5.0|When U2 released their excellent `Achtung Baby' CD in the early 90s, critics and fans alike praised the \\"new\\" sound, admired them for their risk-taking, and generally fawned over the rock/electronica mix. Obviously Bono and the band were instrumental in this, but were it not for Brian Eno's influence and presence, it's unlikely if this album would have emerged as the great collection it did. Also, those who lauded this collaboration as groundbreaking need only to go back 20+ years to Eno's work with David Bowie with the Low/Heroes/Lodger trilogy to see that they were doing it back then.    This (`Heroes') album marks the pinnacle of their trilogy in my mind as I find it to be much more accessible than the dark (but brilliant) `Low' and not as (forgive me) odd as `Lodger'. The most recognizable track on the album, \\"Heroes\\" is still a wonderful song. \\"Joe The Lion\\", \\"Sons of the Silent Age\\", and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" are other highlights of the non-instrumental pieces.    However, side B is the true gem of this album. The combination of \\"Sense of Doubt\\", \\"Moss Garden\\", and \\"Neukoln\\" are some of the most beautiful and haunting instrumental work that Bowie and even Eno have produced. These three songs surrounded with the non-instrumental \\"V-2 Schneider\\" and \\"The Secret Life of Arabia\\" make for a spectacular 20 minutes of music.    If you're just starting to dabble in Bowie's work, this is definitely a good starting place.

1401384854|5.0|I've read at least a half dozen books on the subject of the Korean War.  This account best explains why so many things went wrong and why so many went right.  War is all too often necessary.  Yet, in the end the outcome and how many thousands will die always hinges on the one politician who is leading each of the nations involved and also on a very few military leaders.  This book opens all of that for inspection and I think it was done without the usual politcal slant these types of works include.

B000002KAT|5.0|I was all of 16 when Van Morrison's ASTRAL WEEKS came out over 40 years ago.  So I guess I could be forgiven for not quite \\"getting it.\\"   But this was one of the few times in my life when not liking a critical favorite was actually a bit disappointing.  I was one of those nerdy rock fan kids who pored over magazines like CRAWDADDY (which was  the more intellectual rock rag of the day) and HIT PARADER (which actually was quite good when it was edited by a guy named Jim Delahant) and, of course, the early tabloid, very lively ROLLING STONE.       So when I found myself not quite cottoning to the album's meandering, seemingly formless tunes, I pretty much blamed myself.  I mean, for a high school kid in the back woods of Maine, I liked some pretty weird stuff (WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT was actually my favorite album of '68, but that was an entirely different--and much ANGRIER animal).  So I filed away ASTRAL WEEKS for another astral day,  always figuring that I'd reconnect with it some day and would hopefully be able to fathom its dreamymysteries later.   The liner notes referred to a \\"stream of consciousness,\\" which put me in mind of Van Morrison's sort-of compatriot, James Aloysius Joyce, whose later works (after PORTRAIT) I had also decided to \\"get back to\\" one day when I would be older, wiser and less likely have a head full of surging rock'n'roll.     But at the time, well--when it came to tunes purportedly about drag queens--I preferred \\"Sister Ray\\" to \\"Madame George.\\"     I didn't necessarily think it would take me 40 years, necessarily (although Van is still ahead of Joyce on that score--since I still haven't quite gotten around to ULYSSES and FINNEGANS WAKE yet).   And you would have thought that after having been totally smitten with MOONDANCE for a time in the '70s, it certainly wouldn't have taken all that long to finally give ASTRAL WEEKS the re-hearing it deserved.     So here it is, 2009, and ASTRAL WEEKS has been my midnight music for the past several days.  And I'm finally listening to it on really good equipment.   And, yeah, I'm finally appreciating it for the moody, haunting work that it is.  The vocal mannerisms (especially the jazzy riffing and repetitions) that once seemed a little irritating suddenly seem inspired.  Yeah, you really do \\"breathe in you breathe out you breathe in you breathe out...\\"  More importantly, I find myself looking up the complete lyrics on the Internet (like so many singers of the Rock Era, Van's actual words can be hard to discern--leading to many a \\"'Scuse me while I kiss this guy\\" moments, but unlike so many others, you actually CARE that you're missing out).     So, yeah, I'm somewhat belatedly under ASTRAL WEEKS poetic spell.  Just in time to buy the commemorative live CD and DVD packages.  What timing!   Pretty cosmic, if you ask me.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I recently bought Season One after waiting for the price to drop. My husband was watching at 4am&6am on TV and I got tired of that. He said that this is the best gift he's ever received and since he worked as a TV/movie grip for many yrs and worked with William Shatner on TJ Hooker and Billy Blackburn and some of the other stars, this DVD series means alot to him now. He said the remastering was done pretty good for the most part and feels like TV history has been preserved well for what they had to work with.  After all, William Shatner & Star Trek changed the world!  Worth the price to see him so happy with it.  I bought him Seasons Two&Three for Christmas but he says Season One is the best and loves it.

I for one am very pleased with what Paramount is doing with the original films. They are the ones I have enjoyed many times in 30 years!  I can not wait.      So for all you people who act like this is a \\"double dip\\"...get over it! It's Star Trek on Blu-ray. Don't be a hypocrite and act like it's horrible and still buy it.

B00004VVND|5.0|\\"West World\\" is a great movie.  West World is one of three resorts, the others being Roman World and Medieval World.      These three resorts are run by a company named DELOS.  It costs guests $1,000 a day to stay at the resort area they choose.      The resorts ar areas each built like replicas of the time period the resort is named for.    The movie was made by MGM.  Old sets on the MGM lot that were used in other movies were used in \\"West World.\\"      The resorts are populated by human looking and human acting robots programed and dressed to behave like someone from the particular time period the resort is named for.  They even have robots who bleed when they are killed for example in a gun fight in West World.  The way you can tell who is a robot is to look at heir hands.  DELOS has not yet perfected the hands of the robots.      The guests who stay at these resorts can play and act out their fantasies of being and living in the time period the resort area is built to ressemble and be like.      Upon arrival, the guests are outfited by DELOS with clothes that are made to ressemble the time period of the resort they have chosen to go to.      The robots are built and programmed to perform a certain function in having and helping the guests to act out their fantasies.      They even have robots built and programmed to have sex.      The stars Richard Benjamin as a lawyer who has gone through a divorce and his friend played by James Brolin who has been to West World before has talked Richard Benjamin into going to West World with him believing that it wil help his friend to get over the divorce or at least forget about it for a while.    Ule Brynner plays this robot gunslinger who is supposed to antagonize guests and goad them into a gunfight which the robot is programmed to lose.  He is not supposed to hurt any of the guests.  None of the robots are supposed to hurt any of the guests.      A number of the robot models have been designed and built by computers so that even the technicians working and operating the the resorts at the main control center do not know everything about the robots and their construction.  They bring in the robots to repair them nd upgrade them with new parts, but they do not know everything about the robots.      Things begin going wrong as a virus that stated out in Roman World then spread to Medieval World and then West World.  They have been keeping things under control, but then realize that malfunctions are starting to happen to often.      They decide to call off the other upcoming stays by guests.  They decide not to interrupt the current one in progressf ffearing bad publicity.  However, the malfunctions continue to increase and the technicians lose control of the robots and computers.  The robots rebel and attack and kill the guests.      The gunslinger robot kills James Brolin and then goes after Richard Benjamin.  The gunslinger robot has jsut been upgraded with new telescopic and infrared sensors for his visual/eyes and enhanced audio to pickup the slightest sound.  A fleeing technician tells Richard Benjamin that the modle robot pursuing him is and will always be one step ahead of him.      I really liked this movie.      There wass even a sequel made to this movie called \\"Future World\\" that stared peter Fonda as a newspaper reporter sent there with a fellow reporter who is a liberated woman who is a go getter.  She keeps Peter Fonda at a distance.      Future World was open to replace West World because West World was the one selected by the media to spotlight when the robots went out of control in all three worlds in the prior movie.      Yule Brynner reprises his role as the gun slinger, but in a dream sequence.  The company technicians show the two reporters this new process they have for putting people to sleep and inducing dreams into their minds while they sleep.      They offer to give them a demonstration. The woman reporter volunteers. It turns out that the computer probes her mind and subconscious while she is asleep and finds that she has this actual inner longing to be dominated by a macho man.  She dreams that she is kidnapped by these two men.  Enter Yule Brynner as the gun slinger who kicks in the door pulling out both his six-shooters and gunning the two bad guys down.      He unties the woman reporter and then takes her up in his arms and takes her off to a newarby bedroom in the house and throws her on the bed as he joins her with the dreams sequence ending.      The two reporters then later find out that the company that runs the three worlds plan to have dignataries and political leaders come to there three worlds to visit and then replace them with robot copies of them which they will control and have do their bidding.      The sequel \\"Future World\\" unfortunately is not available on DVD as of this time.
0375842209|5.0|This story centering on a young girl named Liesel, takes place in Nazi Germany.  While memories of reading Anne Frank tainted my initial impression of this book, I gave it a read anyways.  This is not Anne Frank and the biggest difference is that Death is telling the story.  Death is intrigued by Liesel when he first sees her and he follows her story each time their paths cross.<br /><br />I am not one for tales that make me cry, but if it can do that then the author has done something right.  I grew attached to Liesel by each step she took, her love of words, her love of her family, both real and foster, and her unending quest to do the right thing. While the book is fictional, Zusak makes it seem as if it is a true tale.  The book is filled with thorough descriptions of all the main characters along with inanimate objects such as the accordion that is featured throughout the story.  He has the ability to make me smile at the joys of young love and self discovery as well.  After having read the book, I am now intrigued by Death and I must agree with how it sees things.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|The Reader is set in post World War II Germany in the late 50's where the post-war generation is simultaneously trying to forget and to come to terms with, literally the sins of their fathers (and their mothers`) Nazi past.<br /><br />A 16 year old Michael Burke (David Kross) meets Hannah (Kate Winslet) an older woman and they have an affair. The affair at first seems to be about sex. When Michael brings his schoolbooks to Hannah's house, which includes a copy of The Odyssey, Hannah asks Michael to read it to her. Throughout the summer of their affair Michael reads book after book to her until one day Hannah disappears without any explanation to Michael.<br /><br />Michael assimilates the loss of Hannah into his life and moves on becoming a law student. One day one of his professors takes Michael and the class to a war crimes trial where Michael discovers Hannah is one of the defendants. During the war Hannah had a been a prison guard and true to Hannah's character she had become a guard because it was a good job, and still truer to Hannah's character is the revelation that Hannah asked the prisoners to read to her. Michael is devastated to learn why Hannah picked a prisoner to read to her and what happened to them afterwards. But Hannah has a deeper secret, one she fears revealing more than a war crime. Michael has information that would exonerate Hannah, and if Michael helps her or doesn't sets the moral conflict of the story. Both sides of the issue are discernable, arguable and provocative.<br /><br />Michael grows up to be Ralph Fiennes, and Kross looks enough like Fiennes that there's no jolt as the movie switches from a young Michael to the older Michael. You believe Kross can grow up to be Fiennes. Fiennes as the older Michael and half a lifetime away from Hannah still can't come to grips with the effect, both positive and negative that Hannah has had on his life, as he tries to assuage his guilt in an attempt to come to terms with it.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly great throughout the movie and David Kross holds his own with both Winslet and Fiennes. While Fiennes is consistently good in the movie, this is Winslet's movie. One scene that stands out is a moment between Fiennes and Winslet when Hannah wants and needs to be held by Michael and her body betrays her emotions. It is a moment rarely seen in actors that they can portray their characters so viscerally and vulnerably. It's a nuanced gesture that says so much for the character and for Winslet's increasing acting abilities.<br /><br />I like bonus features on DVD's and The Reader has plenty of bonuses for you. There are deleted scenes that seem like they could have only been deleted for time considerations because they add to, or would have added to the understanding of Hannah. Usually, when watching deleted scenes you understand why they were deleted, but not in this case.<br /><br />There are also featurettes about the making of the movie, Kate Winslet explaining the make-up (which is actually interesting and funny) and a featurette about the composer as well as the set design of the movie.<br /><br />From the movie to the bonus features this a complete and full package for someone looking for a good movie to add to their DVD collection.e movie and David Kross holds his own with both Winslet and Fiennes.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Neil Patrick Harris' best work ever!! Dude from Fire Fly does a Great proformance... who knew he could sing. Felicia Day is very loveable. My sister had this posted on her myspace page, and I watched it. I then went to Hulu and watched it a few more times. Invited my friends over and watched it again. You could go on Hulu and watch it for Free, but if you want to support the actors and producers so that maybe they can make more great stuff like this, I recommend that you buy this Musical. Also recommend buying the CD. Mine is on the way: this is something you might want to listen to in the car while stuck in traffic. It might just make your day better.
B000FGG60W|4.0|I saw this movie when first released on Video and found it too dark at first than again when released on DVD with a better pic and sound and now have it on HD with a clearer picture and sound so if you like Sci Fi movies recommended four out of five .
B000R7GKQE|5.0|this season is epic.  best characters, best storylines, and best acting.  this show is well worth every penny.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|This is a good movie.  The movie played well in all DVD players I used it in until I lost the movie somewhere.
B001993Y2C|5.0|My title says it all.  From start to finish, the scope of the story line, the casting, the direction, the special effects (although the CGI could have been SLIGHTLY better on some of the cylons - it's some of the best we'll ever see), the intensity, the drama, the dynamics between characters, and everything else, this is simply the best series that has been on television.      You don't buy Sci-Fi?  No problem.  I know MANY people, including my wife (who is also a professional actress and particularly critical of actors and film in general), was mesmerized by the whole series from the pilot miniseries on.  She watched with me, thinking she was humoring my inner geek, and was blown away.  She was not a fan of the original series, and neither am I.  The earlier series was trivial; especially by comparison.  Every episode left my stomach in knots!    If you don't watch this show somehow, somewhere, you're missing out.  I heard many television critics (who do not favor scifi) who also referred to some of the single episodes as \\"the best episode of any television series I've ever seen.\\"    Seriously... 5 stars isn't nearly enough.  I can NOT exaggerate this enough, because no matter how impressive I tell you it is, you won't only be disappointed but you'll be AMAZED at how great it is when you do see the show.
B00009QG73|5.0|Two words describe this concert and DVD: \\"the best.\\"    Here is the final night of the Roxy band's reunion concert in October of 2001 in London. It features nothing but great songs, great musicians and great visuals. This is still the best concert DVD I have ever watched, and I've seen maybe a hundred.       I have such a high opinion of this DVD because it combines great music with tremendous visuals. If there is a better job of filming an indoor concert, I'd like to see it. The editing, sharp picture, dazzling colors and fun performers/musicians and dancers are a real treat.    The concert features the Roxy Music band's regular performers for many years, meaning Ferry, guitarist Phil Manzanera saxophonist Andy MacKay, pianist Colin Good and drummer Paul Thompson. Added to the mix are guitarist Chris Spedding, and two great-looking and extremely talented female musicians, Julia Thornton (percusssion and keyboards) and Lucy Wilkins (violin and keyboards). Also, a third female addition, Sarah Brown, is great on vocals and I'm sorry she didn't do her solo on \\"Jealous Guy,\\" as she did on the CD.  Finally, Zev Katz provides solid bass play but is a low-key guy who stays in the background.    In addition to his singing, Ferry shows talent on keyboards, harmonica and even whistling! Each musician is outstanding and given opportunities to show his or her talent. Manzanera has the most guitar work.    The steady beat, thanks in large part to Thompson's strength on drums, and mellow-ish music all make for a unique sound unlike any other I've ever heard. I don't think these guys were as good when they were young but they've honed talents and now excel in the instruments they play. They (the regulars) are all probably in their mid 50s. Combine that with the great camera-work and you have a concert on DVD that is hard to beat. If only they all were filmed this well!
B001PPLIEQ|4.0|If you didn't pay careful attention to this film you would've missed the subtle nuances of great film making with certainly an Alfred Hitchcock feel. I wish the master director was alive today to make a Bond film~!This is a Bond that is not only relentless but is also brutal which I totally enjoyed. Yes, there is the comparison to the \\"Bourne\\" films, but Bond and Bourne are still too different animals. Who said that Bond had to be geared to a certain way? The beauty of Quantum of Solace is that Bond gets to let loose and the bad guys get what they deserve. Bond is a British Bulldog and Bourne an American Eagle so to speak. Given that idea Quantum is slightly flawed. An issue about the film is that it could've slowed down just a little bit and had some more meaty dialogue sequences. I also didn't like the Tom Ford choice of clothes for the film. Tom Ford is talented but there was something missing. Brioni clothes were excellent for the Bond series. Before Quantum of Solace hit the screen I heard that there was talk of Dunhill doing the clothes for 007 which would've been excellent. Then again, Norton & Sons, or any of the Saville Row tailors could've done the job nicely. Other than that this film was highly entertaining and a smart idea to make it a sequel to Casino Royale. There's also talk linking this film to the next / third installment of the 007 franchise. Mr. White from the Quantum Organization is still alive at the end of Quantum. That might be a place to start. As far as the Special Edition of this disc is concerned it has DTS which cranks on my home theater system BUT I can only hope that when I update to Blu-Ray very shortly that the Sony / Columbia people remember to update the sound on this and all the 007 DVD's to 7.1 DTS-ES-HD sound. Granted 7.1 is still in the early stages but given the economic state of things people are conserving money and staying home more often. Hey Sony corporation and Bond producers, give us all the great sounds like DTS on theDVD's the we the public buy~!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|This is my favorite season of Supernatural and this bluray version is BEAUTIFUL!!!  BEST SHOW ON TV!!! Friggin amazing.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Wonderful product, excellent service, I had the movie for my granddaughter in a matter of a few days. I would purchase from this seller again!  Thanks a million.
B001QWQJ74|5.0|Sorry but this is an awesome movie.  Lot's of Vin Diesel eye candy with some vicious bird monsters thrown in. Vin can do no wrong. The bad guy who saves the day (well, for some of the characters).
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|Until the trial begins, you might wonder why you're sitting there watching a rather b****y woman having an affair with a stalkerish teenage boy in late 50s Germany. The tracking shots drag on a bit longer than necessary, and both characters seem obsessed with water for reasons I haven't quite discerned.    The film gets going once Hanna is put on trial for her actions as a guard in the SS during WWII.  Her young lover is forced to watch and listen as she reveals her complicity in events that left hundreds dead.  This is where Winslet gets a chance to show the complexity and emotions of a woman who has done things she can't keep hidden.    Another secret, which I won't reveal, has to do with why she wants the young man to come around--and it isn't so much for sex.  It's also the reason why the older version of this fellow, played ably by Ralph Fiennes, sends her so many tapes while she's in prison.  It's not clear to me why she did not take advantage of her upcoming parole (I won't spill on that point either).  However, overall this is an interesting and unpredictable meditation on guilt, love, and diligence.  And the makeup dept. did a good job of aging Kate, even down to her feet.
6304806434|3.0|Synopsis:  Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) is sent to jail for manslaughter and misses the birth and development of his daughter.  He's set to get out and see his daughter for her birthday on July 14th.  However, the only way he can get back is through taking a prisoner ship with all of the baddest criminals in the system, including Nathan \\"Diamond Dog\\" Jones (Ving Rhames), Cyrus \\"The Virus\\" Grissom (John Malkovich), Joe \\"Pinball\\" Parker (Dave Chappelle), and feared serial killer Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi).  All goes well until the bad guys hijack the flight and take control.  It's up to Cameron Poe to go against the odds and take matter into his own hands so he can see his daughter on her birthday.  John Cusack and Colm Meaney appear as U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin DEA Agent Duncan Malloy, respectively.     Alright so lets take a look at what this movie has:  -  An incredibly awesome cast, check.  -  Some of the greatest special effects committed to tape, check.  -  An excellent score which was worthy of an Oscar nomination, check.  -  A story line that's even remotely realistic or unpredictable... darn, knew it dropped off somewhere.     Truthfully, that's what killed the possibility of me wanting to give it a higher score than what I did.  I know that most action films are supposed to defy the laws of logic, but once Nicolas Cage's character was like \\"I'm gonna show you God does exist\\" and walks through a wall of gunfire with professional criminals shooting at him, you really can't help but think \\"Seriously?  Seriously?!  SERIOUSLY?!?!\\"    Be that as it may, there was still a lot about the movie to love and it was mostly the cast they had surrounded themselves with.  I mean, Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle, John Cusack, Steve Buscemi... these are some of the greatest performers for their respective genres and it's remarkable that such an ensemble cast was put together for an action film.  Throw in some excellent support from Monica Potter,Danny Trejo, Colm Meaney, Mykelti Williamson, and Rachel Ticotin and you've got an effort that the performers should be proud of.  Oh, and the special effects and music makes the ride worth it, too.    I consider this movie more of a guilty pleasure than a top film, but I've seen it in theaters and at home so I will consider myself a fan.  I recommend it for someone who wants to check out a fun action movie.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is the absolute best show I have ever watched.  I'm completely 110% addicted to a tv show and that never happens!
B001FB55MG|5.0|Very cute film! A great way to spend time with your children. With Adam Sandler, you know you will be laughing. Especially, with that silly looking gerbil you see throughout the entire movie, and you won't miss how he's first introduced!<br /><br />P.S You're kids may crave gumballs while watching this film..have some on hand!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I'm holding my breath until I can get my hands on this box set(and the season isn't even over yet). I have Seasons 1-3, which I have lent to friends and family and thus gotten them hooked on this awesome show. It's the best show on tv right now, no question in my mind. Each season is progressively better than the one before and Season 4 started with a bang and has only gotten better. I'm truly amazed that the cast and crew have maintained the level of excellence we've come to expect from Supernatural. They give 110% to each episode and it really shows. I can't recommend this series highly enough- if you haven't seen it, you're missing out on a gem. It has everything you could possibly want- drama, comedy, action, thrills, etc. Definitely check it out.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|We saw this movie at the theater, and were equally impressed with the Blu-Ray.  We enjoyed the shift from suave and swarmy, to deadly and committed.  The extra detail provided by Blu-Ray is awesome and well worth the few extra dollars.
B0017PCX20|4.0|A friend of mine introduced me to The Pineapple Thief and, always being interested in checking out new music, I went over to their page on Last.fm and checked out a few samples.  Intrigued by what I heard, I decided to pick up the latest release \\"Tightly Unwound.\\"<br /><br />On my first listen, I couldn't fully absorb the songs because all I could think was \\"This really sounds a lot like Radiohead.\\"  Not that that is a bad thing, of course, but I suppose I was looking for a little more variety.  The album opens with some very strong and memorable tracks in \\"My Debt To You\\" and \\"Shoot First.\\"  The remaining songs on the album are all solid in their own way, building upon the midtempo grooves established in the first two tracks.  While I enjoy listening to the album, I don't hear a whole lot of raw creativity, but I do hear excellent songwriting, pristine production, and exceptional performances.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Radiohead (as I am), then you will definitely enjoy this disc.  If you are looking for something that builds upon Radiohead and charts some new territory, you might be a little disappointed.  With that said, I still recommend this disc because, as another reviewer pointed out, the album does grow on you the more you listen to it.
B001C08RHA|4.0|This last year has been a major disappointment for science fiction but there seems to be a veritable glut on superheroes going on now, so I waited to buy Iron Man after I bought The Dark Knight and Hancock, and I can't wait to see Watchmen when that comes to DVD.<br /><br />Iron Man turned out to be much better than I expected given Marvel's past failures like Daredevil, The Punisher (that's the 2nd one; I really liked the first one with John Travolta and Thomas Jane), and as far as I'm concerned, The Hulk. For an origin story, it is well written save for a plot hole or two and very well acted & directed. From beginning to the end credits (and you really have got to wait til the end of the credits or you miss the zinger) this is a really good movie. Not great, but really good. As for the DVD, that's another matter. I was hoping this movie would come in fullscreen like The Dark Knight, The fantastic Four, and other movies where you either bought it fullscreen or as in some cases, you got a disc with widescreen on one side and fullscreen on the other.<br /><br />Too much of the good stuff gets cut out with widescreen, And I don't know why these companies assume that everyone can afford-- or will even buy a wide screen TV if they could afford it-- and so make movies in only one limited format. Iron Man is already in Blu Ray, so why not fullscreen as well? Then you would have a five star DVD to watch!
B001TOD92C|1.0|If you live in a trailer, if you have two first names, if all your siblings have different fathers, then this movie is for you.  Mickey Rourkes puffy, plastic filled face is a tragedy.  So is his greasy, blond hair extensions. His acting is overrated.  So is this movie.  Sorry about the Oscar Mick, maybe next time.
B000VH34LO|4.0|I saw stevie on Phil Donahue promoting the album. He said it was a \\"digital\\" recording done by sony in japan, the audience just stared at him having NO idea what he was talking about.this was 1979
B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Under the veneer of a tale of interwoven relationships, this is an attempt to glorify dysfunctional and self-destructive behavior at the expense of what one of the actors calls \\"puritanical values\\". Characters that live a traditional lifestyle are portrayed as empty and vapid, while those engaging in spurious casual relationships are presented as exciting and self-fulfilled. Despite this, things do not go well for the 'wild ones'. My suspicion is that in real life, things would have gone even more badly.     Penelope Cruz does a wonderful acting job as the psychotic ex-wife; Javier Bardem does nearly as well as the contemporary Casanova. I don't get the point of Scarlet Johansson, but maybe that's just me. Bottom line - it kept my attention for the duration, despite 'chick-flicks' not being my usual genre. But the movie itself, like several of its key characters, seemed kind of dysfunctional.
6303269826|5.0|From director Lawrence Kasdan (writer of \\"STAR WARS Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\\" & \\"Raiders Of The Los Ark\\") comes an in-depth look at Wyatt Earp, the main participant in the famous \\"Gunfight At The O.K. Corral\\" (the title of an earlier movie starring Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, directed by the legendary John Ford). Kevin Costner, recently an Oscar winner for \\"Dances With Wolves,\\" stars as the lawman, Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday and two time Academy Award winner Gene Hackman as Wyatt's father. Hackman's top billing is somewhat misleading, as he's onscreen for less than 20 minutes. However, this film is a mostly accurate portrayal of Wyatt Earp (inaccuracies listed at the Wikipedia and Internet Movie Database pages for this movie). Jim Caviezel, in a minor role as Warren Earp, is good as is the rest of the supporting cast, which includes Michael Madsen, David Andrews, Bill Pullman, Mark Harmon, Catherine O'Hara, Tea Leoni, Mare Winningham as a b--chy, suicidal prostitute and the actress who plays Josie. The only minor negative was Isabella Rossellini, who is nowhere as pretty or as good an actress as her famous mother Ingrid Bergman (who will be best remembered for<br />\\"Casablanca\\"). Unfortunately, \\"Tombstone\\" fared much better at the box office, and I can see why: more star power. This film is rated PG-13, but should've been rated PG.
015206396X|5.0|The characters in this book are surprisingly detailed.  The story is engaging.  She has created a firm reality in both the characters and the world and she sticks with it.  Really, the only bad thing is, this is her first book.  Now we just have to wait for more...
0439813786|5.0|I ordered this book for my nephew's 9th birthday at the recomendation from a customer of mine that works in a library. I always like to read the gifts I give and cannot express enough how much I enjoyed this book. I can't wait for him to read it to see what he thought about it. Such a great book. I can see why it has won awards. I almost want to buy another to have in my own colection.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This movie was my formal introduction to this story, & the compelling character of Erik, aka the Phantom, O. G. & the Angel of Music. I found the music & the overall story itself to be hauntingly beautiful, & purchased the 2 disc widescreen edition. Thought the choice of people who played the various roles to be superb, understanding that the cast from the original musical was excellent as well. As far as the story itself goes, it was well presented, the music was incredible - & the end scenes one unexpected occurrence after the other. I also found Erik's experiences as a child to be horrific, finding myself praying that there was hope for his tormented, lonely soul after the end of the scene in his lair. I do enjoy musicals when they are well done, & this was the best of the best, being a truly magnificent production.
B000YGIIQI|5.0|This is an amazing autobiography. If you are a Ramsay fan you get just what you'd expect--some brutal honesty, some settling of old scores, some name dropping, and of course some profanity liberally sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />The first half of the book where Ramsay talks about his childhood, his soccer ambitions, and his apprenticeship into the world of haute cuisine is fascinating.  Once he has \\"made it\\" in that world however the stories aren't as interesting to me.  However, the book is very short and thankfully this ends before getting too tiresome.  Still in all it is a pretty good read and taking price into consideration it definitely is 5 stars given the $2.87 I paid for the Kindle version.
B000LB7G00|4.0|I bought this mainly for use with SolidWorks, and for that it works fine. My only complaint is, the buttons are worthless. In order to actuate them you have to be very patient. It is really cool when used with Google Earth, it's like flying.
0321544080|4.0|Adam Ansel was saying that photographers do not take pictures, they make them.   This book is exactly about this - how to make great photos. And have some fun in the process.  The only problem is that, although the writing is easy, almost as in a blog, the techniques employed sound at times too complex: \\"...a full green conversion on the strobe, and 30 points magenta on the lens.\\" But don't let this stop you from buying the book and making great photos.
006016848X|5.0|I have not read through the entire book yet but so far I am very pleased with the contents, it has definitely opened my eyes and given me many things to think about that I took for granted before or just plain never even considered. If you are having doubts or concerns about how to handle your relationship woes then this book is right for you.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie is a delight, with a fantastic and well chosen cast of well known and new actors. I have given it as a gift to my family and friends. It has many stories going on at once, yet the director manages to blend them together, so that as time pases it becomes obvious that all the characters are actually quite connected.<br /><br />Liam Neeson and Hugh Grant do superb jobs in their roles. Martine McCutcheon as Natalie is a delight, which adds to her popularity in England and the USA as a singer and winner of the Laurence Olivier Award. Others in the movie have long been well respected, notably Emma Thompson, Colin Firth and Laura Linney.<br /><br />The soundtrack is wonderfully done for each scene and each character. The movie has abit of drama, some unrequited love, and some very clever sight gags and other things which engage and entertain throughout. The movie is abit long, but time passes quickly, as it does not have any slow moments while it goes from one story sub-plot to another. Billy Bob Thorton does a very good job as an arrogant and chauvinistic US president. Thomas Sangster, as Neeson's son who recently lost his mother, does an admirable job in a part that demands both serious as well as comedic acting skills.<br /><br />This is truly a great movie for anyone over age sixteen or so, and especially for the adults who have been through many of the situations and problems examined in the movie in their lifetime. Throughout, it is a \\"feel good movie\\" that shows insight into love, fidelity, trust and the things in life that truly and \\"actually\\" matter. If you like this movie, you will enjoy watching it when you need cheering up, a good laugh, or watching something that points out that love, as complicated and difficult as it can be in its many forms, does indeed make the world go around.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|The biggest problem with this movie was that it tried to combine Alien culture with Indiana Jones, did not show us how Mutt Williams really changed by the end of the film (the kid did not seem in the least more interested about school/history), the woman in the story was written deliberately to be a dimwit, the scene in the quicksand and domestic fight between Indy and Marion in the truck was crazy, and the Atom Bomb survival scene was written by a three-year old. Plus we are now supposed to believe that ants can eat people.  It's not even a good Saturday Morning Cartoon. The original Indiana Jones movies were B-movies dressed up as A movies, and this is a B-movie dressed up as  a D movie. Pitiful end to a high-caliber adventure series. Why didn't Spielberg get Kasdan to write the script--HE was the brains behind Raiders and Empire Strikes Back. Kasdan knows how to write a script.
0439023483|4.0|I picked this book up after reading recommendations from both<br />Stephenie Meyer and Steven King.  The plot is like a cross between The<br />Running Man and Lord of The Flies with an element of romance, and I<br />loved it!<br /><br />The book is written in present tense which gives every scene a sense<br />of immediacy. And I loved the  voice of Katniss, especially in the<br />beginning when we learn the risks she has had to undertake in order to<br />survive and feed her family.<br /><br />The whole idea of the hunger games fills you with such a sense of<br />impotent rage and sympathy for the district people.  Truly a powerful<br />book.  I can't wait to read the rest of the projected trilogy.
B001HN69AE|5.0|First let me say, this movie is extremely flawed. But I think that's due entirely due to the low budget of the film. Also, if you're a fan of the Dragonball series, you will know that this movie does not have a whole lot in common with it. However, if you accept the movie as a different take on the Dragonball series and accept it for what it is, the movie is highly entertaining. I really enjoyed all the characters. Most notably Justin Chatwin as Goku. Sure, he was a white guy. But I think he really fit the part. I also loved his relationship with Chi Chi and Master Roshi. The weakest character, sadly, was Piccolo who REALLY needed more screen time. He's sort of an after thought. The movie also could have benefited from more fight scenes. The movie in general was way too short but I think that's due to the budget.<br /><br />After seeing the Legend of Chun Li, I was expecting this movie to be just as bad. But I was pleasantly surprised. I think Dragonball fanboys will despise the film but I don't really care. The movie gets 5 stars from me for being the best it could be given the budget it had.<br /><br />It's REALLY shameful how Fox treated this movie. It got nearly NO advertising. The movie came out last week and I had no idea it was out. I saw ZERO ads for it. Fox should NOT be allowed to handle films like this if they're not going to take it seriously. Shame on you Fox.
0439023483|5.0|I have read this book twice and listened to the audio book, and I still love it as much as ever!  I have recommended it to all my friends, who love it as well.  We can't wait for the next book!
B0000009SY|4.0|I have been a fan of Frank Zappa ever since my dad turned me on to his irreverent stuff when I was a kid.  As I got older and studied music, I was able to appreciate the complexity of his arrangements and the virtuosity of the musicians in his group.      I was late to really get around to listen to this album, but when I finally did, I found it to be one of the most truly enjoyable Zappa albums to listen to; but why?  I think the first thing that struck me while listening to the album the first few times was that the Frank and the band seemed to really be having fun while producing it (FZ's pauses to laugh off-mic occasionally while being the Central Scrutinizer are very touching, human moments--not really something he shared with the public very often).  Second, the production value of this album is some of the best I've heard in his catalog; all instruments and voices are clearly distinguishable in the mix, and the overall sound the band puts out is pleasing.  Third, there are just a lot of really good songs on here.      My biggest disappointment in this album came when I found out that much of the material was songs previously written by FZ.  Once I realized that, it was clear that the sad, bizarre story of Joe was nothing more than a way to string together unrelated songs.  \\"Catholic Girls\\" and \\"Crew Slut\\" were pretty weak to begin with--realizing that the plot was written around those songs only makes them weaker.  Once I realized that \\"Dong Work for Yuda\\" was about FZ's bodyguard, I had a hard time thinking of it as anything else (I know, the Scrutinizer says he's a \\"record executive,\\" but all the vocal quips in there are clearly things relating to a band on tour)    Still, most of the songs do hold up.  The title track is infinitely pleasing, and even somewhat bittersweet.  \\"Wet T-Shirt Nite\\" is an excellent composition, as is \\"Keep is Greasy\\" and \\"Packard Goose.\\"  Songs like \\"Token of My Extreme\\" and \\"Dong Work for Yuda\\" have a lot of that \\"fun-factor\\" I mentioned earlier; plus, the drumming on them is brilliant.  I know some people don't like \\"Stick it out,\\" but come on, what's not to like about a big vocal harmony of \\"F@ck me, you ugly son of a b@tch\\"?  Same thing with \\"Sy Borg.\\"  Yes, it's gross, but the song sounds like they recorded it with a smile.  And that comes across to the listener, as I press \\"play\\" again, and can't quite explain why....
1416914307|4.0|Reading some of the 3 stars and under reviews about City of Glass I was torn. There were some good points people made, like Jace and Clarys relationship and Clary in general but I don't think that it was boring, or predictable. I suck at figuring plot twists anyway so even if it had been predictable then I probably wouldn't have guessed it.<br />I thought she did a great job. Everything was explained, and it all made complete and total sense, which is really the most important thing.<br />There were some things that I felt were lacking. I would have liked to see more of the battle and less of angsty declarations of love. But it was a great read and as finale to the series it was an ending that I enjoyed.

031606792X|5.0|I started the Twilight series a week ago and just finished Breaking Dawn yesterday.  It turned out to be my absolute favorite of the series and I came to Amazon expecting others to feel the same way - what a shock to find so many negative reviews!    I'm going to have to agree with the reviewers who feel this book appeals to the older crowd rather than the younger, since I'm a 41-yr-old female.  Reading the whole series in a week really pointed out how the books have matured, especially this one.  Bella came into her own and found the place she belonged.  Jacob is getting a second chance at being part of her family. And Edward finally has a partner who's an equal.  I was absolutely thrilled to see Edward and Bella's romance move beyond the \\"can they or can't they\\" phase and become a real relationship with all it highs and lows.    Having the second section of the book told from Jacob's viewpoint was brilliant - if it had been told from Bella's or Edward's side the story would have dead-ended and become claustrophobic.  Having an outside perspective of what was happening and being able to see how torn up Edward was and how resolved Bella was made it perfect.      This was a wonderful installment of the series and a great way to end it (although I definitely see some possibilities for future books if Meyer finds the story needs to continue).  I really loved the fact that Bella turned out to be perfect as a vampire and discovered the beauty and grace that Edward always saw in her.  The fact that they have a daughter (and what a daughter!) makes things even better, along with Jacob now being a part of their family.  A very satisfactory conclusion!

B000KDBOKC|5.0|Do you have Let It Bleed on vinyl? Get this anyways. Do you have it on cassette, 8 track, or reel-to reel? Get this anyways. Do you have the 1986 CD? Get this anyways. Do you have the DSD SACD hybrid remaster? Get this anyways. No matter what version of Let It Bleed you have (and if you are are fan, you have to have at least one copy on one format) get this version anyways. It's a nice upgrade from the standard issue CD, the real value here being the luxurious packaging (huge page of liner notes, bonus poster) and the bonus outtakes and alternate mixes. Granted, the mastering leaves a little something to be desired when compared to the DSD remaster (more tape hiss and bass distortion here) but the mastering flaws are really very minor. I think these CD Maximum releases are a great value, but only if you spend 20 or less on them.
B000025SJ8|5.0|This is easily in my top 5 albums.  It is a great Black Metal CD filled with the greatness of BURZUM!  From beginning to end you will be blown away by the epicness of the album.  Just a fantastic album, buy it!<br /><br />-Konkrypt
B001MYIXAW|4.0|On Blue Ray this film looked great.  The film quality was great, the sound quality was great and the way it was filmed was really brought out on a HD spectrum.  The film has subtitles as well as dub voice over in English.      In terms of movie story;  the film was the 400 Blows meets the Ring meets Dracula.  It was a cool idea and I'm sure the book is even more crazy.  It was fun to watch and I would recommend it because it didn't use the typical shock thrills where movies try to scare you more with loud sounds and what not.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|One of King's best!  Prison pictures are not generally to my liking, however, this is much more than that! Cleaver to the end.  Well written for screen, as well as cast and acted!  An all time favorite.  Has much of the character-study as well as \\"twist\\" to the plot to please those of us that a fans of O'Henry. Thank goodness they put this presentation in a hard case container.... years of watching will require it!

B001E0FRD0|5.0|An extraordinary story detailing the rigors of becoming a Navy Seal and the author's (and his team's) experience in an Afghanistan deployment in 2005. The personal detail on several Seal team members in addition to the author dramatically elucidate the sacrifices these men and their peers make to preserve our freedoms. They do it all voluntarily, virtually invisibly, and without much deserved thanks. It also provides rare insight into the lives and beliefs of the Afghanistani people inhabiting the war torn mountainous north eastern regions. And into the effect the press can have in its reporting about the conflict.    The style of writing isn't smooth but the detailed recollections of Mr. Luttrell are remarkable.   The book cannot be recommended too highly.
6305736650|4.0|Amazon needs to indicate that this comes in a cheap click case and not a hard case as this matters to some of us choosing to buy this edition of the movie.  Should be listed in the \\"details\\" of the product.  Movie is 5 stars, couldn't possibly be anything less, however, rated this edition a 4 due to the cheap case. This movie will be watched over and over for many years, but I doubt the case is up to the challenge. 50 cents more to the purchase price would be worth it!
B000003C4K|5.0|Of all the Thrash debuts to emerge in the early 80s, few made the impact that Exodus struck with this album.  Metallica's debut was more or less just a version of Americanized Motorhead, with a liberal doseage of Savage's \\"Loose N Lethal\\". Slayer's debut was a more technical version of Venom. Exciter's debut was agressive, but one note.Metal Church had Thrash in there music, but were more of a traditional based act. Anthrax were still working on there sound and Megadeth were more of a Speed Metal band than a Thrasher....in the beginning.  Exodus was by far the most brutal of the bunch. There level of proficency was far ahead any of there     contemporaries and there singer was the most venomous and evil to arrive on the scene at that point. Paul Bailoff's vocals are in a way, terrible, but fit the music as what they are supposed to be. A form of channelled, controlled agression and anger. The introductory title track is a masterwork for the vocalist and one of the genre's great anthems, celebrating for one of the first times, the brutality and insanity of the Mosh pit and of Metal fandom. Bailoff works similar magic on other classics like \\"And than There Were None\\" and the band's possibly best song, \\"A Lesson in Violence\\".    Of course he is complimented by the truly awesome chainsaw shreds of Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt who set a standard with there form of playing. It's there guitar work, especially that of the classic \\"Piranha\\" that set the standard for Extreme Metal to follow.     This album's impact on the Extreme Metal scene is sometimes forgotten but a testament to it's success lies in the fact that the production of this album STILL sounds so modern nearly twenty five years after it's inital release.    Undoubtably, one of the 100 greatest Metal albums of all time and one of the most important and awesome of it's kind. A thrasher's collection would be for the worse without it.     Still, the one to measure Extreme Metal by.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|I just saw this film tonight after not seeing it for about twenty years. I was nine when this movie first came out in '86 and as a child it is one of my favorites. Films like Short Circuit are more than just movies for children of the 80's decade. This movie signifies a culture of movies that we could truly identify with and that made the world of 80's cinema unlike anything else Hollywood's ever created.    Short Circuit is a gem and if you love family entertainment then you will enjoy and appreciate it. Remember, this was in the mid-eighties before outrageous, computer-enhanced special effects, sex, violence and loads of unnecessary curse words took over the SCI-Fi/Action genre. Still, back then, Johnny Five was before his time. This is as clean as they come and one of the sweetest films ever made. If it weren't for a few curse words this movie would be a G.    I'm sure fans of anything 80's will love this movie and have already seen it multiple times. If you haven't, check it out but do not expect Short Circuit to be like the action films of today. It's entertaining, silly and at some points cheesy but that's things we loved about 80's films. So, if you're up for good clean fun then I definitely recommend Short Circuit. And if you're an 80's kid like me, this should be a film added to your DVD collection.
B000H5U832|5.0|This was purchased for a two-year old who loves trucks and cars. He never sat still before but he did for this movie!!! Amazing.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Having lived in OZ I found this film to be interesting and well done.  My wife and I enjoyed it as it brought back many fond memories of where we lived and seeing this land through the eyes of a young boy with all of the special effects was wonderful.  We recommend this film.
006092988X|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is such a great story and so eloquently written.  Anyone who is a native New Yorker and/or has immigrant heritage should read this book
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Yet another amazing season that doesn't fail to disappoint. What made this season so great is when you didn't have Dexter to fall back on, you always had Miguel and his amazing performance.
B00005RIKI|5.0|Every song on this cd is as good as the other. Set aside for a second the huge hits if you can on this album though it covers half of the album 5/8 of the songs. Mississippi Kid is a great southern/whisky bar style feel to it and sounds just as good as the monster hits the same can be said for Thing's goin' On, and I Ain't the one.......... If you want a true southern rock classic album / just a flat out great rock album this is a must have in your collection. Also one I might add will see  reoccurence in the stero or cd player. It certainly has in my case and I am a fan of every genre of rock.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I saw this classic many years ago when it first came out in 70 mm on a gigantic screen in San Francisco and was blown away.  Since then and periodically I have revisited this classic and have come to the conclusion that had David Lean never made another movie after this--he would still be considered one of the genius of cinema.  Keep in mind that this film influenced a young Steven Spielberg to enter the field of filmmaking (in fact he and Martin Scorsese had contributed to its restoration). And Peter O'Toole's debut performance is still one of the greatest ever captured on film!!  But that doesn't detract from the other fine actors in the cast such as the 74 yr old Claude Rains still vibrant, a brilliant Anthony Quinn, the cynical Arthur Kennedy as a disguised Lowell Thomas reporter and in his debut, Omar Sharif who becomes Lawrence's best friend and ally.  Aurally and visually arresting with much food for thought,\\"Lawrence Of Arabia\\" deserves to be in the top ten of great films that the AFI have designated along with \\"Godfather\\" and \\"Citizen Kane\\".
B00127RAJY|3.0|This is a good work and you really are going to feel it if you follow her instruction and push yourself. However, the DVD setup doesn't let you skip the copyright warning and her introduction, which adds up to about three minutes each time. If you are busy like me, three minutes is all I need to wash my baby's bottles, or do laundry. So, I will switch to some other exercise DVD once I reach Level 3 (I'm at Level 2 right now).
1401923119|2.0|I made my way throught the whole book waiting for the chapter that would tell me how to put all this into practice....it never came.  Instead what I got was a page that has his 3 CDs for sale and a website for Psych-K that offered to tell me how to do it if I spent a lot of money.  Seems to me if Mr. Lipton was truly concerned about the future of humanity, this information would be given freely with an open heart.  That in itself makes me suspicious of his motives.  But then again, I'm sure I already know his motive: $$$.    Also, this book could have been less than 100 pages long and still gotten across all of the relevant science he presents.
B000YABYLA|5.0|You have to get this movie if you enjoy what I call stupid humor. Had me rolling with laughter the whole first part of it. Good movie!!
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Season 1 really drew me in from the first episode, a love at first sight kind of scenario.  This is by far the best series I've seen in a while.  The complex relationships between man and machine, and even mother and son are tested throughout each outing.  To add to that, the chemistry of Summer Glau and Thomas Dekker is mesmerizing, and is probably enough to get any teenager interested.  However, their relationship digs much deeper than the average boy meets girl scenario... Any fan of action, drama, and science fiction will easily be fascinated by what this show has to offer.  More than just a ploy to get some cash from the Terminator name, the series stretches well beyond the boundaries of the films.  Tapping into deep philosophies in unison with beautiful action sequences...the show mirrors great films like The Matrix while respectfully keeping to a Terminator based storyline. The series does not serve as a continuation of the films, rather an extension on a different pathway. This frees up the writing and allows creativity to flow. Despite only having nine episodes, this season makes up for it by putting incredible quality into each episode.  The special features are awesome as well, seeing how much work and care was put in really made me appreciate the episodes even more...and seeing the cast and crew sharing their experiences was very entertaining as well. As far as accessibility is concerned, my mom isn't an action fan or a science fiction fan and she watched 6 episodes straight last night...my sister has taken interest as well after seeing how captivated it has me :)  Need anymore convincing? Buy this NOW :)
B00000F14B|5.0|I purchased \\"The Music Man \\" movie for a client who wants to watch this movie everyday that she is at our facility. I have been told by family that it is watched everyday at home as well. The movie was received in \\"Perfect\\" condition.      Thanks,  Peggy
B000LC55F2|2.0|I have enjoyed most all of the movies that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman have done, so I thought that with the two of them together this film would be a great one. It wasn't. I couldn't keep track of the plot after a certain point, and it quickly devolved into the two of them just trying to one-up each other, like two kids arguing over whose dad is better. I never felt any positive emotions from anyone and I ended the movie feeling kind of depressed. Not the way I like to leave a movie. It was also incredibly dark during certain parts which made it a little more difficult to see what was going on. Mainly, this movie confused and upset me.
B000YD7F10|5.0|Desperado is one of those albums where everything sounds right. The Eagles had already released their great first effort the year before but this is when their songwriting reached real high altitudes. The album is full of gems such as Tequila Sunrise, Doolin-Dalton, Desperado, Outlaw Man to name but a few.   It's also masterfully produced by Glyn Johns and recorded in 1973 at Island Studios in London. The artwork depicting a scene back in the Old West is also worthy of a praise.   Let's put it this way: out of the six albums they released in the seventies, Desperado might only be compared to Hotel California in terms of perfection.
B00007GZQZ|1.0|There was not anything even remotely funny about this movie. Constant disasters costing more money---how is that amusing? I see it as a disaster film. I know if this kind of thing was happening to me I would not be able to see it as humorous; just painful. I left the room in protest the first time I saw this movie, and when I decided to try and watch it again a few years later, I was reminded of why I left. In addition to the disasters befalling the house, the couple does not have a single ounce of chemistry between them, and towards the end it felt more like they were at war. Tom Hanks is a great actor, but this was definitely not one of his better movies.
B0001WTVUW|3.0|FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT I DO LIKE THE MOVIE, BUT THE THEME OF THE MOVIE IS \\"BETTER RED & DEAD THAN FIGHT\\"  DESPITE A CAST OF CHARACTERS THAT CONSISTED MOSTLY OF DOCTORS AND COLLEGE PROFESSORS AND SOME COLLEGE STUDENTS THE CHARACTERS WERE INCREDIBLY UNAWARE OF RADIATION & FALLOUT EFFECTS.    FROM THE ADS AT THE TIME OF THE ORIGINAL BROADCAST THE VIEWER WAS SUPPOSED TO WRITE THEIR CONGRESSMAN TO DEMAND DISBANDING OUR ARMED FORCES    ONE STRANGE THING ABOUT A PROGRAM DESIGNED BY FAR LEFT LIBERALS; THE PROTRAYAL OF BLACKS.  THERE ARE ONLY 3 BLACKS IN THE MOVIE.  A USAF MISSILE MECHANIC AND HIS WIFE WHO NEVER FIGURE OUT THAT THE MILITARY'S JOB IS TO FIGHT WAR AND IS NOT JUST A GOVERNMENT WELFARE/SCHOLARSIP PROGRAM.  WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTS AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS TRYING TO SAVE LIVES THE BLACK USAF MECHANIC INCITES THE REST OF THE USAF TO MUTINY AND FAILLING THAT HE DESERTS HIS POST.  THE THIRD BLACK IS A HOSPITAL ORDERLY PROTRAYED LIKE AN UNEDUCATED 1930's MISSISSIPPI SHARECROPPER ON \\"AMOS & ANDY\\" EXCEPT HE WAS FAR TOO STUPID TO BE AN \\"A&A\\" CHARACTER.  PERHAPS HE WAS TUTORRED BY JETHRO BODINE, EXCEPT HE LACKED THE INTELLECT TO LEARN UP TO JETHRO;S LEVEL.  IN THE 1980'S A BLACK CHARACTER THIS DUMB WOULD BE TOO POLITICALLY INCORRECT FOR A MISSISSIPPI REDNECK  BACKWOODS BAR..
B0000UJDLM|2.0|I honestly don't know why everyone likes this movie so much. Sure, it had some cute moments, but otherwise...eh. It's never kept my interest very long, and I can't even remember how the movie begins or ends. Everything about this film was just really plain.    I do like how WALL-E looks like Johnny 5 though.

B001DMJ9VA|4.0|In the early-to-mid-1970s, Rod Stewart was signed to Warner Brothers with The Faces and Mercury as a solo artist. As such, he ping-ponged between labels to meet his contractual obligations, but they were all essentially Stewart-Wood-McLagen-Lane-Jones productions. That body of work...from \\"The Rod Stewart Album\\" (1969) to \\"Smiler\\" (1974) and \\"First Step\\" (1970) to \\"Ooh La La\\" (1973) represents 11 of the strongest \\"Hall of Fame\\"-worthy albums ever released. The live Faces album, [[ASIN:B0000566R3 Coast to Coast - Overtures and Beginners]] was a kiss-off delivered by a long-depleted band. Lane had since departed, and former Free bassist Tetsu Yamauchi gamely filled in as they limped to the finish line. The album featured four unquestionably strong cover songs...Bobby Womack's \\"It's All Over Now,\\" Jimi Hendrix's \\"Angel,\\" The Temptations' \\"I Wish It Would Rain\\" and John Lennon's \\"Jealous Guy\\"...but the performances lacked any genuine heat.     Within short order, Stewart made the leap to full-time solo artist, minus his Faces band mates. Some would also say he sold out...songs like \\"Hot Legs\\" attempted to capture some of the old Stones-y Chuck Berry feel of prime Faces, but just came across as leering and smarmy, typical \\"rock star conquers all\\" tripe. Yes, that element was also at the center of several Faces songs...especially \\"Stay With Me\\" and \\"Miss Judy's Farm\\" from [[ASIN:B001TOAAJ2 Faces: A Nod Is As Good As a Wink...to a Blind Horse]], but what began as a good-natured \\"boys will be boys\\" commentary on the \\"band-meets-groupie\\" phenomenon soon wore thin. Frank Zappa walked the same turf on his albums [[ASIN:B00000E7N2 Fillmore East: June 1971]] and [[ASIN:B0000009SY Joe's Garage: Acts I, II & III]], with the difference being the depiction of the rock star as juvenile and detached rather than conquering and heroic. Stewart essentially lived up to Fee Waybill's \\"Quay Lude\\" fake rock star cartoon in real life.    The ultimate insult...\\"D'ya Think I'm Sexy\\"...is the one that had most die-hard fans yelling \\"traitor!\\"    But the records still sold, Stewart still worked the concert trail, and life went on. He had the hair, he had the clothes, he just lacked the heart of his earlier days, and the material ranged from acceptable to weak.    Then came \\"Unplugged.\\" The reason I've rated it at four starts instead of five is that Stewart still insisted on \\"stunt casting\\"...at the end of \\"Handbags & Gladrags,\\" the third track, Wood is introduced, and the crowd goes wild. What would have made it a five-star show? Wood on every song, for starters, and exclusive Faces-era material, rather than tracks like \\"Hot Legs.\\" And while Stewart performed admirably on the 1985 version of \\"People Get Ready\\" from Jeff Beck's [[ASIN:B00000260F Flash]] album, the strength of that version was based on it being an equal showcase for Stewart's voice and Beck's guitar. Cutting that equation in half makes it a bit pointless.    The single greatest moment of the show is when Wood recreates his original guitar solo from \\"Maggie Mae\\"...there's the missing heart. There's the thing that's missing from all of the \\"Great American Songbook\\" experiments.     Stewart has reunited with Wood on occasion since this concert, and there is a constant \\"on again, off again\\" rumor of a Faces reunion (impossible in the wake of Ronnie Lane's passing, but Stewart-Wood-McLagen-Jones will still sell out every stadium it touches).    Poetic justice at its finest...just like Jo Jo, Rod \\"got back to where he once belonged.\\" True fans of the Faces-era Stewart & Wood should also check out the excellent, essential box set [[ASIN:B0001Z2R96 Five Guys Walk into a Bar...]].
B00002E233|5.0|I find sharks to be fascinating creatures, and this movie showcases many of the things I find interesting about the. Although CG and models, the sharks are so well done that I keep forgetting they are not real! The actors are all superb in their roles--I like the chef the best. The dialogue and plot flow smoothly, and while the ending is rather over-the-top, it still makes sense and works well while you are watching. On a side note, the film really made me think about genetics work and the ethics involved. Very well thought out, and kind of frightening in its real world implications.    Great movie that I watch at least once a month. I love it!
B000NXVS96|5.0|I have to say, this is one of the funniest books I have ever read. I loved the movie as well because Renee Zellweger is SO hysterical in it (as well as committed, since she purposely gained 30 pounds for the part-now that is dedication. As most Chick-lit readers and authors know, this book by Helen Fielding practically invented the genre, and her success is well-deserved. If you happen to be the type who burns up everything you cook, eats, drinks and smokes too much, alwasy is in a bit of trouble and notoriously chooses the wrong men, you have to read this book.[[ASIN:1439217041 My Husband Ran Off with the Nanny and God Do I Miss Her]] by Tracy Davis (that would be me) You will love it! It's bridge with kids!
B00006FDCD|4.0|As far as horror movies go, this one has never really scared me. It is an entertaining film to watch, with good acting, good special effects, and good storytelling. Nothing really earth-shaking about it. The dialogue flowed smoothly, and although the ending felt a little hokey, it didn't harm the rest of the movie. You can enjoy this film even if you are not Stephen King fan.
031606792X|2.0|Ah, the end of the Twilight series.  Like eating junk food, it's not good for us but it sure is fun, and we just can't stop.  Book 4 was fairly satisfying, in tying up loose ends. I don't think the author is sophisticated enough to NOT do that. It has the same strengths and weaknesses as the first three books:  foreplay is well described, and still very much G-rated; plot lines are predictable; the grammar is horrid.  You'd think by the fourth book, she'd have enough advisers on her team to come up with decent names for the  newest member of the Cullen family.
B000H5U832|5.0|I'm very impressed by this company. I recieved my DVD in 3 days and in perfect condition as promised. I will definetly order from them again.
0140120416|2.0|Service from the seller was good.  I found the book too academic and too disjointed in the way it's been put together.  It attempts to do too much in too small a book.  The first two chapters are helpful in learning the alphabet & pronunciation and the first 4 appendices at the back of the book are useful.  I would probably use this if I couldn't find an understandable explanation in my other Russian books.  Overall I would not recommend the book for beginners.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I rented this film and was not expecting such a thrill ride.  2005 came out with an exciting adaptation of Frank Miller's exciting graphic novel, Sin City, based on three of Miller's immensely popular and immensely gritty books (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard).<br /><br />I was first struck by the photography: the black & white noir, harkens back to Dashell Hammet's gritty crime scenes, a Mickey Spillane (crime novel writer to you kids) special.  The color'd items popped into view: green eyes, red lips and occasionally white blood -- decapitations and body limbs flying not withstanding.<br /><br />Jessica Alba is hot in this picture, just seeing her in the cowboy outfit rates a couple of stars right there.  Bruce Willis, the tough, arrogant cop framed for a rape/murder he did not commit, a linking of tale and trouble, seemless in its execution.<br /><br />I liked the guy who was in love with Goldie, who was murdered in his bed as she slept; the mysterious fella with the Harry Potter look who ate the souls (and flesh) of whores -- shivering in me timbers, I was.<br /><br />[SPOILER} Some parts were hard to follow:  Who was the guy in the beginning who murdered the woman on the balcony and who later appeared at the end of the film to confront our traitoress in the elevator?  [END SPOILER)<br /><br />Frank Miller took \\"funny books\\" and made them exciting entertainment; later adaptation of 300 was his next big one.  Funny, I like S.C. better.<br /><br />Read the novel and then watch this film.  Also check out the DVD extra on Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino's take on the film.<br /><br />Suggest:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1593963149 Frank Miller's Complete Sin City Library]]<br />[[ASIN:B001RHGRT8 The Spirit]]<br />[[ASIN:B000QXDED6 300 (Widescreen Edition)]]

B0006J28BO|4.0|Another wonderful animated piece by Studio Ghibli, more for younger audiences like My Neighbor Totoro it's a nice 75 minute movie that's entertaining from start to finish.     Makes a good addition to your Ghibli collection as a funny light hearted tale about a girl who learns to have confidence in herself and not let the world decide who she is going to be.
031606792X|4.0|Not as good as Eclipse, but entertaining and heart-warming, nonetheless. I could do without a lot of the unnecessary details [much like I noticed in New Moon], but I looked forward to Bella's internal dialogue, especially with regard to her feelings about Renesmee.
B00000ILDF|1.0|Rarely is the sequel better than the original, so expectations were high after Aliens proved this assertion dead wrong.  Alien 3, without Cameron at the helm, was a dismal and disjointed attempt at sucking the blood out of the franchise.  With Sigourney Weaver objecting to being filmed with guns around her, script writers changing at a moment's notice, and budgets slashed, this was a disaster waiting to happen.  And it did.  Pointless elimination of Newt and Hicks, characters that made Aliens the great movie that it was, drove away the fan base.  Sigourney Weaver's primadonna demands that there be no guns combined with ever changing cast of screenwriters ended up in a heap of celluloid not worth wasting one's 2 hours of life on.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Few actors have ever fallen as far from grace as Mickey Rourke. After a string of lead performances in the 1980s, he almost completely disappeared for almost twenty years. As Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson and Pam (otherwise known as the stripper Cassiday) agree, the eighties were great while the nineties sucked. And just as The Ram's wrestling career peaked with his fight against The Ayatollah in the late eighties (otherwise known as Bob the used car dealer), so Mickey Rourke's career as a leading man ended at that time as well. When mentioned at all, Rourke was known as the victim of some remarkably bad plastic surgery or his forays into boxing. He did achieve some success as the brutish Marv in SIN CITY, but he still wasn't fully back. But 2008 was clearly the year of the comeback. Robert Downey Jr.'s return was widely and loudly heralded (as well it should have been), but it is dwarfed by Rourke's return. In fact, THE WRESTLER brought Rourke his first Oscar nomination. Interestingly, one of his best upcoming roles will be as the villain Whiplash in IRON MAN II, so the two comeback kids will appear together.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke is so incredible as The Ram that it is almost impossible to imagine he was not the first choice to star in the film. First choice was reputedly Nicholas Cage, but he left the project early on due to creative differences. Second choice was Sylvester Stallone, who was busy working on ROCKY BALBOA. But as these things so often do, it seems that everything worked out for the best. Undoubtedly Rourke's performance in SIN CITY brought sufficient positive attention to garner the best role not merely in twenty years, but of his career.<br /><br />The story is one that anyone can love. Someone who had once been on top now has fallen so low that he even gets locked out of the junky trailer he lives in. His daughter won't talk to him and even his partially successful attempts to rekindle a relationship come to nothing when he once again disappoints her. His body is betraying him and is completely broken down. He wheezes when he breathes, he wears a hearing aide, and he can barely creep along down sidewalks. He is clearly someone at the end of the line.<br /><br />The film is mainly filmed with a handheld camera. The dynamics of a film using a handheld camera are completely different than one using a stationary or track camera. In the latter, the actor has to play to the camera, being conscious to stay on his or her marks. With a handheld camera, the camera plays to the actor. There are many long scenes in the film where the camera follows Randy for long distances down hallways and sidewalks. Or back and forth as he performs his day job. The result is more of a documentary feel the makes it easy for the viewer to feel like they are there.<br /><br />THE WRESTLER also gives Marisa Tomei one of her best roles in years. I've always liked her and have felt that she was unjustly criticized for winning the Oscar for MY COUSIN VINNY. She gave a lovely performance in that role, but for some reason each year at Oscar time her win is cited as one of the least deserved wins ever. I find that absurd. An undeserved win would have been if Sylvester Stallone had won Best Actor for RAMBO. Like Rourke, Tomei has been getting a lot of nominations for her role as the aging stripper Cassiday. I may as well say what everyone I know who has seen this comes out and says. She spends a good amount of the movie undressed. Any 20-year-old woman in the world would die for her body. Well, without the tattoos (which were pretty obviously fake). Like Rourke, Tomei got a nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the Oscars and should have a decent chance of winning.<br /><br />This was one of the best films I've seen in 2008 and my favorite Darren Aronofsky film ever. The film won several awards either for Best Film (such as the Venice Film Festival) and Best Actor. Regardless of awards, this is a great movie that I strongly recommend. And Mickey Rourke's performance alone makes the film a must-see.the film a must-see.

B001VIMCW4|1.0|I really would like my money and my time back for watching this movie. It was one disappointment after another, this was movie making 101 Grade School. Did the editors even see the finished product? What ever happened to making one scene go with the other. I like action but only If i can figure out whats going on! when you think of James Bond you think best movie of the year, this was the worst movie in the last 2 years. Inexcusable, I'm sure the producer didn't even try to make it better. What was the point of this movie?
B001ILFUDM|5.0|The whole package is just wonderful. Clear and bright. Much of the commentary is so insightful. But the restoration and the overall look and feel of this dvd is just beyond what I had expected. And it is such a good movie. Of all the Disney movies, I am of the mind that this is, arguably, the most finely detailed animated feature. I have not taken advantage of all the extras but am looking forward to doing so. And Disney's addition of a regular non-bluray disc (and Amazon's discount) makes the few dollars extra more than worth the price. This is a keeper.
0596522347|5.0|From the folks who did Al Gore's \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" comes the backstory on creating and displaying a message. I'm a fan of Garr Reynolds, Olivia Mitchell, Seth Godin and Cliff Atkinson with homage to Guy Kawasaki. The Duarte's are held in such high respect by these that I had to see for myself. In the book, Nancy Duarte gives examples and teaches through examples of work they have done. It was fascinating and worth the effort. I have to use PowerPoint in a government context, and not all in the book will relate to this use. However, basic storytelling is adaptable to most any message, and I commend this book.
1840225564|5.0|This is the second time I've ordered this book. Sadly, the first time they were unable to get the book for me. I tried again a year later, again there were delays but when the book finally arrived I was delighted. For years I've been looking for a nice library edition of Jane Austen novels for my own collection. This beautiful, cloth bound, gold-leaf engraved book is well worth the wait. As others have already described the book perfectly, I'll not be redundant. The size of the book is a bit larger than any of my Bibles, but remember there are seven books in this one volume. I expected it to be large and it is, but not too heavy. I also expected the print to be quite small and was delighted to find that the print was of average size and easily legible. It is a lovely book I will treasure and pass along to my granddaughter.<br /><br />Final note, had this book been bound in leather, the price would have easily been four times what we paid for this book. Good value!
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I'm not a big Spielberg fan (I'm more for Kubrick and Burton), but I really do enjoy his classic films. Jaws is one of them. This is one of those old thrillers that you simply CANNOT miss. Yeah yeah, everyone knows that not all sharks are dangerous (we scare them more than they scare us), but this is a MOVIE. And boy is it a movie! It's not only the classic scares that make the film, but the characters Brody and Quint and Hooper are all equally interesting. It's almost a spectacle when these men of different backgrounds try to take down the big one in the second half of the film. Plus, the dialogue is easily recognizable (\\"I got no spit.\\"). The one thing that bothers me about this film is that the shark kills my favorite character near the end. What a shame.<br /><br />But other than that, this classic remains a classic. The sequels . . . meh. Part Three was good, but Parts Two and Four are the weakest.<br /><br />A-

B003H9M1QM|5.0|The wait is over, after more than a year of being delayed, Dumbo is finally available in all HD glory and what a release it is!!<br /><br />Dumbo was Walt's fourth film but is also one of the most remembered, well-known and loved movies that has come from the studio. It's simple short story about a little elephant with big ears that overcome all the obstacles to become a success is still as poignat, cheerful and delightful as it was 70 years ago. The film is Disney's shortest and yet is more powerful than many other films that run more time than this one. The relationship between Dumbo and his mother is both happy and heartbreaking and you can't help but being deeply moved in the \\"Baby Mine\\" sequence even if you've seen it several times. Also, this movie showcases one of the best surreal sequences ever put into film: \\"Pink Elephants on Parade\\" is wacky, beautiful and nonsensical in a wonderful way. Values like friendship, love, courage and more are all over the film and makes it even stronger and better.<br /><br />Dumbo is simply a classic.<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />Dumbo arrives on BD looking absolutely spectacular. The restoration given to this film is up there with other Disney films like Fantasia, Snow White and Bambi; it's simply amazing. Colors are well reproduced and pop out the screen, clarity and detail is sharp and contrast is strong. Even better, there are no signs of damage or compression artifacts. The transfer is breathtaking.<br /><br />In the audio department Dumbo sports a robust 7.1 DTS-HD MA which won't rock your living room but has not tampered with the original mono. Clarity again is striking and directionality is well reproduced. For purists, the restored monoaural soundtrack is also included.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br />There is plenty of bonus features bothe new and old that you will enjoy:<br /><br />First you have Cinema-Explore mode in which you can see the movie with a visual PIP commentary by Pete Docter, Paula Sigman and Andreas Deja. The PIP presentation is very well done, engaging and should not be missed. In here, the trio discusses the production of Dumbo, its style, release and success. Very interesting.<br />Then you have a making of documentary \\"Taking Flight: The Making of Dumbo\\" which is essentially an extension of the PIP comentary but it's also very interesting to watch.<br />Then you have a newly discovered deleted scene \\"The Mouse's Tale\\" and a newly discovered deleted song \\"Are you man or mouse?\\" You also have a short featurette called \\"The Making of Dumbo: A Ride of Passage\\" which discusses the legacy and endurance on one of the most popular rides at Disneyland.<br /><br />Carried over from previous releases are the featurette \\"Celebrating Dumbo\\", \\"Walt Disney TV Introduction\\", \\"Sound Design Excerpt from The Reluctant Dragon\\", an Art Gallery and trailers.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts<br />Dumbo is one of Disney's most beloved classics and its impact hadn't diminished in its 70 years of existence.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|Lost in Austen allows the reader to actually enter the world of P&P.  Every girl dreams of it, even if we don't admit it publicly, we all wonder if we could have Darcy for ourselves.  Through Amanda Price, we the reader can finally succeed in this endeavor.  Austen purists may look down their nose at the film, but to the plain ole' Austen enthusiast it is simply another wonderful twist on the best possible story.  I wonder if there is more of the story in the works?  I for one would love to see what happens next!  Elizabeth?  Darcy?  Amanda?  Caroline?  Wickham?  So much was left open, I for one hope they keep going!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|The Lion King began as a B project at Disney Animation Studios where everywhere wanted to work at the next \\"hit\\" Pocahontas. Who would have known that it will become the highest grossing tradional animated film of all time? Who would have known it would win two oscars and three golden globes? Even more important, who would have known than this supposedly secondary project will become one of Disney's most treasured films and the epitome of the Disney Renaissance? Well that's because The Lion King is not your usual regular animated film. It's one of the best animated films ever made with a complex and great story, unforgettable characters, a superb score and great music that elevates it and proudly stands with the best films ever made.<br /><br />I got to know the movie in my chiildhood when I was 4 years old and since then, The Lion King has been one of my favorite films. From its glourious beginning (which by the way I think is the best opening ever) to its final battle and resolution, the movie provides top-notch entertainment to everyone. The characters are great and stays with you and the film showcases one of the best villains that had graced the screen. Hans Zimmer score aided by Lebo M., is amazing, it just envelops you in the film's atmosphere and never let you go until the magnificent finale.<br /><br />Finally, this classic has made its long awaited Blu-ray debut in Disney's premium Diamond Line and the results are spectacular!!<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />WOW!! The Lion King looks absolutely breathtaking on HD. The transfer is immaculate with vivid colors, strong detail and amazing contrast. You will be amazed by how clear is the image and you'll discover new things that you have never seen.<br /><br />The 7.1 DTS-HD MA is as strong and superb as its video counterpart. The sound is bombastic and really strong. Dialogue is clear and wait 'till you see the opening scene and you will be completely in awe. An amazing audio presentation.<br /><br />Bonus Features<br />While this set is not as loaded as previous Diamond films like Beauty or Sniw White, there are still plenty of interesting stuff to watch.<br /><br />\\"Disney Second Screen\\" allows you to sync the film with your ipad or laptop in order to see galleries, games, storyboards and more. While this is nice is does not work as good as it sounds.<br /><br />You also have an audiocommentary with producer Don Hahn and directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff which is interesting to watch.<br /><br />\\"Pride of The Lion King\\", which is the best bonus in this set, is a retrospective documentary about the production of the film. Many of the people involved share their thoughts of what the film meant to them and also how thd Broadway musical came to be. A must see!!<br /><br />\\"The Lion King: A memoir- Don Hahn\\" Is a retrospective look by the producer whonlooks back at him in 1994 and how The Lion King came to be. Another must-see!!<br /><br />\\"Deleted and alternate scenes\\" feature five deleted scenes introduced by the directors.<br /><br />\\"The Morning Report\\" is a fully animated scene that was inserted in the film in the Platinum DVD but it now appears on its own. I think that is good because I did not like it at all.<br /><br />\\"Bloopers & Outtakes\\" is a newly-created setof bloopers featuring the characters evocating the Pixar films. While this are funny, they are not as funny as the Pixar ones.<br /><br />\\"Interactive Art Gallery\\" is a great compilation of character design images, storyboards, development, etc.<br /><br />\\"Sing along mode\\" is the usual karaoke-like feature where you can sing the film songs.<br /><br />\\"Disney's Virtual Vault\\" is the highly impractical online feature that houses all the material from the Platinum DVD. At least they included the material.<br /><br />This set is the two disc BD/DVD combo which I think is the ideal release without paying for a gimmicky format and a pointless conversion.<br /><br />A DVD copy is also included.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts<br />The Lion King is a masterpiece and one of the best animated films ever made. Dealing with themes like death, loss, guilt, responsibility, love, family and more, this film stands tall as one of Disney's best films. This BD set is a perfect way to enjoy it with spectacular picture & sound and plenty of great bonus features that makes it one the best BD sets and is Very Highly Recommended!!sing Thoughts<br />The Lion King is a masterpiece and one of the best animated films ever made.

B001FB55YE|4.0|This movie is great to watch.  It is a pleasure visually, specially in full HD.  The scenes are typical Guy Ritchie, which is always funny in an interesting kind of way.    I definitely think I like the story behind Snatch or Lock Stock better, but this one is just so cool to watch!    Also, the Digital Copy worked as advertised on my Macbook and AppleTV as an alternate option (but as mentioned above, watch it full HD).    Definitely a must.

0743298039|5.0|An absolutely fantastic piece of literature that had me up for hours. A story that you find yourself thinking about throughout the day, pondering the same questions as the characters.

Congratulations to Diane Setterfield on an amazing tale.

140120841X|1.0|V for Vendetta is a great disappointment.  It appears to be printed on low-quality paper, with the result that the experience of reading it is not much different from reading the color page of a newspaper comics that has been left in the sun so long that the colors have faded to the point that it's sometimes hard to follow the action.  This product is in marked contrast to other Alan Moore graphic novels in paperback, such as WATCHMEN and THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, where the illustrations are on glossy paper and the images are clear and powerful.  Don't buy the paperback edition of V FOR VENDETTA if you're looking for that kind of crisp, clear illustration.  I am told that the hardcover edition is on glossy paper and therefore much preferable to the paperback version.
0201626632|4.0|I read this to see whether to recommend it to graduate and undergraduate students in the sciences that attend my university.  The author is a well-credentialed scientist at Sandia National Laboratory.<br /><br />There are many opinions presented that people considering or attempting a career in scientific research should know.  Interviews, preparing talks, choosing what to publish and how, research plans, weighing various career options - all these topics are addressed.<br /><br />Some opinions differ from mine, most notably his preference for government labs like his over universities, but common sense generally prevails.  The prose was vaguer than I prefer, much of it seemed obvious, perhaps because I've already been there.  A few times it was obvious this dates to 1993.<br /><br />Overall, I prefer the book Academeology (google it) by \\"Female Science Professor\\", which nails the university life with much greater accuracy and precision.  Aspiring scientists should really read both, and go into their careers with their eyes open.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|This is an excellent album.    As others here have mentioned, this release is not as 'metal' as their previous releases but this is a huge leap for this band.  The music is tight as hell, complex, densely layered, and progressive.  The sound, production and track layout are all amazing.  As an old metal head, I thought their other CDs were 'cool' to listen to now and then.. but this one is very addictive.    They mentioned that they recorded it and then went on the road with it... the extra time they spent on this album really paid off.  There are a lot of fantastic subtleties on this CD.    Imagine this: Tool + Killing Joke + The Melvins + King Crimson + Metal Church + Rush ... but with Mastodon's original tunes and sounds wrapped around it all.  This is a killer, very original, concept album.  I can't wait to hear where they go from here.    The included DVD is also very good... it provides a deeply personal, thoughtful context for the overall CD and each song.  A few of them had some profound life experiences which influenced the making of this CD.  To be honest, I thought it would be a waste of a DVD... some cheesy bar performances, etc.  It was not cheesy, by any measure... it really caught me off guard.    This band is doing an amazing job of finding its way to the next tier of performance, imagination and production.  Between the CD and the DVD, I have an enormous amount of new respect for this group.  Again, this is an excellent album.  Purchase it --> support these guys.  I can't wait to see them on this 'Crack The Skye' tour.

B001TOD92C|5.0|I found that the wrestling scenes didn't over take the movie as I expected going in to it.  Them going into \\"The Rams\\" background made this more of a character piece with the wrestling scenes thrown in here and there.  The only wrestling scene that might make some people cringe a bit was the hardcore match he had near the middle of the movie.  I congratulate Mickey Rourke for such a great performance. Rourke isn't the only one that makes the movie.  Performances by Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood helped take this movie to another level.  I would recommend The Wrestler to anyone.

B000OZ2CUC|4.0|This DVD has a good selection of Dylan's different guitar styles, and the instructor does a good job of breaking them down and walking you through them step by step.  My only complaint is that he goes a little too fast sometimes, and there is no guitar tab displayed on the screen, which a lot of other guitar instruction DVDs have.
B00006BSC8|2.0|So what did we learn from this film?  That there are some surprising uses for a piece of raw liver.  That we should beware of Grandfather.  That fear can be something so deep within us that no stratagems can conquer it.  That there are really stoopid people who fish in the most polluted river imaginable. Yes, the St Lawrence and Rivière des Prairies are kinda bad but when I lived for nine years in Montreal, I never saw anything like the one in the movie.   That it's not good for parents to have weird obsessions, it tends to create problems in the children - especially if the children share an inherited tendency towards mental disorder.  That unlike the US, Canada takes care of disturbed people without bankrupting them or throwing them out in the street. (But we knew that).  That filmmakers can make a truly bizarre movie which *seems* to hang on a theme  (if you can find it) and get a lot of praise from those who enjoy being grossed out.    Two stars for sheer wacky originality and good filmcraft, but no more because of its incoherence.
B000TEPKAW|5.0|The \\"Heroes\\" album in its entirety isn't necessarily going to be for everyone's taste but even if your palate doesn't quite reflect my own, there are a number of choice tracks with broad appeal.<br /><br />\\"Heroes\\" was the second album of what is in retrospect called the Berlin trilogy. The first of that trilogy, [[ASIN:B000TENMNY Low]], is probably my favorite Bowie; \\"Heroes\\" was a strong followup that provided a more jarring approach in constrast to the meditative and sometimes drifting melancholy of its predecessor. Both are among the most important albums of Bowie's career.<br /><br />If you've ever picked up one of the many [[ASIN:B00006JYI7 compilations of Bowie hits]] you've probably gotten the edited version of the title hit. Somehow \\"Heroes\\" doesn't sound right when it opens with the verse about swimming like dolphins. The most memorable lyrics are right there in the first verse of the full length version included here. The opening phrase that starts,<br /><br />\\"I, I would be king, and you, you can be queen...\\"<br /><br />But just in case the listener gets too carried away with the princess delusion, Bowie makes sure it gets right back down to earth...<br /><br />\\"And you, you can be mean, and I, I'll drink all the time...\\"<br /><br />The album opens with one of Bowie's choicest songs ever, the harrowing \\"Beauty and the Beast\\". That and \\"Heroes\\" are the two most accessible vocal numbers on the album. What used to be side two of the album is made up of four instrumentals, followed by one more vocal to wrap things up. \\"V-2 Schneider\\" will have the broadest appeal of the instrumentals. Those who had some Bowie's 45s from this era may remember it as a b-side as well. The song is a tribute to Florian Schneider of Kraftwerk, a kind of mutual recognition after Kraftwerk namechecked Bowie and Iggy Pop in the title song of their classic 1977 [[ASIN:B002PXFMUI Trans Europe Express]].<br /><br />\\"Sense of Doubt\\" is a foreboding instrumental that someday will make its way to a film soundtrack I'm sure. It flows right into \\"Moss Garden\\", an evocative, atmospheric piece that is appealing as either foreground or background ambience. Close your eyes and you can almost feel the drips of water and the moisture in the air as you're transported to a peaceful solitude in some hanging gardens. This flows into the final instrumental, \\"Neukoln\\", which sounds like Bowie wrestling with his sax. What I appreciate most about this number is that so many lesser artists invoke the sax when they want a trite boogie sound or they want to, as Zappa put it, [[ASIN:B0000009TK \\"make a jazz noise here\\"]]. Bowie's treatment of the sax is entirely off the map compared to most performers' limited roles for this instrument. Nowadays I tend to have a scorn for that most predictable of instruments, the sax, but Bowie avoided the trap of tedium with \\"Neukoln\\".<br /><br />\\"Joe the Lion\\" and \\"Blackout\\" are jagged, angular rockers which no doubt jarred the old fans of his pub rock Ziggy Stardust sound. These aren't the most easily digested Bowie numbers for the casual fan accustomed to commercial radio fare, but numbers like this kept Bowie interesting and cemented his credibility in the face of the upcoming generation of punk rockers. As the promotional materials of the day read, \\"There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie\\".<br /><br />If, upon listening to the samples you find that you might prefer a more accessible Bowie album, I strongly recommend [[ASIN:B000TDDIC0 Station To Station]] from the previous year, 1976. Only six songs but every song is top shelf Bowie, and the title track in particular is a showstopper. Or if you're more inclined toward the power crunch of guitar rockers, check out that little atom bomb, [[ASIN:B000XFCPIM Aladdin Sane]]. [[ASIN:B000XFECLU Diamond Dogs]] from 1974 is a fan favorite as well, perhaps the most eloquent, eerie and erotic of Bowie's apocalyptic albums.<br /><br />Just be warned, Bowie's best albums act like a gateway drug. Land one of those and before you know it you've picked up a half dozen more Bowie albums. Keep it up and you find that the Bowie section of your CD collection takes up a whole shelf in itself. Given this legacy, that's a very good thing.ike a gateway drug. Land one of those and before you know it you've picked up a half dozen more Bowie albums.

0375826726|4.0|If you enjoyed Eragon and Eldest, you can't miss out on this book. I'm still finishing it up, but I've quite enjoyed it. The only reason I withhold the fifth star is that, while Paolini is clearly a good writer, I wouldn't say his ideas are that original. In fact, they have pretty strong parallels to other series' like Lord of the Rings. But, all fantasy books seem to have a lot of similarities.
B001TH16DI|1.0|BE warned, these are the theatrical editions of these movies.    A few days ago, NewLine announced the LOTR trilogy on blu-ray and yes, it too is the theatrical edition only. This is because they are 'working' on the extended editions for later release. The same extended editions that have been on DVD for years have apparently been sitting and are somehow not ready for blu-ray.  And now, the Star Trek original movies that were enhanced, cleaned up, and extended for DVDs a few years ago are suddenly not clean enough or ready for HD and will come later.    ENOUGH ENOUGH ENOUGH!
0590402331|5.0|Who doesn't love this book? All the \\"If you give a....\\" books are fun for kids, and also useful if you are teaching lessons on cause and effect.
B001PPGAIK|3.0|The only reason I did not give this movie a 5 Star Rating is due to the cost.   The color and resolution and audio were outstanding and very enjoyable.  But I buy very few Blue Ray movies as the cost is excessively high. Even at the reduced rate that Amazon sells them for.
B00009W0WM|4.0|It's a classic. If you love classics, you'll love it. If you're one of the young, snobby-minded people who think today's crap outshines old films and you just can't handle watching anything without color, forget about it.
B000LPS47U|5.0|Ok, Here's the deal.  This is one hell of an original movie that is not your typical horror flick. Herbet West is a psychotic genius madman scientist who is able to reanimate the dead. He transfers after a mishap in his independent research lab in Switzerland to a medical school in the states. He quickly begins his experiments in the basement of a fellow medical student, where he succeeds in reanimating a dead cat (Who names their cat roofus anyways?). The madman quickly moves to the morgue and then killing humans for the sake of experimentation and an answer to blackmail. This movie is truly not your typical blood bath, yet features plenty of blood to satisfy any gorehound. Herbert West has found the answer to reanimating the dead with his glow in the dark serum, which is never really explained. Most of his experiements are greatly flawed and end in a bloody mess. At times this is very much over the top with its sick and twisted humor and even galavanting into headless sodomy. From a walking clumbsy corpse carrying its own head in a metal tray yearning for blood to decapitating a head with a shovel, the over the top gore is as intense as it is comical. The film progresses at a fairly fast pace and the ending leaves you wanting to see the sequel immediately. This is as good as it gets.
B001AEF6BI|4.0|A group of actors most popular from the 80's, before my time as I am only 15. It was cool to see these actors when they were younger, I have seen other movies they were in, but at their current age. This is high school, no matter where you live.  So much of what they did and said is true, even so many years later.  There were many life lessons in it, speaking teenager life.  Most kids are the way they are for a reason.
B00006EXCC|5.0|Beggar's Banquet was an artistic triumph; Let It Bleed had \\"Gimme Shelter\\"; this album employed the cliche, the best of the past, present, and future, in the best possible sense. All fourteen songs are from the group itself and the music never overpowers the lyrics.<br />\\"Mother's Little Helper\\" is the opener, a huge hit as we all know, a complex arrangement on a complex subject - this disturbing tome came before many similiar ones depicting a troubled sub-culture. But this number coyld have been placed *anywhere* on this great set.<br />The misanthropic \\"Out Of Time\\" was surely one of the best songs of the year - given away to another group.<br />\\"High And Dry\\" is another terrific track, offering something to Country fans as well; Johnny Cash or Bill Monroe might have a Top Tens with this opus.<br />An older Stones album cut is \\"The Singer Not The Song\\" and we have two tracks which initially seem negative and misogynistic: \\"Stupid Girl\\" is a forward-looking 4/4 Rock and Souler - actually more critical of the singer; \\"Under My Thumb\\" has less accent on the drumns but is even better poetry. Jagger sings well.<br />Was lookin' for \\"Sittin' On A Fence\\" - didn't see it - if it had made the cut, we may have had the only album in history to be *too* good.
B0002O06NA|5.0|Every song on this album is solid, with amazing blues/rock hooks. If you like Led Zeppelin or The Black Crowes, check this album out.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is miles ahead of the lame, saccharine, Mormonish, sexless, sanitized [[ASIN:B001P5HRMI Twilight]]. This is the REAL thing. This is a little Swedish film that is years ahead anything made in Hollywood these days within the Vampire genre.<br /><br />Little Oskar lives in a small Swedish town. It's Winter and he is bullied at school. Until he meets Eli, a girl who befriends him and teaches him to make a stand against his enemies. In the meanwhile, they both experiment with love. Oh, and by the way, she is a vampire.<br /><br />This little film captures childhood or pre-puberty as few others do. And on top of that, the horror is so tasteful and well introduced that the viewer is constantly on the edge of his seat without the need for the cheap scares we see in Hollywood these days.<br /><br />It is amazing how this film captures a kind of Winter mood, as everything seems to stop and be confined to the indoors (while Oskar constantly keeps going to the playground in order to meet Eli). I also loved the cinematography.<br /><br />But it is the directing, the screenplay and the actors who shine in this film. I did not need the subtitles and it a shame if they do not translate the dialogs accurately, because everything here is beautifully written.<br /><br />Truly amazing! The Europeans have done it again! Hallå Sverige!
1433502410|5.0|I have a half a dozen Bibles and this quickly became my favorite.  In addition to a clear and very understandable presentation of Biblical text, original words are usually noted in notes, and notes are very clear.  Pictures and other aides make Biblical study more meaningful and enjoyable.
044024367X|3.0|This new installment of Jack Reacher contains enough action blended with a complex plot to hold interest throughout the book. The questions raised by the events of the story are enticing, adding a dimension of energy and curiosity that consistently compels the reader to turn the page hoping to find answers. Jack Reacher himself is a hybrid of a L'amour Western character, a Mike Hammer persona, and a loner hero trying to right the wrongs of the world. He is tough and lacking in compassion when dealing with the \\"bad\\" guys, yet sensitive and caring to the weak and unfortunate.     Having read every Jack Reacher story, I found this one to be a bit wordy with excessive repetition in the events. At times, I felt as though I had already read a particular page due to its similarity to events of previous chapters. While Reacher is an able-bodied \\"fixer\\" of situations, he is not all that likable and seems to cause undue pain when confronted. His arrogance is rather charming and he often seems on the verge of donning a cape and becoming Captain America or Spiderman. In this story, Reacher's relentless pursuit of truth is admirable and we find ourselves championing his cause with him, knowing he will ultimately prevail.     Sometimes, however, the dialog is a bit stilted and unrealistic and the plotting seems unnecessarily complex. In addition, short sentences and predictable behavior come across as almost a young adult story rather than something for mature readers. How often do we read \\"Reacher said nothing\\" or \\"She said nothing?\\" These type of sentences give the book a stagnant and false quality that is only overcome in the action scenes. While not my favorite Reacher book, it is a page-turner and enjoyable to read as a \\"good guy\\" versus \\"bad guy\\" thriller. Although sort of fun, I am ready for Jack Reacher to develop some more character traits, and to right the wrongs without punching everybody out.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Talk about a terrific album!!! Ever since the release date on March 31, I haven't stopped listening!  Urban is well-known for his hopeful, feel-good songs, such as the hit \\"Somebody Like You\\" ; this album is wholly comprised of such songs- how fitting for the current times!  Much like his previous albums, this one is inadvertently designed for the optimistic realist; hope, joy, and fantastic music.  I highly recommend this album.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I loved all the music from the movie. I wished they could have added all of the songs from the movie to the soundtrack.
031606792X|1.0|Too bad Meyer had to break with the genius of her first 3 books.  The reader could conceive of a reality that includes the world of Twilight described in the first three books.  This book went off the deep end - I kept waiting for the aliens to descend from heaven.  New myths and vampire lore suddenly came into play like a last-minute inspiration, Bella lost her sarcasm, and the witty banter between her and Edward all but disappeared.  The entire book leads up to a climax that is never realized.
0743487486|5.0|A real eye opener on how to cherish little people and enable them to grow into assured, self confident adults. So many things that adults do to children, not realizing the detrimental effects they cause to a childs growth. I was skeptical at first, but once I got into the book I found it fascinating.
031606792X|2.0|(some spoilers here, but if you're read a good number of the reviews to this point, you would know already)    I'm not the teenage girl who is normally thought to be the audience for the Twilight series. I'm a 32-year-old man, and the Twilight series wrapped me in anyway. The series is not very well written - kind of disjointed, actually, with lazy lapses into terms like \\"he sighed\\" - but the characters are interesting, the romantic tension real, and the books hard to put down.    I had no problem reading through Breaking Dawn, but that's mostly because I like the series and I wanted to see how it ended. However, it was a disappointing end to the series. Bella is too self-deprecating anyway, but it gets unbearable in the first part of the book. I also felt no more magic in the wedding than the usual wedding. This is a book geared to young people, so I did not expect detailed accounts of sex - but the way Edward and Bella were depicted on their honeymoon was pretty cheesy. And since it states vampire women can't have babies due to their bodies changing, how can Edward help create one? Vampire men have a different number of chromosomes than human men, and no beating heart! And if the baby could stand human food as a child, why not in the womb? Also, when most of what you read about are Renesmee's thoughts getting shown, you don't get to know the character that well. Her traits were written predictably as a mix of vampire and human. One good thing is that she is an endearing character.    Jacob's part of the book was actually pretty funny, though time is wasted on imprinting. And Bella's narration improved during her third of the book when she became a vampire. She became a better, more cool character as a vampire. But anytime a conflict emerges or there's a build to a climax, there's a big letdown. With the shape shifters (thought to be the werewolves,) stupid imprinting negated the reason they exist - to protect the tribe and human life. At the end, I was left wishing that Bella and Edward did do something illegal and their group would defeat the Volturi. While happy endings are fine, everything was too perfect. Not even any arguments or anything. The ending was like a fairytale, and I didn't think of the series that way. It's a shame, because the author can actually create a mood of suspense quite well. If not for that gift, the book would be harder to read than it is. In summary, Breaking Dawn got distracted from the Bella and Edward chemistry that made the series good up to this point.    Here's how I'd rate each book -    Twilight - 4/5  New Moon - 3/5  Eclipse - 4/5  Breaking Dawn - 2/5
034544678X|2.0|It would have been a better book if there weren't so much talk about primates.  I want to read more about dogs and their owners, not so much about how humans are so much like monkeys.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|The vid work was great.All the B&W shows came out in bright crystal clear color.<br />But with this many CDs a book format is required.The cost effective bottle dodat sucks big time.I have already tossed it and put the CDS in plastic<br />sheets in a binder.This iconic hall of fame show deserved better.
B001ECQ6E2|5.0|Finally an excellent Blu-ray Disc DVD.  I was in High School when Quo Vadis was  originally released, and I remember that I liked it very much. It is certainly one of my favorite movies. The new  Blu-ray Disc DVD is terrific with great sound and crisp images. Great job.
1439136653|3.0|The book was interesting, showing how life is in India, but the book was depressing because of this very reason.  I knew that life for the \\"common people\\" was difficult in India but this showed how bad it really is. We all need to experience the truth of what happens in other countries and this was interesting because it was very revealing to the western world.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I'm new to KOL and am totally obsessed with this album.  I know it's very different then their previous albums, and this disappoints some fans.  But, I may not have listened to their old stuff if he had not been for this CD. I can't wait for the next one.
6301971272|3.0|I love The Good the Bad & the Ugly (along with all Leone's Westerns) but the 2-disc Collector's edition disappointed me. I was excited to see the extra footage that was in the original Italian version but after seeing it I quickly ran out and bought the older (original US version) DVD because the dubbing of Older Clint & Eli on the new scenes took me completely out of the movie (although I commend their efforts). To me it stands out like a sore thumb when you suddenly hear old mens voices coming from the young faces & I truly wonder if Leone would have wanted it released like this knowing it would sound like this. I wish they would have simply included the previous 'Original US release' cut without all the extra footage but with all the great color correction & sound mix. Hopefully in the future & on the Blu-Ray.<br /><br />5 stars for the movie - 1 star for the actors voice dubbing in the new scenes.
630463949X|5.0|THIS DVD IS EXCELLENT---I DID NOT REALIZE IT IS A TWO SIDED DISC, ONE IS DTS 5.1 AND THE OTHER STEREO.  I FIRST LISTENED/WATCHED IN STEREO AND WAS DISAPPOINTED BUT THEN CHECKED THE CASE AND FOUND IT'S TWO SIDED.  SOUNDS GREAT IN 5.1 OR 6.1
0066620996|4.0|Book is definitely worth reading. It provides a vision of management. The disciplines a company needs to follow in order to be out of queue of good companies and becomes great. I did not like the shipping time though. It took almost more than 10 days for the book to arrive after order. I didn't expect the shipping to take that long.
0375842209|5.0|This book is an amazing piece of literature. Well worth your time and money.  Written from the perspective of \\"Death\\", the story keeps you engaged and reading from cover to cover.  This is an outstanding selection for teen readers who are somewhat advanced in their reading skills, and a delight for adults.  It is particularly well representative of a different side of the Holocaust.  What was it like to be German during World War II?  Read on and find out!

B00243FQFA|5.0|Stargate Atlantis entering it's 5th season was filled with a lot of suspense, action, drama, and even the good ol Stargte comedy like Rodney delivering Teyla's baby. The show had a solid first part with the brilliant special effects of \\"Daedalus Variations\\" and the heart-felt tear jerker \\"Ghost in the Machine\\" and \\"The Shrine\\". Our friendly or foe wraith Todd makes a great appearance in \\"The Queen\\" where Teyla goes through a transformations.    The mid-season 2 parter was epic with a special guest appearance by Michael Shanks to fufill his role as Daniel Jackson. If you are a SG-1 and SGA fan it was an epic episode with a shocking discovery.    As the 2nd half progresses we get epic eps like \\"The Prodgial\\" which features an epic scene with Sheppard, Michael, and Teyla fighting on the balcony outskirt of the city Atlantis. Another worthy nod was \\"Outsiders\\" which features another episode of the returned Carson Becektt and gives a classic SGA feel with the character interactions. Best line, Mckay: \\"It's not a volkswagon Carson\\". Also a shot out at \\"Remnants\\" which dives into 3 characters, Woolsey, Sheppard, and Mckay, and features a clever plot twist.    The 2nd half dragged a little with the fueled shipping and relationship of Mckeller. I think that was the only downfall to the season. It felt a little rushed and forced but was not overkill in the season.    The series ends with the last 2 eps. A CSI feel Atlantis taking place in Vegas, titled, um \\"Vegas\\". Cool and interesting music selections from Producer Robert Cooper featuring, \\"Marilyn Manson\\", \\"The Rolling Stones\\", and \\"Johnny Cash\\". A very unique episode that really captures the heart and personality of one John Sheppard.     The series/season finale was rushed because of MGM's decision to replace Atlantis with Stargate Universe. A lot of fans were upset because Atlantis was still performing very well in ratings. So the producers, with no slots in their eps, had to quickly come up with a 100ep/Season finale/Series Finale all in one. Did they do it? Well not all the way. It should of been a 2-parter for a lot of fans taste, but it was a very good episode. Felt more like a season finale.    Season 5 was not the best season, but it was up there. Now with a Stargate Atlantis movie in the works and scheduled for a 2010 release it should be interesting how they continue the story where Season 5 left off this past Winter.     They don't have a 4 1/2 option so I'll just give it 5 stars!
B001V9LRTM|5.0|I agree that they should have used the original sound track.  I mean how could they re-do the Joe Cocker performance?  ;-)
B00008GKEG|5.0|I am a Beatles fanatic and loved this documentary.  Even at 10 hours, I still wanted more.  My wife is not a fanatic and still enjoyed every minute.  Highly recommended.
B001RTP3Z0|4.0|This is pretty much a bare bones DVD featuring extended London concert footage. I have no beef with the camera work. It is simple, but effective, and much preferable to so many concert videos where the camera moves so much and cuts from one angle to the next occur so quickly it threatens to  give one vertigo, or at least a headache.     The choice of 4:3 aspect ratio, in an era where even run-of-the-mill TV shows are widescreen, is inexplicable. The video quality is good, but not great. [A customer has reported that some sets offer a 16:9 version. That is good news, but be sure what you're getting before you buy. Mine is only 4:3. With a widescreen disc, I would bump up the rating to 4 1/2 stars.]    The audio could have been better. Happily, an uncompressed LCPM stereo track is available (the default) on the DVD, which should make for maximum sound quality. But the disc producers chose to muck this up, too. The sound is dynamically compressed, i.e. the soft parts are made loud so the dynamic contrast between soft and loud is blunted. When the band gets going full blast, the sound is congested -- it loses some clarity. Nevertheless, I would rate the sound as good, not great -- equivalent in sound quality to a musical segment on the Letterman show or Tonight Show on digital TV.     The concert is great, and Leonard is full of warmth and grit, whatever is called for. Leonard Cohen appears to be having the time of his life, and the band is perfect. His angelic choir, a trio of female backup singers, is magnificent. The guitarist provides Knopfler-esque lead lines, and his \\"wind instrument\\" and keyboard players add richness to the mix.     This is the perfect introduction to Leonard Cohen. It represents his best compositions (though I am disappointed that Joan of Arc is not part of the set list). At age 74 Cohen's voice is a bit husky, but these performances are as good as any I've ever heard on his studio albums or live material. (Granted, I do not have a large collection of Cohen albums, however I appreciate very much his songs, including those performed by other artists.) It's hard to imagine him ever topping this.     If you are unfamiliar with Leonard Cohen's music, it is generally quite simple, with common chord progressions and easy melodies. You might quickly find yourself singing along with these tunes. Cohen's strengths are his poetry and his delivery of the poetic line. He has always loved embellishing the simplicity of the songs with female choruses and fuller arrangements, while the structure retains the essence of folk music. Sometimes he favors a Spanish rhythm.     For me, this is the definitive Leonard Cohen live performance, much as Joni Mitchell's Shadows and Light concert DVD highlights her best songs and best performances a with dream team band. That DVD is also deficient technically, but the music shines through. So it is here. It's a five star concert with one star deducted for technical quality that does not measure up to the artistry of the performance.
B001TODCII|4.0|Perhaps it is the torturous and troubled times we live in. Perhaps it is because so many of us feel powerless so much of the time. Whatever the reason, it is hugely satisfying to watch Liam Neeson's cool and highly skilled ex-special operative take control of the horrifyingly dangerous situation his (extremely typical) teenage daughter puts herself in. The fact that she's traveling in Europe and far from her pampered American home sweet home, and the fact that he's a wounded divorced dad struggling to keep close connections with her, add exquisite pain and suspense to this taut thriller.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I have a confession.  I am a Sigur Ros fanatic.  Don't expect an \\"objective\\" review, whatever that might be.  I love music, all kinds of it, and much Sigur Ros's music ranks among my favorite music--  Period.  I first got hooked on Sigur Ros shortly after their breakthrough album, Agaetis Byrtun, was released several years ago.  This album, Takk, is beautiful and probably more accessible than some of their previous work.  The music is ambient, hauting, and utterly unique.  It is also music that is undeniably Icelandic, yet so much more.  I concur with another reviewer, who noted that with Sigur Ros, you either get it or you don't.  In any event, Takk is a beautiful album that is perhaps slightly more accessible than albums like its predecessor, ( ).      You owe it to yourself to give Sigur Ros a try . . .
0618918248|5.0|This book really changed my life. Coming from a religious background and having even pursued it adamantly when I was younger, reading this as an alternative turned into a veil being lifted from my eyes. I realized for the first time what a silly, stupid thing religion is and why it should be open to debate like any other subject instead of shied away from. My life has become a lot more free, happy and positive than the one I had in the shadow of a thunderous, angry god that was watching my every move and waiting to roast me till eternity for questioning or even doubting him - and please spare me the defense that god is good and kind and merciful because anyone who reads the holy books can tell you that this is wishful thinking. Mr Dawkins is a genius in my eyes - all the defenses and arguments that are presented as 'proof' of a divine being are demolished by his flawless logic and great intellect. I can only hope that a lot more people will read this and embark on a journey that has the promise of a wiser, happier and more humane life at the end of it.     Some people told me that the book is too aggressive and that it only reflects his own point of view. To that all I can say is - he wrote it to present his own point of view, not as a 'what is religion?' textbook so I see no problem there. And I don't find it aggressive. The arguments posed by fundamentalists are strikingly cliche and similar for almost every religion out there and I was shocked by how many I had never really thought about in depth but taken for granted and undeserved belief before this book shed a different light on it. As the most destructive force in the history of humankind religion deserves to be tackled as harshly as any war criminal guilty of genocide should - if not more. So don't expect a meek 'This is what I think but I respect other ideas, too' approach with this book. Mr Dawkins, I think, has good reason to go in with guns blazing.
B000FJGWBC|5.0|Into the Blue was not a disappointment. The best part about INTO THE BLUE was the direction. Seriously. There were actually some scenes that looked like Walker and Alba maybe just learned their lines THAT DAY. Other scenes seemed smoother, but you could actually tell that the actors were not familiar with the material and the dialogue seemed stilted and like... well... being an actor myself... it seemed like they were struggling to remember what they had to say as they were talking.     Otherwise... the movie was actually really good and I credit the director, John Stockwell, who is also known for acting stints in Top Gun, Christine & My Science Project. FOR ONCE!! A DIRECTOR TREATED US LIKE WE ARE INTELLIGENT BEINGS AND DIDN'T CHEAT US! No, movies most important job isn't to inform, but they are supposed to be realistic. After watching INTO THE BLUE, I had a better understanding of the DIVE trade and it was completely necessary to move the movie along.     Stockwell did his homework. He cared about the audience and cared that they know what was going on. He didn't preach or bog the story down with diving lessons, he made diving and what they had to do part of the story.     Stockwell shot a beautiful movie with wonderful underwater scenes that are engrossing and sharp. Not to mention, necessary story movers.     Not only did he deliver the goods with the diving scenes, he delivered with a sharp story about modern day ocean pirates, club life, drug life and WHAT TRULY MAKES A person successful? Is it money? or is it Love?     You know what. I hope Hollywood stops giving these great idea movies to the Emmerichs and Bays of the worlds and starts giving more of these movies to people like Stockwell. Directors that don't insult our intelligence, do their homework and understand that movies have to be more than just an explosion here and there. It has to be sensible. Fine job and I'm looking forward to owning this one on DVD.
B000059XUO|5.0|Hollywood often bores me.  But The Crow was a brilliant combination of Death Wish, Ghost and the Dark Knight.  It has a rather standard, staid theme of revenge, but adds to it such odd imagery - a ghoul hero with a Death symbol for a pet and poetry from Edgar Allen Poe.  This all gives the film a rich depth and body, like a robust wine, which surprisingly for all the dark imagery, goes down rather smoothly.  The reason the deeply shadowed film feels so good is because of its counterpoint meta message - the power of love.  This note is admittedly a chic-flick theme, but with all the explosions and fight scenes and a walking corpse, this is hardly Sleepless in Seattle.<br />Brandon Lee gives a powerful performance and it is truly unfortunate we won't see more of him, because his very natural style on this screen hints to more amazing skill that could have been his future.  It's also exciting that he was willing to take on such an \\"alternative\\" film.<br />The music score was marvelous, but admittedly, I also love Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, early Queensryche and other metal rockers.  So if you don't like metal, the music might not connect.  The music connected clearly with the dark image of random gangs of rouges that rape, pillage and plunder for pure entertainment - a hint of A Clockwork Orange in that regard.<br />The film has a bit of the Hollywood standard T&A, but no gratuitous sex scenes.  It has explosions purely for the sake of excitement, but the other elements of image and shadow, philosophical themes of humanity and eternal love, powerful music and hard-hitting, well timed poetry.  As a result, the standard tools of sex, violence and \\"rock and roll\\" can be forgiven.  The Crow is truly a work of art, not just a flick.  Nicely done.

0321525655|5.0|Have you ever read a book where the content is so appealing, applicable, and soothing that you wish it would never end?    \\"Presentation Zen\\" is one of those books. This book is filled from cover to cover with amazing examples, techniques, and images that inspire and encourage excellence in presentation. The layout adheres to the principles of simplicity and elegance taught in the book. The author, Garr Reynolds, is generous and knowledgeable in his narrative.    The book consists of five sections:    Introduction - This section starts with one of my favorite quotes: \\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\\" (Leonardo Da Vinci). This sets the tone for the rest of the book.    Preparation - Get away from the computer and think about the central point. My favorite suggestion from this section is: \\"As you prepare a presentation, exercise restraint and keep these three words in mind always: simplicity, clarity, brevity.\\"    Design -  Here the author reminds us of the design principles often associated with Zen: Simplicity, Naturalness, and Elegance. You can't really go wrong if you keep these in mind.    Delivery - Having an awesome deck of slides is all well and good, but the delivery of the presentation is just as important. The key here is being completely present and in tune with your audience.    Next Steps - Practice makes perfect!    The best part of this book is that the author does not hold back on sharing the wealth. After reading some books, I feel like \\"yeah, that sounds good in theory, but it didn't give me the tools I need to make it happen.\\" \\"Presentation Zen\\" provides all the tools you need, including confidence. In fact, it even includes a promotional offer for iStockPhoto to get you started with getting high quality images for your next presentation. After reading this book, I totally get Seth Godin's tongue-in-cheek comment in his endorsement:    \\"Please don't buy this book! Once people start making better presentations, mine won't look so good.\\"I am actually excited about starting on my next presentation for an upcoming product roadshow. I can't wait to deliver an amazing presentation!
B00026WU9Q|5.0|From the blurry hazy cover photo of the young Dylan and Suze Rotolo this album shows the influences of chemically expanded consciousness and classic blues.  The song titles alone show the incredible imagination of Bob Dylan at his creative best. \\"Subterranian Homesick Blues\\" features Bob flexing his lyrical command and with the rhyming political commentary.  \\"She Belongs To Me\\" is a tender ballad, yet another song that makes no reference of the title in the words. \\"Maggie's Farm\\" is great ranting song with a cutting harmonica that the band plays like their lives depend upon it. \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" is a love song with unbelievable metaphoric references throughout.  Dylan sings, \\"My love she speaks like silence\\" in a song that again shows Bob's command of paradoxical word play.  \\"Outlaw Blues\\" and \\"On the Road Again\\" are good tunes. \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" is a joyous romp where Dylan breaks up in laughter and has to start the song over.  The story told reflects a newer version of Captain Ahab, and describes some of the folks he and Bob encounter in Dylan's dream.  \\"Mr Tambourine Man\\" is the often covered standard which was one of the great hits off the disk.  The record takes a darker turn with \\"Gates of Eden\\", \\"It's All Right, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding), and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\", which were frequently covered by different artists throughout the 60s and 70s.  In all, a wonderful release that captures one of the best songwriters at his height of creativity.  A must have!
B000003CMD|4.0|The Allman Brothers had just lost their guitar virtuoso and co-founder Duane Allman, and were soon to lose their bass player, Berry Oakley, who only contributes two songs to this release.  The resulting music features strong singing and songwriting by Dicky Betts, as well as rolling keyboards by Chuck Leavelle, who had last played with the band on \\"Live From the Filmore\\" release.  \\"Wasted Words\\" showcases Betts on slide guitar. The single, \\"Rambling Man\\" is still a Betts standard, with guitar leads contributed by Les Dudek.  \\"Come And Go Blues\\" is a classic Allman's take on the blues.  \\"Southbound\\" a tale of returning home for these Southern rockers, has great guitar and tight drumming.  \\"Jessica\\" is an instrumental standard, and the often overlooked \\"Pony Boy\\" is lead by Betts's slide and dobro playing.  This is not as powerful as some of the earlier Allman Brothers releases, but is still worth owning.
B001CD6FKS|3.0|Ok, this is probably one of the most amazing technical movies I've ever seen - very well acted, especially by Susan Sarandon as Mom Racer, who was just amazing in this, but - Speed Racer??    My 2 cents.    If you're really really into speed racer the cartoon, you must have this.    if you really liked the middle and last matrix movie, you'll probably like this. probably not enough to make it worth buying tho :(.    If you're into the technical feats of making cutting edge movies, get this and watch the extra stuff.    Beyond that? um - yeah, rent it maybe? (which is what I did).    Still and all - it's a really mazing movie, technically - just amazing feats of digital movie making, and it's several steps beyond bullettime from the first matrix movie :). (I KNOW Kung FU! ;) )
B001PPLIEG|4.0|Daniel Craig once again proves himself as a masterful Bond.  Not quite as good as the first one, but well worth viewing again and again.
B000002I4S|5.0|This album is a landmark jazz recording.  It contains arguably the finest tenor saxophone solo in the tune \\"Giant Steps.\\" Two versions are presented: the blistering first track that makes most amateur saxophone players feel inferior and is endlessly studied by jazz saxophone students at music schools, and a more laid-back version.<br /><br />The remainder of the album showcases Coltrane's playing before he veered into more esoteric areas.  There is much here for the jazz fan, and any saxophone player should hear this as an example of what the instrument can do.<br /><br />If you are new to John Coltrane's music, start here.  It is a very good album on which to hear him in his prime.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|It will take more time than you think because after watching these you will have to go out and buy the whole series of books. Probably better for you than sitting in fornt of the TV for so long anyways. Addictive is right.  Now I can't decide whther John Grisham or Charlaine Harris is my favorite author. Tough call.
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|Let me get this off my hairy neanderthal chest: Comic books were written for wee geeks in private schools who fantasized about having special powers as their own puny selves could never make on the football/rugger field. They mimic the way these poor souls try to get a woman into bed - hey I may not look much but really I'm Spiderman/supersmartnerdboy.      There is only one half-decent comic book movie and that's Batman with Big Jack, plus Basinger when she was still hot (\\"stop the press, who is that!\\").     The best thing about this movie is the bank heist of the first ten minutes. And then - boom nothing more. It moves on in its over serious noisy way into nothingness. Ledger here is a one-trick pony, Eckhart's been much better in other movies and the whole thing is.....boring. A big yawn. It doesn't help if you stack your movie with terrible actors like Caine, Oldman and Freeman. Rented it and couldn't even finish it over two nights. An hour in I was thinking - why is everyone taking this so seriously? Where is the fun? The glory of Jack in the first Batman is that he is fun, and almost believable- playful.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|Worth viewing both seasons to watch the growth of the primary cast. The roles sustain their depth in the 2nd season as the two heroes of the show examine their own flaws. Just enough \\"cliff notes fact\\" to float the outrageous circumstances the writers weave. I applaude the creators for avoiding the \\"emperor-by-episode\\" style of I,CLAUDIUS (still the high watermark for Roman History to TV Drama) ROME should have a long life on HBO. All Hail!
B001EN71CW|5.0|This isn't a Firefly review, it's a review of the blu-ray release, with me wandering off subject now and then. Firefly is a 5 star show canceled before it's time. One of my favorite television series of all time. The purpose of this review is to let fans of the show know if the blu-ray release is worth picking up or not.    I was lucky enough to catch Firefly when it debuted on television. It was just after a cross-country move from Florida to Colorado. I rushed to get cable hooked up in my new apartment so I could watch the first episode on its broadcast premiere. As the first commercial break began, I realized I was hooked, not since 'Babylon 5' had I felt so enthralled by a television show. Sadly, we all know my enjoyment was short with only 11 of 14 episode airing before cancellation, not to mention Fox doing it's regular thing of interfering and having the broadcast order changed. Anyway, it's a sad tale, but it's well in the past now. I must admit to owning 3 versions of Serenity including the Blu-ray.    Before I get into the Blu, I'm going to give you a brief rundown of the theater system I use in my bedroom, where I am watching this blu-ray set. My television is a Sharp Aquos LC42D85U 42-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV. Blu-ray player is a Hewlett Packard HDX 18t running Cyberlink PowerDVD9(phenomenal fully high definition laptop). The center of my sound system is a Onkyo TX-SR706 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver, sporting a Klipsch Quintet SL Home Theater System, and a Klipsch Synergy SUB-10 Subwoofer for deep rumbling bass. I have a decent system, excellent picture and sound.    Firefly Complete Series [Blu-ray]  The series is packaged in a single case, only consisting of three discs, so if you're at the store looking for a box set like I was, you'll be looking for a while. It looks like a single disc release, yet there are three blu discs inside as well as a small fold out episode listing. I didnt say episode guide, since it is'nt, its just a listing.    I'vewatched the sd-DVD release I own more than I care to admit. I honestly love this show; from the characters, to the ideas presented, and the CG. My first impression once I began watching the blu was just how clean, vivid, and crisp the picture was. This is a huge upgrade in picture quality over the standard definition DVDs. Those once forbidden, dark spaces which light seemed to not be able to penetrate, and which caused you to turn off every light source for 3 rooms, have been transformed. NOw there is a luxurious depth and texture to those dark spaces. No longer just black, now they are living shadow, now they breath as you watch, and ebb with the soundtrack. the overall picture is much brighter, much more vivid and rich of color. I saw much more than I ever have, and as I stated above, a bit more than I care to admit. Now I wouldnt be honest with you if I said the picture was flawless. There are artifacts in oblique areas of CG, and some occasional graininess during certain sequences. I'm not talking about the induced artifacts, or blurs that Whedon likes to employ. I'm just talking about some minor imperfections that no fan will mind, and only the sharpest eye will lock onto. Any scene with a CG 'Full Burn' is worth the price of admission.    Now as good as the high def transfer is on this blu-ray release, the audio is what really shines when comparing the two releases. The DTS-HD Master 5.1 Audio track is phenomenal, earth-shattering on my a/v system; two big thumbs up! A huge upgrade over the original releases Dolby Surround soundtrack. Jaynestown was really, and I mean really fun with this new audio. Honestly, I heard things I had'nt heard before. Not so much dialogue, more inflection. I came to several new conclusions about what I thought before. The action sequences are really fun as well, the audio really comes alive, bringing you right into the action, all that is missing from the experience is smell-o-vision.    The bottum line for this fan:  For me, this is a huge upgrade over the original DVD release. The picture quality is vastly improved, and the audio is on a whole new level. If you're a fan like me, you can not go wrong by adding this release to your library, especially if you have a good home theater system. Considering what I've seen from other releases in blu recently, and the knowledge this show wasnt shot for HD, I'm impressed with what they have accomplished in this transfer. I hope this sad excuse for a review has helped those who read it.     'Tell you what. You buy this ship - treat her proper - she'll be with you for the rest of your life.'
B0001I562I|5.0|Fantastic film in 1986 and just as awesome in 2009.  One of the best Disney live action films.
0007284764|4.0|A fine book for dog lovers but especially for those who have lost a loved canine. I would translate the New Age perspective to a Christian viewpoint with verses such as \\"His eye is on the sparrow.\\" Indicating that there may be an afterlife for dogs, Genesis 9  states that even animals will be called to account. Also, see theologian C.S. Lewis' perspective on the matter. I sent this book as a birthday gift to my brother who misses his dog Enzo, the name of the protagonist in this story.
0375842209|5.0|This book must be read by everyone. It is a little hard getting into and had I not had to read for book club I wouldn't have. BUT!!!! Once you are grabbed, it is an awesome book. The characters are well developed and the message is something that must be gotten out. The writing is creative and imaginative as well as realistic. The author captures the nature of each person with much insight and sensitivity. Really, if you don't own it yet GO PURCHASE IT AND GET STARTED NOW!!!!!!
B0017XCDN6|5.0|my hero, now a director, does it again!  Showing the Japanese soldiers as human beings is a reminder of how inhuman their government was/is.
0440238609|5.0|I have read this trilogy at least five times. Each time I find new pieces of the story that I did not notice the first time. An instant classic, these books are an amazing feat of literature. Pullman is a genius.
B0006JGFNQ|4.0|This singing Gizmo, while being very limited in what it can sing, er I mean hum, if fun. My daughters enjoy this toy a lot. Not bad for the price.
B000WM725C|4.0|While this is the same show used for Live Rust, the sound is cleaner and there is an extra track.  The only complaint is that the pictures Amazon shows indicate that this is the album with Pearl Jam, when it isn't.  Its Crazy Horse that backs NY on this one.  It is an import too.
B001P5Q6FC|4.0|I applaud Randy for trying a slightly different vocal approach on \\"In Your Words\\" and the transition from the first instrumental track \\"The Passing\\" into \\"In Your Words\\" is perfect... a great way to open a CD.  Some songs, like \\"Contractor\\" definitely pick up the tempo from the average LOG track.  I tend to like the slower, sludgy stuff, but it's a nice change of pace.  I don't disagree that it's easy to criticize LOG in many areas of their music, but it's always a fun listen and Wrath definitely doesn't disappoint.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|An absolute must for any home theater collection or certainly for any James Bond collection.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|My only complaint is that the CD is little too short, overall.  I think one more track would have made it the perfect length.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|Item being reviewed        Pinocchio (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition + Standard DVD+ BD Live) [Blu-ray]    Great product and beautiful enhanced version of a Disney classic.  DH
B00007E7K0|5.0|This purchase was just a Canon 58mm lens cap. It works fine and as usual, Amazon has been easy to deal with.
0671646788|2.0|If I would have realized this book was originally published in 1959 I would not have purchased it. The information is so outdated to make it laughable. There is nothing new in here that hasn't been said much more deeply than other contemporary authors. It has a sexist leaning, which I was able to overcome, but the simplistic advice was very disappointing. It offered nothing new and only touched the surface of the concepts it did introduce. I can do nothing with the information in this book. Not sure I will finish, which is very unusual for me.
B001OTXM10|5.0|Some people on here don't know what they're talking about. They said this band sounded like \\"a poor man's version of Flaw.\\" Dude, what are you talking about. Yeah, Flaw is/was an awesome band, but 5fdp my friend, is nothing like them. I mean, they're two totally different kinds of rock. Flaw is more alternative, and the lyrics in their songs are meant to inspire people and lift them up. 5fdp obviously isn't going for that, they have angry lyrics. They are heavy metal, and in no way, shape or form does Ivan Moody sound like Chris Volz and is not trying to. That is retarded, and the worst band to band comparison i've ever heard. That's ridiculous. These two bands are nothing alike. Thats like saying Nickelback sounds like Alice in Chains. Well as for the review, this album is not perfect, it brings nothing new to the table of metal, but it damn sure bangs your head. These guys take all the elements of heavy metal that you love and put em together.Good job guys!
B001H5X7I4|3.0|This movie was just OK.  It had some hilarious scenes, but most of it was mildly humorous.  I was disappointed after all the hype and the trailers run in the commercials. I expected a lot more from a combination of Ben Stiller and Jack Black.  Robert Downey, Jr. was terrific; He should have won the Oscar.  His performance was absolutely inspired even if politically incorrect.
B000021Y7X|2.0|Most of the reviews have been raves.  I usually rate tunes by my impression the first time I listen to them or to a new arrangment.  Not being a huge Talking Heads fan, I found many of the songs uneventful, and the stage effects a bit distracting.  Some of the lighting effects seemed like updated versions of 60s psychedelic for the kids who weren't old enough to have seen it.  I'm an old musician, so I like to see the musicians more than the staging.  The entire show seemed to be just a showcase for David Byrne to putz around on stage.  I was especially disappointed by the arrangement of \\"Take Me To The River\\".  I really liked the tempo of the original version - it had a grindingly soulful sound to it.  Speeding it up by about 30% was a mistake, and the tune lost the thing that made it what it originally was.    I recently heard that one of our local PBS stations is going to air this concert DVD during a fundraiser.  I wish I'd waited to hear it there first - I wouldn't have bought a copy.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Switching places with a Jane Austen character is something that should be done more often, if done this well! It was so fun to watch and I really did not want it to end. The twists and turns to the original story are refreshing and entertaining. This was a fun watch and highly recommended from one Austen fan to others.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|The production is simple (so I'll keep the review simple as well) and the songs are great. You have to give credit to any artist that doesn't keep cranking out the same album over and over again. If you like it, I recommend this album as well:    [[ASIN:B001Y0O2PO Vertical Hold]]    It's simple, slightly quirky and catchy.
0321544080|5.0|This book was a gift and the person who received it, just loved it! perfectly new and it arrived to italy so quick!<br />thanx!
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|What can be said about Mr. Cohen that hasn't already? His delivery might not be everyones cup of tea, but his songwriting prowess is irrefutable! If you enjoy the well crafted song, then buy it!     I'd also recommend Blimp:  [[ASIN:B001Y0O2PO Vertical Hold]]    Simple, quirky little tunes, but well crafted!
B001ILFUDC|4.0|This is another movie that I ordered for the same relative.  They don't own a computer, so they aren't able to order those good movies that you can't find in a video, or department store.  I'm sure they are enjoying this movie.  They would have let me known if there was a problem.
0596007124|2.0|This book is a bit of a mixed bag; there are some good examples in it and it is easy to understand, but you do have to wade through a huge amount of rubbish to find the useful information. I'd say that about 80% of this book is filler and you can skip it, the problem with that of course is that you get into the habit of skipping so much that you might end up missing the few things of value. The exercises are very very basic, so if you have been programming for any length of time you will find them quite insulting. Actually I found most of the book quite insulting.    It is very java centric, so they make quite a lot of reference to the java api, but if you know another OO language well this isn't really a problem. For all my griping I would say that it is worth a look if you don't know anything about design patterns because pretty quickly you will get the idea that most of \\"design patterns\\" is about stating the obvious.
B001EXE2ZG|3.0|This film is a legend of a kind?<br />Certainly not a film you would take your children to?<br />Hollywood makes and breaks millions of people every generation.<br />Many after they have been successful ...<br />That, then, with no shame they would make a movie<br />(actually several of this kind I have seen, one recently about an old homosexual British film director)<br />about how things can go very very wrong<br />with their star system, shows that there is very little sense or heart in the film business.<br />That such a film should be acclaimed as a great film, is about as mad as the lady the film is about?
0765350386|4.0|I had every intention of giving this three stars but it really came through at the end.  I get really tired of authors who think that b/c their novel is written in a mideval fantasy time women aren't important besides as the cook or washer girl or whore.  Oh I'm sorry none are important unless they are abnormally superhuman.  Then they can be written about and be part of the story.  It shows a HUGE hole in the author's experience.  I am so hoping this improves in the next two books.  That said I will be reading the next one.  Cautiously...
B000ZN802W|5.0|I loved this movie!!!!  Ever since i seen it, now I want to go into the wild!  forget about all the cities, i want to go camping and travel because of this movie! it changed my life!
B000RZOR2U|5.0|The sacred music of Bach occupies the very pinnacle of Western Civilization. I began listening to these cantatas in the early '70s, at the beginning of the 'original instrument' movement. There are still 20 or so of these beautifully boxed LPs in my closet, though I have retrieved the scores. I applaud Warner Classics for making these recordings available on CD for less then $250, surely the best bargain on the planet. The quality of the sound is astounding. The treble voices are just right for this music, and are much preferred to the sopranos being employed in other Bach cantata projects. I miss having the scores that were provided with the LPs, but that is a tiny concern. Strongly recommend.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I got this cd because I didn't have a itunes account and basically wanted one song...gotta be somebody for me out there(by new bsf..best song forever!). But was wonderfully surprised that I like alot of songs on here!..
B001F290E4|5.0|I am very pleased with this item. Received it in a very short period of time, and in good condition. Thank you.
B0002XV30Q|5.0|This two-disc EMI Classics recording includes all of Camille Saint-Saëns' numbered Piano Concertos (1-5), and also includes his shorter \\"Wedding Cake\\" and \\"Africa\\" piano concertos.  I've been enjoying this two-disc set immensely, and the recording quality is excellent.  Even though the piano concertos do not follow each other in sequential order (Nos. 1, 2 and 4 are on Disc 1 & Nos. 3, 5 and the rest are on Disc 2), they do make sense.    There are other complete Saint-Saëns piano concertos sets on the market, but I think that for a price of less than $12 - you will be hard pressed to find any recording that gives you more bang for your buck.  Enjoy!
B001V9LRTM|4.0|There's a variety of completists out there which are astute music lovers and definitive fans of the era which love everything Woodstock and all 60's era media material, such as music, books and other viable formats. Despite the aforementioned re-recording mixing involved, what additional footage are some of the Woodstock community aware of, of perhaps some of the original filmers that were actually there? There a chance we could hear some of the input in this matter?  Realize this could've been mentioned in the Product Details or Editorial Reviews listed by Amazon, but is there someone in the know that can shed light on this?    One of the items I found interesting in seeing the Ultimate Edition trailer is that now we're back to the 4-hr cut -  which theoretically would include fifteen more minutes of either performances and/or interviews (the additional Joe Cocker we're seeing in the video preview?), with an additional disc of two hours more of performances and on the Amazon bonus disc, three more performances from Grateful Dead!!, Jeff Airplane & Country Joe. Had noticed throughout some of the websites of the Woodstock Community that nowhere is there mentioned that Santana played Evil Ways, yet we see it as a potential live number played at Woodstock. Wow, man, what gives??     Interested in hearing more?  Please let us know for those involved in the project, as this completist definitely's aching for more and more...
0316017922|3.0|Gladwell gets us to think and that, in itself, is worth the price of admission. It really is time for us to explore the essence of that mysterious term \\"success\\". Like a beautiful black butterfly success is alluring, intriguing, and hard to capture. Does making lots of money constitute success? Is being the President of the United States the key to success?<br /><br />I agree with Gladwell that culture, circumstances, timing, birth order, and luck are all part of the stew of success. However, there is more, much more. We are complex, multi-layered beings who come from long lines of complex, multi-layered beings. Who we are comes from the original organization we all joined, the family. It is here we learned about justice, creativity, favoritism, conflict, and love. We take what we learn and add an overlay from the culture and the times into which we were born.Then we sprinkle it with personal, community or world crises and voila, a real human being takes shape and makes decisions about what really matters and what constitutes success.<br /><br />What Gladwell leaves out, and why I was disappointed with the substance of the book is a depth discussion about the loyalties and legacies that can put a stop or a go on our \\"successes\\". Once we can begin to explore the patterns from our past, the family as well as the cultural legacies, traditions , and attitudes we inherit from our ancestors we can gain a clearer understanding of why there is so much power to repeat rather than stand on the shoulders of the past. This goes so far past I.Q. of any number, so far past the month of birth, so far past good or mediocre schooling, and these deeper legacies and loyalties require a more thoughtful account than this book offers.<br /><br />At least the dialogue has begun and for that, \\"good job, Gladwell.\\"<br /><br />Sylvia Lafair PhD author \\"Dont Bring It to Work: Breaking the Family Patterns that Limit Success\\".

B001CTDH4Y|5.0|What a great little movie!We bought it and reviewed it for our grandchildren and enjoyed it so much we are watching it again before they even see it.  It has humor, romance and the cutest story.  We are in our late 50's and this just made us feel young.  Highly recommended for all!!
0780626966|3.0|I thought it was a great deal ,however when I recieved it , freddys dead was not in it ,it has two of the same bonus disks instead, and for me to buy the missing one will be almost the price of the whole set...      With that aside the disks that were in it all play very well and I recieved them very fast..... Thanks !!
B0018J48QO|5.0|Dexter is great.  Can wait to see more.  Season 1 & 2 were terrific.  Going to watch Season 3 right away.
B000002NG7|3.0|3 1/2    Their last was marginally weakest of the Patton releases; dotted with potency but overall cynically simplistic and half-hearted. Goes to show that with even such shaky melodic foundations, talented groups make it work. Let's hope the reunion can spark another valuable release and give modern mainstream rock the kick in the pants it needs.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|In some ways, this film is a unique cultural product, that demonstrates the tension between historic fact and imaginative embellishment; between the craft of fine acting and pornography; and between the contrasting philosophies of the artists responsible for this collage of intentions. This review will look at all three of these contrasts.    Many of the events in this film come down to us as part of the historic record. The rise and fall of these characters was documented by historians of the time and in following generations. However, in this production the events are embellished to the extreme so that the film becomes nightmarish or surreal. The costumes are akin to the flimsy costumes worn by strippers. The lives of Tiberius and Caligula and Claudius offer incredible drama and decadence as related in Suetonius' Live of the Caesars and in Robert Graves' I, Claudius.  Yet we know enough of Roman culture and daily life to understand that these characters were aberrations and products of madness and absolute power. The average Roman did not act this way and were scandalized by the behaviors of Tiberius and Caligula.  The beautiful young lovers, Livia and Proculus, exemplify this in the film. The terrible deeds that are inflicted on this handsome and innocent couple are a critical aspect of the film for they demonstrate the violation of commonly-held moral behaviors by those in absolute power who also are mentally deranged. This is a critical point in understanding this film. The absolute power of the Julio-Claudians family, of which Tiberius and Caligula were emperors 3 and 4, surrounds itself with immoral fortune seekers and parasites, that reflect back to the source of power a sense that their cruelty is indeed just fun and games, that their abuse of power is justified because of the baseness of human nature and that the people they rule are scum.  An important scene in the film depicts Caligula forcing the entire Senate to make sheep sounds while he gleefully laughs at the ability of his absolute power to create absurd behaviors in others.    The second theme that any reviewer must address is the contrast between actors with top tier reputations combining their art with that of pornographers. John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole, and Helen Mirren are highly respected and are the three strongest actors in this production. It is actually hard to judge the acting of Malcolm McDowell as Caligula since the character is so wildly overstated and dominant. McDowell plays Caligula as highly intelligent, highly indulged, and sadistically deranged. Again we are less concerned with his violent outbursts against the self serving court favorites as we are about his treatment of the lovers, Livia and Proculus, the moral center of the production. As an example, handsome and ruthless and cunning Macro is outsmarted by Caligula and comes to a terrible end, but the viewer could care less because we have learned that Macro is corrupted and power seeking. However the violation of Livia and Proculus on their wedding night and then the subsequent violence against Proculus is horrifying. As they torture Proculus he screams asking why such pain is being inflicted on him since he is a loyal lower rank military officer. Caligula answers that it is because he is not guilty that he is guilty. It is because he is not corrupt that he must be destroyed. Absolute power in combination with sadism is the recipe for human evil. But beyond Caligula, we must remember that power over others in combination with inability to experience empathy with the other is one strong source of the evil we may all experience in everyday life.     This last point brings up the contrasting and conflicting visions of Gore Vidal and Bob Guccione, the owner of Penthouse and the producer of the film.  If you are familiar with the excellent novels and essays of Gore Vidal, you soon learn of his contention that when Republics become Empires they lose their moral footing and begin to inflict cruelty and oppression against those they conquer and begin to stimulate decadence in the lives of the privileged individuals who have risen in the social class structure of the Empire.  Thus the decadence of Tiberius and Caligula and the suicide of Nerva all help convey his message that Empire and power corrupts.  But Bob Guccione has a philosophy against censorship and sexual oppression, and therefore he inserted many pornographic sequences into the film in the final edits, as if to thumb his nose at the moral sensibilities of those that run our current Empire. At first glance it would appear to be that Vidal and Guccione would be allies in their assault against the Empire. Vidal would accost the Empire for turning from its Republican roots and suppressing other nations for the aggrandizement of the Empire. Guccione would accost the Empire for sexual hypocrisy and lack of sexual freedoms. However it is the manner in which they accost the Empire that differs, and style and taste matter. For Vidal wishes us to draw upon our intellectual history and challenge the Empire on historic and rational grounds founded in the Enlightenment whereas Guccione wishes to challenge the Empire with sexual truths that often stay inside the bedroom but become unnerving when viewed in the light of day or on the motion picture screen.    This film is definitely a unique viewing experience.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Note: This review is regarding the \\"Director's Cut\\" version of the film.    Very good movie. Excellent music composition. This movie truly brought out the essence of what a true knight/warrior should be. Definitely worth watching.
0394818237|5.0|Great book. So well illustrated. Very cute and funny.    I remember this book from when I was young. As an inquisitive child it was an all-time favourite, nurturing those many \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" questions of a fascinated little boy!
1400064287|5.0|Duct tape won't work.  I'm sure this simple idea is an unexpected beginning for a book.  Duct tape is concrete, but so is this book by Heath and Heath.  Duct tape won't work to make our ideas stick, but the ideas in this book will work, whether you want them to stick in your own mind or in the minds of those who hear or read you.<br />One reason the book will do its job is that it is credible. As you read these six simple ideas, you will find it easy to believe that they will indeed make your ideas stick.<br /><br />I'm writing this review because I am working on a book myself, a book about an idea, an idea that can make anyone into a good thinker.  I want the simple idea that I present to remembered for the rest of the reader's life, therefore I bought a copy of Made to Stick and continually test my writing by Heath and Heath's six criteria.<br /><br />I've become excited about the potential success of my book.  I get emotional as I am writing it. Now, in a few words, I have told the story of the book and my reason for the review.  The book is a SUCCES(s) because the way to make our ideas stick is to make them: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, and tell a Story-these are the six elements of sticky ideas.

0316010669|4.0|I've avoided reading Mr Gladwell before due to various silly reasons - which mostly boil down to me avoid pop science books that talk about the values in gut reaction. However, I've been reading a lot on general marketing, management and brain development of late and I was looking for something related and light. \\"Blink\\" perfectly fit the bill.<br /><br />At heart, this is a book of stories. Within this framework, Mr Gladwell makes some compelling arguments about trusting the unconscious brain's initial read. Further, that when many factors are in play, sometimes it really does make sense to listen to the initial reaction instead of digging deeper into the problem. What makes this compelling is simple - he puts limits on when this works and describes situations where it fails. In fact he goes even farther and talks about how training is needed to fully know that you can trust your instincts. And to know when you can trust them. Indeed when we don't have training he shows how easy it is to \\"seed\\" someone so that they are more or less likely to reach certain conclusions (see Kahneman). A similar line of thought is used by Mr Taleb in \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" so its very good to see books come together on topics.<br /><br />For all this, there isn't much depth here so don't come looking for that. Instead focus on enjoying the ride as Mr Gladwell is a first class story teller.

0380713802|5.0|Since being introduced to \\"In A Sunburned Country\\", I have been a big Bill Bryson fan. Although seen as a travel book, it truly isn't in the strictest sense. Bryson wanted to revisit many of the places that he had as a much younger man, and see it through more worldly eyes (and with a fatter wallet, perhaps). He describes his experiences, often going back and forth from the first trip to the second, in hilarious detail. I laughed out loud through almost every chapter.    Yes, he is quick to point out what he doesn't like about various locations. However, even when he's completely charmed by a city, as he is in Rome, he still describes the insanity of the Roman's driving and parking habits in a refreshingly truthful and very funny way.     Obviously, there are people who found his candor distasteful, but I thought this was one of his best books.
B001QTMRXM|4.0|This is not a review of Delains - April Rain.  Its what a fan of Delain thinks of Their new album. Hope you guys don't get judgmental by reading any of these review, if you like Delain like i do, then go get the album, coz its a beautiful piece of art with a great assortment of songs.    i was one of the first lucky ones to get the brand new album when it came out. I loved lucidity... though it had some over dose of guest musicians, then real soul of Delain according to me was a bit in the background.    that's the best part in this album. this album is the real Delain.   one of the best thing s int he album is Charlotte Wessels's voice...  its a great leap from the first album. its very evident in many of the songs where she does some great modulations, and its very nice to hear.  the sound is very much like the earlier album, but i find this album having more varied songs than the previous one.    When i first heard April rain, the thing that hit me first was her voice. its much more improved than the previous album. the songs great, its sounds powerful, and the tune stays in you mind! great video, and its a great song for a title track.  Stay forever has a very within temptationish sound, which is great. its a lovely fast song, with some great double bass and the song sounds like a nice power ballad.   Invidia is a nice song, one of the ok songs according me. its sounds very familiar, still its nice!  Control the storm is one of the best songs in the whole album. Marco does a brilliant job of providing his vocals for the song. the whole structure is very different and its very addictive. i hope they make a video for this song.   On the other side, its a lovely song. i love the violin/cello in the background. it adds a very gloomy feel to the song. it has a beautiful guitar solo bridge towards the end.   Virtue and Vice is a nice song, to a fan, its a typical Delain song, with the added growls and the violin/cello sounds great.  Go away, sounds like a song from the previous album. its heavy, its got some great symphonic elements. A good song for to lead to the next song which is one of Delains best.  Start Swimming is a beautiful song. her voice is angelic... its a great ballad sounding song, and its the song that iv heard the most in the album. the slow pace makes this sound absolutely great.  Lost is an good song, and very Delain sounding, more on the lines of frozen.  Il reach you is a great song for the end... great vocals, its heavy and melodic and has a nice gloomy feel... lovely song.  Nothing left is another very Delain sounding song, with Marcos voice, its sounds great... nothing very different.    To all the delain fans, please go buy the album. the review should give you an idea of the album, hope it doesn't influence you from not buying it. Its a great album for easy listening, so go get it!

0307454894|5.0|If you watch the movie without reading the book you may come out with a misconception that this is not much more than a reverse Lolita. However, I read it before watching the movie. It felt like reading DH Lawrence's [[ASIN:0375753737 Sons and Lovers (Modern Library Classics)]]  and Tolstoy's [[ASIN:0140441840 Resurrection (Penguin Classics)]] together. One of my many favorite passages is on page 70, without giving away the story:\\"I read her War and Peace with all of Tolstoy's disquisitions on history, great men, Russia,love and marriage;... she withheld her own opinions; she did not make Natasha, Andrei, Pierre part of her world ... but entered their world the way one sets out on a long and dazzling journey, or enters a castle which one is allowed to visit, .....    We too are better off withholding our own 21st century opinions of Hanna and Michael as we take the journey together reading their story spanning 51 years, from 1944 to 1995.    I am still recovering from reading The Reader. Wish Bernhard Schlink made Michael and Hanna read DH Lawrence's Man who died\\" [[ASIN:1406571601 The Man Who Died (Dodo Press)]]also in addition to Chekhov, Kafka, Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig, Keller, Goethe, Lenz, Odyssey and War and Peace. If you liked reading Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress [[ASIN:0385722206 Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress: A Novel]] by Dai Sijie, you may also relate better to this kind of story.  This indeed is a book lover's book, pun intended.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|This is a celebration of 30+ years of David Foster's career.  I didn't know he wrote or produced so many great songs especially  during 80's & 90's.    As a Blu-ray Disc, I'd rate Video Quality 4.5 Star and Audio 5 Star.  As stated this show won't be complete without proper 5.1 surround  sound system. The sound with DTS Master Audio 5.1 was just fabulous!  It really gave a good workout for my home theater system.    There are several big name artists such as Andrea Bocelli,Peter Cetera,  Brian Mcknight,Josh Groban etc..however there are some surprises too.  Young singer Charice from Philipines was fantastic!    This concert is enjoyable for almost everyone especially if you like pop  music from 80's and 90's. It's definitely recommended for music lovers.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|At least every review here must talk about the sexual content in this film.  Well, the nudity  surprised me at first, but the scenes were only in the beginning of the movie and they disappeared pretty quick.  The content of these scenes was strong enough that the actor playing young Michael Berg had to wait to turn 18 to film the scenes. If you watch the movie, you will see he is a very good actor.     The Reader is about the love affair between 15 year-old Michael and a woman twice his age, Hanna.  The affair lasts the summer until Hanna suddenly disappears.  The next time Michael is to see her he is a law student and Hanna is on trial for her involvement in the Holocaust.  With Hanna refusing to defend herself properly, Michael figures out her secret and then is torn between telling the judge what Hanna is obviously ashamed about or keeping it to himself, which will mean hurting Hanna in the trial.    The content in this movie is powerful.  The movie does a lot with a little- there is little action, the music is slow and subtle, (but beautiful) and the story itself unravels slowly.  Kate Winslet's acting is at it's best.  After watching the movie I couldn't stop thinking about it and went back to see it again.  I like that this movie made me question myself; when I found myself feeling sorry for Hanna I asked myself, Was I really feeling sorry for someone who was a Nazi? The movie almost portrays Hanna as a victim and it is up to you to determine your feelings about her.  There is also a very powerful scene at the end of the movie in which the older Michael Berg goes to visit one of the victims who survived the Holocaust.  I don't think there are many movies these days that leave people thinking and asking questions in the end, so this is a must see film.  You won't forget it.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|A lot has been said about this movie, some good points but a lot not so good.  Australia is a movie that would not necessarily get good critical reviews, however as an Australian myself I found it to be very entertaining, quite funny in parts and even I learned a lot about my country's history.  There is no doubt that the film covers it's own Cultural landscape very well, and the characters show the futility of the stolen generation plan with dignity and compassion.  The actors are wonderful although the role played by Nicole Kidman seemed a little over the top with her English accent, but Hugh Jackman was supurb as \\"Drover'.  A little long but the time went quite quickly for me.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|It's prettymuch what I thought it would be.  It's head  and body moves (I wouldn't call it dancing) and he sings that sweet Gizmo song.
B000LC55F2|5.0|For most people this movie is only about two stage-magicians who battle at outwitting each other by back-stabbing and stealing each others industrious \\"magic tricks\\", but to anyone who knows anything of history, the story is more in depth than that in that it is in fact an homage to Tesla and Edison battling over AC, or Alternating Current, and DC, or Direct Current, and that both men would go to any means necessary to come out on top.<br /><br />The subtle nuances aside, the movie was brilliantly done, and Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine as well as Scarlett Johansson all deserve much praise for this plot-twisting movie.<br /><br />Whether you watched it, or watch it after purchasing it now, and watch it for the magic, or the wizardry of thes powerful men, you will love its suspense and plot-twisting to the bitter end.
B000CCIVDO|3.0|(REAL NAME)     I think these sound great for the money, like more expensive hdphones. I work in sound and was suprised at how nice they were, very warm and detailed. Also I was suprised and annoyed by the comfort of these : non existent. only way they worked to seal outer sound was to clamp them as behind the head style and look ugly. The cups and foam came off in a month more than once and the cable in the band's glue came out. Not comfortable for more than 30 minutes.    What a let down, I mean behringer did a great job with these drivers but would have been done a better job selling them with out the headband!    Good luck...  Comment
B002436WFI|4.0|This is the second attempt to make a movie out of a Terry Pratchett novel and it succeeds rather well.  In this case, the movie is based on the first two novels in the 'Discworld' series, 'The Colour of Magic' and 'The Light Fantastic'.    Rincewind (David Jason), an inept wizard, is expelled from Unseen University. On a dare, he snuck a look at the Octavo, the book used to create the world, and one of the eight great spells lodged in his head.    At the same time, Twoflower (Sean Astin) arrives in Ankh-Morpork to \\"look at it\\".  He's the Discworld's first tourist and he travels with the Luggage, a box made of sapient pearwood that moves about on hundreds of little legs and will follow it's owner everywhere.    After conning Twoflower, Rincewind is dragged to the Patrician's palace and ordered by Lord Vetinari (Jeremy Irons) to guide Twoflower safely through the city.    Twoflower, introducing the concept of fire insurance to Ankh-Morpork, inadvertently causes the entire city to burn down and he and Rincewind escape and Rincewind is plunged into several life threatening situations which he survives by sheer luck.    The good parts of this movie are Jeremy Irons as the Patrician and Tim Curry as Ymper Trymon, second in command of one of the eight orders of wizardry at the university. Both play their roles with relish and Curry's performance is as good, if not better, than that of Cardinal Richelieu in 'The 3 Musketeers'.    The bad parts? Well, a lot of the good scenes in both novels are left out. There is no travelling shop, no Hrun the Barbarian, no flying rock and no Tethis the sea troll. There is also no gingerbread cottage or broomstick flying.     Also, they unfortunately chose a white actor to portray Twoflower, when it's made clear in both 'The Colour of Magic' and 'Interesting Times' that Twoflower is Chinese. A real shame, but Sean Astin does a fantastic job at portraying Twoflower's attitude of looking at the world through rose coloured glasses.    And theygot Cohen the Barbarian's (David Bradley) teeth wrong.    Although this movie takes a while to get going, it does get funnier as it goes along and there are some great one-liners.  \\"I am having a near Rincewind experience.\\"    Christopher Lee reprises the voice of Death, as he did in the animated versions of 'Soul Music' and 'Wyrd Sisters' and he has some of the best parts in the movie.    Aside from the little annoyances, the movie is quite good, the actors are superb, it's got all the wittiness you'd expect from Pratchett, and I loved it.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|I was somewhat skeptical before buying the Blu-ray version.  I never owned VHS or DVD version of this title, so I wasn't sure how this purchase would turn out.  Lacking comparison with those older formats, I still venture to assert this is the best.  Clarity might not be as good as Planet Earth, but the technicians at BBC transferred the original negative onto the Blu-ray with rich colors and amazing details.  In 1080p, this is a great buy!
B0000027G6|5.0|Everything was sent to me in perfect condition, within four days. The CD sounds great as it was brand new and still in the package. My family and I will definitely look toward Amazon.com for future purchases not only for the GREAT prices, but also because of the quickness of service.

B000XA5K48|4.0|I am a huge fan of all things Clive Owen and this film did not disappoint.  Yes it is,(of course) action packed and heart-pounding. However,  it surprised me with its wittiness and fun. Paul Giamatti was great and Monica Bellucii made me a fan.   If you enjoy any of the above, you NEED to see this film. :) ymm
B0000248VB|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying this.  Very cool retro.  Favorites are Experiment in Terror, Peter Gunn, etc.
B00111L0MY|4.0|GBG provided authentic Boston grit, quality acting, and a storyline that keeps you guessing while it leads to a provocative and intense finale.  Rated a 8.5/10 and recommended as one of '07 Top 10.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|Simply put, this is absolutely the best this production has EVER looked on home video, and is likely to be the best it will ever be available given its original 16mm film source.    Most of the scenes look good; some are simply incredible, and of course if you've ever seen it in ANY format you know how good the production, writing and acting is.    If you love this production, you owe it to yourself to buy the Blu-Ray, along with a player AND HDTV if you don't already have them.    For those who aren't into the latest Hollywood blockbusters and wonder if Blu-Ray is for them, this and the recent Fox Blu-Ray of \\"South Pacific\\" make adopting the format a complete no-brainer.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|This is a great Crime/Mob Drama. Story is awesome. Acting is great. Directing is top notch. Very enjoyable movie with a lot of WTF moments. A must see.
B0018N5AXK|5.0|Tired of buying vintage pop rock albums that are full of rice crispies, that sounds like your needle is dragging through sand paper. Fear not I have test played this LP and it is free of the dreaded triplets of snap, crackle and pop.    I don't usually deal in this genre of music, but on  a few occassions pop rock albums come my way and most are junk and are discarded to the scrap heap. This Boston album is an exception to what I generally get in. Plays great.    You can take a chance elsewhere or get this one and know what your getting - The best surprise is no surprise.    After enjoying succes with \\"Boston\\" in 1976 and \\"Don't Look Back\\" in 1978 Boston seemingly disapeared and for the most part where unheard of.    Boston experienced trouble with its original lineup as with the exception of guitarist Tom Scholz and vocalist Brad Delp everybody left.Then came the trials with the company and it seemed like it was the end and the album they were working on was never coming out.Then as a surprise it exploded on the charts in 1986 when it was finally released after an 8 year long wait.It was an instant classic and best of all the trademark Boston sound was still there.    So many bands changed their sound to adapt to the 1980s sound but not Boston,it sounds like classic Boston and its just as good.\\"Third Stage\\" provided plenty of great songs and the band's biggest hit : \\"Amanda\\" which reached # 1 in 1986.The album for some part featured a spaceship concept(songs 2 to 5)and another concept that is maturity(songs 1,6-10)so its sort of a concept album no matter what you say.The songs are mostly great and you'll find yourself to be liking probably each of them,they're all different but they fit really well on the same album.One would think that the two concepts,that is spaceship and maturity,can't go togheter and would rather need to be on seperate albums but it works for \\"Third Stage\\".The mix of songs is good,ballads(Amanda,My Destination...),rocking tracks(Cool The Engines,We're ready...),slower ones(To Be A Man),there's even a combinaison of two songs,\\"I Think I Like It/Can'tcha Say\\"(very good)like they did with \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\" which was present on the first album.The songs don't sound like each other.Exception \\"My Destination\\" which from the first time I heard I recognized as another version of \\"Amanda\\"(slower than Amanda),and to be honnest at first it bothered me but I grew to accept it.\\"A New World\\" had me a little deceved as it rocked and it was great but it turned out to be the (great)intro to \\"To Be A Man\\"(if it isn't then it surely ain't a song on its own!).A few songs from this album wounded up on the \\"Greatest Hits\\" album and I'm glad as their third album is an excellent and much worth-owning one.    'What is left to say?Nothing much,this album would make a great addition to your collection with all the great songs it has and its colourfull music.They managed to come back succesfully when it seemed like they were gone and done and that's not easy but Boston handled the task perfectly.Along with Boston's self-titled debut album this is the absolute best of Boston,\\"Don't Look Back\\" is quite good also,think before getting the greatest hit,this would be really great too.Do I really need to explain my rating?What an easy decision,five stars all the way,\\"Amanda\\" really surprised everybody and the whole album is nothing short of excellent!Much more than an area,AOR band oor whatever name you call them.I can't really say any more,highly recommended!    View the pictures and decide for yourself. Great condition and the jacket is a gatefold, with originial inner sleeve. Vinyl is pristine.

B001DJLCRC|4.0|This a great TV show, in my humble opinion. I bought the DVD based on a 3 min. commercial I saw a year ago and I wasn't disappointed. This is definitely a one man show, where Bryan Cranston cranks out the role of his life. Don't expect to laugh much though, this sure isn't Weeds. Just when our \\"hero's\\" life couldn't get any worse, it sure does! Enjoy

B001F9Y2CM|5.0|I was thinking about trying to collect the full ABBA catalog, but this made it a lot easier to do it all at once. I like the compact format (each CD in a replica of the original album sleeve), instead of the bulk you normally get with a multi-CD box set. 9 CDs don't take up any more room on my CD rack than 3 in jewel cases. I also like the look of the discs themselves; like miniature vinyl records.
B00004RFFI|5.0|although communications were very late i did get word from seller, and was explained the situation. I got the movie, it was what seller said, brand new, awesome movie, will probably shop with seller again.
B00012FXAE|4.0|To set the record straight: this movie is great action sci-fi, highly entertaining and very good looking. But IS NOT better than Alien, so the Amazon reviewer is vastly wrong, and even more when states that Aliens is 'far' better. I would have to agree if someone says that Alien and Aliens are equally great, but never that Aliens is 'far' better.     The main difference between the two is that while Aliens is a great film, Alien is totally a work of art in every level: in cinema, production and art design, visually and musically. Alien musical score stands alone as an indivual masterpiece, something I cannot say about the good James Horner score.       A movie is not better than other only because one has great action sequences and the other not: Alien is more for the patient, a much more cerebral movie that builds the suspense just like anything on Hitchcock's;  it's opening act is total hardcore sci-fi while the scares arrive. Aliens is a good excuse to show bullets blasting aliens, that's it.  Nevertheless, do not be fooled by my comments, Aliens is a must have on any serious sci-fi collection, but get Alien first.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Extremely slick bossa nova record... however that says it all. While it is expertly played and produced, it lacks in soul. While I always had a slight problem with Mrs Krall's productions, this is really boring. It makes great background music though. Her voici is really seductive but she sees herself as a piano player, right? so I am not sure that this is essential at all. Quiet nights indeed...
B001PA0FFO|4.0|Meryl Streep gives another incredible performance in \\"Doubt\\".  Her character is similar to the character she played in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" given they are both total beotches.  There was alot of symbolism in this film with the lights going on and off and the constant interuptions that took place whenever they were discussing something serious.  I can't figure out what they meant but I know they meant something. Technically,  I loved the way Doubt was filmed and I liked the colours they used, the cinematography was excellent. I also enjoyed the costumes.  Story wise, there were alot of unanswered questions throughout the film but I guess it was intentional considering the subject matter of the film, \\"doubt\\".  I didn't really like the ending of the film, I wanted to find out if Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character really did have inappropriate relations with Donald.  He sort of skirted around the issue and never really admitted to anything but i guess this was also intentional for the sake of suspense and mystery.  I thought the film should have been longer and a bit more detail oriented with some of the characters.  The very last scene when Sister Alyosious says she has \\"doubts\\", I didn't fully understand what she meant.  Does she have doubts about the father, does she have doubts about her faith and God?  I guess I'm the type of person who wants some things spelled out for me.
B00008G9JN|5.0|The remaster is great....almost as good as the original vinyl. I am one of those rare Tull fans that has been amazed by every single thing that the band has released. \\"Songs from....\\" is one of the 2 or 3 greatest albums by Jethro Tull. Of course, they are all the greatest for me, but this particular release has \\"Hunting Girl\\", \\"Jack in the Green\\", title cut and the absolutely beautiful \\"Velvet Green\\". Ian's acoustic guitar work, Martin's occasional burst of electric notes, Barrie's percussion, and last but best is John Glascock's very rich and deep harmony vocal. Ian finally found someone to sing with him!! John's voice is a perfect compliment to Ian's and it was tragic that he died so young. I think John would have been in the band for years. He was the wonderful continuation of great bass players for Tull - Glenn Cornick, Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond and John Glascock. Such a wealth of talent for one band. If you appreciate John's work on this album then you should check out some of the tunes on \\"Too Old to.....\\", he is awesome on that album as well. Overall, \\"Songs\\" is one of my personal favorites and one of Ian Anderson's favorites. You should have this in your collection, but then again, \\"Stand Up\\", \\"Benefit\\", \\"Aqualung\\", \\"Thick...\\", \\"Passion Play\\" and many, many more should also be there. Heck, just start with the 1st album and continue from there. There are very few band catalogs that offer as much as Jethro Tull. A wealth of wonderful tunes.....enjoy
B000002AHC|4.0|The Byrds, one of my 5 favorite bands, went through many changes in their first 3 years.  They introduced folk-rock with Jim (Roger) McGuinn as leader, Gene Clark departed, David Crosby's influence increased, they moved to raga-rock and jazz-inspired music, Chris Hillman's influence increased, they leaned toward country-rock, and then came this album.  David Crosby and Mike Clarke would soon be history.  I guess they all knew that this would be their last pop-rock album, because they were moving on to country, and so they were like outlaws, about to flee from the prison of their past.  Thus, the album's title makes sense.<br /><br />And what did the Notorious Byrd Brothers leave behind?  I would say not buried treasure, but VARIED treasure.  Their glorious harmonies and guitar work are as good as ever, and their creative eclecticism is thriving.  Surprising horns open the first track, \\"Artificial Energy\\", which has the sound of Beatlesque mid-tempo pop.  \\"Goin' Back\\", a beautiful folk-rock ballad, sounds more like their earlier tracks than most of the others.  It is my favorite on this album.  \\"Natural Harmony\\", \\"Wasn't Born To Follow\\", \\"Get To You\\" and \\"Change Is Now\\" combine psychedelic and country influences.  \\"Draft Morning\\" is an excellent Vietnam-era track.  In the beginning it echoes the 60's anthem \\"Get Together\\", then moves into horns and psychedelic effects, complete wirh artillery, and \\"Taps\\" is played at the end.  \\"Old John Robertson\\" is almost pure country until you reach the Beatles-string interlude.  \\"Tribal Gathering\\" has a jazzy rhythm and a very strong psychedelic ending.  The Moog Synthesizer is prominent in \\"Dolphin's Smile\\", classic Byrds folk-rock, and in \\"Space Odyssey\\", a serious song about Man's place in the evolution of life in the Milky Way Galaxy.<br /><br />Of the 6 bonus tracks, 3 are instrumentals.  \\"Moog Raga\\" has an Eastern sound patterned after Beatle tracks \\"Love You To\\" and \\"Within You Without You\\".  Synths replace the sitars.  \\"Bound To Fall\\" is country-folk, as is \\"Universal Mind Decoder\\", which is followed by an announcement by the producer of the album and then lots of revealing studio chatter.  Other than the chatter, those 3 tracks aren't that interesting to me.  Nor is there anything significant about the alternate versions of \\"Goin' Back\\" and \\"Draft Morning\\".  The one bonus track that is impressive is \\"Triad\\".  This is a slow, bluesy ballad about a romantic threesome, written and sung very well by Dave Crosby.<br /><br />Although the creativity and musical skills of The Byrds are still evident on this final album of their first chapter, I find that it lacks something overall.  To me, it has a pervading \\"lightness\\" which makes it unable to measure up to the profound quality I hear in \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", \\"Turn Turn Turn\\" and \\"Fifth Dimension\\".  Still, if you are now or ever were a Byrd-watcher, it is a good album to have.country-folk, as is \\"Universal Mind Decoder\\", which is followed by an announcement by the producer of the album and then lots of revealing studio chatter.

B00006JKOM|4.0|I'm a Tull fanatic (read my \\"Songs from the Wood\\" review) and one of the best parts of that album is listening to the singing and bass playing of John Glascock. It's so great to know that Tull fans out there really appreciated what John brought to the band. He is also perfect for \\"Too Old to....\\". We all missed Jeffrey's playing and humorous lunacy but John brings a new element to Tull. This album is not one of my personal favorites but it does include \\"Crazed Institution\\" and \\"Salamander\\". It also makes \\"Songs from\\" come out of left field as a follow-up album. You could never have anticipated this album being wedged between \\"Minstrel\\" and \\"Songs\\". But that is the magic of Tull. Most of the reviews for \\"Too Old\\" feature a small comment about John Glascock. This is a good thing....
B001TOD92C|1.0|Buy?? You know a special edition with commentary and better extras has to be coming out.  We've got to stop jumping at these lesser releases and teach the studios not to double-dip.
B000002J1O|5.0|You have to have this album even if you are a prog head that doesn't really appreciate early Genesis (unthinkable). \\"Selling England...\\" has \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight\\" and \\"Cinema Show\\"....enough said. Steve Hackett's ghostly guitar work never sounded better, Phil Collins sings harmony vocals throughout the entire album (including the entire song \\"I Know What I Like\\". Every member of Genesis shines on this release. I really enjoy \\"Firth of Fifth\\" with Steve's majestic guitar solo. Yes, \\"Battle of Epping Forest\\" is quite wordy, but I'll take this anyday instead of \\"Sledgehammer\\". A prog list for all times should include \\"Selling England\\", but don't forget \\"In the Court\\" by King Crimson, \\"Passion Play\\" by Tull, \\"Close to the Edge\\" by Yes, 2112, etc. etc.....This album is Genesis at the height of their progressive powers. Buy it today and wear it out.....so very Britissshhhhhh, love.....
1416955070|5.0|More of my reviews at [...]      I bought this book when it came out here in Spain, a month ago more or less. I had heard about it but I hadn't planned to read it, but that day I was walking through the bookshop when I saw it, and since I didn't had anything to read I decided to give it a try and honestly IT DOESN'T DISAPPOINT. Actually it has ended being my second favourite book (right after Twilight series).    Only to think the wonderful book I could have not read if that day I hadn't bought it... Anyway, I think I'd have ended up buying it because there are reviews of this series everywhere.      I really liked the idea of an urban paranormal book.     I found this book was written in a very nice way, without abusing of the descriptions but letting you know the necessary to represent the imaginary scene in your head and driving you right into the story.     The thing I enjoyed the most was the fact that I could feel the same Clary was feeling; whenever she was scared my face was showing fear, whenever she was happy I couldn't help but to draw a smile in my face, and whenever she was sad or nervous I couldn't stop feeling the same way. And Yes, I cried a little at the end of the book because I don't want (and I know I'm not the only one who thinks this way*) that love story to end like this.    Another thing I loved about this book is the fact that while reading you don't have any more information than Clary I mean, in this book you don't know how the others feel, you don't have any other details of what's happening apart of what Clary sees, feels and knows, and so in this kind of book helps to keep the intrigue and the interest. As the final was getting closer I was shaking while guessing what was going to happen and I was very sad as Clary and I discovered the truth.      If I have to talk about the characters I definitely have to mention Jace. I liked Clary's character but I liked Jace's character the most with difference. I fell deeply in love with him. His not the typical character that is mysterious but kind to the girl. He's arrogant and very determined. He likes doing the thinks his way and he doesn't mind very much what others think about him.     I feel sorry for Simon but sometimes he was a bit annoying.      Overall: I loved this book and I will patiently wait for the next books as for the next works of the author.

B00000J7J4|2.0|Supernaturual is more of a Carlos Santana then a Santana album since it includes none of the orignial members of Santana except for Carlos Sanatana. The music on here is pretty good but it just doesent have the same sound as from there first three albums, plus why the heck does it include guest vocals from Dave Matthews and Everlast?, What was Carlos Santana thinking because there vocals bassicly ruined the songs they sung on. The albums moods range from jazzy, latin rock, and latin pop. Songs like, \\"Maria Maria\\", are horrible and dont even sound like Santana also songs like, \\"Do You Like The Way\\", \\"African Bamba\\", and \\"Smooth\\", just are latin pop songs that do not deserve a place on a Santana album. I still dont get why so many people say this one of the best Santana albums whereas in my opinion its not really that good at all. Yet this album does hold up some gems like, \\"(Da Le) Yaleo\\" but thats about it. So if you want to pick up some real Santana pick up there first three albums.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|I saw the American version of this movie when it was originally released in 1994. It blew me away but it was apparent to me even then that it had been edited! I was so thrilled to finally get to see the director's cut which is much more witty, sophisticated and really explores the uncharted territory of human emotions.<br /><br />Although on the surface it is a fairly forthright tale of loss and revenge with a very sympathetic 12-year-old protagonist and a 40 something antihero, it cleverly reverses the emotional maturity of the pair, Matilde is obviously smarter, more cunning and more sexually mature than the emotionally dead hitman who reluctantly takes her in after she is orphaned.<br /><br />Leon is terribly antisocial, illiterate, slow witted and appears to be sexually immature. Once Matilde comes into his life, his actions are that of an adolescent falling in love for the first time.  The precocious girl smokes, curses, drinks, has murderous tendencies and is a habitual liar. The directors cut not only allows us to experience Leon as a professional killer and as a teacher, but allows us to watch the prepubescent Matilde trying to seduce the first man she loves.<br /><br />The prudish editing initially deprived the viewer of watching the robotic Leon and the abused Matilde experience emotional growth which awakens in them both the human desires we all have: to love someone and want to be with them and share the rest of your life with them. These two people are not normal and will never be, the fact that love blossoms between them is an affirmation of the human heart even in the worst of circumstances.<br /><br />This is a brilliant movie with an extraordinary cast and director and gritty NYC is the perfect location for it. Dressed in her thrift store wardrobe, Natalie Portman is brilliant and should have won her Oscar for this role, she has never lived up to the bright promise she showed here. Enjoy!
B000IOM0WY|5.0|The cast perform well together, the action is top-notch and the storyline keeps you interested.   A worthy remake of an old film.
B000M5B6Q0|4.0|Grant and Barrymore are excellent performers and most of their work is pretty good.  There was a combination of superb acting, story line, and music that make this movie just so wonderful.  The ensemble aspect with the other actors was also just the best.  The on-screen chemistry between Grant and Barrymore was so significant, that one could believe that they were lovers in real life.  The music is so warm and enduring.  I have purchased both the movie sound track, sheet music, and movie DVD.  Good job G&B!
B0012JEIGU|5.0|The Scarecrow is an entity of epic proportions, a legendary opus of the metal gods that will leave you wanting more.  It immediately hits you with Twisted Mind, then the masterpiece title track blows you away.  At least it blew me away.  I have listened to this album many, many times, and I never get sick of it.  Tobias Sammet definately shines here, as he does in the other Avantasia works, not to mention his main band Edguy.      The album is totally different from the Metal Opera albums, yet it still delivers as much, if not more than those CD's.  Some may think this work of art is not the same Avantasia that Tobias conceived with the Metal Opera, and therefore it is inferior, but I say it is better.  It is more mature, rocks harder, and in my opinion, has better guest vocals than the previous offerings.      If you like classic metal, hair metal, power metal,or hard rock, get this album.
0449000729|5.0|If you enjoy Celtic history, enjoy British history...this novel is a wonderful combination of fact, fiction and imagination. The characters are totally alive. One must pay close attention however, because centuries pass and character connections can become muddled. All said though, I've enjoyed ALL of this writer's works.
B001PA0FFO|1.0|I wouldn't normally review a popular movie that has already been reviewed, mostly very favorably, almost a hundred times, and I don't imagine many people are going to read this review, but I can't resist.  \\"Doubt\\" is one of the worst movies I've seen in years, and I have no doubt about that.  I won't even bother with the hopelessly stagey quality of the film.  Instead I'll confine myself to its intellectual pretensions.  The film sets itself up as a \\"drama of ideas,\\" with Streep and Hoffman representing mighty opposites.  Streep's character is supposed to represent the \\"old church\\" based on discipline and tradition, whereas Hoffman's represents the new wave of compassion and friendliness (virtue vs. love, as the movie idiotically frames it).But Streep's character is so monstrous she can't represent anything except maybe psychpathology. She is obsessed by a hatred of ballpoint pens (personally, I agree on that one), sugar and Frosty the Snowman (which occasions the immortal line quoted above).  Streep is quite good (though toward the end even she begins to chew the scenery), but the role really should have been played by Cloris Leachman (a la her part in \\"High Anxiety\\").  Hoffman essentially plays Pat O'Brien in \\"Angels with Dirty Faces\\" (or perhaps Bing Crosby in \\"Going My Way\\").  Hoffman's a great actor, but he's totally wasted in this one-dimensionsal role.  In fact he seems a little bored by it. The film introduces a phony ambiguity about what really went on between the priest and the boy, presumably to introduce doubt on the part of the viewer.  But the alleged ambiguity derives from absolutely nothing in the rest of the film, and Hoffman's character is so decent and Streep's so crazy, that the \\"ambiguity\\" is just a pretense of complexity in a movie notable only for its simple-mindedness.  I won't \\"spoil\\" the movie's ridiculous ending, but it too comes out of nowhere.  It might have made a good final line as the curtain comes down in a theater, but it couldn't be sillier in this context.  Movies like this succeed because they give people the impression they're thinking without actually making them think.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I have never really felt the need to write a review for a movie (and I have seen MANY), but this movie was such a wonderful surprise that I could not resist. I was not sure what to expect going into this movie because the cast consisted of, for me, virtually unknown actors; however, I immediately fell in love with all of the cast, especially Brad Rowe and Trevor Wright. This touching, romantic, and, at times, heartbreaking story is now one of my absolute favorites, and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a thoughtful and poignant story about life and about love- the real kind.
0930289234|5.0|Zack Snyder and company tried to do it, but this epic is too big for film.
B001993Y2C|5.0|Like so many people on line at the moment, I was one of those people that grew up through the STAR WARS era.  And like those ones I remember watching BSG on ITV here in the UK at the weekends.  I really enjoyed it as a boy.  It was full of exciting action, brilliant models, FX that looked like STAR WARS FX, a sense of loyalty and friendship that my emerging personality was starting to experience in real life as well as really pretty girls in tight military uniforms!    Now, 30 years have passed and new BSG has been and now gone.  The one of the differences on this occasion is that the show was allowed to run its course.  The whole story was told from start to finish, thank you BABYLON 5.      And like BABYLON 5, the new BSG demonstrates that not everything is quite how it seems.  The very clear blacks and whites of the original BSG are nowhere near as clearly defined as they once were.  There is alot of grey in there, wherein most of actual real life seems to take place.  There are freindships tested to the limit, there are peolpe who feel inadequate to the jobs but have to do them anyway, there is a huge amount of bad decision making as a well as out-and-out back stabbing betrayal and murder.  There are conflicted interest and personalities as well as insanity and despair.    But the thing that binds it all together is the story.  Over four years, the story has had us (us being my wife and myself) excited, angry, disappointed, amused, happy, sad, confused, let down, depressed, enlightened, shocked, surprised, baffled and amazed.  All the things that real life does to a person.    Like all good SF, Mr Moore and his staff have taken all the elements of life and the things that affect us as people and wrapped them in an SF cover.  He has woven a story that includes those affectations and given us four years of great TV.    If you took all the SF elements away from this show (and I think the aforementioned BABYLON 5), it would probably still work as a war drama, because the show is about the people being affected and NOT the actual space battles or how big the explosions were, or how good the costumes looked.    From now on, there is a third all-time-favourite show in my mind to share equal billing with CLASSIC STAR TREK and BABYLON 5.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|First, no, this should never have been compared to \\"Gone with the Wind.\\" The location is different, the war is different, and the circumstances are different! Perhaps the only similarity in characters is between the overseers, specifically Fletcher of Australia's Faraway Downs and the overseer of Tara plantation in Gone with the Wind. Nicole Kidman's \\"English Rose\\" who toughens up fast does not compare with Vivien Leigh's portrayal of the ruthless Scarlett O'Hara. Thankfully, the Drover does not compare to \\"Gone with the Wind's\\" decadent Rhett Butler either!<br />Naturally, the Australian aborigines are completely different from the black southern American slaves (who probably really ran the plantations). Nullah, the winsome lad from whose viewpoint the tale is mostly told, is the character that really makes the story work. If anyone gives a performance worthy of an Oscar in this film, it's this promising young actor, Brandon Walters, whom I dearly hope to see more of!<br />Otherwise, yes, if you are a Hugh Jackman fan, you will find the movie worth seeing for his competent portrayal of the gorgeously rugged, diamond-in-the-rough Drover. Will mention that a friend of mine thought that the portion when the Drover appeared at the ball resplendent in his tuxedo was \\"Disneyesque,\\" and, yes, my friend's viewpoint is valid. Perhaps Baz Luhrmann thought to show that the \\"diamond-in-the-rough\\" could successfully take on polish.<br />Since this is a review rather than a social commentary, I won't get trapped into going on at length about the disgraceful way Australian aborigines were treated. Being American, that would be like the pot calling the kettle black (pun - if anyone sees it - is intentional). As someone who's bi-racial (possibility tri-racial), I can say that it's important to be aware that damage has been done and then get on with it - \\"it\\" being working at being fair, starting with oneself.<br />In any event, see and enjoy Australia. No, it may not be \\"realistic,\\" but one goes to movies to escape, not to be further confronted with grim reality. We get enough of that in our dreary, day-to-day lives!o movies to escape, not to be further confronted with grim reality. We get enough of that in our dreary, day-to-day lives!
B0007O38XU|5.0|This movie is a classic and awesome. Space Balls is along the lines of Scary movie but better. I like scary movie but I am just saying it is a classic movie and classics are just awesome.<br /><br />It parodies Star Wars, Planet of the Apes, Alien, ext and in a classic not stupid way. There are even some star trek refferences in here. I wish I would have known of this movie sooner. This one is not to be missed pick it up and enjoy it and trust me you will.

B000G7PNAE|5.0|\\"Escape\\" is one of Journey's biggest sellers to date and its not hard to see why.  Even though only three of the albums ten tracks were released as singles, they're really all winners here.  This is definitely a far cry from Journey's initial jazz oriented sound; back before frontman Steve Perry joined.  Back then, the band could care less about crafting hit singles and was more concerned about recording long running progressive instrumentals.  But when Perry came on board, he brought with him a sense of pop songcraft.  Suddenly, the band made power-ballads instead of rock-suites.  This should have meant with dissapointing results but what we actually got was some of the best arena rock ever.      Many of Journey's progressive tendencies remain: Neal Schon's guitar pyrotechnics, acoustic guitar textures (most notably on \\"Mother, Father\\") and the fact that the band rocks just as hard as ever.  Tracks like, \\"Stone In Love\\" and \\"Dead Or Alive\\" are raunchy in your face rockers that beat out anything The Rolling Stones were doing at that time.  The showcase here of course is the ballads.  The three singles \\"Don't Stop Believing\\", \\"Who's Crying Now\\", and \\"Open Arms\\" have become definitive power-ballad standards.  Possibly the best ballad here, however, is \\"Mother, Father\\" which build from its gentle acoustic opening to a colossal rocker featuring one of Perry's best vocal performances.    All ten of the album's tracks could have been released as singles and they probably would have charted.  That's how strong this album is.  Though some commercial rock is pretty bland and unchallenging, this is not the case here.  This is proof that even commercialized rock can provide for an exhilarating listen.  If you enjoy other classic rock bands like Boston, Styx, or Foreigner, than you must purchase this album.    This remastered edition contains four bonus tracks including three live tracks recorded at Houston.  A nice way to see how Journey was in concert.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|A wonderfully creative abuse of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" crossed with \\"Emma\\" as modern-day Amanda Price desperately tries to remake the matches in Regency England which her presence has ruined. Many of the characters are not as they seem, among them charming rogue Wickham. Every character is perfectly cast; even the bit parts add rich detail to the dramatic tapestry. Settings and costumes seem beautifully authentic and often simply beautiful. An absolutely delightful film.
B000AMU0XA|4.0|Yes, It is one of the best albums of the 80s. As for Sound it is the best album of the 80s one of the first full digital recordings. However one problem the current release is not the original album. It's missing the album version of \\"Two Tribes\\" which is twice as long as the single version(which is the current version) and a track called \\"Happy Hi\\".
B001DHXT1G|5.0|The Hulk from a few years back left a bit to be desired, which is probably a bit of an understatement.  Poor CGI, disjointed and really not that good.  Note as horrible as many have said, but for a treatment of a popular comic book charactor, not well done.    This one, thankfully, does alot better job on the Green Hero.  It starts off well from the opening where the credits include a montage and homage to the Huk in other forms, including the old television show (and there are other nods to Mrbel heros in the movie.)    In this Ed Norton plays Dr. Bruce Banner and does a very good job with the role.  When I heard he was going to play the role I was happy in the fact he is such a good actor, but was a bit hesitant as how he could pull off Banner, who I think as a bit milder, but it all came together very well in his potrayal.    The others in the movie also do a very good job in bringing comic book personas to lie and Liv Tyler and William Hurt as two people with rather different outlooks on Bannner ineract very well and help the story move forward.    The CGI is alot better, but I am not sure if it was as good as it could be.  I think part of this was more for me looking a bit more than I normally would for the CGI since the older movie was so bad.  In others words I never said \\"Yikes!\\" when watching.    Give this movie a try if you like comic book movies, and more so if you sat through the 2003 movie and was dissapointed in how The Hulk came out when it hit the big screen back then.  This was a big improvement.
B00005JL0I|4.0|This was a great movie. It seems as if every time it can't get any crazier, some new unbelievable thing happens that escalates until that very strange fight at the end. While this definitely isn't the best take on the book Casino Royale, it sure is fun to watch. It seems like the kind of thing where whenever the directors had some strange idea, they said \\"What the heck!\\" and threw it into the movie. This is definitely a great movie to watch. Just be prepared for anything.

0375757856|5.0|Like the Woman in White, The Moonstone is written in multiple narratives and is considered  one of Wilkie Collins best novels.  The Moonstone refers to a yellow diamond that Rachel Verinder unexpectedly inherits on her eighteenth birthday. The diamond, although of immense value, was stolen from a sacred Hindu statue by Rachel's corrupted uncle, Colonel Herncastle.     Rachel's cousin and love interest, Franklin Blake, is entrusted to deliver the diamond to his cousin at a birthday dinner party. The night of the party, the diamond vanishes without a trace. After the diamond's disappearance, a series of strange events occur: a maid unexpectedly commits suicide and Rachel Verinder absolutely refuses to cooperate with the investigation of her missing diamond. Sergeant Cuff, who is charge of the investigation, announces from the get-go that this was an inside job!    The Moonstone is not for readers who expect or need instant gratification. This novel reads somewhat slow compared to other novels, such as The Woman in White. The mystery behind the diamond's theft is something that unfolds gradually, yet will fascinate you from page one to the end.     The reader is presented with a series of suspects and motives each described in detail from a cast of unforgettable characters, such as Gabriel Betteredge, Drusilla Clack, and Ezra Jennings. If this sounds like an Agatha Christie novel to you, that's because The Moonstone is considered THE novel that inspired the birth of the mystery novel. Not my favorite Wilkie Collins novel, that will always be The Woman in White, yet The Moonstone is not a novel to be considered second-best to anything. To quote Charles Dickens \\"A very curious story, wild and yet domestic with excellent characters in it and great mystery.\\"

1416914307|4.0|I was so excited when I got this book months ago. My expectations were so high--I mean, it is the last book in the Mortal Instruments series.<br /><br />So, I immediately read it and let's just say it wasn't what I was expecting.<br /><br />Clare started throwing in these \\"hints\\" to what was going to happen. Now, if you pay close attention to the book, they won't be hints. They'll be sentences telling you what is going to happen. That's the one thing that irked me the most. The predictability and the fact that Clare practically told us all the clue and what was going to happen near the beginning.<br /><br />The gang was back in this action-packed, full of twists (that you could see coming a mile away), and revealing book. In this book we find out more about Jace, Clary, and Sebastian. The Jace/Clary big question is answered; Jocelyn reveals her side of the story; and Valentine gets what he deserves.<br /><br />Another small thing that bothered me was that in some scenes it felt as if Clary had lost her mind cus she did dumb/dangerous things that she couldn't save herself from; she needed someone to help her out.<br /><br />Clare's writing was really good but she really needs to work on the whole hint thing in order not to reveal everything at the beginning. I liked that the ending gave closure and at the same thing it left you wondering what happened to some of the characters.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />City of Glass won't disappoint fans of the series and the ending is just what they were expecting. Just try not to read it too carefully and you won't find the book predicable. The action in the book will leave you gasping and it will keep you in the edge of the seat. Overall a satisfying conclusion to this series. Clare does know how to leave her fans wanting more and even though this is the last book, you'll be highly anticipating her new series, Infernal Devices.<br /><br />-Carol<br />[...]
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Australia is a very interesting movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat and spell bound throughout the movie.  I recomend it for all ages.  A very satisfied customer with my purchase of Australia -- MKT
B001TH16DS|5.0|I am probably one of the few that actually own it. I am a reviewer and have an early copy. It looks and sounds magnificent. Each of the 7 Blu-ray discs are dual-layered (47+ Gig) and each episode takes up between 7.5 - 12 Gig of space. I've compared screen grabs to the old 2000 DVDs on the DVDBeaver website and anyone can plainly see the incredible superiority. The image is stunning and the 7.1 sound is over 4000 kpbs. These are even better transfers than the HD-DVDs.<br />I give a very strong recommendation. Great value in my opinion.
B00110K62U|5.0|I fell in love with this concert and had it on VHS. I was thrilled when it came out on DVD. The quality is everything I was hoping for and I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Sister Aloysius is the dragon lady principal, the no-nonsense taskmaster, and the moral absolutist of the Catholic school in this film.  She terrifies the students and maintains strict order even at meals with the other sisters.  Then, through a series of misunderstandings, misperceptions, and suspicions, she starts to have doubts about the behavior of Father Flynn, who has befriended the only black child in the school and has tried to defend him from the other kids.  Without revealing the specifics, I'll just say that Sister A. goes on a mission to destroy Flynn's career and record because she believes fervently that her own suspicions are somehow proof of wrongdoing on his part.  Her manipulation of Sister James, whom she pressures, adds to the amount of damage she tries to inflict.         By the end, you will see how important it is to give others the benefit of the doubt when you truly do not have all the facts or even any evidence at all.  By the time that lesson is learned, however, it might be too late for some of the parties involved.       At first I wasn't sure if Hoffman was up to the task of playing a priest, but he was in fine tune.  Streep was fascinating and frightening to watch, while Amy Adams gave a nicely nuanced performance as Sister James.

0143038583|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ THIS YEAR, AND EVERYONE SHOULD READ IT BECAUSE EACH OF US CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON WHAT IS BEING DONE TO THE HUMAN FOOD CHAIN AND THE PLANET BY THOSE SEEKING PROFIT ABOVE HEALTH AND A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT. ALTHOUGH THE BOOK IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE USA AND ITS FOOD INDUSTRY, THE SPREAD OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM AND PRODUCTION METHODS MEAN THAT ALL OF US ARE IN DANGER OF GOING DOWN THE SAME ROAD - CURRENT SMALL ATTEMPTS TO REFORM THOSE SYSTEMS NOTWITHSTANDING. ALL OF US NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT AUTHOR MICHAEL POLLAN IS SAYING ABOUT INDUSTRIAL AND 'ORGANIC' FOODS AND TO SUPPORT A POLYFACE APPROACH TO FOOD PRODUCTION.  POLLAN'S DISCUSSION OF VEGANISM AND VEGATERIANISM ARE COGENT AND THOUGHTFUL AND WERE MOST HELPFUL TO ME IN CLARIFYING MY OWN POSITION OF THIS ISSUE.  FIVE STARS.
B000002URV|5.0|A friend turned me on to Enigma and what a wonderful gift that was!  I love to listen to this cd when I'm feeling a bit down, or when I want to just relax or take a few minutes to meditate.  It seems to help balance my moods, and if I'm too keyed up to sleep at night, I put the headphones on and drift off to sleep.  It's different from anything else I listen to........and I love it!  Try it and I think you will enjoy it as well.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|Considering i have YET to receive this movie after 6 weeks! i can't give a review -- i'm pissed!
B0015DYIH2|3.0|Like many I started reading the Twilight Saga recently--last week.  And after just finishing Breaking Dawn I found as a whole series a solid 4 stars.  It is compelling enough after the initial first chapters of Twilight to start reading with non-stop fervor until you're done.  I didn't complain one bit as by Eclipse some things rang out as repetitive and slightly obvious.  But by Breaking Dawn I was going yadda yadda yadda in my head when it came to certain issues, like Edward being the man of the hour and the Bella/Jacob relationship.  And how unsurprised I was about Jacob's imprinting situation, which I found was the first major disappointment.  No, actually I take that back, the first major disappointment I felt was how Bella was lovey dovey over her pregnancy (Broke a rib guys.  But don't worry about me, it's all for the baby!  Quick can't feel my legs.  It's OK, for the baby!).  Once again, the predictability:  Carlisle (I pitied him in the end `cause I forgot he even existed for a short time during the epic Battle of Not) is out during the great pregnancy emergency.  Well of course, this would be the best time to step out; it's not like she hasn't had a hard pregnancy and is due any day now.  Guess Carlisle's banking on that 1st time pregnancy past due date kicking in at any moment.        And the change (or non-change as others see it) of Bella never bothered me.  Even vampire year one build up (Oh, schucks that blood thing, do I really crave it?  Looks kinda gross) didn't bother me as by that point you could tell Bella was going to be the best little vampire out there.  Gosh and her super natural ability was mastered just in time.  Predictable.  So sadly was her ability.  Like a mama got to shield he younglings.  I found some of the other vampires more interesting.  Benjamin's relationship with his creator was also intriguing, though disappointing that he ran after Amun to go join him again after essentially given freedom.       The battle that didn't happenseems to be a big issue with a lot.  Funny, I wasn't so disappointed in it.  I found it interesting, but only to the degree of what you can turn it into in the future.  If Meyer's ever decides to write in the Bella/Edwards universe again it would be more appropriate to pick up later on (perhaps as little as two years) where they actually do fight the Volturi.  The Volturi or more Aro really can't stand how it ended, bad rep and all, so he does send out his people to slowly slaughter witnesses etc.  The ending days of the system.  If done right it could turn into something worth picking up again and reading.  However, if this is the end of the story \\"forever and forever\\", then...no.  It is too happily ever after, bound off into the sunset for me.  Didn't need a slaughter, but for goodness sakes explain Marcus more, I get it he looks \\"bored.\\"  (I know he's explained in some sites, but I'm talking about actually in the book explain him.)  Maybe Bella (on a whim) could have shielded him, and in a moment of insight he walks over to Chelsea and kills her straight out, and let the chips fall as they may.      The three books (narrations) didn't bug me, actually enjoyed Jacob's POV and his camaraderie with his pack and Sam's.  Though I would have laughed if Leah imprinted on Nahuel.  After all if Bella gets a happy ending, why not Leah?  I think she got the losing end of the stick during the whole series.   Can't believe Jacob didn't get her earlier with all the Bella angst.  By the way what is with the love triangles?  Come on, I thought Billy was nicely set for a little romance there.      Was not a fan of Renesmee.  From the time she was born onward she had zero factors in the appeal area.  And as she spoke like an adult when she was a wee child, I kept having Dune flashbacks.  But once again she actually would be interesting later in life, as her ability matured.  Honestly can't see what good giving flash backs are, but oh well.      Basically I wish the book was better, and slightly darker.  Some say this book was written for adults, I have to disagree.  I think the book works fine for teens who don't have all the plots of Wuthering Heights (though that one is doubtful) and all the other books Meyer's mentioned locked in their head debating where Meyer's is going with her story.  The sex scenes of course were not detailed or really even spoken of (read waaaayyy more in teen fiction when I was young).  And Bella's pregnancy didn't surprise me or make me cringe about her age.  Even her delivery wasn't too bad.  I mean we were warned enough what to expect, it's not like she was going to have a natural human birth or anything.  Though, I was surprised that Charlie was able to live considering he knew all about this and that.  Even on a \\"need to know basis\\" he still knew more than he should.  Oh and J. Jenks, could of done without that whole side story.  Alice still doesn't bug me and Emmett became my favorite character in the end.  Though I think Jasper's backstory and his angst could make an excellent read as well.  And even though we know the summary, if done right.....    Overall, Breaking Dawn wasn't too bad if you didn't have higher than usual expectations.  Meyer's could have finished the story stronger and more twists that I think a growing and maturing audience needs and expects.  But that fact is she didn't and for a teen book she did fine.  Her saga is definitely worth the read.  And for reading the last installment I am not upset.  Bella got her man and vise-versa.  And after all wasn't that what we all really wanted?      (Yes, the answer is yes.)

B001HN697M|5.0|Romantic literature is by far my favorite kind, and I often come across a movie or other media that captures its very essence. This third Underworld movie does it in a magnificent way: from the heightened feelings of love and hate, the pairings of life and death, to the escapist medieval setting with its castles and woods and ominous presences lurking in the shadows. It's a gothic story at its prime.<br />Performances are more than satisfactory; especially Sheen, who does a great job as our new-found hero Lucian. Special effects are stunning, especially considering the relative low budget of the production.<br />Overall, I left the theater very pleased and hope Screen Gems takes us back to the Underworld sooner than later.
0783231032|4.0|I actually bought this movie as a birthday present for my adult son. He said he enjoyed the movie years ago, plus the fact that some of the delete scenes cut from the original movie were restored. I have yet to watch the movie myself(I saw it years ago),but I will watch it when I have time in the future. Thank you!
0060926317|5.0|This book has opened my eyes to the wisdom of the \\"real people\\" and left me wanting to learn more. Everything about this book rings true to me. I recommend it highly.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This is a great movie.  I find it amazing that the people who gave this movie a one star rating do it only because it was full of gore.  Seriously?  So you wanted another fake, bloodless movie about Jesus' gruesome death?  It is a mockery of the death of Jesus to show it in any other way.  Other movies are so fake--they show Jesus getting beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross and he comes out of it looking as if nothing more had happened to him than he maybe got a few bad paper cuts.  It's about time someone showed it like it was.  If you don't like the gore...maybe you could pray REAL hard and ask God to go back in time and make the beating, flogging, and crucifixion of Jesus less bloody because it offends you.  I read one review that said that Mel just wants us all to feel guilty for doing this to Jesus because He did it for our sins.  That's so ridiculous it hardly deserves a response.  Maybe instead we should look at it in the light that Jesus loved us so much that He came to earth to save us KNOWING that this is exactly what would happen to Him--ever bit of pain He felt, He knew He would feel that before He came to earth.  Thank You Jesus!
B00005RDRO|5.0|Still one of my favorite who'dun'it films with a classic all-star cast.  If you enjoyed the movie Clue (although set to a board game theme) this might interest you.
159448385X|5.0|It took a few chapters to really pull me in, but I ended up loving this book. For people who don't pay attention to the world around them, it would be a good look at how people live in other countries. I definitely came away with a renewed sense of gratitude for living in a free country. It's amazing to me how oppressed people can maintain optimism.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|\\"I cant get stoned enough to agree with any favorable reviews\\"? Nice one Kevin-A self proclaimed \\"biggest fan\\"? Wow your credentials are really shining. Especially when you have to be stoned to appreciate anything by Steven Wilson.<br />Insurgentes is a darn good album. It's as well crafted as anything Steven does. He puts 100% into every release and every project and it shows right here. If you like variety, loads of atmosphere and talent behind what you're listening to, then this is it.
B000006UD8|5.0|I always liked this album -but when I switched to cds I opted for made in japan- and kinda forgot about this since its alot of the same material- then I bought this special 2 disc edition- I got to say this blew me away especially the first disc ( which I listened to second) iT SOUNDS AS GOOD AS  ANY OF MY SACD DISCS- dont get me wrong the second disc is great also- but the 1997 remixs just blew me away- it really gave me a rush- its superfreacking fantastic dont waste any time buy this 2 disc set now and get ready to take off. Once upon a time in Michigan a young man took mescaline on a cold novemeber night. There was a thick and fluffy snow that fell so slow. That night he got in his car. And took a ride- there was just the snow thick and slow, the road, and his headlights on a old country road And it felt like he was in the tunnel of a highway star.<br />and they all lived happily ever after<br />Amen
B001PPLIFU|4.0|I have seen \\"Casino Royale\\" many times in Blu-ray and looked forward to seeing its sequel, \\"Quantum of Solace\\".  After seeing this film twice (once in the theater and once in Blu-ray), I was a little disappointed.  Granted, Craig is excellent as always as the newly re-invented Bond (quite a change from the silly Roger Moore Bonds!) and the action is plentiful--yet the ending of this sequel was unresolved--or else Paul Haggis just wanted us to imagine what happened to the agent Bond was stalking and holding responsible for Vesper Lind's death. Outside of that if you're a Bond fan, you won't be disappointed and the Blu-ray transfer is even better than the first one.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Mama Mia took us by surprise.  What are these other-than-musical actors doing headlining a musical.    The characters were great.  The actors fit the characters.  It was fun, fun, fun.    The second time we liked it more.    We look forward to seeing it the next time we're ready for an upper.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I'm glad to see that Season Four is slated for release in the not-too-distant future. This is a really great series and I think the folks in charge should be commended for keeping it moving along without getting bogged down like so many other shows have done in the past. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are perfectly cast and neither could be adequately replaced, so let's hope nothing happens to make that necessary. Another bonus in this series is the awesome transfer to DVD. I'm watching these episodes on my upconverting player and a 1080-p television and the picture is almost identical to the high-def broadcasts! I haven't seen any other DVD's with this quality of video and probably won't since the folks at Sony are trying to sell Blu-Ray and transfers like these make it unnecessary to switch. The detail in the closeups is astounding, nothing like the blurry and artifacted transfers done to a lot of programs. If you haven't watched these via an HDMI upconverting player you're in for a real treat. The quality has been there since season one and I hope it is still there in season 4. In terms of interest and casting I rate this show alongside of The Invaders, a show I watched during my high school years. Obviously the special effects are much more advanced today, but good actors are always good actors. One last thing: keep those season sets coming!

B001ILFUDM|5.0|Disney Studios reached their peak with Pinocchio. The level of detail is just phenomenal, and Blue Ray really showcases it like never before. The extra features are also very well done.
0792164903|1.0|And I don't remember a single thing about it except for the fact that Johnny Depp is in it and it is about the legend of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow. This movie was and is entirely forgettable. The characters, the plot, the dialogue, the scenery--everything about it is simply forgettable. I have seen much better versions of the legend, and I remember most of them pretty well. Forget this one and focus on other, better movies about the same topic.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I was skeptical about this series after watching the first episode, but I gave it another shot and found myself enjoying it more and more.  It's a type of show that doesn't take itself too seriously, despite some of the more serious plot elements, like murder. Anna Paquin is fantastic, along with several other members of the cast.<br /><br />Sure, the show's a little cheesy at times, but I think the writers are aware of that and it seems to add to the charm.  Yes, there is a lot of gratuitous sex, but at least it's interesting sex and should probably be expected from an HBO program.<br /><br />Overall, I think this show is just dirty fun.
B001IMFHTS|5.0|This set is incredible. Everything is amazing - The music, The interpretation and The execution. The Sound quality and the video are unreal as well. Just get it, you will not be dissapointed
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|WHen first watching this film I felt it was a slow moving film that reminderd me of the German version of The Graduate.  I was wrong, it is a film that you defintely have to stay with meaing don't go back to the fridge if you do not have to. There is a lot of nudity in this film tastefully done if it can be. It is in the end all a question of guilt and how deep it runs. There are a lot of scences featuring a bathtub it being in many sensual scenes whether it was necessary or not I would give the film a chance. BRAVO KATE you deserved that gold statue.
B0017APQ1K|3.0|For those unfamiliar with the movie, it's a film about gangs in New York during the civil war fighting for control over the Five Points. This review is more of a review for the Blu-Ray, not the movie itself. I'd say based on the movie alone, it's a good 5 star for those interested in some dark history of New York.<br /><br />For the transfer of this film, it's horrible. The noise is filtered in some scenes enough to make the film seen 'dirty' or blurred. The blacks seem to bleed a bit in dark scenes and for those with LCD screens, expect to notice some motion blur during these scenes. I never notice motion blur on my Samsung, but this movie (and Donnie Darko) are blur in any scene with shadows. I really think this is due to all of the horrible noise filters. At time's, the Butcher's hate (a green color) has movement issues towards the end. You can see details moving around that just doesn't look right. This really only applies to the video quality, as the uncompressed PCM audio is very nice (a little low in areas though).<br /><br />Overall, anyone looking for this film should probably wait to see if it is going to be re-released. I think current owners should get a free upgrade to a better quality if that's ever released (which I doubt it will happen).
B001EO748M|5.0|Was there ever in all of European a royal House half so bloodstained, globally significant, or interesting as that ethnically Welsh clan known as the Tudors? Were the Bourbons? The Romanovs? Scoff. Amateurs. People have been talking, writing and reading about this bunch for half a millennium and the fascination doesn't seem endangered. I'll say it again, what this series sacrifices in historical accuracy and authentic-to-life casting, it more than makes up for in sheer watchability thanks to our \\"Buff\\" (as opposed to Bluff) King Hal and his band of oft-ill-fated extras.<br /><br />The Tudors---The Complete Second Season was darker, less fun, more dramatic and edge of your seat than season one ever was. Jonathan Rhys Meyers' Henry VIII was meaner and more hypertensed than when last we saw him, with youthful handsomeness traded for ruddy-faced unhealthiness and growing megalomania. The production values here in these ten episodes may even have surpassed those of the first season, and Thomas More's quiet and protracted path to the executioner's block simply stole the series and overshadowed the heartrending final days of the much-betrayed Anne Bolelyn.<br /><br />The DVD extras for this second season were excellent, with the best of all being Natalie Dormer's visit to the real life sites of the imprisonment, execution, and entombment of the queen she portrayed. As she put it, \\"I'm having a moment here...\\" I think we all did.<br /><br />Season three, I can't wait to meet you!
1594489505|4.0|The writer tells his story in a very direct and precise way, his language is simple but catching.<br />It is a story of oppression,tyranny,abuse and brutality.A country torn by different wars and upheavals, where nobody really knows what will happen tomorrow or if there will be one.The novel paints the lives of two women thrown together by faith ready to become arch-enemies, who's resistance to their common brutal husband will create a deep friendship and help them to survive. These women are real. During my visits to Peshawar and Kandahar I encountered these shadows in burqa,slipping by noiselesly trying to become invisible ,only the shimmer of their dark afraid eyes sometimes showing through the perforated part of their thick veils.Hundreds of them,in dark bleu,black or grey, pathetic figures, ghosts with little sad children clinging to their legs or hands, victims all of customs of a different age.The Taliban have made the situation worse and converted this beautiful country into a land without music,dance,art,learning and most of all without the smile or laughter of women.A phalocratic regime where women are only tolerated because of their ability to bear children.<br />All this is expressed in this book, yes it is a sad read but also the pure thruth.
B000THGPTE|3.0|Jethro Tull over the years has made many great albums. I dont need to go down the list.  Too old to Rock and Roll is a very average release.  To me the highlight is: Salamander. Salamander in my mind is probably their finest acoustic song of their career. Ian Anderson really came up with a great song, it is simply a masterpiece.  The rest of the CD is worth listening to, but not their best by any means.  Salamander alone is worth the purchase.
B00260HH3K|3.0|Normally, I don't change my opinion of a film. But in this case, I had to revise my opinion of DB, rather drastically.<br /><br />  Overall, Dragonball: Evolution is a schizophrenic film. On some levels, it captures the essence of the original Dragonball; on other levels, it's completely wrong.<br /><br />  One oddity early in the development of the movie was that the released trailers actually made it look WORSE than it was -- in rather blatant contradiction to the normal approach where you try to make things look better than they are. The trailer led one to believe a number of things that simply weren't true (i.e., things that had, in fact, NOT been changed from the original were made to appear completely different). Why this was, I don't know. It's POSSIBLE the intent was to achieve the effect of making the viewer pleasantly surprised and thus view the movie more positively after the fact, but it seems a very risky method, and one that clearly didn't work well given that Dragonball:Evolution didn't make buttloads of money.<br /><br />Spoilers follow, so don't read farther if you don't want to know!<br /><br />The essence of Dragonball was preserved in some ways. It takes place on a version of Dragonworld -- it may be called Earth (\\"Chikyuu\\"), but it's Dragonworld. We have Capsules, and bizarre technology, wierd mixes of cultures... it LOOKS like a Toriyama world, made real, in many ways. On the other hand, much of the early imagery and culture looked too much like our own.<br /><br />As I rather expected, they fused Gohan and Goku in terms of personality. This actually works well in that it allows us to introduce Goku in an at least somewhat familiar setting.<br /><br />(Worries about him being a loser being beaten up... no, he's not. He has been made fun of, but it's not because he CAN'T fight...)<br /><br />Chatwin, I'm happy to say, does this version of Goku well. He gets the innocence and awkwardness of the Gohan aspects, and when the time comes to be more \\"Goku\\", he shows it perfectly. Okay, his hair isn't nine inches high, but it's spiky in a very Saiyajin way.<br /><br />Rossum *IS* Bulma. Yes, they've given her some action sequences, but I think that improves her character in context.<br /><br />Chow Yun Fat was, as I said earlier, the RIGHT choice for Mutenroshi/Kamesenin. They toned down his Ecchi nature, leaving just enough of the dirty old man to keep him the same somewhat, er, earthy character.<br /><br />James Marsters was, in fact, the PERFECT Piccolo. He sounded like Piccolo, he moved like Piccolo, and yes, he was very much GREEN like Piccolo Daimao. This was quite a surprise, given my early impressions.<br /><br />  The casting, thus, was some of the good material in this movie. The plotline IN OUTLINE is pretty much standard Dragonball. The overall script, however, just doesn't quite manage it. There are clever pieces... but they don't quite hang together. The spirit's there, but it's not allowed all the way OUT.<br /><br />Oh, one of the lies told in the previews? The mystics who banded together did NOT create the Dragonballs. They invented the Maa Fubaaa, a technique an awful lot of DB fans forget about, to capture and imprison Piccolo. The Dragonballs are, in fact, what they were always supposed to be, and the Great Dragon Shen-Long DOES make an appearance.<br /><br />The music's pretty good, too.<br /><br />Again, that's some of the good points, but the other pieces didn't quite gel. It seemed almost as though there was an argument or conflict with both the script and acting/directing as to \\"how far\\" to go, how much of the original to keep, and how to do it. One of the characteristics of Dragonball/DBZ is the *SCALE* of conflict, and they just didn't quite get to the level you need to in the final battle.<br /><br />So in short, it's worth viewing, but it doesn't, alas, manage to give the pure adaptation we could have hoped for.s hair isn't nine inches high, but it's spiky in a very Saiyajin way.

Why listen to some guy talk about running on and on - he's not giving any advice about being a better runner, as he clearly states - unless you already were a fan?<br /><br />The book is basically Murakami ruminating about running, telling personal history, letting us follow him as he trains for the New York marathon, as well as other races.<br /><br />When I started reading What I Talk About, it made me really happy. I thought \\"wow, this is a guy who thinks a lot like I do,\\" and found a lot of sentences that I wanted to read to my friends because he stated something about life in a fresh interesting way that felt really true and elucidating, like something I knew but hadn't been able to put my finger on before.<br /><br />Then I didn't read the book for many months (because I loaned it to my friend and she lost it for a while, if you have to know), and when I came back, I had a different reaction. It was still interesting and I definitely looked forward to reading it. But it mostly felt like some guy just talking - talk talk talk - the sort of talk we do when we talk every day to someone with whom we're comfortable. We have run out of sweeping and profound observations, by and large, and mostly cover the day to day details. Which is great - day to day details need loving attention too, just as much as big profound ideas. And since I'm a fan of Murakami, it was okay by me to hear about his daily details.<br /><br />Murakami is an interesting guy. He is droll and sort of weird. But he's not very self-conscious about being weird, even though he does think about himself a lot. I'll admit, my impression of him is shaped by the characters in his books; several protagonists seem a lot like him. He has a quality of someone who submits to fate - and I'm somebody who finds the fatalistic outlook very compelling - even as he has this strong sense of shaping what he does. For example, he find himself to be a long-distance runner - there it is, he is one, and he sort of shrugs and doesn't question why a lot. But now that that's established, he is intricately involved with how to be a good long-distance runner, at least by the standard of his own potential, how to drive his body to its peak.<br /><br />I'm not a runner. I've never been able to run more than a mile, even though I worked at it for a year once. But I'd like to be, at least to break a mile sometime. So that part of the book is a little interesting to me. But I have to say here that Murakami can drive me crazy with the running stuff. He says he's not such a great runner, which I guess is true if you're in this rarified runners' world with lots of people doing marathons. He may just be a guy in the pack, and it is sort of nice that he's not a show-off. But what Murakami does as a runner is really quite extraordinary when you compare it with the real pack, all of us reader-people out here, probably more than half of which can't run over a mile. Get this, Murakami runs a 26.2 mile marathon every year, and once ran a super-marathon of 62 miles. So I find his humble-pie a little irritating, even if it's genuine.<br /><br />What is most vivid and useful is when Murakami shows how he uses this runner's outlook and discipline in his novel writing. He talks about how it is crucial to develop focus and stamina, as both a runner and a novelist, and describes his own writing work schedule. After all, novel writing is sort of like long-distance running.<br /><br />I found few great revelations in this book, but it was definitely alluring. In one anecdote, Murakami tells how he wanted to talk to John Irving because he was translating one of Irvings's books. Irving told him that he was too busy, but that Murakami could come jog with him and they could talk then. Not the best way to interview an author, but that's what Murakami got, and he seemed to relishthe experience. That's what this book is like. We get to hang out and hear Murakami talk about this and that, but only if we run with him.

1596434252|1.0|This was given to our son for his 1st birthday.  If I actually let him near the book he would destroy it in seconds as the paper that the pop-ups are made of is quite flimsy.  Totally inappropriate for young children.  Whenever kids know how to be very gentle - then they'd be OK with this book, though I still would not recommend it.  I only tried to open a few pages and often the way one letter is supposed to morph into another either did not glide well or was hard to even figure out which letters they were supposed to be.
0743486285|5.0|Book arrived in a timely manner and in great condition. The story itself is twisted, scary and warped. It does however, offer a glimpse into the rock n roll world's affair with drugs, alcohol and loss of reality with fame.
B001E0FRD0|1.0|This is an incredible event, no doubt. The shear will to survive, the courage it took, the situation itself, are all unimaginable.    The book, however, is hypocritical and-worst of all-poorly written.    The characters are thinly detailed, and we never get to know the real men behind the story. Every one of them was \\"great.\\" This word is repeated so many times it loses any effect after the first chapter. Other than that, we are not told much about individual SEALs, nothing to make them seem real and breathing. Sure, one is surfer (dude!) and one does yoga (isn't that silly-but he was still great of course), and we are told there a couple of smart allecks (but we are never given any smart quips). In fact, we are not shown anything. It is all tell, and each SEAL is reduced to his one word trait and cliche (yogi, surfer smart alleck etc)    The hypocritical part is obvious: according to Luttrell they should have murder the sheep herders. That was why his team mates died. And it was all the fault of the \\"liberal media.\\"    Luttrell defends this by saying it wouldn't have been murder because they were at war-and you should have seen how the sheep herders looked back at them anyway, with real hatred and stupidity. They deserved to die.    The hypocrisy is that this same attitude was what drove the 9/11 terrorists. They believed they were at war and we deserved to die. Its one sided, and just leads to more violence.    Also, how knows if it was the sheep herders that turned them in? Because, if a flock of sheep \\"snuck\\" up behind the team, who's to say the Taliban didn't?    Later, as Luttrell is recovering in the Afghan village and hiding from the Taliban, he gets to know the doctor who saved him. Although he tries to say he respected the man, and was appreciative for this man and his village actually saving his life, the doctor and other villagers are primarily depicted as dirty and downright primitive. The one thing that comes through the writing is that Luttrell reallylooks down upon and despises these people. Additionally its the liberal media fault (this point is preached about to no end, but the arguments are-at best-thin)    The story of a man, who leaves Texas, survives an awful encounter withe the enemy, but then needs to re-evaluate his prejudices in lite of the kindness of the villagers and the risks they took to protect him, is completely overwritten by patriotic jingo and somewhat religious rhetoric.     The first half of the book is spent depicting SEAL training. Although it is intense and grueling, it really just serves as SEAL ego building. It doesn't advance the story, and what could have been a great opportunity to introduce and grow with each SEAL is totally lost. This would have made a great prologue.     Even the story of his family at home, supposed to pull at your heart strings (it does) from a narrative perspective is completely out of place and breaks what little flow the others had developed in telling the story. It would of made for a great epilogue.    The real meat of the story is poorly written and shows considerable prejudice and some down-right ignorance. Not to take anything away from the man, what he survived or the Navy Seals in general, but this is a terrible book. It should have been written by an investigative reporter, someone who given life to the fallen heroes and found the story at the heart of the situation. Sebastian Junger, were you not available?

B0019CSXAM|5.0|Usually, there is a risk with shows that start really great with their first season. The characters have the risk of making the same jokes and the story keeps giving you the same lines. Not with the season 3 of How I Met Your Mother. In Season 3, you'll get to see the struggles of a married Marshall & Lily, a whole new chapter for two characters and new jokes, Robin coming back with Gael (Enrique Iglesias) and the jokes surrounding it and Barney's relation with Abby (Britney Spears) alone would make it a reason enough to get this one. (By the way, Britney's role playing is pretty good, I was prejudiced at first but think she's done great). The guys of How I Met Your Mother have created a great show and the third season is another proof. Highly recommended.

B000YENUI6|5.0|It's now 2009, and you would think that we would learn from our mistakes when it comes to bad movies . . . uh-huh. These past years, we've been tortured by three family-friendly High School Musical films, poor comedies like The Love Guru, teenage garbage such as 13 Going on 30, sappy fantasies like Eragon, etc. But hey, at least many of the action films were good to watch. Even though I'm in my early 20's, I'm a bit saddened that today's generation has ignored many classic films such as The Godfather and 2001: A Space Odyssey. And come on, The Dark Knight is a great movie and all, but it shouldn't be the ONLY film to watch in your lifetime! However, there is still hope. We have seen excellent movies from 2000 to present. No Country for Old Men, Donnie Darko, Hot Fuzz and Letters from Iwo Jima are just a few. One of them I particularly enjoyed watching straight through is Eastern Promises. It's not only one of the few films in this generation that's strictly for ADULTS, but it's also one of the two darkest and most violent thrillers of 2007 (right next to No Country For Old Men).<br /><br />This film starring Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts is a relief from all the politically correct films we've seen for some time. There are some downright disturbing stuff going on. Anna Khitrova (Watts), who works at a hospital, has been informed that a fourteen-year old girl has just died of childbirth. She finds the girl's diary and discovers the painful truth: the girl named Tatiana was part of a notorious Russian prostitution ring, and that the ones who are partly responsible are right here in London. Mortensen, Vincent Cassel, and Armin Mueller-Stahl play the \\"thieves in law\\" who try to make sure that the truth is never revealed to the authorities.<br /><br />And it's not only the plot that's disturbing. There are scenes in which blood and gore takes center stage (the infamous bathhouse scene, for example). And there are plenty of major plot twists (if you want to know what they are, then watch the film). Mortensen was perfectly cast as Nikolai. He avoids the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" typecasting and goes on to act with a very good Russian accent. Watts gives a lovely performance as Anna; I could see no one else playing the part. Cassel as Kiril looks to be someone you would love to hate at first, but when the film nears its end, you can't really tell if you really do. Mueller-Stahl as Semyon is definitely the one we would love to hate, and he does a hell of a job at that. The supporting cast have it down good, also, so no complaints here.<br /><br />The reason I watched Eastern Promises was because I have a deep interest in Russian history, culture, and mythology. This clearly exceeded my expectations. It's one of the best films of 2007. It's too bad, though, that some people of this generation won't be very pleased when they get a chance to see this, because it's so dark and disturbing. Well, it's safe to say that I admire the film, and I hope there will be another film this year that will be as stupendous as this one.<br /><br />Grade: A+atch the film).

B000001IPP|5.0|Having been a long-time fan of the seminal East Bay punk band, Rancid; I am completely happy with Let's Go. As a musician who is always on the look out for new or talented acts, Rancid don't have to impress me twice. I especially like the tracks<br /><br />1. Nihilism- 5/5- This song is raw, edgy and Lars vocals are complimented by lead singer Tim  Armstrong's growly snarl.<br /><br />2. Radio- 5/5- Co written by Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day (no relation to lead singer Tim Armstrong) this song discusses things that every young punk can relate to growing up. Sort of reminds me of a romantic song in a twisted way.<br /><br />3. Side Kick- 3/5: Sort of a super hero type song. Not my least favorite but not my favorite either<br /><br />4. Salvation- 5/5: Such a sexy, raw song. I remember being a teen and always having this song stuck in my head.<br /><br />5. Tenderloin- 5/5: A catchy tune that is seemingly about a woman (which many Rancid songs aren't about) nice version played pit at the Rancid show here last year :)<br /><br />6. Let's Go- 1/5: An annoying song that seems like a filler. Why they chose this as their title track I haven't a clue. Skip this track<br /><br />7. As One- 1/5: Boring, skip this track.<br /><br />8. Burn- 2/5: Catchy tune, but the lyrics are bit profanity laced for my tastes.<br /><br />9. The Ballad of Jimmy and Johnny: 1/5- Another skipped track<br /><br />10. Gunshot: 3/5- Filler song, skipped track to me. Sounds like bassist Matt Freeman on vocals. Like the guitar interlude though. I can do some mad skanking to this song.<br /><br />11. I am the One: 1/5: Skipped track<br /><br />12. Gave it Away: 1/5: Another filler, there are alot on this record!<br /><br />13. Ghetto Box: 4/5: Fast and rough, great song.<br /><br />14. Harry Bridges: 1/5: Boring, no clear basis<br /><br />15. Black and Blue: 1/5: I don't like this song at all. Matt Freeman sings again, it appears. Matt is an incredible, talented bassist but vocals are not his calling.<br /><br />16. St. Mary: 1/5: Skip<br /><br />17. Dope Sick Girl: 5/5- Man, this song is catchy. Its funny too. Love it!<br /><br />18. International Cover Up: 2/5- I can take or leave this song.<br /><br />19. Solidarity: 1/5- Boring, lack of clear structure. Filler, again.<br /><br />20. Midnight: 5/5- Love this song. Makes me want to get up and dance in some way, shape, or form.<br /><br />21. Motorcycle Ride: 5/5- Clear structure, great progression in chords and formulation. Punk rock at its finest, I don't care what the 12 year old kids say today. This is raw punk power.<br /><br />22. Name: 4/5- I like how Tim screams \\"you don't know my name!\\" in the beginning.

B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Wolfgang Peterson, wrote and directed this superb film of submarine life during World War II. When first seen by an American audience, reactions were mixed. Halfway into the film, the German crew begins to exhibit some universal traits which touch the heart of anyone fighting for a cause. Gone is the reason why the seamen are fighting often-times an unseen enemy. The reasons are replaced by a plethora of dangerous and certainly dramatic events which allow an audience to see the life and death struggle of all veterans. The visual heart of this unusual movie, is that of an experienced German Captain (Jürgen Prochnow) who sails the Atlantic, meeting both friend and foe alike. With him are his aids, Lt. Henrich (Lehmann-Willenbrock), Herbert Grönemeyer as Lt. Werner and Klaus Wennemann who is superior as Chief Engineer. When they realize the war is nearly over, they head for home. Unfortunately they are spotted, targeted and attacked by the English navy. Now comes some heart-pounding action as most of the crew expect to die before reaching home. Seen from the perspective of an American audience, one expects the inevitable. Yet, from the audience point of view, one can not help but sympathize for the Captain and his valiant crew. A Great film indeed. ****
B001DWNUCO|4.0|My title say's it all. But I think the the movie is worth having a look at! It is hard to believe this is how life was once unless you see it with your own eyes.
B001VPJZDG|4.0|This movie not only tells a great story that makes us think, there are many very funny parts.  Plus, it is based on a true story so you realize just how much impact someone can have if they work hard and don't give up when things get tough.  Erin Brockovich made a difference in many people's lives - lives that had been seriously damaged - yet she also made a difference in our society as big businesses got the message that they can't just hurt people without paying a price for that.    Entertaining movie, powerful points made, yet with humor delicately intertwined throughout the movie.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|\\"The Reader,\\" based on the book of the same name by German author Bernard Schlink, tells the story of an affair between a middle-aged trolley-car worker (Hanna Schmitz, played by Kate Winslet) and a teen boy (Michael Berg, played by David Kross) in 1958.  The affair is odd, with Hanna insisting that the boy read classic literature to her before they make love.  They don't even know each other's names initially.  After several months together, the boy finds Hanna's apartment empty one day, and he does not see her again for 8 years when he is in law school.  Despite the briefness of the affair, it has a profound effect on the boy.<br /><br />I read the book, \\"The Reader,\\" about 10 years ago, shortly after it was released, and the movie is more or less faithful to it.  Some audiences are going to avoid \\"The Reader.\\"  For example, some viewers are bound to be offended by an affair between a woman in her 30s and a 15 year old boy.  Indeed, these scenes are rather graphic, including full frontal female and male nudity (director Stephen Daldry had to hold off filming these scenes until the end of filming when David Kross turned 18 years old).  Likewise, some people probably think that \\"The Reader\\" is just another dreary Holocaust movie.  However, they're going to miss a worthwhile movie.  First, neither the affair nor the Holocaust is the core of the movie; instead the focus is on post-WWII German guilt.  The affair basically is a plot device to illustrate the generation gap in how Germans viewed what occurred during the Holocaust.  Second, no scenes depict Holocaust events, although there is some brief emotional trial testimony.  Certainly \\"The Reader\\" is an emotion-laden movie, but it does not show explicit violence like \\"Schindler's List.\\"<br /><br />For interested viewers, there's much to appreciate in this film.  Kate Winslet is spectacular and deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actress.  She also won a slew of Supporting Actress awards for the part, including the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild (she was marketed as supporting actress so it wouldn't compete with her leading role in \\"Revolutionary Road\\").  Her part perhaps is smaller than David Kross' role, but she is definitely the leading actress here.  The makeup artists (who get their own mini-documentary on the DVD extras) also merit attention, as they age Kate quite believably across 40 years.  Ralph Fiennes also does solid work as the older version of Michael Berg; he really had a great 2008, with terrific turns in \\"The Duchess\\" and \\"In Bruges.\\"  He really should have gotten more love during awards season, especially for \\"In Bruges.\\"  Finally, David Kross is perfectly cast as the teen Michael.  Kross is German and had to learn English for the role; he more than holds his own against the luminous Winslet.<br /><br />Another major strength is the movie's spare script, which prevents the audience from an easy resolution.  \\"The Reader\\" never directly tells us what we should think about Hanna - never moralizes.  As Kate Winslet explains on one of the documentaries on the DVD extras, the movie doesn't ask the audience to sympathize with Hanna.  However, the movie does not demonize her, instead maintaining enough gray areas to force the audience to think critically about their response.  I appreciated this approach even more after viewing some of the deleted scenes which tended to overexplain situations and lead the viewers in certain directions.  Despite these strengths, \\"The Reader\\" is flawed.  The movie unfolds a bit too leisurely.  In addition, by making Hanna an enigma, it distances the audience and prevents an emotional catharsis.

As far as the story, it was very sad that it had to end. I could keep listening to this story forever! Very well written, and if you are a book reader, I think the audio versions are the way to go because you can actually hear the emotion in the characters which really gets you more involved in the lives of the characters, you feel a connection. Overall, a wonderful story, an emotional roller coaster ride, and a beautiful love story.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|This is an amazing album by Taylor. She wrote most of the songs by herself, has a beautiful voice and is defenately worth buying and listening to over, and over, and over again.    Now that the Fearless Platinum Edition is out, I recomend you should buy that one. It includes 6 new songs and a dvd. The inside of the cd pamphlet is the same for both, except the platinum edition pamphlet also has new pictures and new lyrics.    Only considering the original Fearless cd, my favorite tracks are:  You Belong With Me  Tell Me Why  Forever and Always  The Way I Loved You (my all time favorite)

B0013D6LEM|5.0|We all know the statistics. However many tens of millions sold, Thriller remains the most successful album of all time. Seven of the nine tracks were released as singles; all of them reached the top 10. The mythic level of success Thriller has achieved is a big part of what makes it so special, but the music is good enough to stand on its own. \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" are claustrophobic in their paranoia but undeniably danceable with unusual, infectious rhythms. \\"Beat It\\" gets a blistering guitar solo from Eddie Van Halen that compliments Michael's insistent, even frightening vocals. \\"Human Nature\\" is a gorgeous, transcendent ballad with mysterious lyrics and bittersweet harmonies. Fans of Off the Wall will especially enjoy the disco flavor of \\"Baby be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T.\\" Even the weaker songs, like the ubiquitous title track and the pop-cheese of \\"The Girl is Mine,\\" are immaculate. Michael Jackson sounded like no one else in 1982, but 27 years after Thriller everyone is trying to sound like Michael Jackson. 5 Stars.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I can understand why this film was selected as the best film of 2008. It is at the same time harsh and heartwarming. The scenes in the slums of Bombay are such a contrast from what most of us in the United States are used to that they are hard to watch without wanting to do something to help those poor children. What a hellish world those children and adults have to live in everyday. The performance by Dev Patel was outstanding as the young man who grew up in the slums and then triumphed on the TV quiz show.
B001P9KR8U|3.0|I would not have chosen this movie to view. Having said that, I'm glad a close friend did choose it for us to view together as I was very pleasantly surprised. I liked the story, the way flashbacks explained the events taking place, the way in which it was filmed, and the believability of the characters. I found it entertaining, and although another viewer mentioned scenes of torture I don't feel anything was blatantly overdone. This is a work of fiction, and I like happy endings too.

I'm 61 and would consider getting a portrait of my deceased son from her, and I am a non-tatooed female.
B00007LTIA|5.0|All the 2003 remasters of Yes albums have amazing sound quality, sounds like they might have been recorded yesterday in a state of the art studio. This is maybe the best remastering of music from the sixties and seventies I've ever heard, should be a benchmark for all remastering engineers to strive for. That combined with the low list price for these albums makes them a must-buy for even the casual listener.

B001PPLIFU|3.0|If you were like me and you were surprised on how great Casino Royale was compared to the Typical cartoonish James Bond movies. You will be a bit dissapointed in Quantum of Solace.   WHile this movie tried to leave off exactly where Casino Royale ended it did not have the tone or feel with this follow up. I was hoping for something that would continue with the 5 star Epic that was Casio Royale.   I was left wanting. You never really knew who was who in this film. Character development was really lacking. Directing was all over the place. I feel bad, they really could have hit this film out of the park. Daniel Craig was spectacular in Casino Royale. This film is felt like he mailed it in. Total Auto Pilot. 3 Stars. Only because it actually tried to wrap up the story from the Previous film.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|All I can say is \\"Oh My!\\" I am a married, working mother of a 3 year old. I also HATE to read books. I never have been one for reading, but I have to admit that after I watched the movie. I WAS HOOKED! I read Twilight in a little over 12 hours. I could not put it down. I then read the other three in less than a week. I loved the first three, but Breaking Dawn did not hold my attention like the others. Don't get me wrong, it was a good book, but no where near as captivating as the others. I have watched the movie countless times and agree with what most people say about books vs. movies. The book was better than the movie, but the deleted scenes are in the book. I think that the movies need to come out quicker, a year is too long to have to wait between movies. (The Harry Potter movies came out quicker, I think) Not sure, but maybe they will get Eclipse out before November 2010. Can't wait! Another thing I noticed about the books is that I can not understand how these are for teenage girls.

It's her best album since Jagged, and I hate to even use them in the same sentence because you just can't compare the two.  They are totally different.  Where Jagged is more angry, Flavors is more contemplative.<br /><br />I'm so glad I bought this album!

B001IAOEXU|5.0|I initially hesitated purchasing this item. However, after having used them for a while, i am extremely happy with my purchase. I tend to play for longer sessions(2-4 hrs)and these RealTrigger trigger extensions come in extremely handy. As all you gamers know, your fingers can get a little sweaty and tired during intense, long play sessions and the Playstation controller's stock R2 and L2 triggers slope downward on the back...further aggravating the situation. Simple solution, just snapon the RealTriggers and no more slipping off the L2 and R2 triggers during those intense shootouts. Worth the price, great purchase.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|This movie is one of the best independent foreign film i have seen!  I love vampire films and this film is great! Unlike other vampire films, it's not filled with the cliche vampire style. It is more of a young love, or more a friendship, story. I highly recommend this film...if you don't mind subtitles (although u can change the language, but its better in subtitles).
0312360266|2.0|Subtract the parenthesis, the poor grammar, and the stereotypical valley girl speech, and it makes for a \\"decent\\" story line that could leave much to be desired.    The plot and conflicts get clouded with the \\"teen\\" language and parenthesis (oh my god!) and it makes for a difficult read.  The sexual scenarios in this book make it very disturbing that it is in fact for young adults, and when I say that, I mean young girls.    With the young girls that are caught up in the Twilight fanatics (I am an avid Stephenie Meyer reader), this series is something to worry about.  It should not be a reading material for girls under the age of 18 in my opinion.  Young girls, as disturbing as it may be, look up to the writings of Stephenie Meyer, as an example, and rest their morals on these sorts of books.  It disappoints me that something this distasteful will be next on their agenda, and it leaves the wrong message to what girls should behave like.    The makeshift plot disappointed me, reminding me of a mix between the Twilight Saga and Harry Potter; throw a little blood into the mix, a separate school for \\"unique\\" teenagers to wield their powers properly, and you have a Meyer/Rowling pie.    The fact alone that a mother and daughter wrote this series together also worried me, especially for the over exaggerated \\"teen\\" slang, the raunchy sexual scenarios, the trendy product placement into the book (i.e, Toby Keith, Dillards, etc), and not to mention the constant religious bashing... Simply put, the writing puts the reader off, and it makes me wonder how a mother and daughter are comfortable writing such vulgarity together with full knowledge that little girls (and I'm talking at least 10 years of age), will be reading this, and looking up to it?  That is what disturbs me the most.

1603420398|5.0|Simply, I liked having a wealth of non-traditional motif patterns so that aren't found in other places.    That said, this book delivers on just that.    The only thing I would have changed is to have had a few motifs created with thread or very fine yarn just to show how different it would look for those interested in making items with thread, and perhaps to include more Irish inspired motifs (or Romanian and Japanese for those interested in it).    End.
B00005JPY2|4.0|If anything were ever impossible to translate to film, it's Watchmen. To think a screenplay by a sub-par writer directed by a stylish but over-the-top director would achieve this translation with any modicum of success is mindblowing if you're anywhere near as cynical as i am. This is a surprisingly good movie and if you have any interest in seeing it, you should (and since this review contains spoilers, you should have already seen it). However, there's a few bruises on this pretty face, the majority of which are superficial, but at least one has lead to severe brain damage under the surface. I'm of course referring to the ending, but clearly I'm getting ahead of myself.    The acting in this movie simply must be praised. Rorshack's portrayal is eerily perfect and makes the movie. They could have cut every scene he wasn't in and called this Rorshack: The Movie and it'd still be a masterpiece. Most of the other actors are nearly as good, especially Dan/Nite Owl's. Silk Spectre doesn't come across as particularly captivating, but i was never especially blown away by her character in the graphic novel, so that's a wash. Adrian Viedt is the only casualty in the cast. His portrayal is a slap in the face to anyone who liked his character in the graphic novel. Probably to give the movie a tangible foe closer to Rorshack's black-and-white view of the world and farther from the comic's shades-of-gray theme, Viedt is arrogant from the beginning and a total bastard by the end. Part of me suspects his new German accent, which he hides from the public but uses around the heroes he ends up antagonizing, is supposed to make him seem more malicious, maybe even foreshadowing his killing of, let's say, 6 million innocent people (as opposed to the half million or so he kills in the comic). Perhaps worst of all, his cat Bubastis is cut out of all the scenes in which it establishes Viedt as having a loving attachment to another creature, but it shows up without any reason or explanation for the scene in which Viedt kills it. There is some effort made to earn him some sympathy, but i can't imagine anyone walking away from this movie seeing Viedt as anything but a monster, and that's just wrong.    The fight scene in the alleyway with our \\"heroes\\" pointlessly brutalizing the street thugs who attacked them is gut-wrenching, not because the violence is way, WAY over the top, but because it's entirely pointless, given too much focus for too long, and has those involved acting entirely out-of-character. The soundtrack ranges from cool and poignant to glaringly out-of-place and silly. Renaming the Crimebusters the Watchmen is just tacky and insulting to the viewer, not to mention changes the title from clever and deep to typical Hollywood trash. This nitpicking, however, is inconsequential compared to movie's ending, which fills me with woe. If an entity America claims responsibility for attacks the entire world, wouldn't the immediate response be to destroy America, not declare a truce with them? How do they intend to fight a being who single-handedly won the Vietnam War in a week and, they believe, nuked a bunch of major cities simultaneously as some kind of \\"warning\\"? What happens when they realize their enemy has left Earth forever (which would be almost immediately, since he was well-known to be on the verge of doing so anyway)? The more you think about it, the less sense it makes, ultimately becoming utter gibberish, unlike the original ending, which gradually makes more sense as you contemplate it.    Nevertheless, this movie is great, and a miracle considering the source material and the people responsible for it. It just has to be said that it doesn't hold a candle to the graphic novel (except to burn out the last chapter and hastily replace it with crude scribbles and nonsense).
1416584072|4.0|Brick Lane's protagonist, Nazneen, is a survivor. She came into the world prematurely in 1967, and was thought to be stillborn. She did not breath. Suddenly, the infant surprised her mother and aunt by beginning to howl with life. Rupan, Nazneen's mother, refused to assist the baby in growing stronger. She was adamant, \\"let fate take its course.\\" \\"My child must not waste any energy fighting against fate. That way she will be stronger.\\" In her East Pakistan village of Gouripur, (back then Bangladesh was East Pakistan), Nazneen frequently heard the story of \\"How You Were Left To Your Fate.\\" The girl bought into her mother's beliefs that she must accept the Grace of God, for \\"what cannot be changed must be borne.\\" Women play a secondary role in society and must be dutiful and obedient to survive a life filled with unpredictable happenstance. Hasina, Nazneen's beloved sister, is beautiful, strong-willed and does not believe any of her mother's philosophies about a woman's place. Unlike Nazeen, who is stoic and fatalistic, Hasina rebels against adversity and tradition.<br /><br />At age eighteen, Nazneen is thrust into an arranged marriage with a man old enough to be her father. She passively accepts her family's wishes. Her husband, Chanu Ahmed, is fat and balding, but an educated man who lives in London...\\"the place where rich and successful emigrants make their place,\\" explains her father.<br /><br />She is transported to a tiny, cluttered flat in London's Tower Hamlets, a Bengali Muslim enclave. Husband Chanu may be literate, but he is also a pompous lout, seemingly oblivious to the realities of everyday life and devoid of social graces. He appears to have no common sense, but does possess an enormously inflated ego. He thinks of himself as a frustrated intellectual. Nazreen endures, remembering her mother's words, \\"If G-d wanted us to ask questions, he would have made us men.\\" Her life, at first, is confined, no shopping and no going outside alone. She speaks little English, and what she does see of British culture bewilders her. Her female neighbors are supportive but they also spy on one another.<br /><br />With time, and the birth of two daughters, Nazneen learns to be more accepting of her husband. The older daughter, Shahana, is a rebellious adolescent, who acts-out and wishes their lives were more Westernized. The pre-teen vents her anger against Bengali Muslim traditions and longs to assimilate into British culture. Nazneen also bore and lost a son when he was a mere baby, and this is a constant source of sadness for her.<br /><br />Her relationship with her husband is complex, as he is a much more complicated man than originally described. The author develops both characters brilliantly, and demonstrates their growth and their burgeoning mutual affection. Yes, Chanu is a bumbler, who loses job after job, and comes up with ridiculous schemes to make money, borrowing from a notorious load shark. However, he displays genuine affection for his wife and possesses a gentle humor. One feels pity for his failures, crushed hopes and the gradual awareness of his own shortcomings.<br /><br />For many years, Nazneen's only real pleasure is corresponding with her sister, who has not followed the path of duty and obedience. Hasina struck out on her own, married for love, and now lives in Dhaka where she struggles to eke out a living as a factory worker. Her life is full of disappointments, and her love-match is the biggest disappointment of all. Nazneen struggles to send her sister money and dreams of the day when she can bring her to London.<br /><br />One of her neighbors, and dear friend, Razia Iqbal, is a forward-thinking, independent woman who sews at home for a living. She encourages Nazneen to buy a sewing machine and get work. A financial crisis motivates Chanu to allow his wife to buy the machine and get a job doing piecework, finishing blue jeans. Thus, a new door to life opens for the lonely woman, and also introduces herto Karim, a man who picks-up and delivers the sewing. He is young, handsome and confident, an active leader in community politics. Disaffected Bengali youth from the neighborhood, who try to assimilate but remain adrift in a world where Anglo drug sellers infiltrate the housing development, look up to Karim. He longs to bring these young people back to more traditional values. As his relationship with Nazneen intensifies, she begins to question her philosophy of life and challenge the status quo.<br /><br />I so enjoyed reading \\"Brick Lane.\\" Monica Ali's writing is wonderful. She constructs and developes her characters carefully and believably, especially Nazreen, Chanu and Karim, as well as the novel's interesting minor figures. They change and grow continuously, gaining in depth, throughout this multi-layered novel. The relationship between Nazneen and Karim is also one of many complexities, which the author explores most thoroughly. She also examines the political environment during the time period when the story takes place. One can actually feel the tensions within the community as the residents witness and react to the Oldham Riots and 9/11. I was especially fascinated by the community political meetings, where members discuss global jihad and local injustices. Monica Ali possesses a light, comic touch which prevents the storylines from becoming too heavy. This is most apparent with Nazneen's inner dialogue. I recommend this novel highly.<br />Jana Perskie<br /><br />[[ASIN:0812979656 The God of Small Things: A Novel]]<br />[[ASIN:0006513255 Of Marriageable Age]]<br />[[ASIN:0061493856 The Writing on My Forehead: A Novel]]<br />[[ASIN:0156029731 Kartography]]<br />[[ASIN:0312286236 Bombay Time: A Novel]]<br />[[ASIN:0449909662 Holder of the World]]ewing.

B000RZIGVS|4.0|This is one of my absolute favorite TV shows from when I was a kid, and even as an adult I am just in love with all the characters.  The stories are some of the best ever conceived. The special effects still hold up very well 20 years beyond the series finale.     The only reason that I rated this four stars instead of 5 stars is the terrible packaging.  The package looks good, but, the system that is used is horrible and was broken in three places when it arrived at my door before I even looked at a DVD.  There is a very thin piece of plastic that connects each section of the DVD's together.  The DVD's come out as one giant insert and so it is hard to get to just one out without damaging the case.  I would have sent it back, but, in truth, I really just want to be able to watch the show.  Also, if I send it back I know that I will just get the exact same thing, and given what I know, it would brake too (Plus I didn't get it from Amazon so I can't exchange it :)).    Other than the case, this is an excellent collection for the price.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|The Dark Knight isn't your average superhero movie. It has little of the fantasy one often associates with such movies and instead creates an action thriller that has both your heart and mind racing to the finish. It's a movie that you have to watch several times to truly get everything out of. Everything is so thought-out and so intricate that a moment of unawareness from the viewer means they miss the connection later on. It's a smart film meant for smart people. While I quite miss the fantasy-aspect of previous Batman films (this even includes Batman Begins), this is undeniably a thrilling watch.<br /><br />Batman and Gordon attract the assistance of DA Harvey Dent to bring down the Gotham Mafia by cutting off their funds. Just as it looks like their plan is about to succeed, it's turned on itself by the mysterious Joker, an unhinged yet charismatic crook who single-handedly manages to push Gotham towards complete chaos, and Batman more and more towards the edge of the bad guy. Yet how to stop the Joker, when he's so unpredictable? Who will win? And at what cost?<br /><br />The first thing that jumps out at the viewer upon the start of the Dark Knight is how visually different it is from Batman Begins. No longer dark and claustrophobic, Nolan draws out the vastness of Gotham, perhaps emphasising the order that Batman has managed to inspire. Wide shots and open spaces are employed to great effect, allowing the viewer both to feel secure and helplessly alone, all depending on what's happening.<br /><br />The plot is a rocking roller coaster. It's nigh-on impossible to predict what's gonna happen next, and when it does you worry about will happen after that. Just like Gotham itself, the film starts out straightforward enough, then spirals more and more out of predictability and into - appropriately enough - chaos. At the centre of all this, of course, stands the Joker. The late Heath Ledger fully deserved his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor; his performance is mind-blowing to say the least. The Joker has never been a more fascinating character than here, in my personal opinion. You try to figure him out, then you wonder how you can; his two theories about his scars are enough to demonstrate this. A psychotically evil force, he manages to bring out the worst of everyone he comes into contact with, and somehow - and this is the real clinch - manages to keep his hands clean of the many miseries he causes. Perhaps what's most frightening about the Joker is how everything he says - terrible and crazy though it may be - somehow makes sense. His speech to Harvey Dent about chaos has me dumbfounded and terrified at how convincing it sounds.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Christian Bale continues to develop his Batman, a far more three-dimensional Bruce Wayne than any of his predecessors could manage. Wayne is isolated, broken, even a little detached. Batman is the only way the true potential of his personality can be unleashed. Aaron Eckhart is perfect as white knight Harvey Dent, whose pure heart is perhaps in most danger from the Joker. His performance is electrifying and charismatic, yet always with a tangible sense of insecurity. That's not an easy balance to pull off and Aaron Eckhart did it with wonders. Maggie Gyllenhaal takes the role of Rachel Dawes from Katie Holmes, and I must say that I like the exchange. Not only do she and Bale have much more believable chemistry as the two childhood friends, she inhibits the character really well in her bold determination to stand up to injustice. Michael Caine is wonderful as Alfred, is the root to reality that Bruce Wayne needs; a warm and compassionate father figure to keep him sane when things are at their worst. Gary Oldman then clinches the deal as Lt. Gordon, as incorruptible as Wayne. To be frank, each and every performance is spot on. There is not a moment of flat acting in this entire picture, and it sees many characters. Even Russian ballerina Natasha,who appears for about five minutes of the film, is an intriguing character.<br /><br />Powerful themes are dealt with in this film. Who is to blame? The one causing the miseries or the hero who refuses to give in to his demands? Batman often finds himself on the receiving end of the fear-tinged fury of Gotham, being an obvious target. Because the Joker deals in such deception, he is harder to target and thus easier to fear. So people turn on Batman if he refuses to give in to the Joker's ultimatum, promising order in Gotham if Batman turns himself in. This is a very interesting and sadly authentic human flaw that Jonathan Nolan has caught. Just whom should we be fighting against when we can't get to the one behind the misery? That doesn't just go for Batman. Nolan's script is truly superb, leading to a story that begs for repeated viewings. I spoke of how the film gets more and more chaotic. Believe me, after the film draws to a close, you are probably rooted to your seat.<br /><br />However, a number of factors rend the whole experience apart. At times the plot is completely unbelievable, and loses the audience with its rapid transitions. After Batman saves Rachel at the party, we cut to another scene. Wasn't the Joker still there? What, did he just decide to go home? Also, who are those \\"five dead, two of them cops\\" that Gordon talks about late in the film? Then there is a character who dies, only to turn out to have faked their death. The craziest thing, though, was how Batman somehow connected a fingerprint from a bullet at a murder scene to the location where the Joker kept captured guards and distracted the guards with a timed curtain. I don't see how anybody could make that connection and this remains the biggest problem I have with The Dark Knight.<br /><br />That's the problem with The Dark Knight, too. There's simply too much going on to keep track of, and there is often such suspension of disbelief. The film takes itself way too seriously. I miss the colourful, creepy Gotham city, including the one in Batman Begins. Gotham doesn't look or feel at all like Gotham, just like any random US city. The Joker, also, is too smart to be believable. He foresees absolutely everything that happens and this really starts to become silly after a while. While the performances are first-class and the action and deep-seated themes will root you to your seat, I think Nolan would do good to step back and retrieve more of the fantasy aspect of Batman, such as in the animated series.es of the film, is an intriguing character.

B001CD6FKI|4.0|I would run home from school everyday to watch the original cartoon and I wasn't sure this new film would do justice to one of my favorite childhood memories. 'Speed Racer' the movie does a great job of capturing the excitement of the cartoon for the most part, but there are a few small problems.<br /><br />The film's super slick look and chaotic races are jarring at first, but once you settle down and realize this is a new vision, fans of the original should be happy. The races are a little confusing at times which is a little frustrating, but the overall feel of the film is very good.<br /><br />The cast is perfect except for Sparky.... who isn't really bad in the role, but does not resemble the original character in the cartoon! I wish there was more of the Mach 5 and the use of it's many weapons and gadgets as the film is over two hours long....you would think there would be plenty of screen time for the use of the gadgets!<br /><br />I'm not bashing the film as it was way better than I expected it to be, but I can understand some fan's frustrations with it. One other problem is you had better have a state of the art monitor to view this film on or your poor TV set will be battling to keep up with the incredible graphics!<br /><br />Speed Racer is a insane ride and for the most part you should be amazed, just be prepared to have some frustration in the process! I can only hope that DVD sales are very good, because I would love a sequel that might fix some of these flaws. Go Speed Racer Go!
B001R0CSXO|5.0|Oh, if ONLY this album had gotten just a bit more play in these here parts 30 years ago.....it is, arguably, one of the best guitar records ever made, but then again, Michael Schenker's work with UFO was already downright spellbinding (see \\"Born To Lose\\" on Obsession for ample evidence; still one of the most plaintive, finest axe solos ever conceived - YES, the man really does deserve every superlative I accord him to describe his playing; the taut, tasty - and I MEAN 'tasty' - textures are like nothing before or since - closest in comparison might be to say it's equal parts Ronnie Montrose, Leslie West and Mick Ronson) but from start to finish, the German-born brother of Scorpions' rhythm guitarist Rudolf and equally musical sister Barbara sets a standard for excellence that simply does NOT let up. Fledgling vocalist Gary Barden, keyboard vet Don Airey, bassist Mo Foster and legendary session drummer Simon Phillips distinguish themselves in coloring the material aptly.    While Michael has wrestled with a lingering reputation for wrecklessness from the Seventies onward (prematurely ending multiple stints in both UFO and the Scorps) the remastering of his debut and its follow-up demonstrates that he very much cares about his work and fans alike. Any complaints about the production on both albums (especially MSG, the second) will likely be forgotten with the first few notes of \\"Armed and Ready\\" or \\"Are You Ready To Rock\\"; it is clear, loud and full. Schenker's first effort is damned funky (\\"Feels Like A Good Thing\\") pounding (\\"Victim of Illusion\\", \\"Into The Arena\\") rhythmic (his deft yet thundering Nostradamus saga \\"Cry For The Nations\\") haunting (\\"Lost Horizons\\", the unforgettable lead of which defies description, compares favorably to \\"Dazed And Confused\\") and melodic (\\"Tales Of Mystery\\") all at once.....you just cannot go wrong with this collection and, to a slightly lesser extent, its follow-up if loud, melodic British rock in keeping with, say, classic and moreemotive Rainbow is your thing. Feels like a VERY good thing, indeed!
B001FB55LW|5.0|When I first heard about this film, I immediately thought of Jim Carrey's early film effort 'Liar Liar'! The story of a man who can't lie or a man who can't say no sound very similar or might have similar results, but this film is quite different and very funny.<br /><br />Carrey is at his comedic best in this well paced and mostly hysterical romantic comedy. His relationship with Zooey Deschanel seems believable and the pair are very charming together. The film has some raunchy moments, but nothing that should offend most viewers.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I've watched this movie.  It's a classic and I don't think I'll ever get tired of it!
B001T3RA8M|5.0|LOVE this book! Readers of all ages can enjoy it in my opinion. It can be read as a stand alone or as the first in the series. For everyone who enjoys action, magic, characterization, suspence, strong females, and a touch of romance.
0240810961|5.0|One of my huge dreams when I was younger was to work at the Disney Animation Studios and work under (and hopefully alongside:) animation greats like Mark Henn, Glen Keane, and Andreas Deja.  That never happened and I pursued other things, but I've always wondered what it would have been like if I had:)  This book kind of makes you feel like you're there...sitting next to the greats and listening, learning and drawing alongside all the animation heroes who have also been taught by Walt Stanchfield.  Many of those same animators' drawings adorn the text and give glimpses into the teachings and notes that fill every page.  The text itself is quite amazing...informational and extremely inspiring.  I've become a bit rusty in many areas of drawing, but this book helped me remember why I ever (as a boy) wanted to pick up a pencil in the first place.  It might sound a bit dramatic (and perhaps it is) but cracking open this book made me remember drawing superheroes at 3 am in the morning on an old dusty table in a closet sized room... drawing mickey mouse in Biology class and trying (in vain) to draw a successful flip book with my typing paper.  Drawing was often fun in those day... and was more about adventure and exploration and expression than the often goal-oriented and perfectionistic ruts that I've often walked in since.  So maybe it sounds silly, but this book kind of helped make drawing fun for me again...and kind of helped breathe new life into an art form that I had placed on a dusty shelf.  There's such a wealth of information that one could easily read the book several times and not get it all, but what's great about this book is it's kind of written as if Walt Stanchfield himself is coming alongside you and helping you along on this journey of art (and specifically drawing).  Each lesson is rather quick and usually concentrates on one point (gesture, or variety, or not copying a pose but feeling it from the inside out).  One can read it in gulps or in small increments and still gain a wealth of information and encouragement.  I can see that an animator especially would enjoy this book, but I bought this book as mainly a drawing help aid and the lessons contained within would apply to any artist.  So if you love to draw...or want to draw better, I would definitely recommend this book.  I doubt you'll be disappointed.  (Note:  As a youngster I submitted a portfolio to Disney for review.  Their training department sent me a packet of drawings for my help and inspiration drawn from the likes of Walt Stanchfield, Glen Keane and Andreas Deja. Many of those same drawings and hundreds more are contained within these pages.  They are amazing to see).ements and still gain a wealth of information and encouragement.

B001KMB6YG|1.0|I did not rent \\"Babylon A.D.\\" expecting it to rock my world. I only anticipated a halfway decent hour of mass-market sci-fi escapism somewhere along the lines of the \\"Riddick\\" movies (which I love BTW). Unfortunately, my expectations were not low enough...<br /><br />These characters are one dimensional, cookie cutter stereotypes, devoid of even a basic \\"cool factor\\" (like bad cartoon heroes). Groan worthy dialog, goofy facial expressions, flat jokes, forced tension...<br /><br />Action in Babylon A.D. is infrequent. When something does happen, it's cliched, embarrassingly choreographed and very, very boring. There was almost a cage fight, but then there wasn't...<br /><br />The plot is mentally insulting, even anger inducing at points. Yes, I watched the extended cut...<br /><br />I strongly recommend that you do not watch this, as it could very well ruin your evening, and compel you to write a review of warning, when all you desperately want is to drown your memory of it.
B0000026NC|5.0|Extreme Pink Floyd CD.<br />If you like this band and don't have a copy of DSOT,<br />then either download it here at Amazon, or preferrably,<br />get this CD. The mix is very good, and the track list<br />really couldn't be better for what was available to them<br />in their catalog at the time. I recently purchased the VHS<br />version here at Amazon which includes \\"the great gig in the sky\\" live<br />(because the DVD version doesn't include that song)<br />because I had to see this show!<br />It's better than\\"Pulse\\", which as everyone knows, is great!<br />Thats it for my review, except to add a couple of facts<br />that seem to be disputable here.<br /><br />1. Pink Floyd added a 3 piece female vocal section in 1973<br />as part of the band, at the insistence of producer Alan Parsons<br />during Dark Side of The Moon pre-proddution rehearsals.<br />They aren't just \\"backup\\" singers.<br />Their parts are written and performed very precisely<br />They are another instrument in their sonic arsenal.<br /><br />2. The bass is heavy because Roger Waters learned from<br />Chris Squire the secret of using a preamp-crossover - power amps in a rack instead of a  bass amp live onstage, and he had 4 X 18 inch speakers on either side of Mason's drums for his low end. Pink Floyd had a HUGE bass guitar sound live. So the new lineup kept with that formula.<br /><br /> Most in my age group would rather listen to new music very different and more trendy than this,  but this live CD is really something. GET THIS CD!<br />You wil really like it.<br />Oh! I forgot...<br />I wanted to say Rachel Fury ROCKS in this show,<br />(so do the other \\"backup\\" singers)
B001R4MEYS|5.0|I love the album... specially the first, fourth and seventh song... it's just amazing!!!! Can't wait to see them @ NYC
B001PPLIEG|1.0|Don't ask me what this movie was about, b/c I have no clue. The plot made no sense and everyone's thick accents made the dialogue hard to follow. The usual chase scenes.....zzzzzzz..nothing new here.<br />If you want to watch some James Bond, check out the older ones with Sean Connery instead.
B000UBN22M|5.0|As with most bands, what a fan considers a great song and deserving of being included on a greatest hits release is subjective.  That being said, this release won't disappoint a Creedence Clearwater Revival fan.  There's a lot of fine music here to enjoy and listen to over and over again.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|I buy everything from porcupine tree or Steven Wilson,this last \\"insurgentes\\" is brilliant!I am 50 years old stay at home mom,found porcupine tree few years ago by accident looking for something new and fresh in music world and found better,than i hoped for,also recently came upon \\"riverside\\" from Poland,have every cd from them too.With music like that there is hope,that MUZAK is not winning! I read some of the negative reviews and I have to say I am amazed that some buy music not knowing what they are going to get - just going by other reviewers opinions! There are ways to check the music by going to utube or other places. I would never buy the cd or anything for that matter just because others put 5 * !! and then go on lowering the artists rating because they got mad that by their own not thinking  bought the CD!!! and then there are those who were expecting something like \\"in absentia\\", but there was another absolutely amazing album \\"The Incident\\" which showed the direction of the PT and Steven Wilson are going to - much heavier  and way more complex.For those who like nice songs,there are plenty of musicians out there making \\"songs\\" - happy and cheerful! Porcupine Tree never was about Cheerful singing! And that crazy comment about a dentist chair!!!!Good real music should be listened to. Steven's \\"Insurgentes\\" by far is the best album,not to mention it's complexity and beauty,is also on DVD-audio - a totally another experience in listening to a great artist ! I have met Steven in person and have to add to all of his talents - he is a super nice human being!!! Please listen to this album's songs before you buy it!!!!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|ECHOS Part I & II on this may be the single best piece of music ever created anywhere in the history of man.  If you are musically mature enough to handle this, then you should really listen to this.  I think this was as good as it got for Pink Floyd.   This was it.  The epicenter of goodness.     I dont care if the directors cut isn't that good.  It doesnt matter.  This director still came up with one of the best ideas ever, in the original.  As far as I am concerned, he deserves to be allowed to come up with some mediocre filler.  All the orig. video was lost, anyhow, unfortunately.
6305078564|5.0|I just love this movie!!! This is one of my favorite movie of all times. This movie is 5 hours long but it is worth. You may like the 2 hour version but there is more details in the movie and more scenes that would miss. I gives this 5 stars!!! And I like the actor and actress who plays Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy in this!
B000002KGT|1.0|I listened to this album, and my eardrums popped. Stevie Nicks' vocals are so high, he sounds like a girl. Seriously, sing like a man, like Chad Kroeger from Nickelback.<br /><br />Oh, and another thing wrong with this album is that there is no 'U' in 'Rumors.'
0545128285|3.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a collection of Wizarding Fairytales. This of course is all fictional, but the idea is that Hermione Granger has translated the classic fairytales from ancient runes. There are notes from J.K. Rowling who shares her insight as the author who is retelling the story for the muggle world and, of course, Albus Dumbledore's notes on each story and his take on what the story was trying to teach young witches and wizards.<br /><br />There are a total of five short stories. All interesting and with different twists at the end. I did find the footnotes, which are to be believed written by Albus Dumbledore, very interesting and insightful to this well known character from the Harry Potter books.<br /><br />Being the big Harry Potter fan that I am, you would think I would have ran out the day this was released to buy it, but I didn't. I'm not sure why I wasn't prompted to buy this book the first day, but I can tell you I'm glad I didn't.<br /><br />I was very surprised by the writing style of this book. No, I didn't expect it to be like the Harry Potter books, but I did expect to find the same author voice. But I didn't. I found this book to be very different from what I've seen of J.K. Rowling's writing style and I frankly think she didn't do a very good job.<br /><br />I found the stories with in The Tales of Beedle the Bard very much like the classic fairytales written by The Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Anderson. Both collections I just happen to own and have read numerous times. If you have read the original versions of our famous fairytales one would know they do not always end with happy endings. Or are written in a child friendly way, much like the stories from The Tales of Beedle the Bard.<br /><br />What bothered me was the fact four of the five stories were based on these old classic fairytales. Yes, the characters where changed and the fact they had magical powers is a big difference, but the plot lines were the same. The one story that I did truly enjoy and I felt was original was the very last one entitled, The Tale of the Three Brothers. This short story gives you insight to the last Harry Potter book and the series as a whole. You see the story is about the brothers who cheated death. Whom we only briefly learn about in the seven and final book of the Harry Potter series. I loved reading this story and learning more about these brothers and why the Ring, Wand, and Cape did what they did. Why they were so important for Harry to have when he battled He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and the riddle Dumbledore left Hermione, Ron, and of course Harry to solve after his death.<br />I do not discourage those who are fans of Harry Potter not to read this book. I think children will truly enjoy it. But for those of us who grew up on the classic fairytales, you may be disappointed.was original was the very last one entitled, The Tale of the Three Brothers.

B0000E5NPZ|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I first  saw it when I was very young.  It is sad but funny, too, although not a comedy.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins is a smart, well-informed scientist, so one would expect to find some fairly good arguments from biology in his atheist manifesto--yet he ventures pretty far beyond the scope of his degree in The God Delusion to attack every influential argument for the existence of God he can get his hands on.  Somewhat surprisingly, and perhaps most impressively, he is able to provide considerable factual and logical support for all his points with diligent and energetic discursiveness.    The God Delusion doesn't have the giggle-inducing satirical tang of Hitchens' \\"God Is Not Great\\"--such pointed sarcasm that makes Hitchens such an entertaining character is simply not Dawkins' strong point.  What one sees in The God Delusion is Dawkins' pedagogic skill as he patiently walks the reader through a rather large field of information and argument.  You don't come away from this book feeling like you've witnessed a beating (such as with Hitchens) but, rather, you put it down feeling painlessly and comfortably educated.    If you hold a strong faith in God, you probably won't find this to be quite as comfortable a read as I did, but if you value your intellect as well as your faith you should definitely give this a shot, if for no other reason, to understand what modern scientific and philosophical discourse exists on the topic of God.
B001TOD92C|4.0|Much has been said about Mickey Rourke losing the Oscar this year to Sean Penn in the film MILK. While I agree that Penn is a solid actor, I think the talk is right on this one. Rourke deserved the nod.<br /><br />In THE WRESTLER, Rourke plays Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a wrestler past his prime still making a small living playing in small local area matches. Gone are the heydays of the big arenas and crowds cheering him on. But the crowds that come to see him still remember those days with fondness.<br /><br />Battered and bashed, Randy survives on pain meds and working part time in a grocery store moving freight. While still in better shape than most, the ravages of leaping off the top rope for his signature move has taken its toll. But he continues to get out there every weekend to the roar of the crowd.<br /><br />As Randy ekes out a living, he also develops affection for a young woman, a stripper at the local club named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei). Sadly, while Randy sees their conversations as a bit of a relationship, it's all business to Cassidy. It's nothing more than another situation where Randy is blinded by his own vision of reality compared to what it actually is.<br /><br />After a particularly brutal match, Randy walks off to be patched up due to the various glass, thumbtack, barb wire and board cuts and bruises. Shortly after they finish, he passes out in the locker room. When he wakes he discovers that he's had a massive heart attack and the doctors advise him not to get in the ring again.<br /><br />During a conversation with Cassidy, Randy takes her advice and contacts his daughter, a young woman now who he's rarely seen and never been there for. Her reaction to his visit doesn't go well, even knowing that he is dying. As the film progresses, the two eventually reconcile somewhat, only to have Randy blow it once again by not showing for a dinner.<br /><br />Beaten down by the world, unable to do what he loves most, Randy takes a full time job at the grocery working the deli counter. Between dealing with persnickety customers and old fans that recognize him in what he feels is a low level job, he loses it and quits. Unfortunately his relationship with Cassidy doesn't go a whole lot better.<br /><br />By the films end, Randy has decided to make a small payday by reuniting with his old nemesis The Ayatollah for a 20 year anniversary match. The pair used to be the top headliner and their matches were legend. Now it's time to go down fighting, to recapture his glory and to once more hear that roar of the crowd.<br /><br />Rourke does and outstanding job here as a washed up wrestler who has seen better days yet lives for those moments in the ring in front of the crowd. You feel so much for his character as he struggles day to day while dealing with that loss of years gone by. The punishment that he's put himself through, the suffering he now endures and all for those few moments of adulation that he treasures.<br /><br />The film gives a great behind the scenes look at the world of wrestling too. Fans all over the world know that it's not real in the sense that the outcomes are the results of pummeling and chair hits. Its set up from the get go and the storylines and in the ring moves are worked out in advance. But the drama involved is what keeps fans coming back. And there is indeed athleticism involved in their maneuvers.<br /><br />The major thing I walked away from in this film when it comes to professional wrestlers though wasn't the work involved, I'd known about that. It was the sadness seen in the figures that brought so much attention to their form of entertainment only to walk away with nothing but battered bodies and dreams of days gone by. And that truly is a sad notion to think of.<br /><br />The rise of characters in search of fame and glory has been a staple of the movies for years. The tales of their lives, past and present, offers some of the best stories ever filmed. THE WRESTLER is one of those stories.
B0015AARJI|3.0|This is identical to the controller that comes with the ps3. It works as advertised. All the comments from other users regarding the ergonomics of this controller are spot on. It's familiar and works fine but it needs an update as far as comfort. And unfortunately it has the same stupid lower triggers as the original ps3 controller. They essentially took a ps2 controller and removed the lower plastic strip that supports the l2 and r2 triggers causing your finger to slip off of them when the action gets intense. I haven't seen any other controllers out there with blue tooth, dual shock, and the ability to charge via usb. So for now I guess this is it...:]

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is an online comedy video that was cooked up by Firefly creator Joss Whedon during the writer's strike, and it most definitely does not fail to keep the viewer laughing his or her head off.  Starring Nathan Fillion, Neil Patrick Harris, and Felicia Day, it is the story of Dr. Horrible aka Billy (Harris) and his attempts to secure membership in the Evil League of Evil, as well as working up the courage to talk to his laundromat crush, Penny (Day).  He is constantly being thwarted in his efforts by the gorgeous Captain Hammer (Fillion), who utters one of the cheesiest lines in the history of filmed entertainment.<br /><br />That said, I must warn anyone thinking of buying this DVD: THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS.  Some of the humor is very adult and sophomoric, and I for one do not think that children should be exposed to this kind of humor until they are ready for it.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good video that will make the viewer laugh.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|Gosh.. Talk about disappointing.  I knew she was working on Bossa Nova and was hoping for just that. Instead this sounds more like easy listening. Her voice is just hiding behind the violins. I would love to hear her do some real Brazil like music instead. More like what Wanda Sah did. I do note the fact that all the songs are NOT Bossa or Brazilian, but the ones that are are just as mediocre.     I adore her but am not thrilled by this transition. Hoping for some REAL Bossa Nova next time???

Put this in your DVD collection right next to Boys in the Band, Making Love and Priscilla.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|There were super-hero movies before 1978's Superman, and some of them were pretty ok. Heck, there were even a couple Superman films. None were great. There's been many others since, some of which were pretty ok, some were great, and at least one (The Dark Knight), has completely changed the genre.<br /><br />But the first real genre changer was Superman.<br /><br />The plot for the film is somewhat minimalistic, centering around a first act introducing our character, a second act showing him in Metropolis and a third act thwarting Lex Luthor's evil scheme to... er... get real estate. Ahem. Apparently taking Ted Turner's methods and simply buying most of Wyoming didn't appeal.<br /><br />Needless to say in the real world his plan to drop California into the ocean and create water front property from desert would not work (dropping a nuke on the San Andreas fault would inconvenience anyone nearby for a nanosecond, but it wouldn't start an earthquake. Continental plates are huge). But really, the plot is secondary to the characters, and as embodied by actors such as Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman, the characters really come alive, especially Superman/Clark Kent, played by then-unknown actor Christopher Reeve.<br /><br />What can be said about Reeve's performance? In many ways it makes the film. He's entirely convincing as both Superman and Clark Kent. It's hard to be convincing as the hero and the secret identity, as learned by, for example, Brandon Routh in the disastrous Superman Returns, and along with Christian Bale and Toby McGuire, Reeve is one of the few to find the balance needed to play both. Reeve's performance in the film was in fact so iconic that DC Comics began to draw Superman to look more like Christopher Reeve and even now, over a generation since the film came out, Reeve is, and will always be, Superman to many people.<br /><br />The performance is far from the only iconic thing about the film. Remember John Williams' score for the movie? I bet you do. I bet right now the theme is playing through your head. So popular was that music that it was reused for Superman Returns, giving the film at least a few good points amongst the dross. Heck, much as I'm not big on the \\"can you read my mind?\\" song, I gotta admit, it sticks with you.<br /><br />The screenplay is also quite sharp and entertaining. To this day if you're around a certain sort of person and say, \\"Don't worry; I've got you,\\" they'll say back, \\"You've got me? Who's got you?!\\" It's also fun to see the level of cynicism displayed by the various people at the Daily Planet over this big, flying Boy Scout. The movie was made in the late 1970's, after all, and the attitudes reflect that.<br /><br />The tagline for the movie was \\"You'll Believe a Man Can Fly\\", and you know what? That's pretty damn accurate. The flying effects hold up well even though, though some of the other effects suffer. Now it's quite common to see people on screen flying all over the place, but this was the first movie to really do justice to human flight.<br /><br />The film is not without flaws. As I mentioned, the plot is paper thin, but it gets the job done, and Ned Beatty's character is a needless distraction. Despite that, it's a movie I still watch and enjoy from time-to-time, remembering when I was a little boy, amazed at seeing that a man could fly.
0452289963|2.0|I read this book and listened to the CD's on the advice of Oprah.  If you have ever had any sort of deep personal growth experience, a spiritual awakening or experience in a twelve-step program, I don't think this book will help you add anything to your life.  I felt Tolle missed the mark in many areas and had a haughty, condescending attitude.  In my thinking and feeling, most people who have had a true evolutionary experience are humble and open minded.  I agree that we overly identify with form, but so many others have said it better.  If you are a true novice in self-examination, it may have a few points that will help you.

B001PPLJIQ|4.0|The movie \\"The Reader\\" is based on Bernhard Schlink's semi-autobiographical 1995 novel of the same name. For the most part, the movie stays true to the novel and it is a movie that bears watching again and again, if only because it raises so many questions, having to do with the collective guilt of the German people due to the events of WW II, i.e. the Holocaust, the moral ambiguities and conflicts experienced by some of the characters, and the matter of redemption or absolution.<br /><br />The timeline of the story is in three parts, though viewers are taken back and forth between the three periods via flashbacks.In the present, Ralph Fiennes plays the mature Michael Berg who recollects the events of his youth that have left emotional scars on him. Viewers are taken via flashback to 1958, where Michael Berg [David Kross] is a 15-year-old schoolboy who first meets Hanna Schmitz [Kate Winslet] when he throws up because of scarlet fever. Hanna comes to his aid and when Michael recovers a few months later, he goes back to thank her. The young teen finds himself sexually attracted to Hanna, and very soon a torrid affair ensues between the two. The sex scenes themselves are muted and tastefully done, though there is a lot of graphic nudity, and I can understand how these scenes may put off some people, given that it is sex between a 30+ year-old woman and a 15-year-old boy [ David Kross had to wait till he turned 18 before filming the more graphic scenes]. But, given the story, the sex scenes are integral in establishing the nature of the relationship between the two and how this later affects both of them.<br /><br />Michael is engrossed by Hanna, and finds it hard to accept how she distances herself from him in terms of revealing more about herself [for quite some time, he doesn't even know her name]. Hanna is drawn to Michael for reasons of her own, one being that she loves listening to him read to her - works such as Lady Chatterley's Lover, a novel by Chekhov etc. The pair find happiness and lose themselves in each other, but one day Michael comes to Hanna's flat and finds her gone.<br /><br />Eight years later, Michael is a young law student who attends a trial of Nazi war criminals, and is stupefied to find Hanna one of the defendants. he is mortified to realize that Hanna used to be an SS guard at a concentration camp. Even more so, as the trial progresses, he makes a startling discovery, one that could help Hanna in her defense. The decision he makes is one that will haunt him for the rest of his life.<br /><br />\\"The Reader\\" is an emotionally-charged movie that deal with a multitude of issues - the guilt of an individual vs the collective guilt of the German people for the Holocaust, the pangs of first love and of two souls connecting despite all the social taboos that frown upon such associations, the matter of atonement or lack of it, redemption etc. In the capable hands of the director, the viewer is able to follow the story as it presents all these issues - and I came to  understand the main characters with all their complexities and conflicts.<br /><br />Winslet and Kross are to be commended for their credible character portrayals. In one of her finest performances [justifiably winning the Oscar], Winslet portrays a tormented soul who harbors a secret so shameful that she will not even use it in her defense. She can be aggressive one moment, yet tender and passive the next, and the mercurial changes in her behavior are so credibly portrayed by her vivid facial expressions and manner of speech. Kross beguiles in his performance as the besotted schoolboy who loves passionately and who later feels 'betrayed' by what he discover about Hanna's past, vacillating between hurt, anger and a yearning for the one woman he truly loved. Ralph Fiennes also does a credible job as the mature Michael who has to come to terms with his past.<br /><br />\\"The Reader\\" is a compelling movie indeed.piness and lose themselves in each other, but one day Michael comes to Hanna's flat and finds her gone.

The decision he makes is one that will haunt him for the rest of his life.    \\"The Reader\\" is an emotionally-charged movie that deal with a multitude of issues - the guilt of an individual vs the collective guilt of the German people for the Holocaust, the pangs of first love and of two souls connecting despite all the social taboos that frown upon such associations, the matter of atonement or lack of it, redemption etc. In the capable hands of the director, the viewer is able to follow the story as it presents all these issues - and I came to  understand the main characters with all their complexities and conflicts.     Winslet and Kross are to be commended for their credible character portrayals. In one of her finest performances [justifiably winning the Oscar], Winslet portrays a tormented soul who harbors a secret so shameful that she will not even use it in her defense. She can be aggressive one moment, yet tender and passive the next, and the mercurial changes in her behavior are so credibly portrayed by her vivid facial expressions and manner of speech. Kross beguiles in his performance as the besotted schoolboy who loves passionately and who later feels 'betrayed' by what he discover about Hanna's past, vacillating between hurt, anger and a yearning for the one woman he truly loved. Ralph Fiennes also does a credible job as the mature Michael who has to come to terms with his past.    \\"The Reader\\" is a compelling movie indeed.

B000G73UEU|3.0|I love Leonard Cohen and his magnificent music - but was completely devastated when I got this CD and eagerly played it, anxious to hear again the glorious rendition of \\"Hallelujah\\" as performed in the film - and, lo and behold, it isn't even on the CD!<br /><br />Does anyone have an explanation as to why the best song in the film is not on its soundtrack?  And on what CD is this particular rendition to be found?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|I was not bothered by the new cg ship or all of the cleaning up that took place on this series, but rather thought it enhanced the already engaging story telling.  The special features are many (one per disk minimum) and well thought out.<br /><br />The crutch lays on the case design.  Sure, it looks cool, but it's a pain in the neck to get disks out.  First you open the clamshell, pull out the yellow case, shake out the disk holder (without losing the information sheets, THEN you can flip through the disks and hope nobody messed up the order cause you can only tell the disks by the tiny 5 point print around the center.<br /><br />Not only that, but this case is prone to breaking.  I've gotten one from the mail (here) and the second season from a store and both had cracks in the case.  To put the cherry on top, the guy that sold me his new copy through amazon neglected to tell me his was region 2 (instead of 1 like America).  I found a way to play it, but I guess that's what I get for ordering online.

0312360266|4.0|Please stop comparing this series to Twilight, it's not fair for either series. Each one has great things and is able to stand on it's own.    I enjoyed this book. It's nothing very deep and complex, it's something light and fun to read. I liked it enough to go out and get the next book in the series    I do agree that this book is dirtier than Twilight, I personaly wouldn't recommend it to anyone under 16, there are sexual situations and foul language
B000W7JWUA|5.0|If you can ignore the atrocious production quality of the game board (or lack thereof), you will discover one of the most fun, easy-to-learn, yet frustratingly challenging board games ever created. I never knew a board game could offer this sort of a gnarly test of strategic thinking.     Players assemble the game board using card board hexes, each of which represents a specific type of resource such as wood, brick, ore, etc. Since the hexes are randomly arranged, the resources are in different locations every game. Each resource hex is then assigned a production value (using pog-like tokens with the numbers 2-12 on them to correspond to the rolls of two six sided dice). These tokens or chits as they are called in the game are also randomly placed on the hexes and then players begin establishing their settlements, trying their best to locate where resources have high production values and are varied enough so that one is not stuck with only one type of resource. Once initial settlements are placed, players roll the dice in hopes that the numbers corresponding to their location will come up to produce resources for them. As the resources pour in players build roads, settlements, cities (upgrades from a settlements that double resource production), or development cards with special properties that can give advantages to whoever plays them. Players are allowed to trade resources with each other, with the bank, or at ports which give special trading advantages depending on the type of port. Eventually, after enough roads, settlements, cities, and development cards have been placed, one player has accomplished enough within the game to have accumulated the 10 victory points needed to win.    Although the dice bring variance into the game, a player's decisions do matter and better decisions usually prevail. But the dice can level the playing field enough that a newer player can beat someone who is more familiar with the game.    This game will probably eventually become aclassic and hopefully will find its way to the shelves of more mainstream retail stores. Board game players will find here a much more engaging experience than they would with a game like Monopoly and while this game is difficult to compare with something like Scrabble or even chess, backgammon, etc., it deserves a place with all of those in your library of games.

0670020478|2.0|I borrowed and read The Element before reading any of your reviews.    My initial reaction to the first quarter of The Element was YES!! I've been saying for years that schools are killing creativity & individuality. But as the book wore on reporting on one rich and famous person after another, I became sad that my life seems to be slipping away and I've done nothing to the betterment of my community or the world.  Then a few chapters later I was uplifted to find that it's still not too late.  So great, I'm ready, so how?  And then the book ends.    HOW?,  I scream How?!!!    I was also disheartened that there weren't more examples of ordinary people, like Dr. Robinson's mother, who contributed to their families and  communities by using intangible talents..ie, compassion, service, organization.  Being able to plan and execute an outing for disabled children to celebrate Earth Day is just as much  a talent as acting or playing the piano.  Doesn't get you much press and certainly doesn't make the Forbes 500 in salaries, but it's rewarding.  I enjoyed the book, but it left me frustrated.
1416550542|5.0|Kate Morton has created a multi-layered novel with stories embedded within stories that leave the reader hooked from the start and totally astonished at the end. The embedded stories contain secrets and unusual twists and turns which makes this one of the most original and creative books I have read in a long time. Initially, the reader is drawn deeply into the mysterious origins of the main character named Nell Andrews. Later, the reader is totally mesmerized by the discoveries Cassandra makes while researching Nell's reason for buying a cottage in a small town in Cornwall, England. Nell was an antiques dealer in Australia who remained a bit aloof and eccentric in her ways. She developed a close relationship with her granddaughter Cassandra at a time when Cassandra's parents were having a difficult time in their marriage. Nell's daughter, Lesley unexpectedly dropped off Cassandra to stay with her grandmother for a few weeks while she sorted our her marital problems. Cassandra was very young and felt abandoned. The first night, Nell heard Cassandra sobbing and consoled her. This cemented their bond of love for each other. Nell lived to the ripe old age of 95 and died with Cassandra staying at her bedside. Nell became confused toward the end and reverted back to when she was a child entrusted with a secret, to remain waiting for the Authoress and not leave the spot. She felt guilt because she *did* move and the Authoress did not return for her ...<br /><br />Nell Andrews was raised by adoptive parents who found her at the young age of four years sitting on a dock in London. All Nell had was a small suitcase which contained her clothes and a book of fairy tales. There was no identification on the case and the little girl claimed she did not know her name. She was told by the \\"The Authoress\\" they were playing a secret game and not to tell a soul about it. The dockmaster and his wife, who had no children of their own, took care of this little girl,  waiting and expecting someone to come looking for her. However, no one did. They had no children and they raised her as their own. She filled a void in their lives. Later, they moved to Brisbane, Australia to begin a new life, where no one would question anything about how they came to have a little girl. When Nell grew up, she became the older sister, caring for her siblings and developing a very close relationship with them. Her father made a decision on Nell's twenty first birthday which changed her life. He told her about her past and that she was not their biological child. This knowledge affected Nell very deeply. She felt her life was a lie and wanted very badly to discover her true origins and family roots. Her relationship with her sisters cooled and Nell unexpectedly cut off her engagment to a very fine young man who never was told the reason for her change of heart. Nell's life took a very different turn from what it would have been had she never found out she was a foundling ...<br /><br />After Nell died, Cassandra was left all her worldly possessions. To her great surprise, Cassandra was given a deed to a cottage in a small town in Cornwall, England. On the envelope, Nell had written: \\"For Cassandra,  who will know the reason why.\\"  Kate Morton writes a wonderful story which unravels the complex lives of an aristocratic British family, whose one daughter had married an American painter, named Nathaniel Walker. His career and reputation grew after he moved to England. On her visit to England, Nell discovered her family roots in a book, \\"Who was Who\\". In it, she read about this high society couple who had a daughter named Ivory who purportedly died of scarlet fever. Nell saw a painting by Nathaniel Walker of his family, including his child. She immediately recognized the painting of the child ... it was a painting of herself. Yet, this discovery was only the tip of the iceberg of a very deep story which is enormously appealing making this book difficult to put down. Kate Morton builds suspense, drama, and mystery as she provides the details of the lives of many fascinating and unforgettable characters. There are some shocking secrets hidden in the lives of this family which will astonish the reader. When visiting England to look at the property she inherited,  Cassandra is deeply entrenched in the mystery associated with Nell's life and manages to find something she had hoped for and longed for ... something which had eluded her in Australia: love. This is one of the best fiction books I have read this year.

0060833459|5.0|As an author and an intellectual, the late Peter F. Drucker was a true business sage. Recognized as the father of modern management, Drucker forecast numerous pivotal trends, including decentralization, privatization and the development of the information society. He introduced the concept of the \\"knowledge worker,\\" a term he employs widely in this fascinating book. His internal study of General Motors, Concept of the Corporation, greatly influenced how businesses conduct their affairs. Each Drucker book is a genuine business classic, including this one. getAbstract believes it will help you think productively about what you do. No one writes more intelligently or presciently on management and its functions than Drucker. All executives, even those who are already effective, will benefit from reading this informative, enlightening book.
B00004Y6O7|2.0|what can i say about this cd.  the band is flailing you can hear it. besides that there are some great guitar work and drumming. but by the time this cd was released when i heard it. it was the cassete version. i listened to it for days. and then its like all the joy and party antics that was vanhalen was gone.  i got irratated hearing daves antics. but on the plus side its got some original tunes. which is more than i can say for the diver down cd. which was only second in the worst cd ever created.  besides vanhalen 3.
0743298039|4.0|An excellent read simply on the merits that it keeps you reading. The actual story itself got a little \\"silly\\" at times. This isn't to say the plot twists weren't intriguing because, like I said, the book does keep you hooked. It's just that the execution was a little melodramatic.  I don't know why, but the author seemed obsessed with the use of italics.  It honestly got a little irritating.<br />Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.<br />Suggested with: A Pinot Noir and a \\"comfy\\" couch.
0312370849|5.0|Tatiana de Rosnay has written a heart-wrenching historical fiction novel about the Vel d'Hiv, the round-up of Parisian Jews in June, 1942 by the Vichy govenment...to be sent indirectly to Auschwitz for annihilation. This little-known low point in French history needs to be told. It's a quick read and impossible to put down.  Characters are well developed and there are really two intertwined stories, each quite compelling.  Kudos to Ms. de Rosnay on an excellent first novel.
0743454537|5.0|This is my first brush with Jodi Picoult's work and I can say with utmost confidence it not my last. For someone who has never experienced long term illness in a loved one first hand, I found the subject matter of this book very difficult to wrap my head around. It is a mark of an amazing author when her book throws a reader into a tailspin of thought provocation and manages to entertain the reader at the same time. What a FANTASTIC reading experience.<br />Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.<br />Suggested With: Hot Chocolate and a warm bed on rainy morning.
B001W79MBI|5.0|This movie made a one day appearance at the theaters and thanks to a killer trailer I made a point of not missing it. Despite the movie being relatively new, there's a strange nostalgia I felt while watching it. For one, most or all of the art is hand drawn. On the big screen, the line quality is very noticeable, especially since the past decade most animation has been exempt from any line quality at all en lieu of 3D. So seeing the hand of the artist in motion was a feeling I had missed from the old days of watching Charlie Brown :-) How I manage to put Charlie Brown and a Master Samurai in the same sentence...I don't know.    But anyway...    The other thing that grabbed me was that this movie actually spends time developing both story and its characters, and it does an incredible job at that. Granted, the plot itself is a bit cliche: The bad guys are after an immortality potion that requires a young boy, Kotaro, to be sacrificed in order for the potion to work. But the cliche is padded with a strong historical back drop that gives the story a surprising gritty realism. While so many movies chop away at a good story and evolving character elements, this one slows down just enough to make you actually care about the fate of the Nameless Samurai, Kotaro and even his dog.    The steady pacing was a good way to build up to an ending so loaded with tension that I could actually feel my muscles locked up. As the Nameless character does battle with his enemies, you can't help but to feel that he may be in way over his head. In a lot of way, the movie reminded me of \\"Ninja Scroll\\": there are a host of foes that the Nameless Saurai must confront and you'll have your doubts about his skills being matched to each one. Such doubts are the hallmark of a gripping story.
B001SF8G1Q|5.0|Finally a remastered version of New Morning. This was always one of my favorite Dylan albums since I bought it when it was first released. Great folksy jazzy (If Dogs Run Free) and of course Dylan's own version of his song If Not For You which George Harrison beautifully records on All Things Must Pass.  These new reissues caught be off guard. I read nothing about them as they seemed to have gotten lost amongst all the stories of Dylan's upcoming new album. The Basement Tapes too is a great release.<br /><br />Now where is the remastered Self Portrait. Most people hated that one more than any other (aside from Saved) but I want it NOW!!!
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|One of the most overrated indies ever.    Nothing but style.   SHALLOW.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|I've had the pleasure and honor of seeing Mr. Beck perform twice.  Once in 2000 and last week at the new Boston House of Blues.  Both times were just unbelievable,jaw-dropping performances.  This live cd captures his outstanding and out-of-this-world playing.  Backed by the talented Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, Jason Rebello on keyboards and last and certainly not least, Tal Wilkenfeld on bass.  Remember Ms. Wilkenfeld's name. This young, 23-year-old from Australia is a very, very talented bass player.  All his great songs are here, from Beck's Bolero to Led Boots, to the Beatle's A Day in the Life, which is just phenominal and my favorite Beck song Where Were You and many more.  If you've ever seen Jeff in concert this a great keepsake and reminder of how great a guitarist he is and if you haven't this will make you want to go out and catch him live.
B0009VRHLK|3.0|If you have patience and enjoy art films, this is really fine stuff.  Gallo compells the audience with mood, humor, and sheer will.  His energy as a filmmaker is through the roof and hypnotic.    The only downsides are the porn scene with Sevigny(it really was not needed and adds nothing, feels tacked on.)  And also the fact that the movie has a heroin 70's feel to it that you see in magazine ads all the time.  So it's not that original a style.    Those complaints aside, it's shows a lot of heart and courage.
B0026ICMOG|5.0|Gotta admit this does look kinda cool,contains the Blu Ray and plushes of all 7 seven dwarfs,I'm sticking w/ the standard Blu Ray/DVD combo release!!! But if you like plushes,the 7 dwarfs,and Blu Ray then this set is for you! This set would not survive it's collectablity in my household,because my my 2 nephews(who I love dearly) who live w/ me would have them out and playing w/ them in no time!!! This is a cool deal because it contains pluhses w/ all 7 dwarfs and comes in hat box style case!
B001MYIXAC|1.0|I loved this movie and wanted to show my support for it by preordering two months ahead, and what I got was a kick in the face.  As many others have explained, it mainly has to do with the retranslated subtitles, which blows hard.  The extra contents was weak too, to add salt to the wound.  And now they're saying they won't exchange for something they screwed up.  What a POS move.  I won't support this company again.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Mirror mirror on the wall,this is the Disney classic that started it all!,coming in a great Blu Ray + DVD package,so you can play in it on your Blu ray Player or a standard dvd player,always good to have choices,since I have BOTH Blu and dvd players in my home/van. This is sure to look and sound awesome on Blu!!! Heck the original 2 DVD set from years ago was no sloutch in the quality dept,this one should even be better! I Can't wait!!! FYI,there are also expensive deluxe Blu Ray versions being released as well for die hard fans,for me the thus version will do the job!!!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|George Lucas listen up...The Original Trilogy is great, however, I did like some of the improvements Lucas made and others not so well.  Why is it so hard to make a dvd/or blu-ray where you can choose what special or original scenes you want to see when you watch the film.  The menu screen should take you to a description of the scenes and you check the boxes that you want or don't want.  It's the Definitive Star Wars set for EVERYBODY.  You make everyone happy if you do that.  The only bad thing is when you want to start the movie, you'd have to go through all those checks.  Maybe, you can have a 1977 Original, 2004 or 2006 Special Edition check boxes.  I still think it would be great to be able to make your own version, just the way you like it.  Just like Burger King, have it YOUR way.  That way you don't have to buy 3-4 different versions to get what you want, that's just crazy.  Us fans only want to buy ONE, 1 version, that's all nothing else.  I can't wait to own these on blu-ray, just hope they put it out right, which means fix it right first.  Fix the color correction.  If anybody has seen Adywan's Star Wars revisited on Youtube, that's exactly what I want.  I intend to buy his version over anything George wants to put on dvd or blu-ray.  I'll be waiting as long as it takes for the version I want.
B0026ICMLY|5.0|If you are a Snow White fan then this is the Blu Ray set for you,Me, personally will be happy with the much cheaper Blu Ray/DVD combo,it's the movie that I care about! Looks like it comes w/ a ton of goodies for the true fan! Like I said before If you really Like Disney's Snow White,then this is the set for you!!!
B001KL3GWM|5.0|Derek Trucks lives up to the high opinion that other musicians have of him. He has played with Eric Clapton, Johnny Winter, The Allman Brothers, and Susan Tedeschi (to whom he is married.)    Very good album that deserves to be in your library.
B00158K0S8|5.0|This is one of the great all-time classics!!! And it's now on Blu Ray!!! The PQ and sound are incredible! The extras(lots of them)ARE on a standard DVD,but that's a very minor qibble,an incredible film looking and sounding better than ever on Blu Ray Disc!!! This is a 2 disc set with the film on Blu Ray on disc one and lots of special features on standard DVD on disc two.

B000AOEMXM|4.0|Where would Trekkies be without Subterranean Caves? Episodes of \\"Enterprise\\" are an homage to Star Trek's enormous creative entirety. The original Trek aspired to break away from defining humans via false racial or geographic differences. The Trek universe explores what it means to be human; our shared fragility, fallibility, and uniqueness is underlined and illuminated by encounters with alien cultures.<br /><br />Enterprise's entire cast is deft and pitch-perfect in this Shakespearean Space Theater. There's jovial commeraderie, no Drama Queens chew the scenery. Captain Archer's dog Porthos delights. Historic Trek story-threads are developed, like the Prime Directive, halosuites, Vulcan mythology/mind melds, why Klingons looked odd in the past, and more. Details differ, diverge, and sometimes converge: although not spray-bottles, there are glowing, colorful bottles of fluid in Sick Bay, as in the Original Series.<br /><br />Don't punish the creative hard work in \\"Enterprise\\" due to mistakes, and deprive yourself of real Trek fun. The series is saddled with Diane Warren's horrible, corny, bellowing, non-Trek opening musical score. Speed through this dated ballad to view graphics, or skip and silence the singing. The fab woo-woo and bongo drums of the Original Star Trek series is more futuristic. Even the dramatic music of the \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" episodes would have been better. Unfairly, the writer and the singer of the awful score are named, but the credits don't list primary cast members with their roles, as in Deep Space Nine. Forgive this not looking exactly like the early series, as the interior visually approximates a submarine rather than the carpeted hallways of previous series. The inappropriate uniforms don't reflect the Original Series look, and the two episodes following the opening pilot \\"Broken Bow\\" don't do the show any favors, along with desperate attempts to add eye-appeal.<br /><br />The cast gels, and the \\"Enterprise\\" team works beautifully; time and again the acting is subtle and superb. It's worth ignoring initial attempts to make the show foolishly provoctive/trendy. Connor Trinneer's acting is graceful and deft (though his role is subjected to inexplicable suffering at the hands of the ever-shrinking Vulcan). Trek fans must experience outstanding episodes such as \\"Carbon Creek,\\" where first-contact was not in Bozeman, MT, or Roswell, NM (my stomping grounds), but earlier; this story is a valentine to Trekkies. \\"Unexpected\\" deals with an exotic alien ship and male pregnancy; Vulcan conflicts are explored in \\"The Andorian Incident\\" (see the infamous DSN's Weyoun, the superb Jeffrey Combs, in another incarnation, with blue skin and those wonderful mobile antennas); the wonderful \\"Dear Doctor,\\" Phlox considers disease & evolution. One of the best Sci-Fi shots ever depicted is in \\"Proving Ground,\\" beyond the back of Bakula's head, two expressive little blue Andorian antennae wave. \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" is an amazing two-part sequence that meets the future lost ship Defiant (caught in a Tholian Web during Kirk's run), with great opening music (for once), sequences with the sword through the world emblem, and the \\"Enterprise\\" cast in the Original Series uniforms. Even the super-colorful Trek food & liquids are reproduced on the sleek old/new Defiant.<br /><br />Huge speed-bumps impare the Enterprise journey with the woefully placed, misguided WWII timeline what-ifs: \\"Storm Front I & Storm Front II.\\" The pace returns right after these dreadful episodes, but the last episode totally sucks, thrown together in the shock of cancellation.<br /><br />If you're experiencing Star Trek withdrawal, give this enjoyable, good-hearted series a chance, speeding through the initial shock of the horrible, inappropriate opening musical score, to get to the meat and taters of a really great addition to any true Trekkie DVD collection.e and again the acting is subtle and superb.

B001DJ7PR8|2.0|What an insufferable film from an equally insufferable director.  Woody Allen has lost whatever humor and cultural significance that he may have once had, if only tenuously.  Barcelona, the city and its spirit, are reduced to a Let's Go postcard under his care.  Not comical, not provocative, aesthetically conventional, the film essentially smears Europe's most beautiful \\"ciutat.\\"  Let us count its many oozing blemishes: a flat and not effectively ironic narrator (the technique and voice nauseate), a pervasive neurotic New Yaakness (ie. Allen's tired aura) which infects all the actors, including Bardem, and the now tiresome comparison of bohemian and bourgeois values.  The actors don't have the humor or presence to hold up such a trite plot.  Unintentionally, we Americans, represented here by some truly abyssmal acting, are once again seen as uniformly banal.  The scene in which Johannson kvetches ad nauseum on the plane trip back from Oviedo is truly painful.  The one saving grace is Penelope Cruz.  With a matador's stare she jabs her nymphfetish \\"guapa\\" rival, played by Johannson, who can mutter just one foreign phrase, in Chinese: \\"You think that sounds pretty?\\"  In customary form Cruz sizzles, her hair dishevelled in a tangle of black, a cigarette dangling precariously from lips that speak without speaking.  She's the only thing worth watching in this disaster, save the architecture and light of the Catalan capital.
0930289234|5.0|This book, or rather, graphic novel, is amazing. I purchased it because I saw the movie and wondered what had been changed. There was enough left in the movie to make it good, but this is most definately worth the read. The small points that were left out were incredibly entertaining. If Rorschach was your favorite character, this will be much better than the movie. He's a bad bad good guy.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Katy's a leggy brunette with car loads of sass.  Pop lures at the hip, this songstress throws out melodic hooks that could catch even the coldest, meanest shark in the waters.  Catchy songs, great face, cheeky lyrics.  It's a winning formula.  This album is a veritable pop masterpiece, and not just the hits, which are all war cries of our schizophrenic, gender confused cyber era.  The other tunes slowly emerge as gems too: there's the pretty-in-pink yearning of \\"Manequin\\" with its swooning bridge, a calm before another storm, or the heavy drama of the surprisingly affecting \\"I'm Still Breathing.\\"  The nuances are legion.  Most pop is by definition disposable.  Not in Perry's case, however, as she wades through a wasteland of wooden, deficient Cali beauzos with wit and humor, staking a claim as our dysfunctional nation's best looking, smartest twenty-nothing.  She's a spokeswoman, a goddess, a ham -- see the very funny video for \\"Hot N Cold.\\"  She can keep the cherry chapstick though: that stuff is just plain nasty.  Thank the Lord she didn't stick with speaking in tongues.  Thanks for going all secular on us Miss Perry.

B000G8NXYG|5.0|For purposes of this review, I'm going to assume you know the plot of \\"Seven Samurai\\" and its place as an esteemed film (do a little reading up on it if you don't). I will focus on the product itself.<br /><br />This is one of those rare \\"remastered editions\\" that is actually worth the buy. The movie itself is incredibly crisp and has all the \\"lost\\" footage, allowing the viewer to see the entire movie in a detail not seen since its theatrical release. The clarity, however, never detracts from the movie itself - it takes multiple viewing the fully grasp the content of each shot, including many details that were too small to notice in the VHS release.<br /><br />The subtitles are also crisp and clean, another vast improvement over the VHS. As another review already stated, the movie is only subtitled, not dubbed, so if you have poor eyesight keep that in mind.<br /><br />The movie itself is split neatly at the intermission (which has been left intact at the end of disc one) into a pair of DVDs, with a third disc of special features. There are two excellent bonus commentaries by film scholars - one solely by Michael Jeck, the other by four scholars (one at a time, each getting 25% of the movie), including Joan Mellen (who wrote the book - literally - on \\"Seven Samurai\\"). These commentaries are very insightful and discuss both thematic and theatrical elements of the movie.<br /><br />There is also a small booklet included that has various commentaries by film critics and a small piece by Toshiro Mifune. It's short but a nice little extra.<br /><br />If you like \\"Seven Samurai,\\" this is the edition you want, hands down.

B0015KO52S|5.0|Thruth is, I bought this CD because of the Grammy award it won this year for Sound Engineering. This because I'm a mastering engineer and I take this as another tool for the arsenal.  And I was not dissapointed.  This is a killer reference to compare any other job against.  Mastered by Vlado Meller, I think it's, from the sound engineering point of view, flawless.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Such great strives taken by Muse. Definitely best Album of 2007, hell even best album of the past 50 years!! Definetly worth more then the price, and if you get a chance to see them live...TAKE IT!
B00124HSZI|4.0|I wasn't too famaliar with Chicago, so i decided to listen to this album randomly. I thought they were pretty decent. I thought it was intersting how they tried to mix jazz in with rock. The overall mood of the album was enjoyable, but it was a tad bit outdated for me. I think this is a creative band that doesn't have as big of a name as the rolling stones or beatles, but still shouldn't get overlooked. If you a fan of classic rock or jazz music, Then i would look into buying this!
B001G0MFOM|1.0|I think tee shirts are in order here that simply say L Word 6 WTF ?  I own the other 5 seasons and I'll probably purchase season 6 only to complete the set (can we say OCD......) but I'm not too happy about it. What a waste of film and time. Maybe this was the plan all along; to have us endlessly write about how crappy the ending was ?? Too bad really, the show, characters and the fans deserved better.
1932100660|5.0|The China Study is a most important resource book for changing your life course.  You can either choose to wait for an outcome of either cancer or heart disease with a normal American diet, or you can avoid that scenario and life long prescription drug intake by going on a plant based diet. An in depth food analysis is given for various anti-cancer substances in everyday food. The charts are the most striking information correlating animal protein with cancer and heart disease.  As people become more affluent the animal protein intake increases resulting in an increase incidences of cancer and heart disease and a myriad of other problems we are just beginning to link.  I cannot believe the authors challenge the status quo by tackling the dairy industries and conventional medicine without pushing a magic pill or some other product.  I love the simplicity along with the scholarly methods used and the all important documentation.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|With Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Woody Allen has created yet another drop-the-viewer-in-the-middle-of-someone's-life story.  I like it.<br /><br />If nothing else, there's much to love about the setting of the story.  I love Barcelona...lot's of fond memories.<br /><br />But back to the movie. With a cast of strange and engaging characters (though only superficially), it's easy to let the light storyline string you along.  The extent to which we come to know each of the characters is limited to the voice over narration of following each.  Of the actors, Penelope Cruz was superb, but I love most anything she's in.<br /><br />Allen doesn't really make any effort to delve into the real implications of the choices each of these people make, but that didn't bother me as such.  I felt like I was reading a dime-store pulp book and perhaps it's the guilty pleasure feeling I got from watching this movie that made it so fun in the end.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Upon seeing this film for the first time, I knew instantly that I had to own it. The acting, storyline, and, of course, the music are all done to perfection, and the intimate camera work makes it seem as if the viewers are present in the film's events. Anytime someone asks me what this movie is like, my only response is that you must see it for yourself. \\"Once\\" is a truly unique and touching motion picture that should be far more well-known than it is. If you are interested in a departure from the typical Hollywood films these days, buy this film and you will be both refreshed and delighted.
0440241413|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I laughed so much, my husband had to read it to find out what was so funny.  He enjoyed it as well.  We tried to complete the series, but I couldn't get through the 2nd book.  After the first, you know what's to follow.
B001YYQ9SS|3.0|I live in Japan so bought this the day it was released.    Watching it on my High-Def 37\\" TV, I can say it does look and sound very nice, but to be honest, not THAT much better than the DVD release which I watched on the same TV. It in all honesty looks roughly the same.    But I didn't buy it for the movie which is so-so (I love the game).    The FFXIII demo is real the reason to get this bundle. The game is simply gorgeous, fluid, minimal loading times, and has an evident epic storyline. Honestly it is like playing a CG version of say, FFX on the PS2. The demo takes roughly an hour to play too, and gives you a good idea of something much bigger to come.    The movie is well, alright quality wise. I guess if I had not seen it on DVD I would have been more 'blown away' by it.
B001MYIXAC|2.0|Excellent movie, and I hate to say it, but if you want to hear the original theatrical translation, you will need to listen to it dubbed.
0307474275|1.0|Pardon me, but if this passes for \\"literature\\" then let's all welcome each other to the Dark Ages. Yes I know, Dan is laughing all the way to the bank and I understand how one can get rich hitting a cultural nerve, but in this case, the nerve is mass hysteria and cultural ignorance. Not least of all, it is painful to witness the public execution of the English language. I threw the book out after 50 pages. No, that's not quite true. I recycled it.
B000001BZT|4.0|I really like this album overall, and there are several really good tracks, but overall it still feels a little garage-band-ish.  Not bad, really, but a little short on personality.      The picture of Steve on the back, though, in sleeveless shirt and giganto-mullet, is pretty priceless.
B0000714BP|5.0|Thanks for sending the DVD so fast.. I just got rid of my VHS copy of this movie and it's one of my all time favs so I'm very glad to have it in my collection again!!!
6305784116|5.0|[[ASIN:6305784116 The Aristocats (Disney Gold Classic Collection)]] The original version of Aristocats is simply wonderful.  We have watched it over and over with our grandchildren.  It is fun for them and fun for us.  They nearly always find something new in the very elaborate drawings.  The voices are marvelous, the story is delightful and there is just enough suspense for young children.  We cannot recommend this version enough.  It makes one realize how bland the Disney stories are--story, drawing, even the animation is far more sophisticated in this old version.  Jane and George Webb

B001PPLJIQ|3.0|Kate Winslet lends this film automatic star power, but the movie flounders because of two major flaws. First, there are at least four or five stories here, beginning with fifteen-year-old Michael Berg who has a summer love affair with Hanna Schmitz (Winslet) who is almost forty. Nearly an hour later, and without any warning, The Reader turns into a Holocaust film, with the attendant themes that you might expect. There are also deeply personal, moral, and legal twists that turn the film into a melodrama. What appears to be a minor subplot turns into an undeveloped major theme in the last minutes of the film. Finally, with the film flashing back and forth between Michael's obsession with his past, The Reader is a study of the power of memory to shape the present. The other major flaw is that these separate but related stories require a significant suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. The love affair is not the only twist that begs many complicated questions. The film is based upon the novel by Bernhard Schlink.
B000PC0WKG|5.0|I didn't think it fair to lower the star rating for a gripe about price, so I gave it five stars -- but, they are selling the dead tree version for $4.99 while still asking $9.99 for the Kindle version.  Tsk, tsk!!!!!!!
0307269752|4.0|The first half of the book drew me in, but then in the 2nd half the author seemed to take the easy way out and instead of allowing the action to unfold (in order for the mystery to be solved), it devolved into a Perry Mason episode where several people \\"monologued\\" (Yes, I did it and here's how and why... ).<br /><br />Also, this is a translation into English and in my humble opinion the writing style was uneven and mediocre.<br /><br />**** SPOILERS *****<br /><br />Also, after reading the first chapter of the book I guessed that it would turn out that the niece was still alive, so it was a bit unbelievable that everyone was so convinced that she was dead.  It's a bit of a stretch to believe that her killer would go to the trouble of sending a framed, pressed flower EVERY YEAR for decades!
B00111L0MY|4.0|There's a moment about 5 minutes into \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" when you think you might just have stumbled on a genuine masterpiece...<br /><br />As Casey Affleck ruminates in a weary beaten-up voiceover about good and evil and the life choices we make and how neighbourhoods shape us as people and those choices, the camera pans across the locals he's talking about and their Boston inner city terrain.<br /><br />These are real people in the real world - all manner of faces, colours and creeds - just going about their business - a man sat on the steps of a tenement building having a midday cigarette - kids of 8 and 9 flipping open their mobile phones - murals on walls declaring all sorts - a white father plops his baseball cap on the head of his gorgeous son of one who giggles, while a black father positions his equally gorgeous older son on the baseball circle in the local park with a sense of pride - all of it eventually making its way to a media circus outside a suburban home and a picture of a 9-year old girl on a tree...<br /><br />The opening minutes are full of these beautifully realised vignettes - the use of real Bostonians and their 'tough' suburbs adding a reality and power to Gone Baby Gone that is simply stunning - and that gritty reality continues throughout the film. And when you learn that the director is pretty boy Ben Affleck whom everyone loves to hate - you're more than impressed.<br /><br />But then of course it all goes to mush when the frankly ludicrously cherubic face of Casey Affleck appears with his equally drippy girlfriend Michelle Monaghan (an amazingly dull part for her) in tow beside him - they're the leads? We're expected to believe these dweebs?? While Casey is good in parts, he's out of his depth in others - and worse - a lot of the time you feel he's literally going to burst into a fit of the giggles at any moment. Monaghan is fabulous expressively as an actress, but her character Angie is a bit weedy and therefore difficult to care about - Angie seems almost superfluous to requirements (she was more fleshed out in the book).<br /><br />But then you ask yourself why did top quality actors like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris get involved in this movie - and the answer is the truly fabulous script adapted by Aaron Stockard from Denis Lehane's book of the same name. This is \\"Mystic River\\" territory - Lehane has worked in child abuse and abduction cases and knows his monsters and their families so well that his observations of them hurt you - literally. There are many scenes in this excellent film where I found myself tearful - and not always for the grotesque things that Miramax must show you about pervs and their ways - but for the humanity of the other people involved - an emotion that seems all too often missing from other films about this easy-to-exploit subject. Ben Affleck has imbibed his debut with genuine heart even if the story does go off the rails a bit towards the end.<br /><br />Given real meat to work with, the large varied cast is uniformly brilliant right down to even the smallest part - and just when you think you've seen all that Harris and Freeman have to give - they floor you - both of them - adding a gravitas throughout that must have had the older Affleck tingling in his Director's chair. John Ashton is superb too as Ed Harris' sidekick and Titus Welliver as the child's father Lionel who may or may not be a nice guy. But the big surprise is Amy Ryan (Oscar nominated) who plays the devious trailer-trash druggy mum Helen McCready whose daughter Amanda is the girl pictured everywhere and abducted. You hate her and yet empathise with her in equal measure - and you wonder (like Affleck's character does) should a 9-year old girl be back with this train wreck of a person - or does Helen McCready deserve a second chance at life like everyone else?  And who makes that decision?<br /><br />The Blu Ray print is surprisingly bad - speckled and blurry in the indoor and night scenes and hardly revelatory anywhere else. Also 2 of the special features cavalierly give away far too much of the plot and the twists - so don't watch either before you see the movie.  Also of note is David Buckley's tenderly evocative music, which gives many of the down and up scenes a hugely powerful lift.<br /><br />Despite being just a few notches short in places, \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is a superb film - a genuine sleeper from 2008 - and Ben Affleck has arrived as a Director - big time.<br /><br />I was moved, confused, hurt and left thinking about difficult decisions.<br /><br />Highly recommended.cavalierly give away far too much of the plot and the twists - so don't watch either before you see the movie.

032147404X|5.0|My sister sold me my first Digital SLR and she loaned me her copy of this book. She said it was the best around to help with the basics. After using hers for a month I purchased my own copy to have. This book is good for any digital camera owner who is starting out and would like to know some of the basics. Kelby has great ideas and lets you know some of the do's and do not's with equipment and other products as well as the best way to get certain shots with your camera. Good read.
0064430227|5.0|It's one of those totemic works that stands as a pillar of Western civilization.  The Sistine Chapel, Beethoven's Ninth, Harold and His Purple Crayon.  Really, there is something so beautfully small and (dare I say) zen-like about this story...quite extraordinary.  I have the feeling I could read it right now and be amazed, still.  Most important:  KIDS LOVE IT.
B001IU8RWY|5.0|Fifteen solid blistering tracks of just what all true long-time AC/DC fans will most likely eat up. I know I did. I care not what the disgrunted fans, the paid music critics, the nay-sayers might comment about 'Black Ice' - they're all wrong and I'm right. 'Black Ice' is a darn fine CD title from Angus Young and crew. I've thought about it and for the record, my all-time AC/DC favorite titles are 'Let There Be Rock', 'Powerage', 'Black In Black' and 'Fly On The Wall'. With that being said, I will most certainly keep my copy of 'Black Ice' in my -current rotation- stack for sometime to come. As for the tracks, simply couldn't get enough of the CD's single &#34;Rock And Roll Train&#34;, the total ass-kicking &#34;Big Jack&#34;, &#34;War Machine&#34; (really liked hearing this song performed live on their current tour), the snazzy &#34;She likes Rock 'N Roll&#34;, &#34;Rocking All The Way&#34; and the title cut &#34;Black Ice&#34;. Nice to know that one can purchase this CD for no more than $12 at any area Wal-Mart. Nice move.
B00127R7JM|5.0|Much more black metal on this album mixed with Ihsahn's current experimental metal and orchestral obsessions makes for one hell of a demonic ride. The catchiness is major plus to me, but I'm sure a lot of kvlt metal heads would think otherwise...
B001NFNFIK|2.0|Purchased for a friend of mine. The movie was in excellent condition as promised, she did not like the movie though.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|It is a riveting production of the type which grabs your attention, tugs at the heart, and of course forces you to examine the values you believe in, as you see how the loss or acquisition of wealth changes the characters.  I'm enjoying the viewing on PBS and on line as well. I will of course want to add the book to my reading list this summer.
1416550542|4.0|I had been waiting months to get my hands on Kate Morton's second novel & I was not disappointed. It's great, even better  than her first novelTHE HOUSE AT RIVERTON.

It does switch back and forth between several timelines just to keep you on your toes. Read it, savor it...you won't be sorry!
0711986746|5.0|So many of the reviewers of this book seem to want everything spelled out in capital letters.   Perhaps they have no nuances, no ability to read between the lines.   To me, this is definitely a read between the lines book.   This is not a capital letters book.   As for some of the criticisms about it, they just seem to me to rather miss the point.   Of course Peter isn't writing about what he doesn't know.   He didn't grow up with Freddie.   He was only with him in the role of personal assistant for the last decade or so of Freddie's life.   For the people who complained that Peter said nothing at all about Freddie's childhood, it seems perfectly obvious to me that Freddie went WAY out of his way to obliterate entirely that portion of his life---with Peter and  everyone else.   If a person does that, use your common sense---why would he unless his childhood was something he was embarrassed and/or ashamed about?   That's what I mean by reading between the lines.   For example, on page 208 of my paperback version, Peter gives in my opinion all the information you need to know about Freddie's relationship with his immediate family when he writes: \\"...by maintaining a distance from them, he was also able to protect himself from some of their censure.\\"   Censure?   That tells me volumes---that they disapproved of him in some ways.   Probably, although I don't know this for a fact, because they were a religious family, they disapproved of his sexuality choices.   It has been my experience that people who take organized religion very seriously are the most intolerant of those who choose to follow any path other that the one THEY have deemed correct.   The Scientologists and the religious right are good examples of this.         Put yourself in Freddie's shoes: here's an inordinately creatively gifted little boy from a restrictive highly religious family, who is shipped off to a boarding school---in another country!---from the age of eight until the age of sixteen, with only short holidays once a year to see his family members.  While at this boarding school, by Freddie's own admission, he was chased around by at least one schoolmaster.   \\"Chased around\\"---that suggests sexual abuse to me.   I know from my probation officer husband that frequently pedophiles congregate in those situations: Boy Scouts, boarding schools, all boys choirs, etc.   Now before someone gets a hernia from misinterpreting what I just said, I don't say that ALL people involved in those very worthwhile organizations are pedophiles, just that statistically, pedophiles are going to prey where the targets are.   So here's Freddie, shipped away from his family, who seem intolerant to me, to a rigid boarding school, which seems intolerant to me, to be on at least one occasion \\"chased\\" by a schoolmaster.   That poor, poor little boy!   And yet he must also have had some good from his family, because otherwise he would have cut them off entirely once he had the ability to do so.   He never did.        Peter writes sensitively and insightfully about Freddie's behaviour.   He does I think zero in on the fact that, for whatever reason, Freddie had to have some sort of drama to release his creativity.  As Peter so well put it, \\"He had to sing angry.\\"   Anger, as any artist knows, is closely related to sex and sometimes even to inspiration.   Most of the time this spark to creativity seems to have taken the form of Freddie picking arguments with lovers, although with the Bill Reid incident, physical violence erupted in the form of Bill actually biting Freddie on the hand.   Ouch!   Thank God Freddie dropped that idiot shortly thereafter.         With regard to people being bored to death by the careful descriptions of Freddie's Garden Lodge estate, again I think they are missing the point.   The descriptions of the things Freddie bought and how he decorated tell you volumes about the man.   His furnishings tell you Freddie was tasteful, picky, careful, unencumbered by alack of money like most of us, and very much into controlling his environment.   He was into creating pictures, whether they be of a song on a Queen show, or exactly the right painting on the right wall to bring out the exact mood he wanted.   Peter shows us that Freddie was an artist and a collector, and nowhere in the book does he state this so well as when he writes something to the effect of, \\"Freddie was a collector, of things and of people.\\"         The Freddie Mercury I came to know from reading this book was a highly gifted creative man, who had an enormous sexual appetite, a complete and utter devotion to the people who had proved themselves to be his real friends, and a man with absolutely no middles whatsoever.   He was either embarrassed or ashamed of his origins and tried to hide them all his adult life, but not to the extent of denying his family once he became a huge star, although he was careful to keep his interactions with them on his own terms.   He seemed to me to be extremely funny and extremely sensitive to slights both real and imagined.  In addition, he seemed to be someone who went to great pains most of the time never to delve into his own psyche---and in order to avoid doing so, he surrounded himself with virtually non-stop activity.   He seemed to have a gigantic capacity for fun and an equally gigantic capacity to be hurt.   He hated confrontation and loved Mary Austin, Peter Freestone, Joe Fanelli, Jim Hutton, and all of his many cats, but each of them in deliberately separate and different ways.   He seemed to me to be a master of compartmentalization, much like President John F. Kennedy, in that no one person, with the possible exception of Mary Austin, ever got the fully exposed, fully vulnerable Farrokh Borni Bulsara---pronounced FARR-oke.  (That's the way his mother pronounced his name on the documentary I saw, and she should know.)   And lastly, he seemed to me to be secretive, not necessarily because he was intrinsically that way, but because he learned through painful experience that that was how to protect himself.        I consider Peter Freestone's book to be excellent---as long as you can read between the lines.

0783233477|4.0|Death decides that he (she? it?) wants to experience life as a human being.  He also wants a good tour guide.  Death starts tracking William Parrish, an uber-wealthy, but apparently also uber good and moral and ethical businessman.  When Bill Parrish's heart starts moving towards the final heart attack, Death inhabits Brad Pitt's body and gives Mr. Parrish a deal - as long as Death is entertained by Mr. Parrish, Death won't take Mr. Parrish to the great beyond.<br /><br />Parrish is played by Anthony Hopkins, just a few years removed from \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"The Remains of the Day\\".  This performance is critical to the movie, because you have to believe that with Kings and Queens and Captains of Science and Industry to choose from, Death would finally choose a guided tour from Bill Parrish than from, say, Gandhi or Bill Gates or Abraham Lincoln.<br /><br />Parrish has two daughters.  Marcia Gay Harden is Allison, the eldest daughter who is married to Jeffrey Tambor as Quince, an executive at Bill's company.  Allison is type A and is putting the finishing touches on Bill's sixty-fifth birthday party - the kind of party with hundreds of guests that include the President.  Quince is believable both as the kind of man who'd be married to Allison, as well as the kind of man who'd be on Bill's board of directors by merit rather than nepotism.<br /><br />The second daughter is Susan, an Internal Medicine resident played by Claire Forlani.  Susan is probably going to marry Drew, who is the Shark at Bill's company, and although Bill likes Drew at his company, he thinks that Susan should wait for lightning to strike rather than marry Drew because it seems a good match.<br /><br />Susan met the man owning the Brad Pitt body at a coffee shop soon after getting the \\"lightning strike\\" advice from her father, and in a lengthy, drawn out scene, you get the idea that both Susan and the Brad Pitt Coffee Shop guy think lightning may be striking.<br /><br />When Susan meets Death later on she is taken aback, not because she knows she is speaking to Death, but because the man with the Brad Pitt looks seems different from the man at the coffee shop.<br /><br />After Death tells Bill the \\"rules\\" of their arrangement Bill realizes he can't just walk around and say \\"hello... I'd like you to meet my new friend, Death...\\" and improvises the name \\"Joe Black\\".<br /><br />Many stories depend on the transformation of their characters, and sometimes one transformation is enough for a good story.

B000000OY9|5.0|I don't understand all the bad reviews for this other than, sure, it does *not* sound like a \\"typical\\" Neil Young release.  But as we've seen over the years, Young does dabble in other styles as well.  I think this is a good representation of that.
B001N26GFC|4.0|Happy-Go-Lucky stars Sally Hawkins as Poppy, a 30 year old London elementary school teacher who is so cheerful she makes Pollyanna look like Eeyore.<br /><br />The film doesn't follow any Hollywood formula, so here is fair advance warning.  You may not like \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" if:<br />1. You dislike \\"British Humor\\".<br />2. You have difficulty following non-American English.<br />3. You dislike films without a definite or obvious \\"plot\\".<br /><br />There is a decidedly British genre that I would loosely describe as \\"get a handful of interesting characters together and follow them a few days\\". (I recently watched \\"The Station Agent\\" and although the characters and setting were different, it shares this genre.)<br /><br />Poppy isn't just cheerful.  She finds almost any situation a suitable one for a joke and a laugh.  In the opening she rides her bicycle to a bookstore where she tries unsuccessfully to get the attention of the bearded young man who works there.  She goes outside to discover her bicycle has been stolen.  She is disappointed and says \\"I didn't even get to say good-bye!\\"<br /><br />The stolen bike leads Poppy to decide to take driving lessons.  She hires the increasingly serious and severely humorless Scott, played by Eddie Marsan.  Some of the funniest scenes in the film and certainly the most serious one take place during Poppy's driving lessons.<br /><br />Poppy has shared a flat with Zoe for ten years, and she has two younger sisters who don't share her irrepressible cheery disposition.<br /><br />I could give you the entire \\"plot\\" and although I wouldn't be giving you many \\"spoilers\\", I also wouldn't be giving you much encouragement to watch the movie.<br /><br />The Mrs. and I laughed out loud several times.  Go back to my short list of disqualifiers.  If you're NOT disqualified, you might like it.
B001N18HOQ|4.0|When I got to know this new edition included the MTV Unplugged I clicked on the purchase now button inmediately. The packaging is excellent, very good edition with some really cool pics. Haven't pay a lot of attention to the Redux Ten yet but it sounds a little bit different. About the DVD, it's amazing, nice video quality and perfect sound quality. Amazing show, I don't know why it took so many years to release it.
B001MYIXAC|3.0|I liked this movie fine but there's really nothing new here other than the fact that the leads are kids instead of adults.  Visually its very haunting and beautiful and had I discovered it by accident one late night then I think I would have loved it.  The reviews for this thing have been way too generous and it really built up my hopes.  Its not a masterpiece but it is a pretty good Vampire film.  For all its hype its really just a slightly new take on the same moody and depressed vampire story that You've seen many times before.  Its worth seeing but certainly not the best Vampire film ever.
0198326769|3.0|THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS is told from a 9-year-old boy's point of view, which made it a boring read for me. I understand it was written for young adults, but I still wanted it to include more details to compliment what I already know about The Holocaust. (By the way, did you know the word holocaust comes from \\"holókaustos,\\" which means burnt whole? I didn't.) Even though I didn't much care for this book, I hope it spurs young adults to dig deep and learn more about World War II and The Holocaust.     Note: See the movie based on this book. It's beautifully filmed as well as compelling.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|There are some excellent detailed reviews, so I'll add my subjective impressions:     I never heard of Steven Wilson, or Porcupine Tree for that matter. I bought this because I saw it with a DVD Audio disc and I love the sound from that format.    What a surprise....    This is, without hyperbole, one of the best albums I've ever heard. Moody, industrial, beautiful, melodic, quiet, then hard & heavy - it's a mix of catchy songwriting, industrial, atmospheric, rock, and other styles that just work together so well.     After a month, this disc has just grown and grown on me. If you like vinyl, you can try to get the limited edition 2 LP album from BurningShed. The 4 x 10\\" LP set are sold out and selling for a mint on eBay if you're lucky enough to find one.    If you like Floyd, Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails/Trent Reznor then give this album a try and listen more than once. I can only give it my highest recommendation. And the DVD-Audio does sound excellent as well.

006113127X|4.0|This is pretty typical Bukowski. As with most of what he wrote its supposed to be loosely based on his real life experiences. If you can get beyond his annoying habit of trying to convince you of how tough he is and exagerrating if not out and out lying about the frequency of his sexual encounters and the quality of the women involved then its a good quick read for a laugh. The best stuff in this is his humorous accounts of working various disposable menial jobs. Bukowski is very funny, a fact which seems to get lost in the shuffle by the lame hipsters who comprise the bulk of the fans of his work.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|This is the response to Alex Proyas's \\"Dark City.\\" What if you go from a small patch of light into hell? Darren Aronofsky repeats his seven-rapid-repeated shots technique from Pi in this painful film, \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" adapted from a story by Hubert Selby Jr. by Selby and Aronofsky. He also plays tribute to the shot of Jennifer Connelly at the end of a pier from Proyas's \\"Dark City\\" (it is even the same pier).<br /><br />The film is painful to watch, but difficult to call \\"beautiful,\\" for it fails to say anything new. Its soul message: drug addiction dehumanizes you and kills relationships. This film documents four character's abandonment of hope, and ends at the twilight of their despair.<br /><br />The four principal actors do excellent jobs, and in a better world Ellen Burstyn's performance would have been carved out of this film's context and awarded an Oscar. Jennifer Connelly also delivers an excellent understated performance of how drug addiction can affect the shallow.<br /><br />Sara Goldfarb (Burstyn) is a lonely widow who has invested all her dreams in the success of her worthless son Harry (Jared Leto), and passes her days fixed on television. In a dream of some self-fulfillment, she hopes to go on television herself, and begins a prescription drug diet plan at the hands of an unscrupulous doctor. Hell follows, and Burstyn's performance is so realistic you will weep real tears.<br /><br />Harry is a wastrel crack fiend with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) (her attraction to the colorless Harry is never explained, and to me is unlikely). Harry has a moment of limited insight and becomes an entrepreneur on the crack scene, with predictable results. But his intentions are good: he is trying to finance a store to feature clothes designed by Marion.<br /><br />The setting is Brooklyn Beach and the collection of lower middle class second generation Jewish immigrants and their widows clinging to the old neighborhood (look for Louise Lasser in a cameo role).

B000EQ47HC|4.0|Boston (or Tom) had 10 years to perfect their debut album, and only 10 months to produce this followup. Many were disappointed by this effort, but very few bands have ever made back to back classic albums only a year apart. Zep did it, AC/DC has done it, the Beatles, Aerosmith, the Stones and maybe a few others.    Boston got so big, so fast, they were launched into that tier of arena rock stardom before they were ready, and suffered from unreasonable expectations.    Having said all that, this album is still a classic, and a must have for any real Boston fan. This remastered version is one of the few digitally remastered records from the 70's that actually sound better with the new technology. This is partly because Boston never buried any imperfections under an analog \\"wall of sound\\", and partly because Tom was so heavily involved in this remaster.     I'd recommend this to a Boston fan, but a casual 70's rock fan would probably be better off downloading the title track off a music download service.

I love the way she keeps you moving, and the high impact aerobics are usually just 30 seconds, so I tell myself I can do almost anything for 30 seconds - before you know it, you're  moving on.

B001P5Q6F2|2.0|I have been a LOG fan since I first heard As The Palaces Burn, and have bought all cd's since...except for this one. I heard the first singles ( Set to Fail and Contractor) and was not impressed. However, I did give the album a chance beyond those two by listening to it in its entirety when they streamed it on their myspace,  and to my disappointment, it didn't get any better. As a metal album, sure it's good, at best, but as a Lamb of God album, it really let me down. In my opinion, there were no real memorable songs, and the ones that were sounded like they should have been on Sacrament. It could be that they have a sweet record deal, and have made their money and don't care as much about heavy and brutal anymore, it could be that they had fans vote and choose on which parts should be included on the album, or it could just be a road block in their careers. Who knows?
0141439475|5.0|Chapter 14 should have been cauterized. There you are, engrossed in the monster's struggle for love, acceptance,  and identity, and then Shelly stitches on an extra appendage--kinda like Victor Frankenstein sewing a hand or foot onto the monster's back--a convoluted back story of how Felix, one of the cottagers, saves and elopes with Safie, a Turkish-Arabian love interest. Chapter 14  does absolutely nothing for the story, save provide a means for the creature's learning to speak and read. (In one movie version, Branagh's, the cottagers are simply teaching their own children to read and write, which further strikes at the core of the monster's suffering. I disliked the movie, though.) Chapter 14, I can't stand it!  It could have and should have been reworked, but it wasn't. Still, this is one of the greatest explorations of what Jung called \\"The Shadow.\\"

0375758992|4.0|I had heard so much about this book so when I saw it lying on the table at Borders not too long ago, I picked it up. When I finally did get to start reading it, I was almost put off by the dark humor that Fuller had while writing this book. I slugged through the pages until all of a sudden, I realize that the end was near and I find myself not wanting to finish the book.     It is dark. It is intoxicating (I have never consumed as much liquor as the Fullers did). It is disturbing. It is chaotic. It is of an Africa I have never known of. I know that Europeans had a stranglehold grip on Africans for years, but I have never read of the ruling class being banned from their homes because the Africans took back the ruling reins. It is of a different viewpoint, that's for sure. Alexandra Fuller has taken me on a journey of her childhood with dark humor, love, laughter, sorrow and joy as she described her childhood through childish eyes. Her sibling rivalry with her sister sound just like mine with my siblings. Only, I lived in America, whereas Fuller lived in Africa and among bugs, animals, starvation, dirty water, malaria, prejudice and more.     This is a very detailed memoir of a childhood spent in Africa and Fuller will take you along for the ride, sometimes with glee and sometimes with madness. Either way, the reader is going to experience Africa right along with the Fullers in every sense of the word. Life elsewhere has got to seem tame for them.    The writing style can be jerky at times, but it is worth the read. It would also be a perfect book for a bookclub discussion, so take a chance and read it. It is definitely unforgettable.    4/20/09
B000AMJC2K|5.0|i've been looking for something like this for a long time.  everything i found was much more expensive and completely out of my range.  this was CHEAP, easy to mount to my desk, holds my monitor securely, and most importantly, moved in all the ways that I want it to!  i can lean back and bring my monitor with me.  any angle i want.  the only slight problem is that the plastic pieces that hold the cords come apart when you are adding or removing cords, but they stay when you aren't messing with them and the only time to play with the cords is when setting up the monitor, so...  amazing functionality and awesome price. 5 stars!!!
1402210795|5.0|I won't go into the plot as so many others have, but I found this book to be a fun read.  What really impressed me about it is that it led me to love a hero who seemed beyond redemption.  From what I've read, Ms. Heyer does remind me of Jane Austen, except that her heros are a bit more vain and/or impulsive.  Still, it was delightful to read and I will be reading all of the Heyer books I come across in the future.
B001HBX8NC|5.0|For many opera fans the favourite Rigoletto on dvd remains the 1983 film version starring the young Pavarotti as the dashing Duke, his irrepressible singing and high spirits contrasting sharply with the gut wrenching wretchedness of the jester played by Wixell almost to perfection,and of course the inimitable Gruberova as Gilda the jester's daughter.(For me this together with the Domingo/Migenes 'Carmen', and the Domingo/Stratas 'La Traviata' represents the best of opera films). Now comes the 2006 production of Rigoletto, staged by the Zurich Opera House with Chorus and Orchestra wonderfully conducted by Santi, recorded in High-Definition and transfered to an Arthaus Blu Ray disc of breathtaking quality. I'm not exaggerating. Even by today's Hi-Def standards, the picture quality here is simply stunning: inky blackness, realistic night time scenes accurately rendered with proper light and shadow effects, atmospheric blue lighting, and the sets and costumes show up in vivid pop-up colours with razor sharp contrasts. The audio is no less exemplary, with the DTS HD MA 7.1 presenting a wide and believable soundstage within which the singers' voices are clearly 'imaged'. No balance problems here. In fact, this disc is technically a near reference recording which will warm the hearts of audiopliles and videophiles everywhere. But what about the performance itself? Well, here Leo Nucci steals the show, his rich and dark-toned voice and excellent vocal characterisation both satisfy and convince. In Act 1, he is the cynical court jester and is nasty cockiness personified. Come Act 2, his is the voice of the enraged father hell bent on vengeance against his Duke and in the final Act we hear the sobs of a broken man cradling his dying daughter Gilda. The downward metamorphosis is  heartbreaking and the human degradation devastating. Elena Musoc whilst not in the same league as Gruberova in coloratura, sings beautifully and in many ways fills the role of the tragic daughter better. Of course the cherry in the pie of the film version is Pavarotti's high octane rendition of \\"La donna e mobile\\", whereas here the Duke(Piotr Beczala) is much less flamboyant and tosses off the famous aria in an almost casual style without much of the spotlight, which suits me fine, but most fans would find Pavarotti's approach irresistible. Overall the film version gives an impression of more dynamism and visual excitement, in part due to the relative freedom of film-making versus the physical confines of the traditional stage, but this by no means suggest that the Zurich version is somehow static or staid. Far from it. This version scores in its intimate telling of a harrowing tragedy and the depths of human suffering, is as well acted and sung as the other without the superstar names, and in the video and audio department is streets ahead of the older film. This superiority greatly enhances the viewing pleasure. Even if you have the film version, I would still highly recommend this Zurich production to you. Truly this is a 5 star disc. Enjoy!!er.

1416550534|5.0|A haunting story set before and during the 1920's.  It draws a nice comparison between the lives of the have's (Hannah and Emmeline) and the have nots (Grace).  I think that the novel starts somewhat slow due to this character development, but later there are so many twists and turns that you have to \\"hold on for the ride\\".  I really loved it!  I can picture this book at the movies starring Cate Blanchett as Hannah, Keira Knightley as Emmeline, Rachael McAdams as Grace, and Jude Law as Robbie.  How about that line up?!
B001EN71DG|5.0|I will try to keep this review terse. (long-winded blow-hard like me? HA!)<br /><br />There is a night-and-day difference between this set and its counterpart. Yes, it looks dated in spots. Yes, the green-screen effects occaisionally throw a glitch into the works. And yes, the non-human characters look like puppets and costumes, but the original releases are of a much higher caliber than the new ones. Maybe it's just how old I am, what I am used to, but Episodes IV through VI, are just better movies, period.<br /><br />Anakin Skywalker is now in full Darth Vader mode, drunk with power, and his offspring, Leia and Luke are leading an organization set on overthrowing his regime. As with its precursor, you must take the time to sit through all three installments to better grasp the story, but each does hold up on its own.<br /><br />Again, maybe it's my age group, but I think the outer space visuals are phenomenal. And the scenery is more what I imagine a life-friendly place to look like. And, having characters actually in front of the camera, does hold a tactile sensation that the digital age seems to be bent on undoing. But old meets new here, as some segments of the older films are occaisionally given CGI treatments. Done sparingly, it works beautifully. Done to excess, it is just sterile. It could have been helpful to use the advent of CGI to make the puppet characters' facial expressions more life-like. They seemingly spared no expense in putting out the new and re-issuing the old, so why not?<br /><br />But, as I have said, my bias leans heavily on this box, instead of the other. And sitting through all of it, is like watching a movie that is almost 15 hours long. Don't do this often, or it will wear you down...<br /><br />\\"...May the Force be with you...\\"

B000065U1N|5.0|Last night I saw this movie for the probably fifth time, and still I can't find any flaw in it, for me it is probably the best war movie ever made even though the story is about a relatively minor engagement in an already forgotten police action in a backwater country as Somalia.<br /><br />There are many strong characters but what stands out for me are the exchanges between the characters of Hoot(Eric Bana) and Eversman (Josh Harnett).  Hoot is the quintescential warrior, a Delta Forces sargeant that has seen it all, he convines experience with talent and a strong intellect.  Eversman is a young man thrown before his time to the burdens of command as his team leader suffers a seizure and cannot continue leading his chalk.  The exchanges between these two characters for me are the main part of the movie. Hoot counsels the younger warrior, he demands focus and getting the mission done before letting anguish and guilt take over, his men need him in all his capacity.  Eversman grows as a leader and a man as the combat progresses, at the begining he is willing to endager his team and mission to save a young member of his chalk but at the end he thinks and reacts more in the interest and welfare of the entire platoon.  Hoots's charge through the middle of the city to reach (although late) the crash site of the second Black Hawk and then getting in time to save Eversman's team from a recoiless rifle team at the scene of the main crash site is probably the strongest part of the movie in the action/heroics department.<br /><br />The movie is about a small group of dedicated and highly trained US Special Forces and Rangers took on thousands of fanatical militias (who are also high on drugs and bloodlust) to uphold the creed that no body should be left behind after accomplishing a presumably worthwhile mission that in the end was poorly planned.  It was the cammaraderie, training and ethos of these soldiers that ultimately saved the day.<br /><br />The battle of Mogadishu should be remenber by the sheer technical capacity and heroic selflesness that the US soldier is capable to bring to battle, I think this movie portrays and gives a fitting homage to these brave men.<br /><br />About the movie in itself the battle action puts you literally in the middle of the events, you can appreciate also the flaws on technology and chain of command decisions when the land convoy is shot to pieces while trying to reach the crash site due to lags in the relay of orders.<br /><br />The music was also very enjoyable.  I especially liked the rendition of The Minstrel Boy as performed by The Mescaleros, I thought it was very appropriate for the end credits of this movie.heer technical capacity and heroic selflesness that the US soldier is capable to bring to battle, I think this movie portrays and gives a fitting homage to these brave men.

0553103547|5.0|From the very first chapter this book will suck you into it's world.  The characters are varied and interesting.

George R. R. Martin has written a masterpiece.
0143035711|5.0|I first read this book years ago, and it is without a doubt one of the best war memoirs on my shelf and one to which I regularly return (as I just did for the third time, to read during a lengthy trip abroad).      The book recounts the training and duty tour of Robert Mason, a helicopter pilot who served in the air cav during the height of the Vietnam conflict.  Many consider it the best book written by a Vietnam vet and I would be inclined to agree (the only close contender would be the sniper memoirs of Carlos Hathcock, penned by Charles Henderson).  Chickenhawk is compelling from start to finish.    For one thing, Mason's book contains one of the few really interesting accounts of military training written to date--in Mason's case, of his helicopter flight training. In fact, the first section of the book is so vividly descriptive of the mechanics and procedures of military flight instruction that you finish it believing you could almost fly a helicopter yourself. (To appreciate fully Mason's accomplishment in rendering this experience so fascinating, one need only contrast it with that of Marcus Lutrell's recent \\"Lone Survivor,\\" which manages to turn what should be an equally fascinating account of Navy SEAL training into one of the most annoying and sleep-inducing chronicles of push-ups and special ops ever written). And once Mason starts recounting his actual combat experiences, you simply can't put the book down.     Partly what makes Chickenhawk such a unforgettable read is that Mason makes no effort either to doctor the facts about his time in Vietnam, his love of flying (even in combat), or about his own flaws and failures.  This is no boastful attempt to paint himself a hero (though among the heroes of that war, Mason is surely one), but a gut-wrenching look into a soldier's soul and the soul of a nation at war.  The result is one of the most stunning books about war ever written--and I've read hundreds.  And I will certainly read this one many times more.
B001PPLIFU|1.0|This senseless, pointless and ultimately disappointing followup to the fabulous Casino Royale is so bad of a movie that I am shocked at any positive reviews.      Firstly, Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond. With all due respect to Sean Connery,  I think Craig brings a level of seriousness, physicality and realism to the role that it has never had. Plus he looks great in his suits. He is certainly not the problem.      The movie started off well enough, and overall the action scenes, except for the plane jump scene, were well executed and pretty good. But the ridiculous storyline about wanting to control the some water supply is just so weak and contrived that I wondered if it was just some kind of plot head-fake and that the true evil plan was going to be revealed later on. But then the movie was over. What a joke. When you think of all the dangers we face in the real world is this the best the scriptwriters could come up with? Maybe they didn't want to offend real criminals. I could be wrong on this, because I am not a \\"Bond Expert\\", but this might be the first Bond movie without a memorable arch enemy of any kind. In fact there is nothing memorable about this movie. The only thing that stayed with me was how horrible it was. There was no great dialog. No romance. And it's humorless. Worst of all, there is no sense of intrigue or mystery here. Nothing but nice filler action scenes that leave the movie lacking any depth.     The more I thought about it the more this movie seemed like a third, maybe 'fourth', act for Casino Royale. Which is what I think was intended. A sequel in the true sense of the word. But, unlike the fabulous Kill Bill 2, it lacks the cohesion, strong enough plot-line and characters to make it stand-alone as unique single movie. The result is a mish-mosh of a movie that tries to use intermittent action to drive the plot while leaving the story behind.      The makers of this movie should really be ashamed of themselves, but the apparent profitsfrom this truly awful, awful movie will most likely prevent that kind of critical self-examination. This was a real Quantum of Nothing.
0316044695|2.0|I really wanted to like this book.  Half a dozen of my immediate family members are currently serving or have served in the military--as foot soldiers, a medic, an MP, a bombardier, and even as the lieutenant colonel commanding a missile battalion.  So, I have nothing but respect for our brave men and women in uniform.  And Operation Redwing, the 2005 mission that led to the largest loss of life in SEAL history, is the famous incident at the heart of this book.  How could an account of that operation and SEAL team 10 turn out to be anything less than absolutely gripping?  Well, Marcus Luttrell and his co-author managed to find a way.  Except for the last part of the book, the part that details the actual operation and its heartbreaking aftermath, Luttrell's \\"Lone Survivor\\" manages to turn what should have been a fascinating account of Navy SEAL training and operations into one of the most annoying, propagandistic and sleep-inducing chronicles of push-ups and special ops ever written.     The first 80 pages are an autobiographical rant, wherein Luttrell's sole apparent purpose is to convince us that a liberal press is to blame for all our nation's woes, that no soldiers ever to enter combat were/are better than SEALs, and that no Navy SEAL is better than Luttrell himself.     The second 80 pages recount in mind-numbing detail his every splash in the cold Pacific, his every roll in the sand, his every push-up and lung-bursting run across the beach, his every victory over other SEAL wannabes.  And no one does it better than Luttrell, of course, who manages a stab at self-promotion even when he's ostensibly praising others.  Most war memoirs draw you into the life of the storyteller, but you plod your way through the first two-thirds of this book thinking, \\"enough already--let's hear about the mission!\\"     Perhaps some of the blame should go to Patrick Robinson, a mediocre war novelist who apparently did most of the actual writing.  But whomever is to blame, if you want to know what happened to SEAL team 10 (and if you think you can actually trust this politically slanted account), then check the book out from your local library and skip straight to the last third.  Don't waste your money buying it.  Better yet, read Dick Winters' \\"Beyond Band of Brothers,\\" a war memoir by an intelligent and self-effacing war hero.  Or if an Iraq War special ops memoir is specifically what you're looking for, read SAS Andy McNab's \\"Bravo Two Zero,\\" which does everything Luttrell's book wanted to do but does it far, far better.     While I have no doubt Luttrell is a tough and well-intentioned soldier, his writing skills and extremist opinions leave something to be desired.

B000I0QKDS|4.0|The first version of the Jeff Beck Group existed in a transitional period in time, before bands like The Faces and Led Zeppelin came into being, and after Jeff Beck's ejection from the Yardbirds. It's all in the timing because it also followed the folding of bands like the Shotgun Express and the Birds, from which he recruited Rod Stewart and Ron Wood, then both still relatively unknown. Mick Waller on drums had known Rod Stewart from earlier Steampacket days and came to the band from the Brian Auger Trinity.<br /><br />Truth was the first album by the group although it was released under the name Jeff Beck, who was simultaneously \\"enjoying\\" a solo career, masterminded by producer Mickie Most, and having hits with songs such as Hi Ho Silver Lining, Tallyman and Love Is Blue (shudder).<br /><br />The truer heart of Jeff Beck was to be found on the B-sides and on this debut album, which was mostly left to Ken Scott, the engineer, to handle, whilst Mickie Most no doubt dreamt of one day discovering elfin girls in black leather cat suits with bass guitars.<br /><br />After eighteen months of grafting on the road the band were pretty hot. It is a classic album, though the shortage of material does show, with versions of Ol' Man River and a throwaway filler in Greensleeves. This was inspired by Chet Atkins' version, though Mick Waller had previously recorded a rocked-up version of it for Joe Meek with the Flee-Rekkers back in 1960 as Green Jeans. Carrying on that tradition, several of the tracks are thinly disguised rewrites of well-known blues songs. Let Me Love You is essentially Buddy Guy's Let Me Love You Baby; Rock My Plimsoul is clearly BB King's Rock Me Baby (although BB himself nicked it from Lil' Son Jackson) and Blues De Luxe owes more than a little to BB's Gambling Blues.<br /><br />There's also a reworking of Shapes Of Things, a Yardbirds hit that Jeff played on; a cover of Tim Rose's arrangement of Morning Dew; a version of Muddy Waters' You Shook Me with John Paul Jones (soon to be of Led Zeppelin) guesting on Hammond; and a rip-roaring rendition of Willie Dixon's I Ain't Superstitious, as recorded by the great Howlin' Wolf.<br /><br />The album set a sort of blueprint for a genre that came to be known as heavy rock, made possible by developments in the technology of electrical musical instruments, amplification and recording equipment, of which Jeff and his sidemen were early adopters and experimenters. In the Yardbirds, of course, he had been a pioneer of feedback. The sound was developed on the second album, [[ASIN:B000I0QKDI Beck-Ola]], but with less light and shade than is found on Truth.<br /><br />Rounding out the album is the instrumental Beck's Bolero, an earlier recording from July 1966. It had previously appeared on the B-side of Hi Ho Silver Lining and has the unique line-up supporting Jeff of Jimmy Page (12-string electric guitar), Nicky Hopkins (keyboards), John Paul Jones (bass) and Keith Moon (drums)! The tune is credited to Jimmy Page, though Maurice Ravel may have had a hand in it. On the album it is shorn of the backwards guitar part at the end but is newly mixed into rudimentary stereo.<br /><br />This edition of the CD comes with 16 pages of booklet notes including an informative essay by Charles Shaar Murray, and a number of bonus tracks (all stereo except where stated): I've Been Drinking had been the B-side of Love Is Blue, and so was unlikely to have been heard by legions of Jeff Beck fans who would have avoided the single like the plague, and was an adaptation of Dinah Washington's Drinking Again. There are the first takes of All Shook Up and Blues De Luxe, the latter without the fake live effects that were overdubbed to the eventual master; the excellent 1967 single Tallyman (in mono) and its B-side, an earlier recording of Rock My Plimsoul, both from a time when Aynsley Dunbar was the drummer; and Hi Ho Silver Lining, first recorded by the Attack, and its B-side, the original mono, backwardguitar mix of Bolero.<br /><br />Finally, it includes the dreaded Love Is Blue (in mono). Where to begin with this blot in Jeff Beck's discography? It began life as L'Amour Est Bleu by the Paul Mauriat Orchestra, and with words added became Luxembourg's 1967 entry in the Eurovision Song Contest as sung by Vicky Leandros. It came fourth but was popular enough to be recorded by the likes of Andy Williams and Claudine Longet. It falls way outside Jeff Beck's comfort zone and suggests that Mickie Most must have had a very persuasive tongue.aded Love Is Blue (in mono).

B001NFNFNU|5.0|This is film making at its Very BEST!! It's all at once touching, infuriating,  empowering, and immensely compelling!!<br /><br />It's a true story and not just \\"based\\" on a true story. Collins refused to be silenced or ignored, and with the help of some key figures, she took on one of the most shameful cases of police corruption in Los Angeles history.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie gives a rivetting and stunning performance as Collins, an honest, caring woman who was clearly striving for independence in a male-dominated society. She works diligently as the supervisor for a telephone company, so much so that she's offered a managerial position.  As a single mother, she's firm yet nurturing, and she's upfront with her son.<br /><br />After her son Walter's disappearance, and after the wrong boy is returned to her, she initially faces the LAPD on her own, which leaves her with little since it's a tyrannical system motivated by lust for power, not justice.<br /><br />The authority figures in this film are by far the most deplorable. They are obstinate and domineering, bullying Collins into taking in an imposter child.  Frequently displaying the nerve to question Collins as a mother, claiming she was so happy her son was taken and that she's now resorting to phony accusations. Her insistence that they carry on the investigation lands her in a dehumanizing psychiatric hospital, where numerous strong-willed women labelled by the system as \\"disruptive\\"  are sent to endure constant medicating, abuse and cruel electroshock therapy.<br /><br />The only person on Collins' side is Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), a Presbyterian minister and community activist who made it his life's mission to expose the deep and widespread corruption of the L.A.P.D during radio sermons.<br />When Collins was committed, Briegleb took it upon himself to publicize the disappearance of her son and rally the public to support her. This put tremendous pressure on the LAPD, as did the concurrent discovery of a crime scene; buried beneath a chicken ranch in Wineville, California are human remains. A mechanic named Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) becomes the primary suspect in a string of murders.<br /><br />Indeed, a lot of what Collins goes through is so outrageous that it's  deeply disturbing. Indeed...Thought provoking, intriguing, intense. I was Compelled to watch it again and again. A FEMINIST Triumph!!<br /><br />I salute Clint Eastwood as the greatest ALL round talent in Hollywood.icken ranch in Wineville, California are human remains.

1439138311|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading \\"Brooklyn.\\"  Colm Toibin's writing style drew me into the story and made me feel like as if I were actually there at times. Tobin's discriptions of the characters, scenes, and action taking place are so vivid my mind created a wonderful movie to go along with the words I read. I could almost hear the voices of the characters and the sounds around them, the smells, the feel of the air. Each of the characters in the book are wonderful, each in their own way. I cared about them in such a way while reading I forgot they were just characters in a book and not people I knew. Only falling asleep, the ring of my telephone, or the buzz of the doorbell brought me back to my time and place in the universe. The only negative thing I have to say about \\"Brooklyn\\" is, at one point, I reached the end of the final page hungering for more.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|This very modern spin on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is both brilliant and funny.  Jemima Rooper is a fiesty 21st century Austen fan who suddenly finds herself in the middle of her favorite novel. Her attempts to keep the plot of the novel on track are amusing and touching.  Elliot Cowan's Darcy seems a bit too stiff, even for Darcy. The supporting actors are all very good.  Much like Austen's own writing, the dialogue is fast and witty.    I am a long time Austen fan and love that this series does not hesitate to tweak and alter some of the core characters and events within the novel.  My favorite changes involve the \\"truths\\" about Wickham.  I've spoken to a few other Austen followers who don't like the liberties that ITV takes with characters and plot.  Some viewers might be shocked by an annuled marriage, references to lesbianism, and the radical alteration to the ending we've known and loved for two centuries.  I found the proposed annulment to be rather unbelievable, but I'm willing to suspend some reality in a movie that's already asked me to accept time travel into a fictional book.    I watched all four episodes straight through, and I'm going to buy the DVD.  If you're willing to watch some big changes to Austen's novel, I highly recommend this laugh-out-loud program.

It is Luttrell's personal account and in his voice.  Getting an up close and personal perspective of the American heroes and Marcus' miraculous journey of survival made the book exceptional. Clearly, God must have a special plan for this man.      Marcus Luttrell honors his fallen comrades very well.  Thank you for your service and your devotion, duty, and convictions.      We should all honor and support our amazing military soldiers.      I borrowed the book from the library, but I am going to have to purchase the book, as well as buy several to give away.  Everyone should read this book.

My 9 year old daughter was given this as a present, and has been both savoring the stories herself (all about various animals, the first on Peter Rabbit is a classic) as well as reading them to younger siblings.  Its sort of heavy for a small kid, and recommended as something special to be read on special occasions, not to sit down and read the whole book at once.

So I often find myself going to buy new copies, around this time the Greatest hits was released. I was more then a little disappointed, more then three of the song choosen were covers. Popular songs like Night train and Rocket Queen were excluded. So people who didn't grow up listening to GNR don't get the full experience. I recommend for newbies just to get appetite.

My setup:  Sony Blu-Ray player BDP-S550  Sony Bravia 46\\" LCD  Bose 5.1 speakers (I'm not much of an audiophile but I thought the sound was much improved as well.)

I'm not sure what their setup is but it looks gorgeous on mine!    \\"You mistake me, my dear. I have the utmost respect for your nerves. They've been my constant companion these twenty years.\\"
B00013F35I|3.0|I am giving this three stars because it is, after all, a Bruce performance and stellar in that respect, as always. But I'm extremely disappointed with the almost bootleg quality audio and only passable video resolution.  Of course it didn't help that I viewed it immediately following the amazing NYC set (the most fantastically produced live music DVD I've  ever seen).  I can see why some might be mistaking this for a bootleg; it definitely feels like it in places.<br /><br />Since many reviewers seem to think the audio is fine, there can only be two explanations:<br /><br />1.  Those reviewers have low standards for audio quality, or<br /><br />2.  There are copies of varying quality out there.
B000002AP1|5.0|This album is all about, like its name suggests, RAW POWER! No album will get you as pumped; these songs are pure adrenaline. I know many people don't like the remaster, but I love it. The album sounds so loud and distorted that it is brutal! Especially noteworthy is the fiery guitar work of the criminally underrated James Williamson. Whether you take my stance on the remaster or disagree with it, get this album in some form if you don't already have it! Nothing has, nor ever will, match the intensity and violence of the sound captured here.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|About the Film:  I followed Advent Children closely from the first time it was announced some time in 2004.  I am a die-hard Final Fantasy fan, and although I would have preferred the sequel to one of the greatest games of all time (Final Fantasy VII) to be, well, a game, I was delighted to see the story continued in a medium with slightly more widespread appeal.  Although the writers made an effort to allow this movie to stand on its own, people who have played the game (and remember the plot and characters) will certainly get considerably more out of it.    About This Release:  In production since about 2006, this version of the film, subtitled \\"Complete\\" is the Japanese equivalent of a director's cut.  In addition to a new high-definition transfer of the film several scenes have been extended or reworked and new scenes have been added to further round out the story and provide more visual flash.  It may not seem like much while watching it, but in total the film has been extended by fully a third taking it from 90 minutes to 2 hours running time.    Visuals:  Although excellent, I have to say I was expecting more from the High-Definition release of this movie. My first misgiving is with the inconsistent visual quality. The newly added scenes are generally presented with the kind of sharp visual detail that HD enthsiasts have come to expect. The older scenes, while clearly providing more detail than the DVD release, are missing the clarity that true HD material is capable of, often appearing fuzzy or out of focus. It is not generally noticeable, but it does become an obvious annoyance in a couple of scenes. Arguably this could have been done on purpose, adding a \\"fuzzy\\" filter for ambiance, but I doubt they would have intentionally added upscaling artifacts which are present in this film. The most notable instance I can recall is during Tifa's scenes, particularly in the church; the aliasing on her hair is more reminiscent of a DVD being upscaled to 1080p than ofa new render done in 1080p.    Little touches have been added to further \\"sell\\" the quasi-realism that this film is striving to achieve. During battles characters' faces get dirty, during one scene flecks of dust in the air created little shimmers.    Story:  While the same story is being told, the added/extended scenes and to an extent the visual enhancements do add a different slant on the plot of Advent Children.  While the main points of the story remain unchanged, the plot is made clearer and certain elements which seemed random or unimportant take on new meaning.      [Spoiler alert!]    For example, during a scene a girl carrying a stuffed moogle comes up to Denzel and holds out her hand for him to follow. In the original DVD release, this is really all we see of her, but in the \\"Complete\\" release we get to see an earlier scene that reveals she is really trying to make an apology to Denzel for being rude before.     Denzel plays a much more prominent role in this version. It was never clear to me what it was that Cloud was so busy doing before I saw this release, but in this version it is revealed that he was out looking for a cure to the Geostigma so he could help Denzel.    In the DVD release, the Geostigma seemed like little more than a charcoal colored rash that slowly killed people.  In this version it is much more sinister, causing sores that ooze sticky black sludge and induces violent convulsions and vomiting of the same black sludge.    [End spoilers]    I'll leave the spoilers at that, but I've only revealed a couple of the dozen or so plot augmentations that this version of the film brings to the table.  Most of them gave me that \\"Ooooh that's what they meant. I get it now.\\" feeling.  Maybe I'm just slow, but a lot of these things weren't obvious to me in the film's original presentation.    Sound:  This film really benefits from the expanded HD audio - more so if you have the equipment to properly decode the newer HD audio formats, but even when down sampled to Dolby Digital, the sound is richer and has much fewer compression artifacts.  Some of the music has been remixed slightly and it seems like I heard one or two additional compositions. Many of the songs were written to lock in with certain scenes, and when the scenes were extended, so was the music. I was very impressed with how seamless it all seemed.    Voice acting is one of those things, like pizza toppings, that nobody seems to be able to agree on. I have never been terribly picky about voice acting, but since everyone is different I'll attempt to provide some frame of reference for my opinion.  My idea of poor voice acting is the Devil May Cry anime, and my idea of good voice acting is Cowboy Bebop. I think the voice acting is superb in Advent Children. I was particularly delighted to hear the voices chosen for the ancillary characters like Barret, Cait Sith, Red XIII, Yufie, Vincent and Cid. But the actors chosen for main characters Cloud, and Tifa were very good matches for what I imagined the characters from the game would sound.    Extras:  This review is of the Japanese release, and frankly I did not really care enough about the extras to check them out. I watched them once when the DVD release came out and can't be bothered to do it again. This does come with an additional animated \\"episode\\" about Denzel. For those of you who want to know absolutely everything there is to know about how a movie was made, you will not be disappointed with the depth.    For me the real attraction in the extras was the inclusion of the Final Fantasy XIII playable demo. Since the PS3 is region free, the Japanese release is very import friendly. (If you don't mind that it is all in Japanese) The U.S. release mentions a Final Fantasy XIII \\"preview\\". I don't know if that means that it will be a demo, or an extended trailer. It would be a shame if it was the latter.    Final Thoughts:  I wish all \\"director's cut\\" releases could enhance the original presentation aswell as Advent Children Complete does. The extra footage catapulted this already great movie firmly into the category of awesome. If you didn't enjoy the first release because you just didn't \\"get it\\" then this release may be just what you need to put the pieces together as many of the more vague areas of the plot are clarified.  If you loved the first one, then you'll love this one even more.  About the only thing it is missing is the ability to watch the original release version of the film. Personally that isn't an issue for me but it would have been a nice addition.      Although this review is for the Japanese release, I doubt much will change in the final U.S. version. My reasoning is that the the DVD release was nearly identical for the two territories, and there are only two months between Blu-ray releases.
B000PC8AFU|3.0|This set is essential if you want to have a (almost) complete collection of SRV. However, my gripes are in the mixing, most noteably \\"Texas Flood\\" and \\"Sky Is Crying.\\"<br /><br />In \\"Texas Flood\\" Bonnie Raitt's guitar overpowers the mix and should have been remixed completely. With \\"Sky Is Crying\\" it is extremely apparent that this version was cut from a much longer one and you can here it 3:07. Even if this song were 20 minutes long I would have preferred a full version over the inclusion of \\"Oreo Cookie Blues\\" or \\"Pipeline.\\"<br /><br />I dig this disc for the inclusion of a handful of Stevie's guest appearances (for more you'll have to Google his discography to see other artist's whose music he had guested on). But the mixes could have been better.

I went with this seat because it had more padding and also had the front piece so that my son could rest his head. The Ibert would have to attach to the handlebars so that the seat would turn with the handlebars. This was a dealbreaker for me. I didnt feel it was safe to have him turn with the handlebars, especially if we had to make a sudden turn, I wouldnt want hom to get whiplash.  The wee ride sits between the handle bars and seat, and is very stable. I'm 5'10\\" and was very comfortable with this seat on my bike.  I did have to ride slightly bowlegged, however it really wasnt that noticeable.  My son loved the ride, and we rode for 3 hours without any problems.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead is a band that never falls short when releasing an album.  They always deliver something new and fresh that's produced to the absolute perfection.  Ok Computer has a certain feel to it as does the other albums in their portfolio. The feel is slow and mellow and you will want to stay in its world<br /><br />Airbag- Not my particular favorite due to the electric guitar riffs, but a good song none the less.<br /><br />Paranoid Android-One of the best songs.  It feels very similar to \\"Knives Out\\" from Amnesiac, but its also a great original song.<br /><br />Subterranean Homesick Alien-Continuing the mellow element, the song is a trip.  Maybe something good to fall asleep to.<br /><br />Exit Music(For a Film)-I've listened to this song a million songs.  It is very sad but I love the hell out of it.  I wish I could see it as an exit song for a film.<br /><br />Let Down- About the same Caliber as \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\".  It's an ok song off of OK Computer.<br /><br />Karma Police- The single off of the album that I feel escapes the overall tone, but it's a song that most of the world can enjoy if they don't particularly delve too deep into Radiohead's head.<br /><br />Electioneering- It's a different style for Radiohead.  I like it, but we all probably won't be listening to this one a lot.<br /><br />Climbing Up the Walls-  All the last songs are winners.  They start off with this song that really succeeds in making me feel like I'm really climbing up a wall.  Perfect choice of title.<br /><br />No Suprises- Like I said, all the last ones rock, and \\"No Suprises\\" is a great example of how Radiohead can take us down under into sadness, and then bring us back up again with a hopefull song.  Not a lot of bands can do that and I've found a lot of respect for Radiohead through this change of pace.<br /><br />Lucky- My favorite song.  Makes me think of epic moments and incredible tragedies.  Best song on the album.<br /><br />The Tourist- Radiohead always has interesting exiting songs.  This one is very appropriate.  I like how jazzy it feels and how inventive it is.<br /><br />Go Radiohead! Nothing is holding you back.  After all it is albums like these that make us beg for more.  If you enjoyed this I reccomend Amnesiac and In Rainbows.w inventive it is.    Go Radiohead! Nothing is holding you back.  After all it is albums like these that make us beg for more.

B0019CSXAM|5.0|what can i say to add to everyone else's reviews - it is 100% worth owning. i bought this in october of last year and have gone through the dvds maybe 3 times so far. you can watch barney & company over and over again and not get tired of these episodes!    as for how this one rates against the other seasons, season2 is still my favorite, but owning all 3 is highly recommended!
1439136653|5.0|I bought this book because I too loved the movie, and wanted to read the inspiration.  I can see why the producers chose this book to adapt; it is an enthralling story about a young hero who has managed to value integrity, hope, and friendship through a horrible life.<br />Apart from the geographic setting, the age of the hero, and the tv show, the book's characters and events have little in common with the movie.  I leave it up to the future reader to discover the differences.  However I will not say the movie is better than the book, or vice versa.  They were both outstanding; they complement and enhance one another. I can now more fully appreciate the choices that the screenwriter made in bringing the text to the screen, to accommodate the 3-act mythological structure.<br /><br />I especially recommend the audiobook version narrated by Christopher Simpson.

386521584X|5.0|In 1955 - 1956, Robert Frank (b. 1924), an American photographer born in Switzerland, restlessly crossed the United States several times by car to photograph people and places as he found them. He gradually culled through thousands of photographs to select 83 images for his book, \\"The Americans\\" published initially in Paris in 1958 and in the United States in 1959 by Grove Press. In its initial publication, \\"The Americans\\" sold only 600 copies and received negative reviews.  Its stature has grown with time.  The book is now an American icon.<br /><br />The United States publication of \\"The Americans\\"  included an introduction by Frank's friend, Jack Kerouac, which had earlier been rejected by the French publisher.  Frank did well in asking Kerouac to write the introduction.  Years earlier, Kerouac had made a series of mad journeys across the United States resulting in his famous novel, \\"On the Road.\\" Kerouac's book shows more of a romantic spirit than the unsentimental photographs taken by his friend.  Kerouac's introduction captures the spirit of Frank's photographs and of Frank's portrayal of America and offers comments on several individual photos.  It deserves its place as part of Frank's masterwork.<br /><br />In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the book, the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. presented a major exhibition of Frank's work, titled \\"Looking In\\" which included the 83 photographs of \\"The Americans\\" presented in the order of Frank's book, together with other photographs that Frank took, including many photographs he took while he crossed America that did not make their way into the book. I was fortunate to visit the exhibition yesterday to see the photographs first hand.  The National Gallery of Art has also published an encyclopedic version of Frank's book, \\"Looking In\\" which is large and expensive and includes much material in addition to Frank's now iconic collection of 83 photographs.  My review here is of Frank's initial collection with Kerouac's introduction. The book is much less expensive than the reissue, is easier to handle, and provides the original version of Frank's masterpiece.<br /><br />Frank's pictures do indeed draw the view into the scenes he depicts. The photographs include men and women, whites and blacks, rich and poor. The photographs show a certain loneliness, isolation, and unhappiness, regardless of social class. Thus, there are photographs of a lovely  young woman operating an elevator, and of a hard-faced young woman behind a restaurant counter staring fixedly at the viewer. There is a photograph of a wealthy couple in Miami, of lavishly dressed gamblers at a Nevada casino, and of the elegant guests at a New York City cocktail party, drinks in hand, to benefit a school of art. Frank shows a segregated bus in New Orleans, and a scene of a stoic African American nurse holding a white baby in South Carolina. He photographs places, as well, a bar in Detroit, a collection of rubbish in the back yard of a Los Angeles home, that reminded me of works by Charles Bukowski, and the starkness of a men's bathroom and shoeshine stand - which Kerouac described as a place where the ladies don't go.<br /><br />The photographs suggest the fascination of American's with their cars - one of the best works in the collection is the picture of the dividing strip of an open road at moonlight. They also show the fascination of many American's with the products of Hollywood - with starlets, cowboys, and television - together with the inauthenticity and emptiness of these concerns. Politicians, such as the photograph of the \\"city fathers\\" of Hoboken, New Jersey early in the collection, and of wheeling-dealing. cigar-smoking delegates at the Democratic Party's Presidential convention in 1956 (all men) come across as arrogant, crude, and ignorant. Many of the photographs are draped with flags, or other symbols, and many include comments on American religion, from an African American preacher who traveled up and down the Mississippi River for years to bring people to God, to the crosses, churches, and calls to repentance that dot the American landscape, to orthodox American Jews at the banks of the East River on Yom Kippur casting their sins into the water.<br /><br />For all the melancholy, loneliness, and shallowness they convey, Frank's photographs show an understanding of the United States and a love of its people and places. His photographs of young people capture the alienation that has become commonplace since the 1950s, but also the search for love and meaning. His photographs capture the breadth of the United States, the difficulties of race relations, and the feelings of desolation, conformity, and tension, as people strive for financial security.<br /><br />I was fortunate to have the opportunity to see Frank's photographs themselves at the National Gallery.  This book of Frank's 83 photographs, together with Kerouac's words, offers the reader the opportunity to share, return to, and reflect upon Frank's photographic vision.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanippi River for years to bring people to God, to the crosses, churches, and calls to repentance that dot the American landscape, to orthodox American Jews at the banks of the East River on Yom Kippur casting their sins into the water.

B00004Z459|5.0|What can I say? Linkin Park has really not been so great lately. And I think that stems from a couple of bad decisions they've made:  1. Start cussing in their music  2. Start writing sell out pop (I'm not a whiney pop hater... but it's just not Linkin Park!)    That being said, this album is 100% genuine, satisfying Linkin Park material that has stood the test of time and is still SO good. From the tasty metal of \\"One Step Closer\\" to the heartbreaking melody of \\"In the End\\"  this album represents Linkin Park at their best. I also highly, highly recommend \\"Meteora\\" which is even a better than this one!     You can't go wrong with this gem.    OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS   Meteora-Linkin Park  Wonder What's Next-Chevelle  End of Silence- Red  Innocence and Instinct-Red  Define the Great Line- Underoath

0375826726|3.0|While I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books of the Inheritance Cycle, I found this book boring and uninteresting. I wasn't kept on the edge of my seat or was anticipating what would happen next. The events that took place seemed predictable. No surprises in the plot for me, especially with obvious hints that were placed in the previous two books and this one as well. Brisingr just seemed like a filler between Eldest and the upcoming fourth book in the series. I'll still read the last book when it comes out, but this just wasn't up to par for me, sorry to say.

I bought this book because I wanted to understand how my beliefs affect my body and my life in this world.  2.  The  story was told in a way that kept me wanting to read the next page, much like a good mystery story; in other words, Dr. Lipton kept the interest level high throughout his book.  3.  The book was very, very positive and encouraging.  4.  Alas, I was disappointed that the PSYCH-K change techniques talked about in the Addendum were not described in this book; perhaps in a future book???    Thank you Dr. Lipton!

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|THIS IS THE REAL AND HIDDEN SIDE OF AMERICA. What more additional evidence or explanations do people possibly need to get this fact that we have a major problem here? People are neglected and thrown on the street because their insurance premiums aren't high enough or just cannot afford to pay health insurance. I am worried that it will take hundreds of millions of people bankrupt and out on the street just because they cannot afford health insurance (not mortgage, car loans, educational loans, credit card debt) to demand REAL CHANGE.<br /><br />Some main things you have to keep in mind<br /><br />(1) The Universal Health Care is NOT FREE as Moore keeps advocating.<br />(2) There are also many people who are discontent with European-style universal health care.<br /><br />Reforming medical industries is not possible unless we reform our monetary policy, fiscal policy, foreign policy, and civil liberty policy. They all go hand-in-hand. We have cut our wasteful spending on military budgets, foreign aids, drug wars, welfare, social security, education, subsidies, tax breaks, lobbying, etc.<br /><br />There are many alternatives to what we have right now and what they have in Europe. One alternative is to have a single-payer medical insurance system as everyone knows. The other is to give people tax credit to cover their medical insurance. The third option is a hybrid of the two.<br /><br />People are deluded in that they believe America is a free country. They are waking up slowly, but it will take more than anything we have ever experienced to turn this nation around.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|The SR is one of my favorite movies. The tale that this movie weaves about justice, injustice, redemption and just deserts was done marvelously. Everytime me and my husband come across it while channel surfing we usually watch until the end again and again. Morgan Freeman's voice draws you in and captivates you. And this was Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is the best prison drama ever made.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|This movie is only scary if you've seen it before knowing the game. Other than that, it's pure [...]. The BTS (behind the scene) is the writer, director and creator talking about how close they believed the movie is to the game. But if it was close at all they would take the time to make several movies to go along with the several games AND include all the monsters. There are about 4 monsters in the movie that are from the game. There was actually one that i believe wasn't in any of the games. To trick you out of thinking that they're lazy, they made up names instead of just doing what i said before: MAKING MULTIPLE MOVIES WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN EACH INSTEAD OF SCREWING STUFF UP IN ONE MOVIE.  Some parts of the movie bored the hell outta me. I had to skip the part with the husband because it was absolutely boring to see him just walk around looking for a way to get to silent hill. If he had gotten to Silent Hill at a good time we might have something exciting going on but of course he doesn't live up to that.  But the movie is not a total loss. Despite being ONE mess of a movie time was actually *somewhat* put into it. Most movie monsters aren't real things; people just pretend that monsters are there and scream over nothing. But in the movie, all the monsters are ACTUAL people in costumes (discluding some of the hanging figures) That makes it much more believable and easier to act with instead of acting with something that is not even there.  Speaking of acting, it was better than in the game. The characters aren't clueless against some things (I.e in the first game, somebody goes into an elementary school, finds a wheelchair and goes \\"A wheel chair? in an elementary school?\\") and actually make it more believable because they act how anybody would act if they were in a hellbound place (they scream, are scared, etc.) but in the game they just keep being bewildred but not quite scared.

It comprises of thirteen track lists including Fixing a hole, She's Leaving home, getting better, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and a lot more.

0143038419|2.0|I know that Elizabeth Gilbert struggled with the title of this book and will start by saying that \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is not the right fit either. Readers, this book is not about learning how to live a quality life through simple means. I don't mean to be callous, but for irony's sake I'll just let it out. This book might better have be titled \\"I, I, I\\" - It would have been perfect for her Italy, India and Indonesia travel combination but also the fact that the account can be blindly self-involved. Although interesting when it comes to the details of Balinese culture toward the end of the book for example, I thought the overall story had no real depth or insight.     I personally don't think that marriage is a must but I do know that it if you decide that it's for you, it should be sacred and serious. Both partners must commit to maintaining the relationship during the hard times. Gilbert, who says she is so kind as not to expose her ex-husband's faults in the book, appears to almost walk away from their union with few attempts to salvage it. It may be that some unforgivable incidents took place between them but because we are not told the story and can only judge her character from the narrative that follows, one can't help but see that she has underlying issues when it comes to men. I expected to learn about stronger ideas, about unconditional love or quiet personal prayers, but instead learned more about how certain women fill the void in their life through an infatuation with the opposite sex. It seems that wherever Gilbert goes, the talk of men pervades. Even under the disguise of friendship at an ashram we see that men are her crutch. We all know this type of person; a slightly neurotic species, needy and scared to be alone; the kind that craves attention, fairytale love, drama and lust while fearing a calm, quiet and stable love.     I read this book because it was recommended to me by so many people simultaneously. I think it reminded my friends of my solitarytravels and desire to write. I'm flattered but have to admit that this book was not satisfying to read. It took me so long to finish, I can't tell you. Where Gilbert was in life then, though she obviously acknowledges that other facets could be fulfilling, she chose men as her salvation. I did not enjoy this sense of destitution at all and worry about the message it perpetuates in today's world. There was so much more that she could have experienced and shared on that journey, so many more colorful travel details that might have captivated the reader.    The book however, does have its good qualities. The author has good writing skills and I can see this book entertaining those who desire to see the world; young women who are in a similar state of exploration, self discovery and soul-searching. It's nice to hear about the different places she visits. Girls, if you haven't had a chance to travel, this can be a really fun book for you. Focus on the places and not the mindset if you can.     I thought that the development of her meditation skills in India was especially commendable and I admire her discipline and perseverance in that type of setting as well as in other places with which she was unfamiliar. That's a nice quality to have - adaptability and flexibility.
B000093BDX|5.0|I am a music lover, I love spending some of my free time listening to classic music, like the music of 50's, 60's and 70's. One of my favorite compilations of classical songs is sung by the \\"Beach Boys\\" one of my all time favorite band.<br />When the \\"Sounds of summer\\" was out in the Market, I immediately purchase some copies for my own and for my friend who has been an avid fan of The Beach Boys.  And well, I am really happy as the majority of the featured music in the album is so great. It was really what I expected! And some of the great hits they featured in the album are God Only Knows, Wouldn't It Be Nice, Don't Worry Baby, and a lot more. If you still haven't heard the songs, go, buy and listen to it now! I might sound very demanding but honestly, it's worth your time... Honest!<br />I hope everyone will purchase the Beach boys album, as they are really great! Really worth your money!

B00000I41J|5.0|I have been listening to recordings of jazz from this era for 30 years, with particular focus on people like Coltrane, Miles Davis, Bill Evans, and others.  I don't know how this gem got past me.  I just discovered it about 3 months ago and it's a beauty.  Cannonball Adderly is a fine player, of course, but this recording is also indispensable for Miles Davis fans.  As others have pointed out, if one just listens to the record without knowing, you'd think it was a Miles Davis record, so prominent is his role and how impeccable his playing.
B001GQSY5K|4.0|I've been a Star Wars geek since the third grade, and I am now the proud mom of two elementary-aged boys who (like most of their friends, I'm glad to say) also adore the series. Frankly, I sort of wish Lucas had stopped with the three original films which I think are classic and wonderful. The three newer live-action films left a lot to be desired, I felt, but my boys adore them all just as much if not more than the old Luke/Leia/Han movies I grew up with. With the boys it's all about the action, and The Clone Wars delivers. We saw the preview to this film in the movie theater, and our whole family of four almost jumped out of our seats. How cool! A neat looking cartoon version of the mythical clone wars starring my favorite character, the awesome Obi Wan. Of course, we went out  to see it on its opening day (along with some other families with Star Wars boys) and the kids adored everything about it. My view was that it was neat-o, for sure, but clearly not made for adults. Let's be real, this movie is positioned as the set-up to a new cartoon television series, so it basically seems like a slightly long episode of a tv cartoon. But I like the look of the series with its vivid interplanetary settings and way-cool battle sequences. And being able to see Jedi in action is an overdue pleasure. However, questions are raised which are impossible to answer. I, for one, can not relate to the character of Anakin as a mentor to a youngling since I know that one day he's going to cold-bloodedly murder a whole temple full of them. My kids even asked me if Anakin is going to kill his padawan one day. Yikes! But if you've got kids in the house or a Star Wars collection to add to, you simply have to buy this.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|I enjoyed this CD, especially with an orchestra for support. The arrangements for each track were well put together.  I don't believe this CD is as good as The Girl in the Other Room, but nonetheless a buy for Diana Krall fans.  I'm not sure when others comment about being bedtime music are truly expecting, most jazz is relaxing. If I am working out I listen to Korn and Disturbed but to eat and drink at a candlelight dinner this will fit the bill.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I just flat out love this movie. I'm a middle-aged mom who isn't the biggest action fan in the world, but this movie bowled me over. My young sons weren't sure they wanted to see it at the theater (my younger boy spooks easily and thought Iron Man looked scary on the commercials), so I ended up watching it on a plane last summer. As soon as I saw it, I knew I'd buy the dvd. My husband and both boys love it now, and I think it's my favorite action movie, and certainly my favorite superhero movie (because I don't like any other superhero movies). The film moves along at a breakneck speed, almost as quickly as Robert Downey Jr. talks. This is a fast, clever movie that is by turns seriously moving and laugh-out-loud hilarious. The casting is sublime. Any other actor would have given the movie a completely different tone. I totally bought Downey as the smart-alec (I'm using the nice word) savant with a weakness for women and cars but a sincere desire to do the right thing. I just love this movie! Can you tell?

All of the great songs are here (Living in America, Eye of the Tiger, Burning Heart, Hearts on Fire, the Rocky Theme, etc.) I love it and it just makes me love the old movies even more.

B000A3VTT8|4.0|For most newcomers, viewing opera is a unique experience. It is unlike watching plays yet the staging is similar. When viewed on DVD, one expects to be entertained as if watching a standard film.<br /><br />I truly enjoy opera at home when a piece is given a theatrical film feel. Opera must be seen on stage for it to be truly appreciated for what it is and what it is meant to be.<br /><br />Rossini's most famous opera is The Barber of Seville. If you have experienced 'Barber' then please watch this beautiful piece. It is based on Perrault's 'Cinderella' but without the witches and magic. The magic here is the music, the fun story, the bungling cast of characters and the playful situation.<br /><br />Don Ramiro is a prince briefly disguised as a groom while his groom portrays him. As the groom, Ramiro visits Don Magnifico and his two daughters. He first encounters Cenerentola, Magnifico's step-daughter. They immediately fall in love but the prince has to know for sure if her heart is pure with goodness. The two daughters, Tisbe and Clorinda fall over the livery-disguised prince, suffocating him for a chance to be the lucky bride. Don Ramiro looks on. The philosopher Alidoro sets things up a notch by giving Cenerentola a chance to visit the prince's mansion.<br /><br />Claodio abbado conducts the Orchestra del Teatro Alla Scala. This production is based on the 1973 production which Jean-Pierre Ponelle originally directed. The setting, the staging, everything feels like a dream, from the comical costumes of the two sisters to the battered home of Don Magnfico to the palatial mansion of Don Ramiro. A DVD worth getting if you want to sink your teeth into the best of Bel Canto Italian Opera. Also highly recommended: L'Elisir d'Amore (Donizetti - Netrebko/Villazon with Alfred Eschwe conducting).<br /><br />For those new to opera, also, check out A Night at the Opera by Sir Denis Forman. This book is the most essential reference book. I've had my copy for nearly ten years. Unquestionably the greatest approach to enjoying and following opera.h to enjoying and following opera.
B001W63DX2|5.0|I'll be seeing the film when it premieres worldwide tomorrow night, but as soon as I saw it available for pre-order it was a no brainer that I had to order it. I saw three shows from the \\"Somewhere Back in Time\\" world tour so I know the movie and bonus concert disc will be awesome. Iron Maiden rules!
B001PPLIFU|3.0|This a decent movie but not up to the Casino Royale. It was anticlimactic and the bad guys are not scary enough. I rate it 3.5 out of 5 stars.
B00260HH3K|5.0|I have watched dragon ball since i was a kid and i must admit like in every movie based on a book or anime it left out more then a few things. But on the other hand they did a great job putting the movie togather it was fun to watch it would recamend it to anyone ... even my freind who i dragged along .. who didn't even want to see the movie cause she said it would be bad turn out to find that she enjoyed the movie.
006135323X|5.0|I'd really give it 4.5 Stars, but definitely recommend it, so that's why I marked it as 5 Stars.  If the author provided more practical information, I would have given this book the full 5 stars.    The author really delves into how we behave irrationally, even though we believe that we're rational.  I really like the chapter about the cost of ownership and how we value items more highly when we own them.  This reflects the state of how people over-value real estate when they own it or why people find it easy to buy a stock that's rising, but difficult to sell a stock when it's falling.  That's the practical parallel that I drew from it, anyway.    It also helps readers to understand risk more and really increased my risk-taking (ironically, but admitting how irrational I can sometimes behave and think).      Best part: I enjoyed the fun examples and could relate personally to these. These cases can easily apply to professional and personal contexts.

0316010669|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's book takes research from existing fields and combines them with compelling case studies, accessible prose and entertaining style. He persuasively demonstrates that we can make intelligent and founded \\"snap judgments\\" in the blink of an eye. It really helps to break down what many of us entertain as instinct and intuition.    It's great for professionals who want to advance their careers. This book discusses how we judge others in professional contexts, but that these seemingly \\"gut feelings\\" we have can lead to making effective decisions that will sometimes prove more beneficial than excess analysis or simulation modeling.    The book gives broad examples of these \\"intelligent\\" blink-of-an-eye judgments, from how people can prevent fraud and save millions, win in simulations, judge others in professional contexts, as well as win over strategic analyses by using experience.    It's one of my favorite books of all time and I refer to it when training professionals on First Impressions and it's inspired me to do more research, training and writing on the field. He's a trail blazer because he takes makes this area of interest fun and readable to the general public.
B001PL4HZW|5.0|I thought this CD had a great assortment of music that worked well for the movie.
B00005JPSM|3.0|Zeta-Jones plays a somewhat mentally disturbed chef here who is saddled with raising her late sister's child, but doesn't know how. The movie can't decide if it's a comedy or a melodrama, so every time it flags you get a large dose of cute from the child in question. There's a love story here somewhere, too, naturally, but it lacks much heat. This was a summer movie and that's what it remains. Just okay.
B00127RAJY|5.0|After finding out about this video from the Wedding Bee I decided to look into it because all the brides were highly recommending. I was blown away when I got on Amazon and there were so many reviews and all mostly really positive. I was still a little skeptical but ordered the video anyway.   I did my first workout this morning and it was TOUGH! I have been exercising 5-6 days per week for eight weeks doing basically the same things in my workouts- cardio, strength, abs and rotating all of that. I have to admit this one on Level 1 was tough. I plan to do it through the week and move up to Level 2 next week...we'll see. I still plan to do my regular afternoon workout with my trainer and do this video at home in the mornings.   I am only 4 weeks away from my wedding so I hope Jillian can help whip me into a little better shape! I will try and keep you posted!
1569242739|5.0|I am a relatively new vegan and haven't done much baking. I was really skeptical about how the first batch of vegan cupcakes would turn out -- I was cooking for my (non-vegan) sister's birthday party, and was so doubtful that I sent my husband to the store to buy some traditional cupcakes as backups.    Not only did the vegan cupcakes turn out fabulous, they were so good that my sister opted for the vegan ones over the traditional chocolate ones! They are simple, delicious, and quick to make. I'll be working my way through this book!
B000R9RGF6|5.0|A wonderful, creative and unusual piece of music.  Ludovico Einaudi is probably the premier composer of contemporary classical music today.  I look forward to hearing more of his truly original and beautiful music.
0877180121|4.0|I just started my 6 year old (first time teaching for me) in this book. I think it's easy to teach from for someone who has never taught piano lessons before. I couldn't decide between this and another John Thompson book (Teaching little fingers to play), so I ordered both. This one is definitely slower moving for younger kids (\\"easiest\\"). I chose to use this one. (My adult brother is using the other book to learn.) :)
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is one of the best Disney movies ever.  My grandson watches it every week when he visits, and sometimes over and over.  He's gotten now to where he knows many of the words!  I bought it for his 4th birthday to keep at our house, and it's provided many, many hours of enjoyment for all of us.
B000VDDWDS|4.0|The Movie: This is not a plot driven movie. A ship is hunting a bigger stronger ship.  The end.  This is however a character driven movie.  You get to know the sailors, their friendships, quirks, etc.  The young kids on board the ship was something different than most high seas films and made the movie better for it, was interesting to see. The ship fights are great and really exciting. Cool movie if the high seas on film are your thing.    The Blu-Ray: Picture quality is nothing to brag about but it is solid and many steps above the DVD. Dark scenes show grain. Other than that is does a decent job. Should have been a gorgeous movie on blu-ray though. A good 7/10 for PQ. The sound however is awesome!!! 10/10 easy.  The surrounds are active and kicking throughout the entire movie.  All the creaks of wood, gusts of wind, drops of rain, surround your room and pull you onto the ship.  Just watch the first 15 minutes of the film and you'll hear how great this soundtrack is. Love it. Ship battles are insane and make your speakers do what they were built for.

B000GH3CVQ|5.0|The title says it all.  This is a refreshing change from the hyped-junk that is currently being shoved out in front of the public by the music companies.  Escape the junk, and enjoy this great music.  Also check out the movie called \\"Once\\", for which this music is the soundtrack, and these musicians are the actors.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|With \\"Crack the Skye\\", Mastodon firmly cements their place as the best of today's metal.  Both lyrical and masterfully played, this cd takes you on a musical journey few groups attempt and even fewer succeed in doing.  Best metal cd of the decade?  Well that's for time to tell but I would be hard pressed to name many better.  Great metal lives...long live the Kings.
1582701709|4.0|This book is a must for everyone. Great starter book to gain basic understanding of The Secret. I personally finished the book feeling like, \\"what now\\".

0061689246|2.0|Stardust is a story that could have been great. It has everything going for it: a magical kingdom, a long lost princess (and prince), a quest for true love, wicked witches, and a genuinely likable hero. All the makings of a wonderful fairy tale - only more exciting because it's new. We've never heard this particular tale before. But sadly, this book falls short.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. It's a good book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the first three quarters of the book. The characters are realistic (or as realistic as they come in fairy tales), and the story is intriguing. But there are some downsides - serious ones - that prevented this book from truly shining.<br /><br />First of all, I was under the impression that this is a children's book. Imagine my astonishment when in the very first chapter there is a sexual scene described much more graphically than I would want any child of mine to read. That immediately lowered the bar for me. If you're going to write a novel on the level for children - even if older people can read it - don't limit your audience for something that could just as easily be skipped over.<br /><br />Next, this book had no climax. The most dramatic, tense moment in this book was when the hero, Tristran Thorn, confronts his childhood sweetheart Victoria. Neither of them wants to marry the other, but they both feel obligated to do so. Which comes out all nicely in a brief speech by Victoria.<br /><br />After the middle of the book, Tristran never faces or realizes any danger whatsoever. He merely goes home, discovers he's outgrown it, leaves his family and all his friends without a thought, and goes on to travel some more. The star, Yvaine, likewise faces no danger after the middle of the book. Even at the end, when the witch who wishes to eat her heart confronts Yvaine, Yvaine calmly tells the witch that she has given her heart to Tristran, and so it is no longer hers, and so bids the witch farewell. And the witch leaves!!<br /><br />And finally, the very end. This story is hailed as a fairy tale. Fairy tales NEVER detail the death of the hero. The story ends while everyone is happily ever after. But in this novel, Tristran dies, and Yvaine rules for many years afterward, spending much of her time gazing yearningly at the sky. The ending is at best bittersweet; the hero dead and gone, the heroine lonely and homesick. Hardly the proper ending for a fairy tale.<br /><br />Needless to say, I will more than likely never read this book again. And due to the explicit scenes in it, I will never read it to my children, either. So the real question is: why did I spend $8 for this book?iled as a fairy tale.

B00103584Y|3.0|It is a story that unfolds three different ways, which is OK, but the heroine must run to make sure she is there at the right or wrong time so that the movie has an end, usually like someone dying.  I don't think Hollywood or Bollywood would ever propose such a weak scenario, but you know how our European cousins think, they must have thought it was great. A commercial interruption during the movie would not have been too much!!!!
0545128285|5.0|I purchased this book for my three granddaughters to read.  They are Harry Potter fans so I thought they would enjoy Ms. Rowlings latest book.<br />They loved the book.  I have also read the book and find it interesting<br />and well written.  This was no surprise considering the quality of writing<br />in the Harry Potter books.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. has done some good movies these past few years; including some pretty esoteric stuff (Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang - Wonder Boys - Tropic Thunder) but he sometimes borders on the outrageous here as Tony Stark - In a good way.  His experimentation in the lab with his robots by his side, was particularly funny. He delivers a somewhat cool, calm yet lackadaisical approach to things when the pressure is on. He did everything right in this movie and I think that's why he's endeared millions more fans because of it.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges was extremely annoying and obnoxious as Obadiah \\"Stane\\" (was that a subtle hint?) and the \\"Iron Monger\\" who battles Iron Man in the final sequence. Which by the way, reminded me of RoboCop 2 (RoboCop vs Cain) and Edward Norton's \\"Hulk\\" vs. Tim Roth's \\"Abomination\\" battles.

B0019EXZY4|4.0|The run-up to the heist was kind of slow, but then again I can see how they wanted to setup the whole caper for us to understand. Very tense, exciting and full of twists in the plot. The scumbags, radicals, small-time hoods, crooked and straight cops, MI5 or MI6 and Royals all come together; well, not all at the same time. I really enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />Sex, politics, burglary, robbery, murder, deception, torture - it's all here.
B000MTFFZY|5.0|I think some of the best rock/metal today comes from Europe, and Delain's 'Lucidity' is a prime example. Awesome guitar perfomances teamed with fantastic vocals make this one of the best symphonic metal albums ever!!! They pulled out all the stops with artists from some of the most successful bands (Marco Hietala from Nightwish, Sharon Den Adel from Within Temptation and Liv Kristine from Leaves Eyes to name a few.) I hope this is a project they plan on repeating!
B000Y179KO|4.0|Long Road Out Of Eden is far from being the Eagles' best album but it is a strong effort nonetheless. Self-produced by the band, this is a double album of beautiful harmonies and great songwriting as they manage to create a niche where to sound convincing and not too commercial. Songs like the title track are bold and courageous with its 10-minute-plus message of hard times a-coming, with lines like 'But all the knowledge in the world is of no use to fools, and it's a long road out of Eden'.   So what we get is about 90 minutes of beautifully recorded new music ranging from rock & pop to folk & traditional.   This is not to be compared to the Eagles we all know from the seventies, it feels more like a worthy new beginning for a band that still has something to say.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|I admit I had no idea what this movie was about other than it involves the Holocaust and has a scene with Kate Winslet in a bathtub.  The first half of the film is adequate as a teen-boy-has-affair-with-older-woman story reminiscent of \\"The Graduate\\" and \\"The Door in the Floor.\\"  However, in its second half, the film suddenly turns into a provocative tale of morality.  Kate Winslet earns her Oscar in a conflicted performance: You sympathize with her when she becomes the scapegoat of a trial, and you hate her for her frustrating lack of remorse.  The film doesn't ask you to forgive her, but to put yourself in her shoes.  Yes, there is obviously something psychologically wrong with her that helped her do the horrendous things that she did, but in spite of that, can you say with confidence that you wouldn't have done the same?    Bottom line: Some may find the film gratuitous in its eroticism, immoral in its portrayal of the Nazis, or boring in its pace.  Not knowing what to expect, I found it sexy, challenging, and absorbing.    Richard Yee, author of [[ASIN:1441462163 Deliveries: A Collection]]

Somewhere in my strengths it says for me to find a communicator. I found out my manager is my communicator, now how cool is that!     I highly recommend this book to everyone.... especially business owners, buy ir for all your peeps. You will be amazed.
B001DHXT20|4.0|I'm one of the few people who liked Ang Lee's \\"Hulk.\\"  I thought it was a great blend of character and action, up there with \\"X2.\\"  Yeah, it had some slow spots and the CGI was inconsistent, but the Shakespearean storyline and the artistic visual style set it apart from other superhero films.  The new \\"Incredible Hulk\\" is more by-the-numbers in terms of style and character depth, but it's definitely better in terms of action and effects.  The first one tried to be serious; this one just tries to be fun.  In my view, both have succeeded in what they set out to do.    Bottom line: If you were disappointed by Lee's version, you'll probably like this one.  I happened to like Lee's version and found this one more entertaining, if not as unique or intelligent.

030014332X|2.0|The concept sounded great, but I really can't recommend this book. It's very euro-centric, too simple and light for adults, and unless you read it aloud to your kids, so they can ask questions and get explainations that are missing, not readable for a young adult. It was clearly written in another time and age and it shows. And stopping as it does at 1945 or so, it's missing a little history to say the least.    Updated 12-2010    So I saw that so many people found this book to be 5 stars, and only 5 of 9 people felt this review was helpful, I reread the book. I am just as convinced then ever - it is out of date, missing entire cultures(and not minor ones), not interesting enough for a child and too simple for an adult. Perhaps I've read too much history to find the value in this book. I would even say that even one of the Dummy books would be a better read then this.
B001FB55MG|5.0|Four of us laughed very hard at this movie, mother, father, 13 and 18 year old males. This is a really good, funny movie, that I think most families would enjoy. It doesn't run the more normal Disney route, in fact if you didn't know it was Disney, you'd never put it in the same league as the cartoons or the marvelous company that brought us Beverly Hills Chiuahua or College Road Trip.<br /><br />Adam Sandler is just exactly the right kind of funny in this film. He used to have the Jim Carrey disease, too much over the top stupidity that was just Adam Sandler playing Adam Sandler. He's grown up a bit, he can still crack a good slapstick joke. He didn't go so far away like in Punch Drunk Love to the serious side. He's really got a heart of gold in this film. I'm not the biggest Sandler fan, but in this film he works well.<br /><br />Keri Russel is simply gorgeous as Sandler's ultimate love interest. August Rush ([[ASIN:B00133KFGW August Rush]]) another fantastic family film, but this time about fitting in. Lucy Lawless (Xena) is so perfectly wound up tight at the hotel front desk. Courtney Cox, oh poor Courtney, I just wish she would get some kind of strong good role. She is Sandlers sister in this movie, and is the set up line to many of his jokes. She just seems to deserve better, or I want her to be better in the movies. Guy Pearce is so awful as the hotel nemesis, he looks like an ugly version of Brad Pitt. And Richard Griffiths (Dersley in the Harry Potter series) is perfectly fat, stupid, and mostly evil in this film - not much of a stretch from the Potter films. The supporting cast is very good - Rob Schneider shows up and is restrained.<br /><br />Oh just such a good fun film. The clips make it seem almost like a Ground Hog day, where Sandler is trapped in the bedtime stories. It doesn't really play like that. The stories are there as a plot element, but it's more about heart and doing the right things than those stories. In fact that is the point of this film, be good, work hard, and good things will happen to you.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, this is standard high quality Hollywood film making. Big budget, well shot, well edited, well recorded...no nits to pick anywhere really. It's what we expect from a good current film. Even the CG effects are sufficiently well done even on a television screen. Yes the Roman Colessium looks fake and CG, but it's also a dream sequence, so it's not a horrible thing.<br /><br />The film is rated PG. It seems like younger viewers will get this film. I laughed when Skeeter finally kisses Jill, the children's mother Wendy puts her hands over their eyes so they don't watch. It's so perfectly that age, I remember it so well with my boys (don't watch the smoochy moment in the film). There are a few slightly off color jokes, but they are really mild. No violence. Nothing even remotely approaching nudity (Skeeter does hold up a pair of underwear at one point to show that he brought his toothbrush, toothpaste and clean underwear....well not so clean). It seems most children would get this humor and love the funny story.<br /><br />The DVD had no special features at all. A barren disc except for the movie. Well it does have that stupid Disney \\"fastplay\\". Whoopie, press the menu button to avoid that nonsense.

B000TNF7OC|5.0|This is THE best UFO to me because it was the first I heard from them. Rock Bottom, Too Young To Know, Queen of the Deep, and Doctor Doctor are just awesome tracks. I noticed alot of people rank FORCE IT as their best, I say listen to the Lead in Rock Bottom again, you might changed your mind. Also, NO HEAVY PETTING has my 3rd all time favorite track \\"On with the Action\\", so FORCE IT comes in 3rd after NO HEAVY PETTING.<br />PHENOMENON, is by far the best to me because of the feeling it gives me. Phil's voice is so good on this, and Way's Bass cuts perfect around Schenker's Guitar. Great songs from a great era. I still listen to the CD all the time. I highly recomend this to lovers of Classic music. Right up there with ZEPPELIN and AEROSMITH.<br /><br />If you like this album, try NO HEAVY PETTING, FORCE IT, OBSESSION and LIGHTS OUT too!<br />The only regret I have is I missed seeing them play back in the day because I couldn't afford the ticket. Though all my friends claimed they were one of the best the ever saw live.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|The Blue-ray version is beautiful to behold.  You'll spend half the movie marveling over the sights and sounds of this presentation.  Then settle in to the simple tale of the wooden boy's quest to be human.    Disney is one of the few studios that knows what to do with the blue-ray format.  Much care is taken at every step.  You'll want to set aside an hour or two to explore the extras.    Highly recommended for blue-ray owners.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|Shelter is a defining film for the gay community and stands shoulder to shoulder with Brokeback Mountain. For all the criticism about its imperfections on plot line and lack of sexual content, the movie depicts an ordinary situation for a young disenfranchised man with raw talents and suppressed aspirations. Movie critics were looking for gay stereotypes in such films, and the lack of it should be celebrated as a hallmark that the time of acceptance has come to mainstream markets.    Trevor Wright delivers a masterful performance as a rebellious, dissatisfied artist with a confused sexuality. He embodies the angst of someone having to put off his dreams and goals for the betterment of others. The camaraderie between him and Brad Rowe is easy and believable. The scenes of intimacy speaks to a couple who has found a connection beyond sexuality and physical needs. Through a simple smile, a look of trust, and a gentle caress, Trevor has conveyed what gay relationships (or any romantic relationships) are really about - connecting with that one individual that makes you feel like the top of the world every day.    By portraying intimacy rather than lust, this movie has successfully recast sexuality as an aspect rather than the entire identity of a person. That assertion in itself makes this a brave film by refusing to bend to perceived gay norms. It is no wonder that this movie had consistent connected with people old and young, gay and straight, rich and poor - the truth is powerful. Look no further than the hundreds of positive Youtube reviews for confirmation.    I hope that Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe will get more work - they have truly done gay and lesbians a service by doing this film and should be rewarded somehow.
0880793589|4.0|I have been using this creative whack pack since 2006. These have been used in my facilitation session with mid and senior managers / executives. The various cards open new perspective and insights into issues that are usually blindspots for many. I strongly recommend this deck of creative cards for your HR / Training interventions. I have gotten the \\"A Whack on the side of the Head\\" book also. This book and cards goes hand in hand.   Have said these, you must experience it for yourself. However, i think readers will benefit only if they are clear with their intentions.     Cheers!
1416550542|5.0|This one grabbed me at the first page, and did not turn loose.  Other reviewers have done grand jobs of summarizing.  For a novel that covers such an expanse of time and space, the author does a superb job of keeping the reader on track.  Actually, it is like reading a series four novels, and a book of fairy tales, but interspersed.  All the threads are interesting, and any one, standing alone, would be a gripping read.  I consider myself a mature, highly-educated reader. A younger, less-educated reader also read my copy, and recommends it.  We passed it to her 30-year-old daughter, and she loved it, too.  The appeal is broad, and we are looking forward to reading Ms. Morton's other book.
034544678X|5.0|Just a warning this is a pretty lengthy review, but you can just skip down to the\\"Why I Like this book\\" section to get a good idea.    After finishing this book I felt obligated to write a review as I have simply fallen in love with Patricia McConnell, her life experiences, thirst for knowledge, and of course her own dogs.     Before I began this post, I wanted to see what the people who had given the book a 1-star had to say and it made me want to write this all the more.  In one review, the person stated they got the book to, \\"Gain any insight on remedies to help me along with my dog I rescued who has trauma and is an alpha female dog and can't walk on a leash or socialize with other dogs/people.\\"  Their problem with the book was \\"This book didn't even go into any training techniques, Patricia Connell just was so into her own dogs, that I felt like I was reading a expose' on her dog's lives.\\"  I think that this is a great example of ignorance and an excellent example as to why it was such a brilliant book.  First of all, on the first page right after the title page under \\"Notes From The Author,\\" McConnell writes, \\"There's actually very little that's intuitive about handling and training a dog, especially one with a serious behavior problem, and there's no substitute for getting a helpful coach who can help you one-on-one.\\"  This just goes to show that even though McConnell is an expert on this subject(which I feel anyone who writes a book should feel about themselves) that she knows that you cannot solve you or your dogs problems just by reading a book.  She gives exactly what the person said they wanted from the book which was INSIGHT to understanding not MEDTHODS to fixing your dog.  As for the comment about her dogs, the relationship she has with them is what I feel is a major motivator for her to be so involved in this field and why her book is so popular(I will go into more detail about her dogs later).    A little about the author.  Patricia McConnell is anApplied Animal Behaviorist, which she states numerous times throughout the book(another complaint from a 1-star reviewer) with a list of credentials worth mentioning.  She did her research for her Ph.D on the relationship between what sounds humans make and the reaction they have on animals.  Although I do not know if she is still is as involved in it, McConnell saw cases of dogs with aggression and behavioral issues at her business Dog's Best Friend Training. She tours across the country giving speeches and seminars on human/dog relationships.  However a lot of her great insight comes from her experiences on her farm with her many generations of Border Collies and Great Pyrenees Dogs that which are vital parts for raising her sheep.  She has competed in sheep herding competitions and I do believe bred or at least studded Border Collies.      With that said let me get to why I loved this book.  Patricia McConnel has a wealth of knowledge whether it be from her studies, experiences working with behavioral cases, or from her experiences with her own dogs and uses them all to give great insight to her readers with a goal of helping them to begin to understand what their dog(s) are doing and why she feels they do it. She begins each chapter with an anecdote then goes on to add her information on the topic and supports every bit of it with some sort of research(a quick glance in the back of the book and you will become dumbstruck at the amount of references she uses to support her ideas and thought processes using anything from research on wolves to horses to primates).  While some research was over my head, her anecdotes and personal insight are what kept me reading.  Her thirst for knowledge and love for her dogs radiates throughout her book and I as well found myself helplessly in love with them enough to the point that it saddened me greatly when I learned that 3 of them had passed.  She covers topics like sounds, sense of smell, body language, dominance, playing, how to choose a dog, personalities, and grieving.  Her book was not a how-to on tricks or behavior modification, rather it was to help the average dog owner to better understand their dog(s) in order form a desired relationship with them.  If you are looking for immediate solutions or answers to your dog's existing problems this will not give you what you want.  However, for great insight between the animals on both ends of the leash look no further than Patricia McConnell.    On a side note, I purchased this book along with another highly recommended a positively reviewed book from another author but refused to start the other book until I purchased and read McConnell's other book \\"For The Love Of A Dog.\\"  Happy to report that although I just began it, I feel like I will be writing a similar review for it as well.
031606792X|2.0|Ok first a few spoilers within. I enjoyed most of the books in this series until this one.  The biggest problem I have is the lack of character development.  Here Bela had the chance for a lot of character development having to chose the life of a vampire over all of her family.  Instead she just gets it all for free.  Myer fell in love with the character and refused to advance the story.  Plain and simple.  This could have been a great series instead it faded out and I will have forgotten about it in a few months.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|This is a study in sadism. Unmitigated psychological abuse meets up with wild heroism in the character of a complex, but silly convict, Luke Jackson (Paul Newman). Wrong is called right, justice perverted, but he turns the tables and starts to goad the \\"bosses\\" into ever more serious conflicts until they kill him.
B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|I began watching Season (Series) 4 and felt no particular joy in it. The episodes were ok, I wasn't crazy about the companion this time (she struck me as mostly annoying)and I began to wonder if I'd wasted my money. \\"The Doctor's Daughter\\" episode seemed to bring more promise of good things to come and when I got to Disc 4 (which is about halfway through the season) I hit the episode \\"Silence in the Library\\" and was immediately caught up in the mystery that continued in the next episode. From then on, the series really seemed to catch fire for me and by the end, I was convinced that Donna was actually a really great companion and the writers had really brought in a huge success.    However, it also kind of brought on the \\"what will they do to top that\\" that sometimes presages the beginning of the end for a show. I hope they can keep it going with more thrills (a new companion always gets interest up) and more of the thoughtful and touching elements these new writers have produced over these 4 years. It was a great pleasure to watch season 4, especially the 2nd half.

0060837551|5.0|This novel is absolutely wonderful. I'm ashamed to say this, but I've only recently read it. A relative had an old copy of this novel, and I decided to give it a try. I must say that I was very hesitant at reading this novel because I remember a few parts of the movie from my childhood, and it didn't interest me in the least. I must admit the movie is decent, but I do prefer the novel.    This is a story of three generations of a family. At the heart of the story are Meggie and Father Ralph. It is because of these two characters that the book is primarily based upon. I will try not to spoil the story, but Meggie and Father Ralph love one another. Will he end up leaving the church he loved dearly? Is Father Ralph willing to turn away Meggie to become the perfect priest?    There are numerous other characters that one will find in this novel, and I must say that I would have loved to learn more about Meggie's brothers---especially her eldest brother Frank. Every character in this novel is well written and will make you want to know more about many--if not all--of the characters.    There is heartbreak, tragedy, and misery in this novel. But this novel also includes love---family love, romantic love, and love of one's roots and land. It's a beautiful story and I highly recommend it.
B0001WTWCO|4.0|The Bottom Line:    A weighty, somewhat self-important adaptation of an acclaimed novel, The English Patient (along with other movies that fit that description, like Sophie's Choice and Cold Mountain) was pure Oscar bait but it's also a suitably epic romance that will no doubt appeal to those who like this sort of thing.
B001HZ9ABM|4.0|This album features some of the last of the majestic, ethereal vocals of Robin Gibb. In 1969 he was still surrounded by the great orchestration and actual band of the Bee Gees first fame. This isn't for everyone, but wow. When he filed the berg into the shape of a ship and his girl moved to Finland, I laughed, I cried, I was made a better man. They don't make it like that any more. How to follow this, I will give you a hint. \\"It's a square dance Mr. Marshall\\".  Barry Gibb gives us the strangly threatening \\"You'll never see my face again\\" but seems to be headed in a country direction. It is also worthwhile That Maurice Gibb contributed the catchy \\"Suddenly\\". Where this album falls down perhaps is the overabundace of that generic early seventies acoustic guitar strumming. I guess \\"the times they were a changin.\\"
B0013FDM7E|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Everything with Will Smith fighting loneliness by himself in New York City is worth watching and everything with Will Smith fighting poorly-CGIed zom-pires is worth fastforwarding--throw in some heavy-handed religiosity and you've got a mixed bag of a film that should be approached with caution.
0446604844|3.0|Determined to followup his claim to fame with a novel of equal epic proportions, this is what we got. Total Control is FOR THE MOST PART a well executed political thriller with a few twists and turns and action. It's also a double edged sword in many cases, in that for every good thing Baldacci does, he also errors slightly. For example, the overall story is very intricate and well developed, but this makes the story overly long, and the area between page 400 and 600 sometimes seems like a drag. The story has a great ending, with lots of action and battle, but then the biggest climax of all is just sort of thrown out the window and dismissed in a single sentence for one of the greatest letdowns ever.  Similarly, the plot is very clever and well thought out, but it's also hard to follow for the casual reader. There's a lot of info to digest while reading, and it can make it a tough read. Lastly, I know some people pointed out the fact that many of the characters are unrealistic, and this is true in some cases. I'd say that Baldacci makes about half of his characters believable in this one, which... is not horrible, except the main character, Sydney Archer, is not one of them. The result is that this book can only be read in little pieces at a time, it's not the page turner that it's predecessor and the next book are.  Overall, not a bad followup to a breakout work. It's nowhere to start, definitely do Absolute Power first, and then maybe The Winner and then this. Baldacci is sort of hit or miss, except for this one, because this one is smack in the middle.
630529142X|5.0|This is one of Adam Sandler's best comedies. It had me in hysterics until the end credits. Kathy Bates sometimes steals the show as the mama who thinks that girls, football, and Benjamin Franklin are the DEVIL. Fairuza Balk plays her part well as the young woman who falls in love with Sandler. Henry Winkler may be past his prime, but he is still capable at giving a great performance like this one in particular. A typical cameo by Rob Schneider adds a nice touch to this movie. If you can sit through a comedy without looking for social or political commentary, then this is for you.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|Alert!: Huge Korn fan.    This is a great album, obviously. I don't have time to go through every song individually, but I'll let you know it's a great CD. Every song has a certain meaning behind it. Without Head, the band is still amazing. When I first got the album, I was weary on it and I was thinking to myself, \\"Gosh.. Korn sounds completely different.. Idk if I like this album that much\\" but the life came back into me, and after replaying the album I was instantly in love with it.    You have to be crazy to not have this album a part of your collection!

0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is one of the most powerful books on philosophy that has really affected my outlooks of values in life. What makes this novel even more remarkable is that the story is heartfelt and true in which the author, Mitch Albom, collected the memories and made into such an extraordinary book. Mitch, at the time a student at Brandeis University, came to favor a particular sociology teacher because of his unique and in-depth teaching styles. Morrie Schwartz, the professor, taught Mitch more than just sociology. He taught him how to live his life to the fullest. Over the years following graduation, Mitch becomes almost obsessed with the materialistic objects society pushes us to want. Absorbed in his work as a sports writer, he forgets the importance of having relationships in his life and focuses more on his career. That is until he sees Morrie on television one night, and discovers that his college professor has been diagnosed with ALS.  This disease affects the nerve system, and eventually leads to death. After seeing the program on TV, Mitch decides to visit Morrie every Tuesday, just like he had back in college for their weekly visits. Each visit reveals the thoughts and emotions that everyone goes through, and really teaches Mitch to better himself and break the boundary that society keeps us so tight in. This book covers more than just one theme. Although it includes the important themes in life such as community, marriage, material possession, and death, the author puts main focus on the importance of learning how to live well. Morrie states \\"Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live\\" (pg 82). What he means by this is that when you are close to death, no materialistic objects are going to matter. What does matter is the relationships you've made and the love you gave and received. The author gives a clear view of this in the beautiful way he writes the story. The story is written in first person, showing you the emotions and thoughts constantly running through Mitch's head. His undeniable originality in his work also adds affect to the emotions you feel throughout the story. Never have I read a book that has made me feel sad, yet some sort of happiness like this story has. It has made me re-evaluate my morals in my life, putting family first and then others. I also came to realize after this book that in the end, money doesn't matter as much as society trains your brain to think it does. This book achieved its goal of understanding human values by sharing this story between a professor and a colleague and the journey one takes toward the end. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who is seeking fulfillment in their life. This book is full of love and wisdom and is sure to touch anyone's heart at one point or another.

B001K3JF7K|2.0|I am a big Diana Krall fan and thought it impossible for her to do a bad album.  Then I bought and played \\"Quiet Nights.\\"  It is not an altogether bad CD, but it is the least interesting one that Krall has ever recorded.  By her standards, it is a failure.  By something approximating absolute standards it is mediocre.  There is one brilliant, shining moment on this CD and that is her take on the Bee Gees' \\"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart.\\"  That cut possesses everything that makes Krall great.  It is too bad that the rest of the CD fails to deliver.  It is a surprisingly tepid affair.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|First I watched the unrated edition and there was nothing on it that seemed out of place and all in all it seemed like a clean enough movie that i would not have a problem with younger moviegoers watching it.<br /><br />Second, I did not get the memo that Jason Straham is the the new Bruce Willis!  This guy is in every movie I have seen lately.  Which is no problem because he does a great job.  He is sort of the stealth action film star.<br /><br />Now for the movie.  I expected nothing from it and just hoped that my time would not be wasted.  Instead I got a film that had an intense and exciting opening and kept the pace all the way until the end.  There was enough action to occupy me that I was actually wanting the movie to keep going.<br /><br />The plot was about average for a movie this packed with action, but essentially the main character was framed for a crime he did not commit just so he could be a feature driver in the Death Race a made for pay tv show.  Of course he has revenge on his mind and that plays out well enough during the movie.<br /><br />I really liked Death Race and have no problem giving it two thumbs up.
B000002G8L|5.0|I am a big Eric Clapton Fan. So, this may be a bit bias, to some degree.  But, I believe this is one of, if not the best Clapton live albums out there.  Depending on your taste, you may prefer blues playing Clapton, or pop music Clapton.  I fall into somewhere in the middle.  Where I really enjoy the guitar virtuosity of Clapton playing the blues.  But, I also like his more pop friendly songs that do also happen to have great guitar playing as well.  On this album in particular, Clapton melds the two, and adds some root laiden country, and folk music as well as his pop, and blues standards.  The result is a very listen-able album that changes up the music enough that you don't want to skip song to song.  Highlights for me is \\"Tulsa Time,\\" \\"Lay Down Sally,\\" \\"After Midnight,\\" \\"Setting Me Up,\\" \\"Blues Power,\\" and an awesome version of \\"Cocaine.\\"  I think if you look at this album as not a Clapton effort, but as just music to enjoy, you may finding yourself enjoying music you really didn't think you liked much.  I found this out with the more country-esqed songs.  This is a very enjoyable album that would be a great road trip CD's to take with you.  And, in my opinion, Clapton's overall best live album to date.
B00008R9KF|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in close to 20 years, but remembered it fondly from when it first came out.  As I rewatched it, it brought those days back.  A beautiful film, about love between to very different guys.  I can watch it over and over.

B001FB4VZS|5.0|WOW! There is such a fresh new energy this year! I can't believe its the same show! The writing for these characters has become so mature! Clark FINALLY mans up & Lois Lane totally ROCKS! Tom Welling & Erica Durance are utterly fantastic as Clark Kent & Lois Lane! Their chemistry is undeniable! And the new villains Tess Mercer & Doomsday are awesome! Mercy is the Lex Luthor protege & she delivers an amazing subtle sinister ore that makes you know that something wicked is coming!     Clark Kent has become such a man this year! I came so close to giving up on this show because of his constant whining & PINING over Lang! It's been refreshing to not have to sit through that up until the amazing and phenominal Bride episode. But no matter how fantastic the Bride episode is, it's disppointing that Lang's brief guest appearance brought that back & that the writers have allowed Clark to regress to his emasculated ways when around her.  The arc that they created for Lang is by far the most ridculous in the shows history, yes, even more so than the witch storyline.    The only other bummer this season is what they have done to Supergirl. They poorly wrote her character then wrote her off the show. Supergirl is part of the Superman mythology & she deserves much better! I hope they bring her back as a regular & repair what they have done!     One thing I'd really like to say is that DC Comics & Warner Brothers need to get over it & allow Wonder Woman & even Bruce Wayne to pop in since all these other background heroes have.     Those things aside, this 8th season has massively ROCKED! I once again look forward to every new episode & more than that, I look forward to every scene with Clark & Lois together! Lois Lane is his future & destiny & the ultimate love of his life! I can't wait to see the legendary love affair begin! These writers have the opportunity to make them EPIC! I hope they do it! I truly hope that the show keeps going and going! But even more than that, I'd loveto see the \\"powers that be\\" bring Tom Welling & Erica Durance to the big screen as Superman & Lois Lane in the Superman franchise reboot!!! That would ROCK! :-)

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|i am normally averse to purchasing live recordings for reasons well known(sound quality,it somehow just never quite sounds like the original cd,drawn out versions of songs,etc).in respect of certain artists and for completist reasons,i from time to time deviate from this self imposed practise.leonard cohen is one such artist,and how glad i am that my policy does not apply to him.like a vintage wine,older,wiser,after having lived the life(from being involved with rebecca de mornay to spending time with monks)due to financial reasons,he during 2008 had to undertake a series of live shows,being back on boogie street.this double cd is of the concert he held in london. the sound quality is perfect.the atmosphere an appreciative audience and the artist one who is complety at peace and on song.i have always maintained that an album does not necessarily have to in respect of each song contain a five star song,for it to be a five star album.i believe that one song may be so striking,that it by itself may lift an otherwise fair album to four or five star quality(dylan's brownsville girl is a case in point).  in this instance,the song is \\"if it be your will\\" a stunning song when it appeared on the original album ,but given an interpretation on this album that makes it timeless.having said that,the gems do not end there.\\"my sceret life\\",\\"hey that's no way to say goodbye\\"  (to name but two )also standout.and then there is \\"hallelujah\\".sure, the buckley version is great,but here,it is as if this interpretation could only be given by the man himself  and only after all these years.  and,his interaction with the audience is also warm and intimate.  definitely one of the albums of the year.
0316168815|3.0|The title of The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is an indication in itself that the novel is anything but ordinary.  After all, how could bones be lovely?  Occurring throughout the novel is a series of ideas and thoughts that break through the mold of what people are used to thinking.  A tragedy in a small town brings everyone together to question the causes and cope with the effects.  It isn't a depressing novel to read, but makes you thoughtful instead of agonized.   The book is written in first person point of view, through the eyes of a fourteen  year old girl looking down from heaven.  She struggles between watching the lives of people on earth, and finding the right place for herself in heaven.  In a quote from the novel the main character, Susie, says \\"When my father's car pulled into the drive, I was beginning to wonder if this had been what I'd been waiting for, for my family to come home, not to me anymore but to one another with me gone.\\" I believe the author wanted to convey a message, that it is important to move on and live life, but not to forget the ones who have died and how they have influenced your life.  I found that as I read this book, I thought about both of my grandfathers, and even though I had never met them before they died, I am still reminded of them through certain things.       I would recommend The Lovely Bones to someone who would like a simply read with a complex message, and who wouldn't  be seriously disturbed by some bizarre scenarios.  Although there weren't a lot of intense action scenes, it was hard to put the book down.  It was inspiring, encouraging you to live life to the fullest, and not to worry about the small things.

B0010X8NF0|5.0|The Darjeeling Limited packs a punch! There's lots of action, drama, comedy and suspense in this film--it grabbed my attention and it never let go until the very end. The cinematography and the choreography were brilliantly done; and the acting was very convincing. The plot moves along at a good pace although I suppose they could have cut a couple of minutes here or there; but that is a minor issue.<br /><br />When the action starts, three estranged brothers who haven't even spoken for a year get together in India for what one of them, Francis L. Whitman (Owen Wilson), says is a spiritual journey so that they can connect again. Francis and his two brothers Peter L. Whitman (Adrian Brody) and Jack L. Whitman (Jason Schwartzman) all have unresolved issues. Nevertheless, they all meet just as Francis tells them to and they begin their journey across India on a train called The Darjeeling Limited.<br /><br />The character quirks make them so human, too. Francis is the control freak who even hires an assistant, Brendan (Wallace Wolodarsky) to make laminated daily \\"itineraries\\" so that every moment is structured. Peter is having a baby with his wife Alice from whom he simply \\"expects\\" to divorce someday; and Jack is estranged from his former girlfriend. Jack can't get her off his mind; we see that in the introduction to the movie when Jack and his ex (Natalie Portman) are alone together and later on in the actual film when he keeps checking her answering machine to monitor her incoming messages.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, the brothers pick up a snake and when the snake gets loose the train conductor isn't exactly happy about having a snake onboard the train. The brothers alienate themselves even further from the train conductor when one of them accidentally breaks a glass window--the brothers go from being confined to their cabins to getting kicked off the train!

0316067598|3.0|forget the politics. I thought the enemy was the Taliban, not the \\"liberal media\\". The story of heroism and sacrifice is enough to warrant your attention. The rants on politics make you wish Luttrell was exposed to more information.
B001NFNFNU|3.0|I was surprised by the subdued manner in which Ms. Jolie played the lead character in this somewhat disturbing film about a stolen child, and a replacement masquerading as the original. Mr. Malkovich too was subdued in his supporting role as the crusading minister who comes to Ms. Jolie's aid when she has difficulty with the authorities. And although I felt somewhat uneasy with how the lead characters interacted (Mr. Malkovich's acting style has that effect on me), interest in the story kept my attention, as did the excellent support provided by Amy Ryan who befriends Ms. Jolie while at the hospital. Not his best, but another Eastwood winner.
B000H5U832|5.0|probably the best animated movie I have seen. my son would watch it twice a day if I let him.
B001N26GFM|3.0|Of all the Holocaust dramatizations I've ever seen, this one was easily the most contrived. Though I really wanted to like it, I quickly realized it wasn't going to be able to live up to the expectations I had for it.    Not knowing a great deal about the plot beforehand, the idea of a movie about the Holocaust approached from the perspective of a young German boy seemed a really intriguing idea. But in translating that idea to film, something was lost.    Though it might seem an inconsequential and trivial point to some, as an English film with English actors, for me, a good deal of credibility was lost up front. And there were other problems here. The notion of a camp inmate being able to slip away unnoticed, presumably about the same time each day, to talk, play, and share food with his young German companion - who would ultimately be able to dig under the electric fence that divided them, also unnoticed, seemed particularly far-fetched. What's more, the wife of the Nazi commander who is responsible for operations at Auschwitz has no clue that Jews were being sent there to die, or that her husband is there to make sure this happens according to plan. At times she even seems sympathetic to the plight of the Jews, thanking the prisoner who worked in her house for bandaging her son's knee, wincing when he is beaten, and looking on with an obvious sense of disapproval in finding her daughter's bedroom plastered with Nazi images, even questioning what the new tutor was teaching her children. The notion of an unsuspecting, compassionate woman as the wife of a high-ranking Nazi official was perhaps the hardest idea of all to swallow. Was the intention here to soften a much harsher reality because that reality - that she knew exactly what was going on and agreed fully with her husband that Jews could not be considered people - was too much to ask viewers to digest?    Other things were \\"off\\" here as well. The way in which the two boys communicate with each other, particularly in the beginning, seems more befitting men many years older than a couple of eight year olds. And young Bruno's perception of the concentration camp as a farm, its inmates as pajama-clad strangers, and the prisoner in his house as a man who willingly \\"gave it all up\\" (meaning his career as a doctor) to peel potatoes - which should have been able to come off as genuine enough as an eight year old's observation - somehow didn't.    The young boys were really quite good actors, so kudos to them. I can't say the same for the actresses who portrayed the mother and sister - their performances were a bit on the bland side. And David Thewliss, an actor I've admired for some time, was simply miscast here.    All this aside, the last twenty minutes build in intensity to deliver a final unexpected wallop - powerful enough to almost overlook the problems unraveled in the first hour.     Though it could have been a lot better, the film makes a point about the utter senselessness of man's inhumanity to man, and if it makes young people interested in learning more about the Holocaust, then in the final analysis, it was an important film.
B000000W6R|5.0|I ordered the CD form of this because was not on Smashing Pumpkins' vast Amazon MP3 catalog. I just got it today and I love it! If you're a collector of SP's material, this is a MUST, as it contains songs from the Siamese sessions that didn't make the final cut that weren't on any singles or anything, so this is pretty much the only way of accessing them. They are up to par with the album too! By the way, this album is also great for the casual fan because this is your usual early Pumpkins, very impressive. Anyway, the previously unavailable songs, in order, are \\"Frail and Bedazzled\\", \\"Whir\\" and \\"Spaced\\". Another song on here that's exclusive to this collection is \\"La Dolly Vita\\" on CD. \\"La Dolly Vita\\" was originally on the \\"Tristessa\\" single which was only available on vinyl, and it is available as a good CD-quality track here. So, after you reading this short review you can probably tell that it wasn't exactly for those who are totally new and unfamiliar to the Smashing Pumpkins, but more familiar fans and collectors. However, this CD is a must for those who are trying to collect all of their stuff, those who loved \\"Siamese Dream\\" (didn't we all???) and anyone who loves 90's alternative in general (check out \\"Frail and Bedazzled\\")! ATTENTION: There is a bonus single that came with the vinyl edition of Pisces that featured two old demos. They are available right here on Amazon MP3 under the album \\"Rarities and B-sides\\"; they are tracks 26 & 27. So, after you order this CD, snag those two MP3s so you'll have the [more interesting] expanded edition of Pisces!
B001L5SXQG|2.0|Every artist is entitled to a bomb once in a while and this is Bruce's. Sorry dudes but both my husband and I share the opinion that maybe Bruce should have waited and worked a bit more on this CD. These songs are loaded w/easy(and bad)rhymes, cliched imagery and uncreative non-melodic music. ??! This is esp noticeable because his previous CD (Magic) is so damn GOOD. We kept waiting for the song that would redeem this effort and it never showed up. I can listen to Magic over and over but could barely get through WOAD twice. Pretty bad and from Bruce? Pretty shocking.

0316017922|4.0|Perhaps some of the most intense criticisms of Gladwell's work come about because his ideas are not always supported with rigorous scientific methodology. His books are good \\"airplane books\\", i.e., books you can read on the plane and during layovers. You can usually finish them in a day.  Really this is all he is trying to do; he is satisfying the curious reader with thought provoking journalism. Though his style might be considered persuasive, it is up to the reader to apply this knowledge to his or her life and determine whether it is relevant or true.    \\"Outliers\\" does this quite well. One idea that Gladwell reinforces is that focused time and effort is likely the only difference between some of the most influential humans and some of the least influential. At a young age Bill Gates had access to a computer terminal through his school and he took full advantage of that access. Because of this unique opportunity, Bill Gates may have had more hours logged in front of a computer than any other person in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Gladwell goes on to explain the rule of 10,000 hours. If you spend 10,000 hours doing something, you are likely to have a significant degree of expertise in that subject. An academic course of study, or the time it might take to obtain a senior position in a job might be 5 years or so, which is about 10,000 hours assuming 40 hours per week of work. it is an interesting idea and one to think about the next time you ask yourself \\"is this really worth my time?\\".    One study that Gladwell mentions follows the family tree of immigrants in the US during the Industrial Revolution.  In some of those cases, he showed how an immigrant who worked in a textile factory would spawn children who eventually became owners of tailoring or seamstress businesses. However, their children then became doctors and lawyers, many of which were extremely successful. He illustrates how timing, a particular gap in activity, and other conditions led to the greatsuccess of some of these lawyers and how their family history made it all possible. In three generations, these families saw a total transformation of lifestyle. One thing he did not address (and I still haven't answered for myself) is why the 3rd generation was not also entrepreneurial in their vocation? I suppose to be a successful lawyer one must have an entrepreneurial spirit, but I am curious to see what vocations the 4th and 5th generations choose.    I'd suggest \\"Outliers\\" to anyone who has asked what makes a person of history a person of history. If nothing else, it will give you something to think about on the 12:55 from Newark to Houston.
0618918248|3.0|The God Delusion is an interesting book that raises a lot of questions around organized religion.  Dawkins's cynicism took something away from his arguments, and he also spends a lot of time knocking down arguments he makes up himself (the classic straw man).  Dawkins does a good job pointing out the absurd nature of many religious rituals and postulates, some so ingrained in our lives we may not notice how silly they are.  As much as he tries to include all modern religion, it is clear he has a particular bone to pick with Christianity.<br /><br />Early in the book, Dawkins barely touches on more intellectual religious thinkers like Paul Tillich, then brushes them off under the guise of focusing more on pedestrian views of religion.  As an intellectual, why not argue against other intellectuals?  His focus on debunking mainstream, fairly simple religious anecdotes while completely ignoring more intellectual arguments is a major flaw in this book, and made it seem like he was picking off the low hanging fruit at the expense of  arguments where he might not be able to brow beat as successfully.<br /><br />Dawkins can be funny, and this book is a quick read, so I can recommend reading it, I just don't think there is enough substance to change many minds.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|I'm not referring to the movie, which was entertaining, but to the unusual fact that no inserts with pictures and information was enclosed, and the cover went apart when opening it.  It was sealed in such an idiotic way, that the plasic was torn apart to remove it, thus leaving the movie cover dangling loosely. I thought I was smart ordering the movie from USA, because it was out there before in Europe, but before receiving the movie it had been released in Europe, at a cheaper price and with a much greater choice of subtitles.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Certainly this is one of the two most intriguing versions of this movie I have seen.<br /><br />If Jane Austen herself were alive today, I suspect whe would love this version.<br /><br />In the Laurence Olivier version, I thought his Darcy came across as somewhat affected and foppish.  I have not seen the Colin Firth version yet, however I did see his depiction of Darcy in the modern Bridget Jones Diary movies, and he did seem off in his attitude towards Renee Zelwegger's character.  He seemed too snooty, and as if he genuinely disliked her at times for no reason.<br /><br />My other favorite version is the Bollywood version, Bride and Prejudice, a must see totally enjoyable version with the beautiful Aishwarya Rai, and replete with Bollywood conventions including musical numbers.<br /><br />The Keira Knightley version I have seen several times, and even made copious notes about it, because whether you know it or not, many love stories follow the template of this story, and it has become an enduring classic for good reason.<br /><br />The dialogue is simply beautiful, the scenes excellently executed, the lead actor Matthew MacFadyen interplays brilliantly with Keira, offering excellently nuanced scenes.  Finally, a lead actor who truly does justice to the role.<br /><br />Like many love stories it starts out on the wrong foot, when Darcy disses her to a friend.  He does not know she has overheard.  She responds with some later banter putting him in his place, and like the flick of a switch he becomes intrigued with her. Yet as you get deeper into the story, misunderstandings arise, new perceptions, a whole welter of emotions.<br /><br />I especially loved the scene where he proposes the first time and totally screws it up. She is hurt and angry, and turns on him, and yet beneath that anger stirs a passion.  Beautifully done.<br /><br />Mr. Darcy: ...Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances?<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennet: And those are the words of a gentleman. From the first moment I met you, your arrogance and conceit, your selfish disdain for the feelings of others made me realize that you were the last man in the world I could ever be prevailed upon to marry.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|Doubt is written and directed by John Patrick Shanley, who also wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning play. The film was one of the most acclaimed films of 2008 and scored Oscar nominations for all four main performances...I can honestly say that Doubt is, without a doubt, one of the best films of 2008.    Meryl Streep plays Sister Aloysius, the dictator-like principal of Saint Nicholas Church School. Lips eternally pursed, Aloysius inspires fear in the hearts of staff and students alike. Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is the parish priest who is universally loved by all; nuns, students, superiors...Everyone except Aloysius. When Father Flynn takes an interest in a young African-American boy named Donald Miller, Aloysius warns Sister James (Amy Adams), the young and innocent history teacher, to keep her eyes open. One day, Donald Miller is called to the rectory by Father Flynn...When he returns, Sister James notices alcohol on his breath; she reports her findings to Aloysius.    Doubt is not a mystery or a \\"did he or didn't he?\\" about the priest. If this is all you want from the film, you'll be disappointed. Doubt is about exactly what it title implies.    Much has been made about the performances in the film...I'm about to add to this. Hoffman, Streep, and Adams all deliver powerhouse performances, but for completely different reasons. We have three actors here all delivering various degrees of performances. Streep completely disappears into her role, simultaneous getting our fear, hatred, and sympathy. Hoffman plays his role so well and with such nuance, we don't know how to feel about him. He's fascinating. Amy Adams brings such an innocent, endearing quality to her role it becomes apparent why she's one of the most acclaimed actress's of recent years...And than there's Viola Davis, who has less than 20-minutes of screen time and was nominated for an Academy Award.    Davis is the most talked about, despite having only two scenes. In the first, she's working with Meryl Streep and actually threatens to upstage the woman. Davis plays Mrs. Miller and brings such a dramatic punch to the film; it's a travesty that an actress who pulled off such a feat did not win the Academy Award. She is the heart-and-soul of this film.     Even the child actor's are good and don't have that annoying \\"clearly acting\\" quality.    Anyone studying terrific acting need look no further than the scene where Father Flynn is confronted by Sister James and Sister Aloysius. I found this scene more thrilling than many action movies and the way the actors play off each other while the tension slowly builds is just wonderful.    Movies based on stage plays are usually so rooted in their stage origins, there's little room in a film version for anything besides great acting and a great story. Well, Doubt has both as well as great set direction and great cinematography by the legendary Roger Deakins.    Entertaining, timeless, and powerful. Doubt may not look like a very appealing movie to the masses, but it's a wonderful film with some of the best performances of 2008. Not to be missed.    GRADE: A

0930289234|5.0|After seeing the movie, I knew I had to read the book. The movie left me wanting more, as there were, in my opinion, too many questions left unanswered. Plus, when was the last time a movie did justice to a book?<br /><br />Watchmen, by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, is a great novel. Sure, it is a \\"graphic novel,\\" but the story, artwork, and story-within-a-story are fabulous. For those unaware, Watchmen concerns a group of super heroes, the \\"Crimebusters.\\" Of the members, only one, Dr. Manhattan, could be considered a typical super hero - he was in an accident that made him into a superhuman. In addition to being blue, he has the ability to teleport himself and others, to see the future, and more. The story begins with the death of one of the Crimebusters, The Comedian. It then moves along as an investigation of the murder by one of the remaining members of the group, Rorschach, who discovers a plot to kill or discredit the remaining Crimebusters. Interspersed within the novel is the story of The Black Freighter, another graphic novel, that adds an interesting perspective on the main story. Moore and Gibbons also provide several other additions that add to the novel; excerpts from a \\"kiss and tell\\" book, psychiatric profile of Rorschach, an interview with Adrian Veidt, and more.<br /><br />This is one of the best novels I have read. The artwork and the story, alone, make this worthy of your time. But beyond that, Moore and Gibbons have created an amazingly realistic world with full, rich characters that are not perfect, even though they are costumed heroes. The narrative moves quickly to an excellent and satisfactory climax. This is a novel that requires no previous knowledge of the characters, but one that fills in the backstory on each in a unique and intelligent manner. In short, this is a novel that you will reread on a regular basis. It is that good. The only drawback to Watchmen, and it is a strange one, is that others will continually deride you for reading a \\"comic book.\\" If only they were open minded enough to realize that this is a great work of fiction; intelligent, complex, and brilliant.\\"comic book.\\" If only they were open minded enough to realize that this is a great work of fiction; intelligent, complex, and brilliant.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This is an outstanding film, brought to us by a legend of the industry.  This movie has it all: solid acting, great characters, cinematography, pace, and plot.  This film will make you think, and this film will make you feel.<br /><br />Eastwood is simply great in the tailor-made role of Walt Kowalski.  Like any great actor, he shows you all the dimensions of his character.  At first, you think he's just a cranky old man.  Then, his bigotry is front and center.  Little by little, you begin to understand him and why he is the way he is. Before you know it, you are identifying with, and sympathizing with, a guy who needs love more than contempt.  Of course, he does find his redemption, through the most unilkely of people.<br /><br />That Clint Eastwood is great in this film should come as no surprise.  The real surprise comes via two completely inexperienced actors, Ahney Her as Sue, and Bee Vang as Thao.  These two most unwelcome next door neighbors help Walt find his redemption, and give him the love and respect he gets from no one else.  Sharing the screen with Eastwood is no small task for any actor, no matter how experienced they might be. These two rose to the occasion.<br /><br />The details is this film are just perfect.  The casting is excellent, from top to bottom.  Eastwood's son, daughter-in-law, and grandaughter are played to perfection by Brian Haley, Geraldine Hughes, and Dreama Walker.  They are self-absorbed and clueless as to the needs of Walt.  Walker is the teenager you love to hate, especially when she is lusting after Walt's prize Gran Torino in anticipation of his ultimate death.  Haley and Hughes' good scene was when they showed up to Walt's house with what they thought were perfect birthday gifts.  The gifts of a \\"grabber\\" and a phone with huge numbers to this man who was still so vital was tasteless.  The scene played out perfectly.<br /><br />The extras and smaller parts were fantastic as well.  I especially enjoyed watching the thugs and gangbangers.  They looked great and were very believable.  The locations in gritty Detroit were just right.  Whatever time Eastwood and Team spent scouting locations really paid off.<br /><br />Finally, to release this most un-PC of films in hypersensitive Hollywood was ballsy on Eastwood's part.  You will hear more racial slurs than you thought existed.  These slurs are not gratuitous; rather, they define the Walt character and make his actions all the more important.<br /><br />Don't miss this one.  Highly recommended.d were very believable.

The book was read to me many times by my dear Mother who passed away March 1st 2009.<br /><br />The book is wonderfully illustrated and has very few words, but I think that is what is so special about this imaginative story. It leaves so much room for your imagination and it never grows old. I can remember my Mother using different voices for each character in the book when she would read it to me and when I got a bit older I read the book over and over again.<br /><br />Nothing will fill the emptiness in my heart, soul and body caused by my Mother's passing, but looking back on these cherished memories makes it easier and bearable. I was lucky to share many years with her and I never took her for granted.<br /><br />I love and miss you Mom!<br /><br />I wasn't aware that this book was even in print until reading an Amazon friend's review for it.

B001PPGAIA|2.0|The good: It has a fair score and the cinematography is excellent. There are a lot of spectacular scenes of Australia. The story is touching and good-natured. However I did not like this movie at all. Why? The Bad: It was long - too long. I thought two or three times that the movie would finally be over and I would be out of my misery, but it kept going. The movie is overly predictable. While I did not know the end at the beginning, I always knew what was coming next. The entire thing was filled with cliches and cheesy scenes. There was a lot of overplayed drama, and I thought that it was overly romantic/unrealistic. The narration from the boy was cute at first, but I felt like I knew when and what he was going to say, and was left waiting for him to finally conclude so that movie would end. Finally, I felt that the aboriginal sense of nature, while interesting at first, was overplayed - like much of the movie.  Overall, I thought that the movie was beautiful, but would have actually preferred to watch a nature film like Planet Earth instead of this. It was too long, the story was cheesy, and it was way way too predictable.
1595141715|3.0|For younger readers, for whom this book is really aimed at, I think this story will impress upon the reader that actions have consequences...and those consequences aren't always the ones you think that they will be.  This is a well written story, that in the first half at least builds good tension and makes you want to keep reading.    However, I have to say I also think the author misses the real emotional despair, loss of hope and the loss of other options that make life living that so often lead to suicide.  On those fronts this book seemed to be truly lacking and in the end it seemed only the actions of her \\"friends\\" and their carelessnes lead to her death and it simply doesn't ring true.  I can only hope that this book reaches someone at the end of their rope and keeps them going past the dark points in their life, but for the age group it is aimed at I think this book will still be a good read.

B001UGIIMA|4.0|Those that enjoy a nice spy thriller should find this one compelling. The story isn't new, but Robert Redford and Brad Pitt are a good team, and there are enough twists to keep your interest. Redford intially mentors Pitt at the CIA, but then follows his career as a spy. When Pitt is caught in a trap, Redford tries to help him escape. Good effects and production values make it worth at least a rental, but the acting and story may implore you to buy it. I didn't find the picture and sound so dramatically different to warrant buying this in Blu-ray. I think most people interested in this movie will be satisfied enough with the standard version.

I've also seen the movie and miniseries. I was delighted that it was finally released as an unabridged audiobook and even more pleasantly surprised to find Scott Brick among the readers. For anyone unfamiliar with Brick; he's one of the better readers I've heard and I thoroughly recommend his version of the unabridged \\"In Cold Blood\\".<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />Unlike many audiobooks, this version of Dune has many \\"readers\\". I'm not quite sure why, but I thought \\"okay, let's see how it goes\\"...and it didn't go terribly well. The dialogue was obviously read at different times by different people. At times you can hear the editing. A conversation supposedly in the same room sounds as though one person is in a bathroom while the other outside the door. Perhaps it's not the best analogy, but you get the idea.<br /><br />Then, just as you've gotten used to the voices, the book switches into single-reader format, with one person reading and doing all the dialogue. I've not quite been able to fathom why and when it is supposed to happen. At first I thought it might be in alternating chapters, but it isn't.<br /><br />The major problem with this is that you get used to hearing someone and then it changes. You hear a woman speaking in a woman's voice. A short time later her lines are being read by a male reader. A little further on it's back to the woman. With a diverse cast of readers and different accents, it gets really confusing.<br /><br />I could have lived with multiple readers, editing issues and all if the publishers had stuck to that format and not moved back and forth between single/multiple readers. I can find no explanation as to why they did this. On the Macmillan website are lots of testimonials notes and a \\"how they did it\\" video but nothing to explain the discrepancy.<br /><br />And surely they must have realized that Baron Harkonnen sounds almost exectly the same as Darth Vader...come on guys...<br /><br />So - listener be warned. You might want to have read the book first because the voice mix-up may throw you a curve ball.<br /><br />It's a pity that the presentation in this case has tarnished what should have been a very worthwhile effort. I'm giving it 2 stars because of the story, but only 2 stars because of the presentation. I am very glad I didn't pay full retail for it because at close to $60 it would have been a very expensive disappointment.of testimonials notes and a \\"how they did it\\" video but nothing to explain the discrepancy.

B001C4CI8A|3.0|Although the acting is great and the story compelling, I felt I had seen this movie once or twice before more or less. Oh that's right, I saw [[ASIN:B001FZSKM4 Traitor (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B000IYV1ME Syriana [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B001UGIIMA Spy Game [Blu-ray]]], and maybe a a couple others with parts of this movie in them. To be honest I'm getting tired of this story. If it wasn't for the great production values and acting I probably would have given it two stars because this plotline is getting old. If you liked this check out the other movies I mentioned above.<br /><br />CA Luster
1401216676|5.0|This is a great, edgy read. It's hard hitting and maniacal, and no doubt a milestone in the medium. It's also very compelling, certainly the type of book you'll read in one sitting.     The story is psychologically intense and contains scenes of derangement that are a little chilling. It goes into territory that is a very serious, very dark arena.    And the joke at the end is a killer ...
1400079179|5.0|I read this book when it first came out after reading Dan Brown's Demons and Angels...I loved both of them and am looking forward to reading his new book.  I never understood what all the uproar was about?  It is FICTION and was never touted as being anything else by the author.  The media is what started all the controversy.
B0026GBIB6|5.0|This is an excellent album - and it was worth every penny of my $3.99 - Thanks, Amazon! Like U2, these boys have been around awhile and are still making excellent music. I applaud them for challenging themselves and their listeners. This band sounds in top form, and it seems like Dave Gahan  pulls no punches when singing about his conquered demons. This is a 9 out of 10! i can't wait to see them on tour!
1416914307|5.0|For me this book was a satisfying end to a wonderful series.  I really do not think the Mortal Instruments series has gotten as much buzz as it deserves and I highly recommend the entire series.  This books wraps up most of the story lines nicely and you get some action and some romance.  We see the outcome of the tension between Jace and Clary as well as Alec and Magnus.  I will say though that Clary was really getting on my nerves though.  Stop reading here if you do not want any spoilers!<br /><br />I think when Jace was trying to get her to go back to New York and was telling her that she was too impulsive and did not think of the consequences of her actions that he wasn't being just mean.  He was totally right.  I mean come on.  Making the portal to go to Idris wasn't because she needed to go there to save her mother.  It was because she was throwing a temper tantrum about being left behind.  Forget the fact that it was possible Jace could have tried to get the potion to save her mother, or that it was against the law for her to go there along or that it could get the others in trouble.  Then to make it worse, once she got there she throws another temper tantrum when Luke's sister tells her she shouldn't go look for Jace and does it anyway.  I really do think Clary was just really lucky things worked out for her.<br /><br />Wow, that turned into a rant but really this book was awesome and I am glad Clary and Jace and Alec and Magnus end up together.

B000VNMS4W|5.0|Juan Luis Guerra is my favorite singer, and I live in the Dominican Republic.  I love his songs, both the music and the lyrics.

B000VFGQUC|4.0|Phil, Brian, Brian and Scott can all PLAY!.  Wow.  I am a huge fan of Thin Lizzy, and the twin guitar sound.    The energy just pours off of these 4 Cats, and the show was awesome.    Problem is, the sound is horrible. I have a high end stereo system, and neither the stereo nor the 5.1 mix sounds any better than a bassy muddy mess.  The sound comes mostly from the middle speaker in 5.1, and the guitars are not separated well.      Great video, great playing, the sound reproduction is poor.
B00004YW6I|5.0|This is the best thing she's ever done and probably ever will, and \\"Is this desire?\\" is the runner-up.

Oh yeah, she's cool, aloof and mysterious and all of that, but she needs to get back to doing what she did on this release.
B001RQ0SJO|5.0|Seven stars! The music press is abuzz with Natasha Kahn as heir apparent to the genre inhabited by Kate Bush, Bjork and other not-so-easily-pigeon-holed femme fatales. To be sure, comparisons are in order, but only as points of reference. My first listen to this spell-binding collection reminded me of the first time I heard Kate Bush's \\"Hounds Of Love\\", a percussion driven, minimally orchestrated production that showcased a spectacular vocal instrument. Like Bush, Khan modulates her voice effortlessly from a whisper to a howl, all while achieving a stratospheric range, as in the opener \\"Glass.\\" She also has an appreciation for \\"less is more\\" in her instrumental arrangements. On some, synths glisten above and rumble below primal drumming and beguiling multi-track vocal splashes. On others, a simple piano accompaniment is all that's needed.  All of the songs share equal merit (a pleasant surprise, considering the abundance of first-four-song fizzles), and each is thoroughly engaging.  Her lyrics abound in flights of fancy, allusions to knights in crystal armor and emerald cities. While they could easily sound pretentious and precious, as is the case with some of her contemporaries, she breathes them to life as they intertwine with and inhabit each song. In some she conjures deeply insightful moments. She laments in Sleep Alone, \\"lonely, lonely, lonely his mother told me/ the dream of love is a two hearted dream.\\" Or solemnly and perhaps topically in Peace Of Mind, \\"If I ever get back down / find a map that takes me back / through the wounded, through the wars / to a time that came before\\" And the poignant and perhaps self referent  Traveling Woman, the most moving song of the set, \\"Never fall in love with potential / `cause you can't see it with your own eyes / All the pretty faces and sorry words / can take away your pride.\\" Natasha Khan's world is full of pride and potential. May those qualities guide her through what promises to be a long and fruitful journey. I eagerly await the next step.
0060558121|5.0|British born Neil Gaiman (who now lives in America) has written what is considered one of the greatest modern American novels. American Gods, winner of multiple awards, utilizes mythology, urban and rural landscapes, and magic realism to ask the questions of what does it mean to be an American and how has the concept of \\"being an American\\" changed over time? Don't think for once that this novel is about patriotism. These questions bubble out of the violent war between the old world gods and the modern day gods (e.g., Media and Internet) that have controlled the landscape. In the middle of this war is Shadow, an ex-convict, betrayed by his cheating (now dead) wife and best friend. Looking for work, Shadow becomes the bodyguard of Mr. Wednesday, who we later learn is one of the old gods, Odin. As they travel across America, we get a darker vision of America - a land that feels like a tortured soul having trouble finding its sense of \\"self.\\" What makes this book so intriguing is Mr. Gaiman's ability create characters that feel very real and alive, including the landscape. I'm fascinated by his parallel of the characteristics between Shadow and the American landscape. Sacrifices are made at the end, but for whom? And, do the sacrifices make any difference to humanity and the future of America?

0786852550|5.0|In an attempt to fill the hole of the now complete Harry Potter Series, I came across English writer Jonathan Stroud's The Amulet of Samarkand (\\"The Amulet\\"), and I soon fell in love with the whole Bartimaeus Trilogy.  The Amulet takes place in a world where magicians rule the UK and everyone one else - those who are unable to perform magic - are subjected to unfair and sometimes cruel laws.      The series opens with two anti-heroes: 11-year old Nathaniel, whose parents hand him over to become an apprentice of a second-rate magician - Underwood - and a 5,000-year old sarcastic, self-absorbed djinni named Bartimaeus who seeks freedom.  Readers soon learn that Nathaniel has ambitions of his own and becomes disillusioned and bitter over Underwood's mediocre power.  Further, Nathaniel receives a fatal blow to his esteem when he is callously punished for insulting Simon Lovelace - a power hungry and political magician. Without giving too much away of the plot, Nathaniel conjures Bartimaeus to seek revenge against Lovelace, including stealing and hiding the powerful Amulet of Samarkand from Lovelace.  Both Nathaniel and Bartimaeus are \\"in it\\" for themselves but must work together to accomplish.  From there on out, the plot becomes an often dark, humorous, and even political ride (wait until the Resistance appears!) that no reader should miss.     I thoroughly enjoyed The Amulet and the remaining series because the heroes are not the stereotypical \\"nice guy/gal\\" types.  They are flawed, sometimes self-absorbed, heroes who have an edge that at any moment they could fall into their darker nature.    Also what is stellar about this series in the not-so-basic political and economic issues that occur between the \\"haves\\" and \\"have-nots.\\"  These are great issues to pursue in conversations among adults, young adults, or book clubs that involve both adults and young adults.
0738711500|4.0|I love these cards; the artwork is stunning! This deck will always be important to me. I learned alot from the book and felt it was very appropriate for the tarot novice. The Gilded is a good choice of deck to learn with. My only problem is that my readings with it have never been better than so-so. I thought it was me until I started collecting other decks and get better readings with almost every other one. I can't explain it but there it is. I truly love this deck though.
B001O54NHQ|4.0|Prince's 1989 soundtrack to the Tim Burton blockbuster remains an engaging romp with some killer cuts. &#34;The Future,&#34; &#34;Electric Chair&#34; and &#34;Vicki Waiting&#34; are definite highlights while &#34;Scandalous&#34; emerges as one of the artist's truly stellar ballads. &#34;Partyman&#34; and &#34;Trust&#34; deliver the funk, but the energetic &#34;Lemon Crush&#34; is a definite throwaway. Though &#34;Batdance&#34; reached the top of the charts, it exists primarily as a novelty single. The only misfire is &#34;Arms of Orion&#34; — a pretentious duet with Sheena Easton that doesn't belong on any Prince album. When considering the rushed nature of production (most songs were recorded in six weeks), &#34;Batman&#34; holds up surprisingly well.
1572816295|5.0|I bonded instantly with this deck. The beautiful figures and colors swirled around in a playful fantasy world. The colors are light, soothing and very positive. But this deck is no lightweight. Tarot symbolism is displayed on every card and is easily interpreted without having a book constantly by the side. There were some intuitive insights in the artwork as well. So many in fact that I'm hoping there will be a book to go with this deck someday. Hint!
6304696515|5.0|[[ASIN:6304696515 Dangerous Liaisons]]  I have seen this movie before and decided to buy it for my library.  I like historic movies that have bite and this one has it.  First of all, the actors are superb in the roles they play.  Everyone romanticizes the 17th, early 18th century.  An era of fancy dressed men and pompadour women of the elite class.  The ideaology of the time, the mind-set, and philosphy of those times is starkly portrayed.  Not so romantic in the reality of false and rediculous etiquette and values.

B0002BO05S|3.0|My favorite thing about this film was Charlton Heston as John the Baptist. I thought he was great, but the rest of the characters, hmmm I don't know if they meant to potray the life of Christ that way. But I do agree the King of Kings was better and  will always be my favorite film about Christ. But I also love Jesus of Nazareth.

0316168815|5.0|To be honest, when I picked this book up I thought it was going to blow. The reviews I had read in the past and the summaries I had gotten from friends made The Lovely Bones sound like an Elsewhere knock off. Nonetheless I picked it up and read it.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones was very different from Elsewhere in a good way. Instead of being focused mainly on Heaven and what goes on there, the setting of LB was on Earth.<br /><br />Throughout the book we got to see Suzie Salmon's family heal from her murder. We see her younger sister, Lindsey, grow up fast by keeping her greif locked in tight. We see her father hold on to her memory by searching for her killer, while losing sight of his present. We see her mother become scared and distant. We see her little brother, Buckly, wait hopefully for Suzie's return, and learning the meaning of gone. We also watch Suzie yearn for Earth and the boy who stole her first kiss.<br /><br />Read The Lovely Bones, you won't regret it.

B001GCUNYO|5.0|Who would have ever thought that Hollywood would attempt to include an important topic to serve as the basis for one of its typically generic, yet entertaining action films? Generally these films are created to provide mindless escapism along with a hefty dose of guns and fist-fights, or just to be another brainless vehicle showcasing the action star of the moment. In the case of \\"Taken\\", a much more serious topic, the trafficking of women, serves as the catalyst for all the mayhem that ensues over the course of the film.    \\"Taken\\" is the story of a young girl named Kim (Maggie Grace), who takes a trip to France with a friend for the summer; however, what should have been a trip filled with good times and fond memories, turns horribly wrong when they are kidnapped for the sole purpose of being sold into a dark underworld of sex and drugs. What the kidnappers didn't count on was that Kim's father, Bryan (Liam Neeson), is a man of rather \\"special\\" talents that he learned during his time spent working as a spy for the United States government. With his daughter's life in jeopardy, Bryan must call upon every deadly skill he's ever learned to track down those responsible and save his daughter before it's too late.    Filmmaker and writer Luc Besson (\\"Transporter\\" series) has made a career out of delivering to audiences bone crushing, overly stylized and over-the-top action movies that entertain us, but don't really give us anything new in terms of story or emotional range. With \\"Taken\\" Luc Besson, along with co-writer Robert Mark Kamen (\\"Transporter 2\\"), imbues the story with a much more serious, emotionally charged backbone. The seedy underworld of kidnapping and trafficking women for sex is one that exists without a whole lot of attention being called to it, thus making this film's message all the more important. The story is wisely written in such a way that it gives us just enough of a glimpse into this world that we become more enlightened as too some of the new threats out there, but not so graphic that the film is too shocking for most people to see. By handling the subject matter in this somewhat delicate manner, some would say it just glossed over the evil done in this so-called \\"business\\", but the message is able to reach a much broader spectrum of people than a harder edged movie would have been able to. For those feeling that the film didn't do enough to expose the despicable nature of this world, I do agree, but I understand why it was a better decision not to go too far with it. Because to go too hard and gritty with this movie by being too explicit, you run the risk of limiting and/or alienating your audience, which is not something you want when dealing with such a serious topic.    Even with the much heftier subject matter, \\"Taken\\" still could have run the risk of being just a slightly above average action movie if not for the considerable talents of star Liam Neeson. Liam brings to the character of Bryan a gentleness and an obvious love for his daughter in the early portion of the movie, so that when the rubber really hits the road, the actions he takes to find her, and the ferocity in which he acts is completely believable. Regardless of how brutal Bryan may act towards these undeniably deserving adversaries, he never becomes inaccessible to the audience. This is because Liam's gravitas and at times emotional performance keeps the audience invested in his character and his mission. Sometimes in an action movie, the action can become too front and center that the how's and why's of the story (no matter how important and central they may be to the action) get forgotten about until the very end when they are conveniently re-introduced to the audience as a reminder. For \\"Taken\\" this is not the case, as Bryan's love for his daughter and unwillingness to give up on finding her always remains front and center, even during the action sequences.    Other members of the cast included Famke Janssen (\\"X-Men\\" trilogy), Maggie Grace (\\"The Fog\\"), and Leland Orser (\\"The Bone Collector\\"). Each of these supporting actors and actresses do a good job with the little time they do receive onscreen. Primarily this movie belongs solely to Liam Neeson, while the supporting roles are nothing more than glorified cameos, which suits this type of film perfectly. Out of the supporting cast, Maggie Grace probably gives the best performance, because had it not been for her emotional connection with Liam in the film's early scenes, the audience wouldn't have been able to connect with him as much later on. Sure, the story would have still impacted us in some way, but by having their relationship feel so realistic, it made our connection to him throughout the remainder of the film all the more palpable.    Lastly, first time director Pierre Morel brings his keen eye for action to the proceedings with great effectiveness. Pierre's work as Director of Cinematography on the action film \\"War\\", starring Jet Li and Jason Statham, clearly served as great preparation for his work on this film. While I didn't enjoy the aforementioned film all that much, the action scenes were handled very well, much the same way as they are here. Unlike many of writer Luc Besson's action films, \\"Taken\\" contains none of his trademark over-the-top, overblown action sequences that while incredibly fun to watch, are completely unbelievable. Instead, Pierre opts to keep the action realistic and up-close and personal, while still providing plenty of hard-hitting, fast-paced (somewhat stylized) fight sequences, that don't really feel all that unbelievable or obviously choreographed.    \\"Taken\\" is a great action film that offers plenty of violence for the action junkies, while at the same time providing some solid acting, and a story that shines a light on a dark world that needs to be exposed and put to an end.    \\"Taken\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.
0446579939|4.0|As with all of Nicholas Sparks' books, this one didn't disappoint either.  The story keeps you interested until the end.  The characters are rich and you can forget about yourself and become one with them.  Its a good contemporary story but not the usual love story.  I would recommend it to everyone and plan to pass my book along to my friends.
031606792X|5.0|I am a lot older than the recommended age for reading this book.  When told about it I laughed, thinking how ridiculous.  Then just to see what every one of my friends were saying about this book I read Twilight, POW, I was hooked.  Wonderfully written, captivating characters, interesting story line, all you could want in a MAKE-BELIEVE book.  I read all four books in record time and thoroughtly enjoyed each and everyone.  I am glad Bella's life turned out like she wanted it, I am glad she got everything she wanted, I am glad the series ended with so much happiness, because it is FANTASY!!  That is why I read it, it takes you away from reality and for awhile you get to live in a non-existent world where non-existent creatures and people do not live.    For all those who gave this a bad review, evidently, you forgot that this was books about vampires and werewolves and a girl who fell for a vampire and he for her, it was FANTASY.  Accept it for what it was and enjoy it.  Life doesn't always turn out like we want but in these kind of books they can be whatever they want to be.  I loved them and I hate to admit it because I laughed at my friends for getting so involved in a book about vampires.  But it gave me a great release from reality and gave me a whirlwind of a ride, thanks Stephenie!!
B001P5Q6F2|4.0|Riding off the success of 'Walk With Me In Hell' LOG return with 'Wrath' an album filled with straight up metal. But to my great surprise I find the album a bit boring and unforfilling. Obviously most people find this album to be spectacular. An evolution in what is LOG. I find them playing safe with material that will go over well for most listeners. The spark that made LOG original is now gone. There is nothing on the album that stands apart from the consistent pummeling and great musicianship. Remember this is LOG they will always produce something that is solid..........but is 'Wrath' groundbreaking? Not even close.       The album lacks any hooks that 'Sacrament' had. And lacks any great arrangements that 'Ashes' had. There really is nothing memorable on 'Wrath'. I even hate to say that I find it difficult to get through the album. Even the bonus tracks I got from buying the limited edition through Bestbuy are forgettable.       So far nothing will touch the masterpiece that was 2004's 'Ashes Of The Wake'. Give that one a spin again and you will see what I'm talking about.
0060512806|4.0|Before Crypotnomicon I had never read any of Neal Stephenson's novels. Throughout the book I was impressed as the wild array of story lines coming from different times and many different characters slowly wove together, so I was impressed by the quality of the writing and the technical side of it.<br /><br />The only shortcoming was, in my opinion, the ending. For a novel of this breadth, the climax should be pretty extraordinary and satisfying, after having built for so long. Instead the final bit left me feeling a little hollow.<br /><br />That said, some might say that it's not in the destination but how you get there. Crytonomicon exceeds in that aspect. It's worth reading just for the ride. Both the technical and the human sides of the story will keep you reading (and wanting more) right through the end.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|My favorite CD since I got Amy Winehouse's Back in Black last year. The entire album is great and sets a wonderful mood for cooking, painting or a quiet evening. My favorite song is Warwick Avenue, but this is one of the few albums I own where I like every song on it. Her voice has a wonderful quality to it and the lyrics tell great love stories, very Billie Holiday. If you like Amy Winehouse, Norah Jones, Joss Stone... you will love this.
B000XEIVG8|5.0|In support of \\"Powerslave,\\" Iron Maiden hit the road and realized that they were firing on all cylinders, and that if they ever really wanted to capture their true sound and nature they would have to record a live album and video. With the over-the-top stage set and large catalogue of epic songs they had in tow, now was the time to do it and do it right.<br /><br />I am NOT a fan of live albums. I usually like a band's studio- produced work, because to me a live album is kind of like taking a picture of an artist's work at the museum. You can't see all the details the artist intended. However, some bands' true sound and vibe just can't be captured in a studio and Iron Maiden happens to be one of those bands.<br /><br />Their records are amazing, but for some reason they don't justifiably hold the true essence that makes Maiden so good and unique: that being the well-oiled-machine sound and theatre-like quality Maiden produce live.<br /><br />\\"Live After Death\\" caught Maiden at a wonderful moment in their career and is a very clear representation of their genuine talent. I am sure the audience reading this review agrees that many acts today just don't have the authentic talent that bands like Maiden do.<br /><br />If you want to hear Iron Maiden the way they were meant to be heard, raw, uncut, charged up, and showing off, then buy this record. If you want a piece of history, this album should be in your collection. If you want to hear \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\" live, then buy this record. And finally, I can't think of a reason why you shouldn't own this album. So buy it already!!!
0312427646|4.0|The dogs started barking as they ran towards the bookmobile. The Queen was surprised and walked over and out of courtesy checks out a book. From here Mr. Bennett's novella describes how the Queen starts neglecting her royal duties as her outlook is expanded as she reads more and more books. Of course not everyone is pleased with all her reading and using underhanded methods, they cause books to be displaced and even secretly shipped her amanuensis to East Anglia.<br /><br />This literary work of art, only 120 pages, is gracefully written and raises the curtain to allow light to shine on what the restricted life of a monarch must be like. The Queen quickly learned to hide books under cushions and other places; even how to keep a book lower than the carriage window so she could read as she waved while riding to parliament.<br /><br />I recommend this heart warming and humorous read for all.<br /><br />Author al-Qaeda Strikes Again

In The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle reminds us that our inner voice \\"comments, speculates, judges, compares, complains\\" and that this voice isn't necessarily relevant to our present situation.  We revive past wrongs, or rehearse and imagine future outcomes that drain our vital energy. Tolle teaches us how to quiet the mind - our unconscious resistance to what is - and instead focus our attention into the now. May his powerful message help you understand that the present moment is all you ever have. And moreover may you learn to quiet any desperation in your life, and live in peace.
B0010VD7EO|3.0|I don't know who their mixer was but they did a very poor job mixing the sound.  The tracks seem distorted and you can only turn up the volume so loud without hurting your ears.  It doesn't seem to be the performances, which are good.  Check out the Live from Abbey Road performances instead.
0399250395|5.0|This is one of my daughter's favorite books so I couldn't resist buying this adorable pop up book!  It is SO well done and she LOVES it when I read it to her.  Since she is only 1, I don't leave it out for her to look at on her own as she would naturally be to tempted to rip the pop ups out. Would make a great gift.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I've owned this album for many months and I still never tire of listening to it.  The more you listen, the more subtleties you find.  Sound quality is very good and the performances are right on.      My only complaint is I don't like the paper packaging - I'm always fumbling to put the cd and extras in the paper case the right way up, while driving.  Plastic would have been better.
0060849827|5.0|A great book for someone who likes the outdoors and survival techniques.  Compact enough for pocket/backpack.  Many useful diagrams including plants, animal tracks, how to skin an animal, fire building and cooking, knots and ropes, map reading, traps, weapons, first aid, etc.  Alot(!) of information in a small book.
B00004VYOR|3.0|This Bond movie has just one basic flaw but utterly irritating: why should non Anglo-Saxon characters (here most are Russian) speak English among themselvels when no Anglo-Saxon is present and with an awful accent at that?<br />This is silly and irritating. Either you let them speak their language with subtitles or, if you think viewers will be annoyed by having to read, you let them speak plain English: otherwise one must think that non-natives alway speak in a language foreign to them just for the heck of producing guttural sounds.<br /><br />As for the rest it is one of the best bond movies I can recall: action packed, well scripted (not always a given with Bond movies), well acted (Brosnan is good) and interesting in its assumptions.<br /><br />Children are best kept out of it unless it is with a parent ready to do a lot of explaining.
B000059TCE|5.0|I would recommend ordering from this seller it had really fast shipping and the dvd played perfectely just like it said it would
B0011NVC98|3.0|I admit I did not expect much from this film and bought it at bargain price much after it came out in dvd just to see the state of the art in animation of adventure stories, not to mention that as an amateur linguist specialised in Germanic languages I was also ready to have to shut ears, eyes and brain not to be too appalled.<br /><br />Well, I got more than I bargained for.<br /><br />In a strange, elusive way this film manages to portray rather faithfully what my imagination has depicted as the Germanic world of the X century or whereabouts (I know, I know, Beowulf is older than that but who cares): primitive and rough but not entirely devoid of cultural refinement (the queen's songs); cruel and violent but not illogical. Authors must have done some research and they have done it well.<br /><br />The plotline is very simple but not silly and the many well executed action scenes are aptily counterpointed by more intimate ones where the basic needs and flaws of human beings are highlighted, first and foremost the choice of Beowulf to give in to the demon's allurement. This is too very faithful to what I consider to be the spirit of that distant age as are the final scenes when we see Beowulf reach out for the beautiful (and dying) demon son he has just slaughtered or when we see Angelina -the demoness- Jolie kiss for the second and last time the man she may have really loved.<br /><br />With the only exception of an Angelina Jolie in her prime who could have possibly outshone any animated replica of herself the other actors profit from the animation device. First and foremost Ray Winstone who, in the film, is simply gorgeous: it's far too easy to forget we are not facing a real body there. Beowulf, even in his old age, is nearly as alluring as the demoness, this effect being the sum of a competent actor (Winstone) given the body and charm of a world class model, which is quite an interesting possibility.<br /><br />All in all a good film: possibly too difficult and gloomy to please kids and simpler audiences but well scripted, well acted and entertaining.gloomy to please kids and simpler audiences but well scripted, well acted and entertaining.

1603580557|5.0|I first encountered systems analysis when I was at Cape Canaveral during the several years leading to the moon landings. The concept of systems seemed so useful that I was quickly sold on its value. But today, there are still many persons in business and government who are unaware of the power of systems analysis. This is the beauty of this small volume. It is the best and clearest introduction to systems that I have seen. Why is knowledge of systems important? Because each of us is surrounded by and enmeshed in systems. Our nation is a hugely-complex system, as are our cities, businesses, schools, organizations, and even ourselves. A human body is a wonderfully-complex system, and even a single, living cell is a system of incredible complexity. Dr. Meadows begins with the principal systems concepts, including stocks, flows, time graphs, reinforcing and balancing loops, and the concept of feedback control, all shown with excellent diagrams. Next, she describes and gives examples of how systems work. Finally, she discusses how we can use systems analysis in making decisions about complex problems (because the complex problem is likely to involve a complex system). The writing and explanations are a pleasure to read.
0930289234|4.0|I'd read part of the Watchmen story many years ago.  I think I started somewhat in the middle of the story and was a little confused as to what was going on and who each character was and what the motives were.  Reading it all the way through, I can see the potential for confusion just jumping in.  There were a few times where the various threads were a little confusing, but generally everything is presented in a very interesting and accessible way.<br /><br />The artwork and the story line are wonderful.  I really enjoyed the organizational style of the book.  At times it felt a little soap-opera-esque in that there were three or four fairly core story threads all happening simultaneously and the narrative bounced around quickly between them.<br /><br />Through the presentation and organization, I was able to determine the mystery antagonist early on.  And yet, even knowing who was responsible, I couldn't put my finger on the motive or exactly how everything was going to play out.  The story has sooo many elements working together and playing with one another.  When everything came together, I was definitely shocked and surprised by the motives and the way the finality was organized.  I also felt that most of my questions were answered but that there were still a few loose threads I'm not quite sure about.<br /><br />Still, in one of the stranger and more allegorical threads, it ended with a line something like \\"I have to keep re-reading everything because I don't understand what happened.\\"  To me, I found that particular plot thread to be a metafictional commentary on the plot of the book as a whole.  By ending it in that way, I think the authors are telling me that they expect me to come away confused on the first reading, but to get more insight with subsequent reads.  And looking back in my mind at the material I read, I can see where that could be true.<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed this story.  I've really enjoyed most everything I've read from Moore.  Hisstories are creative and thought provoking.  Sometimes a little more extreme than I might ordinarily seek out, but I still come away from his books with new thoughts in my head.  I'm still bummed that the movie got an \\"R\\" rating.  I can see where the director would have liked to have pushed for the \\"R\\", but at the same time, I can see where some conscious choices could have kept it at a solid \\"PG-13\\"  (I personally feel that the novel itself is closer to PG-13 than R, but that could be the desensitized Okie talking).<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of those graphic novels that deserves the accolades it's received.  I can't necessarily recommend it to everyone because I know there are those who will be put off either by its theme or by the media (...those who say \\"it's just a comic book\\").  But to those who are willing to stretch their reading opinions and their sensitivities, I definitely recommend this book.<br /><br />****<br />4 stars (out of 5)
6305744793|5.0|Whenever you ask anyone that just comes to to know me for even a small amount of time which is my favorite movie of all times, they tell you without even hesitating: The Addams Family.<br /><br />I saw this movie when I was a little girl and can proudly say even now over 15 years later it is my favorite movie.<br /><br />You get black humor, sarcasm, but all in a very light way. This people (the addams') and definetely not your next door neighbor *sighs sadly* and will do this unbelivable stuff one will never be able to do, like electrocute your brother, pay absolutely everything with gold dobloons, have a friend (servant, family member ???) with consist of only a bare hand that walks around the house etc. LOL!<br /><br />All characters were cast PERFECTLY. Both Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia seem to have been born for their roles (such a shame Raul past out without even doing a 3rd sequel).<br /><br />This is not a tipical comedy movie, nor is it a horror or dramatic movie, however it is always fun to watch both Morticia and Gomez all over the love they have for each other, getting over excited with \\"their\\" wheel of torture, red hot pokers etc.<br /><br />And great movie quotes:<br /><br />\\"Gomez, last night you were unhinged, you were like some deseperate, howling demon.

B000YDDUKA|5.0|This is by far my favorite Eagles album,yes it includes the radio staples Lyin' Eyes,Take It To The Limit and the classic title track that were played to death on the radio,great song sbut the real reason I bought this is for Journey Of The Sorcerer,a very incredible instumental that shows the chops of all the band members,it features strings as well,it did get some airplay but has NEVER been on any of their best of compilations,one of the graet sleeper tracks of 1975(Fire On High by ELO is another one!),After The Thrill Is Gone is another underated classic,although it;s been on some of the hit;s packages,this is the band's best album in my opinion although thie next LP/CD Hotel California got all those Grammys,it's a 5 star album also,but I like this one more!!!

0307450570|3.0|As with all Martha tomes, dazzling eye-candy photography grabs the reader.  This work is no exception.      The crafts Martha Stewart's Living magazine has been touting over the years(e.g. soapmaking, candlemaking, decoupage, wreaths, botanical pressing and printing) are here.    Some of the newer entries are marbleizing, nature crafts, quilling and origami.    Calligraphy, matting and framing are out of place in an encyclopedia of crafting.  Calligraphy is an elegant form of writing and can't technically be called a craft.  Matting and framing reproductions, photographs and needlework items are a skill that takes its place as a \\"finishing touch.\\"    The mosaics chapter needed more clarification on just how to fit tiny pieces of tile together into a cohesive design.    Justifying the three-star rating, no chapter existed on the needle arts -- sewing, crewel, needlepoint, knitting, crochet, and embroidery in all its forms.    But, the title was right in one regard.  This book will provide \\"endless inspiration\\" for any crafter perusing its pages.

0439023483|1.0|This book had my attention and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  However, I was very disappointed.  When I closed the book for the last time I was amazed at what a bad example the main character is for young adults.  She lies, she does what ever her superiors ask her to do including get naked for men and women alike, she'll kill other teens, she'll profess her love and kiss someone she doesn't really love all just so she can succeed in the game.  She has no morals, integrity, or values.  All she wants to do is live through the games and will stop at next to nothing to do this.  Where is the heroism in this?  I felt the author was trying to teach young adults particularly girls that when it comes to succeeding in this life everything is fair game (using their bodies, phony romantic relationships, deceit, and popularity).  These are not the kind of things I want my children doing to gain worldly success.  I was disgusted with the book and hope none of my children ever read it.
0307269752|5.0|Three words describe this book succinctly: Terrific, Terrific, and Terrific. One of the best books I have read in years. Superb characters, a wide ranging series of events over a long period of time, and several layers of activities involving the various character with several culminations as well. Lisabeth Salander is certainly one of the most unusual characters I've ever run into. Strange, compelling, evoking, and unique, to put it mildly. Blomkvist, Vanger, Berger et. al. combine here to cohere a most excellent novel. I cannot emphasize strongly enough the degree of satisfaction this novel brings with itself. I immediately ordered, received, and read the 2nd book in the trilogy, The Girl Who Played with Fire, in that order. That review is one step beyond this writing however, I eagerly await the release of the 3rd and final book here in the US, The Girl Who Stirred the Hornet's Nest. Unfortunately, the author, Stieg Larsson, died shortly after finishing these three novels. Incredible! An excellent read, highly recommended. I give it 5 stars.

1402210086|2.0|These Casablanca/Sourcebooks editions of Georgette Heyer's works are a major disappointment to one who has collected Heyer for years. They're a nice big size, have terrific artwork on the covers, and there is a very small number of typos, for which I am grateful. However, the paper used is of such terrible quality that I expect to have to replace the books within a few years. It is unpleasant to touch, as well. The cover art is identified nowhere, which strikes me as impolite at best. Of course, none of the art is actual Regency work; it appears to be Victorian (or later) impressions of the Regency, so maybe the publisher didn't want the readers to know where it came from! I am replacing as few of my Heyers as possible with these editions.

0345495004|1.0|Well I tried to get into this book but in my opinion it was boring and sometimes difficult to understand. I had to keep going back and rereading paragraphs to understand which character had said what.  Maybe it was because the book was so boring to me that I could not concentrate on it. I generally love to read romance/fiction/drama but this book was not for me. I finally stopped reading at page 147 and decided to sell it on ebay.
B001W79MBI|5.0|I saw this movie about 1 year ago. My girlfriend and I are big anime junkies. This one took us by surprise. It is absolutly Amazing. Right after seeing the movie We went out and got the Japanese verison with the english subtitles. I'm really looking forward to the english version due to the voice actors, and slight changes in the script. The action scenes are fast paced and very detailed. I hope someone is making the weapons used in this movie, cause i would love to collect a few chosen worrors weapons. The way these worrors handle there weapons as well as the way they move are well beautifuly put together. The story line is solid, with a few jokes from time to time. All and All I say if your an Anime Junkie like myself, and love to see a great story line, with some seriously mind blowling acton scenes. Then i suggest this movie.

B001QTMRXM|2.0|I have been an avid Delain fan after snagging their first album, \\"Lucidity.\\"  That album is perfect.  Charlotte's voice is beautiful and uplifting, and the songs are heavy and catchy.  Wonderful, wonderful album!  I waited on the edge of my seat for their second release, \\"April Rain,\\" and when I finally did manage to get my hands on it, I found myself feeling remarkably disappointed... perhaps even betrayed!    This album is nothing like Lucidity.  The songs are flat and unremarkable.  I had a hard time discerning one track from another; they all sound the same!  It almost seems like Delain is trying too hard for that 'Evanescence'-type sound and straying away from their true metal roots that made them so popular.  I've given this album multiple listens and still can't find a good thing to say about it.  The title track, April Rain, is the only standout moment from the album, and even then it doesn't come close to any of the tracks from Lucidity.    I have to ask you again, Delain... what happened?    -- A very disappointed fan
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Although this film was released in 1982, in my opinion, it continues to stand the test of time.  It's perfect on so many different levels of production.  And to think that it took Richard Attenborough about 20 years to complete this film...it was definitely worth the time, dedication and wait.  You rarely see motion pictures with pure; artistic vision anymore.  Especially in this day and age of \\"blockbuster sequels, lewd; comedic antics and c.g.i crazed effects\\".    Audiences just don't want to be challenged anymore...how sad.

044024367X|1.0|Wish I had read the other reviews instead of purchasing this.<br />Once upon a time, Jack Reacher was a hero. Ex-MP, military career man, took his word seriously, treated everyone fairly and with an open mind, and lived with a code of honor.<br />The years have not been kind and now we find him as a wretched remnant of the man that he once was. Of course, one must look at his creator, Lee Child, and see a mirror of the sad phenomenon which appears to afflict many writers, actors and others who become successful and then fall victim to the hubris bred by being told how great they are by their newly found friends, the political leftists... suddenly, they find new platforms from which their characters must speak, new causes to espouse, and new ways to mock and ridicule the values held by those who actually made them wealthy.<br />Examples - in the earlier books, Reacher was a straight forward, honest fellow; not arrogant or conceited, fairly apolitical, and given to keeping his word. But by the time of this story, he has become a leftist, an outspoken atheist, and a liar when it suits his purposes, Oh,  and the author finds it necessary for the only 'bad guys' in the book to be a Christian preacher and the US military 'evil war machine'. He unceasingly stresses how vile they both are. He DOES give another portrayal of a minister, an ignorant and befuddled Anglican who smiles like an idiot, has no idea of his theology and apparently drifts through life in a benevolent stupor.<br />Reacher is now decidedly macho, in his relationship with the young female lead, telling her - late in the story, after she has voiced regrets for a spontaneous physical relationship between them - that she isn't REALLY sorry and that she WILL do it again, with him,right now! Quite condescending and sexist and... macho in the most repugnant sense of the word.<br />And of course ( SPOILER... as if THAT matters! ) the \\"good guys' of the book are war deserters, whom Reacher praises, and understands their deep seated confusion, etc. - and the people who smuggle them out of the US to Canada. The US government, naturally, is also carrying out all kinds of secret, underhanded schemes involving depleted uranium and other such drivel, but overall, Reacher has just become a semi-male, castrati  version of Code Pink in janitorial drag.<br />Two notes:<br /><br /> ONE - it is apparent that some authors try to continue with a character or a series after it should have ended. Perhaps they grow tired, perhaps they run out of ideas. Nothing wrong with that. But they should have the integrity to let their heroes fade into the sunset, heads held high, sense of honor and dignity intact. Reacher should have taken a dirt nap a while back, or quietly vanished. Repairman Jack is heading the same way, and the ONLY series to remain strong and plot-driven is the Swagger family series written by the phenomenal author Stephen Hunter. Those tales hold up through the years, and the characters remain lucid and honorable.<br /><br />TWO - If Mr. Child wanted an air of authenticity about his character, he could have asked ANY vet who served for 13 + years in the services, what the vet thinks of deserters. I can assure you that the words 'gutless' and 'bastards' would be the mildest terms that he would hear applied.<br /><br />Final recommendation: go back and read earlier Reachers, or early Repairman Jacks, or ANY of Stephen Hunter's Swagger books...or else just give your money to some poor homeless hungry person. Anything is better than spending it on this waste of trees and ink.confusion, etc. - and the people who smuggle them out of the US to Canada.

B001MWGZBS|2.0|This is for the vinyl pressing, stay away from it.  I picked up a copy and side 1 was ok, with minimal surface noise but side 2 was popping and clicking all over the place and even got very distorted at times making me think the pressing was off.  Anyway, this is the sad state of vinyl today, no quality control. Get this instead on CD and enjoy the yucky digital compressed sound, or get the MP3 if you you just don't care about music quality at all.
B000YABYLA|5.0|I initially avoided Juno because I thought it would somehow romanticize teenage pregnancy and thus fail to discuss the impact on the child.  I could not have been more wrong.    Juno is sincere, touching, occassionally sad, frequently hilarious.  The two teens involved are good kids, Juno's parents are good people and no one falls in to an anticipated stereotype.  The characters are well written and splendidly acted.    And should you wonder, abortion is considered, and ultimately rejected.  Juno's solution, finding a childless couple looking to adopt, would probably not work in the real-world(life is rarely so convenient), but works well on film.    No matter where you fall on the issues of teenage pregnancy, abortion, etc., I still recommend this movie without reservation.  It's about two decent kids who made a huge life mistake and now have to accept the consequences, which they do while avoiding sentimentality, political or religious bias, and so forth.  Ellen Page is terrific as the smart, sarcastic and overwhelmed by pregnancy Juno.    Plus the soundtrack is great!
B000YQBM48|5.0|This is truly her best work. It's very remniscent of alot of disco artists. Espcailly Donna Summer. Most of the tracks have a great electronic groove,yet they also have a disco beat as well. I remember when this album came out in junior high. It was a huge. I never really cared for the single love at first sight, but I loved Can't Get you out of my head. It had been years since I really listened to it, and I forgot how great the beats were beat. Also, this is a very well produced pop album along the lines of Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad, and Madonna's Confessions on  A Dancefloor. More More More, excellent track very great beats. Fever alittle slower, but it work on you. It's reminiscent of a Gwen Stefani type pop song. Can't get you out of my head and In your eyes have excellent music videos, slick production, and overall a great sound. At first many of us in the us, had never really heard of Kylie Minogue until the media reminded people that she sang the locamotion. Everybody was like wtf? Seriously, but she pretty much took the US by storm at time when most of the pop artists weren't really don't plain pop music. Britney had been out for a while,so had Christina. And Madonna had just gotten old. Overall, this has to be one of her crowning achievements. When she makes good music,she really makes excellent music. This album is around 7 years old, and if anybody doesn't have this album then they should get it!
B001IBIQU6|5.0|When I heard that Depeche Mode was coming back together i was crazy happy and couldn't wait for this album to come out. I stayed up all night long to download it and the wait was well worth it. Perfect Balance of Classic Depeche Mode and some electronica, \\"Peace' has o be the best song of the entire album for me right now. Must buy for any Depeche Mode Fan
B00122J3QC|1.0|So, I've reviewed some other Madonna albums, and some people don't like my reviews. But it's my personal opinion and it seems to go along with most of mainstream America. When this album came it was weird! I thought Madonna had really lost, and that she was about to be a has been. I hadn't been a huge fan of music, but liked ray of light. I was disappointed when I tried to give American Life a chance. It also fell at a bad time as well. The Iraq War was starting, and many Americans were divided on the issue. It propably wouldn't have been smart to release a protest(even thought she claims its not,if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck it must be a duck). I thought Hollywood was weird not really that enjoyable to listen. I found alot of her other tracks to be very boring and not that interesting to listen. I'm just being honest. Madonna crazy fans will bash this i know, but the record sales speak for themselves. (and so did the pop charts). I honestly thought this was the most bizarre album to come out during that time, she really should have crafted her message with better music. If there was better music and less complaining about her life and the war this might have been enjoyable.I really liked Die Another but that came out a year earlier! And the only reason they put it on there was to try to save the album(imo). Oh, there was a decent hidden gem on this album. Nothing Fails was pretty good! Overall, if your a Madonna fan get this,but it's really not that great.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I bought this for a friend's birthday, and only learned later that the subtitles were the \\"dumbed-down\\" version. The movie itself is excellent--video quality and sound are superb. Just make you get the version that has the \\"Original Theatrical Subtitles\\" track. I'd recommend going to an actual physical store, so you can check the packaging for yourself to be sure it's the right version.
B000002OK3|5.0|Great songs! 'I Gotcha' makes me smile every time it comes on. 'Little Green Bag' and 'Fool For Love' are great too!
B0019HQIGS|5.0|The DVD arrived within a week of placing the order and it was in perfect condition.  This is one of John Mayer's best ... Thanks.
B001GH63IE|5.0|I am a Enigma fan. I've got to say that I pretty much liked the whole album. There are some of the songs that are my favorites and some are just ehh, ok . If you think about it when ever you buy a album from any artist there's going to be so many songs on that album that you really like and some that you wouldn't care to listen too. Enigma for me I can listen to the whole album and appreciate listening to it all without having to skip, or play something else. I have friends that bought this album and like it as well.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|The Butterfly Effect was a thrilling, dramatic and shocking movie. Evan's struggle to change his present and his past was depicted very well. And the culmination of that - in the Director's Cut (tragic) ending, at the very least - was perfect. I can honestly say that Butterfly Effect still remains to this day one of my favorite movies of all time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I got this DVD as an add on to my purchase as it was only $8.99 and I love the Biggest Loser! Anyway I do the Level 2 or 3 every morning in addition to my regular workouts.  It only takes 20 minutes and I actually do break a sweat.  I am a fitness instructor myself, so I teach classes and it's hard to find a workout that is tolerable on dvd.  I'm getting married this week and have dropped a few extra pounds.  This DVD is good for all fitness levels.
B001RTP48Q|4.0|I'm a bigger Erasure and Depeche Mode fan(own most of their cds) than PSB fan(own just a few of their cds), but i gotta say i wish Erasure still knew how to make good electronic pop songs like these.  Maybe i'm jaded with today's musical offerings but i really miss synth-pop music, or good electronic pop music in general, and these songs just hit the spot.  Overall, I really enjoyed this new release from the PSB, especially these tracks:<br /><br />3. Beautiful People(maybe my favorite, but way too early to tell)<br />4. Did You See Me Coming?<br />5. Vulnerable<br />6. More Than A Dream<br />7. Building A Wall<br />10. The Way It Used To Be<br /><br />These songs are just catchy, bouncy, and enjoyable to listen to.  The other 5 songs, and remixes on disc 2, i'll have to listen to more to see if they catch my ears more.  It's just that these 6 songs i latched on to immediately.  Honestly, I was looking forward more to the new DM release today(is this a great \\"80's\\" release week or what?), but i think the Boys just stole the Mode's thunder(for me anyways).  So for other casual fans peeking in, i recommend picking this up or at least give it a listen.<br /><br />(and while you're buying this cd, make sure you download the song \\"We're All Criminals Now\\" off the Love Etc maxi-single/EP.  It's another great pop song that should be headlining on this cd)
B000O5AYCA|5.0|This is an excellent album.  Beautiful, haunting lyrics combined with a melancholy voice make this CD one that you will listen to over and over and over again.  The closest thing I can compare it to is Bon Iver's For Emma, but much more polished.    I have suggested this album to a number of friends and each person comes back saying how much they love it.  A very solid album throughout, I highly recommend it.
1400067936|4.0|Fooled by Randomness delves into the often overlooked significance of chance in everyday life.  Taleb covers the issue of widespread innumeracy as well as society's general unwillingness to accept randomness as a major influence in success.  As Taleb suggests, \\"Past events will always look less random than they were\\", and as a result, the scope of the material covered within the book will be eye opening to most.<br /><br />Taleb infers early in the book that hindsight bias tends to cause people to create erroneous explanations for results.  \\"Nobody accepts randomness in his success, only his failure.\\"  Taleb points out that most people don't even understand adequate probability to recognize what is truly random and what is not.  Fooled by Randomness focuses on these issues and provides an abundance of intriguing concepts along the way.<br /><br />Taleb is careful not to discount skill, but weary of those who attribute any accomplishment with talent.  The ability to flip 10 heads in a row on a fair coin is pure chance, but only 1,024 people would be needed for an expectation of 1 success.  The successful flipper would have no more skill than any of the failures, yet society has the poor habit of assuming any success is a result of skill, discounting the near certainly of success given by probability.  Skill can lead to accomplishment in any endeavor, but given a large enough pool, chance will also lead to some success and thus to group all victors with an assumption of skill is irrational, and presents the essence of Taleb's work.<br /><br />The book is filled with many outstanding nuggets of insight and only weakened by its organization, as the material tends to be scattered at times.  This weakness is easily overshadowed by the value of the content and should not deter anyone with an open mind.  I highly recommend this book to those seeking a better understanding of chance and its role in life.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I'm dying to see the second season of this!  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it lasts more than two seasons. I'm not a big fan of vampires, with the exception of Interview With A Vampire and the Buffy movie, but this show has sunk its fangs into me. I love the setting and characters in the story, esp. Lafayette and Tara, they are simply hilarious. I love the accents of the characters with convincing Southern dialect, esp. the cajun dialect of the guy who turned out to be the...yeah, you know.     I've never heard of the books until I saw a featurette about True Blood on HBO, but from what other reveiwers are saying, you're either a fan of the books or a fan of the show.  I understand that the books outshine the film remakes (like with the whole Harry Potter and Twilight debate,Books vs. the movie), but this show is amazing and if it continues airing I can see it becoming as wildly popular as Sex in the City and The Sopranos.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|This movie as anything starring Kate Winslet was FABULOUS!  It was moving and emotionally stirring.  It is easy to see why she won the awards.  Be sure to watch *ALL* of the *Special Features*  on \\"The Reader\\" DVD, they explain so much.  I will not spoil it, but I do wish David Kross's character had come forward when it mattered.  Watch it, you will not be disappointed.   After all, I OWN it. :)
B00138JAI6|5.0|Essential. By which I mean, not just something that jazz fans ought to own, but that anyone with ears needs to have nearby at all times. Like almost nothing else in this world, except perhaps Coltrane and the late Beethoven quartets, this is art that both challenges and sustains, that mourns and celebrates, that is fiercely passionate and wildly exuberant, that from the dust and clay of human life reinvents the transcendent.    Plus you can dance to it.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|WOW what a powerhouse!  Meryl Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis, not to mention the young male actors.  This movie had me from the first word spoken.  Meryl was absolutely AMAZING!  I was dying to see what she did next.  Needless to say I now own this movie.  Just watch it, you'll see why. :)
B001IAOEXU|3.0|They do what they say they will. I might get a pair for a friend of mine. I took my controller over to his house and he said he liked them too
0694003611|5.0|I have the sweetest memories of my (now grown) children sitting in my lap as we read this at bedtime. They each enjoyed trying to spot the mouse and the items mentioned on each page.  Don't just softly read it to them but also let them interact with it by asking them, \\"Where's the mouse?\\", or \\"Where are the mittens?\\". This book is always included in my baby gifts to friends and family to get them off to a good start to a lifetime love of reading and to create sweet times together.
0385340990|4.0|I loved the book.....a very interesting time period with lots of great suspense.  Who would think you couldn't wait to read the next letter.  Good character development and the book is peopled with many quirky yet believable types.  The descriptions of the islands and various activities makes one want to go visit the modern  day Guernsey.<br />  The style is reminiscent of \\"64, Charing Cross Road\\", another lovely English novel about the war and its effects on ordinary people and the triumph of the human spirit over impossible obstacles.
B00006JLX4|4.0|Pavement was probably the \\"it' band in the indie rock underground in the 1990s. Not only did they set the groundwork for that scene as well as the slacker rock / lo-fi craze, they also made some damn good songs. Their first album was Slanted and Enchanted, a record that may be, more often than not, indie rock, but has a dazzling energy to it not unlike punk rock. This is especially true on the song \\"Two States,\\" in which they sound like the mighty post-punkers the Fall, complete with a truly good vocal impression of Mark E. Smith.     The album's pinnacle comes at songs four and five with \\"In the Mouth a Desert\\" and \\"Conduit for Sale!\\". The former is a catchy rocker with singer/guitarist Stephen Malkmus vocally smug (in the good way), augmented by bursts of feedback. \\"Conduit\\" is the opposite, and is a stellar example of Pavement at both their most experimental and hardest. The track features whirling guitars and Malkmus screaming the chorus, \\"I'm trying!\\" over and over, with ranty spoken word breaking up the swirl of infused instruments whipping around each other, like two goldfish in love swimming fish eyes and fish eyes locked onto one another while swimming around the outer rime of the fishbowl.     \\"Summer Babe (Winter Version)\\" and \\"Loretta's Scars\\" are stellar examples of the band in a poppy mode. However, it's not generic pop; rather, the songs have a genuine sense of melody that it earns, unlike many mainstream acts that just seem to force the hooks onto the listener with their ritzy production. \\"Perfume-V\\" is another rocker that sounds like a combination of both of these noisy and poppy types of Pavement molds.     The rest of the songs may not be as good, but whether it be the rising-to-stop-to-rise-again \\"Fame Throwa\\" and \\"No Life Singed Her,\\" to the blazing \\"Jackals, False Grails: The Lonesome Era,\\" and quieter songs like \\"Zurich Is Stained,\\" Slanted and Enchanted barely stumbles.     However, on the track \\"Here,\\" despite having Malkmus' crisp vocal work, the listener will want the hooks to emerge more pronounced, and the same can be said about the closing track, \\"Our Singer.\\" Despite the good singing, the subtlety on this last track is too obvious, as it has never been unusual for bands to put a soft song last and this song in particular really doesn't add much to Slanted and Enchanted; it defines it in the way that this record will often leave you mystified when it's about side-stepping the clichés with its fun attitude. When it doesn't, it may still be slanted away from being even average, but you will still want that ingenuity to shine through.     **** (Out of 5)
