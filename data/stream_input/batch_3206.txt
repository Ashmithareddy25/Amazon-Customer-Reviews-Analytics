B00CLD65X0|5.0|There's not much to say other than the third installment of this incredible, smart, visually stunning, and fascinating series continues to deliver!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to use, great option for getting rid of cable and more streaming options should be available soon.  I like it.
B00FVZJUS2|5.0|First off let me state that as of this review both the Amazon Instant Video HD version and the Amazon Instant Video BONUS HD Edition are the same price, link provided below.  Be sure to get the Bonus Edition if buying the HD version as it includes a number of the actors talking about the voices they played and their experience, in addition it also includes a Mini-movie at the end.  In total it is about 30 minutes longer for the same price.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00GP3NCYC Despicable Me HD Bonus Edition]]<br /><br />With all that said the movie itself is quite funny and a great one to watch, both of my kids throughly enjoyed the show and wanted to watch it again, however was a little late at night so that will have to wait for another time.  The addition of the girl agent was a very well thought out addition as it truly helped may the movie a 5 star rating. Buy the movie and enjoy.
B0097K21YW|2.0|There is one level that no matter how many times or how many people try it on my tablet we simply can't get past it.  Now I like a challenge but there comes a point where it just removes from the experience and this is it.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Addictive game.  Gives the brain a good work out.  Good variation on Solitare, less luck, more thinking.  Highly recommend. Get it, you won't be bored.
B0095G5AFU|2.0|This program started of nice but for a Pro version was just too lacking in options.  The biggest problem is scalability.  There shouldn't be a starting page amount to the notebooks you create, it should scale as you need it to.  I understand that it is likely a database with set limits or increments but that is no excuse for what should be a relatively easy implementation of seperate external documents linked together with in its data structure.  Too much work was put into the look of the app without much thought to what people would really like in it.<br /><br />This type of app would benefit greatly from a stylus style input.  To put it another way a keyboard that accepts quick handwriting.  The vanilla KB that comes with KitKat just feels clunky for taking notes.  This might seem unfair to judge this app because of the failing of the stock KB but this app is just a notebook so it is very much judged on how you take those notes down.<br /><br />I hope the devs take some time and make a stylized input and more logical notebook management for this otherwise visually beautifully designed app.
0316113514|5.0|When you go out for your daily run, you may think that you’re only helping to build strength and endurance primarily for your lungs, core, legs, and heart. Well in John J. Ratey’s novel Spark, an entirely new and exciting perspective on what exercise can do for you is introduced - it’s not only for the body, but also for the mind. John J. Ratey has an MD in psychiatry, works as a clinical professor at Harvard Medical School, and has written many other books similar to this subject in the field of psychology and neuroscience. He wrote this book to bring attention to the latest and exciting new research on exercise and the brain. Spark was written purely to motivate its reader to exercise or, in Ratey’s words, “stay moving.” Spark deserves 5 stars as it deeply illustrates in an easy to understand format how aerobic exercise is an exceptional way to keep your brain sharp and fully armed for your daily. After reading this book, my morning runs are now done for a completely different reason- to keep my brain in tune with my daily life.<br /><br />  As our bodies begin to move more than normal during aerobic exercise, we are also getting our heart rate up. As our heart rate builds, our body produces many neurogenic growth factors – most notably Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor, or BDNF. As stated so simply by Ratey in the text, BDNF is the “miracle-grow” for our brain cells. Dr. Ratey notes that when BDNF is sprinkled on neurons in the petri dish, those brain cells automatically start to branch out – curiously analogous to the effects of miracle grow on plants. This branching is the most important mechanism in learning and memory. As exercise lengthens, BDNF and other important factors build up in our body and go directly to our brain in stockpiles. As Ratey emphasizes repetitively, the subsequent build up of these factors serves to increase the strength of learning. They act as the tools and materials to induce more branches so that more connections are made a lot more readily. Now, absorbing and learning new information is a lot stronger and effective. From here Ratey makes a connection with our Stone Age Paleolithic ancestors who were notably the most active people in human history. In fight or flight activities that required much physical exertion, this process described above is what helped us to overcome recurring problems and dangers by learning from them and inventing better methods to avoid or engage in them more efficiently. At this point, Ratey has given such deep background as to why we possess such mechanisms in our brain during physical. This in itself really sets the stage of the book hereafter.<br /><br />  Ratey also introduces the idea of how important exercise is in balancing neurotransmitter release in our brain. The regulation of neurotransmitter release in our brain, including GABA, glutamate, serotonin, and dopamine, directly affects our mood and attention. These important neurotransmitters include GABA, glutamate, serotonin, and dopamine. Bringing the reader’s attention to numerous related research articles published within the last 20 years, Dr. Ratey demonstrates how well exercise regulates these neurotransmitter levels. The most spectacular research experiments to me were those in which three different groups of people were given different mood improving treatments. One group would be on mood or attention regulating drugs, the second group would be on consistent aerobic exercising regiments, and the third would be the control group. What was so striking was that the second group that regularly exercised, succumbed to the same effects of those who took the medications. Even more interesting, those who exercised also showed stronger and more effective improvements in the long term compared to those on just medication.<br />  This book is valuable for anyone who is looking to improve a mood disorder, mental sharpness, attention deficits, or who is just searching for more value in their daily exercise. It is a very motivating and easy read for those who aren’t familiar with neuroscience as it sufficiently describes the mechanisms that factor into the improvement of such prominent disorders we are so aware of in today’s fast moving world. Dr. Ratey backs up his claims with a multitude of published research studies which all come to the same conclusion: exercise builds, sharpens, and improves brain functioning. In the beginning of the book Dr. Ratey tells a story about a school in Illinois which changed its gym program so that instead of being judged on skill, the students were graded on physical exertion. This school then suddenly began to be ranked amongst the world with the highest science scores, and 8th highest math scores!<br />  I feel this book is just the start of a new idea for the world to consume: exercise improves your body, but most importantly your mind. I recommend the John J. Ratey’s Spark as it informs the reader about exercise and the brain in easy to approach language. This book was made for all audiences, not just the scientific, so try not to be overwhelmed by its premise. It will definitely motivate you to be more active since you will have a deeper understanding of the mind-strengthening potentials involved with being active.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Average movie for denzel, he can do better than that...hopefully we will get to enjoyed those great movies back then...
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is a great game I like it a lot u should get it definitely worth the money love it super fun
B005LAII94|3.0|Previous reviewers have already offered excellent summaries of the plot.  The project was well cast with an outstanding performance by Blake Lively.  John Travolta and Salma Hayek are superb in supporting roles.  The look of the film is captivating with highly-pigmented hues and good editing.  Some exposition and dramatic effect came through confrontational scenes that seemed too long to be realistic.  (Do the bad guys in that world spend a lot of time talking with their victims?)  Prospective viewers should be warned some images are extremely graphic but that is in keeping with the nature of the content.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Very colorful and fun game, yet the 99 cent pop up is distracting and a sure indicator nothing is free....
B006GKHE6G|5.0|There was a game like this one on n64 years ago called wave race loved playing that game as I do this one
B00571F26Y|5.0|I've been so frustrated lately and have always been wondering what I've been doing wrong with my diet. Ever since I've applied the new found knowledge from this book, everything has changed for the better. I also love that everything is backed up with legitimate research.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it it's fun and it is a time passer it's a fun game for kids and for adults how doesn't like minions
B0027BOL4G|3.0|It's interesting, but way way way overblown. The alternative to a little unpleasant way of industrial food production is a starvation. Period, verified through the history of humanity.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I like this game hut I need a few GOOD NEIGHBORS so please add me FAUDPAM I play every day all day long.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie was perfect. Just go in and do it your job and get out. no love story. no nonsense. it was perfect.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is amazing! But it takes ally of coins to evolve and so you have to play good and give time. Great game though!
B008LY9AWG|5.0|These short stories are all great! My only complaint is that they are so short. They are a nice deviation from the Harry Bosch books.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is great for people who like a little bit of a challenge and guess what my cousin popped a balloon at lowes shopping center
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Who isn't hooked on this series?  The characters are fascinating and the actors are perfect in their roles.  We can't wait for next season to see what happens to them.  We just got caught up in it--and are happy about it.  First Rate TV for a change!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Very satisfying ending to a series I've been reading for 20 years.  Brandon Sanderson neatly ties up all of Robert Jordan's notes without making things appear rushed or forced.  Like other reviewers, however, I am very sad about the loss of a certain non-human recurring character, and felt that there should have been a way to save them.  And I am sad that we're not going to get any more WOT stories, despite all of the character development that was not done on certain people in order to have things to work on, post-Last-Battle (Brandon Sanderson has confirmed that there were planned story arcs that will now not be written).<br /><br />But, all things aside, the WOT is now finished.  And I, for one, am very satisfied with its outcome.  Probably the most satisfying ending for a series since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was a great series!  Got involved in the characters' lives and watched several episodes in a row.  Can't wait for the 4th season premiere in January!
B00F3YHMUE|4.0|I've been a fan of Sting's work ever since The Dream of the Blue Turtles came out back in the 80's.  I was a Police fan before that, but I quickly recognized that this was a newer, different Sting, who was capable of reinventing himself.  This appears to be the case once again with this new album.  I bought this one after reading many reviews, mainly because of the links back to The Soul Cages (an album that I absolutely adore, especially after seeing him live while touring for that album), fully expecting that I might not like this new Sting anyway.<br /><br />And at first, I didn't like it, really.  Played it through a couple of times and thought, \\"Oh, well, that's $8 bucks down the drain.\\"  But there were a couple of songs that drew me in (Language of Birds and the Ballad of the Great Eastern, I believe, there are those Soul Cages links again), and I decided to give it one more listen.  And another.  And another.  And I have to say, it's growing on me. Even the Sea-Chanty type songs (Dead Man's Boots for one) have an underlying message and story that I find intriguing.<br /><br />Yes, the Geordie accent is a little odd, but he does a pretty good job of it (as far as I can tell; admittedly I've never been to Newcastle, so I don't know what the real thing sounds like) and it does sort of fit in with the theme of the songs, so after a few listens you sort of expect it and it doesn't seem so foreign.<br /><br />Those of you who are strictly fans of the earlier Sting will most likely not find much on this album to enjoy.  Those of you who loved The Soul Cages, especially the references to the sea, shipbuilding and cages, and enjoy a song as much for its story as its melody, should give this a go.  I'm glad I picked it up and am happy to see new music from Sting after all these years.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I adore this version and watch it regularly. It starts off slowly and the characters pull you in, while accurately following the original storyline. The acting is amazing.<br /><br />Thanks to all the reviews. I find them so helpful and well written.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I love the way the book started out.  I thought it would be a personal story of the young man and a painting and the people whose lives he touched through his adventures.  However, I did not like the brutality and the killing towards the end.  The premise of the story was good and for that I am glad I read the book.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I'd like to pause before starting the next 1000 pages, but I have to know what happens next.  Nice problem to have:).  Book 4 starts tonight.
B000FC0O7M|5.0|It's simply EXCELLENT!<br />It’s a real story, full of examples of how to do it right.<br />Don't miss it you will read it day and night!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Since discovering RM my sleep has never been more restful and I especially enjoy the &quot;layering&quot; effect you can create.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|We saw this when it was first released on DVD and enjoyed it. Of course, as fans of the Alien films we looked forward to this one. It isn't perfect, but overall, it is an interesting and intriguing film worthy to view at least once. In fact, we liked it so much that I just purchased a copy for home over the Thanksgiving holiday and watched it again. As a prequel, it does a nice job of answering some question, while also raising some new ones.<br />Overall, this is a good film.
1451627297|5.0|The characters were engaging, and the premise of time travel makes you start wondering &#34;what if'.  By the time it was over I was really sad to let the characters go.
6305212112|5.0|This is a great film about enduring friendships. It was truly well done. It makes you laugh, cry and think. There really isn't much else to say for it, except that if you enjoy tales of friendship that stirs all your emotions with a good story, then I highly recommend this to you without reservations.<br />Little did I know when I fist saw this one that I would ever be living down south near the state this movie takes place in. If you're a Southerner, by choice or birth, you'll really enjoy this film for its authenticity.<br />Overall, this is a terrific film and I bought it to watch over and over again.
0811870413|5.0|Makes you want to get some dough going.  I mean, really!  Look at that crust!  If only I had more time I'd be using this book much more.  Maybe good for my retirement in a few years!
B00G21XNKU|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Doctor going back to when it was only on PBS here in the states, Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker being my Doctors. The Day of the Doctor, in particular, honors the past while giving us a fun new adventure that opens up possibilities for the future,
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Fast read but does lack a stronger ending.  Predictable but does provide humor and entertainment.  Overall,  it is a Gillian Flynn story.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Thank you so much fir bringing kik back. Thank you thank you thank you thank you this is amazing :-)
B0015KO52S|5.0|One of the best albums I have in my collection. It is varied in tempo and style, has tremendous dynamic range, acoustic and electric, includes a ballad, which is not in fashion but highly original. Jack White never ceases to amaze me with his musical and creative gifts.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|.Great game for kids.  They learn hand eye coordination all while enjoying playing with animals.  I recommend this game for parents and grandparents to share with their little ones.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|they aren't shy about asking for your money , or for you to beg your friends to help you.  game play is fun, but limited.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|Great story. A story from a character voice not usually understood.  Funny, but also very real depiction of relationships between people.
B008JFURII|5.0|Five stars with a little less. Awesome movie, but it does slow down with some drama from time to time when compared to the first flic (its all about taste). Overall, it is a great movie!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Awe inspiring, emotional, etc. It's just... Amazing..<br />I love this book. I would recommend it to every<br />One I<br /><br />Kik
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Mickey is my kind of lawyer and this is a story that will keep you wanting to not put the book down--always inrersting
0689878451|5.0|This is an ADORABLE children's book about real life male penguins that chose to spend their days together.  The zoo keeper eventually gives the two an egg to raise after repeated attempts on the penguins' part to build a nest and incubate rock eggs.  The egg hatches, the girl chick is named 'Tango', and they're all one big happy family.<br /><br />The book doesn't have an 'agenda', and the PSA at the end is about penguins, not being gay.  It's a true story, well illustrated,  with the appropriate amount of words on each page to convey information without losing a child's attention.  Kids love penguins, and I couldn't think of a better book to teach about a loving family AND penguins than this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy I can now play this on my kindle....only problem is it is so addictive and I seem to never have enough lives lol
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I love this series.  It is even better watching the second time.  I see things that I missed the first time around.
0143038419|4.0|I loved this book and will be reading it again soon, as I found it well-written, interesting, and fulfilling. However, I've been reading some of the reviews on this site and it seems like some people are criticizing Gilbert's actions and thoughts rather than reviewing the book itself (by judging her for leaving her husband, etc. etc.) The thing is: no matter how detailed her descriptions are in the book, we never truly know everything that was going on in her life and how it actually was, or even who she really is as a person. Please leave your judgments out and just read the damn thing - or don't. What a woman chooses to do with her own life is her choice. If you do not believe in divorce or leaving one's husband to find happiness, then don't do it yourself! Damn. Some people seriously need to stop wasting time telling others what is right and wrong. Having said that, I do appreciate the critical reviews that say that it was predictable in some sections and not as interesting as they had expected, etc.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|GRAT ACTING,EXCELENT AUTHENTIC SCRIPT SETTINGS AND SETS ARE SUPERB MOREWORDS ARE REQUIRED BUT I THINK  RES IPSA LOQUITER WHAT MORE CAN BE SAID
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I'm only halfway through but already it is a classic. I'm sure there is a twist coming and I can hardly wait. I was trying to figure it out but I'm just gonna go with it and let it happen!
B0088WJDPK|5.0|We enjoy the Stargate franchise. We were sad when it ended. We are glad that it is available on Amazon.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Ms. Brosh's humour is contagious.  I laughed so hard when I read this book that I woke up my entire household.  Her illustrations perfectly compliment her wit, and I have started reading her blog as a result of this book.  Her writing style is brilliant.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great it is like subway suffers and there are many different minions to run with. Try the game now. It's fun to get bananas.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|OK this is an UPDATE to my earlier review. I upped the stars to 3 stars, because at least some of the issue is on our end.  I contacted our cable provider, to say I was having issues, and they must have upped the flow on our street, because now I can watch on this pretty reliably during the week, during the day. I still can't get it reliably at night or on weekends, when everyone else in the neighborhood is home and online, which is why I can't give it more stars.<br /><br />I can see that it is our cable flow that is partly at issue, but since I can watch Netflix without a hitch, anytime, that puts some of the fault at the device, as well.<br /><br />I don't pretend to know the nuances of why Roku works like a charm, but this doesn't, with the same signal strength, but I can't give it more stars than 3 as it stands. I do love being able to watch my shows at my convenience, on my big screen TV, but I have the luxury of being able to watch during the day, when others are at work. If you're getting this for night time viewing, know you may not be pleased with the result. My husband won't even consider it.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Original review:<br /><br />I soooo wanted this to work. I LOVE the idea of it, and the ease of it, but unfortunately, it just doesn't work very well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The unit came with everything I needed to hook it up, including the UPC plug and adapter to plug into a wall outlet, as well as an HDMI extender so if you can't fit it directly, this will give you some wiggle room. I was surprised, but I needed it because my TV curves just below the outlet, and wouldn't let the unit plug straight in. Good thinking on their part, and handy for me.<br /><br />Easy interface, and it walked me right through setup very easily.<br /><br />Easy to cast shows to the TV from the computer. Just get the show going on the computer, click the link, and it shows up on the TV a few seconds later. There is a slight delay, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I was easily able to cast shows onto the TV, unfortunately they'd  frequently stutter, and only play for a brief time (1 - 20 minutes) before they stalled completely, and lost the connection.  This despite the show playing perfectly on the computer I cast it off from.<br /><br />I didn't have any issue with the few seconds of lag time between the computer and the TV, but it can be annoying when the voices don't quite match up, which I found more often than not.<br /><br />Overall, great idea, and execution, but it sadly just doesn't work. I have Netflix and Roku for doing basically the same thing, but they work like a charm, so I don't believe it's an issue on our end.  We have a strong enough signal, and sufficient bandwidth, so this should work.re is a slight delay, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I was easily able to cast shows onto the TV, unfortunately they'd  frequently stutter, and only play for a brief time (1 - 20 minutes) before they stalled completely, and lost the connection.

B0097HSS4M|5.0|This app is very good when you need to quickly edit a photo. It has many great tools available to make any photo look professionally edited.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Typical Grisham plot; predictable. Still a quick, fun read. Used the Kindle version. If you enjoy Grisham, you like this. Not his most intriguing
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Read book in school and saw play with class. It was a good book, and I have seen the movie too
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book.. I loved it.. If you're a syfy lover, then I highly recommend this book, great story plot, and loved the characters...
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|The best game l have so far I love it because of multiplayer and knockout the cars are so awesome!!!!!!!
0670024856|5.0|WOW! Intensely brilliant! This was a fantastic journey with a unique collection of characters; thoroughly enjoyed every page! Also, I usually find endings tend to be weak, NOT SO with this novel. Strong writing throughout!
B00DERIV8Y|5.0|There is excellent detail on this figure.  Sure to be a collectible.  Hope there are more 10&#34; figures to come.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a pretty good book.  I haven't finished it yet but it has kept me interested.  I got it on sale so it was a good price.  I heard it's being made into a movie already so I wanted to read it first.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|It was all scratched up with the plastic already removed wasn't worth it. I went with a similar product by RINGKE FUSION
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoy this puzzle solver. The graphics are beautiful and the puzzles are just difficult enough to keep your attention without getting frustrated. I am looking forward to the release of the sequel through Amazon.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|The kindle app is not linked and update like the one on facebook. :( Guess I have to keep playing it on my android phone.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the fun and addictive game and play every day.  Just wish it had better way to share with fellow players instead of having to search your friend list which includes lots of non players.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I didn't think I'd like anyone better than Tenant, but Matt Smith kills it as the doctor. Gonna miss that guy, but I'm excited for the new guy too.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a fun game that is easy to learn and master.  When you get good at it, it can keep you busy for hours.
B007SGLZH6|5.0|I love this well written, very user friendly book! Ken Forkish did a great job of developing and recommending formulas that are easy and convenient to follow. The approach recommended in FLOUR WATER SALT YEAST is probably not what a commercial artisan baker would use but it's perfect for the occasional home baker who wants a wonderful result!
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|I love love this album. One of her best. Her voice is pure, soft, full of emotions. Crisp, clear. Out of 16 songs I could say that I'm in love with 13 of them. Makes u tear up, smile, get goose bumps. I listen to it overband over again while driving and she takes me to a different world. I think everyone should buy it. There're no more singers like her left out there.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|Brilliant, simple concept effectively realized. Does exactly what it claims, and the resultant &#34;full card&#34; of memory is so light, so small, that you'll hardly notice you're carrying it. The plastic is effectively shaped to hold the cards securely, without unnecessary bulk. If this holds what you need to store or carry, it is a real bargain.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Action packed and enjoyed the characters in that time. Hope they come out with more to view for my collection.
B00CWGLOY6|3.0|The reviews lead me to think that this would be an epic comic series which would beat all others. Instead, it barely kept my interest. I suppose it's a personal preference. I will say that the artwork is absolutely top-notch. I just think the story could be better.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Chris Hemsworth is awesome in this movie and sometimes funny. Will be looking forward to the others series coming out.
B004NROYVM|4.0|It is a nice and powerful flash, but not comparable to processional flashes like SB-910 etc. It does not have wireless capabilities and some other more sophisticated functions. As a basic unit, it is pretty good.
B003274QH6|3.0|not sure why everyone likes this show so much.  I have watched all but the final season --  Jessie is my favorite character.  He grows and deals with so much.  Walt -- I can't decide if he is bad or good but leaning towards bad.
B00GX59QO2|1.0|For an action movie with great action stars, this movie was just way too silly and unrealistic.  I am normally a big Bruce Willis fan but he sure blew it here.
B009LDD5E0|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like new cast members -- or the  originals in different areas -- but I still love the show.  the new members are great -- in fact I was disappointed sometimes when we had to switch to new york.  great show -- touches on so many topics -- I think this is great for all ages!
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Cinematography is amazing - costumes, acting, story - wow.  A bit racy, but no worse than the books (which I love).
B005K17RU0|1.0|Removed this app after two installs on Kindle Fire. Kept getting a popup message &quot;Network Connection Error&quot; for every screen display, yet the data was downloaded and displayed, along with ads.  Too bad, I like this app otherwise. Decided to stay with Weatherbug app.
1416575464|5.0|This is absolutely my favorite decorating book. It is beautiful to look through and filled with chic, stylish ideas. Definitely recommend if you are a fan of Domino magazine's esthetic.
B004QL7K70|1.0|I watched this on HBO and really didn't know it was supposed to be a comedy until i looked it up on here. It really didn't seem like a comedy when i watched it. It seemed like a serious version of one of the Jackass movies. You do see teenagers doing stuff and barely getting away until the end of the movie when the house burns down and neighborhood is probably getting ready to sue the host and his parents. In fact if any teenager did any of the jokes or acted like the ones in this movie they would end in juvenile detention or jail. I was sickened by the grocery scene where one of them gives a baby a shot bottle of liquor. I wonder how they shot that scene and did they do it legally.  Don't waste your time with this movie. It's pure crap.
B003BQZPK0|5.0|This tour is epic!! First and so far only time madonna has ever added a second leg to the tour. The remixes to the songs are fantastic!!!! It is non stop entertainment from start to finish. The costumes and lighting are beautiful !! I strongly recommend this!!
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Although an entirely different story line than the first season- many actors return and the story line is just as amazing. Jessica Lange is an incredible actress. You are drawn in to these complex characters and intrigued by how everything fits together. I can't wait for the third season- Coven,
B004MOMT2M|5.0|This DVD-A spends more time in my Acura TL's ELS system than any other disc I have. There's really not much surround sound going on but I can hear many things in the songs that I've never heard before. I love this disc and until one of the 5.1 masters goes in and really puts in the effort to remix this album properly, this is as good as it gets.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is historic fiction and the history is amazing and was totally new to me...a period in American history that I (and all of my very educated friends) never knew of. IN addition the story, the fiction part, was very moving and very well done. I couldn't put it down.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|... Whats not to love about Joss Whedon and his Firefly Series! Even when it comes on the SYFY channel on the odd month, we still sit down and re-watch a few. Lots of great adventures, characters and a good long useable storyline, with a good final conclusion. We would have kept watching it had it continued!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Very well done entertaining series. There's always an interesting plot in each episode. The actors are great with Julianna Margulies and Chris Noth. Two of my favorites.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|I love the recurring characters in each novel--they are like family.  However, too much backtracking about those relationships and repeat of each ones habits, personalities, past history and mistakes.  Let's move on and develop them a bit.  More action solving the crime instead of memories and minutiae about every part of their lives and more about the victim and the crime.  I guess I need a bit more action and new stuff instead of the same-old, same-old.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Not all the way through it yet for the second time. I'm enjoying it again. Wish they hadn't discontinued it!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is truly one of the best books I've ever read and is, without question, the only book that has caused me to weep.  The perspective of narration is incredibly well done and author makes it difficult to put this book down, even when your eyes are so heavy you fight to keep them open.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well written, excellently paced work. Good characters and clever plot line. I haven't reach the end of the story and hope it holds together as well as the rest of the plot has done so far. It is a hard book to put down because the author knows how to keep you engaged and on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. The style of alternating between the two main characters is well done.
B000X1Z0BU|1.0|This is an extraordinarily boring movie, and quite amateurish in feel. I watched the entire movie waiting for it to get better, but it was completely blah throughout. I found the fact that neither of the main characters' name was revealed (they are billed in the credits as, &#34;Guy&#34; and &#34;Girl&#34;) particularly irritating. That's 85 minute of my life I would like to have back.<br /><br />I did like the song &#34;Falling Slowly&#34;, but that's it.<br /><br />I think it might work better as a play, but I haven't seen the on-stage version. I certainly cannot recommend the movie.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I liked the beginning and ending of this book, but felt the middle got tedious.  This may have been the intention of author because that is the tedious part of Harold's journey and the point it began to spin out of his control.  Aside from that issue the book would have been 5 stars for me.
B004LGPBZI|5.0|Most people seem to be obsessed by Noel, Oasis and comparisons.<br />Sure you can hear it's definitely the same people.<br /><br />But mostly it's one' of the best rock albums i've had in years and it's all that matters.<br />While it brings nothing new in terms of style, all the songs are brilliant and have a more rock and roll edge than most people their age tend to lose.<br /><br />Unlike many people i didn't prefer Noel's album or &#34;be&#34; to this one.<br />They all sound pretty good to me for different reasons.<br /><br />What i like about this one is it's more garage souding, plug and play style.<br /><br />One thing is for sure though, the Gallagher Brothers put our better music now than in the last 10 years, which is really great and surprising, because let's face it, how many artists write some of their best songs late in their career ?
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This set was a gift and was received with delight. My family and I have watched every episode of every season. It's one of the best series ever created and makes a great gift for a fan of this show.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Like many people, i never really imagtined the Monkeys surviving their teen-age.<br />I thought they would break up, or get into drugs and release the same album over and over until people get tired of it.<br /><br />Well i'm surprised to see that not only they evolved, but they're grown artistically.<br />I was kinda puzzled by their previous 2 albums, because while i liked them i certainly had a hard time recognising the band and thought they were trying to souund like someone else, namely Queens of the stone age.<br /><br />But this albums in a way explains everything, and actually makes me like the previous albums better.<br />I now think all of their albums are great, just for different reasons.<br /><br />I remeber listening to the track &#34;riot van&#34; of the first album and think they should experiment more on that slow vibe.<br />And that's EXACLTY what they did. The last two albums allowed them to experiment with slower rythms and darker sounds. This album somehow seems to merge the quirkiness and sense of rythm of the first albums, with the slower, moody, dark sound and american influences of Humbug and Suck it.<br /><br />And the result is, to say the least, outstanding.<br />Sure it takes a few listens to get into it but once you do it's amazing how every single song on this album is just great, with no exception. And in terms of style, they achieved something incredibly rare : they managed to create something new, their new own sound.<br /><br />I can't think of many bands that managed to create something new the first time and do it again four albums later.<br />Thats, to say the least, impressive and goes to show how great this band is. It certainly deserves its notoriety and that's actually a masterclass on how things should ne done.<br /><br />The monkeys certainly shouldn't be taken lighlty, it's not the teenage sensation anymore, they just got their pass to the &#34;Greats&#34; club.<br /><br />Don't expect the monkeys to release another &#34;Whatever&#34;. enougth band release the same album over and over, good to one that can actually evolve and stay on top.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Wow, this was a different book! I have to say that I kept reading well into the night as I wanted to find out the what the heck was motivating this killer. The dialogue is stilted at times and the character development happened too quickly for my liking but it was a good read and a very unique take on a murder mystery.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|If you want a tear jerker this is it. It's about sickness and triumph, love and loss. Definitely a good read.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love the game but it is missing the option to add lives that friends give u. That button and also the spin wheel button. Please fix.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|My daughter downloaded this book so I thought I'd read it because I'm always looking for something to read. It is a really good book about the effects people have on eachother and how they treat one another. Definatley a must read for any teenager to read and any person really. It wouldn't be a bad book to put in the curriculum in schools.
B00FQMVCEA|5.0|My family loves to watch this movie.  If you like the movie, Cars, you will enjoy this movie.  Another great Disney movie.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I love the English humour.  The Actors work well together to make this a nice movie, the kind you can re-watch.
006202406X|4.0|My thoughts on Allegiant as I was reading through the book (oh, and by the way, I heard THE spoiler before I got to read it, grrr):<br /><br />The beginning was pretty boring. Talking, planning, some more talking, running - oh, look, someone died. Even once they got outside the fence I had to force myself to keep reading.<br /><br />THEN things started getting explained, and it was totally interesting and I was fascinated (I must be Erudite). I don't know if it's just me, but when Tris and Tobias realized the truth about their city it seemed to make the dystopian setting of this series a HUNDRED times more realistic - to me, at least - not seeming so much like a fantasy instead, like, say, The Hunger Games. I mean, I'M pretty sure a place called Panem will never exist, and the government will never make people fight in bloody televised Games. With the conclusion to the series, the Divergent Trilogy almost seemed like it could happen one day, and I know I was living in it while I was reading.<br /><br />So, the whole picture of this whole series was finally coming together, and the plot started coming together, and Tris and Tobias were having amazingly realistic, but heartbreaking, difficulties in their relationship, and there was action, and character revelations, and new serums (YES!! There goes my Erudite side again . . .) and then -<br /><br />Then.<br /><br />The ending.<br /><br />At first I was like, \\"This is stupid!\\" but mostly just, \\"WWWHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!\\" I was even crying a little.<br /><br />Once I calmed down, this was what I thought of the ending: It was realistic and I respect Veronica Roth for writing it. Obviously, my heart ached for the other characters, one person in PARTICULAR. (For those of you who haven't read the book yet, it should be pretty obvious that it's a character death.) And I settled with: I think the book is better with the ending the way it is. It wouldn't be as good another way. I think people are getting way too worked up over it. It was good. Great, even. And besides, it's done, so deal with it.<br /><br />Now, for the pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros: Tris isn't acting annoying and emotional like she was in Insurgent (I wanted to slap her SO hard then), the Fourtris is better than ever, there are new characters every bit as good as the old ones, the writing is great, the whole plot is explained, the action is intense, things are resolved, Tris has some amazing thoughts on important things in life, like courage and love . . . yeah. It has loads of good stuff. (After I finish with this review I'm going to go look up a bunch of Allegiant quotes and \\"like\\" them.)<br /><br />Cons: Like I said, the beginning was a bit slow, and obviously, the ending was a bummer but sort of had to be there, and I agree with the other reviews: Tobias's point of view was a bit too similar to Tris's. Oh, and what was up with Amar \\"liking\\" Tobias? Seriously? Did I totally read into that wrong or what? Nothing even came out of it!<br /><br />Warnings: Too many to write. Nothing extreme, but watch out for language, violence, and \\"young adult\\" romance (if you've read enough young adult books you'll know what I mean by that). I'd say it's 14+, and the theme is darker and more intense than the previous novels.<br /><br />Biggest pro: It's just an excellent novel. Read it, especially if you're a fan of either the first or second book.r it. It was good. Great, even.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game! I cuss like a sailor when I play it!! LOL very challenging but too fun to stop playing!
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Very interesting page turner with multiple plots and unpredictable~ I love the science and the complicated personal relationships between some of my favorite characters.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Matt Smith is a great Doctor and in his first season you get to see his growth as the Doctor. While not all the episodes are great, there are still quite a few good ones, The Eleventh Hour and Vincent and the Doctor to name two. This season works well as an introduction to Doctor Who as well.
0761172726|4.0|Have been using this particular calendar for years. Once I and my family got used to reading the layout it proved to be the best way to see what was going on in everyone's life - at a glance. I used the extra column for non-family birthdays and events or pet care info.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works as advertised. It turned my \\"dumb\\" HDTV into a smartie. Chromecast easily streams Youtube, Netfix, HuluPlus and HBO GO programs to my 3-year-old TV using my iPhone & iPad as controllers.
B007HO392S|3.0|How could one not like Carrie underwood. I purchased the cd for the car  but only like the first 3 songs
B00957T6X6|5.0|Can't wait for the sixth book... And to see how this is translated to screen. Twists at every turn. Well written.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it. Clarity and size off the candy help keep me focused. Much better than playing on my phone. Great free app.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This is, by far and away, the best headset I have ever used.  The basses are richer, the highs crisper, and the midranges completely natural.<br /><br />In addition, the ample padding makes them effectively noise-cancelling; so, Bose Quiet Comfort at a quarter the price.  A bit more cumbersome, yes, and for that savings, count me in.<br /><br />I've owned many headsets over the last forty years, and have used them in professional and personal settings.  These are simply my favorites.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|My son and I enjoyed the movie and the game is a great representation of the action.  Great game play; different levels keeps your interest; and free!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|not very nice to go 8 levels then asks for 99 cents to continue...not a free app, and would cost quite a bit to go the 400 levels it advertises! Now I will delete!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|You should get this game .I love it and you will love it  too .the best game  I ever  played
B00CATSONE|2.0|Very limited information on Nikola Tesla. Was looking for much more in-depth information on this mysterious and little talked about man that changed the world.
B001BANK32|4.0|Pretty much a typical Stephen King offering.  God forbid he should ever write a book with a happy ending, but that's probably part of the reason he has dedicated readers like me!. Guess we're as sick as he is.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|WWZ was a good read. It was a much better story than the movie showed, but I don't know how you could really make a two hour movie that followed the way this book is written. It actually takes place 20 years or so after the whole war on zombies took place. It is told from the perspective of a person given the task of interviewing survivors and recording their stories.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Just love it soo much.. been playing for an hour and its the EXACT thing needed. Love games from this developer.<br />i have a simillar game on my Xbox 360. NOW, I CAN PLAY WHEREVER I WANT!!<br /><br />works perfect on Galaxy S4.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for Free App of the Day
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank goodness it is working on kindle fire now. Love the game. Hate level 350. That's the only bad part being stuck sometime for several weeks. However
B009HUB40Y|5.0|So far, I like this game, although I think the colors. are dim compared to other gem 3 match games.  It makes it hard to see for me anyway, b but perhaps that's the plan.  I like the quickness and explosions are very<br />GRAPHIC.
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|David Baldacci scores again with King & Maxwell, former Secret Service agents turned PI's doing their collective best to win
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Eminem is still a lyrical genius. He's different than everybody else. He raps about more than just cars and money.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|would love it to have more apps or apps unique to this device (since I can get hulu, pandora and netflix on basically every device). but i certainly love the ability to stream web browser to the big screen. best price and simpler than competing devices
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's a great game...I haven't had any kind of problem at all..it does take a little time getting things to upgrade the storage...I even have my Boss playing. We both play on our Kindle Fire HD...
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Great graphics, love being able to choose different boats, and enjoy it any other way. Really love playing this games.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty shades all three books were all excellent and well worth reading you will enjoy. I am ready for the next fifty shades book I hope it's been written already.  Excellent read.
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|It's a must play if you're into adventure and builder games. Cute little monsters to destroy and a massive town to build
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Really impressive and clever technology in a small, inexpensive package. We've had ours for only a couple of days now, and it's improved the way we're using our TV. In particular, the kids can now share their favorite YouTube videos with the whole family instead of insisting we all huddle around their laptop or iPod.<br /><br />Setup was very easy.<br /><br />We also have a Tivo, which we use for (among other things) streaming Netflix. The Chromecast's video quality with Netflix isn't as good as the Tivo's, probably because the Tivo's Internet connection is wired, and the Chromecast is WiFi. Definitely not a deal killer for us.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Nice game. It keeps you entertained all the way through. Not very hard to complete missions or goals which makes it easier to stick around and play it. I gave it four stars only because its hard to get invest cards.
B009K916ZK|5.0|Perfect for connecting my monitor to my computer as well as my TV.  Works great with my MacBookPro and Acer monitor
B00GINENG0|5.0|By  over all I think it  pretty good!I like the  app... but it isn't as  good  as  the  other ones...
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Great movie. Only Joss Whedon can turn Shakespeare Whedonesque.  Cast is amazing. Amy Acker is perfect. Don't let the Shakespeare keep you from watching this gem.
006202406X|1.0|It wasn't the ending that made me hate it - that was a decision of the author. The book was a disappointment from beginning to end - bad writing, little story, no character differentials, took too long to get to market after the second book - this waiting for a year builds up too much expectation and leads to a let down for many. Six months is the way to go. The book was basically just a bunch of thoughts strung together and topped by a surprising and unnecessary ending for YA. There is always some editorial blame that should be borne when the latter books of the series are bad. Hopefully Ms Roth will write again... with the strength of the first book.
B004AM5QT4|3.0|This was a good book that held my interest. However, the best part was reading reviews at the end of other Ken Follett books. I am currently reading 'A Dangerous Fortune' and listening to 'Code to Zero' - both of which are very, very good. I think I'm hooked on Ken Follett!
1781162646|2.0|This book tried to be too many things and didn't do any of them well. It started out as an old man's look back at a strange event from his youth in the form of a ghost story. We learn the basic story behind the ghost early on and then wait over 100 pages in a book only 283 pages long for that story to advance. During that time I listened to the main character mourn a rather uninteresting girl who jilted him and teach me how to talk like a carney. None of this had anything to do with the ghost story I was waiting to explore.<br /><br />He does some heroic acts of the ordinary non-paranormal type that show he is a nice guy...but a 100 pages with no real plot advancement?? Then a friend comes to him with research related to the ghost. At the same time he befriends a very strange woman and her son. Her personality is not only unlikable but largely unbelievable. Another hundred pages go by spent with them and then the plot suddenly rushes to conclusion, leaving me completely out of the loop. The hero seems to know who the killer of the ghost girl is but his rational for knowing it is very weak in my opinion.<br /><br />King's best stories have maintained tension throughout . This continually drops the ball and I had to force myself to finish the novel.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Great short stories, each easy to read in one sitting.  Each chapter hard to put down in normal Grisham style.  Write another please!
B008VO3PA4|5.0|I had no idea my cat resembled a possible stereotype for being a cat until I read this book. Here I thought my cat was unique with all his quirks and nagging personality. How is it my cat acts a lot like the ones described in this book?  I got him when he was 8 weeks old and he's been like this for 15 years.  Who taught him all of these cat behaviors and how did they get in my home to train him?  I'm baffled.
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|A bit too immature and silly.  OK for watching on a train ride, but wouldn't spend an evening on it.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|Good cd but case was cracked when we received it! Music awesome though . Overall pleased besides the visit ion of the case
B00571F26Y|4.0|A very interesting book. In addition to being helpful with weight loss, the books explains what is wrong with gluten, why so people have trouble with gluten, and what to do about it. Very informative.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I'm not one to rate every app I purchase - only for the very worst or the very best do I voice my opinion. This game falls into the latter category. I ran two races on my phone (HTC DNA) and I'm in love. The graphics are great, the music rocks, and the controls are surprisingly easy to handle, even for me, who has never mastered the steering on any video game, ever. I haven't even explored all the features yet, and I've already decided this one's a keeper. I'd gladly pay for this game, and as FAOTD today, it's a deal of a lifetime. Seriously. I can't wait to download and play this on my Kindle Fire.
1451666179|5.0|This book was great. Simple, but profound at the same time. The drawings are just killer and almost tell the story without the words. Very funny!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is full of surprises at every corner! It is full of adventures-- plus you get to play with your favorite minions!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It was like all Stephen king books. Good beginning , very slow middle, and good ending. I still love reading his books.
B000IZA9PI|4.0|One of my favorite Star Trek movies. It's wonderful to see a younger Tom Hardy do a magnificent job in his role.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|Can't print from web site after you google it. You have to go to the e-print site and type in the url. I print off the cuff, sometimes I forget the url. Should be page on screen, then one icon pressed, then one button PRINT. Does not happen. Size is different after you do print. Done
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read it at the advice of a niece...wasn't sure I would like it since it seemed like a kids book.  I couldn't put it down.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Pendergast at the top of his game. Always look forward to these books, and they have yet to dissapoint. BRAVO!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I haven't played solitaire in years.  It is a time-filler and fairly easy to do.  No brainer but I like how you can compete with your own scores.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|great product!  works well with my old 55&#34; toshiba lcd tv, which i almost threw out because it wasn't smart-enough!  lol.  requires the power adapter for use, but is not a big deal.  i control the device with my android phone, my roommate switches shows with his iphone app, lots of fun, compatible with both devices.  no buffer issues at ALL with youtube or netflix.  webpage streaming works, ok, with laptop, but better with chrome app for android phone.  streaming webpages with video content a bit slow buffering on laptop.  slow buffer issues playing my content from pc and streaming to chromecast, an A/C router might solve my problem...  all we need now is vudu app control -google!  or make every app chromecast-able?  worth every penny for people with less-than-smart tv's, a must have! (interesting note, chromecast seems to be always running, even when tv is off, maybe downloading updates, idk?  but draws probably the same power as plugging in a cellphone, so not a big deal.)  more than totally satisfied for the last two months!!!
0307592731|5.0|I have passed this book on to my friends and noone is disappointed.  It held my interest. I recommend it.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I have really enjoyed this CD. I am in my car driving 7-8 hours a day and I have learned I HAVE to listen to it at least 1-3 times a day. I am sure I have either scared or entertained other drivers because when I like my music I really get into it, including hand movements. Even when I'm not listening to it I am playing/hearing it in my head. I will be checking out The Piano Guys other CD's. Thanks
B00DNB9RXO|3.0|another maze game with the added twist of making it respond to the position of your device<br />rotating you device to make the avitart move is the only cool thing about it.
B00GIGGS6A|2.0|Packagin is minimal. No cd driver inside! Pricing is ok. Look is good. Express keys are clumsy, and sometimes get STUCK (but it's not a major proble):<br />Once downloaded from internet... and installed...<br />On windows create a backup of your system status... or YOU'LL have troubles after!<br />Driver (generic bad Engrish ones btw... IE is &#34;por&#34; and not &#34;PRO&#34;... have a laugh!) are awful, bugs with lots of troubles with 3 different pc (Main pc, backup, and notebook). Bugged experience. BTW the pressure level are &#34;bad&#34;, I mean, you have to PUSH harder and harder, so you have something like 1-2-3% then 90-100%. So it's ok a very very very cheap tablet, but don't expect too much. Not really suggested unless you have to spend few coin on a second rate tablet. Not happy... It's certainly NOT PROFESSIONAL but just cheap backup, for no serious work...<br />Even a Wacom Bamboo (cheapest but last generation) is more professional than this... I have here 1 bamboo (newest one) and 1 intuos3 (old old)...BOTH are better! So, beware of the purchase... Cheap is cheap you know it, you get it!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Life in the pages, more so, at times, than asked for.  But there, nevertheless.  As are you, and I, somehow in this together.
B001IF252M|4.0|A convenient and useful gadget.<br />Pros:<br />1. It is so easy to access. I just hook it up to my iPad mini and it instanly brings up the camera section of the Photo app. you can see all the picutures in thumbnails. transfer my photos to my iPad.<br />2. Small footprint: I used to bring laptops on vacation to transfer the photos nut now I just take this tiny adapter. Very convenient.<br />3. You can delete photos off the card.  When you select the photos, you can either download or delete. It  is easier than deleting pictures than using the camera.<br />Cons:<br />1. I cannot open the picture before I download it to my iPad. Sometimes, I take a bunch of the same shot so i just want to one.<br />2. The photo selection process is difficult. You have to click on each individual one to select it. It takes a while if you have a lot of pictures to transfer.<br />3. It does not work with my iPhone 5s.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This game is a great deal of fun.  It's very fast paced and it definitely keeps you on your toes!!  I don't have a great deal of patience so after dying in some of the screens so quickly I allowed frustration to take over and chose not to play the damn game anymore! LOL...<br /><br />This game is very unique and most of the quick scenarios are very unexpected.. if you are great at thinking fast on your feet and enjoy fast paced unexpected gaming.. you will enjoy this App!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Very well done. Challenging but not overly difficult. Crystal clear graphics. Very user friendly. Hasn't crashed once. There is one draw back....there is no exit button!
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Had a movie party this past weekend, 8 people came to watch this on my 10' screen. Just like being in the sub. maybe I should have dripped water on their heads too. But the image and sound it felt like real depth charges were hitting all around us. Great movie.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Thumb up! Thumb up! Thumb up! This movie is the best than any superman movies.  Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Thumb up!
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Like this game but unless you want to spend real money once you're out of tokens you don't play. I refuse to use my hard earned money
B003EYVXSW|1.0|This movie is stupid, stupid, stupid, and stupid.  This movie repeats to say G-dd*mn and Holysh** too much.  Do not waste your time.  Do not buy it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was a challenge to keep up with the web of stories, but Hosseini is a master at character development.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|Great game! The graphics are excellent. The story line is good. The hidden object games are super. Keep up the good work. Looking forward toward the sequel.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Very nice game to while away the time with. Very interactive and experience builds quickly. Great colors, fun quests. Patience is the key.
B00G21XNKU|1.0|I love Doctor Who but the jacked up prices for this special have kept me from seeing anything but the minimum. Sorry Amazon but rather than deal with the price gouging I'll figure something else out.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Well made! Charges the iPad, iPhone 5 and 3g without issue. The first (car) iPad charger that works for me.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Sharpened all of my knives the day it arrived.  This is compact but it works.  I still have to sharpen my 1 serrated knife but I'm expecting this little sharpener to be great for that as well.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|I love the way they add a new sound to Classic Christmas music. It's so refreshing that it makes me want to listen to carols again!
B0009P42S2|5.0|We originally bought this for my son, and enjoyed it so much that I bought another copy for us.  We first watched it in Japanese with English subtitles because we didn't notice that it could be played in English!!  Duh!!!!
B00004VVND|5.0|I liked very much this films when I saw it many years ago and I realize now that it remains as good as I remembered.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|I am so glad the price came down on this item.  I love the series.  My daughter got me hooked on it!!  If you like twists and turns, this series is for you.
B0018OFN1S|4.0|I have only seen this Fast movie when it first came out in theaters & the second one I just finished (did not enjoy that one).  I really enjoyed this one & thought all of the actors meshed well together.  I will not watch Tokyo Drift (it doesn't have Paul in it) & I hope 4, 5, & 6 are just as good as this one.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Red2 I thought it was ok and I enjoyed. However, it seems to be getting a little silly. Please no Red3.
B0018OFN2W|2.0|I had only seen the first Fast movie, so I thought I would watch the others.  After watching this one, I was disappointed.  As nice as it was to See Paul Walker, the plot was horrible.  I plan on watching the others (except Tokyo Drift) & I hope they are not as bad as this one.  Tyrese was okay & I hope his acting improves in the other movies.
B009Z1R2HY|5.0|A great record. RLJ at her best! The album was on time and in perfect condition. I would suggest any fan of RLJ to make sure this is in your collection.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book was unsetlling in many ways, and even though the fate of the main characters is revealed by the narrator, I still found the story gripping and gritty. A grim reminder of Germany's sordid past, and a tribute to the human spirit.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book was well written, it kept me reading. It was very interesting,the characters were very interesting. It was a mystery and a love story all in one,plus an interesting story about corrupt business practices.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The beauty of life and ugliness  of life is revealed in this story of Germany during WWII from a Germans daily life.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|It's fun so far. It is a lot like mario bros. If you o like that style this is a good game tho I wish they showed you a map of the world's you are playing. It would add to the experience.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Purchased at $55 and the sticker on the bottom shows retail is $35. Very tiny I expected something larger for that price.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I love Columbo and this was a perfect way and time to get the whole series.  On a cold rainy day I can just have my own private marathon!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game forces one to think  outside of the box. fun yet challenging at the same time, really have to use your brainpower for this one
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|The choreography in this film is beautiful.  The little girl is wonderful.  All the characters are good.  Nice family film.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keeps your mind going!!been playing this for hours and didn't even know it. Can't put it down! Can't wait for the new ones!!
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|This movie is still awesome even today. It has Sci-Fi, action, a love story & a morality check all in one!
0316322407|5.0|I find it so gratifying that the depraved Taliban scheme to rid the world of<br />this very &#34;dangerous&#34; girl  who dared to want to be educated, not only<br />failed to eliminate her but turned her into a world wide celebrity. Serves<br />them right!
B0010X73ZG|4.0|This Stephen King story is unveiled with good character interaction and creepy special effects.  Much like his other stories, though, expect a twinge of sadness.
0743270754|4.0|It is easy to understand why this book was widely read and adapted into a film. It reads more like a novel and the characters are such a fascinating bunch. I don't use an electronic reader so my only issue was the physical weight of the book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|VERY INTENSE GAME.  MAY FRUSTRATE YOU AT TIMES,  BUT ITS HARD TO STOP PLAYING.  ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED.
B008K8U13K|5.0|This game is really cool. It has better graphics on the Wii ,ps3,and Xbox. But other than that, it's great
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent Book, another hit for John Grisham. A page turner, couldn't put it down. Delightfully interesting characters and a face paced story of excitement and suspicion.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|An excellent photo exhibit of the wonderful diversity of NYC.  An interesting collection with many surprises.  This would make a great holiday gift.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Terrific!! This story was very well written and had the perfect twisting plot to keep me on the edge of my seat. Best of all, the story was solid from beginning to end with an unpredictable climax and conclusion.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Sometmes I want to watch purely entertaining movies and forget about the reality.  This is a perfect movie for that kind of occasion.  Exciting and Stylish.  On the weekend of hectic work with much stress, I put this into my DVD player with a glass of wine or a bottle of bear.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is exactly what you are looking for if you want to view online content on your TV without any cables.<br />Depending on distance between your computer and your TV, it is probably even cheaper than a HDMI cable.<br />Perfect solution!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It's a great sharpener, but is to small to sharpen some of the bigger hunting or combat style knives or axes
B00004XMTJ|1.0|Sent the first one with no DVD even in the box. Was given the run around and false promises from amazon customer service and someone who said they were a manager out of England. Was put on hold several time because they did not want to here my complaint. One time was put on hold but could still here the manager she and the customer service rep were laughing at my situation. When she got back on the phone with me she denied it when both my wife and I heard them because I put the phone on speaker. The next day there was no emails with the promises they made to me to make it right. This has caused me to not do anymore business with amazon.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I play it on my phone and kindle. wish I had more lives to play longer but it's also good to take breaks :)
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I am very impressed with how simple this is to use!  I'm learning  Italian with my boyfriend and we both are picking up the language easily.  It helps immensely that you learn th  written ans spoken at the same time...great program!  I love it!
B00CH3DBNQ|1.0|I chose this rating because the writer used extensive detail about family relationships.  I like good character development  and explaining relationships, but found the book dragged because of these details overrode the point of the book.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Really awesome game cool graphics nice gameplay but needs more upgrades overall 5/5 though 10/10 if you add more upgrades
0920668364|5.0|My all time favorite Robert Munsch book. This is a book that you can read for years and will grow with you same as the little boy and his mother in the book. My two year old loves it and sings along when I read, I love you forever, I like you for always, as long as I am living... my baby you'll be.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|The crew of this mission is trained to reignite a dying sun with some sort of mega bomb in order to save mankind. No mention is ever made of all the other species on Earth, but hey, who cares about them. We learn that the first mission mysteriously failed and all contact with it was lost.<br /><br />As the new crew reaches the sun, they find the spacecraft from the first mission. No contact is made so they have no idea if there are survivors but for some reason, they believe that their bomb must still be intact. So a decision is made that two bombs are better than one, just in case this new bomb fails.<br /><br />Based on the well thought out premise that two bombs are better than one, this crew decides to risk their bomb, their ship, their lives, the mission to save humanity, for the outside chance that they may be able to obtain the first bomb, gain control of the first bomb, recalculate, on the fly, all the intricate maneuvers necessary to send both bombs into the sun, and complete the mission successfully.<br /><br />There is absolutely no sign that anybody had been prepared for the possibility of coming across the first mission. Astronauts are usually trained for all possible contingencies, and finding the first mission would certainly have been one of them. And you can believe that their training would have drilled into them, that under no circumstances were they to divert their mission in any way. Not even for the intricate physics theory of, &#34;two bombs are better than one&#34;!<br /><br />And there is absolutely no sign that anybody on this crew has an ounce of intelligence, having agreed to this lame theory without thinking, that just by diverting their mission they were risking the existence of mankind, and oh, all those other pesky critters.<br /><br />Needless to say, one of these &#34;geniuses&#34; goes off alone to calculate a major maneuver that will get this new improvised mission off to a good start. So, does he go over his calculations with a fine-toothed comb and then go over them with the rest of the crew before he hits the enter button? I mean, if two bombs are better than one, certainly two, or more, heads are better than one. But NO! He hits the enter button immediately after making his calculations and as a result, the ship is practically destroyed.<br /><br />And so the captain and another crew member must perform a risky spacewalk to make repairs. Did I say the captain performed a risky spacewalk to make repairs? Yes, the freakin' captain. And guess what folks. SPOILER...the captain dies! You would think, this would be a good time to abort the improvised &#34;two bombs are better than one&#34; plan and run, don't walk, to the Sun with the bomb you already have. But that would be asking too much of the morons on this crew. From here on out, it's one bad decision after another, one disaster after another.<br /><br />I get that if the crew hadn't decided to try to get the other bomb, there wouldn't have been a movie (which wouldn't have been so bad). But for the screenwriter to get these supposedly brilliant people into such dire circumstances because of their stupid decisions, made this viewer not want to invest one ounce of sympathy for these idiots. There could have been a dozen plausible scenarios written to make them HAVE to try to get the other bomb. All I can attribute the decision to make the motivation, &#34;two bombs are better than one&#34;, is lazy writing and lazy directing.<br /><br />Having these supposedly very intelligent people make such a stupid, asinine decision made it absolutely impossible for me to suspend my disbelief after the first 20 minutes, which made it impossible for me to watch the remaining 90 minutes. I did skim through it though just to find out how much more ridiculous things got. And boy, did things get ridiculous. SPOILER....In the last 30 minutes, I thought I had fast forwarded into another movie. What the hell was Freddy Kreuger doing in this movie?!<br /><br />This movie was an absolute insult to my intelligence. The fact that it has gotten so many positive reviews, once again proves to me that most people are completely ignorant as to what science fiction is supposed to be. There's a reason the word &#34;science&#34; is there. When a script throws all sense and logic out the window, you leave the world of science, and enter the realm of fantasy. I'm a huge fan of both sci-fi, and fantasy films. The problem is, Sunshine is a horrible science fiction film, and an even worse fantasy film. Which leads me to a very cynical conclusion as to why the movie has received so many positive reviews. It's the same reason that we'll never be visited by aliens from another planet in search of other intelligent beings.positive reviews, once again proves to me that most people are completely ignorant as to what science fiction is supposed to be.

B005721W9O|5.0|Best movie ever. I absolutely love it. The cast is star strung. And the humor is unmatched. Who doesn't like Tim Allen?
B00DZFM9WY|5.0|dream theathers matchless style comes out on vinyl for the first time you will love it!! very limited is this format recommend you hurry and get you a copy
B00A2H9OSK|5.0|nothing pleases me more than to see Vin in an action movie plus to look into those eyes ...Wow!!! and his role as Riddick this movie is freaking Awesome as me and my Nephew are big Fans Keep up the great work Vin ..u r hot!
B008UX2UIO|5.0|This book grabed me in the first few pages. It is is funny while it makes you think . Shame the arthor is no longer with us.
B00CO5AQ12|4.0|got it for the kiddo and ended up playing with it my self! fun toy thats not to messy and everyone i show it to is amazed. a little expensive if ya ask me but it is pretty cool
B00051E906|5.0|Normally on the ground it is below 0.16 micro serviets. I am now on plane from NYC to Orlando and it was over 3.xx. When I turned it on I didn't know what was going on because it was beeping like crazy. But then I realized I was being cooked in the air.<br /><br />I just got back from my trip, and was able to observe a little better on the return flight. At cruising altitude at one point the meter read 3.51 µSvh-1. I'm no expert but from this website [...] 3.51 µSvh-1 is deemed at elevated risk.
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|Yes, on the raunchy side which does not usually appeal to me, but WAY too funny to be offended. Saw it three times at the theatre and am about to buy it now. Best comedy ever!
B000FC1HBY|2.0|I expected a better series, the plot is slow, it is filled with descriptions that only extend the book without purpose. There is no closure of events in either of the two first books, the author extended the series to make you buy the next book. I'm not!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Wish it wouldn't lock you out to pay to play longer. Otherwise, fun game. Challenging but easy enough to win.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|A must own if you have a console version of this game. Great fun! I've spent countless hours enjoying this.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|Not impressed. I guess I outgrew King.<br />The Shining should stand on its own.<br />Best King book for me is the Stand.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|My best friend and I really enjoy Susan Boyle.  We have every CD she has produced.  I listen to this CD in the morning, before going to work, during this holiday season.  This CD is my favorite Christmas CD with Susan.  Of course, I say that every Christmas about her latest.
B005MLOKXA|3.0|I started with season 1 and was enjoying it very much. Season 2 started out OK  and then it began to get into politics, corporate doings; etc.; I lost interest. The show is well written, well acted; I like good court- room drama. They can leave out the betrayal, etc.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I adore puzzles. To say this is a great game does not come even come close to describing this amazing game. I have been playing games all my life (60 yrs) but this game is in a category all by itself. Please make another!!!
B00FPH3YQA|4.0|Not as good as the first (would be very hard to beat that), but in my opinion much better than the second one. For a movie that never needed to happen, I actually really enjoyed this. So if you were torn about renting it - I say go for it. If you loved the first, and thought the second was okay - I am sure you will like this one.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|An interesting approach to finding a marriage partner to say the least. The characters were real and quirky and the story flowed nicely.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I would recommend it to intelligent people  it was fantastic  perfect writing. I could read it again and again. It will make a good gift.
1451666179|5.0|If you've never heard of Hyperbole and a Half, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU???<br /><br />No, seriously. Have you been hiding under a rock? Allie Brosh is a literary GENIUS and highly skilled artist (and by &#34;highly skilled&#34; I mean she draws the most absurdly hilarious illustrations to go along with her stories). Highly skilled, people.<br /><br />Do you want to laugh? Do you want to cry (from laughter)? Do you want to crap your pants? Then you NEED Hyperbole and a Half. (The crapping of your pants is optional)
0062107313|4.0|It keeps me interested enough that even when I wake up at night I pick the book up and read!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love this app!!! I am learning and at my own speed. I recommend this for anyone who wants to learn or brush up on their Spanish.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Since kik is back on now new updates have been installed it is so much better! and so much faster now! I can say bye bye to the waiting on your login screen... Cause on the kindle kik hasn't been on the app store for a while.
B00F6NKFQK|4.0|I was gifted a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I found this to be well written and engagingly funny.  I would recommend this to others who wanted a light hearted read.  This is my first book by this author and when I need a break from the shifter romances I am addicted to I will happily read this book again.
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|My kids love it. Easy to use. My kids assess 4 &  7. Great interaction and noise for them. Fun
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son is an avid gamer, and Minecraft is one game that he has wanted to get but hadn't.  He was very excited when I found this pocket edition for the Kindle HDX!  He LOVES it!!
0061906220|5.0|My kindergartners love Pete!  His message is always positive. As a teacher, I appreciate the free audio download.  I always look forward to Pete's new adventures.
B00BDAP66E|3.0|I haven't had an opportunity to play with this app very much, but feel it would be a benefit to manage our Facebook pages more closely.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|It won't even load for me. It has to download, it takes forever. You have to stay on the internet for it to download I guess.  DON'T GET IT!!!!!! :=(
B009C7JS14|5.0|Weather radios do not work in the area of the state I live in--too far from things.  This app will allow me to check weather conditions, be informed of weather watches and warnings, etc.  Also great when traveling to check weather conditions at your destination.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It doesn't work on kindle just says try again in a bit I tried again later and still doesn't work this app sucks on kindle please fix it used to work before but now it doesn't help!!!
B008YU0AOE|4.0|This calculator application is OUTSTANDING!  Clear, large function buttons make it easy to see and to use.  A great item!
B00FATEJYE|2.0|I've played this game on I pad and it was pretty fun. So I thought about it and I thought maybe they have  it on kindle so I checked and they did. But I want to know why it takes so long to download I downloaded it about a half an hour ago and its still on 40 percent while other apps download in less than two minutes.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Excellent app!  Large, clear display of day and time, and the ability to set your alarm sound is an added benefit.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this app because it uses the full kindle fire screen. The numbers are large enough that you don't have to be worry about touching the wrong key. It's good for doing basic math and all of your actions show up on the screen. Great app!!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can check my Facebook account faster on the Kindle HDX than I can on my desktop or laptop computer!
B0085BNIXM|5.0|Great baseball movie. Well acted by all involved. Seems to be a timeless movie that is appropriate or applied to any year.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I recommend this book to every one.  It is captivating and truly amazing from the first page to last. Sincerely
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I just needed something simple. This calculator works just well for me and my kids. Thank you. For me it's was free and that's what count to me.
1609611543|5.0|I am loving this book.  My husband and I have stopped eating wheat and most sugars and we have both lost weight.  I dropped about 3 lbs in the first week.  My husband is cheating so his weight loss is less.  I have tried many of the recipes in the back and ordered the cookbook from Amazon a few days ago.  We are feeling good about these changes because we are eating more healthfully.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Ever since I got this game my kids came back my wife loves me again and I got a raise
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. If I could just figure out how to defeat Vector battle I'd be happy happy happy! It's very addictive and free. For sure a favorite of mine.
1742204120|5.0|Lonely planet's India guide book [[ASIN:1742204120 Lonely Planet India (Country Guide)]] is superb.  It presents information organized by region, by month, and by interest.  The maps are clear and there are enough of them to be useful.  There are not too many photographs cluttering the page.  The city descriptions provide information about places to see, where to eat, and where to sleep with additional information about transportation and activities.  The reviews/descriptions of each restaurant, hotel, or site are interesting, informative, and sometimes eccentric.  In short, this is everything you need in a tour book if you are actually travelling and everything you want in a tour book if you are an armchair traveler.<br /><br />Perhaps the only problem with this book is its size; 1200 pages and two pounds!
0553582011|3.0|400 pages in and still waiting for the story to pick up. Martin seems to have padded this book by adding a multitude of character names to almost ever page. How many will be remembered when (and if) they ever play a meaningful role
B00984668E|5.0|This great music to listen to while you're in the shower.  Or out of the shower.  Either way, it will wake you up and get your blood flowing (as in \\"circulating healthily,\\" not as in \\"hemorrhaging\\").  The live bonus tracks recorded at Stubb's BBQ in Austin are a great addition, but I get hungry knowing where they were playing.  Excellent musicianship, creativity, and recording quality.  Memorable riffs and lyrics that will keep your interest and stimulate your imagination.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Finally, this is like getting a brand new Rush album. I loved this when it first came out but I was always trying to adjust my equalizer, and now it is way better than any of the adjustments I had come up with. Great songs, great band, and now great sound.
B00GX59QO2|3.0|Ok follow up to Red-should have outperformed with cast and baseline, unfortunately did not. Watched on Amazon so not a big loss...
B00C3MKCIS|4.0|Good stuff, just so bummed they had visa issues (ticket sales issus) prior to the show I was supposed to see them at in NYC. Great music though and any fan of prog rock should pick up this disc, forget the fact that it is phil collins son, who cares. The music speaks for itself as does his drum playing and his singing is not bad either.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|READ THIS BOOK!  I have depression issues and this book made me realize I have something to live for. I cried at every word and me and my friends love this book. I recommend it to everyone no matter what. The sequels good too but this book is unbeatable. This book reminds you of how no matter how great your life is or isn't there is always a reason to live. Absolutely uplifting. Make sure there's tissues around.  I can't tell you how amazing If I Stay is.  3 thumbs up ;)
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Fun variation of Tetris but the shifting colors can be distracting.  Maybe it would be better if they had an option for changing colors or have it be static.
B0061S0A64|5.0|My boys love playing this app., they love desiging the music..we even made sleeping music.My boys are 4 and 7
B00F91RYL8|5.0|What can you say about Brad Pitt? The movie was very very good. I would recommend it to anyone and I will see it again And you can't beat the rental price,
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a entertaining game and provides hours of enjoyment.  If you like challenging solitaire you will like this one.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|never saw the movie. it did not play . bad deal problem with prime over and over again. really you would think it would have been corrected.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I belong to face book anyway so it will do even though I don't go on face book too much.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|Awesome game son it is off the chainz and if you don't like it you suck at life at everything
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I don't really like it.  It doesn't seem like too much fun but I will play it once in a while.
B00E95ED32|4.0|Wake me up (obviously), Dear Boy and Hey Brother were awesome! However, be warned - this album is quite 'experimental', although Avicii might state that he is staying true to his music tastes, those music tastes are NOT what you'd expect if you're conditioned to the sounds of 'Levels', 'Silhouettes', 'I Could Be the One', 'Fade into Darkness' and other big room melodic house tracks. I'd recommend that would-be purchasers youtube a few of the songs on this list to get a feel of what the music sounds like:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />E.g. Liar Liar, Heart Upon My Sleeve, Lay Me Down.
B0081SRJSY|3.0|I like this game. However, as someone who has never played it before, I found the tutorial to lack some key information. There is no detail on how the game is scored, or when the game is over. Also, there is no undo button. Once you've placed a tile, you cannot remove it. I got this as the FAOTD a few days ago, and while it's interesting, I wouldn't pay $4.99 for it...maybe .99 or 1.99, but that's it. On the plus side, there are no unusual permissions or annoying ads.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Loved it, a great mix of humor and heartwarming scenes.  I wish I had watched this one before Despicable Me 2, but they were both great.
B0067R0APK|3.0|I thought I could use this in place of my local tv weather program but I miss the radar images.  There is too much on national news.
B00FVZJUS2|5.0|This movie  is hysterical.  Just as funny for adults and kids alike.  I'm not big on animated, cartoon type movies but this one kept my interest.  I will watch it again........Love those Minions.
B005LJK3AC|3.0|Ridiculous beginning, middle and ending. That the dental assistant wasn't &#34;in the hay&#34; immediately w/his perverted dentist boss is absurd; the spineless white collar office worker taking the garbage dished out by his boss also absurd; the son turned boss at the chemical plant doing drugs and trash &#34;ladies&#34; in front of everyone even more absurd. If you've got nothing better to do - guess that tells you something abt this reviewer, huh???
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|it is a super great movie and I really enjoy watching it. Will be watching again and again it is a great one
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I have to admit I was really hopeful after reading the reviews and the first 100 pages.  Unfortunately it didn't work for me.  I felt there was way too much about drug use and drinking.  I can't imagine why anyone would compare this work to Dickens.  I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 because I believe it was a quite an undertaking.
B00GM9G476|5.0|very interesting, good acting and true story.  I would recommend this to anyone that<br />is interested in martial arts. thank you
B0095G5AFU|4.0|I love the fact that you can change the covers!! My Kindle Fire HD went haywire with all the apps after I opened this app for the second time (so I'm not sure what's going on, there), but I give this app three-and-a-half stars!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|It loaded good it was better than the real internet on the kindle fire hd it was so so awesome.
B007S3S8HO|3.0|Fun to build but not really a &#34;game&#34; you want to play very often because the pigs and other pieces are a real pain to re-position. Some are very slippery. This is the kind of thing that is best assembled and admired.
B00GINENG0|5.0|It's fun and cool and you can do more than what it says you just have to earn the customizing stuff and follow me on vine at super cupcakes!<br />This game is really fun get it no hesitation
B007ZYJT1U|5.0|A little hard to watch at some points, but all in all a fantastic powerful movie. The title is very deceiving.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love this Game!! Great to play just to pass the time away. My kids love it. My hubby can't get enough. Well made game. Colors are so attractive.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|When I read this book or kept me in total suspense, and I hate reading,read this book, it its very good
B00A2XU9IS|4.0|It's a great app with 1 downside!  It is exactly the same as it was last yr :(my daughter picked right up on that. Plus last yr parents had the option to make it so u could only open 1 window a day,  she had them all done the 2nd day of using this app. It would be awesome if u guys could change it up some before next Christmas season rolls around.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Just read it already. I told you it was awesome. Why are you still reading this? You should be reading the book. Now. Stop being a Weisenheimer.Ok smarty pants, but I'm not the one still reading a review when a perfectly good novel awaits. Go. Grab a comfy lounging location, refreshments, and a do not disturb sign. Class dismissed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book and the other two as well. I wish she would write another. One that would tell of the future.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|If you don't have facebook this this the game to play, I really like playing CastleVille Legends. The graphics are great, the adventurers are fun, you don't have to wait forever to get you items. It's a great game, thank you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Careful guys. If you don't want to get addicted, don't start. If u do, u won't be able to stop.... after several weeks.... I'm still trying to quit its THAT good!!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I'm completely hooked on this series.  The characters are so lovable and the scenery and costumes are amazing!  Love it !
B005PK56TA|5.0|it was amazing! So many plot twists. The characters are great actors and the situations are insane. American Horro Story Season 1 is one of the best suspense/horror stories I've ever watched
0307593525|5.0|We regularly use the wonderful recipes contained in this Julia Child Masterwork.<br />Ms Child is rightly credited with de-mystifying the art, and science, of concocting delicious meals to the joy of family and friends.<br />At almost 100.00usd, retail, it might seem pricey, but to acquire the breadth of 50 years of Ms Child's culinary knowledge, for the thousands of meals which can, and should ensue, makes this a bargain.<br /><br />Like all great books of this ilk, these volumes not only teach preparation, but critical fundamentals as well.<br />It is simply a brilliantly compiled literary masterpiece.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Very good actors.  Realistic, interesting, and emotional plots that have a good ending.  Also, most of the plots have a life learning aspect to them.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|cute movie, wouldn't suggest for very small children though. Our kitten passed away a few weeks after she saw this movie and wanted to know if we could bring it back to life like Frankenweenie. yeah, try explaining that to a 4 year old......
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great game  4 only because it crashes sometimes when dealing with furnaces. (In game, of course. . I know better than to use my phone near super hot appliances)
0399157565|5.0|another awesome book by a great author.....i was without internet for awhile so i am sorry it took awhile to post my review...you did an awesome job of getting it to me so quick
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This story is a great reality to mental health and dealing with being a teenager. Many controversial topics are addressed, but the reality of life is difficult for many teenagers and it does not sugar coat any topic. This book could be used to help give balance to teens dealing with a variety of different stresses.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|its a christmas present for my brother...we both love this show and this is what he asked for..he will love it
0812982622|5.0|This was the best book I've read in years. I wanted to keep reading, but I was afraid of getting to the end; I haven't had that feeling since I was a kid.<br /><br />Set in North Korea, the novel follows an orphan as he grows up and is buffeted by the unpredictable fancies of the North Korean state apparatus. I can't vouch for the authenticity, but Johnson claims to have done years of extensive research and visited DPRK, so I'd bet that this is about as close as you can get. I do feel like I know a little more about life in this hidden corner.<br /><br />The story is heart breaking, as you'd imagine a book in DPRK has to be. The plot is compelling, the characters are heroic and likable, the writing is fine. Highly recommended.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Highly recommended  great game, it has been keeping me out of trouble :) Very addictive. If you want something to keep you occupied during down times this is a wonderful choice
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Choosing Death as a narrator for a story set during the Holocaust is too appropriate and was a poignant counterpoint to the charming main storyline.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was charming and heartwarming.  I loved the girl who saw the good in everyone. LOVE the Minions!  Nice lesson. Very much looking forward to seeing Despicable Me 2.
0307891372|5.0|This was the best deal I found anywhere for this item. It was brand new and free of any defects.
B001FBIPF0|5.0|Great album by them. It sounds almost nothing like their first two and you can definitely see how this was the transition album into the sound that their newest one has. I wasn't so sure if I liked it at first but it really grew on me and now it has some of my favorite songs by them. A must have for fans who are willing to follow their growth and changing sound as a band.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I have never had a bad experience with any of the sellers that I have dealt with including this one. My product has gotten to me in record time. My thanks to all of you!
B00000J631|5.0|This album is a hilarious compilation of older punk songs from some well known bands like NOFX, Green Day, Blink-182, Mad Caddies, Bad Religion, Black Flag, Anti-Flag and tons of songs from bands I've never ever heard of. Most of them are good old crass and crude punk songs about a wide variety or topics. Plus the fact that they're all 30 seconds means it doesn't get boring quickly. Buy it if just for the laughs.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|the game was decent but way to short for five bucks and I hate this being blackmailed into doing a review to get a sequal and more times than not I don't even get it after filling out this thing it should be my choice if I rate it or not I just don't like being slickered. rwh
B001NHNG64|2.0|This would have been a great book if the characters didn't end so many of their sentences with right? I couldn't finish it right? I wanted to like it right? Where was the editor right?
B000VS6QTK|5.0|I'm listening to this right now and can't quit to go do what I'm supposed to on this Saturday.  The audio quality on an audiophile setup (Benchmark DAC1 HDR, Audio Research VSi60 tube amp, Martin Logan Theos speakers) is unbelievably detailed.  I won't review the songs, as I'm a biased AC/DC fan and love them all on this blu ray disc.  The video is first rate.  It's like being at the concert.  It is well worth the money even if you have these songs on CD.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|The navy blue and red lines were really hard to read on my phone, but not on the Kindle. They're really clear.
B0017P7MOO|4.0|Bring a 50 something music lover. Stumbling onto Elbow was like the first time I listen to early Genesis in the 70's. Anyone who's voice and band can take you on a journey with their sound is differently worth the investment. Reading their bio, and how long they have been together, makes me wonder why they aren't much larger in the US. Take a listen.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I have had issues with this app on my cell phone, but not on my Kindle. It works really well.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Read the book even if you loved the movie. I think the first book is better than the movie. Still reading the third in the trilogy.
1591845831|5.0|Well it's Guy Kawasaki so you know it's good content, but I really appreciate his reasoning shared throughout the book.  I feel like I'm getting an MBA in the art of changing things.  He's as inspirational as Seth Godin, but he also offers the nuts & bolts of implementation.  Easy to read and full of enchantment.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|Its an ok book. Not great but not bad. It is written at a fairly low level so it makes for an easy read.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is a great movie for people who love period romances..Richard Armitage has surpassed Colin Firth in my book. I loved every second of it!
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Lord, what a hot mess this movie is. I don't even know where to start.<br /><br />Maybe with the good: Michael Fassbender is undoubtedly actually a robot in real life. Most of the other performances were credible, too. And Ridley Scott does his usual beautiful visuals.<br /><br />Okay, I guess that's about it. The rest is just desperately awful. Story anyone? Was there even a script for this movie, or did a classroom of 14-year-olds just make it up as they went along: &#34;Oooh, this would be cool, let's do that!&#34;? Better stop reading now if you are worried about potential spoilers.<br /><br />Characters in this film almost never behave in a way that suggests any internal consistency, motivation, or correlation with what we assume to be the rules of nature--neither real nature, nor the created world of the movie. It's like they are deciding what to do next by flipping coins or something.<br /><br />For example, Theron's team leader character appears to have no discernible reason whatsoever for being on this spaceship. Fassbender, ever the logical robot, infects the scientist with the alien for no discernible reason whatsoever; for no discernible reason whatsoever, Rapace is able to run around energetically without ripping out her Victorian-era staples and disemboweling herself mere minutes after abdominal surgery (not to mention that there's no discernible reason whatsoever for a high-tech, automated, computerized surgical suite to still be using freaking STAPLES); the alien animal creature somehow manages to display an entirely different natural history every single time it appears, or pupates, or reproduces...or whatever the h__l it's doing when it changes into something random and new for no discernible reason whatsoever. The god-like alien also turns out to be a total pill for--wait for it--no discernible reason whatsoever, despite an opening scene suggesting that these aliens were actually seriously self-sacrificing.<br /><br />Maybe this movie needs the RiffTrax treatment...ffTrax treatment...
B00GIXY4M8|1.0|What a disappointment.  Don't get me wrong, I love Wolverine, X-Men and comic book movies in general.  But the acting was so bad, and I dare say, even from Hugh Jackman, the movie gets one star.  The performances were mailed in.  Little effort was made to make a good story, little effort was made to do the best acting job possible.  This is as bad as a Wolverine movie can get.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great.  No glitches,  Love it on my Note 3, not sure on smaller phones.  Several play modes to choose from. Recommended.
B006LSZECO|5.0|WOW! Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl was so unpredictable! I'm not even going to try to write a summary or synopsis because the storyline changes so much it's insane (in a very thrilling way!). There were so many twists and turns and I could not put this book down!!! Actually, I listened to the audiobook but I had my earbuds in every available second! I am not much for mysteries but I loved this story. It wasn't a who-done-it necessarily, and after a while I learned my lesson and quit trying to guess what was going to happen and just enjoyed the ride. I found myself switching sides over and over until I realized what was really happening and OMG I never expected the true plot of this book!!! The ending left me a little deflated, but after reflection, the ending was consistent with keeping the storyline unpredictable. I would highly recommend this book to any fan of adult contemporary fiction with a mystery element. This story will be coming to the big screen in October 2014 and it's going to be a good one!<br /><br />My favorite quote:<br />“For several years, I had been bored. Not a whining, restless child's boredom (although I was not above that) but a dense blanketing malaise. It seemed to me that there was nothing new to be discovered ever again. Our society was utterly, ruinously derivative (although the word derivative as a criticism is itself derivative). We were the first human beings who would never see see anything for the first time. We stare at the wonders of the world, dull-eyed, underwhelmed. Mona Lisa, the Pyramids, the Empire State Building. Jungle animals on attack, ancient icebergs collapsing, volcanoes erupting. I can't recall a single amazing thing I have seen firsthand that I didn't immediately reference to a movie or TV show. A commercial. You know the awful singsong of blase: Seeeen it. I've literally seen it all, and the worst thing, the thing that makes me want to blow my brains out, is: The secondhand experience is always better. The image is crisper, the view is keener, the camera angle and soundtrack manipulate my emotions in a way reality really can't anymore. I don't know that we are actually human at this point, those of us who are like most of us, who grew up with TV and movies and now the Internet. If we are betrayed, we know the words to say; when a loved one dies, we know the words to say. If we want to play the stud or the smart-ass or the fool, we know the words to say. We are all working from the same dog-eared scripted. It's a very difficult era in which to be a person, just a real, actual person, instead of a collection of personality traits selected from an endless automat of characters. And if all of us are play-acting, there can be no such thing as a soul mate, because we don't have genuine souls. It had gotten to the point where it seemed like nothing matters, because I'm not a real person and neither is anyone else. I would have done anything to feel real again.”risper, the view is keener, the camera angle and soundtrack manipulate my emotions in a way reality really can't anymore.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun.  Challenging.  Starts out deceptively easy.  Then quickly gets harder to the point you can not solve them.  They will allow you to use hints.  But don't use them up early.  There is a limited number and after that you will need to buy them in packages of five or m ore.  Highly recommend.  This one is fun and mentally stimulating, good for all ages.  Kept me sane of a flight form Seattle to Tampa.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Thought it was going to be an action drama, but after the first half it got a little boring, I thought they drew out the ending a little too much.
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|I only just started playing after watching my boyfriend play for a while. I'm having fun customizing all my little characters.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Nice straight forward free cell game with no adds.  It helps me occupy my time.  Got it on a free app of the day so the price was right.
B00BATG18K|5.0|An engaging read. Characters come alive and are three-dimensional people with whom the reader can relate regardless of the time setting. Very well written.
B003SI6C4O|5.0|It was a very good movie, but I only watched it because I am a big fan of Jim Caveizels. I like Denzel, but Jim could have played his part in this movie.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The Polar Express is a favorite Christmas movie for my students and our whole family!  We watch it every year!  Timeless!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Love the series....great tv nostalgia. It was fun to see some famous movie stars in their earlier day playing the villain and matching wits with Peter Falk.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Finding Pendergast again after all he was put through in the last few books made me happy.<br /><br />As anyone who has ever read the first Pendergast book knows the writers take us from disaster to another but giving us hope that the Pendegast they invented would rise again.<br /><br />Each book was suspenseful, surprising  and (on my part) vengeful. Pendergast takes the bad guy down with equanmity!<br />I cannot put any of the books down until my eyelids close.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I don't quite understand how it's played. All of a sudden things happen & I don't know why or how.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The last of the Helen series and so gut-ripping!<br /><br />I am sure that all Pendergast readers either have read this book on tetherhook or will read it soon and find as I did that it put a little bloodlust in your eye for these vilians!<br /><br />I fight and plot with Pendergast!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|really good read, started off a bit slow but then again ...it's king. can't say much more or i'll give it all away.  loved to see what happened to danny t.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|an unbelievable story of battling cancer. A love story between two who share the same illness. i admit at first i was a little confused with the characters. then, as i read along i got the concept. i can not imagine having one of my children battle cancer like they did. i enjoyed everything about the book.
B00E9PMMX0|5.0|I hear a lot of back and forth about the remastered Star Wars films, I personally have no problem with it, and arguing about it is beside the point for a review of a box set DVD's.  We are reviewing the product not the film maker and their decision after all.  So about the product, I love the fact that this comes with both Blu-ray and DVD as I have not commited to a Blu-ray player yet and prefer to wait until I get an Xbox one anyway.  So having both in the same package is great so I can watch it now on DVD and when I do upgrade I can watch it on Blu-ray with out having to but a whole new trilogy box set.  For the price your paying and everything you get from it this is a fantastic deal.  True you don't have any special features but your getting 6 disks for $35 (this is during the time I got it and I do have prime).
B0095G5AFU|5.0|Cuz it's free ;)<br />Please don`t forget me if there`s more luxury goods for free. I would give high ratings to all of them.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Characters: Ares, Aquaman, Azrael, Captain Marvel, and all of the other characters in Injustice console version. Questions: What do dolphins have to do with Lobo? Great gameplay, fun, great, and it needs lower prices!!!! Characters are over priced!
1612680011|5.0|A lot of good information to change the way you think. All families should pass this information to their children.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This was the first flip art I have done.  The graphics are great.  Definately addictive<br />Will look for other games that GabySoft offers.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Excellent movie!!
B00571F26Y|1.0|I did not care for it as it went into to much detail. The theory is right but the reading got boring before I was 1/3 through the book.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Excellent movie...it never gets old!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is good but I wish it had a boat and stuff that is on the Xbox 360. Also I wish you could fly on survival mode.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Written to share the true  dedication and unspoken bravery our Special Forces military  live throughout their service.... We don't thank them enough! They give us their all......<br /><br />Thank you....
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|Not a huge historical fiction fan, I picked up this book on a whim, and was very pleased with the outcome. In my younger years, I did have a bit of a fascination with Nazi Germany and in particular the real and fictional stories that I have discovered about people who lived during that era. This particular take fits well with my previous knowledge, was well written, and used language that made the pages flow easily along. I was very pleased with the way the story developed, loved the characters as they grew and unfolded, and am glad to have added this particular work to my library. Thank you Christoph!!!
006202406X|4.0|The conclusion to Veronica Roth's Divergent series isn't as wonderful and satisfying as the first two books in her series, but it does have it's good points.
B0001ARCFA|3.0|These headphones are a beacon of mediocrity. They sound ok, however they fit a little loose around the ears, and don't suppress outside sound. I should have just got the Beats Audio's!!! These are not terrible, but officially out-dated.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Once again this book was almost as good as the second! Book two and book three in four days for me is a record!
1423136802|5.0|One of the best book series of all, and at what price! highly recommended. Althought they're books intended for children, everyone can enjoy them.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|Oh, this is hilarious!.  I was holding my stomach.  And yet, parts of it are tragic.  You have to be kind of liberal tp enjoy this, and  he can be quite vulgar in places.
B004SIP8BG|5.0|One of my all time favorites! Beautiful imagery. The colors really &#34;pop&#34; on blu-ray. The movie looks great on a big screen :)
B00D3ITOHG|5.0|The sound quality is far beyond my expectation, simply amazing.<br />This is probably the best headphones I've ever used!<br />Highly recommended!
B0089LOG02|4.0|Orphan Train is an excellent book. I liked the way the stories of Molly and Vivien were intertwined.  This friendship was certainly unique.  The Book portrays significant part of our history when children became orphans.  Many sad tales come from that era and are expertly brought to life in Orphan Train.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I'm addicted to this show. I can't wait until the next season comes up. I didn't expect that they would do some of the stuff that they did.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The producers and director did an Awesome job!  I read the books, and, unlike many movies of books, it was not butchered.  Wonderful.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is one of my favorite musicals. I've watched this movie over and over and can still watch it a few more times.
B00ESB75FA|3.0|Not as funny as in the beginning and some jokes and things get old. ! It's my favorite show! Barney 's awesome!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I<br />Love to read and do not very often give up on a book even if I am not crazy about it but so far they have all bean great<br />I also like having my Kindle
B005PK57IK|5.0|Excellent show. I would give it more stars if I could! Each episode draws me in deeper into the lives of the characters. I'm hooked!
B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|Really enjoy this app. The cards I select are always helpful to my situation. Get the full version. I will use this app most everyday.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Excellent show. I would give it more stars if I could! Each episode draws me in deeper into the lives of the characters. I'm hooked!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Oh goodness me! It only took me a day to read this one. Couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. Couldn't help but root for them. However, I kept thinking something more was going to happen and I wasn't let down. Yes, I would recommend this book. But, be warned, has alot of sexy scenes. Looking forward to reading the next one in this series.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|When I heard that Grisham's Sycamore Row, would resurrect Jake Brigance and company, I knew that this was a &#34;must read.&#34;  I was not disappointed.  It was read with the same awe-inspiring breathlessness as A TimeTo a Kill.  Often there were remininces to  the Carl Lee Hailey trial and the same acerbic behaviors of Jake Brigance's fellow attorneys in Clanton, Mississippi.  These playbacks were effective as background to Sycamore Row.  It was terrific, and I hope a movie is in our future.
B0012GMXYM|3.0|You can tell that the band is having a great time making this pleasant music. However if you are an old time Carlos S. fan, maybe this is not your choice.
B008EL25LE|5.0|This is a fun game, and has several ways to play it.  Love the nice quality graphics and storyline, and the music too!  Love it!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|As always I loved the book and could not put it down! I am extremely addicted to Pendergast novels and love all the characters woven in and out of all the Preston & Child books.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|It's a great story.  I'm a fan of the book, the old Hobbit cartoon, and now the movies...  Already bought the theatrical version, even though I was anticipating buying this version--and, as expected, this version is even better, adding another layer of depth and delight to an already wonderfully presented tale.  Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is freaking fantastic! It is also very addicting.  My whole family loves this game.  There isn't a day that goes by that I don't play it.
B002L5CNRA|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies which tells a story about a boy growing up in the Italian district of the Bronx and the many lessons he learns.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|This is a gift for my neice, but it is just what she wanted, so I know she will be happy Christmas morning. Catty Noir is an awesome Monster High doll! Her pink costume is to die for as is her killer hair. Because she is a gift I did not take her out of the box.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Great acting by Denzel Washington which tells a moving story focused on the consequences of alcohol addiction and the challenges in trying to overcome it.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This book is completely absorbing. It is at once philosophical, informative and highly entertaining. Against a historical backdrop that stretches from the voyages of Captain Cook to the publication of Darwin's theories of evolution, Gilbert's wonderfully imagined and impeccably developed characters do their job.  From the beautiful orphan girl with her special needs, to the unattractive but brilliant heroine, to the almost unfathomable mystic who appears late in the story, each one cries out to be understood, loved and remembered.  As readers, we embrace their humanity and come to care about what happens to each and every one. Scene by scene, an unforgettable story unfolds that will leave you thinking.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I've never played a puzzle game quite like this, but they introduced new ideas at just the right pace so I never felt like I didn't know what to do.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Best show/drama ever. I have never paid to watch a tv show. Well worth it. Keep up the grate work. Hope the show never ends.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again I found it impossible to put a Grisham book down. He is a master storyteller and his characters are developed so you not only believe them but you know them. Although I suspected some of the ending, I was unprepared for the emotion. This is a must read for Grisham fans.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|I am a BIG FAN of Big Fish games, the very best.  I love this game, finished it, and went into the Extra game add-on.  So excited.  First scene, a big out snake jumps out at me!  Just to let you know, if you are afraid of them like I am, either have someone play that part, and hopefully another one is not on the story, or do like I did and close my beautiful Kindle instantly.<br />If this does not frighten you, purchase the game, you will love it.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Great game. There are several games within the game including puzzles, hidden objects, etc.  It is also a story if you enjoy reading.  I recommended this game. It's a lot of fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't understand a lot of what's going on, but I absolutely love the game. It can definitely become addictive.
0891419063|5.0|This is a real life story with much of the action included. Made you feel almost like you were alongside the author.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|If you like fighting games or action games than this is for you lots of freebies and lots of people to use
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Incredible story line and acting by all was superb!! A must see, the complexity of what shouldn't be possible but sometimes happens because of various elements that make us human.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great YA read for both young adults and adults. The reader doesn't realize when they become so invested in the intricate characters nor when suddenly the book ends. If you are looking for a similar but non-cancerous book, I highly recommend Say Good Night, Gracie by Julie Reece Deaver.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I had trouble me opening my kik, too. but i deleted it, and redownloaded it, and it let me log in, it was even updated!
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|I really like Blake Shelton and the selections on this CD.  The only drawback, and it's very major to me, is the wording in some of the selections like &#34;Boys Round Here&#34; contain some very inappropriate words.  Those words are not in the songs being played on radio.  I definitely don't like that wording in my house ... forcing me to monitor what is being played when someone is visiting and/or I'm using music as background. I have heard all those words before, but I prefer not to surround myself with them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game. By far my favorite<br />. Whoever thought of this game is somebody with really good ideas. So realistic. Love it.
B009M2T7K6|5.0|It came in perfect condition. It is a x-mas gift for my 3 year old so I am sure she will love it
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Forrest Gump is a film that contains a perfect amount of drama and comedy.  The movie stars Tom Hanks who does a fantastic job as Forrest Gump and wins the audience’s heart by playing a not so smart but loveable man.  There are historical events that Forrest takes part of that gives the audience a good laugh with the twist that is added to the events.  Even though Forrest might not be the smartest apple of the bunch with the way he talks but the audience learns how inside he has a good heart and teaches others that everyone has good within them even rough people like Lieutenant Dan.  Forrest never gives up on the thing he loves, like Jenny, which leads the audience through an emotional rollercoaster. If you like a movie that gives you a laugh and a character who wins your heart Forrest Gump is the movie for you.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I have to admit that the game is great.I love it.you have tons of heroes to choose from in the store
B003CH9PTU|1.0|never meant to purchase it, then was stuck with it did not even watch it. One click purchase is usually convenient but with videos if you click and did not want there is no getting out of the purchase
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun and down time filling .... I do how ever wish that the life would be like 10 not 5 and or the clock run five mins at a time not ten
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The book was a little long and sad for me, but in the end I enjoyed it.  I would recommend the book to friends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't know why I love playing this game.  It keeps me from my reading on the Kindle.  But I can play it even if I don't have a Wi-Fi signal.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|My Kindle keeps coming out of it. It does not snap in correctly. Also when charging there is no space for the cord.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Bond still lives.  And here's why...<br /><br />Casino Royale set the scene.  Underplayed, yet stellar performances from Daniel Craig and the fabulously under-emphasized Eva Green blew people away.  It set the scene perfectly for Bond; the unattached, unattainable leading man.  Able to sear an insincere suitor from a dozen paces, yet captivated by the humanity and vulnerability of a recalcitrant, love-struck, flighty heroine who had previously tried to screw him when she had the upper hand, thinking she held all the cards.  It has always been clear that Bond knew *WHERE* to walk the walk and *HOW* to walk the walk, but he was always human..... for those that deserved it.<br /><br />So....  I felt Casino was a well-thought-out, perhaps even well-relished reboot of the franchise.  An opportunity for the the establishment to wad up the script, throw it over their shoulder and get down to brass tacks:  What defines Bond?  What is, in this day and age, cool?  What would he gravitate to, and what would define him, were he in a specific situation?  With a nerve of cold steel that is...<br /><br />Casino delivered.  From the jaw-dropping intro sequence, through the slightly unbelievable poker game (played with pathos by all concerned, including the awesome Felix Leiter cum Jeffrey Wright (why hasn't he resurfaced yet?).<br /><br />And then, we segued into Quantum, with a paper villain - a shadowy, unconvincing, undefined nobody, and a wishy-washy global cartel of navel-gazing and opera-watching dastardly wannabees.  Le Chiffre was someone who wasn't given the chance to prove his credentials... no fluffy white kitty to pet, no henchmen to discard indiscriminately... nothing to really show his uber-badness.  Quantum missed a beat here.  Bond did his job, but we were left with no over-arching sense of humanity having been saved.  All was right with world, but so what?  Was it really in danger from the beginning with some second rate assault on some cut-price resort in the desert?<br /><br />And so... it was with no small amount of trepidation that I awaited the release of Skyfall.<br /><br />The trailers looked suitably epic!<br /><br />Javier Bardem as villain.....  *squeeeeeeeeee*  ohmigodohmigod.....seriously?!?!  If ever there was an actor who could deliver the pathos to follow Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who could it be other than Javier Bardem, or possibly John Malkovich on a really good (BAD) day, when he wasn't playing John Makovich.  I mean, the villain has to be seriously deranged... and *believably* deranged and devoid of humanity....  either that or he has to be so twisted, so screwed up and savaged by the path of his life that you can genuinely believe his choices when it comes to consigning vast swathes of humanity to the cutting-room floor.<br /><br />But wait!  Skyfall does a neat trick by avoiding that very charged and polarizing battlefield. Instead of there being an implacable wall of minions, under-chiefs, sub-villainesses-cum-sub-heroines and so on and so forth, they cut to the quick and we are left with nothing other than Bond, his murky past, his boss (the fabulously enigmatic and resolute Dame Judi Dench), and the villain.  Ohhhhh, and a reappearance by *THAT* car.  Oh yes!  the DB6 is back!  *sighhhhh*.  If there ever was a Bond Girl swathed in sheet metal, the DB6 was it.  Emphatically and categorically.<br /><br />Put it against the stunning backdrop of the Scottish highlands, and you have half a film in the making, just there!<br /><br />But that isn't quite our climax.  We are left to grapple with a very human finale touching on human frailty, the strength of the desire for revenge, and that indefinable core thread of psychosis that leads the very strongest (on both sides) to stand up beyond the limits of human endurance for what they believe in, no matter what the consequences.  We are shown tantalizing glimpses of the Genesis of Bond - a gamekeeper that predates him, more of the resolute and yet all too human Judi Dench in an unwinnable situation that Bond gets to disregard most of the time, a shotgun with the timeless and poignant initials AB (thanks Cubby!), and a sizable dash of suitably Hollywood cinematic pyrotechnics!<br /><br />I arrived at the point of sitting down to watch this film, over a year and a half after its cinematic debut, in knowing two major plot spoilers. *Both* of which, I had expected, would bias my view of, and taint my enjoyment of, this film.  I am extremely glad that this was NOT the case.  And let me make it perfectly clear why.  I feel that here are a number of all-too-human saving graces in this film which have converted me from Casino-lover and Quantum-hater, into Skyfall-Revenant and carrier-of-belief-for-that-which-comes-next:  We were given Casino Royale... with the setting.... the Hero.... the Heroine.... the poker... The Aston..... the betrayal... did we really need any more plot elements?  And that Intro Sequence and chase?  Stellar!  That was enough for one film, in the way it was delivered, as a story with historical significance (minus the awkward product placement... thank you Ford), to say \\"This is the Genesis of Bond.  Let's skip Quantum....<br /><br />This is more of Why.<br /><br />This is more of Where.<br /><br />This is more of How-He-Came-To-Be, after he was tempered in the fires of Casino Royale.  Forged in tragedy, tempered by his own strengths and the frailty of human weaknesses and temptation, we get to see how Bond flexes when stretched past the point of reasonable human response.<br /><br />With all his strengths, and with all of his weaknesses and faults, there is still a pinch of humor, a sense of wanting to have fun going forward, and to tip the hat to what has been, whilst acknowledging how far the spy game has moved forward in the past 50 years.  Because, this *IS* a demi-centennial release!  Who would have thought it when Ursula Andress reared up out of the waves in all her stunning glory?  When will we have a Bond Girl to take the script, and rip it up and steal the camera in the same way she did?<br /><br />So, we have less of an over-arching storyline than we did with Casino and Quantum, and  yet, to me, a far more satisfyingly human story (especially towards the end) of human protagonists in inhuman roles, with stakes way beyond what any mere mortal should have to deal with, yet which are considered normal (or even boring) by human (or Hollywood) standards.<br /><br />I shall refrain from spoiling the script any further.  Suffice it to say I would highly recommend it to those that loved \\"Casino\\" and hated \\"Quantum\\", and even to those that loved both.  I especially appreciate their willingness to show the humanity of Bond, and despite \\"the-reboot-franchise-to-follow-what-went-before\\", an attempt to address the concept of Bond at 50, thanks to a fairly gracefully aging Daniel Craig.<br /><br />This is a throwback that defies modern expectations of an overly bombastic Hollywood finale in favor of a work that tries to take into account the past (and its fans), the current protagonists, and the need for a vaguely believable plot, script and denouement.  Ugggh, but there are casualties..... especially those swathed in sheet metal.... and yes, that's casualties, plural.  I will spoil no more.<br /><br />Given that I am so late to the game, this won't be news to most people.  I hope the franchise can take things onwards and upwards from here, and that they will be able to keep things fresh, and revitalize Q division following the \\"departure\\" of Desmond Llewellyn and the abortive appearances of John Cleese, who could have done well here.<br /><br />In summary, a good recovery from Quantum, and a good starting point for Bond to begin to have an inkling of the world-wide dominance of Spectre and a modern day showdown with a suitable Blofeld replacement.<br /><br />Here's hoping!i Dench in an unwinnable situation that Bond gets to disregard most of the time, a shotgun with the timeless and poignant initials AB (thanks Cubby!), and a sizable dash of suitably Hollywood cinematic pyrotechnics!<br /><br />I arrived at the point of sitting down to watch this film, over a year and a half after its cinematic debut, in knowing two major plot spoilers. *Both* of which, I had expected, would bias my view of, and taint my enjoyment of, this film.

B00BAXFECK|1.0|Simply the most tedious book I've picked up in ages. Perhaps if I could have stomacher more than 90 or 100 pages it would have gotten better. Second book in several years I simply could not finish. Wish I could get my money back.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game was confusing to get started, but once I figured out it out it was no longer hard to get into it solve. And the pictures are better than most.<br />Well worth the confusion
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Typical Jack Reacher adventure. Move a little faster than some of his earlier books. Holds your attention right to the end!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a very good game it's one of my faves under terraia this game and terraira are worth the money but it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game minion rush Is a great game for kids I love and would recomand you try the game and your kids will love it.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book tells the TRUTH about grains and the oxymoron of &#34;healthy grains&#34; or &#34;good bread&#34;...there is no such thing.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|As with all of 22L's games I found this one to be a fun, colorful, and interactive learning experience.<br /><br />I love that children can play the game by themselves since it is so easy to use.  And with the sheer number of puzzles included it keeps children engaged for quite a while.<br /><br />The graphics are fun - the little crabs are adorable!  Everything is sized just right for little hands as well.<br /><br />I also like that the game repeats each letter several times as this really reinforces the learning.<br /><br />This is among my favorite educational apps and I highly recommend it!
006441034X|2.0|I have watched the Howl's Moving Castle on TV many times and  enjoyed it very much.  So when Amazon had the  book for sale I thought it would be  wonderful to have.<br /><br />I was so excited when I received the  book, then I started reading and I do not like it at all.  I thought it was terrible.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Almost everyone has seen this movie before but our church had used this show as a basis for a new sermon series about the movies of Christmas and faith. I really enjoyed watching it again and thinking about &#34;the lovely intangibles&#34; of life. Very deep movie when you look beneath the surface.
1612930859|5.0|I chose this rating because it is one of my favorite stories.  So  when  I was able to  buy  the book  from  Amazon at such a reasonable price it was too good of deal to  pass up.  Also from my experience with Amazon  I knew it  would be a getting the best service.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Refreshing read!  Susan had me sitting on the edge of my seat eager to read to the very end!  Bravo.  On to book two...
B0083Z614S|5.0|Even if written for children, I enjoyed it from cover to cover. A hymn to enjoying life in full. Recommended as best holiday reading
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read this story because a friend told me the movie was coming out and I always want to read the &#34;real&#34; story before seeing a movie.  After reading this book, however, I have no desire to see the movie.  The movie could not possibly live up the beautiful story told in the pages of this book.  I haven't been so moved by a story or by the beauty of the prose with which the story was told in a long, long time.  The words on the page are like the brush strokes of an artist.  I had to read and re-read paragraphs just to soak them in.  And then there were pages I had to turn quickly because the story was gripping.  I want to read this book again.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good story and who appreciates the artistry of good writing.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie before reading the book.  The movie captures the spirit of the book quite admirably.  As to be expected the depth of the characters is far richer in print.  I give great praise to the movie for capturing the strong of community  that Katniss Haas for her home district.  What the movie misses is the degree of transition from transition girl-Hunter to girl-warrior.
1616550414|1.0|Weird, disjointed.  No real narrative or any story or anything in here.  Just kind of a mumbo jumbo of all the old games.  No gems or easter eggs or anything really cool.  Not what I was expecting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive and fun.  Like the fact that it makes you wait a time to continue game.  That way it doesn't seem quite so addictive.
B003AWRMCE|5.0|It's Clint Eastwood and it's a western, what's not to like? You can never go wrong with a combination like that. Eastwood made several classic westerns and this one was one of the top one or two.
1933633867|2.0|Disappointed, it is hard to read. I heard the author interviewed on KQED , but the book drags. I haven't been able to finish it.
B004132HZS|2.0|I love Sherlock from Basil Rathbone on down, but this time the Americans get the nod for a mystery series....Elementary does it bettter.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book gripped me and held my attention until the very end.  It was well written as we got to know the characters and felt like we were part of their lives.  I would love more books centering around the same lawyers, town and people.  What a great story!
B00BAXFECK|1.0|I could not finish it.  The writing is good but I thought it too engrossed in adolescent miscreant self destructive behavior.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy this game.  Find it challenging but something to do while watching TV. Can play this easily on my kindle fire.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Great series.  Loved the characters.  I watch it over and over.  Sorry  to see it end.  However also bought the  movie they made later to show the kids all grown up.  Very  clean and heart warming.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|I have to be honest, I can’t quite understand the vitriol that some people have harboured towards this film.  The idea of making another film in the world of Oz seems at first to be sacriligeous.. and yet as the movie rumbled on past the slightly overlong prologue in ‘real world’, I found myself quite enchanted.  For sure, it was more by the spectacle – the colours and definition really pop off the screen in this bluray edition.  But the story works, even if the lines the actors are given can be a bit clunky, and there is a genuine sense of wonder in seeing this world.  It’s one of the most satisfying blend of special effects and cgi working seamlessly to make the story work I’ve seen in a while.  Talking monkeys have never been so believable.<br />To give away anything about the plot would be a shame, sufficient to say it is about the origins of the Wizard of Oz, and his confrontation with the wicked witch.  What’s more important is that it’s a treat to have a movie transport you somewhere, and this movie does that, particularly from the moment the sepia toned opening to the widescreen visually spectacular world of Oz.  In that regard, Sam Raimi was just the man for this job, making a movie that stands on its own merit, with his Raimi touches giving it just the right amount of darkness, and yet with sufficient nods and homages to the original for the observant and imagination in abundance.  If the acting can be theatrical, it’s because this is a fable not kitchen sink drama.  The cast are more or less up to the task.. Franco is a slightly odd choice for the wizard, but it works, not least because of the support from Rachel Weisz in a fine performance.  Mila Kunis and Michelle Williams do an ok job of keeping up with Weisz’s bad witch schtick, but Williams in particular seems to struggle a bit to give her character any dimension..  In short, it’s the sort of movie that is more likely to tell you about the characters feeling or direction throughtheir makeup and wardrobe than the acting or script.<br />Nothing is likely to match the hold on people’s hearts the original has, but we could hardly expect a more satisfying blend of spectacle, drama and a little humour than this.  The sugar rush you get from the most lovingly and imaginatively created world zinging off the screen more than compensates for the lack of spice in the chemistry of the leads. (8/10)
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a wonderful  series.  I have watched it many times.  My daughter and my grand daughter have purchased  the set as well. We all  loved it and was sorry that it ended so suddenly.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Stupid and mindless.  Games that expand your mind would be more valuable.  It is a total waste of my time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the start of a love affair with these books. They are well written and surprisingly humorous. There is a lot of adult content so if you don't like that kind of book then this is not for you. :-)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have enjoyed the series on HBO and got into reading, now I can relate better to the shows. I was not much of a reader until I got my Kindle Fire HD now I love to read
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|What can I say? I love this game. Although with the holidays here I find less time to play but it's very addicting. It's fun and makes you use your mind. You just can't put it down.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Great game but I need more puzzles.  I am going thru them again for the 4th time.  Please make more!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Can't say enough good things about this series of books. It draws you in and you just can't put it down. It is an adult book so if your shy about things of a sexual content then these books are definitely not for you. :-)
B006BFK5DK|5.0|This new album is so good.  I love EWF but sometimes get tired of listening to the old standbys.  Each song is its own special gem and I agree that The Promise and Sign On are the best singles to release.  I love the jazzier instrumentals that show off the great musicians; they make me think of Earl Klugh and Keola Beamer somehow.  Thank you for carrying on the dream for all of us!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great series of books. If you get the first one you have to buy the rest. You just have to. They are of adult content so if you're shy about sexual content then don't buy the book. Just don't :-)
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|Amanda Root is delightful in one of my favorite Austen stories. I also enjoyed Ciaran Hinds in this adaptation.  And those sisters are just so annoying!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love Google search. It's easy to use and fast. I use it everyday. The updated Google Chrome is awesome as well!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|it keeps saying that it has failed to install. i have a kindle fire but not the newest one. it does the download bar all the way and then gives a ln error message
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Amazing app from Valve. I wish the PC version had a clear chat history button like the app does. 5 stars.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Major twist in storyline but I loved it. Really makes you wonder about medicine and personality these days. Some people are just crazy.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Michael Connelly's books are always well written, especially the wheeling and dealing in the legal profession, Nothing is black or white but a constant grey- as in true life.
1476727651|2.0|I have read every Stephen King book that he has written and I'm sorry to say that this is subpar. The Shining was fantastic. This is not scary , kind of a different take on a vampire theme. I was expecting something much better and I was very disappointed.
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|very good album. It's a little different than most of his previous albums. It took a couple listens to really like it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|what I like about this game is that you can create any robot and then you fight but the only thing u don't like is that I takes to long to download the game but its sick
B00FATEJYE|5.0|THE BEST FIGHTING GAME SINCE THE ORIGINAL MORTAL COMBAT CAME OUT. ABSOLUTELY AWESOME GRAPHICS GREAT GAME PLAY NICE UPGRADES ALL AROUND ADDICTIVE LOVE IT
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|not same as the picture, so cheap for iphone 5s gold color.will not buy this brand again, use elago brand.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Exciting, fast moving, a really good read.  Plenty of plot twists.  King and Maxwell are interesting characters.  I enjoyed the adventure!
B001EBV0P8|5.0|As one viewer put it, this is the best movie to never have received an Oscar that was ever made.  This isn't worth a second viewing, it's worth a 10th, 11th, and even 15th viewing.  I don't pretend to be a professional reviwer, but my opinion is that this is probably one of the best movies ever made.  Forget the Godfather, forget anything with Robert Redford or Paul Newman, forget any Woody Allen film ever made - the chemistry between Morgan Freeman as &#34;Red&#34; and Tim Robbins as &#34;Andy Dufresne&#34; is both unforgettable and unrepeatable in it's essence.  There are few 'extra's in this film - each man becomes that character (with Gil Bellows and James Whitmore especially memorable).  I can't say much more.  The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time - and it always will be.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this sweet-sad story with its ups and down, joys and disappointments.  The author's ending comments were amazing, making it an almost inspired writing from her perspective.  Add it to your &#34;must read&#34; list.  An insight into history retold through the lives of believable people, some you will love and others, loath. .
B0084IG8TM|5.0|ok this is in my opion the greatest movie that has ever been made. i went to see this against my will not know anything about this so you can imagine by the title i was like hunger what? but after watching this movie it had me on the edge of my seat till the very last second when they ended the movie leaving my hanging want to know what will happen. its a really hard movie to describe it better to watch the movie to understand how complex it is.
B004TL0J5M|4.0|Connelly does it again. Haller is at his best in defense of a screwed up client and pulls out all the stops to see justice is done. But is it ?<br /><br />Also, excellent work on the personal side as we see Haller wrestle with his demons and the impact to his family and relationships of the choices he has made.
B008JFUORW|3.0|im glad and sad that they decided to end a really good movie series before it gets really bad but this part 3 has me wondering if it just should have been ended on the second. this movie was good but it really lacked that classic hangover vibe. kind of like they forgot what made this movie so great to begin with it. still worth a rent though.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The emotional ride that this series takes you on is amazing. I would recommend this series to anyone. far better then the movies
B005OCFGTO|5.0|this has to be my greatest memorie of my childhood. this is a really amazing series that is based on a series of books turned reality. this is something that needs to be experienced and give as a gift.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Liam Neeson is an excellent actor. He doesn't miss a beat in this suspenseful thriller. He saves his daughter after being kidnapped while being on the phone with her.
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|first off i watched this on the big screen and knew from the previews that this movie would be a riot and it is the most rottenly funny movie that i have watched in a long time. i don't think that their really is a dull moment in the whole movie. this was a great cast that made this movie the only thing that i would say is don't let young kids watch this movie. its not due to excessive nudity it just the suggestive terms that they use and the couple parts that are a little questionable.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was so excited to start, then so disappointed at the end. Don't waste your time. You could imagine a better ending.
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|well this a great war movie that is made here and it may not have the best acting in the world but the contents of what is portrayed means more to me and the action is of the wall. this is something that needs to be added to a collection of movies.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is an easy review. You cannot buy a more useful piece of tech for $35. This device fits my needs perfectly. Between casting YouTube and Google TV/Movies it does it all....well...just about. The only thing missing is Amazon Instant integration. Fingers crossed for the future but not holding my breath.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|This book was worth waiting for. I never can put it down. It is full of interesting forensic details and the murderer profiling thrilling
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing series. I read each of the three books. Plenty of twists, highs and lows with great character development. You really become fond of some of the characters. Read the series in order. The movie was good, the book is better!
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|Not my favorite. Didn't get the results I was looking for. Maybe worked 1 out of 10 times. Difficult to use.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought each of the kindle editions separately so it won't show I bought this. Having said that, this is an amazing series. I read each of the three books. Plenty of twists, highs and lows with great character development. You really become fond of some of the characters.  The movie was good, the series in book is better!
B008BU75IQ|3.0|too much retelling of the previous book. And leaving reader ready for next one. By itself, it just feels like a bridge for 2 other books
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love science fiction. This is in my opinion a must read. Great character development, twists and turns and a surprise ending. I also read Speaker for the Dead after this, recommend that one as well.
B0020BUWX2|3.0|Some parts of this book were really fascinating but it was difficult to follow. In all this was a nice quick read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an amazing series. I read each of the three books. Plenty of twists, highs and lows with great character development. You really become fond of some of the characters. Read the series in order. The movie was good, the series in book is better!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was under the impression that I could plug this into my TV quickly, easily, and have access to all my Internet stuff.  I have an older DLP HDTV, so it's becoming more trouble than it's worth!  Very frustrating, it took time and research to figure out, it won't play on my TV without another $40 adapter!  I would not suggested it for people who are not good with technology, or don't have someone to help them.  Also not so great for us seniors who are on limited budget!<br />Anita
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|There are times when writing a review that you wonder 3, 4 or five stars for a good to solid read. No doubts here, 5 stars all the way. Great follow up to the Shining. Would recommend that you have read or at least seen the movie for the Shining. Not completely necessary but you'll care and follow more. Stephen King is at the top of his game here. Won't describe as others and Amazon have done solid work there.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|So fun having Matt Smith and David Tennant together!!  Pretty intense but what an awesome ending! Loved it! Can't wait for more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is an amazing series. I read each of the three books. Plenty of twists, highs and lows with great character development. You really become fond of some of the characters. Read the series in order. The movie was good, the series in book is better!
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|This is an excellent tv series that probes the human psyche as much as it does space. Highly recommended for audiences of all ages.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I have read both Enders Game and this one. In my opinion Enders Game was better as there was more action and things going on. This is more story than action. That said, I like this one as well just not as much. Still a great read though.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is very easy to use and very handy. Thanks for designing such a great tool! Just need a good calendar tool now.
B009IU6BIS|4.0|I will never go a christmas without watching this movie, and it nice to be able to do it without commercials.
B00AH69MS8|5.0|Classic album, one of the best ever.  If you like metal this is a must own.  IS there really anything else to say?
B007HACDLK|4.0|I liked the series I read them all now what? I can't believe Vince Flynn won't be writing any more...
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The older I get, the less Sci-Fi fan I become. No reflection on the quality of the picture production. Just me.
B0007G89G4|5.0|classic move and a great  deal im glad i found it on here ! i hope other people can share in such deals
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game on facebook and its great to be able to have it on my kindle so I can play it wherever I am.
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|This case looks very nice in the iPhone 5S. I like that it has the clear back and it doesn't cover the back of the phone. Great quality and great price.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Like this newest version better. Has less steps in creating the houses and shops. The graphics are still crisp and engaging.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|Want to see additional seasons, it took a few episodes before I could decide if I liked it or not
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is soo addictive it's soo great and stop much fun<br />Definitely would recommend this game to anyone  it's great
B00GD9F59S|5.0|This book was amazing,  awesome ending to a great series!  Loved these books and most anything from Jennifer L. Armentrout.
B005COO1X6|3.0|A fun short for the beach or a cold winter's night. Creepy, dark and not predictable. Mr. King does like evil cars which is amusing.
B002YK8OKC|5.0|Always very funny.  A great group of actors that can be very convincing as to their quirky personalities.  I have seen this movie at least a dozen times and may see it a dozen more.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Fun, enjoyable movie.  The chemistry between everyone is perfect.  John Malkovich is even more funny in the sequel.  Hopefully they have a few more installments in the works.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it because it is just to fun to not play like who dosent want a horse. it is fabtabulus
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Only recently learned of this talented group of young men and had to have more of their music.  Too bad I couldn't watch them as they make music.
B000I9WW4U|5.0|Al Pacino gives a riveting and brilliant performance as a blind, retired Lt. Colonel.  I don't know how any actor could keep up, but Chris O'Donnell not only keeps up, but is just as phenomenal playing his role. And, Gabrielle Anwar, wow, her part is short, but with the tango scene, she almost steals the show! Her sweetness is absolutely charming and delightful! Love the movie and will watch it again!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I am amazed by what these young men do!  I love their music. Talent and innovation seem to be their specialty.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Great documentary of soundcity's history featuring all the great rock lock legends that once recorded there. Get ready for a trip down memory lane!
B0089LOG02|2.0|Not a good read.<br />It is hard to keep up with the characters. There are flashbacks and it is a bit confusing. Do not recommend it.
B007CMD420|5.0|I can't give this album enough stars! The production is soooo clean & sweet it's scary. I realize some artists don't want to be stereotyped, following the same ol formula, but if opeth doesn't try to recreate this intricate, mellow, dark prog they're missing the boat! They may never make another album this good again. Here's hoping they'll at least try!
0345803485|1.0|I cannot understand why this book received the response that it did. I had a LIST of questions for the author but realized that it was a waste of time.  One of the many questions I had was; why on earth were there so many MURMURS? Why are adults murmuring? Oh and also why would she flush at the simplest, slightest and stupidest things? Its as if she lived in the dark ages or under a rock! In the end again...a waste of time.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|It rocks! what more can I say. I didn't care for the rap but that is me. I do love her music and she makes your tired ass get up and dance. LOL!
B0095G5AFU|5.0|After trying several apps as nice as they seemed to be this one Notebook pro is absolutely the best. Wish I found this sooner.
B00DO0ZNK0|4.0|Most songs are good stoner rock.  Sound a bit like Kylesa, but a bit more straight forward rock.  A good listen.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Such a great product--affordable and made well! One thing specifically I love about it that isn't in the product description is that it is narrow enough to not hinder its neighbor plugs. A lot of times these bigger plug-ins will use one plug then cover up all or part of another one.
B008M721MS|3.0|I love Skype but this app has a lot of problems. Ever since I updated it crashes and takes about 10 minutes to load new messages sometimes. When it does work though I love it. It's basically just like regular skype and you can message, be on call, be on video call, and even send video messages. It's a lot of fun to interact with others on it. I would give it 5 stars for the actual Skype experience but this particular app is very buggy.
B008LXZFH6|5.0|Funny, great acting, streamed really well. Thanks amazon for offering this and so many other movies. I couldn't find this streaming anywhere else online!
B00A757EFW|3.0|I don't like the controls much on this app but it is what it is. I was expecting the game to be played by dragging your finger where you want the pac man to go. How you really play is you control a &#34;joystick&#34; on the bottom of the screen below the actual game. It's a little weird getting used to and can be difficult once the levels get harder. It's pac man though in all aspects, graphics, pieces, music, etc.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|love this game loaded on my kindle great and it is very addictive there is only 2 worlds with over 80 levels each wish there was more love it
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|This app is a little fast paced. I am a little familiar with the language I'm learning on it (German) so I am using this app more of a refresher. If you have never learned the language before or know absolutely nothing about the new language you want to learn I can see this app being difficult for you. Give it a try though if you are a fast learner. It's takes a little bit getting used to how they want you to input things but for the most part this is a pretty good app considering it's free.
B005HE5J7I|5.0|Lost myself in this novel!  It is long and sometime you end to concentrate hard on the story as it goes into great detail. Sometimes I got lost down a bunny hole but persevere -it's a book that transfers you to the historical times:  you can see feel and smell the surroundings as if you've stepped into the pages of the book. I've recommended this to many friends who are fans of historical novels.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I prefer s over my own alarm. I like that it gradually gets louder. Good alarm that does the job
B001HN6EF4|5.0|A great gift to send to your summer camper!  Stays clean and the plastic is good quality and easy to play with. A fantastic idea for an iconic card game. Love. Highly recommend!
B000F8O35U|1.0|The DVD is not an authentic Disney copy. Whoever &#34;Jacktheripper&#34; is, created the burned copy. It looks VERY authentic, but the coding isn't original.
B0087FMUCQ|2.0|I played this game briefly and it seemed like a fine little time-waster.  Later, while offline, I tried to play again, and it said I had to be logged in to the the App Store to run the app!  I don't mind so much the apps that need to log in to their motherships to tattle on anything of a commercial nature they may have learned about me since their last login--but seriously--the App Store?  Why does it insist on being logged in to the App Store?  If I want to buy something, I can login myself.  I've uninstalled the app.
0062235893|1.0|Not the full book, only four pages. Don't buy this thing. It's fuzzy and that's about it. No reason to buy this thing if you have the original book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Fantastic! I'm not much of a reader but I watched the movie and wanted to read the book I like the differences. Good read!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|...Wait, no, it isn't.<br /><br /> I am not at all picky about what I read to be entertained. I love good literature, but there are times where I just like to read something totally mindless, and it is from this perspective that I have read 50 Shades, and is the only reason I have not gone into a rage about the total lack of quality. Because there's no way around it: this book is really, REALLY awful.<br /><br />There's a lot I could say, but most of it's been said, so I'll stick with this:<br /><br />Vagina. Just say the freakin' word. Seriously. I'm tired of it being all &#34;down there&#34; or &#34;my sex&#34;. If you're going to write erotica, call ladyparts what they are.<br /><br />In other news, this whole  &#34;inner goddess&#34; and personified subconscious business is making me a tad concerned. Or am I the only one that finds the fact that miss socially awkward prude-tastic protagonist is constantly having inner dialogue with two other people like that?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book grabs your attention from beginning to end. I loved that it always kept you guessing. This book also really makes you think about the future and how it can change us because when it comes to war there is always difficult choices to make for our survival.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I've always loved the trilogy and the author the book is so great because of the authors ability to describe a scene and the charactors
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|As much as I would like to agree with all of the above reviews I simply can not. Jamie McGuire obviously knows how to trance you from your wold into the life of her characters. As I read the book I found myself feeling the pain, love, and worry that Abby(Pigeon) and Travis felt with each word I read. This book is not downing the female race, instead it gives it hope. It shows that while there are some women out there with no respect for their body, there are women like Abby Abernathy who refuse to give that part of herself up so easily. It also proved that women like Abby get the guy in the end, unlike the bimbos who threw themselves at Travis so willingly. Clearly oblivious to Travis's charm is what wins his heart in the end. Similar to Abby, I found myself wanting to hate Travis for his childlike behavior but simply could not. I understood his pain of losing a parent, and the need to fill a hole long ago made. For Travis his coping mechanism was sex, disgraceful and utterly horrifying as it were, it was understandable. Something you aren't told in this book, but in the second book Walking Disaster is what justifies his behavior with women. Although, the bit of information revealed is no excuse for his sleeping with every woman that walked his way. While I clearly don't like Travis's behavior, I can not and will not hate him. It is truly a wonderful book! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone! I suggest reading Walking Disaster before making a review, it will clarify Travis's actions.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|One day was all it took to finish, I guess you could say it is a quick read; however, it is so much more than that. The novel spans over just under 300 pages, and it hooks you from the start. The story is well written, and I could not put it down. The situations depicted in it are easy to relate to, and if you are in high school I strongly suggest giving this book a chance you will not regret it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Addicting.... can't wait until they come out with more levels. Works great on a kindle fire HD . Hope this helps.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|the first Bond film that treats characters other than Bond as major characters rather than cameos...eg Judy Dench as a living breathing  &#34;M&#34;, with attitude...returns and &#34;retires&#34;...is it an Aston-Martin, not to mention Skyfall in Bond&#34;s heritage.  Great special effects, Adele and Bardun.  What's not to like?
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|this is a great app. I use it everyday. I have uploaded different mp3s into dropbox, the google drive and skydrive. this keeps them all accesssible on my Kindle Fires.
B00DQZT38G|3.0|Like the several previous reviews the case is okay (probably 2.5 stars rather than 3).  For the price it could be a little more sturdy. It does fit the HDX 8.9 nicely though and it looks nice.  And it's much lighter than the Origami case (that must weigh 3x the Kindle). I have a Marware case for a Kindle HD 7 that is much better.  I was hoping this new case would be similar to that one but it's not.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi  Carlile has an outstanding voice. This is a really great album.  Ms. Carlile has the type of voice that can sing most anything and make it enjoyable.
B00E0SX118|5.0|I love this movie, as well as do my kids! We saw it in theater and couldn't wait for it to come out to own! Great, funny!
0446556726|5.0|I've read 5-6 of the Bosch series and this is the best. Great story well written. I'm becoming a bigger and bigger fan of Connelly.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I've always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes, and I love the way they did this! They also chose great actors for the roles.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Classic movie on sales, salesmen and salesmanship. Anyone debating a career in sales needs to see this movie. Tin Men is another one to watch.
B00ECU1A6C|3.0|When I first heard about this i was quite skeptical, though,  after watching it makes more sense. It actually isn't that bad of show, cute and teaches lessons about friendship and kindness.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is so lifelike and it is such a great and addictive game. YOU NEED TO PLAY IT!!!<br /> Anyone who doesn't like this game is insane.
B006QPVH6O|4.0|I remember the Apollo missions and this film does a great job of capturing the feel of those missions, and adds in isolation and dread. The movie kept me engaged in the story, and really worked for me. It was very believable, and had me thinking &#34;what if&#34; the whole time.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Iv'e never read a book that was so exhausting to read. Mae is happy to leave her job at a local utility because its boring or mundane or beneath her. Luckily she is able to land a job at The Circle where she begins working in another mundane and repetitive position but she never sees it like this. The Circle is the ultimate in social media and it makes Google, Amazon and Apple look like they are being run by some kid in their parents basement. The ultimate goal of The Circle is openness and transparency. While most people wouldn't want all this information, theirs or others, out in the universe all Circlers feel that and to not share is selfish and tantamount to a crime. While writing this review on amazon after reading it on my kindle which luckily synched with the Kindle app on my Iphone when I was on the go without my Kindle the scary part of The Circle is that none of the technology or capabilities see in this book seem impossible. Sure at some point there could be some legal issues but this is even covered and written off in the novel. After reading this book people will either be left thinking wow today's social media really isn't that bad or leave them rushing to cancel all their accounts.
B00E9P959O|3.0|Very listenable and I'm a Rush fan, but doesn't have what I would consider a hit. I went to 2 of the concerts promoting this CD and still it leaves me feeling so-so about it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|thx sooo much for makeing this its. so fun already. on level. 26 or 28. thx little girl. who loves it
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved the book, all the connections to each other were amazing the very last part was a welcomed surprised a beautiful way to end this book.
B00G922EA2|4.0|Some of the puzzles were hard to know what to do.  But I really enjoyed playing this game.  The graphics were great. I played on the kindle fire
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love games with patterns and bright colours. Prefer those which engage the right brain and allow me to just react. This is one of them. I'm only on the beginner slope and looking forward to the higher  levels<br />LeeM
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|Dune.....possible THE BEST book I have ever read! Frank Herbert has created  universe comparable to LOTR. Excuse me while I go back and read the book again and again.
B009TGODOK|3.0|An interesting story, and well done, but I don't like the morals portrayed.  I suppose it could be considered a lesson in the way not to live.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|so I downloaded game started playing and instantly I'm addicted!!! spent hours playing then all of a sudden it crashes. when I try to reopen game it just crashes before finishing its download process. extremely disappointing I had a beautiful village and lots of paid for acorns.I love the game but what's love got to do with it if you cant play it! :(

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Missing features<br />Wired network connection. This is a streaming device, needs stable network connection.<br />Support for 5GHz wifi.<br />Support for hidden networks.<br />Turn off control light. It is annoying to see it behind the tv, especially when it's blinking.<br /><br />It does well what it supports. YouTube and Google Play work without any problem in the UK.<br /><br />Chrome plugin now has experimental screencast (20 November 2013). It is working but needs a little more work, i.e. to fit the screen because now top and bottom are not visible. This is not casting a tab, it is mirroring the entire computer screen and only works on computers yet.<br /><br />It is not switching on Panasonic Viera TX-L42B6B TV. It's not switching inputs either.<br />I don't know if this is a software issue in Chromecast or an issue with the TV. The TV does switch to other HDMI sources automatically.<br /><br />YouTube play settings like Annotations, speed and quality are not applied to Chromecast when selected in Chrome browser on a laptop.<br />It seems it always tries to play the highest quality what makes some videos not play because connection speed is too slow for HD quality and never stops buffering.<br /><br />I had many issues connecting Chromecast to my wifi network. After spending long time with trying out different settings I found the issue was that router was set to use a specific channel and for some reason Chromecast couldn't see that channel (I think it was 12). It worked with another channel though.<br /><br />Update 23 November 2013<br />It seems there was a software update (definitely to the Android app) and now all available wireless networks are listed in app including hidden ones and hidden can be set to Chromecast and it works with it. Hooray.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|perfect for my iphone.  I use it more than I thought i would.  it's simple to use.  I use it to calculate sale prices and tips

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I am a Rosetta Stone user.  If you use Rosetta Stone, you know two things about it.  First, it works.  Second, it is expensive.  When you pick apart Rosetta Stone and Duolingo, you find that by-and-large, they teach languages the same way.  Yes, there are differences in the user interface, etc., but the similarities are uncanny.  Because of this, Duolingo works.<br /><br />Why do I prefer Duolingo over Rosetta Stone?  Many reasons.  First, it is fast.  The user experience on Rosetta Stone is slow.  Transition between screens can be maddening.  Duolingo speeds between screens just about as fast as your brain can process.<br /><br />Second, you can run Duolingo on your mobile device AND online through your browser.  The experience on my Nexus 7 is great, but the experience on my laptop is much better.  Having a choice is wonderful!<br /><br />Third, Duolingo tracks progress in a fun, cutesy way that actually encourages me to use it every day.  I never would have thought myself to be one of those people who work harder to earn the little gems and progress badges, because they seem childish.  Well, I love them!  They keep me working on my language studies far longer on any given day than I EVER did with Rosetta Stone.  Duolingo is FUN.  Rosetta Stone is work.<br /><br />Fourth, Duolingo tracks how you are doing on individual concepts and words.  There is button which allows you to go back and have the application work with you on your weakest vocabulary words.  If Rosetta Stone has that, I never saw it.  Practice makes perfect, and Duolingo excels when it comes to practice.<br /><br />Fifth, Duolingo is free.  How it is free is beyond me.  When Rosetta Stone can cost hundreds of dollars (per language), that this is free is nothing short of amazing.  Even better, there are a number of languages covered--Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese...and they all work the same way.  With the way Duolingo is day, I'd gladly pay $100 for it.  Free?  I keep looking for the catch, but find none.  Incredible!!!<br /><br />Sixth, Seventh, Eighth...well, you get the idea.  I love Duolingo.  It's a great product and better (in my opinion) than Rosetta Stone.  Since it's free, try it.  You have nothing to lose, and might find yourself speaking a new language.atch, but find none.  Incredible!!!<br /><br />Sixth, Seventh, Eighth...well, you get the idea.  I love Duolingo.  It's a great product and better (in my opinion) than Rosetta Stone.  Since it's free, try it.

B0027MJU00|3.0|I became a huge fan of Gillian Flynn after discovering and reading &#34;Gone Girl&#34; so I went back and sampled some of her earlier work to see what her other books were like. I have to say, I had very high expectations for this book, so perhaps that has tainted my impression of it overall. The positives of this book include unique, well-developed characters; a dark, tangled plot; exemplary descriptions and narrative tone… but aside from the carefully-crafted and sinister story, I just couldn't get behind Libby (the main character) and couldn't get hooked on this book like I did in &#34;Gone Girl.&#34; It wasn't a page-turner for me, despite my appreciation for Gillian's amazing abilities as a story teller. It was good, just not beckoning me every evening to stay up late to finish the next chapter.

I got this for my Brother-in-law who is a photoshop guru but he always buys low-end crappy electronics and he had to admit that a gaming mouse makes his workflow MUCH faster and more efficient. Glad i got it for him. probably deserves 5 stars but we'll see how long it lasts.

However, it's not a great movie and won't likely get any Oscar or Golden Globe nominations although Ashton Kutcher does a surprisingly good job in the title role.<br /><br />This really is more about Apple than it is specifically about Jobs.  It remains interesting for the best part of the film.  But it won't be memorable.  From me, it gets a suggestion rather than a recommendation
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|Doctor Who is a classic.  While the special effects are...BBC (not the greatest), the stories are top notch, the acting is very goos, and the special effects are acceptable.  This isn't your Dad's Dr Who///
0385040253|4.0|This book has pretty much every knot you will ever need.  The way it is organized doesn't make it the easiest to find a new knot.  I like that the book has a historical look with the hand drawings.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I found it a most interesting approach to history/theology challenges.  Used as a book study and was pleased with the discussions it generated.
B0000UJFCO|1.0|Terrible recording. A complete waste of time.....The 'orchestra' is wasted in a sea of sonic garbage and mixed as thin as an old worn out bedsheet....Complete garbage..... Buy YESSONGS instead..............
0345530578|5.0|Great book.  couldn't wait to finish.  enjoyed the paperback as it was easy to read on the plane and in the airport.
B000002J1Y|5.0|This album is truly a masterpiece. I could not even begin to count the number of times I have listened to this one over the last 40 years-on vinyl, 8 track,cassette and CD. Every time I hit play it is like hearing it for the very fist time --again and again. I saw the band live during this tour at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island-it was an experience I will never forget. THIS is the best of the LIVE albums released by the band. Don't waste your time or money on any of the others. An absolutely stunning performance and a pretty good recording for the time.........BUY IT !!!
B005LJETYI|4.0|Good read, interesting twists and turns.  Groundhog Day in the military, if you will.  Interesting watching the protagonist grapple with his predicament, and I didn't have too much trouble suspending my disbelief even on something so outlandish!  Good Job, Mr. Sakurazaka

B000FAGGWQ|1.0|not at  all what i was expecting.  the description wasn't clear, it was kind of misleading.  didn't want this disc, wanted the actual movie!
B00G32OER4|4.0|I was so pleased to see a movie based on Ed and Lorraine Warren. I've seen Lorraine on episodes of Paranormal State, and although I'm sure a lot of the film was embellished for cinematic effect, I was thrilled to see a legitimately scary and well-written film. As a former Catholic, I love films involving exorcisms and demonic possession. Great casting and acting all around. I highly recommend this movie for any horror fan who enjoys a good ghost story, possessions, exorcisms, and scary effects rather than exploitative gore (although I do enjoy a good blood bath).
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was one of those books that needed to be read regardless of meal times and bed times.  I was not prepared for the feel good ending.  IIt was a bit disappointing.
B005LJK3AC|2.0|Didn't care for this one. The &#34;mean bosses'&#34; were overkill. Could have been better. Again, big star names don't necessarily guarantee good entertainment.

B0084IG7KC|1.0|OK, so people seem to be doing movie reviews instead of RATING THE PRODUCT!!!  This DVD would not play in my player for whatever reason and is going back.  This review has nothing to do with the film itself.

147676459X|4.0|It was great, except for one thing. The cover of the book was the kind which you could just take right off, and it was plain white underneath. I know this isn't a fault on your part, but still.
B00ANTNLWM|5.0|Great Movie. Gives you an amazing behind the scenes view of the Cold War and Vietnam from the Defense Secretary (Robert McNamara) at the time. He is brutally honest in his answers.There are Phone calls from JFK and LBJ in this video. Its like being a fly on a wall during one of Americas most tense times. A MUST WATCH for Docs and History buffs.
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|Fast and easy fun. Not a lot of depth, but it doesn't need it, and that would honestly get in the way.<br /><br />The story of the game is you're trying to get your love letter to the princess. A house rule we have is you have to say a line of the love letter if you won the game. Often people quote rap songs, or say things so absurd that we want to play again just to see what other crazy lines we'll say.

B00DJWV11I|5.0|Yeah, I did all of the above.  Numerous times.  At regular intervals.  =)<br /><br />I have not done that with a book in a very long time.  After reading some of the one- and two-star reviews, I had no expectations that I would.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  There are lots of reviews here that will tell you the story.  I won't do that.  But I WILL tell you that this was one of the funniest, sexiest, hottest, smartest stories that I've read in ... forever.  And I'm hard to please.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

B002HHPVHQ|1.0|A mouse's eye view of the collapse of Lehman Brothers -- it may give a fair idea of what was happening on the floor, but does not convey much about what was going on further up in the organization. The book, written by a trader who spent four years at the firm before being laid off before the final blowup, does give a picture of the hyper-testosteroned atmosphere at the firm. But it's all presented in super-personal terms -- it tells a whole lot more about this individual's career and background than I  wanted to know, and tells a whole lot less about the bad choices made by management. There are much, much better books about the crisis (\\"The Big Short\\", and \\"13 Bankers\\" to name two terrific ones) and there are also better books about the firm itself, though none so far have hit the nail on the head, for me at least. Read \\"Short\\" and \\"Bankers\\" to find out what was happening, and see \\"Margin Call\\" to find out how it felt
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is the ultimate in the combining of two things: entertainment and the wasting of time. Defeat boredom, while stretching your patience.
B00139XTG4|5.0|This book discussews the fact that events that are assumed to be very low probability happen more often than markets expect. It repeats many of the arguments in the author's &#34;Fooled by Randomness&#34;, but these arguments should be required reading for any investor, professional or personal
B00992CF6W|3.0|Ok let me start at the beginning. If I remember correctly I got mcpe somewhere between last year. Right now I have version 0.7.6 alpha waiting for 0.8.0. Yet what am I doing? SITTING HERE LIKE AN IDIOT! I am not joking it has been almost 2 months since I last updated my game. Amazon if you are listening to this hurry up and get the update. The only reason I am posting this at one star is because I want others to feel my anguish and rage. And because of this I'm really PISSED. don't get me wrong I like the game it's just really glitch and I'm still  waiting for the update. This is all I'll say.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|A book that's ssooooo easy to hate (particularly if you haven't read it) and so thought-provoking (if you have) certainly bears reading. Since it is a very easy read, with a gripping story line (who will win?), that's no major challenge, and I wish that everybody who damns this book would actually read it. The book is about, as very few will need reminding, the &#34;Chinese Way&#34; of raising children, which seems to be pretty much the opposite of the permissive. endorsing &#34;American Way&#34;. An exaggeration of either method will underline some major problems, and Ms. Chua's book certainly does. But her book also challenges some American orthodoxies that need challenging: for example, every child is a winner, and every child should do what they enjoy doing. Ms. Chua points out that things are not generally fun until you are good at them, and that life is a very competitive sport. There's lots wrong in her child care approach (an issue she goes into herself in the last chapters of the book) but there is also a lot that is constructive.<br /><br />I read this a few years ago, and since then the &#34;The Smartest Kids in the World&#34; has been published.  That focusses on both sides of Ms. Chua's dilemma -- over-demanding Asian standards, and under-rigorous U.S. patterns.  Perhaps Ms. Chua will get a bit more positive attention, as the problems with U.S. education come into focus.

B008478VE8|3.0|I have been aware of this landmark book for many years now.  As a budding biologist I decided I should finally read it.  Darwin uses example after example to make his point, with extensive language around each of his arguments. His only tool of science is observation, and as such he lists a lot of observations.  While fascinating to follow his logic as he drew his conclusions, I found the detail and thoroughness tiring at times.  As such it was difficult for me to read this book in one sitting.  I found I had to read a chapter at a time and then take a break.<br /><br />It was interesting for me to have this window back in time, to see how scientists of years past examined their world and drew their conclusions.  The rigorous science of today uses mathematics and statistics to back up claims.  Darwin just observed, and organized those observations.<br /><br />All in all it was worth a few Saturday afternoons flipping through the pages.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Great fun. amazing graphics. Great story line. What else is there to say about it. But you won't be disappointed when you play this game.
B000GOSVEW|4.0|John Travolta and Hugh Jackman are very good,  plus Holly Berry is always easy on the eyes.  If you liked Broken Arrow, Get Shorty, and Face Off you will enjoy this movie.

B008LXZFH6|1.0|DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.  With all the hype about #2 coming out soon, thought had to watch 1st one to get up to speed.  We only made it about 15 minutes.  Ferrell hasn't made a good movie in years - give it up.
B00GPWEQ70|5.0|I saw this as a Mary Poppins / Saving Mr. Banks double feature, courtesy of Disney's D23.<br /><br />Saving Mr. Banks Movie Review<br />Winds in the east, mist coming in<br />Like something is brewing and about to begin.<br />Can't put my finger on what lies in store<br />But I fear what's to happen, all happened before...<br /><br />Saving Mr. Banks is the story of how Walt got P. L. Travers to give him the rights to Mary Poppins.<br /><br />Pamela Travers (Emma Thompson) is broke, and her agent finally gets her to go see Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), who's been trying to get the rights to Mary Poppins for 20 years. She is loath to give up the rights to Mary, especially to a man who she's convinced will turn her into another Tinkerbell or Mickey Mouse.<br /><br />She is obstinate and quite frankly, a bitch with a bad attitude. Pretty much from the outset, it's pretty clear she isn't going to agree to anything Walt, the boys (B. J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman) or Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) want to do for the movie, making ridiculous demands that she knows won't be met. (At one point, she demands the color red not be allowed in the film.)<br /><br />The story is sort of an odd duck, in that it's set in 1961, but probably a full third of the movie is another storyline in the form of flashbacks to 1906. Those flashbacks are of Travers as a child (Annie Rose Buckley), while she still lived in Australia, and are mostly about the relationship Travers had with her father, Travers Goff (Colin Farrell).<br /><br />At the outset of the movie, the two storylines are seemingly quite divergent, but as the story progresses, it becomes apparent that the reason Travers is so obstinate, why so many things are wrong with what the boys and DaGradi want to do, is because she strongly identifies Mr. Banks with her idolized father, but nobody at Disney understands this, nor the reasons for her seemingly inane demands. Things come to a head when the timelines actually converge, an extremely clever way to make you see why Travers is so against what the Studio wants to do.<br /><br />The turning point comes when Ralph (Paul Giamatti), her driver, the only person she hasn't been able to annoy, connects with her in a way to make her re-think about where she is and the people she's dealing with. (I have to say, this scene could have been trite and contrived, but Giamatti and Thompson are brilliant in it.)<br /><br />Now, I'm really not sure how much of this movie is fact and how much is fudged fact, it is after all, a movie, and doesn't claim to be a historical document. For instance, the way A Spoonful Of Sugar came about is different than how the Sherman's tell the story. Some of it is pretty accurate, like the way Travers complained about everything, since Disney still has the recordings. After one song, Walt remarks, \\"That'll work.\\", his highest praise he ever gave the Sherman Brothers, but it wasn't after Feed the Birds. (It was, however, a nice touch to include Walt's favorite song at his lowest point dealing with Travers.)<br /><br />Regardless, this is a terrific film. Every Walter Elias Disney and/or Mary Poppins fan should see it. Just remember it's not a G-rated film, and probably wouldn't recommend it for kids. (It's PG-13, which for a Disney branded movie is pretty rare. Yes, movies like the Pirates franchise was rated PG-13, but like Saving Mr. Banks, by its very nature should be a Disney Movie.) While the 1961 timeline has some laugh out loud moments, much of the 1906 timeline is pretty dark.<br /><br />Dick Sherman was an active consultant, which is probably one of the reasons why the movie seems so authentic. He is, after all, the last person still living who was in that room during those two weeks, over 50 years ago.<br /><br />I'd also like to address some common misperceptions I've seen, mostly because of the trailer. Don't judge the movie by the trailer. The trailer really doesn't misrepresent, but it hardly touches on a very large aspect of the movie. I understand why it was done that way, but it's very easy to misperceive what the movie is about.<br /><br />First, (and most important) it is not a movie about Walt Disney. Second, it is not Mary Poppins, nor the making of Mary Poppins.<br /><br />It is about Walt attempting to secure the rights to Mary Poppins during Pamela Travers' two-week visit to the Burbank studios in 1961, and the reasons why Pamela Travers is so protective of Mary and Mr. Banks.<br /><br />I also have to say that Hanks might not look a whole lot like Walt, but by the end of the movie he had me convinced he was Walt. After watching his performance, I decided I'd rather have an actor that can act like Walt than an actor that looks like Walt but can't act like Walt, and Hanks does a fantastic and credible job. And let's face it, Emma Thompson doesn't look like Travers, nor do the Sherman Brothers' or Don DaGradi's counterparts. But make the actors look superficially like them, and the performances are so good that you'll buy it. At least I did. (And from interviews, so did Karen Dotrice (who played Jane Banks in the original film) and Dick Sherman, who insist that Hanks' mannerisms and speech are very much like Walt's.)<br /><br />Finally, I would add that if you haven't seen Mary Poppins recently, you might want to boot the DVD (or Blu-Ray, just released), and watch the movie. I'd also watch the segments about the making of the movie in the video \\"the boys, the sherman brothers' story.\\" It's not strictly necessary, but it'll provide some background of a few things that just are in the movie without explanation, and there are some details that might otherwise be missed in Saving Mr. Banks.<br /><br />Anyway, there's a pretty good chance I'll actually go to a theater to see the movie again during its general release to see the other little things I missed. If you know me, that's some high praise...

B001UV4XHY|5.0|What's not to like about the entire series. The kids were terrific actors. Never got the recognition that they deserved. Of course, it was all based on the wonderful novel by J. K. Rowling
B0084BMUFA|4.0|I liked this book because it reminded me of what makes christmas great. I am sure everyone knows someone like Scrooge who hates the excessive cheerfulness of the season. If it is possible to change a person's attitude then it is well worth it because once he learns from th e past present and future ghosts of christmas he is able to turn his attitude around and start enjoying christmas. Won't give too Much away but everyone should read this classic during th e holiday season to \\"get in the mood\\".
B001OQCV6A|3.0|I love Jude Law. The movie was a disappointment, because of all the antics. It would have been fine without them.
B00GNIOJNC|5.0|An amazing third album for this young band~you can hear them growing up and changing with each one. I love the heavy guitar influence in this album and the lack of electronic filler noise that was so prevalent in their earlier albums; especially Up All Night. Don't get me wrong! I loved those first albums. Take Me Home may always be my favorite but Midnight Memories is a definite contender. With catchy melodies and heartfelt lyrics you can't help but close your eyes and just listen. My favorites on this album are &#34;Through The Dark&#34;, &#34;Better Than Words&#34;, &#34;Something Great&#34;, and &#34;Strong&#34;, with &#34;Happily&#34; right up there as well. It's hard to choose because they are all so good and so different. I love the rock influence of &#34;Midnight Memories&#34;, and the humble honesty of &#34;Don't Forget Where You Belong&#34;. The fact that the boys were so heavily involved in the song writing on this album makes it all the more amazing and worth owning. Even if you don't consider yourself a One Direction Fan; you will love this album.

The disc arrives in perfect shape, the box is not damaged or anything - however the dvd seems to have issue when playing in multiple players.  I don't know if there are defects in the DVDs that Amazon orders from or what but I am very unsatisfied.  I was really looking forward to watching this movie - the WHOLE movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I am not the most competent user, so I demand ease of use. The Weather Channel app is very easy to use. Add to that it's truly useful functionality and you end up with a winner.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was very difficult to read, but I couldn't stop.  The words kept pulling me forward. It is a reminder of the lives that are truly changed by the events and people around them. And we can never forget the true horror of war.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Ana and Christian continue in this second book of the series.  Many of my favorite scenes from the trilogy are in this book so I enjoyed reading it a second time.  The book is action packed for such a short time line and would have been fine with a few less sex scenes but I still enjoyed re-reading the story.  E L James is awesome at creating a vivid picture.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|AC/DC ROCKS thru Amazon online purchasing !
B00G70JQZC|3.0|Wolverine, has his ability taken away too easily. His knives are lost at the end of the movie. Not sure why he goes to Japan. I won't be in a hurry to watch the next Wolverine, if their is one.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I LOVE this book!! I'm so glad Jamie McGuire wrote a book from Travis's POV. These books just replaced my favorite book!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the best puzzle type game since Riven.  It allows you to  use your brain, inventiveness, curiosity, and<br />imagination all at the same  time  while being entertained.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I have always loved Columbo, and now I have the complete set of all his movies--they are absolutely GREAT!  Always so much fun watching Columbo solving the mystery in his quiet, easy-going manner.  I never tire of watching these.
B00EJYGQFG|4.0|Very Impressive as an artist an as a Musician with her being able to keep up with the subtle changes in the demand of POP an that wasn't a clever saying I honestly mean it by listening to the album while being aware of the direction of Music in general while hip-hop is sounding more like Pop-Hop with Kanye; Jay-z; Drake while also including the Cashmoney Posse her Voice syncs well with the lyrics(catchy pop tunes) make her a competition to fret the only reason I didn't give her a full rack of stars is only because it sounds like there's something missing from making this a album of the decade but then again I'm not a die hard fan of Pop Music
B00004YW6I|4.0|Great album.  Lots of good songs on this one. Definitely can distinguish her sound in this album, from others. She rarely sounds the same.
0307454541|5.0|Thrilling book in trilogy. Entire trilogy worth reading. Could not put the book down. Buy it if you want a good read.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|This  game is so awesome. The graphics are amazing. The back story is incredible also. I would definitely recommend this to everyone who loves mysterious games.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I bought it for my grandson and he love it. It is a funny game, that  develops the imagination of the kids I think .
B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|Don't let all the negative reviews scare you off.  Considering that Boston set the bar so high with their first few albums, people are always expecting similar stuff in each new album and are quick to point out that it's another album not entirely like the first two.  Tom Scholz has stated that while he enjoys adding some classic sounding tracks, he also enjoys trying new things as well.  While I agree that it would be nice if he did release another album that sounded exactly like their 70s music, their new sound is actually pretty good too, just different.  A co-worker was so excited about the new Britney Spears album and she was listening to that in the cube next to me all week and when you compare this album to that garbage, the difference is night and day.  So my point is that if you are a Boston fan, or rock fan in general, this is a pretty decent album when all things are considered and definitely worth a listen.  Even if just for the guitars alone :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|V Very fun game and easy to learn.  Like how the game is set up bjjjjjjycgcvjvj big. Hubby ugh huff high hi I g dig fun fun desk funk stuck idyll

B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Cracker Songs - like most of them. One of Blake's best for my money. Worth the investment folks. You will enjoy it.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|This was a gift to someone and the recipient never told me what they thought of it. I have seen the movie and loved it.
B008476HBM|1.0|I know this is a classic; that's why I tried it but I couldn't get through it.  The language was too tough for me!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|\\"Allegiant\\" is the third and final novel in Veronica Roth's \\"Divergent\\" trilogy. The series is set in the near future, taking place in a dystopian society that is governed by \\"factions.\\" These five factions are Abnegation, Amity, Dauntless, Candor, and Erudite. Each faction favors a different set of values, and when a person reaches the age of 16 they are able to choose among the five factions. They call this the \\"Choosing Ceremony\\" and it is at this time in Beatrice Prior's life that we are introduced to her in the novel \\"Divergent.\\"<br />I loved \\"Divergent.\\" I thought it was an excellent novel with plenty of action, a good amount of romance, and an intriguing mystery that kept me turning the pages. I went through the same things as I read through the second novel, \\"Insurgent.\\" \\"Allegiant,\\" however, was a different story altogether. It seemed to me as if Roth just wanted to finish the series as quickly as possible. We discover the big reason of why the world is the way it is only 100 pages into the book, which was kind of a let down for me. The romance between Tris and Tobias is way overdone, I found myself skimming through a lot of the dialogue between them. Towards the middle of the novel it slows down as Tris begins to discover more about the mystery surrounding her family. The end of the book was anticlimactic in my opinion, and I believe it could have been done a little better. Roth had a lot of potential to take \\"Allegiant\\" in a different direction, and I'm sad that she didn't. Overall the book wasn't what I expected, but I still enjoyed it. If you enjoyed the first two books I'm sure you'll enjoy this one, but be prepared for drawn-out romance, a few let downs, but an overall enjoyable book.
B000VI12ZS|4.0|acting good but structure and script uneven. Many redundant scenes and it took too long to get to the point.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Sharks eating people.  Perfect.<br /><br />I believe I was actually making chomping noises outloud when I first started making the shark swim around.  If you don't like sharks, or want to be one, don't play this game.<br /><br />I was actually happy to see there were swimmers, and paragliders, and other sharks to eat, and endangered wildlife like sea turtles.<br /><br />These are normal thoughts if you are a hungry shark.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Exactly what I expected...first class!!  Because my Kindle Fire has almost replaced my computer at my desk, I literally wore out my last cable. The longer length is great. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B00GX50BD2|5.0|Ashton nailed it!  We all know how the story ends...  Thank you Steve Jobs for fitting a pc in your pocket.
0738212415|5.0|Want to learn how to draw?  This is your book!  Mark Kistler, by far, has the best books for the beginning artist.  This is the best of all of them!  Mr. Kistler takes you through one easy lesson a day.  Each lesson is filled with examples and excellent guidence and encouragement.  There are also student examples so you can see actual progress some people have made with this book.  I've been drawing for a long time and have a ton of books and I still consult this one from time to time because it's that good!  It's great for kids or adults.  Even if you know how to draw, you'll find useful ideas in this book.  It's one of my fave drawing books and I highly recommend it!
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Wow, this is really a very scary view of what this world could be like in twenty or so years. Just so much information flying around on the WWW, and who really wants to know all that stuff anyway. Now the airlines want to allow cellphone use over 10,000 feet and even as i write this review I feel like I'm adding to the noise.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I really liked this book; I like that he is re-visiting a character from a former book. It kept my attention and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  A good book to curl up with on a cold winter's day with a cup of tea!
B004AM5QT4|2.0|After reading a lot of his other  stuff, this was not very suspenseful and low on character development, almost juvenile.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I held back a star because with it's addictive powers it should provide assistance to get my housework/cooking, etc. done. LOL
B0062NAVXA|5.0|If you want a movie with good morals and message this is a good one.  I would buy it again.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I am a Stephen King fan , but I was disappointed in this sequel,  although THE SHINING  is a hard act to follow.  I liked knowing what had happened to Dan all these yers later and that he had worked through some of his &#34;problems&#34;  caused by his traumatic childhood.  The young girl was appealing and the connection between those two was real, believable and  somewhat endearing.  I was expecting to be scared more, and I especially thought that the True Knot would actually capture the girl (Abby,  can't remember ?) and that's where the suspense would escalate as it had with the one part about their torture of the &#34;basebal boy&#34; ,  but that never happened.  The ending seemed too easy to me.... not the &#34;battle&#34; that I expected, although I was relieved that it turned out as it did.  Perhaps my expectations were too high,  but to me,  this was not vintage King.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The story line is really fabulous but the pornography I could do without.  She seems to be an ok writer (and funny too) but REALLY likes sex or is missing it in her own life because she describes sex scenes that don't even lend themselves to the story.  But I will give her this.... sex sells, so she's clearly not dumb.
B007WFQZF0|3.0|I used to really like this CD, but I was listening to it when my girlfriend broke up with me. I was so upset, it made me throw up. So now I kind of hate it, but not as much as I hate that cheating Ashleigh!!!!!!
B0076NKNLA|5.0|I am SOOOO not a fan of Michelle Williams but that being said, I think she was the perfect choice to be cast for this movie.  She really did nail the part.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read it in one day. What a good story. Loved the originality. haven't seen the movie but am anxious to do so.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. What a great read.  Sky has issues and she doesn't even know it, more like repressed memories.  Dean is looking for his lost best friend after the death of his twin sister.  This is the story of lies, deception and loss.  But, even greater it is a story of Love and finding strength and never losing Hope.  TERRIFIC READ.
B002KJX4IE|4.0|I enjoyed this old film as much as I did the first time I saw it. Not horrifying by today's standards, except for the very young, it has an innocent quality which is charming.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|It was a good game for one evening. No replay value and a lot of back traveling.  Expensive.  Made too easy by looking at map for area that has exclamation mark.
B003U4UNPK|4.0|A little slower that the first two seasons.....but still great series!  Getting close to being ready for Season 4 of LOST!
B002ZG98C8|2.0|Really disapointed after seeing the previews. Really slow and predicable, not exciting as portrayed. A B-movie for the drive-in. Not worth the time or money for me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it better than the first. I hope that the last one is even better. Though I did hear mixed thoughts about it. Anyway good book!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great for my grandson to teach me to play chess, without his creative definition of the rules.  He's a beginner but loves to play.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Very wonderful and moving story of young men during the war and the struggle with drugs back in the early days.
B00G70WLJA|5.0|I don't enjoy going to theaters anymore for adventure movies but did enjoy this one on our home television.  Love Hugh Jackman's character!
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Good Movie! I love Denzel Washington. Acoholism is such a struggle and this movie shows how hard it is for the &#34;normal&#34; person to deal with admitting addiction.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I loved this movie! Heavily inspired by anime and Japanese monster movies, if youre a fan of both, I think youll like the movie too. Its full of action, and awesome effects. Story has some huge plot holes, but youre not here for story, if you want that go see something serious. This is purely a fun movie without the heavy cheese that Transformers had.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Great action packed movie. The actors were also funny and I liked some of the humor they injected during the fighting.
0143124838|2.0|So I bought this book on a whim, as I was headed out for a flight for business travel and like to decompress and read fashion focused books, blogs and magazines. The packaging sold me and &#34;It&#34; is on so many blog wish gift lists. Wow what a disappointment. Love Alexa, but this book was all over the place, random pics, no caption or random tie ins to the text. Example, was reading about her stylish grandfather expecting to turn the page and see him, but low and behold just nude shots. No issue with random nudes but made no sense?! This book reads like random thoughts and pictures tucked into a notebook, no unifying story. Read the book in an hour and it just felt awkward, no real fashion tips, insider where to score cool pieces or insight into a cohesive story of who she is...so disappointed. Pretty pink for your vanity, don't expect to be wowed.
0307887448|5.0|This was a spectacular book that I really connected with and could not put down. Once I picked it up I didn't put it down until I finished it three hours later. Considering I'm an avid geek gamer raised in the 80's I was probably the prime demographic for this and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Cline did a magnificent job creating a brand new immersive world with obvious connections to the the real world that we live in. Set in a dystopian future where fossil fuels have been tapped out and energy is a rare resource, the populous at large now find themselves relying on the OASIS, an MMORPG on steroids made available for free by it's co-creators James Halliday and Ogden Morrow. The iconic Halliday, a Steve Jobs analogue, upon his death has left an Easter Egg within his enormous game and declared that whomever discovers it will inherit his vast fortune as well as control of his company Gregarious Simulation Systems.<br /><br />Halliday, a product of the 1980's has left riddles and challenges littered with references to that era's music, gaming, movies, etc. so anyone who remembers that time will thoroughly enjoy the adventure.<br /><br />Highly recommended and I wish that it never ended.
B004WO57E4|1.0|Heroes 3 play is a nightmare. You have to constantly keep saving your game because it just locks up spontaneously & you have to just reboot. Around the tenth time it happened I was weighing the pros & cons of setting myself on fire. Didn't matter if I installed it on an older PC or my hardcore gaming rig. I've already got it replaced from the original manufacturer (not Ubisoft)
0425252868|5.0|Fantastic Book!!!!! Clearly shows how two enemies sent to kill each other can extend ultimate respect for one another.  Highly recommend this book!!
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|This movie depicting \\"swinging\\" London during the 1960s is probably the last Hollywood drama worth seeing.  It was made in 1966 and portrayed an emerging hedonistic counterculture in the Western world.  The plot is largely irrelevant except to show this trend.<br /><br />The people who were attracted by this film were mostly young people stuck in highly structured schools or jobs wanting to be part of this movement.  They were in the dying Protestant work-ethic era but wanted to be part the new hedonistic era.<br /><br />Here they saw a freelance photographer driving around London looking for adventures to film.  He could do whatever he wanted when he wanted.  He was always involved with beautiful models and the latest cultural trends.  This was probably one of the first films to feature people like photographers, models, and rock bands as celebrities.<br /><br />At this time people were so mesmerized by the new rock bands that they would stand silently watching them at a concert.  Here we also see the emerging self-centered egotistical rock band performers that we know so well today.<br /><br />There are some sex scenes in this movie that were controversial at the time but very tame by today's standards.  The movie has a surrealistic ending which I think it can do without.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|A great display of American Exceptionalism.  We're so snotty about our superiority that we refuse to learn how to care for our people.  It's sad when the dirty commies in Cuba get better health care than we do.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is an odd film about odd characters and has now apparently achieved a cult status.  It's been years since I've seen it but the basis is the following.<br /><br />Dynamite is the nerdy main character and his main connection to the American mainstream is attending high school in rural Idaho.  He is surrounded by odd characters who are always trying some trick to get ahead, everything except hard work or study.  Eventually Dynamite runs into the second main character in high school, who could be an illegal alien from Mexico but the movie never identifies his status.<br /><br />The movie ends up being a version of the traditional American high school saga where outsiders like Dynamite and his Mexican friend confront insiders like the head cheerleader or the football team captain.  The ending is predictable but the movie is memorable because of its oddity.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is my first Amazon review, but this book is completely worth it! I could barely put the book down to sleep. I loved the character developments on all sides. There were some moments that I was cheering for the &#34;bad&#34; guys, because I completely understood their reasoning. Howey really puts you in the moment, like I felt I was running up and down the stairs of the silo with Juliette.<br /><br />I bought this book because the reviews said it was amazing, so I wanted to confirm that yes, this book is beyond fantastic! If you want a good read that's not frivolous crap, then you should definitely check this book out! Even if you're not into the whole post-apocalyptic world genre, this is such a well-written story with strong female characters, I guarantee you will enjoy it!
B005I4JG80|5.0|A must read if you have children. I'm so intrigued by the way French women raise their children. I can't say I agree with all of it, but I respect it. This author really took her time with compiling her info on this book, you can tell, and she did a wonderful job at it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great. Free and intuitive to use. No more need for wake up calls when traveling. What more do ya want?
B00FY2UJAU|4.0|Very good movie.  Lots of action as expected, and very good plot line.  If you love street racing, get the bad guy movies you should see this one.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|This app is pretty fun, and it's cool unlocking stuff in the console version just by playing this version.<br /><br />-H

B000I5SY9Q|5.0|37 Years After This Film's Release, Some Of Us Are STILL:  &#34;Mad As Hell and Not Going To Take This Anymore!&#34;  It's  quite amazing to me that even after so much time has passed, there are still some motion pictures out there that can really leave a lasting impression or have a powerful & lasting impact on their audiences even to this very day.  Peter Finch's performance is outstanding in the role of burnt--out & washed--up TV News anchorman Howard Beale, on the fictitious &#34;UBS News Network,&#34; who FINALLY has enough guts to go out live, over the public airwaves, and tell his viewers and listeners the TRUTH about the way things REALLY work in our world, as well as in network TV broadcasting.  Even though the consequences of Howard Beale's actions land him in a TON of trouble with everyone else around him, especially at the end of the film, I still truly admire his courage and the stand that he takes against the ruling elites, principalities & powers of darkness (pay VERY close attention to Ned Beatty's character and HIS behavior in the film) that are the REAL driving forces at work behind the scenes & that truly govern the way things REALLY work, as opposed to how we were TOLD that they worked.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Good book strange ending curious to know what happens next. Hmmmm 9 words ummm that's all I can say about it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I read this book a year or so ago, and I enjoyed it mostly as a \\"think\\" novel. I reread it because those lovely folks at O.B.O.B. central finally chose a decent book. it been a long time coming, let me tell you. anyway, this second read through was less enjoyable, perhaps because being required to do something instantly saps the fun from the activity. still, green never fails to make me laugh, and as a fan of his crash course videos, it is enlightening to see his views on something deeper than who won the War of 1812 (spoiler alert: no one). In short, a good book although the concepts need a little googleing. think of this as a brain exercise.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|Gov't Mule...what can I say.  Do they EVER make bad music?  I think not and Shout is no different.  Love, love, love the funky sounds of the first two songs.  Warren Haynes is one incredible singer/songwriter/guitar slinger and if you've never seen them live...it's your loss.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. We recently played with four players aged 59, 33, 13, and 5. It was a blast!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a really good book and it had a lot of action<br /><br />I am looking forward to read the next book
B00AQA0OJG|5.0|Getting this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend, and I think he's going to love it.  There's a bootleg of this out there, but the one I got from Amazon is the real deal.  If you want to know what the counterfeit looks like, here's the link: [...]  One really easy way to tell if you've gotten a counterfeit version of this figure is to note whether there's a clean white line on her skirt.  The counterfeit version doesn't have the line at all.<br /><br />Other than that, her pose is cute and I love her adorable smile.  It really reminds you of the character's personality.  She has a kind face.  Nice details and cool stand to put her on.  I recommend this figure.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Rewrite PLEASE, Veronica!  The first two books were so awesome. The plot development, character development, and ultimately the story resolution just fell apart. It felt like either you ran out of steam writing the series or someone else took over writing for you. Please consider starting 'Allegiant' completely over with a new premise, plot, and outcome for the characters. Your fans would greatly appreciate it!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|This was a good read. Unfortunately for this book the first book ( A Time To Kill ) was so good that this book didn't come close.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think the game is so cool I really like it alright it is so much fun to play on
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|The best app ever! This app is really easy to use and gives you guidance on what everything is. If you are wondering what something is then there's a FAQ button and you kill running apps to boost your memory! I have already cleared out a total of 1.3 GB after two weeks of owning this! I didn't. know that my Kindle was being thrashed by so many residual and cache files. I check it every day. GET THIS APP!
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Great find as the FAOD. Controls are simple, accelerate, brake, boost, air trick. Seems to have great replay value. Realistic settings and graphics. Definitely worth a download.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Pretty good game, I feel like there's plenty of energy for the activities, and its easy enough to pick up.
B00ERIUO02|4.0|good katy perry cd though I did like teenage dream better  - this one isn't as &#34;fun&#34; but it's still worth the price of the cd and shes growing as an artist so that's cool...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Full of entertainment for hours of fun! It is loaded with interesting levels and fun mini games. I didn't think that it would have been fun to play but it is. I will definitely recommend this to friends.

B002WY64HA|5.0|awesome group and getting the album so soon was great, the sound is crisp and clear, love it on vinyl
B0084670FU|4.0|it's a fine movie and well played. it's a story about guns and how they dehumanize and distort. it's also about the very wide spectrum of human experience, and the similarities of each to the other.<br /><br />pitt holds his own; blanchette - always great.
B006OAB432|5.0|great group, in years to come this will bev remembered as one of the classics with every song a winner

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a really fun game to play. The graphics are really good and I really enjoy playing this game every day.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This is a wonderful book reflecting the good and bad of Life and raising children during the early 1900,s  Easy read and should be required reading in the public schools today!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Its so fun but also demented, u are a shark and u eat fish, people, and pretty much everything, its soooo fun.
B00GX598FO|5.0|Great to see the entire cast return plus a few new additions.  If you liked the first movie, the sequel is another fun ride.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it's great for all animal lovers. You take care of a horse  if you never got one  download this app it's great
B00EPFEY44|4.0|The music and video were spectacular but the liner notes were wholly incomplete. It's very useful for my mom to have the words of the songs, especially since most of them are in foreign languages.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A curious mystery, but an enthralling tale and worth the reading.  She deals with very serious matters in a &#34;most unusual way&#34;.  I think that I agree with her.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|My only complaint is this. Kids are impatient, game makes know this. So, what do they do? Want to keep playing right now? Buy more credits, buy this update, get this armour, buy that missile. Don't wait and earn points by playing. Get it now! God it makes me mad. But, it's nice that the game is free why pay one when you can pay over and over again. If you have kids password protect in app purchases.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game get it<br />You really should really get it u will love it its My favorite game it really is the best game ever.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This is Awesome for the Kindle Fire HD, I have been looking at all the free games and this on is addicting.

B008KOTNVA|5.0|A must for any DIY person. Fits every electronic thinga majig in my house. I love the ability to use the extension as a T handle.
B004PKOKSO|5.0|Splendid performances by all. Sco does more to interpret a ballad expressively than any guitarist alive, and his tune selection here is awesome. An extra plus: My wife doesn't mind this album, because it's inside playing and quiet. Colley is wonderful on bass, too, and the keyboard solos are just beautiful and tasteful.
B009LDD5HW|5.0|such an awesome series altho it has gone downhill since cory monteiths death (RIP) still a great series for anyone of any age!
B00H2UFHBI|5.0|I purchased these books for my teen-aged granddaughter.  She is very interested in science and mysteries, but she is a reluctant reader and it is hard to find books for her.  She loved the first book, Outview, and asked me to find the rest of the series for her before she had even finished it.  She couldn't put these books down!  She related to the characters and their relationships.  The twists and turns in the story held her interest.  She enjoyed telling me what was happening as the story progressed.  I would recommend this trilogy for any teen reader on your shopping list.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can't put this game down... need more bananas. Hours of fun and great waste of the day before you know it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest, this app works perfectly on my kindle. To pin from a website that doesn't have a pin it button, hold your finger on the web address and then select share.
B009DT424Y|4.0|This is a nice unit and works well if you are only going to connect it to your lapel and speak.  Nolan has a newer model that is only a few dollars more which is more powerful and flexible - well worth the extra.  The people at Nolan are fantastic!  They are right there to help and will go more than the extra mile to make sure you are well cared for.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game!!! My kids And I both really enjoy it. It's very addicting some of the level ups are quite challenging to get completed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Way better than subway surfers has a lot more interactive play going on. I love it great boards and graphics too
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I'm uninstalling this game because it annoyingly begs for money. Also once you reach level 35  our disabled itself unless you pay or SPAM a bunch of people on Facebook.
B008Q0AJA2|2.0|It was OK.  Not as compelling as I remembered the first time I saw it.  Interesting concept but not earth shattering.
B004I744AS|3.0|Haven't really used this one, so can't say alot about it at this point.  But am not saying it is bad either....
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Simply fantastic. I have never been into this erotica type of story until now. I can not wait to read more!
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Good game, love the hidden object games and this is a good one... I have really enjoyed this game alot
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Fearless is the best novel I have read to date. The life of Adam Brown is truly inspiring, so inspiring that this book can easily be read in one sitting if you have the available time. Adam Brown is a true American Hero who deserves so much more recognition. This book is for all (mature) audiences, anyone intereted in the military (specifically the Navy SEAL Teams and DEVGRU), religion (Christianity), overcoming difficulties in life, and being of excellent moral character.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Really enjoying this, especially since I've already been playing for several hours and haven't needed to pay anything. Nice variation on the typical hidden object game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicted. P l a y this game every chance I get! In bed, the  bathroom, t h e hair salon, th e doctors office. Wherever I can!
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|Champions of metal for over three decades, Saxon have again released an album that further cements their reputation for consistency not only in terms of regular album releases, but also in terms of the quality of music they record.  Although they have gone through some line-up changes over the years, original members Biff Byford and Paul Quinn have kept the band on the right path from the beginning and this album is no exception.  The current line-up has been together since the mid 90’s now and as such has formed a tight night group over the many years on the road and in the studio since then, and it shows.<br />Sacrifice follows on from where 2011’s Call To Arms left off in that it is more of a straight forward heavy metal album with a sound leaning more towards that of their albums of the 1980’s than those of the 2000’s.  We do get an album intro again this time around which sounds like native music from a primitive Central or South American tribe and sets the scene nicely for the title song to open the album.  With a good blend of aggressiveness and melody this song is one of my faves.  Made In Belfast is good too with it’s acoustic guitars mixed in, great bass and driving rhythm, and is a tilt of the hat to the working class man which is repeated again later with Walking The Steel.  This respect and appreciation for the legacy of generations past, whether in their hard work in nation building industries or in exploits on the battlefield has also been a consistent theme in Saxon’s songs over the decades and has helped to maintain their link and popularity with the common man.  Of the two songs though, Made In Belfast is better than Walking The Steel in my opinion.<br /><br />Previously with songs like Backs To The Wall and Never Surrender Saxon have told us to hang in there, tough it out, stand your ground and fight back, to refuse to submit, be down trodden, put down or defeated.  That Saxon theme shines through again in Stand Up And Fight which is another song I quite like.  Driving cars and riding motor cycles is another theme which has been present over the years right from their very first albums in songs such as Stallions Of The Highway and Motorcycle Man, and this album is no exception with Warriors Of The Road.  A straight forward, faster paced rocker about Formula 1 racing (hear the commentary announcing the arrival of Ayrton Senna in the pre-guitar solo bit).  I quite like this one too.<br />A song that won’t win the Nobel prize for literature for its lyrics is Night Of The Wolf, a rather simple warning to beware werewolves (that’s if you ever go “far beyond the forest in a land of ice and snow” wherever that may be?), but I can’t help but like the melody of this one.  However, my favorite song of the whole album though is Guardians Of The Tomb which I think showcases Saxon at their best.  Biff is a master of writing lyrics that tell stories from history and this is another great example but it also has the perfect blend of aggressive riffs, melodic guitar solos, a couple of change-ups in pace, and a melodic chorus the likes of which has brought me much listening pleasure in Saxon songs for many, many years and is why I like this band so much.<br /><br />On the down side there are a couple of songs which although aren’t terrible by any means, don’t really do much for me, those being Walking The Steel and Standing In A Queue.  The latter is ok musically but pretty boring lyrically.  I’m usually not too fussed by lyrics unless they’re pretty bad, but I just find this tale (no doubt based on personal experience) a bit boring to listen to, even if I can relate to it.  I haven’t mentioned Wheels Of Terror, so note that while it isn’t a favourite it isn’t too bad with some cool guitar riffing in it.<br /><br />For some unknown reason Saxon decided that they would only release one song from the album in digital format which is quite irritating, especially when I shelled out the extra dosh to get the digi-pack book version (and very nice too I might add) with a bonus 5 track CD.  So I had to buy it on iTunes, but I think I deserved to get that extra track on the CD thanks very much Saxon!  Called Luck Of The Draw it’s not a bad song, a straight forward rocker that fits in well with the rest of the album and is far better to finish with than Standing In A Queue.<br /><br />The bonus disc has a couple of re-recorded songs in Forever Free and Just Let Me Rock, an orchestrated version of Crusader and acoustic versions of Requeim (the original is one of my all time Saxon faves) and Frozen Rainbow.  I like these acoustic songs the best, and it’s a good bonus disc which makes for a great package over all.<br /><br />To sum up Saxon’s latest, I like it better than most of their albums of the 2000’s, but just a little less than 2011’s Call To Arms.  However they’re one of my favourite bands and they are always consistent.<br /><br />Favourite Tracks:<br />Guardians Of The Tomb, Warriors Of The Road, Stand Up And Fight, Night Of The Wolf, Sacrificeosh to get the digi-pack book version (and very nice too I might add) with a bonus 5 track CD.

B006TZBGBW|5.0|got it at a reduced price and had all the albums. could not beat the deal., great deal, reduced price
B0016K40KY|5.0|Lawrence of Arabia is a great old movie that can be watched several time and still be very interesting .
157421327X|1.0|I normally read the reviews...Didn't on this one, wish I had.  This.book has very few pages.  Some designs are shown with others so you really have to look to see how each separate design is made.  Very much a waste of dollars.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just opened it and watching a movie and it is perfect I love the Google chromecast and also it is sold at a perfect price
B00BKTFABE|1.0|Not Kindle's fault.  Since the camera is built for Skype you can not, easily, frame your picture. Kind of a contortionist routine to aim while looking around the device at the picture.  If your subject is moving forget it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Awesome game must get it if you like diablo. I like how it free flowing and easy to use. Can accidently buy stuff but that is nothing major.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|This is another movie that I can't believe got by me in the theaters and rental arenas. If you enjoyed part one, you are in for another thrill ride. There doesn't seem to be any giant gaps between Part one and Part two. The Producer and Director really stayed true to the theme of the storyline. I easily enjoyed this movie as much as Part one. Again, this series is not for children because of the amount of violence.
B002OCFZR0|5.0|After watching Jeremy Brett in the British version of these stories, was so happy to read them.  The stories and the television version match beautifully.  Nice to get some of the introductory comments by Dr. Watson to the different vignettes.  Gives a fuller picture of this character.  Delightful to read over and over.
1608838137|5.0|I enjoy Downton Abbey, but it doesn't fit into my work schedule. I have all three seasons now on DVD and enjoy them. The DVDs were perfect for getting caught up--and without commercials. I watched the entire season in a few viewings. I plan to get Season 4 on DVD as well. All discs came without any flaws.
B0050X1OQ6|4.0|Installed a pair of these (replacing the OE stick - I like things to match!) - in my Synology DS1513+. Works great.
B000FC1K66|5.0|I loved this book , has history love betrayal and much more it's very infesting to read and keeps you wondering about what else happened ..
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|This is an excellent album, these guys worked hard to make a great number of very good songs. Rock this loud and hard!
B008TRH5N6|5.0|It brings the original book to life with its simple, streamlined editing style. I have the original hardcover from 1963, and every word is there. I have read this book too many times to count and the kindle version is good, fast yet deep reading, still.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Just like the real thing! Beware, though, some games can last a long time. I'm glad you can't play it all day (unless you spend real money) otherwise I'd never get anything done.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|While Book 3 in the trilogy was as entertaining as the others in the Trilogy, its only weakness was the romance that further developed between Four/Tobias and Beatrice/Tris.  Rather than enhancing the story it was more of a distraction.  Realizing that these books were written for the teenage group, these parts of the books rang untrue, almost like it belonged in a novel about 1950's teens and not about teens who are separated from parents to be trained to serve the community in their respective factions.  When the factions are in jeopardy and certain individuals including Tris and Tobias are in survival mode their relationship plays more like  Frankie Avalon/Annette Funicello movie from the early 1960's than how actual teens, even today, would respond.  But, the conflicts and action as the characters in the book(s) respond to threats they face from all sides kept me turning the page to find out what happens to our hero and heroine, as well as their companions, next.  It's a wild ride and entertaining from page 1of Book 1 thorough the final page of Book 3.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|So funny, loved the dry humor and this unexpected relationship.  If you like the Royal  Tenrnbaums you will love this...
1455519006|5.0|Baldacci is always, always exciting to read.  He never fails to grab my attention and interest.  This book is no exception.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The story was written for a preteen audience. The story itself had (has) a lot of potential.  I just wish it were presented in a more adult perspective
B001P06GX4|5.0|Great game for the family.  It requires quick spatial reasoning skills and some strategy, and it's a lot of fun to boot.  Plus, I love the transparent color pieces (maybe because they look like little pieces of Jell-O, yum).
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Love this read. Waiting for a sequel. If you enjoy a conversation its the book for you. Excellent read right here.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps you on your toes ... no other words but really good...I couldn't get my eyes off of it!  Awesome
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|This is an arcade type golf game. It lets you control the ball in the air. The graphics are also quite impressive.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Been waiting to be able to play DotP for awhile now, and I'm not disappointed!  I don't have any complaints at all.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|Tim Burton and Johnny Depp together never fail to deliver…  End of the story !!! They always work great together.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Downtown Abbey is a wonderful story to watch on DVD Thank you for offering it for sale at a decent price
B0093SSYR6|3.0|All of the main characters in this film were so self absorbed it was hard to feel any empathy for them. I sat through the whole film just to see what would happen and the ending was disappointing. It seemed like the character played by Michelle Williams was being punished for making the choice to take a risk by leaving her physically available but emotionally distant husband, where I wanted to see her rewarded all around for taking that chance.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downtown Abbey A wonderful DVD to view . Thanks for offering it for sale. The family enjoyrd watching it .
B00AGE5P0U|1.0|so implausable what was the point of making this garbage. Acting ,directing ,script was all b movie level. Don't bother watching.
B0081HLMD8|5.0|A wicked rush , the pace is unrelenting. The plot sometimes doesn't keep with the pace but it ties neatly.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|First, let me say that I am from a time, that music had more meaning, at least in my eyes. I am a huge fan of bands, like Jane's Addiction, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden. Over time, I have become much more eclectic, and realized the power of music past, adding the likes of the Rolling Stones, Queen, Elton John, and the &#34;Man In Black&#34;, to name a few. Also, Dave Mathews, and for those who are not familiar, almost all of Blue October, have been great story tellers, for my generation.<br /><br />I have been bothered by the lack of depth, in the last decade or so. So much bubble-gum pop, (C)rap, with lyrics that defy humanity, and only focus on the using of other people, for both pain, and pleasure.<br /><br />I was not a big fan of Katy Perry, and I thought that, not so much her fault, the audience that she catered too, was far too young, for the explicit lyrics, she spewed out. Stupid parents, bringing their children to concerts, so they could learn about endless drinking, three-somes, and other events, that were never meant for children. Yet they came in droves, dressed like Katy, and waited hours to get a glimpse of her. She was NO ROLE MODEL.<br /><br />This album is different, much more grown up, and much more pleasing to the ears. The beginning is just ok. Roar, is certainly catchy, and deserved to be the top song on the album, and one I believe is intended for her original fans. The next few songs, are just ok, you can listen to them, and not feel the need to skip ahead. Not very challenging, lots of verse (insert short lyric) verse. Some of which, is still not intended for children.<br /><br />The album progresses at a nice pace, getting closer to the person that Katy has become, over the years of stardom meets heartbreak. She tells tales, that I am certain, are very very personal. She has finally become a woman, not just some eclectic girl, with light bulbs on her skimmpy swimsuit.<br /><br />This album, may be a bridge, that carries her old fans (really young actually), over to the more worldly, wiser, mature singer, that she is today. I am happy to add this to my collection of music, and enjoyed the raw honesty, that only pain can bring.<br /><br />This is a new Katy Perry, better, stronger, smarter, and dare I say, classier, than ever before. I hope she continues this new direction, she is a far more interesting artist now, than she ever was, in her teenage dream, living in a bubble, days before.young actually), over to the more worldly, wiser, mature singer, that she is today.

B00G1YAD42|5.0|ITs Excellent and serves my purpose very well. I will be travelling to  quite a few places in the next few weeks. and thisis just what I need
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I prefer Kindle and this app is a goto icon! Different pictures (I think) for different device platforms.. the IPad pic. is different, etc. Goes right to the app without any glitches.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I used to be in a writing class a long time ago.I got this just to try since it was free.<br />I have been using it daily to keep track of ideas that I think of through out the day.I am ready to start writing practices again .
0810989956|5.0|This took me a while before I could write an accurate review because I purchased this as a gift for my nephew. He's a fan of all the books so took a chance with this...  he writes in it, draws and reads. He has a couple of bookmarks just for this book. So yes, I am pleased!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Help.  I guess I'm not smart enough to play without any directions or rules.  I enjoy this game but need game instructions.  Where do I find them?
0316055433|5.0|Donna Tartt is a very descriptive writer and I enjoyed her tale of redemption very much.  I am an art lover, and have seen the painting of Carel Fabritius's The Goldfinch &#34;in the flesh!&#34;  That's what made me buy the book....and I'm not sorry.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Nothing will every be a good as #1 movies.  However for this product the discs were in perfect condition.  We have watched it several times.  We always give the blue-ray copies to  friends.
B001V7YJMG|4.0|It was a good movie, not my favorite movie, but still good. I plan to watch the remake, to compare the two movies.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's fun and easy to learn how to play. I find that it helps me calm down at the end of the daily grind.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I could not put this book down the entire time I was reading it. I had to find out what happens to America. Although it is not support deep literature, it was perfect beach reading and I finished the book in one day! Can't wait for the next one.
B000SW16LC|4.0|Not the original but very good. Nice current version. Would recommend instead of original if never seen before. Always a good Santa story.
B000002MT0|5.0|I really enjoyed this album, this is a must have for any Prince and Vanity fan. You must add this to your collection.
B00ADS98FC|2.0|I bought this movie, and the quality is absolutely terrible! I don't know why it is so bad, but it gives me a headache when watching it. This is my favorite movie ever though!
B001HIJYR4|5.0|This is a must see movie, especially for any angelina jolie fan. This is a great movie to add to your collection. From action to all the great scenes. You mmust have this movie you buy this movie.
B001NY4X4G|5.0|This is another great movie. My husband doesn't usually like movies that have a lot to do with court cases and such, but he really enjoyed this one. I have seen the movie before, but didn't own it. That's why I bought it. Anyways, the quality of the movie was great and the movie is a MUST-SEE!
1571200851|4.0|I saw the author, Rebecca Wat on the old Alex Anderson tv show and decided to get her book.  It took some time to figure out the steps even though there are very good pictures of each step.  Once I got it , I made some beautiful fabric flowers. Several of my quilting friends have borrowed it and loved it too.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Since the inception of theses series I've enjoyed them more for their thoughtful and inciteful human analysis and social commentary than just the clever science fiction
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great movie, great acting, great script; Still a joy to watch after all these years!<br />Great for the whole family to watch
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a super fun movie with something for everyone.  Would highly recommend!  Watch for Amazon lightning deals for a great price too.
B0091W7K6K|5.0|Great movie, great acting, great script; Still a joy to watch after all these years!<br />Too bad they do not offer this movie in Blu-Ray
B0058X67OM|5.0|I am a fan of ELP A LONG TIME A GO AND THIS BOX IS EXCELENT FOR THE SONGS AND SOUND. I RECOMENDED FOR FANS OF ELP.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Great movie, great acting, great script; Still a joy to watch after all these years!<br />Too bad they do not offer this movie in Blu-Ray
B004EPYZTE|4.0|I wasn't expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised at the great production values. Obviously a lot of money was spent on the making of this movie. The film has great visuals, directing, and acting. I would say it is my favourite Conan to date as I prefer this darker, but beautiful, and rugged version of Conan compared to what I have seen before. This movie seemed more faithful to Robert E. Howard's Conan that I remember reading in my youth. I also thought that the film was comparable in quality to other films in this genre, like The Mummy, though without the humour. This time Conan is played more like a Shakespearean play with high drama. If there was one weakness I would say I would have liked to see more character development and less sword swinging action. All in all though a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />This film was filmed in 2D which might account for the fact that most of the 3D isn't as exaggerated as in movies like Avatar, The Avengers, or Tron.
B00358ESI4|5.0|Great movie, great acting, great script; Still a joy to watch after all these years!<br />Too bad they do not offer this movie in 3D Blu-Ray
B008ALA6DW|3.0|Let's start with this- the adapter does exactly what it claims to do. It shows up as an ethernet port in System Preferences, and indeed allows you to connect an ethernet cord to a Thunderbolt port. It does this more or less flawlessly.<br /><br />So why 3 stars? Sadly, because it's the victim of Apple's latest &#34;form over function&#34; design practices. Let me explain.<br /><br />Ethernet cords are pretty simple- they have two main parts: the cord and the clip. Why does every ethernet cord have a clip on it? Because of how disastrous randomly losing a network connection can be. Imagine you're running a server with say hundreds of users in a live environment and someone just pulls the ethernet cord out of the computer- you'd be pretty upset. Even if you're not in a professional (what &#34;pro&#34; supposedly stands for in &#34;MacBook Pro&#34;) environment, pulling an ethernet cord can mean interrupting downloads or streams or just about anything else you're using the network for. Also, truth be told, Finder's kryptonite seems to be losing ethernet connections, and as such will most likely lock up on you and/or crash when you do this.<br /><br />Up until recently, Apple put an ethernet port on their computers so you could clip the cord directly in, just like every other manufacturer. It worked great. With the introduction of the new Retina models, however, the ethernet port has been eliminated and replaced with a Thunderbolt port. Thunderbolt is superior in its versatility and speed with one MAJOR downside: there is no clip. So yes you can clip your ethernet line into this adapter, but the adapter will pull right out of your computer with almost no pressure needed.<br /><br />For people who use their Macs in professional environments, this is a sad development. Most people I know have resorted to taping the adapter to their computer, or simply refusing to upgrade to a machine that doesn't have built-in ethernet. It's an unnecessary source of additional stress to anyone who relies on their Mac for a living. Also somewhat embarrassing when a PC colleague says &#34;You spent $2500 on your laptop and you have to tape your adapters on.&#34;<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the Kensington ports.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it! great game, very fun and never gets old. Better then bejeweled and deffinitely a fan favorite. This really gives you something to do when you need something to keep you busy.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I dont have any resons but it shure takes a lot of bordness away, for exaple, when i came home from my soccer game i was sooooooooo bored, so i downloded it and played waaaaaaayyyy over time. ;D
B00F2362IE|5.0|This is great game, my son loves it and it is perfect for kids and adults! I was kinda worried it wasn't going to be easy for  my son but it was!
B002QVZ71I|1.0|I could never understand why this film was and still is so popular.The story is not even that great.Some slow inbred southerner lives through different eras...while playing college football,going to vietnam,saving his ungrateful lieutentant's life,showing Lyndon Johnson his bullet wounded ass,falling in love with his whorish drug headed hippie girlfriend...blah blah blah. Its just stupid. There are other Tom Hanks films out there,that are so much better,compared to this overhyped big waste of time.PHILADELPHIA,THE GREEN MILE and CASTAWAY...just to name a few. Check out Hanks' other movies and don't bother with this boring piece of crap.
B001UTW7QU|2.0|silly, ludicrous, x-files wanna-be, good A-/B+ female lead with good chemistry with other male lead, but can't bring up the C- story and writing. Watch old x-files instead!
B007D5E7C2|5.0|Contains both of Tarantino's classics! KILL BILL VOL 1 and KILL BILL VOL 2!!!! Hopefully soon,QT will make a KILL BILL VOL 3 ...especially since Elle Driver was never killed off. Let's just keep our fingers crossed... In the meantime.Enjoy these two great films!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It only works well with streaming video from YouTube or NetFlix. Don't expect much about its capability of streaming video from other formats.<br />Google Chromecast  will not become popular if it does not overcome its limitation and the capability of streaming other video formats such as Adobe flash, flv. etc.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Michael Connelly scored with this book.  Excellent, really could not put it down!!  I have suggested it to friends and family.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is just as good as instagram and is even better because it's free! I love it because I can look up anything I would want to. Have fun!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Good luck with this game it hard but it beastly I love it a assassination attempt to eat a man who was tripping over the first
B0037KMHRY|5.0|You will probably either love it or disregard it.  I love a lot of the tracks and also liked the movie.
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|Wonderful group of books. Well written and fun to read. It's nice to have a series of books with an ending.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My sister had this game and I never thought it would work on my kindle but it does and I love it and it may look like a boring game but it is really addicting! :)
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I truly love this game. It is a lot of fun. I am very excited to try the second version of this game!!!<br />I have played a lot of games like this but this one is not only fun but addictive as well. You can play on line or off line as well.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Holds you by the seat of your pants with the language, visuals, fighting, etc.  This continues in the tradition of past chapters in this series.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|A additive and mind challenging game. Been playing on this game for some time and i am still playing it. Loved the game.

B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Its fun.Its a fun action game to play on tablet. Enough to kill time with while waiting for bus etc.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Ever since &#34;American Idol&#34; I have been a fan of Phillip Phillips and enjoy this CD.  Looking forward to hearing more from, hopefully, another CD in the future.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A additive and mind challenging game. Been playing on this game for some time and i am still playing it
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Awesome in every respect.  There is plenty of frontal nudity both male and female.  There is language not heard in a long time which helps create the hooked feeling for this series.,
B003NS2T9G|3.0|Being a Doctor Who fan the next obvious step was to watch Torchwood.  I do not like it as much, obviously but I do keep watching for some reason.  It has a certain something that keeps me coming back.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|Most of the songs are a little too pop for me.  I like Justin and wish there would have been more variety in this CD.  At this point I am not buying the second part.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|This gift set offers both  black white original, and a colorized version of this classic movie.  A thrid disk gives background on the movie.  This is a great musical.  A must have for Crosby fans.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Top drawer and can understand why this could be the CD of the year.<br />This really makes you feel good.<br />Highly recommend.
0545128285|3.0|Purchased as a gift.  J.K. Rowling is a fine author.  Her story telling skills continue in &#34;Beedle&#34;.  Have read the story and found it interesting; am giving this book to a young friend who should enjoy it.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I love this game.  Got through the first time and have been working on my second time through at more difficult level.  I love that you can keep playing and playing and don't have to buy anything or wait to regenerate.  Just play!!  I skip some of the challenges at the end of each level so I'm not getting the extra bonuses to help me out.  Probably why it's taking so long.  That's ok, I'll be sad when it's over.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator Plus is very handy and performs well. What more can one ask of an app? Can you beat FREE?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|llthis is a fun realistic game we have 5horses of our own and this is a great way yo teach my two year old how to care for a horse beforeletting her help with our real ones
0739341340|5.0|Wow what a reference guide.  I bought the CDs years ago and downloaded to my iPod.  Over the years of family vacations and trips to grandma's house I've listened to this masterpiece. An excellent addition to &#34;Mastering the Complex Sale&#34;.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great app it has helped me keep up with weather when I am on the go and on cross state trips from one place to the other
0394806220|5.0|Classic book that all kids should have ages 1-5.  Everyone has fun reading and making the noises along with Mr. Brown. Great practice for fluency, expression and rhyming, reading readiness skills.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The only way to the church with just a good night good game and daddy the church with just a good night sleep tight and then I sat in my hands and then I sat in
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the fact that there is an option of an audio for the reading of this Bible.  It helps me tremendously in particular when it comes to pronouncing a lot of the names.
B005Z28M58|4.0|bought this for my sister she loves this show has them all but this on came on time and packed well thank you again and happy holidays.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|It's all like PEW PEW PEW then CRUNCH RAAAAWR BANG BANG and ELBOW ROCKET PUNCH!<br /><br />On a side note, the Blu-Ray looks great and sounds great. This is an awesome demo disc if you have a home theater. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention: OIL TANKER BASEBALL BAT!
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I wasn't able to watch this in theater but thanks to Amazon i didn't have to drive to town and hunt it on a red box live streaming on Amazon is great.. I loved the movie what an addition to the Die Hard Saga
B00G3HSF7O|2.0|The movie had a lot of action. But didn't seem that there was very much thought or sweat put into it!
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|This film is about a pilot who has a problem with alcohol and drugs. He has to face this after an accident. In the accident he perform better than good pilots who tried to simulate the accident. How do we judge a person who saves lives but is drunk?<br />It is not convincing story. People don't perform that good after drinking as much as he did. The beginning is slow. The acting is not bad.  I liked the end so I give it two stars.
B00GLQQ07E|5.0|A wonderfully composed and beautifully orchestrated score.  These songs are instantly singable and the Deluxe Edition offers a ton of extra offerings.  Definitely worth the purchase if you have kids that love to sing along.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|All I remember from the first time I read this and more. Some books just get better with \\"my ageing\\"'.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|I would honestly have to say I found this latest reboot of the iconic character to be just a bit disturbing. Certainly the visual and special effects were stunning, and there is plenty of action. The acting is fine, considering the story being told, and I even admired the attempt to make the entire saga more realistic.<br /><br />And perhaps that is the problem. Because Superman isn't supposed to be 'real'. Superman is a modern myth, like that of Zeus or Hercules or Mars, all rolled into one. It is only possible in a fantasy world because it is basically a morality tale. And the thing about morality tales is they can't have moral shades of grey. They are intended to clearly show what is right and what is wrong, and display the rewards and punishments of choosing either.<br /><br />But here the story is trying very hard to be 'real', and that makes it somewhat disturbing. For example, considering the amount of carnage and destruction wrought in high population areas throughout the film, it is impossible to escape the looming sense that quite a number of innocent bystanders are being slaughtered. We may not see bodies flying through the air in pieces, but when a skyscraper explodes in a ball of fire, it's difficult to accept that there was no one inside at the time.<br /><br />What makes that realization unsettling is the fact that Superman more or less chooses that as the battleground. As he was the focus of the aggression, being persued by Zod, he could just as easily have lured the enemies to the Gobi desert and had it out there. Instead he blows up his home town and half of Metropolis. Not what you would consider Superman behavior.<br /><br />And it's also difficult to reconcile the Superpowers which clearly toss all physics out the window, with a world with unbreakable physical limitations. And exactly what can and can't hurt these aliens? You can literally hit them with an entire building... repeatedly... and they don't sustain so much as a scratch. But you cansnap their necks easily enough. Huh?<br /><br />The other thing that just felt awkward and wrong was the not so subtle attempt to equate Superman to Jesus Christ. Granted, that is implied in the overall mythos of the character, as it is in all myths, but here they kind of poke you in the face with it. Superman is 33 years old. Hmmm. He's going to change the world. Hmmm. He has a heavenly (albeit computer stored) father. Big hmmm. And when that father sends him to Earth (from the spaceship Lois Lane has just been ejected from in an escape pod), he reminds his son he can save them all. Is it necessary for Superman to float out into space in a perfect crucifiction pose?<br /><br />So I suppose that in attempting to make this culturally iconic character more 'real', they simply exposed parts of him that are a little disturbing to consider. This is a film where it would not have been out of place to show Superman coming out of the bathroom with a newspaper in his hand to the sound of a flushing toilet.<br /><br />That's a bit too much reality for my taste.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I been hearing about this book all of my life.  Seen many movie versions (Disney one was the first) and of course, Bill Murray version.  But, I never read the book and finally got the opportunity, and all I can say is: READ IT!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so...amazing.  XD If you liked despicable me movies then you'll love this game. Me and my 5 yr old son love playing this game. :) Hope you enjoy the game as well :)
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I love Daniel Craig as James Bond. This one is one of the best as far as plot, excitement, and special effects.
0307454568|5.0|purchased this book as a gift for my fianc&eacute; and he loves it. was really pleased with the delivery of this item.
B005KJZDXK|3.0|I thought I'd like She & Him's Christmas album, but I find their delivery (well, mostly Zooey Deschanel's) annoying and end up skipping to the next track before the song is over.  I don't think Christmas songs are the best ones to rearrange or experiment with. I, for one, prefer just hearing them as they are traditionally sung.Their rendition of Baby, It's Cold Outside is especially disappointing compared to her performance of it in Elf which probably first generated my interest in her singing. It seems to me that she sings on this album in a purposely affected way, and fails to hold notes that should be held. I wanted to hear the full power of her voice and she doesn't seem to stretch herself that far. If you already know you like She & Him's sound, then you might enjoy this. As a first introduction to them, it was not as enjoyable as I expected.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent read. great way to spend a cold Sunday afternoon. This may be Grishoms best. would certainly recommend it to anyone whether you like courtroom drama or not.
B0030B0S2Q|5.0|A must-see for fans of &#34;hard&#34; science fiction. Amazing special effects, given what was apparently a very small budget. Sam Rockwell is very good.
B0006M4S28|1.0|it is in hong kong  language and you cannot watch it on a video player in america it is different region movie its just stupid
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Just watched this on my 100&#34; projection with dts audio and it was phenomenal. Every song is crystal clear with video as clear. This is my 4th Blu-ray concert dvd, if your thinking about buying this then stop thinking and get it!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app - I love that it tells me how my battery is performing and estimated usage times for various activities. (Reading, watching videos, Skyping, etc.)
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Arrived in perfect condition, in an expeditious manner and at a really great price. Was able to use reward points.
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|becaouse it wood not play when I got it and I didn't get a chance to send it back very dissapointed
B0000DZU4U|5.0|If you're into the Rock and Roll Animal CD for the guitar, then you may want this one too. Satellite of Love and Vicious have some REALLY good lead guitar. I can't recall the other songs very well, as I had this as a cassette like 25 years ago and didn't even know this CD was available.... they should have bundled this with RR Animal as a double album to begin with. I'm buying this.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Good story but predictable  I may have just read too many of his books ........ I guess not every book will be The Firm
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun fun fun my whole family plays this game it is great. We love it. I like how they do updates and seasonal themes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|have not had any issues with this game and it keeps me coming. back. great for younger kids as well
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The visual effects are great, although I wish you could earn more coins at the beginning, so you c sass n expand a bit faster.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Let me start off by saying I loved this series up until the ending of this book. I don't want to give any spoilers but I hate that Veronica Roth didn't think about her fans when writing the ending. This is the most disappointing book I've ever read. I wish I hadn't spent all my time and money spent on this series. I will be refusing to spend another penny on any of her following works.  She did not think of the readers and how invested we had become in the books and characters.  Very disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is totally addicting so be prepared!  Perfect way to spend time in a dr's waiting room. Without sound of course.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent!  I loved all of these books and I have loved both of the movies so far.  Well written and easy to read.  A real page turner.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|What a great story. Really liked the story line and believable characters. For not being modern, Rose really caught on quick.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|This game is great, I love the story line and graphics are good. The content of game is a challenge and I am enjoying playing it. I would recommend this game to anyone beginner or advanced player.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Like it's predecessors, this novel is well written, it's plot is intricate and has depth, and except for a few parts it certainly keeps one's attention.  One thing to realize is that you must have read the preceding books to be able to follow this (or the preceding one) book.  I think that Stieg Larsson was highly talented, and I wish he was still alive and writing.  All in all, this was a terrific read and I highly recommend it.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|Half the price I would have paid in the store and it comes new and sealed! I LOVE this series!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I freaking love this game. However... I wish the exchange included all &quot;currencies&quot; to be traded for each other. I could have all the pearls I need to complete quests if I could trade sand dollars or algae for them. Seriously, who has too many pearls and not enough of the others? If anyone has this luxury, I'd like to know your secret.
B00FKAA3MA|3.0|Some brilliant moments and some PISS POOR  moments .No Dre beats , but Rick Rubin does a solid job with 4 tracks . &#34; Love Game and &#34; Berzerk &#34; are dope , but his other two beats are TERRIBLE . &#34;So Far &#34; is experimental , but it just plain sucks . &#34; Bad Guy &#34; is a beauty . The song where he sings the entire time is just plain DREADFUL .Lyrically it's as good as it gets . The lyrics on here are every bit as good as Nas or Rakim in their primes . Dre being absent is easy to pick up , as there are zero thumping beats .
0892818875|5.0|This is one of my favorite aromatherapy books in my library.It addresses the emotional and mental well being of your health using aromatherapy!
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|Great game, but it suddenly started refusing to open if it doesn't have access to the app store. Kind of disappointing since this is already a paid version, and I don't WANT my kids to have access to the app store.
0891419063|5.0|Profoundly personal and inspiring as well as informative and interesting.  A story that needs to be told and read my ALL Americans.  An insight into an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances who rises to the occasion and pays a terrible price as well.
B00GNL96H8|2.0|This movie was more focused on creating a mistic mood relating to martial arts heritage, and Ip Man. I just wanted to see more Ip Man kicking butt, just in a bigger budget movie. No go. Too much....artistry with the scenes. Watch Ip Man 1 and 2, they are way better.
B002VT6C0K|2.0|well written, of course, but not particularly interesting.  They want 12 more words so this sentence exists to make meet their arbitrary standard.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|If &#34;you saw the movie,&#34; you *must* read the book. If you read the book when you were a kid, revisit it as an adult and you might reshape your thinking about the entire premise. A happy way to spend a weekend.
0762434260|5.0|A three part screw together item that is resin material. Great replica of the actual movie prop. We're very please with it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|It is black and says Sony on it. When you turn up the volume my ears bleed. I can't sleep.
B00G21YLF6|5.0|Great show! If you're a Doctor Who geek, you need this. Will delight you with the usual twists and turns.
B0000009RT|4.0|What can you say about this early experimental classic?  Not pretty to listen to, they are ugly mothers after all, but interesting and odd.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is really fun. You try to evolve a pathogen to eradicate all humans on earth. Kind of a scary premise but then this game also helps you realize just how difficult that would be.
1594133379|5.0|My father had a stroke years before this book was written.  I wish I would of been able to read it back then. Great insight !!!
B005FITIGO|4.0|The beginning chapters of the incredible collapse of the financial markets in the United States in 2007 and 2008 is a great choice for a film since it has the potential to humanize the great risks the large financial firms took as they purchased unsound mortgages, packaged them as securities, and sold them to their customer base. This film certainly humanizes this unsettling event in this country’s financial and economic history. However, as I watched the film I felt that the dialogue and actions of the actors may be beyond the comprehension of those who have little understanding of economics and finance or who did not pay much attention to the meltdown that was experienced in the final months of the George W Bush presidency and which stretched into the Obama presidency and required considerable funds to prop up the over-extended financial industry.<br /><br />I think the film made a wise choice to focus on the downsizing and layoffs that occur during these financial emergencies rather than go too far in depth regarding hedge funds, derivatives, and banks that are too big to fail. Instead the focus was placed upon the characters in an un-named financial firm and the impact of the economic crisis on the lives of these people. Heads do roll in this film and it was fascinating to see who survives and who goes when the going gets tough.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci plays an experienced risk manager whose economic model indicates there is considerable risk for the firm as it takes bundled unsafe mortgages and collateralizes them as securities. Since the process requires analysis of the risks of various bundles, the securities stay on the books for over 30 days, creating a considerable vulnerability should the market for these securities evaporate, which is exactly what happened in reality and in the film.<br /><br />Zachary Quinto plays the role of a bright PhD physicist with a specialty in propulsion who fits the pieces together after Tucci is laid off. Quinto’s character demonstrates that the rewards on wall street are so much greater than academia that some of the brightest minds are attracted to the oversized rewards that Wall Street offer.<br /><br />Demi Moore plays the role of a top executive in charge of risk management for the firm. It is ultimately her model that has been unable to predict that the firm is so over-committed to underwater mortgage-backed securities that the total potential loss exceeds the firm's total market capitalization value. She thinks that all those colleagues of hers in the top management tier will pay the price but her assumption proves wrong.<br /><br />Paul Bettany, Kevin Spacey, Simon Baker, and Jeremy Irons are the four exceptional actors who play the four layers of management at the firm, all of whom have various motivations for their work and perspective on the financial crisis. Young Penn Badgley is a 24 year old making $250,000 a year at an entry level job who has become obsessed with the corporate structure and the ever increasing financial rewards in this business.<br /><br />The financial crisis of 2007-2008 has much complexity but this film put one aspect of that crisis into human dimensions and thus is a very entertaining film.
0385508417|2.0|Christmas is a special celebration for all classes of people.  However, this book was totally focused on the upper-middle class celebrating in ways other classes of people would not identify with.  The way it went on about spending money to impress and buy happiness was showing how so many upper-middle class fail to grasp the true meaning of Christmas. The characters were spoiled and behaved badly.  Nora was rude and unkind to Luther up to the very end.  I did not appreciate the way she treated her husband.<br />Blair was placed on a pedestal treating her like she wasn't supposed to ever be disappointed.  What kind of wife will she be?  If she is like her mother, that fiance had better take note and run.<br /><br />It could have been a good book, but it wasn't.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Like the game a lot, do not get rewards all the time & lose tokens, but nothing is perfect. Great
B0064T6LV8|1.0|There are better pinball games out there. I deleted this right off my kindle after playing a few times. Not great not much fun
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Angry birds game you have to figure out your own moves and game. I still like angry birds friends better
B0093QE37S|5.0|This is a classic movie movie no explosions, no shooting, no car chases. Just a suspend belief movie the dialog is what you listen for it is full of great lines and of course you have Grant and Hepburn and Stewart  It is a nice plot and it stays on point. This was how a movie was made before they had color and bursting bombs because the studio find them to be cheaper than paying stars of this magnitude if there are any left..
B00B5HQL50|1.0|Absolutely non-James Bond style.  Or feel for that matter either.  Way too unnecessarily and atypically dark and in general quite a departure from the traditional genre.  Are we trying to mix in Alfred Hitchcock to the cocktail, or was that just another example of pandering to the more recently emerging status quo bent toward darkening previously lighter (though no less riveting and entertaining) fare
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is amazing it's fun and challenging. This game involves you in it and it's exciting to take the blocks and build another part on the cool looking town.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|They say this game is really good for a reason.  Don't buy it for the Flow or Flower though.  However, Journey is awesome.  Do yourself a favor though and don;t look up any walk through for the game until you play through it at least twice.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book!  Amazing tale. A young boys adventure into adult situations as he is trained to save the Earth. Fast read.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This is one the best movies ever made.  I watch it every fall.  It is incredibly meaningful, touching, beautiful and funny.  The most underrated movie of the last few decades.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|i like it and all BUT, i really was hoping to cast a tab via mobile devices like my nexus 7 or my phone. :( the programs on here work really well and everything but doesnt do anything i already had. I believe more updates and compatible apps will be coming soon so keep your fingers crossed and thats about it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the most challenging and engrossing game I've played in years.  I almost dismissed it as too childish too explore...now I'm hooked.
B00G4NUQYM|5.0|I'm addicted.  I get started and I can't put it down. I'm learning new worlds and being challenged.  What I like most is that if I really get stuck there are hints, jumbled answers, and outright answers, or you can skip it, go to another \\"puzzle\\" and come back to it later.  Great fun.
0375869026|5.0|Amazing!!  Touching story with a great message. The author has a great voice and makes you rethink people who are different and how you treat others. My daughter read it, loaned it to her 6th grade teacher (who read it to the class), and now we are reading it together because she wanted to share it with me too.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is a very good game,you always have some thing to do on the game.I love it,I really think you will love it to.
B005O64VH8|5.0|A truly beautiful compilation of Secret Garden pieces.  One of my many Secret Garden albums.  Wonderful, rich orchestral and vocal music.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I love the game exactly like the pc version except for the fact that on my kindle the servers are off line has anyone else experiences this?
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Loved the movie and now have it in my DVD library.  Beautifully written, acted and directed.  Edward Norton is sensational.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Great app I play it all day. The best part is its free. I would really recommend it to people who like super heroes
B005U9RE1Y|5.0|This is the first movie I ever saw in a theater, I have loved this movie since I was one years old. So my five star rating may be a bit bias. Its a magical movie, that can be enjoyed over and over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's pretty good.<br /> I love playing it. It's kinda better than Temple Run. People should play this game  a lot.
B0081SRJSY|2.0|The game mechanics with ok and it's cute, but there are some big issues for me. 1. If I swipe to pan the board and touch a valid placement, it puts the tile there (I can move it, but I can't out it bank in the starting spot; 2) atthe end of the game I want it to show the ending layout.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love having a miniature keyboard to take with me everywhere. I like recording a melody and playing along with it. I'm learning more to do with it everyday. This is a great App.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Top notch entertainment. Tough to watch, but it is worth it for the performance of Denzel Washington and a superb cast.
B001XUH69Y|4.0|Casablanca is a classic.  The story is daring and examines the difficult decisions in life, decisions we make for love and for integrity, and how sometimes the two seem to conflict.  It's a story of what true love looks like- not a lust fest, but sacrificial.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|I like the write-up on this, so we decided to try it on a trip.  However, we haven't had a chance to use the app, but will try it soon.  The reviews on this app seemed more positive than other apps.  I will be better able to give a review once we use this on a trip.
B000065V42|3.0|This movie was a little stupid at times.  Rick Moranis was his idiotic self.  the children will like it because it will make them laugh.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I liked it, but wish it wasn't all in the point of the kid. I would have liked to know what was going on inside the mom's head. But still good.
B00008L3U1|5.0|Great movie.  Good for all ages.  Jack is a boy who grows into a man in his first 8 years.  Can be sad at times, but has a great storyline.  I shows how he copes with his disability all the way to graduation.  Shows children that if someone is different it doesn't mean they are mean or stupid.  truly a good film.
B005COO1X6|4.0|As always with Stephen King, he scares the crap out of you with his scenarios. But, also as usual well written.
B00005T7I1|4.0|a true Dick Tracy film.  Close to the film strip, all characters  involved.  Well made.  If you like Dick Tracy you will love  this.  If not you will find it very dry.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Because it is fun and keeps me interested in playing each level. Keeps my mind sharp as I try to figure out how to defeat each level.
B0080BFWAE|5.0|This movie is pure eighties fun. In the advent of the summer blockbuster we lost touch with the storytelling of the middle-budgeted movie, this one catching a young director (having written a personal favorite GREMLINS) Chris Columbus doing what he does best: ENTERTAIN. And Elizabeth Shue, an under-rated &#34;girl next door&#34; rises above that tired cliche to create an all too often forgotten multi-generational classic that should rate higher to &#34;Ferris Bueller's Day Off,&#34; the period's limelight.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|have read this several time. Can see the movie in my mind while reading. Makes me wish for life like it's protrayed here. But, it does deal with the obstacles we face in our lives.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|One of the all time great movies! I would highly recommend this movie as well as The Shawshank Redemption and the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|It's a pretty good game, albeit slightly basic gameplay-wise. A must-have for those who own the console version. And it's free.
B00BEIYMIS|3.0|Have to say that ultimately I was disappointed with this film. I had built up quite an anticipation to viewing this film once available on DVD due to the hype, buzz, and promotion when released to theaters. But having just viewed it last night, I came away scratching my head, wondering what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />The Conjuring is just another film in the Amityville Horror vein, with nothing new brought to the table and nothing to make it really stand out of said genre. True, genuine scares are few and far between, and the film suffers from a very slow beginning.<br /><br />However, after about the first 1/2 hour, things do pick up. A bigger budget than usual for films of this ilk does allow for some impressive special effects. Lili Palmer, Vera Farmiga, and Patrick Wilson do a good job in their respective roles.<br /><br />Overall, The Conjuring was a mixed experience - I don't regret the two hours spent with this film, but I guess I let myself get caught up in the hype surrounding this movie. It's certainly not one of the scariest movies of all time nor an original story (again, its title could have been The Amityville Horror - 2013), but its fine cast and occasional creepy moments make it worth a viewing.
B00G4A6VZS|5.0|It's a fun way to get the children to like geography. My whole family loves this game. It's a great game!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|a great read - very funny.  A little reminiscent of &#34;the curious incident of the dog in the night time&#34; but a more adult read.
B00164GDA0|5.0|This movie I feel is a family movie very interesting I feel like<br />it is a story when I was a kid and no I'm only a young man.<br />we were all kids at one time this is what the story is about<br />kids will be kids it is well worth buying this DVD.<br />five stars all the way.<br />DDA.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This is a great film. If you like the Beatles you need to see this. This is a great movie that is told using their music. All the songs are done well without butchering their songs.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|I love the influence of classic metal with the signature sounds of an Avenged Sevenfold album. Overall a solid album!
B000065K6N|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Not going to post a lengthy review, it is a story all people should experience at least once!<br /><br />The only downfall is that it is in DVD and not Blu-Ray, but the quality is better than ever!
B00511ONPG|5.0|Great book - as a relative novice in social media, I found both the philosophy of, and practical information in, this book to be extremely useful.  Hopefully I can put the information in this book to good use.
B004Q3SGWG|3.0|like always, the book was better.  The majority of the movie set up the main plot, whereas, the majority of the book was spent on the character trying to get out, and what was going through his head and so on.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|So far I am on region 5 and is so much better than other on I have 17 guns and I $55,00 thousand dollars
0399160477|5.0|Classic Clancy.  I will have to read slowly, as he is gone.  So sad. A great loss.<br />  A die hard Clancy fan.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I have to say that this game defenitely keeps you entertained. Although I do wish it wouldn't start me over as many times as it has. But overall I really do love it!
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I love Dexter. I got hooked on the series and I own all except the last episode but I plan on ordering it soon.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is cute and very addictive..it is also very easy for your kids to play and mine love it
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|The game is great until you get to higher levels then it just comes to a standstill because there is no way to earn pearls - you have to pay for them
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is awesome you really have to use your brain. These tricky and brain teasing levels works on your memory skills and is so much fun for adults and children I highly recommend this app for everyone.<br /><br />  -Keylie Criqui
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game:)!&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts; I think it is a great braking teaser. even my math teacher recommends it. love it &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;
031623480X|3.0|This book is very technical with lots of research material and medical terminology. Just give me the facts and a list of do's and don'ts.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Extraordinary writing, plot construction, acting, directing. etc.  Superb for a TV series, grade of &#34;B&#34; if it were a movie.  Production values all around  very sophisticated for a TV series.  Really good acting, Mandy Patimkin is first rate and probably his best film work so far because it is a very good part to play and he nails it. Fortunately he and the writing make the character dimensional instead of a mere prop for Clair Danes' character..  I've seen the entire first season so far and am addicted to it.  Of course, by stretching out the story so much, it's a rough challenge to keep it at a high level throughout, but a pleasure to see the huge artistic and corporate commitment. It demonstrates a fascinating new phase of non-theatrical filmmaking and portends exciting new possibilities for artistic excellence. Yet to be seen whether this format can ever reach the perfection that has been and can be reached in a memorable feature-length film.
B0041T4ML4|4.0|Wow. A really interesting story. I still tell friends to read it years later. It really makes you think, which is what I enjoy the most in any story. Only drawbacks are that it's got a slow start, and there is frequent use of other languages, making it difficult to understand what is being said.
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|This book was not as good as ealier books by Preston and Child. There was not as much of a gripping storyline.  It is still a pleasurable read. It is better than most of the mainstream writing out there.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Unsatisfying. Predictable ending. The writing is not as clever as the writer thinks it is. I'm not sure how this ended up on the best seller list.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Speechless because I am sobbing because a beautiful story of what love is , should be, acquires to be.  Reminds me that we not mere beings but made of God.  I have claimed to have never read a book more than one time, this book will end all future claims.
B00EZFN3KK|5.0|dido is probably one of the greatest singer & composer of the 21st century. so much better than taylor swift in every way. 5 stars all the way.
B004N6369Y|5.0|I feel this is one of Danielle Steel's best novels.  Enjoyed reading it and would definitely recommend to others to read
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I was surprised that I liked this. It's definitely different than the first movie, but, actually, I liked it better. Would've liked to have seen more of Karl Urban than his teeth :) but he was great as a super serious Dredd. Very dark, brooding, and effective take on a violent future. Cool to see a really rotten, crazy female villain for a change, too. Decent movie. I'd watch again.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|If you love Mad Men get all of the dvd/blu-rays. There are 2 commentary tracks for every episode. I love that everyone involved with the show really cares about their work. The commentaries provide great behind the scenes stories.
0385738765|5.0|this was a very good book and the author did a great job keeping you guessing as to what would happen next.
B00FGH3TGO|5.0|So much fun! I can't believe I am enjoying songs by a 17 year old! And these are all different songs from the Pure Heroine CD.
0385738781|5.0|I really enjoyed the series of all 3 books.  Each book a read made me want to read the next.  when I finished the 3 book I was upset that there was no more of the series
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|Norah and Billie Joe sound wonderful on these old songs. All of the 12 tracks are great. I have always loved Billie from Green Day, know I like him even more.
0062014536|4.0|this book is a part the delirium trilogy and I found the writing style to be enjoyable.  I would recommend the book to anyone who likes a little romance  I read all 3 books in 1 week
B003WFKJRE|5.0|As has been stated by many others, this is an extremely good benchmark recording.  It easily ranks amongst the most significant of the available Ring recordings, along with Keilberth, Solti, Bohm and others.  The cast of singers is exceptional and the interpretation of the conductor is masterful.  The quality of the recorded sound is quite good for the era, although the orchestra is recessed.  Buy this set for the voices, which are captured beautifully here.
006197806X|4.0|The set of books was very well done and I enjoyed the writing style of the author all 3 books were great  I all 3 books within a week
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|I loved it!  Joss hit it out of the park yet again.  My favorite Shakespeare movie yet.  Now he just needs to do Twelfth Night.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This was an AWESOME find, all Columbo in one package, really enjoy Peter Falk, he did an AWESOME job in the series.
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|Exit Humanity is a strange western that blends the zombie and western genres together in a post Civil War tale of survival. It's main character's dialogue offers a message of hope and resilience.  It has great atmosphere, scenery and action. There is some animated action segments tossed in with the live action (a la Kill bill) to help with the low budget and they are done masterfully. I wasn't expecting much when I watched this movie at first but It surprised me and that is why I bought it! 10/10 great film, highly recommended
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Funny, well written and great characters. Really enjoyed this pick me up light read and would recommend it to others.
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|First off I'm not going to compare I Am Legend as a faithful adaptation. I will say this, this movie does everything better. It has atmosphere, tension and the depth of this post-apocalyptic vampire vision is amazing! A whole new society and way of living is brilliantly thought out and it gives it a feeling of realism.  People trade using goods, buy things with vamp teeth and the way the survivors react is so elaborate. From hyper-religious doomsday cults, to safe haven communities, it's just brilliant. The scenery is awesome and the tone is very fitting!  The action is good and the characters are relatable. In short this is a very good movie and it caught me by surprise.
B0016CVN02|5.0|Great CD of their hits from this time period.  If you don't want all the CD's then I would just get the hits.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|I've seen this movie before and it has been a while so I forgot some scenes. When I rewatched it upon buying, the scenes that I forgot about definitely had me taken back! It was still a poignant film and the ending just as chilling.  Don't look up the premise or spoilers trust me you'll appreciate it better!  This is French Extremity at it's best!
0060775858|5.0|Bought this as a present for a baby shower.  A simple, sweet story.  Books are a timeless gift that never go out of style.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|Little Shop of Horrors is a musical that gives nod to it's title film and the classic b-movie horror/sci fi's many have come to love. It has catchy musical numbers and is a memorable movie. Making a musical about a human eating  Venus Flytrap from space is a tall order and it is done masterfully! Great movie, highly recommended! 10/10
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Loads of fun and very habit forming.  So glad I am able to get this on my Kindle Fire.  I love the challenges you get.  Have to really think about your moves.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|RHPS is a campy rock n' roll musical nod to the classic B-movie horror and Scifi of yore.  It has catchy numbers sure to get stuck in your head.  Tim Curry is hilarious in his iconic gender bending, pansexual role as Dr Frankenfurter (think bugs bunny in drag for adults).  There is a reason this movie is played still as a midnight feature (especially around Halloween).  It has withstood the test of time and done the Time warp once again!  The only negative thing I have to say is that I was misled by this movie,  I did NOT SEE androids fighting Brad and Janet! >: / I mean COME ON  I was waiting for that! I mean how awesome would that be!  But NOOO they didn't have that scene in the entire movie!  ಠ_ಠ<br /><br />All things considered though 10/10 Great Cult Classic movie, highly recommended!
B008Q0D32S|5.0|Truly a classic. Great cast with Fonda as villainous as one could get. The music is unbelievably beautiful for a Western fitting the story line and gorgeous location shooting. This is a masterpiece of cinematography and story telling. Some complain of the stoic acting, especially by Bronson,  but I found it compelling and conclusive to his role as a vengeance seeking troubled man. I can watch this film on so many levels. The acting, directing, cinematography, music all combined to produce a legend of the Western genre. A masterpiece in every respect.
B000ASATYO|5.0|Directors cut review:<br />The Frighteners is a great movie with a misleading but still cool cover.  It's more of a lighthearted off the wall horror comedy movie.  Michael J. Fox's last feature length film in which he plays supernatural conman Frank Banister who uses ghosts to haunt people and he &#34;gets rid of them&#34; for a fee.  Things turn south when a serious threat arises and Frank and his ghost buddies team up to save the day! It serves as Peter Jackson's first full budget film, with great special effects.  It also marks a turn in his career from his low-budget campy cult classic romps to a mainstream release.  The Director's cut is 14 minutes longer has a plethora of extras and is a two sided disc.  10/10 great film, highly recommended!
B008J34466|4.0|This was a great purchase.  My daughter has played this CD to death and absolutely drove everyone in the family crazy with this in the car.  We that don't like Pink now have this CD memorized.  But the price was great and so was the purchase.
B00006IRJU|5.0|I've always been Icehouse fan.  The first time I purchased this CD, somebody ripped it off so I had to purchase it a second time.  It was much more costly the second time but well worth it.  Also, it does not leave my house this time!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|What nicer way to kill time than with a game-killing game. Easy to use. Bit difficult without the starter pack. Pay the $5. Worth it for the head start.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Love the twists and turns. Great characters and always interesting new characters which my be only a one time appearance but fun.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|this is a really good read. It reminds me of the need for resolution of serious conflict between us and good estate planning.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to set up and can be used with PC, or smartphone. Portable so can be taken from one tv to another
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|What a wonderful collection!  Peter, Enchantment and Stardust - The Poems (Peter: A Darkened Fairytale) is a must for any reader that appreciates truly brilliant writing.  William O'Brien's crafty, creative and cheerful words made it feel as if it were being read to me.  Each poem is incredibly unique visually.  I originally planned to read a few at a time but I kept wanting more and I kept turning the pages.  This great read is is one I know I will read many times.  I have a few favorite tales from my first read and I am guessing I will have more favorites each time I read it again.  Wonderfully done and 5-Stars does not do this justice.  Enjoy!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This app is super awesome.100 0/0 not a troll. This is a must have app.<br />Get upgrades and become stronger than the lizzard. Totally worth 6.99!
0385737955|3.0|The book was really creative. It is very interesting that the kids and the young adults can be way high up and still live like normal people as far as breathing and gravity goes. The people in the book were far smarter than I ever could be, which is ironic since their memory was wiped. They didn't know why they were there or how they were there. I had mixed feelings about how happy the ending was.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Believe the hype.  Its entertaining and great for passing the time.  You can easily play it sitting in a doctors office or between class.
B00AFEY354|4.0|works fine on some of our DVD players but some of our players like the portable ones it will not play!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy Crush review-it's fun and addicting, but I have other games I prefer.  I have trouble getting from level to level but I am new to this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is amazing and I'm obsessed with it. I have to play it like every day.  I just wish you could have more than 5 lives at a time.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I've become ridiculously addicted to this show.  I never watch CBS so I've totally missed out on this terrific show.  With many television shows filled with graphic violence, I love that this show has the drama, suspense and intelligence that is so engaging.  My favorite way to watch a series is one after the other in a long obsessive stretch.  I'm about half way through Season 2 and the plots keep getting better, deeper and more twisted.  I was hooked from the first show...
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun Solitaire game. I have played it for years on the computer. Now I can play it on my Kindle.
B00796E7CA|1.0|This isn't a good book for Kindle.  It's too difficult to manage if you want to flip back and forth to the maps or read the footnotes along with the text.  Buy the real book.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Difficult to say something about the book without getting caught up in the contents. I was not a big fan of Steve Jobs. I'm more of a Steve Wozniak fan. Still, the book is well written and presents a clear picture of the person Steve Jobs. Regardless of what you think about Steve Jobs.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|GREAT MOVIE HORRIBLE VIDEO---START AND STOP MORE THAN 3 TIMES!!! FOURTH TIME THIS HAPPENED IN ONE WEEK<br /> AND I AM A PRIME MEMBER  BOO AMAZON!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A remarkable story with enduring characters. It is well worth reading, but I would not want to see the movie version.
B00190N4E4|5.0|We should all know the story of Gandhi.  The partitioning of India into two countries was a mistake, and while Gandhi was forced to agree to the creation of Pakistan by a Muslim leader, Gandhi was assassinated as a result of the human suffering that followed.
0385537131|5.0|It is back to the quality of A Time to Kill. Thanks. It's wonderful to read a good novel again.
B000GT7XXW|2.0|Hamlet is a famous story in Shakespeare literature. However, it wasn't interesting to watch on Amazon. I hope other people who watched this video enjoyed it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Book went against the first two. Plot was bad and had the worst ending ever. It was such a disappointment especially after reading divergent and insurgent.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|This movie was very interesting to see another perspective on Denzel Washington's character who became an alcoholic and drug addict. I liked how his new girlfriend who he met wanted him to go to rehab to stop his addiction and chose not to join him on his trip to Jamacia.
0596805888|5.0|I have now bought two copies of this book, one for my dad and one for my boyfriend, just might get another one for me! I really like the way things are explained in this book and the view it gives you on cooking.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing and heartbreaking all in one. It is a must read for everyone of all ages. This book will literally change the way you view your life.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A most read, beautifully poetic, a new and refreshing account of an old tale. Best book I have read in a long time.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Not always a fan of sequels but this one definitely became a quick favorite! Casting was perfect and special effects are great!
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|Good plot, couldn't guess exactly what was going to happen. Love the King & Maxwell books, I don't think there's been a weak one.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I played this on ps3 and I have to say I like the mobile version better but either way injustice is pretty awesome
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fair warning to you who have not read it, you will cry like a baby. I do every time I read this book. Honestly the book is a little rushes and you might have to reread a few things but it is still one of my favorites.
