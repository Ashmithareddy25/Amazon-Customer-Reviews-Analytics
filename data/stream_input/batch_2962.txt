B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Was great to catch up with little Danny Torrance all grow up. Solid read, lots of bumps and bruises as the pages turned. And as with all of his books the pages couldn't turn fast enough.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Not the typical supernatural teen drama, this story really takes you in. You can identify with the characters an what they are going through. Change against will, bullying, small-town mindset, etc...
B00F5FEZTC|5.0|Not what you'd really expect from Sir Elton, but I'm thoroughly enjoying it.  I would recommend, but preview it first to make sure it fits your taste
B000E0LB8G|4.0|The only problem I find is that the fortepiano sounds a bit weak, but you get used to it quickly.<br />Other than that this is an excellent album. The orchestra's performance is better than the other 2 recordings of these concertos that I have. Since the forterpiano's sustain is shorter than a piano, it sounds clearer than a piano, and those concertos parts where the keyboard is hit with many keys sound much clearer than in a piano.<br /><br />Also since the fortepiano's sound is weaker, it gives more understanding to why Beethoven used the piano as it did - to squeeze out of it all he could get until the last drops..<br /><br />All in all the cocertos in this recording sound beautiful, more powerful, and most important, most comprehendible. You can better grasp the concertos with this recording, and later, enjoy more the other recordings of these concertos you have.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is the coolest thing to do when you have nothing to do.It will have you hook for hours I guarantee you. Download this game and enjoy your self some zombie killing....
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Very disappointed.  Bought this only to find out that it doesn't work with the Motorola RAZR Maxx even though it is an android,or windows Xp.  Amazon needs to find out and publish what exact systems their products work with before selling them.  Will be returning this.  Its worthless to me.  Wish it wasn't.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it's so cool I can play it for 5 hours and I never get bored you should buy it quickly and enjoy the fun!!!!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This is a great show all the way around!<br />Great acting, great directors, and greatly produced!!  Can't say enough about first season
B0050XFY4O|5.0|Very strange but good! I don't see how anyone could fall in love with their brother, but this does somewhat make you not judge. After all their relationship was pretty strong.
B00EL8I8IS|4.0|Good Zombie flick. Still like slow moving Zombies. Good action and effects. Story line had a few holes. Get it now.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|This is a high quality,fun game. A lot better than Asphalt 7. I enjoy the many different seasons. The controls are flawless. I don't like having to pay for cars or point.
B00EB6F1TY|3.0|Not bad, same old stuff. But what do you want from action movie? Sit back and watch the action. Did like effects.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have found swift key to be the best of the typing helpers out there - its only been a few weeks that i have used it, and it already makes my typing and texting on my phone so much easier and faster.  I am older and texting is a new feature to me, but my kids live by it - this program has helped so much - it learns how you say things and predicts what word you need next - sometimes i can do a whole message by only actually typing only a few letters - because it has learned my patterns and predicts what I am going to say -<br />This program is well worth upgrading from the free version, and I have done that
B00AHH0XOY|5.0|Wonderful movie with cute twist. Kept us all happy and entertained. Can't wait to watch again! Love that it is instant stream.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Right from the start the author captured me.  The store took me along with Clark, the main character, pulling me into her emotions and her hopes for the future.  The ending, well you must read it.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Some parts were harder to get through, almost seemed dragged out, but other than that it was a good book. I felt like it was an ending to a series not so much a cliff-hanger to the next one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The set, acting and costuming all combine to make this one great series.  And the ability to watch it on my laptop is GREAT!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really like this game. So happy they fixed the problem with feeding the horses. Wish they added more grooming options
B00D6DVSAE|4.0|The first CD is well put together, and considering the songs are show tunes, it is well put together. The songs are growing on me slowly, and are somewhat catchy. The second CD consists mostly of songs directly of the stage, which are a bit out of context and not my favorite, only exception: Practical Arrangement duett
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I am a school student and I have to wake up at 6 am every day and this app lets you subsututen that stupid buzzer noise for hour favorit toons ya its cool like that.
B005LJK3AC|4.0|Can relate to this movie because I worked with people just like these people in the movie so that might be why I liked it so much. Kevin Spacey is once again superior.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I loved this book. The author has created a story that explores the all encompassing love a mother has for her children. Her characters don't pretend to be perfect, they have very human flaws highlighted in the aftermath of a tragedy.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Easy fun game for my kindle fire. You do not have to pay for the game. Great to help work your mind.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|We enjoy magic so the storyline held our interest.  A bit confusing at times but very enjoyable.  Loved the effects.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|As with the other novels I've read of Sir Arther. There is a feeling that you have welcomed into the families k
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Hated the ending but time must move on.  Glad to see James becoming more sensitive - the &#34;Pussy Galore days&#34; were fun but I find the current James more interesting.
B005544V6A|4.0|Great fun (although not a realistic interpretation of the speed at which things happen -- or the brilliance that many lawyers show!)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought this story was just for young people until I saw the movie.  It made me immediately buy and read the books.  Wish there were more than 3 books.  The premise of the series is frightening, all the more because t seems almost possible.  We certainly seem to be a society of &#34;Haves and Have Nots&#34;.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|With all the garbage that's on TV these days, it's very refreshing to see show that display family values, community support and still has a type of mystery and excitement to it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was one I couldn't put down.  It was equal parts sad as it was beautiful about first love and loss.  This is a must read.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Heaving Fun playing this game. Easy to learn and get slightly addicted to. Kids have been enjoying it but it is mostly mom who plays it (I do not like the kids messing up my reef!). That's all I have to say but the review won't let me post unless I put in more words.
1591845556|3.0|This book promised a lot and I had high expectations for it, but unfortunately the author's ideas are unoriginal. He does lay out clear steps to acquiring skills, which is nice, but it is nothing that I couldn't have figured out on my own. As other reviewers have noted, he spends very little time fleshing out his theory of rapid skill acquisition, preferring to recount his experience acquiring various skills, including yoga and ukulele. Consequently, the only chapter that I carefully read in addition to the first three introductory chapters was the chapter on programming, which I found interesting solely because I want to learn to program. (The chapter in the book didn't give me any unusual guidance.)<br /><br />Here's the deal: If you want to &#34;learn anything,&#34; it's going to take hard effort. Just get up and start.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I play this game for hours @ a time. I love this game. It is easy to lose track of time.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I am totally shocked by how much I enjoy this show; had it not been for AmazonPrime, I more than likely would have never even given SOA a chance!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|What a great show! Whoever put together this cast did an excellent job. I did not think it was possible to replicate Bones personality but it was great! I am so glad I gave this group a look and will be watching all available shows.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Jack's newest album.  I listened to it in its entirety 4 times the first day it was delivered.  I recommend it to all of his fans!!
B004IYWN7C|1.0|A few minutes is all it took for us to realize this wasn't something we wanted our 6 and below kids watching.  If the first couple of scenes are representative of the whole movie, I would say that watching this movie would not be an enriching experience in any way for people of any age.  Low-brow, slightly lewd, devoid of spirit.
B0033YAU3M|1.0|While this review is not for the book's contents or the leather book displayed, I am peeved to place an order for one thing and receive something entirely different. I received  a hardback book that is in rough condition with tears on the hardback cover and also water stains. This is not at all what I expected when I ordered a leather back book, and instead receive what appears to be a library reject.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game provides a fun challenge that leaves me wanting more. The sesonal and limeted edition items add a nice touch.
B003IDMUVI|3.0|You could predict the ending ... Must read for plot build up and narration,,, Grisham is master in details and judiciary
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This is a classic that should be watched at the beginning of the Christmas season. Believe in the magic of Christmas!
B007ZXK08C|1.0|I didnt like it at all - I hate American-writing, I should have looked into it a little more before I purchased it!  Obviously very modern American language, I only read a couple of chapters, thought the language quite disgusting. Not even worth the one star I had to give it!
0345806786|5.0|I haven't read it yet but I'm sure if it's better than the book and has some of the inside details from the dark tower then I'll love it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Once I opened the app and got started. I would be on it for at least an hour, trying to get as far as I could on the competing part of the game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read it for a second time. I love that you can visualize the characters and the capital events.<br />Going to read the third one again as well.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A great piece written by Card! It kept me wanting to read more and more. One of the better page-turners I've read so far!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Let me begin by saying that I am not a fan of Max Brooks' original book. I won't go into why, as this a review of the Brad Pitt and Marc Foster film adaptation. I am, however, an aficionado of the zombie genre. Unfortunately, as my review title states, this is not really a zombie movie, but rather a disaster film where the disaster is a zombie plague.<br /><br />I will start with what I did enjoy. The pace for much of the film is very fast, and the movie is all the better for it. The viewer has just enough time to catch his breath in between action sequences before Pitt's UN super-agent character is flung to another corner of the globe in search of a solution to the zombie outbreak. That doesn't leave much time or room for characterization of anyone involved, but that's pretty irrelevant in this kind of high-concept, big budget production. There's also the occasional silly dialogue between characters, but again, I feel that's somewhat expected in this type of movie. As a veteran film watcher, I am somewhat jaded when it comes to action movies (as I sometimes think I've \\"seen it all\\" by now), but a few of the action scenes are actually quite thrilling. Unfortunately, these minor high points really aren't enough to make me enjoy this film. So on to the bad...<br /><br />For a movie about zombies, World War Z is amazingly bloodless. I know it is a PG-13 film, but studios are getting away with some pretty graphic stuff these days in PG-13 productions (recall the bloody massacre of teens and pre-teens in The Hunger Games, for example). In other words, this movie has no guts (no pun intended). It's \\"violence\\" is bland, bloodless, and toothless. I personally don't enjoy violence for violence's sake in any form of media, but I feel it's essential in a film like this to add tension and remind the viewer in very visceral terms of what's at stake if the protagonist fails in his quest.<br /><br />That leads me to my next major issue: the zombies themselves. Few of the World WarZ zombies are particularly terrifying in their appearance. They growl, hiss, and movie quickly when agitated, but if you're expecting the wonderfully creative makeup and practical effects of the zombies you see in the Walking Dead show (which has a far smaller budget compared to World War Z's $190 million) you'll be sorely disappointed. The undead in this movie by and large don't look much scarier then people you see riding on public transportation at 2:00 AM. Also, there is a general overuse of CGI. CGI, in my opinion, is best left for wide shot, large scale scenes where practical effects would be unmanageable. World War Z does indeed use the technology in this way, but you see it used almost as frequently in close up and medium shots. In these latter cases, the zombies often look cartoonish and fake.<br /><br />My final issue with World War Z is the much-discussed final act of the film, which was re-written and re-shot during post-production. It fails to match the frenetic pace of the earlier part of the movie, and has more than a few eye roll-inducing sequences (the hero stepping on shattered glass at the worst time cliche, a rather obnoxious Pepsi product placement, etc.) These kind of films often struggle to tie up their stories in a believable manner, and World War Z is no different.<br /><br />I was often reminded of the disaster film 2012 as I watched World War Z, with its similarly globetrotting plot in response to destructive forces of nature (one character even refers to the zombie plague as such). World War Z is far less silly and insulting to the intelligence of the viewer, at least. Still, that should give you an idea as to what you might be getting into with this film. If that's what you're looking for, you may enjoy it. If you're looking for something along the lines of 28 Days Later or Walking Dead, this is not for you.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Enjoyed the entire book. Kept me interested the entire time I was reading. If you like Baldacci you will enjoy this book.

B0014J8D9Q|2.0|A movie that pretends to be different.  Yes, Eastwood is a drunk in the movie, yes, he is old, but in the end he still kills all the bad guys.  When he was younger he did it with more style.  The movie is boring and pretentious.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed every page. Recommend! Quick read and could not put down. Grisham is the master at legal twists and turns.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Very nice period drama and set at a good steady pace. I liked the theme music as well. Well done.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Brook's book is a scathing indictment of the ills of the world this day in September of 2013.  Terrorist, royalty seeking millionaires, science without morals - whatever.  Gives survivakists a bible for the future or a suicide note to bbe left for.....
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great show! Family friendly and interesting characters and story lines. It reminds me of how American family TV used to be. Life brings issues. People are people. The characters work through their issues and grow relationships. And fathers, mothers and families are portrayed in a positive light!
B008MM9630|4.0|Fun but does want you to buy stuff and I won't.  Wish you could do more for free with the game and had more energy.
B00C2FFJFM|2.0|The seller of this CD was fine but we disliked the CD itself.  I bought this for my 9 year old and she and I both disliked it.  We liked the song that was popular but played to death on the radio - &#34;if you're ready come and get it ....&#34; but the rest of the songs were really annoying.  She asked me to take the CD off of her ipod and that's pretty bad!  We like the new Demi Lovato CD a lot better.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Purchased this app over six months ago and still play it all the time. The game updates always add something exciting and  challenging.
B00BLSJI80|4.0|I bought my daughter 3 new CDs and this was her favorite!  Demi is growing up to be a mature young lady who doesn't feel the need to be inappropriate or risque in order to sell music.  She has a great voice and catchy music.  My girls and I enjoy her music.

B002QNTNL6|5.0|I love watching this movie over and over, although I realize that it's pure fantasy.  Amanda Bynes is terrific in this movie, and I wish her all the best in her personal life.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really enjoy this game though I feel like there is some need to know info out there on how to obtain certain items that are needed before progressing.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Thank God I read this book in my twenties and not 40 years from now. I will begin speaking my husband's love languages right away! The profiles at the end were especially helpful because my husband didn't have to read the book for me to discover his love language. He is bilingual and both were surprising to me!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Great take on a zombie flick. Good story line and great acting. Intense and action packed from start to finish.

B000W9399S|4.0|Fantastic story that pokes fun at traditional fantasy themes, written with humor and wit to spare. You should try it.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|makes one feel good all over. The main character's philosophy is refreshing. I enjoyed it tremendously and this site keeps telling me I have to say more
0062511408|5.0|I was privileged to have the chance to read such a marvelous book. Since the very beginning, this book caught y attention and I finished reading it within a few days. At this time I was only 7 years old. Now, I just started my first year of graduate work and still enjoy going through the chapters that drove my aspirations to become who I am. It is a very motivating book and will encourage you to follow your personal dreams. It will also encourage you fight for your dreams for you to make them come true. Enjoy your reading!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Intense, dramatic, thrilling, awesome, one of the best shows i have ever followed, more more more. Just sucks you in.
B00B6U63ZE|4.0|The book is ok - some good points etc - however a lot can be boiled down to make a 90 day plan and communicate. a few good ideas etc - however could (from my point of view) have covered most in a 10 page article. would recommend the book for flipping through - especially if you do not change job that often.
0788859544|5.0|My daughter was a very happy girl when this came in the mail this week. She loves this movie and its very hard to find right now.
B0073XW096|4.0|This is a great book. You can use it to help your class create different stories. They will love to create
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|I've seen it before and just wanted to remember how it went. I do like the actor and the action in this type of police line. I haven't finished watching them as yet. So much to see, so little time, LOL...I think you'll like it.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|It was a DVD, and it worked.  Go team!  Why review a movie on here, if you bought it, you must have done some research to see if you'd like it...
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very good book. Always very funny books by Jeff Kinney. I recommend you read this book. It will always keep you entertained. It's one of those books you can never put down. 2 thumbs up for Jeff Kinney!

B00F91SCXC|3.0|Of course, the book was better.  The story line in the movie has no relation to the book.  But it was a fun waste of time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a superior work. The stories expertly intertwined and the characters are easy to relate to. I recommend this book to all walks of life.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|This is David Baldacci as you would expect. If you are familiar with Oliver Stone and the Camel Club, this book won't disappoint.  If you are looking for Earnest Hemingway or F. Scott Fitzgerald, you will be let down.  This is very much in the Tom Clancy genre and while I don't think Baldacci is as good as Patterson, I do enjoy his work as a quick read, national security type thriller.
B00594XOZU|1.0|ok when I got this app I thought it would work but when I tried to get it said. This app is taking longer than it should try again in a bit .if it doesn't work for the kindle fire than make it to or don't have it on the app store.
B00ELU79ZO|2.0|Let me begin this review by saying that I am a huge Megadeth fan and own almost everything they have ever released.  I have also seen them live on the same tour that this video was shot for. Ok, let's get into it. There are no extras or bonus material. It's just the concert. If you purchased this from Best Buy, at least you get the live CD to go with it. Next, the video picture quality and performance was really good, not great. Having such bright video screens behind the players makes it hard to see the actual band members during the performance. This was a huge problem in the actual live show too. The worst part of this, and the part that made it almost unwatchable, was the fact that what you see and what you hear are two different things. What you see is a completely different performance than what you hear. You don't have to watch too closely to notice that when you hear the drummer do something, but what you see is something else... Something is wrong. Now, live, Shawn is not a great drummer, in fact he is downright basic and boring to both watch and to listen to. However, in the studio, he sounds pretty good. Not sure if it's him or he is being told to keep things simple so others can shine. Whatever the case, the audio of his playing sounds pretty good, but watching it is bad. It's not the same at all. The vocal have been overdubbed and I am pretty sure the guitars have been too. My guess is that they recorded the audio \\"Live In The Studio\\" and placed it over the video. This is actually rather common, just not for each member.  Watch Dave's lips and voice sounds and the distance he is from the mic. It doesn't match. All of this makes this a pretty sloppy release.  Personally I would like to make it so that if the live performance you are seeing or hearing has been tampered with or modified in any way, that package should have a warning label. Hope this helps!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Wonderful plot with memorable characters  many facts are as I<br />Remember them from childhood. A five star read ..Looking forward to the next book
B003NS2T9G|2.0|I thought this might be an interesting series to watch but it seems to be headed for every campy SciFi theme that I ever saw from the 1960's. Gas that is alive (was't that on the original Star Trek series?), a cyborg that looks like it was designed by a kid going through adolescence, and on and on. I kept hoping it was going to improve but it hasn't yet after 5 episodes so I guess this is what the whole series is like. That is too bad. Better writing could have made this one interesting.
B000JMKSE2|4.0|Lots of details.<br />Probably more than I ever wanted to know but very well written.<br />Shows that the author really understands the material.<br />It's a lesson in new world economics.<br />The things we thought were true are no longer true.<br />It's a great lesson for online sellers such as myself.<br />I recommend it.
B000HL2J0G|4.0|I remember watching this series as a kid and I loved it. Watching some of the episodes now, holds my interest just as well to see what he can invent to overcome his problems. This is the original think out of the box, make a bulldozer out of paper clips kind of guy. Richard Dean Anderson pulls it off well.
B00D2PIUAM|5.0|Despite the poor charting and mixed reviews \\"Loud Like Love\\" has garnered, it is without a doubt Placebo's best studio album since 2003's \\"Sleeping With Ghosts.\\" The album captures the band's essence in a way \\"Meds\\" and \\"Battle for the Sun\\" simply couldn't. \\"B3\\", the EP from 2012 promised a return to the band's more authentic sound, and \\"Loud Like Love\\" delivers. A must-have for fans, and a great introductory album for new listeners.
0871137380|5.0|i would recommend watching the movie and then reading the book. the book gives way more detail of the battle and the soldiers who fought it. i was addicted to this book, i read it every chance i had free time. following this book i read Sua Sponte by dick couch. that book chronicles what it takes to become a ranger, which made me appreciate black hawk down even more. being an ex-soldier i admire great stories of the bravery and camaraderie of our elite warriors, cause i know i'm a big wuss and could never be one.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|This to me is the best live performance The Beach Boys have ever performed. All of the songs are well done and this audio cd along with the dvd version make for great entertainment.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|This direction for Paramore is absolutely dynamic!  The band digs deep into the 80's & 90's alternative pop sounds to produce a variegated energized set of songs!  Recalling the ethereality of Harriet Wheeler's (of The Sundays) lilting vocals to the poignant punk/ska blend of No Doubt, Hayley Williams transcends the pop genre with subtle stylings full of energy, vibrancy, emotion, and virtuosity!  Truly a band that has much more in store for the future!!
0553386794|5.0|By far, this is the one of the best fantasy works I've read in recent years. If you like the show, you will LOVE the books even more. It adds more depth to the characters and there is so much more I understand than just what they show on HBO.<br /><br />I love how GRRM's mind works...you have to be a genius to imagine and write all this. I finished this book in 4 days (If I didn't have work, I would have stayed up all day and night and never put it down!). The characters are amazing and the plot is full of twists and turns...yes, it is long like the Lord of Rings but is just as amazing to read! I can't recommend this book and the series enough.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Everyone should read this book. It is a great way to understand the mental and physical requirements and the trials and tribulations of war, life and basics of what people go through everyday.  Not just the military but anyone that has to deal with death and destruction whether at home or abroad!!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|All the other reviews summarise eloquently why this book is a great read, but let me simply add two observations:<br /><br />the writing and imagery are extremely evocative, and when combined with a narrative that really moves at a brisk pace, makes for one awesome read. Highly recommended.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I watched this because it has all of my favorite actors in it. Thought it would be just a love story but it is so very much more.
B002W7H3EA|4.0|A classic. Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock combine for the expected classic production. Entertaining, fun, very well done. Highly recommended.
B006K1IIHA|1.0|I'm a long-time Amazon customer and Prime member and I am completely baffled by Amazon's terrible product labeling and customer service on this Blu-Ray. I bought this as a birthday gift for my wife, and when we put it in we found that it won't work on our Blu-Ray player, even though there's no region-specific info about this disc in the description and it was bought through Amazon.com, not Amazon.co.uk. What's even better is that I bought it 36 days ago and we just now put it in to watch it to discover that it won't play - and since it's been more than 30 days, Amazon won't give us the option to return this item because it's been more than 30 days, even though it's defective.<br /><br />Really annoyed at wasting money on this and at Amazon's crummy service for this purchase.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my grandson loves this game.  it is all he ever wants to play.  great fun. we saw the movie despicable me2 and then it was REALLY a hit.  i don't play but he sure does - a lot!
B00EZZ77ZM|5.0|Everything you'd expect from a Jack Johnson album. If you're a fan, you'll love this album. There isn't one song I skip over.
B0067RQYNW|1.0|To hard to use on smart phone.not enouhjj clip art options.  Would not use it on phone. I would have nous for it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game for children of all ages. This is a very addictive colorful game that you and your whole family will love.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|It was good but not great. What I call great is reserved for movies of the caliber like the Avengers and Star Trek
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|I love board games and so I tried this one as the FAOTD. It is like playing the real board game. I tried the first three (out of 5) difficulty levels and the 3rd one was the first one where I started to loose a game. So it feels pretty balanced if you play against the AI. I love the fact that you can play with 2 players and with real dices. You can enable or disable the multiplier dice, graphics are really good and the UI is fast. No waiting for AI or loading or anything. No crazy permissions as well.<br /><br />Great job to the developer! Thank you and keep up the good work!<br /><br />One additional feature that I would like to see is online multiplayer. That would be awesome. Other than that it's just perfect.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This move was really really great, not just good, BUT GREAT! The whole story of a good guy wprking as a bad guy and then proving to be a real hero. now that is great
B002BVOYBW|5.0|For its time, such a great film.  I did notice some flaws in it, but still such a great film.  The only thing, though, is that although the more weird characters are very likeable, I wouldn't recommend necessarily considering them your ultimate role models.  Just because unfortunately society isn't geared to work that way.  But, for a little while, under of course, controlled circumstances and a safe two hour learning experience, it can be both very fun as well as beneficial to a person, to be crazy.  :)
B003U4ZOQ8|4.0|I loved the suspense and it kept me so interested that I hated when I finished the 6th. season ..
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Used on kindle fire an  cell phone, very usefull indeed. Had apps that is didn't know we're goin  to the ad card.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Amazing.  Loved the new point of views.  Can't get enough.  On to the next book can't wait for more from dany and Jon.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am very happy with the app. I can balance my checkbook or anything else I need a calculator for. Big numbers so you don't have to squint to see what the answer is.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|This app is ok but if you have slACKED YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS APP TO ADD A SKACH SO THIS APP IS OK IF YOU WANT IT FOR SKACH
B005DD7H50|5.0|Even though no drug like this exists, it's kool to see smart ppl act. I love seeing fast thinking, smart acting roles
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It was okay but it was not great seemed like there was a lot of running around and not much more
B000HKYBXA|5.0|This is quite brilliant! Kenneth. Brannagh has done the modern world a great servic with all his screen Shakespeare adaptions and this one is the best! A must see!
B00EM7XRSY|5.0|This takes me back to high school when this first came out.  It was the second Maiden album that I heard and it just seemed to get better and better.  I can listen to this album front to back and never get tired of it.  Even used the cover for an art project.
B0044IABFS|5.0|This is an awesome show, I promise you will love it. Cried my eyes out watching the very last episode
B009WUAK2M|3.0|hard to say, don't think you can put any more cheesy lines into a single film. I must say hearing chuck norris tell a chuck norris joke was pretty funny.
B000SVZIOE|5.0|My 3 year old loves this movie and has watched it many, many times. Fun characters and a good story.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|As a musician I have spent a fair amount of time exploring the roots of our heritage... This movie taught me how much I really do not know... An excellent documentary for anyone searching out where the real sound comes from... Great clips and history... A wonderful documentary by any measurement
B003MC5N28|5.0|Wish I had read this book as a Young Adult. Even as an adult reader, I couldn't put it down.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|A glimpse of a world gone mad from different points of view.  An enjoyable read of what is to come.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|This is some cheap knock off I put it on and it says I can't go on it to much space taken that's the only game I have God
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this show and wish I had started watching years ago.  Now I'm trying to watch four seasons as quickly as possible since season 5 is starting soon.
B005LAII3A|4.0|This is a great action adventure with super special effects and acting. I really enjoyed the fast paced chase scenes and over the top fight sequences. Thank you.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|its so fun to play no giltches nothing bad I cant believe they made SOOO GOOD just wow its all I have to say just WOW!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Aslan writes a respectful and fascinating book. He nicely historically situates the faith of the Christ-followers without pushing an agenda (either for or against Christianity).
B00A8ECU24|4.0|A lot of the ponies you need to get require you to either spend a long time playing or spend money to get it.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Once you start... you can't stop. Very challenging app, good for your brain. Early levels are simple, then it gets harder.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|it is a really good app and its really helpful I use it all the tiime and you should get it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Fascinating story of some time and place yet to be discovered, but soon to be revealed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Continuation of a great series! Rhe actors and actresses are talented! I can't wait for season four to start soon!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I've watched this season over and over again so many times I can't even count. Joss Whedons masterpiece. When you watch this, they are like family. This is the most perfect theory on how civilization is going to go. And I hope to end up on a Firefly.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|This app is an okay app. I loved this app on my sister's Ipod but when it came on kindle I was disappointed because I figured out that the plane and moose levels were broken. Also he puke level or hit or miss but most times miss. However all of the other levels work fine so I gave this app about 3-3.5 rating.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best season yet. So many twists and turns at the Abby. Trial and triumph, and a compelling look at how life used to be such a short time ago.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Uplifting and tear-enduing, this novel is an emotional adventure.  Loved the characters and their depth.  Loved the switched point of views.
B00E3D7WGU|1.0|When i received this DVD it was already opened in the box.  There was no plastic seal.  After the first 2 minutes, I knew I was watching a bootleg copy.  Both the sound quality and picture quality were terrible.  I returned it the next day for a full refund.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I highly recommend this book. It was such a great story with great characters. I read through it very quickly wanting to know what would happen but fearing what was going to happen too.
1594202273|1.0|This is one of the most frustrating and difficult books I have ever read. It is full of sometimes interesting stories of almost exploded nukes on US soils. However, these are disorganized, apparently purposefully, into fragments which seem to have been shuffled, like a deck of cards throughout the book. One story begins and is interrupted, only to start another and another . . . etc. Yes, it needs an editor -- badly.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Not far in but seems like fun.  As usual they want you to buy things that make the game easier.  I particularly dislike the fact that you have to sit and watch the nursery while it is providing a baby.  Maybe there is a way around that. Does require internet connection to run. Seems like it might get repetitive pretty quickly but I'll just have to wait and see.<br />Do like the idea of breeding crossovers to get other animals.
B00138KFYO|4.0|When you are rebuilding your music collection (again) piece at a time why not start at the top.  To have some of Janis's greatest hits reproduced in good digital quality  for me to play back anytime well worth it. I spend enough on coffee.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Love this show so much!! The whole cast does outstanding work in this show. Very scientifically intriguing stuff! A must see
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series is fun to read, exciting, feels like a future that we are rapidly approaching. Reading it will also help you in following the movie series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very well done with excellent setting, plot and timeline. The cast takes you back in time to tell the story where you feel like a part of it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very good game for all people. I enjoy playing this game. I told many of my friends about it. They also enjoy it to.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the app is great. you will love it. good graphics and good types of horses. fun competing and winning the medals
B0093QHWLC|5.0|Gripping and beautiful story.  I usually watch only 1/2 of a movie each of 2 nights but this was so good I watched it straight through.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a fun game.  good way to test your mind.  i play this game a lot.  i would suggest this game.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is great. It has every feature that I need and is extremely simple to use. I recommend it highly.
B003SI7SRE|4.0|Another switched body movie, this one though has a very funny side to it, R. Schneider put a lot of work into being able to pull off a popular teenage high school cheerleader. Good stuff.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The best read I've had in years! Haven't my teeth into anything that qualifies as literature. This read as some the best. Every major character developed into the complex creatures we are.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Very nicely made kids movie. Our whole family enjoyed it! We rented it for my grandkids. Very funny! Very cute!
B0058YPL66|3.0|The precept is a good one, and the Fairy Tale Land sequences are usually interesting and well done. I like the way the writers have woven together the fairy tales into a whole society, with the characters interacting with each other.<br /><br />When, however, it gets to &#34;our&#34; world, it's another story. I can sum up almost all the episodes as &#34;Emma is confused and the mayor wins in the end.&#34; Come on, give us some glimmer of hope here - episode after episode, the good guys get squashed. I searched the internet for episode synopses and found out that it gets better, or the whole box would have been put up for sale.
B000I9VOO4|5.0|Awesome, most excellent film. It carefully touches on issues that were considered &#34; a tinder box&#34; during that era. We were required to read the book in early high school but didn't really understand the impact until many years later after seeing the movie.  It is truly a classic.  A must watch.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|The game Cubistry is fun ... however, the settings are, seem, very limited ... could never turn the complete sound off ... play on my Kindle when the tv is on and do not want any noise distracting rest of family ... so, unfortunately, ended up deleting the game.  Disappointed ...
B00ET47USI|4.0|Go ahead and get it. you can learn how to set up the game with real playing cards. I just wish there was a bigger choice of animations.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|We really loved the movie and enjoyed all the twists and turns in the plot. Lots of action visual effects.
B00DWZHTOU|4.0|This one even kept me in the dark as to how the 4 magicians managed the 3 illusions.  The ending was really a big surprise, I never saw it coming or who the 5th Horseman was.  Kept me interested the entire movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is one game that you can play again and again<br />Before you know it time Flys bye seems like you only just begun !!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Very entertaining with a great cast. Left you wanting sal sequel. Love the illusions and how it tied into the overall plot line.
B00F5F0208|4.0|Its another Drake album.  He went in on this one.  Lotta feeling behind it.  Good beats....thought out lyrics.  Its a keeper.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|From the very beginning, to the very end, I was on edge! Excellent movie and innovative camera angles. This movie far surpassed my expectations, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a classical suspense movie!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have read thousands of books in my life. None quite like this. That's saying something. This book speaks from a dark place in modern history. During WWII in Nazi Germany, a young girl discovers words and life in a time and place where words were used as weapons of warfare and lives systematically burned and thrown away.<br />Even in darkness, there's always light. There is love and humour  that shines even in the grim reality of this period. That's why you should read this book
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I can't stop playing. I cried tears of joy when I saw this game. It's so cruel and adorable at the same time. I keep singing the song it's so catchy
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Really liked the progression of Danny Torrance.  The book isn't really scary, it's more a \\"here's what happened next\\" kind of feel. Not real crazy about the family twist but that is the only complaint I have.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|this show is great the plot is amazing keeps you wanting more and more give it a try you will love it
B009IF82SK|5.0|Great show. The laughs keep on coming, even after 6 seasons. Hopefully they continue with the awesome writing. Must buy.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|A little slow, and predictable, but once you invest so much in a story and its characters it's hard not to love it.  Now I am lost and hopeless with no Winds of Winter to read.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|It is nice to have this so you can watch the videos you love that aren't  available through the stores.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found it hard to stop reading  these books are real page turners the stories are not all about the sex but digs deep into how our personalities are developed at a very young age
0062206281|5.0|I love this book and this writer.  There's no one like him.  It's mysterious and magical at once.  Great characters.  It is a sequel to my favorite book, THE SHADOW OF THE WIND.  Just love it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Keeps you interested. Great Date Night show for couples who don't get to go out much. We both love it :)
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Loving this game. Won't say my age but this game has beautiful graphics and it has given me a challenge .
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King at his finest. He is mellowing in his later years and doesn't write a tale so much to scare, more one to entertain and remind me of my youth.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband & I were not sure if we would like the British show, but we are in season 2 & we are enjoying it very much!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Ive been streaming media on my iPad and iPhone. So to make use of my TV I opted to get the chromecast over the more expensive options. I have been extremely pleased with the HD quality video and the ease of use.<br /><br />Set up was quite easy. It plugs into your HDMI on your TV and powers throughy a USB on the TV or the supplied power adapter. You go to the setup online amd it will walk you through the setup on your wifi network and you will be off and running.<br /><br />It took a bit of getting used to using the iPad or iPhone to control what I'm watching but overall its simple to use and the best bang for the buck.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season two was very interesting. Some of the plot was a bit disappointing. When will lady Edith ever find happiness?
B00985E3UG|5.0|I saw this book and had to read it.  I now understand why it is so hard to get myself on the right track.  I have studied many healthy ways and believe I have every tool to eat well.  There by staying healthy.  It has still been a struggle to keep my weight down. I now understand all the studies and money that goes into  aiding  my down fall.  With the information from this book I think I will be more aware of the choices I make. After all, it is my choice as to what I eat and serve my family. Thank you Michael Moss for this eye opening book.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I read the Power first, then the Magic........applying  the principals of Love and Gratitude have changed my life! More things to be grateful for everyday......the more I am grateful the more I am given......it really works just like Rhonda says!!!!!!!!!!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Despite the multiple story lines keeps you engaged, I was always anxious to find out where the characters would end up next....
B00846REIS|5.0|This series of books were amazing and I am counting down the days till book 4 is released!!! You can't put these books down
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Started watching the series starting with season one on amazon prime, had watched the Next generation when it first came out in the 90's here and there when I could catch a show decided to start with season one and watch all the shows in chronological order (has taken years) been interesting how the characters relations have been weaved together and grown through out the series season 4 the writing lost it way but I thought that season 5 came back strong and the writing was back on track with the original theme of the shows characters and story line again great writing and story telling.
B0073COMUW|4.0|Light is much brighter than expected.  I would've bought a softer color if I had it to do over again, but these are great for what I'm using them for.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Many disparaged this movie as a burlesque of the heroic- a mindless slugfest of ridiculous proportions. While there is some truth to both allegations, the achievement remains astonishing- for the first time in living memory, the epically gargantuan scale required by city-crushing, parkway dwarfing characters becomes believable. Every scene has subtle reminders of relative size that constantly reference the scale of the robots and monsters involved- until the impossible becomes so ingrained that when the finale rolls, a complete suspension of disbelief has taken place. The plot is a skeletal framework supporting an absolute feast of eye candy which may well set fire to a fading genre founded by stop-frame animation, elaborate scale models and actors in rubber suits. Pacific Rim never forgets the fact that monster movies are supposed to be entertainment; this movie neatly avoids all the pitfalls which destroyed the latest effort to reprise King Kong- the overweening complexity, the misguided effort to explore the gaping flaws in human ethics, and so on, and so forth. It's an endlessly engaging brawl with a few dashes of heroic angst and a dripping scoop of silliness that never stops. Some of the professional reviewers were apparently expecting a dainty serving of veal cordon bleu with an elegant garnish- and they were disappointed when they got a gooey banana split of unprecedented proportions, topped by a mutant maraschino cherry bigger than a basketball. Too bad, so sad- dig in, kids! This is great stuff if you have any affinity at all for monster movies.
B0058SNIC6|3.0|They are comfy but doesn't fit the way I had hoped due to the lack of half sizes. Also quite sweaty:(
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman has done it again. Another delightful trip down the rabbit hole. I am just sad that this story is over.
B009LHWEKW|4.0|They sure now how to stretch out a story. Still like the characters .  Trying to guess what they are going to do for last season.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I received a new kindle fire and got one great game also. I have played lots of games and this is at the top of the list. Makes you think and then think again.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Spoofey and occasionally funny.  I think I purchased it because it was only $1.99.  Like most &#34;dollar movies&#34; it was worth the time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I would recommend it to women friends, kept you guessing. Could not put it down. Read the book in one sitting.  It was very moving.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Super read.  I love the way Follett brings his characters to life in an early 20th century setting.  I plan to read the next 2 installments of this trilogy.  Great book that is hard to put down.
B00519YRH2|5.0|I just introduced my 10 and 12 yr olds to BIG and they loved it! My 10-yr-old has since watched it 2 more times on her own!
0545626382|5.0|Yep, I was reluctant to read these books, but my wife has read them three times already. I have to say they are deserving of all the hype. Not just for kids, these are young adults books that can be enjoyed by adults and I certainly enjoyed them a great deal. Very well written, wonderful characters, very original dystopic future reality. Very good books. The author just nails it again and again chapter after chapter, and it only gets better until the very end. It doesn't resolve the way you want to, you want more, and that's also a good sign, and it makes you keep thinking about what would come next. Not many books or films do that for me these days, I can count a handful that have successfully left me in their world exploring well after the book or movie is over sometimes weeks after, and this trilogy is one of them. To me that's a mark of a very powerful and deep imagination with such a skillfully and completely crafted and relevant world, filled with poignant and in reality timely messages.<br /><br />After-all lets face it, western society today is not all that far off from the twisted and diabolically sickened culture of the Capitol in every sense - from fashion to politics and the mindless senseless ignorant messages of pop culture television; obsessions with idiotic unimportant stupidities, and lets not forget the hideous creatures that appear on some of these pop shows are just a bit of eye liner and hair dye away from the vacuous insidious sycophancy of the capitol elites. This includes of course most television presenters, news presenters and other people who have no idea what they are talking about and don't care, but just read from the script on the teleprompter while they relish wallowing in their ignorance and their part in the dissemination of it. We are lied to routinely by the \\"leaders\\" who are every bit as sadistic as President Snow and his minions perhaps very much more so in some ways.<br /><br />In the west, we live in the Capitol, too afraid tostand up and speak truth to power lest we lose our sacred gadgets and luxury lifestyles. We're told we have freedom by try protesting something the government doesn't want protested outside the White House. Try taking a photo of a Federal Reserve building while a tourist on holiday with your kids. Here in the Capitol of the West sycophancy and narcissism run wild, coupled with potent psychopathy that concentrates the closer to the central echelons of power you get. Meanwhile children are murdered and sacrificed with drone bombings and unlawful wars and \\"military kinetic actions\\"; scandal after scandal covered up by a new piece of nonsense courtesy of an utterly belly-draggingly servile corporate media.<br /><br />Most of the population of the world lives as the population of the districts live - varying degrees of poverty and starvation. Of course in our case, rather than such an overt oppression as carried out by the Capitol against the Districts in the Hunger Games series, our \\"leaders\\" and the whole western system keeps the third world impoverished and under the thumb through the financial system centered in DC. Civil Liberties are given lip service when suitable to the leaders and driven over rough-shod when suitable, all at their discretionary whim - a false promise touted out for parade when useful, nothing more. The only thing holding it all in some kind of unbalanced equilibrium is the threat of the people waking up, rising up but not any kind of moral dictate or ethical concerns on part of the \\"leaders\\". As it is in the Capitol.<br /><br />If it were not for the entirely anti-capitalist anti-freedom system propagated by the United States through the privately owned federal reserve and it's tentacles on Wall Street (Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan et al) then capitalism would have spread worldwide and all those third world states would have organically raised their conditions. Instead, artificial oppression by the owners of the World Bank - primarily the Rothschild dynasty - sucker these poor nations into debts they are never supposed to repay except with resources, land, and political freedoms. See the book \\"confessions of an economic hit man\\" if you want an insider report on how this works and how they are every bit as cunning, sadistic and evil as those who sought to hold on to power in the Hunger Games. Look at what happened to UN Arms inspector David Kelly when he did not agree that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction - he had a nice walk in the woods and had a nice \\"suicide by falling asleep\\". Rather convenient. Look at Michael Hastings, Rolling Stone Editor who alerted Wikileaks and his family members that he had a massive story that would expose the United States military, told them \\"I'm being chased by the Feds, I'm going into hiding for a while\\" and his modern mercedes exploded according to eye witnesses. The media says he ran into a tree even though video footage has been recovered from a nearby cafe clearly showing the vehicle exploding. Neighbors report the LAPD was at his house days before the murder looking under his car. Look at how Bradley Manning and Julian Assange are treated and the corporate narrative that tries to bury global heros under mountains of excrement. Look at how Manning was imprisoned for years for exposing *crimes* committed by the state. Not national secrets, but crimes. Unlawful activities he not only had a right to expose to the people, but a duty. Too many in the Capitol cheer for the crimes of the state, herald them as markers of freedom and expressions of power. Might is Right. All these ignorant fallacious paradigms coalescing into a hideous harmony of destruction corruption, murder, war and oppression celebrated by the participant masses. Other examples of this psychopathy being expressed are the way the US blocked air travel over Puerto Rico to the Venezuelan presidential plane recently, and at US request Morales, president of Bolivia, had his plane grounded because he could not fly over Europe, just because he was verbally supportive of Edward Snowdens plight. Message: Stand up against the Western power monopoly and no matter who you are - president or pauper - you will be crushed. Spiteful petty political retaliations by psychopathic, *pathetic* leaders, no better than President Snow, who are playing *games* with the world and who see all of us, every single one of us, as pawns in their hunger games. Millions starve every year to feed the west while we buy all the world grain supplies to feed to animals so we can eat animals instead of plants, raising the price of grain on the world market, and literally leading to the direct starving of so many.<br /><br />Monsanto and Dupont and organisations like DARPA and their public offshoots create biological atrocities from New Zealand to Costa Rica. It's only a few decades away that they will be able to create mutts of all kinds, just like the books. And who is to stop them, those creations are automatically militarized. Monsanto is publicly vandalizing the genetic heritage of the planet while studies prove their genetically modified organisms propagate in the wild, cause infertility in countless animal studies, cancer, and all manner of infirmities.<br /><br />So again, we don't live in a world that far from the Hungar Games. Hopefully enough people can see that we are too close for comfort, but far away enough to change course peacefully and through political activity and intellectual renaissance but it's up to the people. I hope the Hunger Games wakes up a new generation of young adults to the political realities. Maybe it was not intended as such an allegory but even if not, the connections are there.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This is a wonderful book, rich in detail and intrigue. I couldn't stop reading once I'd begun!  Delightful plot twists and turns take the reader on a joyful journey.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King has definitely done it again!!  I have read all of his books, seen all his movies. The Shining was one of my favorites if not THE one!  I have never been disappointed in his works!  If you have not had the opportunity to read The Shining, DO!  If you have, do not miss Doctor Sleep!!!  You will be AMAZED!  Thank you Mr. King!!!  Wish I could give it way more than 5 stars.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|First of all -- LOVED, LOVED the film. It was my summer's guilty pleasure; i.e., saw multiple times in the theatre. Yeah, Quinto was a little weepy, but Pegg was pugnacious and Pine was perfect and Greenwood was gallant and Cumberbatch was criminally colossal.<br /><br />So that made it even worse when I received my pre-release package that was stuffed with all sorts of disk options (Bluray, DVD, 3D). I popped my Bluray disk into the player and immediately went to Special Features since, of course, I'd seen the film multiple times already and what I really wanted was the story behind the story. And since there were SO many disks there had to be SO many features, right?<br /><br />So what I really wanted was commentary. Not there. (What? No commentary!!!???) What I really wanted was a gag reel. Nope. What I really wanted were more interviews with cast members. Nah, not there either.<br /><br />Didn't get any of that. Were all the typical features hidden as Easter Eggs? Were they on here but I couldn't find them?<br /><br />It wasn't until I read other reviews that I realized what was going on. I wasn't imagining things. If movie studios are going to make consumers figure out which release and which disk and which vendor and which feature package to buy before buying (which is *really* hard to do in a pre-order situation because you don't get all the details), serves them right if sales fall -- and they should.<br /><br />So, don't buy this disk, especially if you've already seen the film and what you really want is the story behind the story. 'Cuz you won't get it. Wish I could say where else to buy but it's too confusing. Check the other reviews; some of them have done a great job at explaining what's where.<br /><br />Shame on Paramount. They broke our ship.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I loved Firefly! It was such a refreshing change of pace, and it has a good balance of quirkiness, humor, and action.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I love it! I was hooked from the first episode and of course all the hoopla surrounding this great show
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is really good book. I read it in less than an hour, and it left me wanting more. In a good way. Tesla in an amazing guy to read about! I have been wanting to read about him, so that's why I picked this one. It has an abbreviated story of his life...that's why I wanted more. It is a very entertaining read, and am goin to recommend it to a few of my buddies. My wife picked it as the book of her turn to read in our 2persons book club. I finished it before she has, and can't wait to talk it over with her! I thank this author for the book. Maybe he can do a 2nd edition that's twice as long. It's put together nicely. I have always been a fan of imagination and this book is now in my resources to back that up. Thanks guy. READ IT ALREADY! Ha. Thanks again.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I liked how it tied up all the loose ends. Surprising how it ends.  I will miss this series. Awesome.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The kids love this game and so do I. Be careful its addicting!!! If you don't like being addicted to games you may want to play something else!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am so please with this app! I wasn't expecting much but a few friends told me about it and were just raving. I used this on my Kindle Fire and I just love the reading plans, bookmarks, highlighting and daily reminders. It's really helped me keep up with my daily reading of the word and I can't imagine not having it now!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I've always liked Julianna Margualis and Chris Noth, but this show made me love them. I love Will and Diane, plus Cary. Great show, gets better with every season
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A cute story that was just long enough for a perfect beach or pool vacay read! A different twist than expected!
030758836X|2.0|This book was too long, same could have been said with less words/pages. It sounded a bit like the Scott Peterson case for a few chapters but then got twisted and stupid, ambiguous ending, I suggesting skipping this book. If you want suspenseful, engaging and interesting - check out Chevy Stevens books.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|picsart is the greatest app ever I love it please get it and rate it by the way its just like instgram k love it plz get it itss the best app ever
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|Real BoxingTM is the best 3d boxing game so far on an android device. It has an amazing 3d Graphics, 3d Characters but the background is only a picture but that's alright. And it has an Amazing ultra-realistic motion capture from real boxers. Also it has an amazing background commentators. The controls, well we all know most of the games on an android device is a bit pain in the butt but practice will get you on the right tracks. Also one of favorite thing about this game is the gore on every hard punch you do you could really see the blood rushing down from your opponents face and the blood splash to. And the sound is fantastic to. The gameplay is awesome I haven't noticed any bugs since I got the game. And I like the fact that you could choose your own nationality. There's only one problem for me which is the money you get after a win which is not much so it'll take you some time to beat all the levels or buy some coins for more cash. But here's what I did I also bought an add-on to the game for 1.99 which is 2x more coins so you'll get more coins on every match on career mode you finish.<br /><br />Here's my Ratings<br /><br />Graphics - 5/5<br />Commentators - 5/5<br />Controls - 3/5 but when your use to it 5/5<br />Gore - 5/5<br />Tutorial - 5/5<br />Navigation - 5/5<br />Gameplay - 5/5<br />Sound effect - 5/5<br /><br />Here's what I'd like to see in the future<br /><br />Online Multiplayer<br />More stylish clothing for your boxer<br />More harder opponents<br />More coins to earn on every wins you get<br />3d background people<br />And more yelling and cheering<br /><br />Over All this game is FANTASTIC and highly addictive. I've been playing this game for 2 hours of non-stop playing I highly suggest this game for everyone. You won't regret buying this game and plus it's the best boxing game on the app store.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Very nice Alarm App!!  Big bright display that is easy to read at night.  Alarm has all the features needed for use at home and on the road.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Have not played this yet, as I did not have sufficient memory to install and run it on my old handset and have not attempted to download it to my new handset.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|Pretty silly. Some funny moments.  I like animated films. This is no &#34;incredibles&#34; or ants or even Kung fu panda
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Was unable to install this on my old handset and have yet to try it on my new one, as Space and the Star Wars versions are much better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and totally free definitely recommend this game for kids,some teenagers,and even adults I got it started playing it and got addicted to it
B005PK553C|5.0|I enjoyed this series it was very suspenseful and good story line kept me ion the edge of me seat
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Great idea for a story line, but it seemed to me like it really dragged everything out. Then ended oddly. I really wanted to like it. I was definitely disappointed.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I enjoyed this third in the Robert Downey, Jr. Iron Man series. This edition added more dimensions to Tony's character. I enjoyed the repartee between Ty Simpkins, as Harley Keener, and Robert Downey as Tony. Nice seeing Tony interacting with a child who can hold his own.<br /><br />I also enjoyed Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin. With the twists and turns, action, and story development I recommend this movie.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Based on reviews that I had read about this movie, I waited for the DVD rather than seeing it in a theater.  I do not understand the negative reviews (many said that it was worse than the second Iron Man) as I think the second one left a lot to be desired whereas this one could have (should have?) been the sequel to first Iron Man.
0375836675|3.0|I Am the Messenger is a unique character driven partly-mystery, mostly-coming of age, partly-realistic novel. Ed Kennedy, the protagonist, is not an easy character to like. He is mopey, lazy and boring. Which makes him an unlikely recruit for a covert mission conducted by a mystery character who doesn't reveal himself to Ed or the other people running errands for him. Ed is given obscure clues directing him to townspeople who need a life intervention of some kind. Ed must figure out who the person is and what kind of help is needed, then provide that help. Some of the people need small tokens of appreciation and some are in need of rescue from dangerous situations. Why Ed chooses to become involved is not clear and never really becomes clear. He is not promised anything in return for his help. He is just told he needs to do it. Is it because Ed recognizes his life is going nowhere, and he is finally ready for something more? Is it because he can relate to the feelings of desperation of the people he helps? The townspeople Ed helps change him and empower him to change himself. They teach him how to be a better person and a better friend. I Am the Messenger may be too slow and too philosophical for reluctant readers. Ed is like a less frantic, but equally unhappy, Holden Caulfield. Ed, however, is wise enough to observe what is good in others, appreciate those qualities and to learn from those people. Ed is a much more interesting person at the end thanks to the mystery character who sends him on his quest.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I had to get this book the quickest way possible and that was by ebook.  It is book 2 of the Shining but I don't think you need to have read The Shining to enjoy it.  I always wondered what happened to Danny and his mom Wendy.  This skips over the rest of his childhood until adulthood. I did not like Dan, as he is called when is older, very much.  Same pitfals as his parents but the struggle to overcome was worth it.<br />Loved it!
014241493X|2.0|The Fault in Our Stars was my first John green novel. I loved it. So, I was eager to read Paper Towns and heartbroken by how disappointed I was. Paper Towns is very entertaining in the first 75 or so pages when shy, mopey, responsible, likeable Quentin is convinced by eccentric, cool, popular Margo to go out in the middle of the night for several hours of clever, funny, acts of vengeance. The idea of Margo coercing Q is the first problem. Although Margo and Q were best friends as children, Margo has totally ignored his existence for many years. After all those of years of Margo treating him like he does not exist, Quentin just cows down and gives her what she wants without question when she suddenly shows up at his house? Ick. Very pathetic. The second problem is that Q has been pining over Margo for all of those years when he was invisible to her. The hapless male teen protagonist being duped by the girl he worships from afar is just too predictable. The third problem is the next 150 pages. Margo disappears after their night together, and Q is obsessed with finding her. Since she is 18 and has a history of running away, the police refuse to get involved. Margo's parents are relieved not to have to deal with her drama and chaos any longer. Q is convinced the obscure clues Margo left for him to find are ominous. He stops living his normal life, stops being his normal self and focuses only on finding out what happened to Margo. By the time the story reached its climax, I did not care where Margo was or what happened to her. I could understand why her parents wrote her off. Like Q's two wonderful, loyal friends (also way too predictable), I just wanted him to move on. But of course, the hapless male teen must stay true to his love and his quest to save her.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Uniquely told story of the zombie apocalypse. Thankfully I watched the movie before reading this book. Had it been the other way around, the mediocre movie would have pissed me the hell off.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|My husband is addicted to this show- it's like X Files with a scientific twist.  It really pushes the envelope on ideas and I love Walter
B0094BB4TW|1.0|My opinion is that YOU SHOULD NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! NEWS FEED IS HORRIBLE!! DO NOT GET THIS APP! It's so stupid and sucks.
B004P8JPS6|1.0|Very wordy,just to fill space. And the obligatory love interest resulting in sex whenever possible. Was able to skip many chapters and still keep up.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I cannot wait for season 4, just finished season 3, and am finding myself upset at how season 3 ended. I felt like I was actually part of the story, and actually cried! I can't help but think as the years go by, that modernization won't take away from the story. I love the interaction between Maggie Smith and Shirley McLaine. Some of the dialogue had me laughing out loud! I do hope that the main characters stay alive!
B0041KBWM0|5.0|The BBC series are so wonderful...settings...costumes...acting...all outstanding...brings classic stories to life and really relates them to today...we are lucky to have access to them
B00E9ZATVW|4.0|I am a huge fan of all things Pixar - their stories are universal and the animation is beautiful. I have mixed feelings about \\"Cars\\" though, I find it to be one of Pixar's weakest films. Still, it's more fun than most other animated movies out there, so it's worth a watch if you've never seen it. Obviously, the movie was well-liked because its success has spawned both a sequel (\\"Cars 2\\") and a spinoff (\\"Mater's Tall Tales\\"), as well as multiple short films.<br /><br />There's no doubt the \\"Cars\\" movies are very popular with kids. After all, what little boy hasn't spent hours playing with toy race cars? I know I spent a lot of time playing with cars, and this movie channels that excitement that I felt playing as a kid. A lot of kids also find Mater (a comic relief character voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) to be appealing - in fact, I'd say that Mater has become one of the most well-known characters in any Pixar movie (except maybe Woody & Buzz).<br /><br />\\"Cars\\" will soon be re-released in a 3D Ultimate Collector's Edition. The big question is: should you buy this 3D version or stick with the 2D version? Well, the first thing to know is that \\"Cars\\" was not originally intended to be 3D, so this will be a post-conversion job. But after watching the film, it is clear that there are plenty of opportunities for great 3D moments (and just about every scene will benefit from the added depth). Pixar has an excellent track record when it comes 3D quality, and \\"Cars 2\\" looked great in 3D. So there's no reason to think that \\"Cars 3D\\" will be anything less than spectacular.<br /><br />CARS 3D Blu-Ray - 3-Disc Set<br />DISC 1: 3D Blu-Ray Movie<br />DISC 2: Blu-Ray Movie + Special Features<br />DISC 3: DVD<br />*Digital Copy redemption code is also included (no disc required)
B00992CF6W|4.0|this app is great but in creative you cant fight monters open chests or use supplies like that and you  dont get night time in creative.<br />but besides that its really fun!
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Great writing, simple story with life long lessons, never say die, movie making at its best, terrific acting and scenery
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The app is easy to use and it has lots of options for the alarm. I am very happy with it.
B0049MPHXK|3.0|I'm a big fan of Neil gaiman and have read most of his other books and loved them. But I haven't finished this one as I have to admit I was a bit bored. The usual magic is a bit lacking unfortunately. I'm sure I'll return to finish it but I think I would reread the graveyard book instead or perhaps anansi boys.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|Jack The Giant Slayer has set a record that no one should be proud of. This film made the least amount of money, compared to the amount of money spent on it, in box office history! The film gives new meaning to the word bomb, as it cost the studio approximately 80 million dollars! The goal of this film was ambitious, but the problem was that it completely misses all of it's target audiences. The writers wanted to take the story of Jack & The Beanstalk and adapt it for more mature audiences. Parts of it almost seemed like they were looking to make it an epic adventure, like the Lord of The Rings, but the Lord of The Rings it is not. The problem with this film is that while they built up the intensity, they didn't go far enough to make adults want to see it. On the flip side, with all the added death and violence, it garnered a PG-13 rating, which meant that younger kids weren't going to see it either. Personally, I liked what they did with the story and I think Nicholas Hoult is a terrific actor, but the way they wrote this film was just a disaster waiting to happen. When they build up the suspense and something is about to happen, they don't show it, because it would be too intense for the kids. When they go the comedic route, the fart jokes, bees in the helmet, and gigantic bad breath is a turn off to the adults. At times I felt like I was watching a kids movie, while at other times I felt as though I was watching one of these three an a half hour epic trilogies. The film couldn't decide how it wanted to go and as a result, it didn't appeal to very many. You can't argue the fact that the film bombed at the box office and I think you can't argue the fact that it did so for a good reason.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Yet another success from Rovio. I have all the Angry Birds games so when I saw Angry Birds Star Wars II was out, I had to have it. Plus this was free!
B005COO1X6|1.0|A book well written but geared more towards the younger reader. Not plausible in real life, the plot makes it really stupid.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I came across Lindseys music on Pandora and really enjoyed it so I had to find out if she had albums. I saw one album on Amazon and had to have it. Makes me want more!
B007RRFUHM|5.0|I've been following Kimbra for almost 3 years now. Love her to death and this album is just the beginning.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|It becomes more challenging as you play! Great for passing time super cute creatures and the graphics are pretty neat
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|This was an awesome movie & the quality of the video is exceptional. Definitely recommending it to friends & family.
0061367036|5.0|It was awesome, way better than I even imagined, I love it, if your a supernatural fan then you need this book!!
B003VANOFY|4.0|This product is great, the wireless function is a real improvement over the old wired headset (G35). The only downside is that the battery life is short (10 hours I know...) for real gamers.<br /><br />This headset isn't a piece of equipment for the regular PC user though, it's expensive and brings his use in 3D-audio supported games and movies. Although a real surroundsound still has the upperhand for Movies.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I got this game so my kids and I could play it. While it does have some of the more predictable social gaming aspects, it also. Is quite enjoyable. The addition of making animal families is pleasantly unique.
1401937519|5.0|A good friend of mine, who experienced the death of a child, is a nuclear physicist. He can think abstractedly with the best of them, and armed with the keen insight of a highly trained scientist, he can postulate possibilities where spirituality blends seamlessly with the laws of the universe. His thought processes run along the lines of one of thermodynamic's unshakable rules....energy cannot be destroyed, it only changes shape. In this case, the energy that we call our soul, moves on to another dimension. Call it heaven, or whatever, but I personally have seen this process transpire before my very eyes on two occasions when loved ones died in my presence. Their newly freed souls sought me out with purposeful intensity. I am a religious historian, and claim adherence to no organized religion, but what I observed, parallels Ms. Moorjani's description of her own experience. I believe her 100%. Religion has very little to do with this natural process, but our personal concepts of God certainly do, and our joint experiences prove, to me, that love is a part of it all.<br /><br />[...]
B004AQR29C|2.0|Found ourselves spending more time saying 'what did Stallone (or Rourke) say'  and 'why did they need to go that far?' than anything else. Should have known when it was $4.99 in the local supermarket checkout line...<br /><br />What a great cast and and an equally great missed opportunity. This had the chance to not take itself quite so seriously and add a little parody from each actor's high profile past, but its aim was off target.<br /><br />Got this because we wanted to see Expendables 2 and thought we should watch Expendables 1 first... now not so sure we should bother with 2.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|We'd missed most of the current series so this purchase helped us catch up.  The crisp writing and character development we enjoy is still there. We weren't able to make it through the episode where a camera crew was supposedly visiting the precinct. The first-person camera view got tiresome /really/ early and the plot was unbelievable. This was the only Jumped-The-Shark episode I'd seen since the 1940's flashback costume drama one from a few seasons back. As long as they don't mess with success, this is still an entertaining series.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Very fun game. Just about easy. It's also very addictive, I can play all day! At home, at work, on the toilet, where ever!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Excellent show...kind of a Soprano-vibe but with an outlaw motorcycle gang instead of Tony and his crew. Very dark and violent but with deeply etched and honed out characters. I am a 60 yr old female, probably not your target audience for the show, but I love it. I highly recommend giving it a try....if you are a Prime member, first four seasons are free on Amazon. I think I watched 10 in a row one day!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|The end of the series was most welcome.  In this book the battle sequences were somewhat long and tedious, but the end was good to read.  It also left an opening for a sequel.  The Kindle version was delivered promptly and surely.  Thank you.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Makes me smile, characters are likable, story line not too crazy off the wall stupid.  Always want to immediately watch the next show which makes it hard to stop
0765316994|5.0|I had just gotten the card game when a friend showed me this book....went for it and enjoyed it very much.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I love playing solitaire but when I shuffle and deal the cards I don't get these combinations.  Just about every hand has two pairs of cards that are the same number and same color.  What are the odds?  It gets old real fast.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Addicting to put it mildly.  Even 4yr. Old enjoys.  Only reason I stopped is I have to get her ready for bed.  One prob once I reached chap 16 sure I can get past it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun and challenging! Easy to play on a cell phone and quick to move through the levels! Really good fun!
B001NYPTO4|5.0|I loved the movie, and once had the CD, but it has been misplaced.  I'm glad I was able to merely download this and not have to wait for delivery.
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|I really enjoyed it and not so bad that the older kids cant watch it. will probably even watch it again which as many movies that I watch means a lot.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|I love Euro music....and this is one of my favorite groups.  It's a fusion of jazz, blues, vocals...just awesome.  Listen to some of the samples and listen for yourself.  Many co-workers of mine come into my space and will hear them and be like &#34;wow that's nice...who is that?&#34;  And I mention that there is more than country and tejano to listen to LOL
031623480X|5.0|Board-certified neurologist Dr. David Perlmutter provides plenty of food for thought in \\"Grain Brain,\\" in which he claims to reveal \\"the surprising truth about wheat, carbs, and sugar--your brain's silent killers.\\"  It is no secret that diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and dementia are taking a huge toll on our aging population.  As far as brain health is concerned, the author insists that \\"the fate of your brain is not in your genes,\\" but rather \\"in the food you eat.\\"  He goes on to say that \\"modern grains are destroying your brain.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter points his finger not just at white flour, pasta, and rice, but also at whole grain products including stone-ground and multigrain bread and oatmeal.  In addition, some fruits and seemingly benign carbohydrates can \\"accelerate your body's aging process\\" and \\"wreak physical havoc on your brain.\\"  It would be tempting to dismiss Dr. Perlmutter's ideas as wild and implausible if he did not include so many controlled scientific studies that back up many of his assertions.<br /><br />\\"Grain Brain\\" is a well-written, organized, meticulously researched, and provocative work that poses many important questions: How does our twenty-first century diet of processed foods differ from that of our grandparents and great-grandparents? What role does inflammation play in disease?  Is high cholesterol a killer and should we take statin drugs to lower it?  What is gluten?  If we adopt a gluten-free, low carbohydrate diet, which diseases might we avoid? Which ingredients turn on the body's antioxidants? Does a high-fat diet promote obesity?<br /><br />The media constantly bombards us with contradictory information about which health habits to adopt. Hundreds of diet books are published annually, touting this or that food plan.  No one has the final word; there is no magic pill; and although Dr. Perlmutter is convincing, other equally qualified practitioners will surely disagree with some of his conclusions.  Still, knowledge is power and whether or not you empty your bread box, toss your cereals, and decide to change your lifestyle to conform to Dr. Perlmutter's recommendations, \\"Grain Brain\\" has undeniable value.  It teaches us a great deal about genetics, the mechanisms that keep the human body running smoothly, the etiology of disease, and the ways in which particular foods, as well as sensible exercise and good sleep habits, can boost brain power and promote better health and longevity.power and whether or not you empty your bread box, toss your cereals, and decide to change your lifestyle to conform to Dr. Perlmutter's recommendations, \\"Grain Brain\\" has undeniable value.

B00F35BV64|5.0|This is simply a good story set to amazing special effects. I'm starting to get past the paradox of the new characters playing the old, and, instead, enjoying these new stories that deviate from the old.
B000I0XLYO|1.0|I watched most of this movie on an airplane, drawn in by the excellent cast and promising premise.  After a while, it is just bad, then embarrassing.  I paused when some food came (just after a dreadful scene in which David Bowie judged a show) and didn't bother to return.<br /><br />Judging from the other reviews, I can imagine stupid people might like this movie.
B000PC0SPU|5.0|I Liked to read a new approach to everyday work. I loved all the practical advise to improve my skills in the 6areas.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I originally didn't want to see this because the story in my head from reading the books was always better than what someone could put on a screen.  While I still believe that, they really did a fantastic job and it was incredibly entertaining.  I highly recommend it!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Very easy to use - I like it better than J-Tube...not too many ads to see either.  Also offers download option
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Great characters and magic system, and well-paced and structured. I recommend digging right in to this story about Shai, a young woman who is a forger and thief, but also an artist and a dreamer. Caught and captured, she must do her greatest work ever in far too short a time, to save an empire and, if possible, save herself.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|the tinkerbell series is one of the best disney series ever in my opinion. there are never bad guys in their movies, just good people resolving conflicts with each other. that is so refreshing of a change from the typical good guy/evil guy plots of old.<br /><br />i've owned and watched all 4 movies with my kids and this was one of the most touching. a wonderful story of friendship and adventure and overcome challenges together. I hope disney never stops this series. it is rare to see a sequel outdo the priors but tinkerbell continues to amaze me.<br /><br />buy it! you won't regret it.<br /><br />Note i bought the deluxe set with downloadable movie to ipad. it works pretty well and easily loads up on itunes. my kids now borrow my ipad regularly and probably use it more than me. a wonderful educational tool by the way if used correctly and monitored carefully. loaded movies are key for road trips and long plane trips.<br /><br />Also note, the deluxe set (3D blu-ray/DVD) also comes with pixie hollow games on the DVD as bonus. that is an excellent short movie that my kids like watching as much as secret of the wings.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Great upbeat song, puts you in a good mood!  Pharrell does great music, has worked with all the greats,new artist .
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Epic. Exhilarating. Larger than life. The winter is coming. Great characters for the ages. Ned Stark, Tywin and his dwarf son - Tyrion - a true giant.<br />Can't wait to get to the next book.
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|I won't go into too much detail because odds are if anyone isn't sure, I can't imagine one more great review would tip the scale. The songs are all strong, the production is the best they have ever had, and Mike Mangini is incredible. I don't miss Portnoy and his trademark fills and awful backing vocals either. I loved the last album but this is their best since Octavarium or Images. Just my opinion. The album mixes all the styles that the band does well. Highly recommended from a fan since 1992.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I am not typically a sci fi fan. This was well written and plausible. Every bit of it entertaining.<br />Each chapter drew me to the next.
0525953728|5.0|This book was purchased as a gift for my husband. My daughter got her hands on it first(jr. high student) it went through her, her girlfriend, my other teen daughter then finally to my husband.<br />They ALL loved it:)
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|I've watched all the tinkerbells including the latest secret of the wings (fantastic story by the way).<br /><br />This is a really touching story of tinkerbell befriending a little girl who lives with her single dad who seems always too busy with work to have time for her. they form an unexpected friendship and help each other in this story of friendship, family, and believing.<br /><br />the songs are amazing as well as expected from tinkerbell. I would not hesitate to buy this one. you won't regret it!

Secondly, the songs are stripped down and a little bit country-tinged, the melodies are strong, and Taupin's lyrics are more direct than usual (mostly).  I've bought two or three of his last LPs out of a sense of duty and then stopped listening.  This one I'm playing all the time.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|I was excited to read this book after all the hype the show was getting. I was a bit disappointed in the book. I have to say it was a bit boring and slow moving. Now that I am watching the show I see that they take the plot lines from the book but beef them up because the real story doesn't have enough substance to make it interesting.
B00AZM7IQC|4.0|yeah me and the kids stopped watching after a while. it is a bit repetitive. nice to see the different las vegas shows and brings back good memories of when I saw O there.<br /><br />overall though decent buy. i love cirque du soleil. the permanent shows (particularly O and La Nouba) are the best as they have a more sophisticated stage compared to the traveling shows which pretty much are all the same after a while with different music.
B002VPE1WK|1.0|After one month of use, the straps are coming loose. The zippers feel cheap and do not let the second pocket open enough to be useful. There is no solid structure to the bottom or sides of the camera compartment. The lack of tripod straps on the bottom or the left side cuts down on the storage. Bag feels undersized. For only a bit more, you can get this bag [[ASIN:B00009R6TA Canon Deluxe Backpack 200EG Cameras]] that is basically superior in every way.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Excellent, classical book on the influence of 'bugs' on the history of the world. This is really worth the read
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|This is a great show with top-quality actors and a tight, nicely complex, and suspenseful plot - nothing less than what you'd expect from the BBC.  Now that the season is over (here in America), you won't have to wait for the next episode!  Definately for fans of other BBC triumphs like Whitechappel.
B00DK9FNLY|1.0|I don't review much but I must say this app, to be quite frank, is extremely dull and boring. The first thing I noticed was it had the look and feel of a free game. Not free app of the day, just normally free. No music, and from what I could stand playing of it about three, MAYBE four sounds to the game (two of which being ball-paddle contact and ball-table contact). I can't confirm whether there truly is any adware as indicated in another review but I can say that after two minutes I uninstalled. I could never get the spin or power that I wanted on the ball, to be honest purchasing the old-school game Pong would honestly be more fun.<br /><br />Get it as the free app of the day if you like, but temper expectations greatly.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We're so spoiled watching one episode after another.  It will be hard to switch to &#34;normal&#34; TV viewing.  We may just have to wait until after the season is &#34;over&#34; and it's on Amazon.com!
B00F8L2VO4|1.0|I read some of the other reviews and it seemed to be a good app, but after trying it myself I can't believe anyone would think this is great or even good. I wanted to learn some Spanish, but I guess you are supposed to already know some Spanish to do this. It starts out showing you some pictures and your supposed to pick  the Spanish words for the picture. If you don't know you just pick, there is no English-Spanish before hand. Then as you move along they ask you to type out in English Spanish sentences using words you haven't even seen yet!  If you need to stop before the end of the lesson you lose everything and have to start all over. I deleted this real quick. Don't bother with this.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is the best Stephen King book in years.  The Shining is one of my favs and I really looking forward to this read.  I was not disappointed.  This is Danny's story and he grew up fine.  The story was wonderful and I had the rare experience of wanting to savor every page.  Thank you Mr. King.  I really enjoyed my visit with an old friend.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was very well written. The style is very different from the popular books published recently; and it was much more thought provoking than most of the popular books written today.
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|I've seen this one several times now.  This is so appealing to so many, to parents, to kids, to boys, to chess players.  And it's appealing on so many levels.  A great, all-star cast, with superb acting.  I love it and feel its a 'new' classic!  Of course, I love movies based on true stories too.  A definite winner!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Cleverly cast written and played. Gratuitous language is the spoiler for me.<br />Lov interest for the head cheese might be good next.
B00634GHJA|2.0|More involved that it appeared.  Hardly use it and it moves only one picture at a time with great deal of preparation.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a kindle e-reader copy of the trilogy and works very well on my Kindle.  I have had a good experience will all my e-books so far.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is awesome because I always loved the Jurassic Park books and movies and I always thought that if I could run Jurassic Park I would run it totally different than what the people did so I loved it.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I bought the book today and I cant put it down!!! Im already on chapter 6..... I dont think I can stop until Im done reading it. Its a must have. I dont normally read things like this but Its going towards Bob and his Human. Cant get any better than this!!
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|E Squared Nine didn't deliver on its promise, and was extremely too wordy.  This could have been a ten page pamphlet and I would have LOVED it./
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers its an easy fun and entertaining game I play it at least 5 times a day if not more .
1591845556|1.0|It would have  helpful if you wanted to learn the few things suggested on their subject matter.<br />Big disappointment , waste of money
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|You have to look past a few cheesy special effects, but the story line is great. Bad Wolf is clever
B00B7G3Y4U|5.0|This is by far the best movie from Paranormal Activity.  It is scary and keeps you on your toes.  We loved it and would recommend this movie to anyone that is into reality horror movies.
B003VIWO9I|2.0|I find that this book meanders and wanders too much to be a \\"last of the series.\\" there is so much small stuff that needs explaining. When I finished reading it all I said was \\"hmmm.\\" I feel that the author's wit and humor fizzled on this one. Everything seemed darker even the Nac Mac Feagels. Even they were portrayed as too serious. Personally I think a fifth book may need doing just to fix/explain this one.
1781162646|3.0|I do not feel like this was one of King's better books.  I like more content in a story was kind of slow and had little action.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved every chapter! I couldn't put it down until the end and still wanted more. I highly recommend this book!
B00E8S2JZ4|4.0|I liked it. It was a very interesting movie and generally, well done movie. Can't wait to see the second part of the movie.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|It was good I have slit of fun playing this online  every one should get this game of that have a tablet
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love The Walking Dead and this season was great.  This is something coming from me because I am not into zombie shows but this is something I do not mind paying full price to watch.  Warning*!*!* Very Addicting. LOL!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I love movies aimed at us baby boomers.  Plus my favorite actors all in the same movie!  Great rainy day movie.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|hard to get him to repeat what i say...sometimes yes, sometimes no. i didn't like the way i was not warned that i would be taken to a page to buy ($) more test tubes.  so if if like that option, i would be paying, and paying and paying. not cool.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|...Where to start?<br />Invoking different emotions on so many levels. John Green has become one of my top authors: the novel is  about Hazel and Augustus becoming friends, deeper  than that is the cancer that they both have. Living their life in a World where no one could understand giving a percentage on  to your life...it's much deeper than that, to sum it up I am speechless and a loss for the written word, if I could give  this  novel  a 10 I would.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|I love this movie and have bought the uncut version also with extra scenes. It is great and explains a little more.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for the story to continue. Yet another cliff hanger to mull over while we wait not so patiently for another fix.
B000FC146C|5.0|I saw the film many years ago but for some reason never read the book. A great mistake!  Really enjoyed it. Though if you do not know Australia do not think it is all like the places in this book. Yes they do exist but could not be more different from  where I live in Tasmania or from where Colleen McCullough lives on Norfolk Island.  If you want to know what they are like read her great book 'Morgans Run'.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|the older version was great.  it was very simple, easy to use, very useful.  the new version has nothing but superfluous features and often fails to deliver the weather information you need!  I finally lost my patience and uninstalled this app.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Once again ND knocks it out of the park. The intriguing story line adds to the enjoyment.  The screens are clear and crisp and the variety of challenges keeps our interest. My 6 year old granddaughter insisted on helping and cheered when we rescued .... so addicting!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I have many apps to learn a foriegn language, this one by far is the best at getting you ready to actually read.
B00F35BV64|3.0|I love all the Star Trek movies new and old. This one I did not like. It felt worn out. It was forced. Was not up to the standards of the other Star Trek movies. Lucky to get 3 stars. I don't want to bring Star Trek ratings down.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|Great movie, story keeps you engaged the entire film. A must watch for anyone who enjoys a well written story.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I don't know how other kids are, but when mine really love a movie they want to watch it over... and over... and over. This is one of those movies!<br /><br />The movie includes positive messages about being kind, and the value of good friends (in line with the tv series). It also has a few catchy musical numbers that my girls love to sing around the house.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love it!! I love this show!!<br />The only thing I would like is for the closed captioning to be bigger. I selected the largest option but the subtitles were still very hard to read.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The storyline of each episode is interesting and holds my attention. The characters are RIVETING! Once you are hooked, watching Kalinda is a major treat. She is an intense and driven character and you must know more about her. Watching the show is very addictive because you want to put the pieces of the current story line together, but you also want the writers to reveal a little nugget about the characters.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Although a little drawn out, the end of this book was really good. As I was waiting and waiting through the endless characters' lives of this book to get to the climax, the end was not as predictable as I imagined.  I think each one of the characters could of had their own book though, making it a lot easier to not get their drama confused from chapter to chapter.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I watched this because of my son. I liked it. I found myself wanting more. It was a way better than I thought it would be.
B005DJREJS|1.0|I thought this sounded like a nice comedy show about the awkward teenage years.  I don't think I was watching it for three minutes before there were numerous sexual references and a scene with the main character losing her viginity in a custodial closet.  I turned it off during that scene. This is NOT the kind of entertainment that I am looking for...this could have been done much better and still been funny.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great app that makes retrieving mail conveniently.  A must have for quickly locating and checking mail.  I would definitely recommend this.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|Written years ago, but so relevant in today's events. NSA, mystery, double cross, love, secrets. No Robert Langdon here, but you can see a character who must have sparked Brown's idea of Langdon. You will not be disappointed. A must-read for all Dan Brown fans.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Well written, very interesting, and it keeps your attention all the way through the book.  I would read more of this author!
B004YXE438|4.0|This is a fun game if you like jigsaw type puzzles. I love that I can use my own photos. Works great on the Kindle Fire.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Thanks very much, Dave!  We very much appreciate your music - especially all of us 60 year old retired Northwest Airlines aircraft inspectors, who have listened to your band since the dinosaurs walked the earth - ha-ha!<br /><br />&#34;Forget to Remember&#34; - worth the price of the entire cd.  Keep em' coming, Dave.<br /><br />Please keep Chris around - he compliments you very well.  Rock on.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon Prime & UPS brown - they do cd music delivery most perfect.
B0060D2WYI|5.0|I missed this movie when it came out.  We bought, we saw, we liked it.  Good to find movies that everyone can watch.  No smut, no bad language.  It's not stellar, but it's good.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game gladly it takes my mind off everything else. Thanks so much<br /><br />I am excited to find more games l can enjoy as much as this one
B005544V6A|5.0|Have been binge watching this show.  Great way to catch up to the current season -- no commercials -- no waiting for next week's episode.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The best sounds ever. I've downloaded quite a few, but this is the best! it has sounds I never thought to ask for. If you can't find your sound here, I doubt you'll find it! Excellent!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it CONSTANTLY!! Lists, notes, recipes, pictures, Pintrest links, etc. It keeps me organized but most importantly, it keeps me SANE.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Excitement from beginning to end! Was afraid to go to the fridge in case I would miss something, I mean who really pauses good movies no?
B003JHKORK|5.0|Excellent series of movies.  This one did not disappoint.  Special effects are fun.  Acting is good.  Story is captivating.  We really enjoyed this movie.  We're looking forward to the next one.
B00EL8I8IS|3.0|3/5... its ok.... obviously the sequel will be better.<br /><br />I wish they had provided us with more, atleast the origin. Maybe a interestingly unique origin. But no.. we just get a life story of someone.... and everyone else just dies..
B0063IH60K|4.0|Pop up ads are annoying with free version but like not having to drag  and drop cards. You just tap on them and they go to the correct position.
B005MLP5E8|3.0|Second 2 adds three different faces for SLEEZY politics: Glenn Childs, Attorney Canning, and Wendy Scott-Carr along with Cary's predictable politicking in the wake of the intentional competition (and obvious lack of leadership) at the Lockhart-Gardner-Stern firm.<br /><br />Gangster mystique, bully mentality, and general thuggery linger in Chicago, Las Vegas, and New Jersey in the 21st century.<br /><br />All too ordinary ...
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is my new favorite book....great writing, great characters and wonderful story.  I have recommended this book highly allaropund my circles.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Visually striking movie, and a phenomenal cast! I think DiCaprio embodied Gatsby perfectly. .. dare I say, better than Redford??<br />I was not a fan of his early work,  specifically Titanic, but he's made great choices since then and this was certainly one of them!  I have loved story since high school and was happy to see the visions I had in my head come to life.  Probably not for everyone, but what movie is? ? If you are familiar with the book, and enjoyed it,  watch this!
B00D7NWTSI|1.0|Even 3D could not save this Iron Man 3 movie.<br /><br />The 3D itself was mediocre by today's standards.  They short-changed the great acting skills and experience of the Colonel (Don Cheadle). They pathetically overplayed Tony Stark's ability to fight out of the Iron Man suit as if he was a secret agent. The completely unnecessary emergence of Disney-based homosexual scenes (the technical guy's tattoo and love affair with Tony Stark in the trailer).  And Tony Stark's character was a bleeping Chatter Box who talked entirely too much.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 died from suffocation from two HUGE Double-Ds as a result of Disney's (their owner) emerging and KISS-OF-DEATH influence on Marvel. As typical of Disney's productions, those Huge Double-D's did not come from a woman, but a man:  Disney gave Robert Downey Jr. too much input in DIALOGUE and DIRECTING.<br /><br />Marvel's ultimate Kiss-of-Death will be Disney.<br /><br />Stay Safe,<br /><br />...GhillieMan

140006922X|5.0|Aslan's book provides a clear and engaging analysis of how Christianity evolved from a small sect of independence-seeking Jews to the officially sanctioned religion of the Roman empire.<br /><br />Aslan argues that the origins of Christianity, including the internal contradictions in the New Testament, can be interpreted in the context of the political, religious and social turmoil of first century Israel.  Aslan makes a strong case that earlier texts, especially the Q source documents, support the contention that Jesus was a messianic revolutionary in the model of other first century Jewish political activists who fought and died for the emancipation of Israel from Roman rule.  He argues that \\"King of the Jews\\" implied, by definition, a rejection of Roman authority, and that crucifixion was a punishment reserved for sedition.  He draws analogies to the lives and fate of less well know revolutionaries, including Judas the Galilean, who also fought for Jewish independence and suffered a similar fate at the hands of the Roman authorities.  Aslan contends that many of the revisions to the origin myth -- e.g. setting the location of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem, not Nazareth -- were included by early Jewish supporters to support the notion that Jesus was the \\"messiah\\" -- that is, the heir to King David and the person \\"anointed\\" to restore the independence and grandeur of the Jewish nation.<br /><br />He further contends that the destruction of Jerusalem by Roman forces in 70 CE was the defining moment in the shift of Christianity away from its Jewish origins.  First, in order to avoid persecution, the authors of the Gospels -- written in the decades following the massacre -- deemphasized the political and revolutionary nature of Jesus in favor of a more pacifist, spiritual figure.  Second, the death of Jerusalem-based supporters, including Jesus' brother James in 62 CE, shifted power to the sect of Paul, who had always emphasized the concept of Jesus as an ethereal extension of God.  Third, surviving adherents to Christianity were more likely to be Hellenized -- noting that the Gospels and related texts were all written in Greek -- and hence less closely tied to Jewish tradition and more willing to embrace a religious figure less focused on the liberation of Israel than the salvation of mankind.  Fourth, the Hellenized Jews were more willing to indoctrinate gentiles, which further severed ties to Judaism.  Fifth, Hellenized supporters were more likely to embrace the concept a demigod-like figure, which was anathema in Jewish tradition, and the less rigid notion of salvation through faith rather than the elaborate Laws of Moses.
B0066NA8CU|3.0|The series that I saw offered insight into the personal side of the encrouchment of media, politics, and technology into the lives of citizens in contemporary society: not just in the United States. Likewise, the impact of the lingering recession on life, even in the upper middle and upper income brackets.<br /><br />For instance, political campaigning through Twitter and Internet video smears, crippling the State's Attorney office by setting up a sex scandal, illegal wire tapping secured through unfounded allegations.<br /><br />\\"In my opinion,\\" the Alicia character is not victim or a martyr: she is an adult person who has made important choices in her life, most of them admirably. Alicia ADAPTS to life as it happens; yet Kalinda (who is not a rival for affections of Alicia's husband, nor a competitor in her work environment, rather she is an ally), encourages Alicia to be more assertive taking responsibility for what happens in her career.<br /><br />Florrick comes from a family that seems t have been affluent, by his mother's means, therefore, why would they not own their house after fifteen years of marriage?

B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was funny and quirky, Had it read in less than a day! perfect book to go to the doctor's office to read while waiting, definitely won't notice the time flying by.
B00DMXJ2KG|5.0|Just when I thought you couldn't possibly release an album after years of touring on material that was for the most part at LEAST a decade old..... you go and do something like this... and TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF! Ok so Primus had solidified their place as some of the most incredible musicians on the planet by the early 90's and had no need for redemption, but there was a distinct feeling after their 2003 'Animals' ep and 2006 'best of' tour that they were riding off into the sunset, slowly but surely. But as it seems with some of the most storied bands of all-time in the past decade or so, the universe would once again conspire to breath life back into one of the coolest bands that ever was, is and will be. Don't listen to the negative hype - this album is great. Different than some of the earlier recordings that made Primus into a legend, but definitely continues on the tradition, sound and true vibe that is Primus. In a way it was nice to have a different take on that sound, because it finally felt like Primus was once again evolving and not trying to capture something that had come and gone. The first note of Hennepin Crawler hits you like the an abrupt but pleasant smack to the back of the head while simultaneously whispering in your ear... we're back. HELLO! Buy this album, because IT SUCKS!!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I find this series very well acted and written.  Each of their episodes range from well thought out and performed to<br />&#34;Campy&#34;, whereas although the plot can sometimes be &#34;silly&#34;, they are performed in a very enjoyable fashion.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|Interesting theme about a cop who was wrongly accused & found guilty of murder. He is remunerated for the injustice and restored to his former position. I wonder about his mind? Will he snap and become a perpetrator after all he has been through? I give this series a satisfactory rating since the cases are so bizarre they challenge credulity.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Jumps right into the story line and keeps you guessing right up until the end. Fantastic, thrilling, worth the watch!
B0051E9INK|5.0|Highlander is a classic...the story, Sean Connery, they did it all right. If you like movies based on graphic novels and comics, check it out.
B005UG542S|5.0|Could watch this movie over and over again.  All the Actors/Actresses have matured and it really shows in this last segment of Harry Potter!
B005T87QCI|5.0|If it's too hard for you , you can buy your robots , for example: Nitro. He is so big! It's unstoppable and the game  is unbelievably fun! You can choose two good robots , and put them into tag team! I beat the game!

B005544TRQ|4.0|fresh and fun but also well done. good writing and keeps me interested. Casting is great and i am surprised by the plots.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I just started season three and continue to enjoy the series.  Characters develop, new twists to the story are introduced and I  love how history is intertwined.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|so many awesome points to this movie can I just say cannot wait for the second one to come out.  fast delivery and perfect condition.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game for my younger brother, 10 years old, and he can't get enough of it.  The graphics aren't as good as the one for XBox 360, but the game play is fairly similar.  You can register an account Mojong (?) & you can set it up so you can play with friends in the same realm.  All in all, worth the $7 buy.  Would recommend it for those with kids who enjoy RPGs.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I wonder, as I read, where Martin come up with these ideas?  The story just keeps going & new shocks keeps coming!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very challenging. Lots of fun to play. Hours go by like minutes. Mind workout, but you don't have to go to the gym.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this is my third time watching the series. I watch it here on Amazon because I have a Prime account, and TV nearby. I do handsewing while it is on, my favorite time  of day :) I can't think of a character I don't like - even the bad guy has something you can like about him. I wish there were more episodes to watch!
193700788X|5.0|IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK, THERE ARE DEFINITE SPOILERS. That is a warning!<br /><br />Oh, I grew so attached to Harris's characters, and I have been in love with this series. I looked forward to each next book with anticipation, and I was quite sad to say goodbye (and slightly afraid to read the book for that reason. I really hate goodbyes).<br /> I'd heard there were bad reviews and I didn't pay them much attention. I didn't want to know and I'd prefer to find out for myself.<br /><br />Here's the thing. I never believed Sookie'd end up with anyone other than Sam. The idea dangles over our minds in the books with Bill, Alcide, and Eric was the token \\"bad boy,\\" and women like Sookie don't stay with men like Eric (for long anyway). And if they do, it's always a disaster!  Sookie was still young and sort of naive when she met him.  Everyone experiments or flirts with elements that may not end up being permanent fixtures in their lives. And I'm a huge Eric fan, he's exciting. I mean Harris's Eric, not the tv program. I don't care much for it.  I enjoyed living vicariously through these books. The book Eric has major appeal, I won't deny it, but I understand that what was right for Sookie's character was not a life of danger, deception, and possibly death. Really, she deserved better. And she'd made it very clear she didn't in any way shape or form want to be \\"turned\\".<br />  She wanted a sense of normalcy (from which it seems her initial attraction to vampires stems as she couldn't \\"hear\\" them, thus they made her feel normal for the first time, what a relief). Things evolved thereafter and so forth.<br /><br />There was a lot of action, intense plots, magic, and a ton of excitement in the earlier books. I started to see something simmering beneath the surface though as time went on. And it became more apparent that this type of excitement was not what Sookie wanted. It didn't make her happy.  How much longer could she tolerate the bad things? She was starting to begrudge it, feel older, and it seemed to me she was long over the drama. She was slowly finding herself.<br /><br />Sookie was also at an age or milestone in life where thoughts of having her own family were seeping in, and she was setting the stage for her own future. She did stay inside the house more in the last book. She was more reflective. It seemed she thought about the concept of time more near the end. I think it was the right direction. I mean, Sookie wasn't a lavish or greedy woman! I loved her down to earth nature.  She's a small town girl with strong values. Is that not part of what made her such a quirky and charming character to begin with? She has a lot of strength, both inner and outer. And it took time for her to realize just who she is, and that she does in fact \\"belong here\\". Perfect ending.<br /><br />Was it predictable? Sure a bit but it's the final book and it had to tie up loose ends. It's hard to write the last book of series which people are so enamored because it becomes emotional chaos if they are disappointed. The risk of disappointment is highest being that it's the end! The last...<br /><br />I think the third person perspective was a positive because it was different, and it would only be in the last book, again to tie up loose ends. I know everyone is not going to be satisfied, and people disagree but I think Harris is getting a brutal response from people who supposedly were fans. Can't people respect her decision as the author? I am ashamed to read some of what people have said. She didn't deserve that.<br /> Sookie will always be my favorite, dearest to my heart.<br /><br />These are characters whom she created, and she decided to share them with us.  I for one am so glad she did!
B00005V9IK|5.0|need I say anything more, but I must this movie has so many great things in it, my favorite presidential speech is in this movie, will smith love him
B0018QQQK8|1.0|I absolutely LOVE Nicholas Sparks.  I've read everything he's written & I have never been dissatisfied.  This novel was just terrible.  The characters were really not realistic.  I felt like it never really told the story.. it wasn't as deep as his other novels.  The ending left me with so many questions.  It was just a total let down to me after reading so many great novels from him.  I will never re-read this novel & would not recommend it to anyone.
B00766CLPI|3.0|I purchased the re-mastered Classical Barbara album because earlier versions of this album (vinyl, cassette and CD) have brought many hours of pure joy listening to her superb renditions of these great classical pieces--(and  I had always hoped she would release a second volume of classical music). Since this album is one of the all time greats, I thought it would be worthwhile to purchase a re-mastered version. However, I didn't find the recording quality that much improved from the earlier CD, played on McIntosh equipment. The two new bonus tracks are not as desirable as the other content on the album. I suspect those who still have their old vinyl copies of this album in good conition will have the best listening experience.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I would give this book a 6/5 if possible. I don'tknow what it is but this genre just fits me.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|When I saw that this series had a legal or courtroom basis, I almost turned it off.  Fortunately, curiosity won out, particularly my interest in Alicia and Kalinda--both strong, smart, very attractive and somewhat mysterious women.  This enabled me to focus on them and not on the despicable Peter (character and actor) or the courtroom action. In short, I like it in spite of my instincts to turn it off.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|for what ever reason this game starts to crash alot after a couple days even when i re download it....it still doesnt work! it just says not responding force close whateves save ur memory DONT GET THIS GAME
B005COO1X6|3.0|Good scary , a page turner. One of the Kings better novellettes. Hope they never stop publishing these.<br />One of your Constant Readers
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Use this app ALL the time.  It's great for on the spot grocery lists, or just random reminders.  You can create as many as you like & you can color coordinate each one.  Would definitely recommend this app for the busy mom or organized assistant!
B008220BLG|5.0|At first I was finding it a bit hard to work out exactly what was the deal with the zombies in this one.  They were traditionally walking aimlessly through an airport with dazed looks on their face, grunting to one another like your movie norm zombie, but then R (as he would later become known) could open an airplane door, play old records, and obviously at some stage the zombies have got the generators going and maintained the power to the airport.  Then, well I don't know if I'd say I worked it out but I guess I just accepted whatever goes, goes, forgot to question it any longer in my mind and I ended up really enjoying this film.  It didn't hurt that his human kidnap victim was smoking hot (played by Teresa Palmer).  There are moments watching this where you're thinking, well if they have a BMW and can drive it, why doesn't she just drive it away herself and return to the humans.  Or where would she have got a weedwacker from in an airport terminal?<br /><br />It's a situation light comedy. R eats the brains of the boyfriend of Julie, a hot girl who is part of a reluctant scavenger group and obtains bits of the boyfriend's memory including his fondness for Julie.  He kidnaps/saves her by rubbing blood over her alive scent and drags her back to the abandoned airport where the zombies reside, and his room (a powered up airliner) on the tarmac.  He wants to feel more human (which is why zombies particularly enjoy eating brains, they feel human from the memories) and to make Julie his girlfriend.  Julie wants to return to the human base, but is beginning to realise that zombies aren't just brain dead human eating machines that her father, the military leader of the compound, has portrayed them as.  Nicholas Hoult plays an interesting high functioning zombie, but it is really his zombie best friend M (played by Rob Corddry who bring the fun vibe to the zombie masses).<br /><br />This Amazon product page lists the DVD as having no features, but the one I watched had plenty, in fact combined they went for longer than the film.  There's deleted scenes and a gag reel of course but also a lot of features on the behind the scenes stuff in Montreal. Such as casting, playing the zombies, shooting the movie, finding an abandoned airport, interviews with the author of the book, bringing the book to the screen (it's well done enough that I actually want to read the book now).  Theresa Palmer also shot a lot of footage with her own camera while the movie was being made and there's a feature of that footage.  Rob Corddry again steals the scenes in all these behind the scenes features, Teresa Palmer and Nicholas Hoult all seemed to be practical jokers and always having fun the whole time, making this features fun to watch. Interestingly everything was shot trying to push the limits but keep it a PG movie (although here in Australia it is rated M).  If you can a version with these features over a featureless DVD, it's worth the money.<br /><br />Warm Bodies is a refreshing spin on the same old zombie survival film we've become used to.  It doesn't obey the laws of the zombie universe, but that's why it works!enty, in fact combined they went for longer than the film.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|I am a huge fan of Cranford, North and South, anything Jane Austen and Downton Abbey.  I was looking for something new to watch.  My friend's sister lives in Canada and had easier access to BBC shows.  She recommended Lark Rise to Candleford.  I watched all 4 seasons in 4 days.  It has so many of the wonderful actors you have seen in other British classics.  It has comedy and drama and romance.  It has the struggle between classes.  It is not as dark or serious as North and South.  I enjoyed that. I loved, loved, loved this series and have been telling everyone I know.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Great fun, good acting - looking forward to Iron man 4. This is a  best bet for all ages. Loved it!
B0080K3G4O|3.0|A little long and repetitive, but a premise worth exploring.  Because I question the results of positive thinking, this book caught my interest.  I would give it 3.5 stars.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Perverted both of them, they deserve one another. To continue or not to continue is the question, huh, what to do.
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|You launch the monkey to collect Gems & Bananas.  Not all that entertaining.  I really don't play it, but maybe once a month.
B004ZH66XO|3.0|This is a very basic game graphic wise (basically not much more than coloured shapes representing fish).  Basically you eat smaller fish, which when you do turn into coins for a few seconds which you need to eat (move your fish over), meanwhile avoiding larger fish who want to eat you. Your game environment is a small fish bowl. Grow is certainly no Hungry Shark Evolution quality wise.  It's a very basic game both visually and play wise and not overly challenging.<br /><br />You don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi to play this once downloaded.  I always play games in airplane mode, I didn't get any of these adds to try and get me to buy stuff that other reviewers have commented about when it was played in airplane mode.  I can't see myself playing this one much, when you can do exactly the same thing in a much more fun, visually impressive ocean environment with Hungry Shark Evolution.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|As a fan of all things British and especially British TV series, I admit I didn't jump into this one quickly.  I was afraid of its &#34;Little House on the Prairie&#34; veneer.  When a colleague, a philosophy prof, recommended it, I thought I'd give it a shot.  I'm so glad I did!  Like most British drama, the characters---and in this case, ALL of them---are interesting and complex.  Though set in a particular period of British history, the issues addressed by these complex characters are truly timeless and, at the same time, current.  What is amazing is how those issues do not seem to be imposed upon the story line.  They ring true.  This series is particularly important and appealing because of its strong female leads who struggle with issues of independence but the often accompanying loneliness that brings.  I am a fan and I want to be Dorcas Lane when I grow up!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Excellent series: the acting was superb, it was suspenseful right up until the end, beautifully filmed.  Didn't want it to end, even though I HAD to know 'whodunit'!!  Hope they come back with a second season!
1465414444|5.0|This is such a wonderful little book. I say little oxymoronically because you could fell a dire boar with this thing. It is heavy and comes with a book sleeve to protect it from general damage.<br /><br />Think of it a bit like a light version of an encyclopedia with each page detailing a little bit of information about various aspects of Azeroth. If you enjoy artbooks and like knowing a bit about warcraft lore this is the book for you.
0345803485|5.0|[[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set]]I read the whole trilogy and was a fan. But HATE THE CASTING OF THE MOVIE.<br />WHAT IS EL JAMES THINKING?  She lost me as a fan.  Too bad .  It is not just me. every woman in my community feels the same way.  This author should rethink her casting.  After all it is all about money.
B004YXE438|5.0|There are times when you want to have a brain break.  This app is perfect for that. I love that you can choose the number of pieces along with the level of difficultly.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This story is so well crafted that each section seems to stand alone.  I'm reading them in order, so I don't know how hard it would be to start from the middle, but the characters and storyline are remarkable and enjoyable.
B00DYOOGYK|3.0|Cool game, especially for mobile. I have been enjoying it except for some glitches. For instance, the gyroscopes steering is the opposite, root right and car steers left, impossible to drive that way! Also game will occasionally freeze and exit to home screen.<br /><br />For the good parts, the story is just okay but you don't really pay this for the story. Graphics are good and there seems like a lot of stuff to do.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Have had a great time buying stuff for my dragons and the habitates. Oh and combining two dragons to get the one your hoping to hatch. Lots of fun and keeps me interested in trying to clear land and make room for more habitats.
B003274QH6|5.0|I realize this is just my opinion but this is thus far my favorite season of Breaking Bad (I have yet to see season 5).<br /><br />The pacing was perfect, the relationship between Walt and Pinkman is perfect, the arc is perfect.<br /><br />I can find basically nothing about this season that I didn't like. Perhaps the sister-in-law.<br /><br />I can make no promises for the rest of the show (though if you are a living human you will likely love it) but this first season is absolutely stellar.
B001R10BEG|5.0|Tom Hanks at his best with a great supporting cast. This movie is engaging for anyone, no matter what your age. A quality film with stellar performances.
B00F6NKFQK|3.0|Short stories, which I do not like.  Would be fine for someone with a short attention spacn or limited time for reading.  Read the first three stories and deleted it.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|It's a great family movie for someone with teenagers in the household.  I appreciated the theme of parents-children relationships, and, of course, we all enjoyed  many funny moments in the movie. .
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|this game is really addictive and you'll find that you lose track f time while playing it. can be a liitle frustrating because some of the items are small and can be hard to tell what they are.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Time is critical in today's fast paced world. When I need to decompress I like to watch a show with intelligent theme, good drama and talented acting.<br />Congratulations, well done.
0744014956|5.0|This guide is well designed both inside and out. Anytime I am staring at the game thinking to myself &#34;What was I suppose to be doing?&#34; or &#34;What does Chicken-Fingers even mean as an objective?!&#34; I can check the guide and find out within a minute.<br /><br />You could always just use the internet but I'll probably never stop being a fan of physical guides. There is something romantic about them.<br /><br />It's got a good deal of heft to it. If you judge your books by weight then I suspect you'll find this to be a solid purchase.
B005F3XVA8|5.0|One of the best comedies since Dr. Doolittle with Eddie Murphy.  A must see!  There is romance and endearing relationships betweens humans and animals.
B00F2LIV4E|2.0|All chops... no heart.  I've been a fan of DT for a long time,  but this album was disappointing.  With the exception of one track, it felt like they were trying to say &#34;look what I can do&#34; ...they didnt take us anywhere else musically.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I HATE the customer server at STORM8.  I am refusing to play any of their games.  I spent good money to buy gold and while playing my game quit responding and when it came back on 700 gold was gone.  I emailed Storm8 asking for them to help and after a week they finally replied and said \\"sorry we can't do anything for you\\".<br /><br />I'm very upset over this - I will never spend another penny on any game made by Storm8.  I hate you Storm8 and your stupid DragonStory.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Although I still like the first Iron Man movie, and the 2nd one is good, too, I find this third one full of action, intellectually interesting, and, again, sprinkled with some funny moments that Robert Downey, JR. is famous for, in this franchise.  It is my favorite now.<br /><br />There are references to the Avengers movie, so if you haven't seen it yet, you should watch that one, which is a very good movie.  I like it even more than this one.  If you can't or won't see Avengers before this one, don't worry - it will stand on its own - you'll just have to skip over the references.<br /><br />Character role changes and life changes in this story make it interesting.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|An incredible story from so many points of view.  Well written and I hope there will be at least one more to follow.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Same GRRM while things are stretching out a bit the story is still the same great story that you have come to expect.
B00005R5G9|5.0|I highly recommend any movie like this that is light hearted and fun. Great performances by some well known actors. How often do you see James Spader play such a silly character?  I love this movie! It makes me feel good every time I watch it.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Wool was a totally surprising pleasure.  The way the story is told is unusual (don't get too attached to your lead characters) and at times shocking.  I enjoyed the concept and could not put the three books in the series down.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Pure emotion...simple and deep. For those who love to feel and naturally \\"notice the universe\\" around them. Thank you, John Green for writing this book!
B009VIZDLI|1.0|The Rosie Project was an unrealistic waste of words and kindle space , a silly  fictional stereotypical  tiresome story trying to portray a character who is (I think) autistic or suffering from Aspbergers (this aspect is hidden in a muddled cloud of uncertainty)  it was like the author was trying to reinvent Sheldon Cooper from the \\"Big Bang Theory\\" and do it badly . I also ask why do authors find this disorder or behaviour so funny or quirky it must just be painfully crippling !
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Movie takes off right out of the gate and doesn't let up. Great take on a zombie apocalypse. I know a lot of people didn't like the ending but I felt like it was creative and a little different take on this subject and the ending was purposely done for obvious reasons. If you like these kinds of movies, this one is right up there.  Two thumbs up!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Thus show is additive! Great acting, riveting plot, steady action vs drama.<br />Don't miss out any longer!<br />See what everyone is talking about.
B002WN8IQQ|5.0|Sometimes people meet the love of their life and ride the wave of adventure together for a lifetime.  I love this story of Johnny Cash and June Carter, how they met, what they accomplished together, and how they were meant to be one.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't say enough about how much I love Downton.  I simply can't wait for January when the 4th season starts.  My dilemma is should I watch the episodes week by week or wait for the season to b over and buy the season, so I can watch them without having to wait each week to see what unfolds.  enjoy
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Amazon was unable to deliver the video at the time we requested it.  Tried three times and gave up.  Ordered from DishNet Pay Per View instead.<br /><br />Usually Amazon delivers, but unfortunately, not this time and we were unable to wait as we had company who were with us for a short period of time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't express how much I enjoyed it, beyond enjoyment!  Heading to Season 3 to be ready for January 5th & Season 4.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I liked this movie because it gives further insight to the characters of the original Star Trek. It has very good action scenes and the plot is easily followed.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The Kindle Android phone app is wonderful  for reading when I don't want to carry my bigger Kindle paperwhite with me. The reading quality is perfectly fine for reading indoors, on the subway train ride, etc.  If I'm going to be reading outdoors, I would want to be sure to carry the paperwhite which can't be beat of course.  Or if I feel there are going to be dangerous situations, then I would opt for the paperwhite because the smart phones are such a tempting target for thieves.
B00BC0PEEY|5.0|What a fantastic cast and story.  Her you have suspense and comic relief in perfect harmony. unbelievably great variety of characters working together! I had to upgrade when this movie became available on blu ray.  There is such great chemistry between these great actors.  One of River Phoenix's best roles.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|VERY nice soft velvety binder that is well made with pics of all the girls and a well organized binder with all seasons! Glad I got the complete series all together compared to individual series. Nice quality and has bonus features disc too! I'm addicted to Sex and the City so it's great to watch it over and over. Would suggest this complete set to EVERYONE! BUY IT!!! &#60;3
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great. My children play it non stop. They say they look forward to playing when they get home from school every day
B0038AUY96|4.0|This novel was nice and creepy. Some new characters were introduced. They are none of them as engaging as the main character, Harry Hole. Which makes you wonder - maybe this is an element that would (dare I say) improve the series? I was a bit tired of Rakel and Oleg by the end of this novel. Will be happy to see them take the back seat in the next and perhaps future instalments.
0812973992|5.0|Very very well written and intriguing how all the interesting variety of characters all come together. Hated to see it end. Read it!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Brad Pitt does not disappoint with an understated performance that makes zombies a very real possibility! I highly recommend it!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I'm continually amazed with the world that Rothfuss has created. There was one arc that seemed a bit much, but the story still kept me enthralled.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great app.  It replaced three apps. Definitely worth the money.  Info is organized in logical way with all readily available
B0063IH60K|4.0|I loved this game!  It beats the old fashion way any day. I just wish I could get rid of the commercials.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't even know where to start, this book was amazing. I cried so much while reading about this wonderful people that now that I'm done I'm gonna miss them. I recommend this book to anybody who thinks their life is tough or unfair because even though we always hear or see this kids with cancer, to actually read about their life really changes the way you think about the way you live your. I hate to sound like Hazel but I really do wish I could find out what happened to her, when she died and what she did until her last days, did Van Houten write her a eulogy?
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik really let me down I was signed out for no reason. I tried for two days(now going on three)to log in but instead I keep getting &quot;Login Failed This Is Taking Longer Than It Should. You Should Try Again In A Bit.&quot; I waited, tried again, and got the same thing. I thought it was the wifi so I turned it off then turned off my tablet for at least 5-10 minutes, turned everything on, and got the same thing. I tried to reset my password but I couldnt even do that. I even uninstalled it at least 3 times and when I install it again, I'm getting the same message. I even put my password in wrong to see if that's the problem and I got the same message. I asked some of my friends too and they said they're not having the same problem. I didn't give away my password either, if I did my twitter, facebook, tumblr, instagram, and youtube would be gone because I use the same password for everything. Kik is either somehow doing this on purpose or there truly is a problem keeping me from logging in. If anybody has had the same problem and knows what I should do, please DM me on Twitter @Lol_Stfu. Thankyou. :)
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|Really?  You are much better than this.  It will be awhile before I  look to you for a good romance.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is so fun  but I do not no how to expand and I am on level 8  how do you is there a quest? Get this game
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I have actually seen all the seasons of pretty little liars and had been saying I wanted to read the books to see the difference in them! I have found it!! The tv series is somewhat following with the book but I think I am going to like the book at little bit more!! :) already got the second one can't wait
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|I don't like the story . Didn't stick to the comic book store .  Next movie need to be better
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book changed my life! I never realized how important sexual pleasure actually was! This book causes so much reflection on the truth of our desires. What an amazing read!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe is a reallyneat show. The whole family finds it interesting (mom, dad, and 18 yr old daughter). The guy who plays Walter is amazing. Wait till you get to season 5.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Awesome!!! One if my favorite movies!!  Great for the whole family!  A must see movie...my son had watched it probably 20 times now!
B00EJ2WBX4|5.0|By far my favorite album of the year. Pop music with depth and heart. Very nostalgic, but better than the 80's music it reminds me of.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This game is not good at all. I think minecraft is better.I tried it but it was toatally stupid. Survivalcraft is copying minecraft. Stupd Candy Rufus Games!
0440237688|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I borrowed The Giver from my library's e-book collection.  It had been on my 'to read' list for quite a while but I never made it a priority.  \\"It's a children's book.  Will I really get anything from reading it?\\"  I wish I hadn't waited so long as this book is a treasure.<br /><br />SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD:<br /><br />Jonas is about to turn twelve.  In his world, you are given your assignment at your 12th year ceremony.  The elders have watched you and determined your skills so that you can be trained to become a doctor, lawyer, teacher, etc.  As Jonas watches all of his friends getting their assignments, he realizes that they have skipped him.  At the end of the ceremony, he is called forward and told that he has been selected as the next Giver, a rare honor.  Unsure what this means, Jonas begins his training the following day.<br /><br />The world that Lois Lowry has created may seem ideal to many.  Everyone is basically equal and there is little to no discord among the people.  In fact, no one really knows about pain and suffering.  Yes, you might slam your finger in the door but someone will come right over to give you pain relief.  But, true pain is unknown.  War, famine, political unrest - none of these exist in this world.<br /><br />What do you give up for this utopia?  Pretty much all free will.  The government tells you when to play, what you are going to do with your life, who will be your mate.  And, by mate, I simply mean companion as you are also required to take pills that eliminate all of your 'urges'.<br /><br />I avoid online political discussions at all costs as I think those are best left for debate in person.  However, I do believe that no matter your political leanings, The Giver is thought-provoking.  If we are going to give the government power over certain aspects of our lives, we should consider the long-term benefits and dangers.  I'm sure there are those that have no issue with government control if it means peace.  Others would fight to the death to avoid living under someone else's thumb.<br /><br />The Giver is the person who holds all of the negative memories of the world.  He is charged with remembering what it is to die during a war or freeze to death during an avalanche.  Yes, he keeps some good memories too but the weight of the negative ones is a hardship few can endure.<br /><br />Jonas' story doesn't have a happy ending.  If you want that, you should go read some Dr. Seuss.<br /><br />5/5 stars for a book I will give to all of my nieces and nephews.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I wanted to revisit the journeys, I have to say it was good to see all the characters. One of the better series. Hoped for a better series finale but all good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so fun and it shows me more things I can do with my horse
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I read this book in a day because I couldn't put it down. I loved how it was written from the guy's prospective. It was humorous and real!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I finished this game fast but it was still loads of fun. I was stumped on a few rooms but I can't wait for more rooms.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I just loved this book. Made me feel so many emotions I haven't felt in so long. Hope that one day I will find one just as good.
B00D23K0MU|5.0|This a very good cd by Maysa'.  Sounds good and enjoyable to listen to.  I listen to it all the time.
B006MPKDD6|5.0|Great storyline and suspense waiting to find out who 'the follower' was. Court scenes are incredibly well written as always.
B0010TBPJU|5.0|Superb cast, strong music and as quirky a topic as it gets. Loved Hedwig and I think it is a must see.

B009NQZVKG|5.0|Excellent. James Rollins is my favorite author. I love this series of books. I cannot wait for the next installment.
0345803485|1.0|Horrible. This is a teen girl's idealization of a \\"relationship\\". I was so uncomfortable reading it-not for the sex, but for the cringe-worthy blushing maiden moments. Gag! Couldn't even get halfway through.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great writing. Well drawn characters and a unique story. One of those stories where you really don't know what may happen next.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really like this game. I downloaded it and now I can't stop playing it. Thank God it doesn't have a time limit like the other G5 games. But overall I am a fan of their hidden object games and this one I would really recommend.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Must have Kindle app.  Makes going to Bigby's a lot more fun.  Hopefully they (Bigby's) won't cut you off after an hour.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I don't think it's good as The Hunger Games, but still very good. I found it to be a little predictable and not as subtle as the first. It is however, at least ten fold better than Mockingjay. Nevertheless, I found myself falling into the story and the characters and unwilling to put it down.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|I have to admit that I am 40 and I love this show! The whole family shares some laughs at the antics Shaun the Sheep and his band of farm animals do as they live day to day life at the farm. This tongue and cheek comedy will be sure to get your spirits high and your belly laughing!
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Dad clone of the original good actors wrong script no justice to the original except the title and thats all
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I had been a fan of mahjong for many years, I just got my  game today and I am having a great time playing this game!!!!!!!!!

B000HX4ZF6|5.0|This is a very good movie, have watched several times and will watch again and again in the near future
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is very helpful in keeping me aware of the amount of power and time I have available to me for various uses on my Kindle. This way, I'm never caught with no power in the middle of a good read. Well worth the download.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|great show with lively characters and a story you can believe is real....The actors are believable and the kids acting is great
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works perfectly. I was surprised how fast and effectively it cleans. Am playing a lot of games which are greedy in question of device memory but with this program it is not an issue anymore.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|This was great.  Really an upbeat positive feel good movie, with great visuals and excitement.  Exceptionally well written, the plot has plenty of twists all through.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|It was amazing!!! Best iron man movie by far!!! Robert Downey JR really is the best marvel character that actually seems like he is Tony Stark. :)
B00594XOZU|3.0|It glitches out and if you delete it you won't be able to sign in to your account it will say that it's is taking longer than it should and it won't let you make a new account. But before it was a very good app (kindle fire HD)
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I honestly do not know what took me so long to read this series...I love it! A Feast for Crows was a little different from the previous three books in that it seemed more about the characters setting up strategies rather than fighting bloody wars (all though was still quite a bit of violence).<br /><br />One reason that A Feast for Crows is so different from the previous books is that as George RR Martin was finishing book four, he and his publishers realized that it was nearing 1800 pages and someone made the decision to break it up into two books. In order to make the two book option work, Martin decided to split the two books up by location while keeping plot events running simultaneously in both books. A Feast for Crows focuses on the southern settings/characters and A Dance of Dragons focuses on the northern settings. In addition to the regular southern characters (like Cersei, Jaimie, and Sansa/Alayne), Martin also introduces a few new characters via their own POV chapters. Some I liked, some I didn't, some left me even more confused (but isn't that just like Martin?
B001NLL93W|5.0|I really enjoyed it this book. The characters are the best part. But it is also a fun adventure to follow.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|A Game where thought and cleverness and determination and looking at a problem from ALL angles is needed.  A very interesting story line as well. GREAT FUN!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book is a great rainy day book BUT it needed more....the love scenes were a bit lacking and the end was rather lacking I wanted to keep reading but it ended and at 90% complete on my kindle the book started with a sub mini book *sigh* which I feel like should not have even been in this book BUT overall it was a great read for a rainy day Sunday
B00F35B8F8|3.0|Interesting movie with a lot of cliches.  Honestly it took awhile for this sequel, almost too long.  Overall it was fun, funny and basically a Wraith of Kahn type of ending.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Very innovative and successful writing style, a great book full of excellent and completely real characters - definitely worth reading.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I liked Hosseini's collage of stories that made the tapestry of interconnected families.  His characters evoke a richness of feeling for the reader, and he deftly carries a theme, place, family throughout the book.  Well worth reading - and reading again.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|This is the best movie in the franchise. There is no question about it. With the past movies, James Bond was becoming lager than life with all the crazy gadgets that oozes out laser from the watches, cars that go invisible and fighting sequence that's too predictable. But then arrives Casino Royale to the theatres and brings back Bond to the basics. This is the movie about making of bond and it beats every other bond movie hands down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Absolutely love it. I can literally play this game allllllllllll day and never get tired of the minions!!people should definitely play
B009ZQJ0ME|5.0|Are not in this movie. Absolutely astonishing movie. I could watch it over and over. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
B00EMJD6TC|1.0|Weak plot and ridiculous story line.  Save your money and wait for the Walking Dead to start if you need your zombie fix.
B000NQRE9Q|1.0|I would love to have one of the best movies ever made, Raiders of the Lost Ark, on Blu-Ray, but can't buy it except as part of this collection?  I consider the original a masterpiece, but the other movies in the series are complete garbage.  I really dislike that they tied them together, it just feels like a trick... like they knew a lot of people wouldn't buy the other ones unless they had to in order to get the original great film.  I don't recommend purchasing until they just release #1 alone.
B00003CXC6|3.0|This DVD was required as part of a film viewing class.  The Japanese language film had many options for viewing - original, voice over in English, subtitles - etc.  It's the story of a murder with several different testimonies presented in an effort to determine what really happened.  Resolution of the verdict is left to the opinion of the viewer.  The film is black and white.  Cinematography is not its strong point - but the format and the scripting is interesting.
B00BRUPICM|4.0|Well written, though sometimes a bit weird. I am still reading it, and looking forward to the conclusion. I have no idea how it will turn out.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Sweet and unique.  Looked forward to reading more each day.  Didn't want the story to end.  Th character became part of my day. Good read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It's great to continue with these great characters while meeting new ones. A compelling read from cover to cover. Ken Follett is brilliant.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book should held your attention. Chapter after chapter. Can't wait to read book 2 and find out if they get together again.
B005MMY5RK|5.0|I viewed this movie for a film class, but had seen it before.  It is truly a masterpiece of cinematography and scripting.  Orson Welles plays the title role superbly and keeps the viewer connected to the main character by revealing certain weaknesses in the strong façade presented by Kane - weakness that tie him back to a young, vulnerable child.  The entire movie sets out to answer a question.  In the end, it is answered.
B000I0XLYO|1.0|This movie was a total waste of my time.  No redeeming value at all.  I do not recommend this film.
1476727651|3.0|Although I'd like to, I can't really join in with enthusiastic praise that \\"Doctor Sleep\\" has gotten.  Don't get me wrong, it's eminently readable I suppose and there is an intriguing battle between good and evil in it.  It's just that \\"the Shining\\" (both the movie and the book) were just such magnificent pieces of horror fiction and so jarringly terrifying, it's hard to see how any sequel could live up to it.<br /><br />And sad to say, \\"Doctor Sleep\\" doesn't even come close.  Why is that?  Because in \\"the Shining,\\" we had the Overlook Hotel, a unique creation of King's that manages to be a villain, setting, and predicament all at once:<br /><br />the villain:  To me, the Overlook just oozed with evil and malevolence...and what made it so scary to me was its insidious attack on Jack Torrance's sanity before all the paranormal fireworks began to kick in.  Also, King left it to the readers' imagination as to why the Overlook was so awful and what the agenda of its real \\"managers\\" were.<br /><br />the setting:  Apart from Hill House or one of H.P. Lovecraft's creations, can anyone imagine a more spooky physical setting than a beautiful old hotel with such a sinister history?<br /><br />the predicament:  I think the literary term for a story like the \\"the Shining\\" is a \\"bottle story\\" where a group of characters are placed in an isolated setting where they are in immense danger.  What's worse than being in a haunted hotel?  How about being in a haunted hotel and totally cut off from civilization with a man who is slowly losing his sanity?<br /><br />Contrast this with the villains of \\"Doctor Sleep\\"<br /><br />&lt;spoilers><br /><br />The itinerant tribe of child murdering paranormal \\"RV people\\" known as the True Knot just doesn't come across as particularly scary to me.  In some ways, they're too close to being normal (i.e. they often express emotions that are human; they have a few psychic powers but also are mortal and fallible).  In other ways, I found them wildly unbelievable (it's one thing to think of a place like the Overlook being in existence but dozens of people who roam North America in RVs abducting and torture-murdering children at will and nobody is the wiser?)<br /><br />And the thing is:  I don't even find the True Knot a terribly original villain.  Frankly, Dan Simmons did the \\"secret society of mental vampires\\" story in a far more compelling and horrifying way in \\"Carrion Comfort.\\"  I can't recommend that book strongly enough.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0312567073 Carrion Comfort]]<br /><br />&lt;end spoilers><br /><br />So I reluctantly conclude that \\"Doctor Sleep\\" is just not a fitting sequel to \\"the Shining.\\"  If I had had occasion to speak to Stephen King before he set out on the project that resulted in this book, I would have urged him to build a sequel around his short story \\"1408.\\"  In that case, it's not a haunted hotel but a single haunted room in a hotel...but the evil that dwells there is every bit on the same level as \\"the Shining.\\"  What a great sequel that would have made, Dan Torrance checks into that hotel room.  Too bad King never ran with that idea.<br /><br />Please note:  I'm providing the link to the King collection of short stories that contains \\"1408.\\"  I don't recommend bothering with the movie version of it since obscene liberties with the overall plot are taken with it that greatly diminish the power of the story.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0743457358 Everything's Eventual: 14 Dark Tales]]evable (it's one thing to think of a place like the Overlook being in existence but dozens of people who roam North America in RVs abducting and torture-murdering children at will and nobody is the wiser?)<br /><br />And the thing is:  I don't even find the True Knot a terribly original villain.

B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I recommend this book to any one that has lost a loved one to dementia. It's not complicated, it's easy to do, get rid of sugar and grain eat good fat, loose weight and save your brain! It's easy NOT to do anything too...if you give it 30 dedicated days, you will feel and look better. Do it!
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|this game does not work properly on kindle fire because it cannot detect sound for flying the airplane and you cant do the stop the bleeding when the moose gets shot because it does not let you have more than 2 fingers on the screen at a time. otherwise I love this game because I play it on my friends ipad.
B00ESLTAW6|2.0|I have read Jane Austen books before and enjoyed the stories, even though the language is &#34;old style&#34;.  This story just didn't have enough to it to be enjoyable.  I finished the book, so I can discuss it with my book club.  If it weren't for the book club, I would have put it down early on.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I am glad I discovered a new author. The plot and settings are very good, I just wish the main characters were a bit less &#34;characters out of a romance novel.&#34;
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Need to open up more levels. It is a real good puzzle game. Haven't found another game like this one
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a very enjoyable book. My subway rides to and from work went by so fast while reading this book. This is the first book I read by this author and looking forward to reading more. Each character in this book is engaging and you care what happens to them.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|These books are great reads! Can't put them down, so buying all four together was a great deal! Hope to buy more bundles in the future.
B000HL09SA|5.0|Great family show reminiscent of a simpler life and time. Shot in my hometown of Canton MS, this film is perfect for family movie night. Keep the tissue handy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't stop watching. Almost feel like part of the family.  You hate them and you love them.  I can't wait for the next season.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Great product!  Packaging was in great shape, and the product included every piece... including the spare pieces.  Thanks again for the great service.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|This movie is about clones of tom cruise. and tom cruise fighting tom cruise and tom cruise eventually defeating tom cruise.<br /><br />what the f is this shit.  icant believe i paid for this. I usually like Tom C movies but.  whtever.  It had morgan freeman in it so those parts were enjoyable.
B0063M22QO|4.0|These puzzles make me relax and slow down if slows the speed I'm feeling,<br />Give it .a try, you will love it!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind, and a willingness to make positive changes to their life path.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I picked up a book, and was immediately back where I grew up at: Wyoming.  Mr. Johnson has it down. Lakes, Rivers, Counties, Highway Patrol, Cheyenne, Rawlins, abutting states, where everything is relative to each other in the state... And, it's a great Mystery / Detective Book at that.
B0019IIPXQ|5.0|An interesting Sci-Fi film that started The Chronicles and only gained it's following on DVD. It plays on the human fear of the dark and what may emerge on a planet with no light.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is amazing you need to get it you really do idk what's so fun about it is just addicting
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|The acting, the scenery and the plot are all amazing!! I found the first episode a little difficult to get through, only because alot happens that the watcher doesn't understand. I.e. opening scene of racing through a desert in an RV, with the driver in his underwear, passenger fully clothed with a gas mask on and two dead bodies in the back, seemed to me to be a plot similar to one of my 12 yr olds &#34;random&#34; cartoons from cartoon network.<br /><br />Once you get through the first episode, and the loose ends are pulled together, the series is awesome... Don't start watching if you don't have ALOT of free time....
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Love this program!  Very effective way to learn other languages. Easy way to use spare times to a good end.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|OK, I'm going to say the same thing over and over. The Harry Potter Books are FABULOUS. I use them in my Medical Practice to encourage reading and to have those I work with compare their situation in life to those in the books. And, I give reading assignments out of these books. And I use the Movies as well with assignments given to those I'm trying to engage with.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love it...no words to describe, you just have to watch it. Writers minds are brilliant...if you are a true fan of horror, this is it for you.
B003TQ50V6|5.0|Silverado is one of my all time favorite westerns, I just really like this movie and always recommend it whenever someone asks what my favorite westerns are.
B00BH0VSM6|2.0|The plot is sketchy and illogical.  This was his first book and was obviously only printed because of later successes.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is better than any game ever it has tons of cars it has a lot of tracks it is awesome
B000FBFMIO|5.0|I read the Farseer Trilogy 3-4 years before reading this book, and the Liveship Traders trilogy about two years before.  This is another excellent book set in that world.  We pick up with the characters from the \\"Assassin\\" books about 15 years after we left them.  If you didn't read those first, I think you'd have much of the background laid out for you here; however, I think you'd be better off if you had read those books (as I had).<br /><br />I had a hard time stopping reading this once I started.  The well-telegraphed death of a major character still made me cry.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love the video but the game awesome :) I LOVE this game  so much nothing bad about it P.S DON'T  PRESS THE RED BUTTON
B00EYAMEX8|5.0|It is something you have never heard before but I instantly fell in love with the album and could relate to each song.
B002SJ8FH6|5.0|I watched the last hour of this on TV and decided to see the beginning of it on Amazon Instant.  I really enjoyed it.  So many of the old movies are much better than the new stuff that is coming out.  Especially Hitchcock!
B00F2362IE|3.0|I have thus game fornmy iphone and my kindle.  I originally bought the ipod version and loved it.  its a really fun game and my son loves the turtles.  however the kindle version crashes too often to really be fun.
B0060D35BC|5.0|When I saw this in a movie theatre, I was enthralled with the strong grafics and (believe it or not) story plot!<br />After seeing the New Tron (Legend) I wanted to see the old (?) version again and see if it was as I remembered!!<br /> My Only problem was I thot I ordered a DVD, Not an Electronic DownLoad that I will be only able to view a Few times~
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a great match three game .find it very hard to put it down. my kids love when I play  they usually get a yes because I'm so I involved with game
B005T87QCI|5.0|This game is bad ass everyone should by it. I would buy it if it was three bucks<br />I do wish zous twin cities gridlock and all the other robots in the game were free.<br />You have to buy the.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Game is a lot of fun, especially with the story to keep you engaged.  Dialog can be a little excessive at times, but you can always skip it if you're not interested in reading it at the moment.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|It's The Doctor. What more do you need to know? It's simply the best.  Watch it. Love it. But be ready to watch every season.
B005721W9O|5.0|Shared the fun of this movie with my fan geek kids. They're into a different kind of show but totally get the passion of fandoms!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Love the songs on the album always have been a Britney Spears fan and this album did not disappoint and love almost every track on it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan Train - it sounds cliche and hokey - but this book grabbed me with its story of abandoned children in their journeys to becoming resilient adults.  A lovely story, full of promise to those of us who may feel desperation about the rebellious teenagers we know.  May they all meet someone who is willing and able to see beyond the tough shells and find the real potential inside.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Never thought I would enjoy a program like these even though I love PBS. It won me over from the first episode
B003H4I4JU|2.0|I chose two stars instead of one star because I keep hoping that at some point, this book will pick the pace or become interesting or the characters will become vaguely likable. But the problem is that so far the characters are uninteresting and have nothing to do with the original characters from Enders Game. I pick it up. I read for I bit, I am bored to tears. I have repeated this cycle three or four times now and am unsure as to whether or not I am going to try to read any farther.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Enjoyed this in the theater. Was just as good the second time around! Well done story, few missed beats, definitely recommend!
B003E6LC6I|3.0|Great acting , good story line (s) but I am really annoyed by all the &#34;3 days ago, 2 hours from now&#34; skipping around.  Still worth a look.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Even though I figured out the killer in the fifth episode or maybe the sixth, I thought the series was very good. The acting was fantastic<br />from all parties. Even though I live here in the states I am very fond of British T. v. Without giving any details of the show because of spoilers I might give this is a really good television mystery. I know you will enjoy it if you like brass detectives and who done it type mysteries. I probably would have given it three stars but watching these actors was like being there and observing their lives.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Great book. Demille delivers another John Corey thriller. I got hooked on this series a month ago and have subsequently read all five books. Didn't want to put any of them down.
B003WKOTXE|5.0|This is a documentary that was produced over several years and follows the birth and early years of four different babies in four different parts of the world.  It is a beautifully done documentary that is rivetingly interesting.  It comes a across as a true work of love.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.  I do not normally enjoy documentaries and I tend to lose interest quickly.  But I have seen this one twice, now, and would enjoy seeing it yet a third time.<br /><br />If you like real babies, you will love &#34;Babies.&#34;
B004MPESSY|5.0|The more horror movies I watch, the more I realize this is one of the best ones I've seen in recent years.<br /><br />Very very creative. A work of art. I'll have to watch the original someday.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|It isn't fancy but it has multiple ti[s making it easy to find the one you prefer to use.  The shirt clip comes in handy and the black color helps it look like just another pen in your pocket. Of course, it is about the size of a pen and not as large as some of the other styli I have tried, which I like.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Go on Youtube and type in &quot;how to get instagram on your kindle fire hd&quot; and the video is by &quot;thomaslover10&quot; just follow those easy steps and get KIK Messenger back it works!  I did it myself because it won't let anyone log in. Hope this helps :)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Like the old angry birds...still fun.  Free is a great price and it down loads quickly ..even to my cheap tablet
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Really interesting, love this doctor, interested to watch the rest, 2nd season has started out quite well. Love it!! Watch it :)
B0064MGU98|5.0|Excellent characters, writing and storyline. Fun to watch, but leads to interesting discussions afterward and will give you plenty to think about.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|But it's restaurant story, where you can make different foods, breakfast foods, lunch foods, dinner and snack foods.  My favorites are French toast and bacon and eggs.
B00ATDOVNK|1.0|YET ANOTHER GAME FROM G5 that would not open. I'm glad I read the reviews. No more wasted time on a company that doesn't deliver what it promises. If it's a half game that's free, say so. Like I said, I'll stay away from G5 like it's the plague.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun. My kids and I really enjoy it. I love that you can get items with bananas. I am so happy you don't have to buy anything. Just keep playing and eventually you can get anything. Love it.
B006FPFTMS|4.0|It is a light program. It does not uses much memory or CPU load of my Asus Google Nexus 7.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|I love this book. Been working this program for about a year and a half, and heading into my mid 40's I'm as strong as I was (or stronger) than during my weightlifting days in my 20's - and with a lot less joint pain.<br /><br />It's the ultimate minimalist guide to getting strong. You literally need no equipment, except a chinup bar, some towels and a basketball. The progressions start so easy that anyone (yes, anyone) can do these exercises at first. But the last steps in the progressions may take you years to reach.<br /><br />I work out anywhere and everywhere using these techniques. All you need is some dedication, willpower and ... to enjoy looking and feeling strong. This book is worth far more than whatever the cost you are paying for it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Highly recommended.  This is a comprehensive and systematic way to understand about Steve Jobs.  He is a great man in terms of inventing the things that people desired.  Thank u.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Downtown Abbey in the city with more drama. Acting is great, costumes are beautiful, the pace keeps you wanting more.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Picked this up yesterday partially because it was free, turns out I have spent quite a bit of time playing it already.  Surprisingly enjoyable.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|I like to think of this film as Tony Stark does Batman.  The suit is set aside and Tony play detective.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a true story. Have played it for all dog lovers and they have all bought the movie too. This shows the dogs love for their owners. It is sad and you will cry. Really a great true story.
1608862801|1.0|The show is so stupid and now oh my gosh they got a comic book so don't waste your money on this crap go buy a superman or spiderman or batman comic book not this one its a huge waste of time and money
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The book was great..all that I expected and more...waited for it to be released...excellent....my daughter also reading it..on her kindle..will read it again..as I read the Shining..years ago..
B00CUG8GAS|5.0|This book was highly engrossing. Well written and poignant. I recommend it to anyone. A fascinating look at  growing up in a weird family
B00BTHWFEC|5.0|Please go get this one folks...old school sounds great and doesn't have to have 21 songs on it to be good! Trust me! Buy it!
B007RFDQN4|5.0|Jr. is masterful as Chaplin. Supporting cast is also very compentent in there interpretation of the world around them and their relationship with one the greatest actors of our time.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle Fire because my grandson is a big fan of Angry Birds. He played it all afternoon and had a ball.
B003SJ6W4I|3.0|My Grand Daughter had a ball with all the animals she saw doing crazy things. Wanted to watch it again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome the best horse game game by far absolute awesomeness The Best  -brooke Morgan and awesome clearness and  great pixels
B006GZ8OFQ|5.0|This isn't the usual type of literature I like to read. But it came recommended by Nora Efron. Once I started I was immersed in the writing style and the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read
B007IXWL2C|5.0|it was a riveting book and I would recommend  it to others  it was a book you can't put down and can't wait to see the movie
0783225733|1.0|The \\"100th Anniversary Edition\\" thing made me scratch my head? But this is a very good movie. How can it miss with the cast and crew that it has?
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put this down once I started reading. Writing is at a fairly simple level, but the storyline is compelling.
B009FXIICK|5.0|Like other reviewers have pointed out, this game is a lot like Bejewled, just with a slightly different objective. Normally I dislike those types of games, but there was something different and more captivating about this app than any other that I have tried before. Maybe it's the cheery music, maybe the mind-numbingly adorable animals, or maybe just that I appreciate that I got the app for free. Whatever it is, I think a lot of people who like cute animals and challenging obstacles will enjoy this game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|it will keep you reading and wanting more  A FRIEND RECOMMENDED IT AND I AMGLAD SHE DID  I would recommend it to others
B008KE3960|5.0|I got hooked within a matter of minutes. All the characters (planes) are pretty unique. Also many different strategies you can plan to win.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Could not put this down. Had to keep reading until the very end. Writing is at a fairly basic level, but a great storyline.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Love this time!! Have to wait awhile for the energy to refill but totally worth it.<br />Like how the objects are always moved around in the picture.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book and not just for sci-fi geeks. It has a well thought out and original plot with good flow of the storyline. Enjoyed it more the second time then I did the first.
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|Imaginative sci-fi storyline with lots of metaphorical situations. A real wake up call for 21st century life. Don't miss this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Play this app if you like a horse game its awesome for people who like a horse pet cool get.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|This is a good book. It helped me talk to my son about `normal' survival situations, without looking paranoid, but instead treating the idea of preparing for fire, earthquake, etc, as fun.
1451695195|4.0|For a medical or scientific person to admit that there is something out there beyond what they can touch or see or comprehend is a rare thing. And for this very same person to go beyond and come back to tell it all is even rarer. Dr Alexander is right - it is hard, almost impossible to describe the journey and what was seen there for how can one adequately describe the Creator and the places in between?<br /><br />For those who scoff at this book, ask yourself this: How can you so easily dismiss this when anything is possible? How can you so easily disbelief just because you have not experienced it? How can you assume that this is untrue just because science cannot explain everything under the sun? And worse, how can you call this a lie just because it was not written word for word in some great book?<br /><br />Some things will always remain a mystery and Dr Alexander has tried his best to describe his experience of this one great mystery.<br /><br />A wonderful read for those with an open mind and those who want to know more than the obvious.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Loved this movie! Lots of action and a good story. I love that it came with bonus footage too. A must see
B004I1WIWU|5.0|I have to be honest.  I have the CD which I love so didn't open the record. I am keeping for collecting. Adele is one of only modern artists that I have really gotten into so seemed right to get the vinyl to add to my 9000 collection! A bit more expensive then what I usually find at thrift stores or estate sales but still worth it!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was full of very poetic descriptions and narration. The story was heartbreaking, but it was also peppered with a good does of fun mischief and unique friendships. Of course, anything set during the Holocaust is expected to be tragic, but this tale felt more whimsical being told from Death's point of view. I really adored it, all the way around, even though I would have preferred a somewhat happier ending. I'll definitely be rereading this one, and I'm looking forward to the movie!
B00CISAPJS|4.0|We loved the movie family of kids 11+ a lil violence but no too scary for us. I wouldn't let kids watch it before we preapproved it first.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This is a terrific game. It seems cliche to use the word \\"addictive\\" because of the \\"sugar\\" connection, so I will stick with \\"entertaining\\" and \\"fascinating\\". Using a finger, the player draws routes for sugar granules to fall into mugs. The first level is pretty easy, but the challenge quickly escalates. I have played levels that I determined were completely impossible, then 5 or 15 or 50 tries later -- I made it! This HAS to be good for your brain. Downloaded to Nexus with no problems.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is so much fun yo finally find a game that is not a waste of time! Every new level becomes a little more challenging!  Great fun!
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I'm very happy with this application.  I looks the same as Facebook on the Kindle, without an application, but the big difference happens when uploading or sharing.  When I share something , it uploads in seconds, instead of minutes.
B001MTENOC|5.0|I very much love this book of shared insights into real life regression stories..<br />I mostly find it beautiful how one woman who had in all her lifetimes lived,  met her soulmate and him being the One and only soulmate who re appeared in her lifetime as representing as the same soul for these men from physical form..<br /><br />Definitely a one of a kind book I was previously recommended for.<br /><br />Lovely Michael Newton!  :)
B009JZSC9S|5.0|The writing and performances are top shelf .  I just started the series looking forward to upcoming episodes to enjoy

0142419400|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss is a book unlike any I've ever read before. Yes it is a young adult romance, but it is so well written that it must exceed the expectations of anyone who reads this genre. Anna is forced to attend a Parisian boarding school by her father, an author of best-selling cheesy love stories somewhere along the lines of Nicholas Sparks. While this would be a dream come true for a lot of teenagers, Anna does not want to leave home and her friends to move to a country where she does not speak the language. When she arrives she is immediately befriended by Meredith who is also a student at the school. Meredith introduces Anna to her friends Rashmi, Josh and of course St Clair. And so begins Anna's Parisian adventure.<br /><br />I loved the characters in this story so much! All of them were so well fleshed out especially, of course, Anna and St. Clair. Anna's character development was so well shown, with her growing from a teenager who hates Paris to a mature woman who understands and forgives her friends, and herself, their faults. She comes to value her year in Paris for what it is, an amazing opportunity to experience culture, make new friends and simply find her way on her own.<br /><br />St Clair was an amazingly well written love interest, with many problems of his own. His mistakes and redemptions are human and thoroughly realistic. I have never fallen in love with a character as quickly and easily as I did Etienne St Clair! The relationship between Anna and St Clair was so very realistic. No unrealistic insta-love here, though there is insta-attraction which is all too common. Their relationship had its ups and downs but you never stop rooting for the two of them.<br /><br />Rashmi, Meredith, Josh and Ellie, St Clair's girlfriend, were all well fleshed out also, although obviously not quite as well as the characters of Anna and St Clair. Each of them had their own story in the background to Anna's, with their own trials and tribulations. The primary reason I fell head over heels in love with this book was because of its amazing characters.<br />Stephanie Perkin's writing style was well paced. It was not rushed but it was not so slow as to be boring. This was the first book I have ever read front to back with no pauses. And I really mean no pauses! I began this book at eleven o'clock at night and finished by two in the morning. My eyes never left the page once. This is the only book I can say this about. It is simply that engrossing.<br /><br />I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading. It is easily one of my all-time favourite books and I think most people would enjoy it! To be quite honest, this book was so good I would recommend going out and buying it immediately and reading it the second you get home! I really believe you'll love it too!mary reason I fell head over heels in love with this book was because of its amazing characters.<br />Stephanie Perkin's writing style was well paced.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game! I recommend this game to anyone.  Like in the other reviews you don't have to pay for the full game which is awesome.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Its amazing at how a book mainly focusing on one man in a boat can captivate you so much. Once I started reading it I didn't want to put it down. I can't wait to read it again.
B004X6PRO6|1.0|Bougt this book because I currently live in Korea. Thought it might be interesting. I was wrong. The beginning is horribly boring and provides nothing unique. Safe to say, I will be getting my money back!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|fun to play on the pork side and with all the different characters. Play it all the time and try to win
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Just such a great series, if you love a great BBC period piece you will enjoy this. Reminds me of Cranford
B00F35BV64|5.0|I am an old school trekkie, but have really come to like the &#34;new&#34; Star Trek pre-quel series. The characters have maintained the je ne sais quoi that made the originals so fun. Hope they can keep it up.
B00B5DWI2O|5.0|Simply fantastic. Recording quality is a bit on the low side, but it doesn't detract too much from the music composition.
B00CY0JY88|4.0|Easy to read and follow the story line. couln't wait to know what will happen next. i'll recommend this to those who enjoy to read for fun and relaxation, not judge the story on reality...<br /><br />Can't wait for book no. 4!
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|i previously reviewed this movie it is outstanding ..Tom Hanks does and award winning job in this movie .. i say bravo
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm hooked. The characters become part of your life. Can't wait for the season to begin. Upstairs or down their lives are believable. Well written stories and the acting is superb.
B006GGR5QY|5.0|Simply fantastic. Recording quality is a bit on the low side, but it doesn't detract too much from the music composition.
B00498YZH8|5.0|After Hunger Games and Silver Lining I just had to see what this young actress was capable of.  She did not disappoint.  For being so young she has had the maturity to chose scripts that are challenging and unique.  Winter's Bone takes place in the back woods, more poverty stricken that you can imagine. Her life has more burdens than most young wormen could handle. She does not play it as a martyr or with a negative attitude. She plays it as just too busy staying alive to do anything but what she must do. She is one of those stars who has the capability to be working well into her 70s and 80s. I'm praying she does not mess it up by becoming a familiar name in the headlines.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|these guys in this movie are great ...this is one of those movies that i watch over and over again cause the good guys win out in this movie
B00DCRE8TW|5.0|Traditional genre, in a blues,, classic rock vein, but with a musicality all too rare these days and dashes of the unexpected throughout. I typically prefer big, extremely polished production and intricate arrangements/song writing. This album is none of that. The writing/performances are raw, the production is raw, but the delivery is exceptional.  You can hear influences throughout both old and new all wrapped in the unique personality of this bands current lineup. I was in from the first listen and it gets better as we go. Bravo
0802473156|3.0|I bought this book through audible and listened to it at least 3 times. I was happy at the time because this was the last hope for my 14 year relationship and it looked positive. Even my partner listened to it - I thought we were all set. I waited a week or two to see him start speaking my love languages (even just a little) and it didn't happen. All I heard were excuses about how it would take time. This book really has the right message, but it is no guarantee to fix issues when one partner chooses to be ignorant about their role in the relationship.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|A 100 piece orchestra for starters. You will never get that in a live theater performance. Even Andrew Lloyd Webber said this was how he always wanted it to be. Instead of it being an &#34;evil against good&#34;, it was a love triangle. Gerard Butler was a delightful surprise.  Terrific cast, gorgeous costumes and the music ... aaaaah the music.
B0047685I2|5.0|Drew Barrymore does a wonderful job in this movie,,, every woman wants a fairy tale ending and she does a great job in portraying that
B007N8RULO|5.0|I like the fact that you can play four levels of this game.  My favorite is the four suit level, but all levels are a lot of fun.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I was captivated the moment I began to watch. The acting is superb.  Each episode leaves me wanting more. I just love this whole series!
B001GUXJQA|5.0|As the title of this review states, this is one weird, whacky adventure for Detective Harry Bosch. In this book, Harry apparently loses his mind, decides to cross the border into Mexico without authorization, get into fights with giant bulls (!), battle drug lords, and solve the murder of an LA Narcotics Officer while he's at it. It's so outlandish, it sort of reminds me of \\"The Shield\\", yet Connelly delivers it in such fine form, it actually works. I also see an interesting pattern with Connelly's earlier Bosch novels, where the plots were more intricately detailed, and the mysteries more complex (the same was also true for \\"The Black Echo\\" and \\"The Cocrete Blonde\\"). Entertaining throughout, this is a solid crime novel, and I enjoyed reading about some of the earlier days in which Bosch's rocky relationships with Irving and \\"98\\" Pounds were developed. Fast paced, interesting, and engaging, this made for a quick, fun read.
B005NFJAMG|5.0|for some reason i had never seen this movie before.. i bought it because Halley Berry was in it.. .she as well as Kurt Russell did a great job
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I'll read this one over and over again to remain true to the four agreements. Simple, common sense advice but with a spiritual twist.
B0089XH38M|5.0|Does its thing without getting in the way. After months of use, no false positives, no hitches of any kind and no hassle with marketing messages. I use it on Transformer, Droid Razr, Droid X and Nexus 7.
B00AEFYRVO|5.0|This movie has been out long enough now (a little over ten years) where I feel comfortable calling it a classic of modern comedy. What really makes this movie sing is the perfect chemistry that is achieved among the actors. Ferrell, Vaughn, and Wilson are the stars, of course, but everybody in this movie is perfectly cast, contributing in all the right ways, and never detracting from the sum. This is a true TEAM effort- just like the team effort that is required for Old School's unconventional fraternity to succeed! This is \\"low brow\\" comedy, of course, oftentimes bordering on slapstick, so it is intended for those who laugh freely at such juvenile antics. For me, there's something timeless and hilarious about watching these characters stumble about so ineptly, particularly Ferrell's, who is the height of absurdity. I've watched this movie many times, and plan to watch it many more- it still makes me laugh!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book just keeps coming and seems to live with it all: mystery, romance, meaning of life; and manages to be a page turner in the process. I can't believe I hesitated to purchase and read this great American novel.
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|Not many levels. Designed for young boys and men who are Star Wars nerds. Rovio needs to add more to other Angry Birds games now that they have made this one for a limited audience.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great combo of law, romance and suspense. Best TV show out there. Compelling personal stories and personalities. This is thought provoking and entertaining.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Usually I am not attracted to genre but Martin is not a bad writer.  He sneaks up on you.  Instead a big visual spash, he builds the landscape with periodic and intensly visual vignettes.  Just when you think you have the plot mapped he throws a giant monkey wrench which leaves you hanging and inevitably staying up way past your bed time looking for clues.  His story line is sprinkled with anti-heros; they all have feet of clay.  Even the the most attractive characters reveal base and venal tendencies which make you love them more.  A good read.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|You will fall in love with the people and the town in this beautiful well done series. Just loved watching season one, two and three.<br />Cant wait to watch season 4. Dont miss out. Loved it.  !!!!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|The headphones are absolutely great! I love them! I use them mostly every day and I just can't get enough of them. They're the best headphones I've ever had.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Oh my gosh!! What an amazing writer Suzanne is. She gets you hooked into loving characters and then BAM! She throws a wrench in to throw you off. An absolute must read right after you finish the first book.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Read this in 2 days while recovering from surgery.  A pretty compelling, and better than I expected in the beginning.
B0036UMM84|5.0|A must see movie. I couldn't stop watching it. Actors and Actresses were unbelievable. Love the music. I would highly recommend this movie for sure. Will watch it over and over.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I truly enjoyed Amy's style of writing which allowed me to feel I was present during her many interactions with her girls. Interesting that she was seen as a terrible mom by so many when there is so much neglect of children in this country. I was amused,inspired and sad when the book ended.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Where do I begin! This book was fantastic, I'm sure much of this story could be true. The characters are wonderful and each had their own story line. Towards the middle of the book the characters lives and times have intersected. From the 1920's to 2011 this story just drew you in to their lives, the heartfelt love, sad upbringing, hardship and finally a happy ending. Will certainly read more by CB Kline.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I had no Idea that it was for Kindle, until a friend showed me, now I use it all the time.
0345803485|1.0|This is THE worst book that I have ever bought and I am ashamed to admit that yes, I wasted my money on this waste of ink, paper, words and time. Like a stupid idiot I listened to my ditzy, trend obsessed, iphone using best friend when she recommended this book and bought this piece of toilet paper. All I can say is; What were the publishers and editors of E.L James THINKING when they allowed this monstrosity of fiction to go into print? They could have at least corrected some of her frankly juvenile vocabulary laden with awful euphemisms that made me cringe as I read.<br />The number of times Mr Grey 'cocked his head' or Anastasia 'bit her lip' is 102 times too many. It was honestly so bad I had to laugh on occasion, believing it to be a comical situation as it was just too ridiculous. It relied heavily on cliches and stock characters. I can guarantee the people who have given this 5 stars have not read many romance books so do not mind the predictable scenarios, are looking for cheap smut and sex therefore don't notice the terrible grammar, or are simply not very well read and are easily impressed by this 'fad'.<br />My advice to you is PLEASE don't buy this book and prevent the encouragements for writers like E.L James to continue to inflict bad literature onto the world. Don't be the sheep that I was and don't have anything to do with this train wreck.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|DON'T TURN IT ON IF YOUR SHORT ON TIME.  IT'S TO ADDICTING.  I have lost allot of sleep playing this game.
B009G41CG2|5.0|This has always been my favorite and I am so glad I found it for my Kindle.<br />I love the challenge.

B001MSMULG|5.0|The Kill Artist bears all of the hallmarks of a Daniel Silva novel: rich plot lines; detailed locations; interesting characters, and a plot twist . . . or two . . . or three. Good reading!
B00F91H666|3.0|Besides the fact that there are zombies in this movie, it has absolutely nothing to do with the book.  Once you get over the fact that the movie has no relation to the book, it's not bad.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game...I play it everyday..it's different from all the other games I have on my kindle..can't wait to fully build my city..God bless..
B007HWSWQS|5.0|Written in an accessible language. Great strategies to use with children, adolescents and adults. Would  certainly recommend it to my friends and colleagues.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I am on page 185 of 531. BORING. I am sure it gets better..at least I hope so.. but what a wordy long lead-in to a story. Certainly not like the old Stephen King books. Those books I could not put down from the beginning. They held you captive. But this book like so many of his recent ones are popular only because he is the author. We diehard King fans are hoping for another It, another The Shining, another Salem's Lot, a vintage Stephen King book. I was really looking forward to a great Stephen King book. But this is a big disappointment. Certainly not like the Shining. I find myself skimming over paragraphs, something unheard of when I read King's older books.  My advice is wait to buy this. It will be on clearance soon.  Disappointed.
B0011U5E1S|5.0|This is a good album I remember when this group came around and there suscess went over like a wave I like this group it was hard to see Keith gone but he left a lot of good work behind for us to enjoy
B00942Y4IY|4.0|Great movie premise. Holds up well over time including the special effects. There are some goofy things, like the hot alien woman having perfect teeth on her primitive world, but those are easy to overlook.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This book was a fast, fun read. I really enjoyed it. You will love the main character.<br />There are no slow  or dull parts here. I would recommend it.<br /><br />FRANCES GEARY

B000AJIF4E|5.0|Enjoyed having the sound so good when watching a film. It's not noise canceling but it good for me, buy it you will not be sorry.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|It gives an interesting recap of some of the major events leading to and during WWII.  The characters are well developed.
0385751532|5.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas by John Boyne, has a very strong and powerful conflict towards people. The beginning of the book starts with this 9 year old boy named Bruno coming home from school finding the family's maid Maria in his room packing his clothes. He finds out that his family is moving for his father's job. His father works with the Fury and is a commandant. The new house they move to, is called Out-With. From Bruno's window, he can see the back of the house. In the back of the house, there is a forest. One day Bruno takes a walk in the forest, and comes up to a gate. At the gate, he saw a dot in the distance which sooner became a boy. The boy went and sat down cross legged. Bruno introduced himself to the boy. The boy's name was Shmuel. They started talking to each other, and finally Bruno asked Shmuel why there were so many people on that side of the fence and what they were doing there. Everyone there wore stripped pajamas and a cap. Bruno and Shmuel both explain to each other how much they hate their lives, but Bruno doesn't realize what Shmuel goes through on that side of the fence with the concentration camps. The people in the stripped pajamas get tortured everyday by soldiers because they are Jewish. Both boys tried to see each other everyday at the fence. Since Bruno and his family moved to Out-With, nothing has been the same for them. One day Bruno went to swing on their tire swing and fell off. Their waiter Pavel went to go help him because he saw what happened through the kitchen window. Before Pavel became their waiter, he was a doctor and Bruno didn't know that. One day Bruno's sister Gretel heard him say that he had to go meet someone. She wanted to know who he was talking about because she hasn't seen anyone she can play with over there. When she asked him who he was talking about, he said that he had a imaginary friend even though it was Shmuel he was talking about. He didn't want anyone to know that he went to go see Shmuel almost everyday to go talk to him because he would get in a lot of trouble. When he went to go see Shmuel, he tried to bring him bread because he was very skinny and they don't get fed on that side of the fence. Shmuel told Bruno about the story of when him and his family got taken away from their house by the Fury/soldiers because they were Jewish. He told Bruno about how they had to stay in one tiny room with other families. He said that one the boys used to always hit him and he couldn't do anything about it. One night Lieutenant Kotler went to go eat dinner at Bruno's house with his family. Pavel was their waiter that night and Bruno noticed something was different about him that night. He was a older man that got weaker each day. Pavel went to go refill Lieutenant Kotler's glass with wine and he accidently lost grip of the bottle and dropped it on Lieutenant Kotler's lap. He was furious with Pavel and shot him. No one stepped in to stop him. One day Bruno walked into Gretel's room to go see what she was doing. She was playing around with her hair. After a few moments she screamed. Their mother came running up the stairs to see what happened. Gretel found out that she had lice in her hair and so did Bruno. Gretel had to use a special shampoo and Bruno had to get his head shaved. Mother had a talk with father about how she hated it at Out-With and wanted to move back to Berlin. Father talked to Bruno and Gretel about the conversation they had. Bruno and Gretel loved the fact that they a had a chance to move back to Berlin. They had the chance to move back to Berlin with mother or to stay at Out-With, with father. Bruno went to go see Shmuel about what was happening. They both noticed that Bruno looked like Shmuel since he got his haircut. They both wanted to play with each other before Bruno left. They got the idea that the next time they see each other, Shmuel can bring a pair of stripped pajamas and a cap for Bruno. The next day they followed with their plan and Bruno rolled under the hole under the fence. When Bruno noticed how everything was on that side of the fence, it was nothing like he imagined. He saw sad crying people in stripped pajamas and happy laughing soldiers with guns pointing at people. Once Bruno realized that he didn't like it there, he wanted to go home. At that moment there was a whistle blown. Shmuel said that when that happens, a group of people go on a march. Bruno and Shmuel were in that group of people. They started marching in the group and it started raining. The group of people were led into a warm air tight room and got trapped in there. Bruno needed to go home, but couldn't. Bruno told Shmuel that he was his best friend forever and held his hand and didn't let go. After that day, no one heard of Bruno. They all looked everywhere. What they didn't know is that the room they were trapped in was a gas room where they killed people slowly and painfully. Bruno's family prayed everyday that they would hear something about Bruno, but didn't.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Dredd himself is awesome. He's an unapologetic bad ass, whose chin and dry humor makes him even more like able. Other than that it's just like all the other movies of late with their hyper violence.  I gave it 3 stars for the character of Dredd alone, the missing 2 were because of the plot.
B00D7OMNXS|4.0|This movie follows up both on the previous stand alone Iron Man films, and show the &#34;post Avengers&#34; Tony Stark and the toll that the events of that movie had on him. There is a lot of misdirection in this movie, which even hinting about would give away too much. Some people hated the way that turned out, but I personally did not have much problem with it. Although the effect of the big twist did make the movie in a way similar (but not the same) as the plot in the second one.  This film definitely ratchets up the action. There are a lot more &#34;big&#34; action sequences in this movie, from Stark's house being blown up, to a mid air rescue, to the final battle. A lot is going on, and the effects are blended very well with live action shots so they look more &#34;real&#34; than in any of the other movies. The plot is somewhat convoluted and like I said above, has twists to it. Both the characters of Pepper and Rhodes have even more expanded roles in this movie. Robert Downey Jr continues to nail the Tony Stark role and mixes humor and intensity. Ben Kingsly is excellent in his role, he was very chilling as Mandarin, and is involved in one of the plot twists. There is also the usual after the credits scene involving a cameo by one of the Avengers.  As far as extras go, there is about an hour of material from making of/behind the scenes features, a short film that reveals events after the end of Captain America, a short look at the next Thor movie, and a gag reel. In all enough to make those who like the bonus material happy. Of course the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray for those who get the actual discs.  While an argument can be made that the superhero franchises are becoming over saturated, they do not seem to be slowing down over time. This movie definitely left open the possibility of further stand alone Iron Man movies, but also brought a sense of closure to the Tony Stark origin story. If you are a fan of the movies that have come before this one, then you will most likely like this as well.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Excellent purchase, better than expected.the. Wasn't expecting the excellent approach that they took with the remastering.<br />I'm enjoying the old series like it was a preview!<br />The subtle remastering and CGI technique has not ruined the presentation of the Enterprise and crew at all.<br />Really glad they kept the series true to the fans.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Freecell is a favorite of mine. Challenging enough to keep me working at it. I use it as one of my regular brain games.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|You know what you're getting.  This is great instrumental music.  I like Daft Punk as it is, so I couldn't go wrong here.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|This really was a series that was somewhat dangerous to make, because of how iconic Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of the character Hannibal Lector has become, it is hard to imagine anyone else in that role (even though others have played it).  That said Mads Mikkelsen does a great job making the character his own, and while playing it differently than Hopkins, staying true to the character.  For example his portrayal of Lector is somewhat more reserved and less snarky than Hopkins played him.  That is most likely due to the fact that he is still the hidden monster at this point in the story, and still a well respected member of society.  He is still very much the master manipulator however.<br /><br />The TV show is set about 4 years before the events in Red Dragon.  Only the audience knows who Lecter really is (and what he is really serving for dinner), which actually makes watching the events unfold very exciting.  There is always an element of will he be found out that goes on in almost every episode. The series actually revolves as much (if not more so) around the character of Will Graham (played by Hugh Dancy), who is in this version an empathic who can get in the minds of a killer and see how the victims are killed.  Jack Crawford (played by Laurence Fishburne) brings Graham in as a to profile serial killers.  He is shown as very gifted but mentally unstable, and Lecter (who is almost an ancillary character in the first couple episodes) is his psychiatrist and is committing some of the murders being investigated.<br /><br />The series has a lot going for it.  Great acting, writing and special effects are at the top of the list.  The special effects are so good in fact that if you have a weak stomach you may not want to watch after eating because there are some very gory death scenes.  They are as gory as anything you see on a lot of cable shows.  It really is a show that you have to watch from the beginning because there are a lot of story arcs that carry throughout the season.  Some of the episodes have a \\"story of the week\\" flavor to them, but there are a couple story lines that keep coming back over and over.<br /><br />As far as the blu ray set, the series looks and sounds great.  Thankfully it plays in a season mode that allows you to pick up where you left off if you stop it.  There are a lot of special features including extended episodes, commentary on selected episodes, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a few making of/behind the scenes featurettes.  In all there is a lot there for those who like bonus material.  If you are a fan of the books and/or movies, this definitely does them justice and is worth checking out.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I approached this book with trepidation... The Shining was the book that hooked me as a child. I have been a constant reader ever since. So revisiting Danny these many years later made me a little nervous. But Mr. King came through beautifully. I could not set this book down...something I haven't been able to say about his last few books.  Not really scary but there were definitely some uneasy moments. We'll done.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Still my all time favorite movie... The story is pure and a must see for all families to enjoy together.
B009WUBERW|2.0|I liked the actors but, it lacks that continuity that holds your interest through-out the picture and a weak story line. It`s got action & special affects if that's all you want...
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My new phone did not have Kindle preloaded, so the first thing I did was to download the reader.  I mainly use it when I'm traveling because it is so much more convenient than paper books, particularly when weight/size is limited (like camping/hiking/safari).
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Easy movie to watch, some twists to make it interesting, and makes you ponder about what you were seeing after the end.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|My emotions have been completely and totally out of control while reading these last two novels... I'm sad-happy-excited-mad-crying-nervous-confused.... But always left completely wanting MORE!!!! Wow... On to Novel #3!!!!
B000VNMMQG|3.0|The movie was OK - slow and disjointed in places.  The story seemed to wander here and there.  The scenery was great but the story and the plot just weren't very tight.
0451228731|1.0|Reads as though it was written by an adolescent for adolescents and read by adolescents<br />I listened to the audio book and half expected the word \\"dude\\" to be inserted into the dialog at regular intervals.<br />I finished because I paid for it and was driving without anything better to do.
B000GCFG7E|2.0|This novel almost put me to sleep.It was too predictable and too one sided with all the cards with Reacher.Hardly any thing went wrong with his quest for truth about himself and luck was always on his side.Reacher must be made to face serious challenges as otherwise the suspense is gone and the story becomes too simplistic.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Just like going online, i would still go on like, online youtube is faster, it downloads faster than this, but its good to
B000PKX2KA|1.0|apparently is good, but it's badly designed and that you disconnect the laptop and simply stopped working, it is detected by the pc but does not work or send data, also the company never answers or opinions of how to solve the problem
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is fun! not so keen though on having to buy money. but all in all a very well done game.

B00499NHLC|5.0|I'm a huge Sherlock Holmes fan and have read all the Doyle books many times.  This is the best modern/re-interpretation I've ever seen and Cumberbatch is the very best Sherlock Holmes I've ever seen.  Basil Rathbone set a standard back in the 30s and 40s but he was no more accurate than this interpretation.  This Sherlock is as inventive and clever as the original, sometimes more surprising, and also has faults as the original did.  Cumberbatch is the kind of actor who comes along once a generation.  There are very few of these kinds of actors and he's got the potential to supersede all of today's stars.  He's better than Tom Hanks, better than Philip Seymour Hoffman, better than Denzel Washington (who also began his career with promise).  I am also a Star Trek fan and he also blew me away as a re-interpreted Khan.  OMG he made Ricardo Montelban look like a paper villain.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Very use full to read and edit word papaers from device.I think is necessary for every kindle. I can work everywhere and fast.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Great Book, Have read many of the books of Jack Reacher / Lee Child enjoyed them all! Strongly Recommend them!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Just like your normal Google, or any other search engine, i would recomend justo going online insted of downloding this app
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|After listening to this new cd a bunch of times I think I lump it in the middle of the pack.  I like it more than Train of Thought and Black Clouds/Silver Linings but I enjoyed Dramatic Turn of Events and Octavarium much more.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in the mix as I feel the guitars are a bit too loud and overpower the vocals at times.  I do enjoy the songs but it lacks the drama of the last album which in my opinion was one of their best ever.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Too much chatter, not enough real story, jumps back and forth too much, never really goes anywhere, very disappointing end.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Stephen King who wrote 'Doctor Sleep' is not the same man who wrote 'The Shining'.  Late nights, long miles, and life has left its mark.  He's an experienced writer, he's refined his craft, and it's no longer the terror that scares you or horror that grosses you, but a sharp tug at the heart strings that accompanies the real loss of a loved one or trying to atone for our sins<br /><br />'Doctor Sleep' is a much different story than 'The Shining', but it's a warm, comfortable, and loving return home from a man whose been to hell and back.  While the story might not be so loved by fans who came to appreciate the alcoholic King, the scare-Meister King, or the loving-drama King, it's a welcome return home to the Constant Reader who grew up with Stephen King and who has been through it all with him.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is a great game.Very good graphics,especially when you slice off a head.Everyone should buy this game.Hope you will like it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I watched the entire season too fast. But, excellent show! Plot and characters develop well, though quite unbelievable. Love It!
B00AYE8C70|1.0|I down load the apps. It did not work for me for some reason. I had to uninstall it again...
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I w a s hoping that this would shine more light on t he finish of this story instead I am left feeling at loose ends . Hope the next instead  lament doesn't take y ears in the completion. Understand a novel of this magnitude can't be written over knight,but after airing so long for this on thinking it was the end,  ell so m what left empty.

B0064MGU98|5.0|This is an amazingly good show.  Writing and acting are both outstanding.  Love the character development.  It is great to be able to watch one episode right after the other without having to wait a week.  Makes me glad I didn't watch on regular TV from the beginning.<br />I'm hooked.
B00F5I344G|5.0|Warren Haynes is a great guitarist. What an interesting concept using guest artists on the second disc.Hope we don't have to wait so long for his next disc.

B00E687MWQ|2.0|the music was uncreative and unpoetic i couldnt make it through 2 tracks of this nonsense, making it in a mix of languages and putting it in a fast beat does not make it as good as burzum, its just talentless

B0000025IE|5.0|Good cd like NEW! Love it and good fast shipping! No scratches on disk or case. Love it will listen t it more often!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think this game is great it challenges you based on you  age, I just turned twelve and it got harder on my birthday.<br />Unfortunately if you want to get the new setting would have to unlock it or pay.<br />Honestly this game is almost perfect
B004VMVTNU|4.0|Great alarm app. Works far better than the stock alarm that comes with android phones. However, there needs to be a way to do bulk deletion of alarms. Also, if you use Google now to set a timer, it sets an alarm in this app instead of the timer.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Hi<br /><br />I am giving it a 4 star primarily to provide attention though it is a beatiful matt/frosted unit, that the battery do not have a on/off button.<br /><br />It switches on when you pull out the supplied mirco cable/adaptor and switches off when you put the cable/adaptor back in. Same goes for the inserting extenal calble to it's USB port.<br /><br />NB: As a 6000mAH, it should at least provide 3 x fully charge for iPhone 5 or Nokia 1020. I will provide further updates if it does not.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I never saw a single episode of this series when it was &#34;new.&#34;  I thought it would be pretty hokie and gushy, with Sarah Connor crying all the time about her unfortunate, doomed son...so I just ignored the whole series.  When it wasn't on that long, I figured the market place agreed with me!<br /><br />i was WRONG.  Period.<br /><br />Turns out this is a great series.  Yeah, there's a &#34;mom's perspective&#34; integrated throughout the show...but hey, we're talking about SARAH CONNOR here.  Turns out she does more than just whine and emote about her ill-fated son.<br /><br />Oh, she does plenty of emoting.  But the driver of this show is the action, and giving us glimpses of the world(s) in which John Connor developed helps flesh out the genre quite nicely.<br /><br />They've got a great cast, too.  Many, MANY great actors playing what may turn out to be &#34;the role of their lives!&#34;<br /><br />This is a watcher, for sure.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I Love that u can put the Holy bible on ur phone and on ur tablets and no that u have ur bible with u always, that is very awesome. Kudos 2 whomever thought of this ideal.
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|The Tedeschi Trucks Band produce consistently good music.  This disk is as good as their previous releases.  Ms. Tedeschi's vocals are good and her vocal range is pretty good.  The guitar playing is superb, and the rest of the band blend well and carry the rhythm along very well.  The new songs are interesting, except some of the lyrics are very repetitious.  All in all a good disk.
630529142X|1.0|I'm a big fan of this goofy, fun movie, but not this DVD. I've owned it for 10+ years, and had not re-watched it again for at least 8-9 years.  Last time was on a CRT (old tube TV). I played it the other night on my plasma TV, and lo and behold, it's not anamorphic!  What the.....!!  Big thumbs down.<br /><br />If you are not sure what I'm saying, this movie is in 1.85:1 ratio which should fill the entire screen on a HDTV, but instead it fits inside a 4x3 (old TV) ratio.  In other words, the movie is widescreen but fits inside this squarish picture with bars on both the left and right.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I loved every second of this movie. The story, if not fantastical, was cute. Mr. Fredrickson and Russel are a hilarious duo, and I was thrilled! Great movie!
B0014DW3OS|4.0|Overall, a well done movie, with a truly out of character role played by Denzel Washington.  While watching the film, I kept thinking that Samuel Jackson should have gotten this role. But Denzel adds a level of professionalism and class to this role of an out of control LA Police vice detective that Jackson likely could likely not have pulled off.  You know, from Jackson's previous roles in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, that Jackson plays a \\"bad guy\\" very well, and without a doubt.  Washington, on the other hand, is far more stealthy regarding character judgement.  The movie Flight is a good example of this.  He starts out as this wonderful \\"hero pilot\\", and ends up as a model prisoner, all because of his own bad behavior,.  This bad behavior sneaks up on the viewer, and is certainly not \\"in your face\\" the way Jackson has played his roles.  As Training Day gets going, one does not know what to make of Washington's character, and neither does his newly hired police partner.  One wonders if the experienced detective (with 15,000 convictions) is going to be a positive role model for the newbie police officer, or is he actually a corrupt demon, which he clearly becomes by the end of the film.  A very good film, that I don't particularly want to see again.  It can be frightening to the viewer to see the subtle ambiguities that separate right from wrong.  Washington again demonstrates his superior skills in this regard on the big screen.  His acting abilities right now reminds me of a young Robert DeNiro.  This film reminds me of Taxi Driver.  In both films, the main character travels between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" with stealth and subtlety, and there are not many actors who can pull this off.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I really enjoyed the straightforward, logical and easy to understand ideas presented in this book.<br />I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their lives and would like simple, practical  steps to a happier , more fulfilling life!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is super fun and addictive. Beginning levels start easy and get harder and more fun as u go.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|OMG, even though I'm 16, I thought this was cute. All 3 of the movies are wonderfully humorous, enchantingly endearing, and it displays friendship, loyalty, and love. Love 'em all!
0143124544|2.0|To all the other reviews on this book, I felt I had to add my own because I disagree with the majority.  I bought this book against my better judgment because it was recommended so enthusiastically by one of the book store staff.  I was put off by the flowery script on the cover and by the description; I thought I knew exactly where the book would go.  The bookstore clerk assured me it wasn't what I thought.  After reading the Amazon recommendation and seeing the ratings from readers, I decided to give it a chance.  I should have trusted my instincts.  This book was EXACTLY what I thought it was.  For heaven's sake, the blurb on the paperback completely gives away the ending!  I concur with those who describe this book as a Lifetime movie or a Harlequin romance.  Shallow and completely predictable.  I really can't account for the highly positive reviews.  I can only surmise that most of the people who rated it so high, read a lot of books that are worse than this.  This book is the literary equivalent of Appleby's.  You can convince yourself that you are going out to dinner, but it is really just fast food disguised as a sit down meal.  I'm most surprised by the \\"Best Books of the Month\\" recommendation from Amazon.  Challenge yourself every once in a while...rent the movie Gattica.  It has the same type of theme, but instead of being the main story, it is just one dimension of a more complex sci-fi story.  Or read \\"Never Let Me Go\\" by Kazuo Ishiguro for an example of truly accomplished writing and moral, emotional complexity (that gets only a four-star average from readers on Amazon).
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I enjoyed reading about the involvement of the French in the Nazi Occupation.  Very clever way to include what occurred to the families.  It was horrific and I cried as I read about it.
B00849F82E|5.0|Theological truths can be lost if they are taught in the classroom or not made accessible to everyday people like you and I. Chesterton does a great job of moving theological truths from the classroom into the realm where we can access it and integrate it into our daily lives.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|OMG, even though I'm 16, I thought this was cute. All 3 of the movies are wonderfully humorous, enchantingly endearing, and it displays friendship, loyalty, and love. Love 'em all!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I really enjoyed Season 1 of The Good Wife.  The characters do a great job showing their emotional conflicts--Alicia, with her husband, Will and Cary the other junior associate; the kids deciding to investigate the blackmail photos on their own.  I love the relationship complexities that are developed in this initial season.
044024613X|4.0|This was recommended to me by my dental assistant and I enjoyed it. It kept me reading and I was not bored. As the mother of three boys it kept me thinking and wondering, what would I do?  It's a good read.
B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|It's witty. It's semi interesting. But it's slow and predictable. But it's Marvel. The fanatics among us are going to like it way more than it deserves.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|What's there to say? Dory, Marlin, Nemo, Crush, and the other fishy friends are wonderfully created. I think Crush and Dory are my favorite characters. Highly recommended.
B00CTMA95S|4.0|Fast paced, fun to read and lots of interesting subjects.<br />What you'd expect from a Sigma Force novel.<br />Already waiting for the next one.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I received this Verso case on Christmas of 2011. It is now September of 2013 and the case is still in excellent condition. Anyone who says the straps don't fit a Kindle Fire simply doesn't understand the design! There are four elastic straps. Each strap has a plastic strip on the back that holds the Kindle in place. It is VERY secure. I've never had an issue with the Kindle falling out or even becoming loose.<br /><br />The design is meant to look like a book--you can open and close it easily and there is no elastic strap, magnet or velcro to secure it down. If you're always putting your Kindle into a bookbag, a purse, or somewhere it might be in contact with dirt and debris, this one might not be for you. The ports are left exposed and since there isn't a strap to hold the cover down, I can see how the screen might get scratched if you aren't careful. I haven't had an issue as I have a purse with a designated compartment for my Kindle. Also, I usually just use it at home.<br /><br />I LOVE this case and I'm happy to have it! The only thing I'd add would be a place to hold a stylus. It is exactly what I need in a case.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|\\"The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it, no paper notices on downtown posts and billboards, no mentions or advertisements in local newspapers. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.\\"<br /><br />I have to say, the way I feel about Moulin Rouge is exactly how I feel about The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern. You know in the first 30 minutes of the movie, you think \\"I think this is going to be great, but what is going on right now?\\" and then suddenly you can't stop watching/reading. The sights, the descriptions, the story.....all so fascinating that before you know it, you're completely drawn into the beautiful world of the circus and the love story. What's The Night Circus all about?<br /><br />The book moves along slowly, but in a good way, with each page drawing you deeper into the story. The plot thickens, gets more intense and then when you finally turn that last page, you want to go back and reread it.<br /><br />Morgenstern's descriptions of the various tents and the circus are fascinating and lovely. There's characters you despise and characters you love. Darkness battling goodness, beauty and a love story you root for from the beginning all make up this fantastic debut novel!<br /><br />Now if the circus were really like this, I'd be there every night.<br /><br />For those of you who read it, what did you think of the very last section? And what did you think of the ending??<br /><br />Also, can someone create the dresses from the novel and give them to me? Thanks! I'd appreciate it.<br /><br />\\"The finest of pleasures are always the unexpected ones.\\"
B003QTSMXE|4.0|I loved the movie, and thought it was a good wake-up call for people today, as it portrayed the irony of how tech-crazed society is today. But in general, there wasn't much talking, except more towards the end from the people on the space ship, and an occasional 'computerized' noised from Wall-e and Eva (the main characters). But I thought it was cute, anyway. I'm easy to please when it comes to PIXAR ;)
B008PZZV8S|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in a theater. Read the book but thought the movie did a better job showing how creepy Tom Ripley is and unlike a Tony Soprano, who you come to love and root for - did not find Tom to be sympathetic at all. Good movie for an afternoon in with a warm fire.
0143039431|4.0|Literary classic. If you haven't read this book I suggest you do. You'll not regret it! I almost guarantee it.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love the minions! game is fun and keeps getting better! myself and my 2 and 4 year old play. very cool game.
B0053ZOQMK|1.0|Personally, I thought it was very dry. It is a cartoon and funny in parts, but it is not a Johnny Depp film. I did not even finish it all the way through.
1423124111|5.0|Beautiful poster art! Great for artists or hard core Disney fans. Posters fill up the entire page and print is crisp in full color.

B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is a fast paced, intelligent, entertaining drama/comedy.  The acting is superb regardless of the character.  The language and themes of each episode are realistic and thought provoking.  I'm happy I found it on Amazon Prime so I can enjoy a program I failed to watch when first aired.
145211207X|5.0|Book is full of colorful images, sketches and art from the film. It is a great resource for artists or fans alike.
B001EBWING|4.0|I've known of this movie all my life and finally got a chance to view it in private. the end.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|What a GREAT season, from the ending of S2 all the way through S3 is Star Trek at it's best.  This is the hall-of-fame season that holds it's own against any season of any other franchise series or movie.  Don't get my wrong, I love Voyager, Deep Space Nine and the series that really spoke to me... Next Generation.  But since they are all so good it's sometimes difficult to identify the truly exceptional.  I can confidently tell you that Enterprise S3 is the f-#@&% BOMB!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great acting, strong characters with good story lines.  Courtroom drama, underhanded politics, and discrete relationship issues,  throw in..some teens and a moter-in-law.  Best of all on prime i can watch mutipule episodes, without commerials.  Or catch one as my scedule permits.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is fun when you are board on a bad day. I like that you can go against other people. I also like how you can design the background and cards.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I don't even own a television, and have not for about 13 years, so watching the &#34;boob-tube&#34; is not a priority for me.  In fact, most of what I watch is online, or on DVD (I'm a huge film buff).  Yet, Broadchurch is the only show that I actually have paid to watch as soon as a new episode emerged.  The acting is so impeccable, you forget that David Tennant, Olivia Coleman, Pauline Quirke, Jodie Whittaker, David Bradley, Andrew Buchan, Matthew Gravelle, Arthur Darville, Joe Sims, and their co-stars (I honestly could go on--and I don't want to go without mentioning the young actors in the midst of the plot, who are engaging in their own ways) are acting.  While it is an &#34;ensemble cast,&#34; each character's backstory (especially what you do not know) will hook you from the get-go.  Tennant and Coleman in particular dazzle in this series--they are rough, emotional, detached, cool, hot-headed, and HUMAN, depending on the situation.<br />This show may have the classic &#34;whodunnit?&#34; genre stamped upon it in some way, but it's thoroughly original, gripping, emotional, and devoted to maintaining suspense from start to finish.  Those who enjoy AMC's The Killing (or who know of the American show) may feel compelled to make parallels, but aside from the basic outline of the story, the two programs have different vibes and heft to them.  It is Broadchurch that made me feel simultaneously attracted to and repelled by every character at some point.  It is Broadchurch that had me refusing to blink, lest I miss a clue, and it is Broadchurch that had me up late each night after every episode, mulling over what I had just seen with as much intensity as DI Hardy and DS Miller.<br /><br />Particularly refreshing about Broadchurch is that it seldom uses &#34;bells and whistles.&#34;  This is not a generic, gaudy, fast-paced and high-octane romp through a murder-mystery.  It is a show with a sneaky pacing, one that reflects the haunting and, thus, lingering suspicions that slowly-yet-surely fall atop every resident in Broadchurch.<br /><br />I'd highly-recommend this show to anyone who loves thrillers, mystery, suspense, BBC productions, and hefty heart-tugging drama.  You will not be disappointed.

B009LK6JS2|1.0|I hate this game when ever I start I just die.fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I would defintly recomend this game other than that.<br />I would also recomend there other game air navy fighters
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so fun and addictive I played it for 2hours and I didn't realize it.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to pass the time
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Yes, the story could have been better developed but these 'new' Star Trek movies are obviously meant to be action flicks, not ethical dissertations.  Given that, I really liked Into Darkness.  Especially the design, aesthetics and cinematography.  This movie just looks good.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars not 5 b/c the story didn't blow my mind so the movie could have been better, but it was still pretty good and had some fun surprises (without giving too much away, I liked that the story was a weird/warped version of another famous Star Trek plot that unfolded differently in the new, alternate timeline).<br /><br />I initially questioned the choice of the alternate timeline setting for these new movies since so much remains in the original universe, e.g. the period between Enterprise and TOS or TOS and TNG, but I see now that it's mainly a vehicle to allow for re-imagining the star trek universe including the characters and races, which if done creatively which I believe so far it has been, is in fact a very good thing.  I really want to see more of the 'new' Klingons!  Also, I'm not sure if it was in the last movie, but I love the way the warp drive is re-imagined, much more realistic, it looks like a particle accelerator meets National Ignition Facility.<br /><br />If you like Star Trek, action movies or sci-fi, not to mention all three, this is a movie for you!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The Good Wife is one of the best shows ever. All four seasons are great.<br />I recommend this show to all except children. If this is your first time watching,<br />start with: Season 1, Episode 1.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|8 episodes and done!  Awesome acting in a perfect murder mystery.  OMG moments throughout.  Couldn't wait to watch the next episode each time.

B003XVYLDU|4.0|Heartwrenching AND witty, shocking YET life-affirming, deeply cynical BUT strangly hopeful. A book that needs to be reread every few years. Vintage Vonnegut.
B00BTM29LQ|5.0|This is my favorite book of all times.  Nisargadatta's words open us up to the truth of who we are.  His words are transformational.  Leave yourself behind and enter.
B00F91H666|3.0|It was a good movie in my opinion. I would recommend this movie. Makes you think that something like this could really happen.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|My husband and I are Star Trek fans since the original TV series and loved the remake of Star Trek.  The actors they chose and the way the characters were played were dead on!  This movie takes things one step further and we love it!  I hope they continue to make more Star Treks.  Star Trek Into Darkness is great fun for all and the Blu-ray is amazing!  Can't say enough good things about it.  I don't think any Star Trek fan will be disappointed with this movie and if you aren't a big fan of Star Trek you should still see this movie. It has good FX, good story, and a lot of action and a lot of insight into the characters that I didn't expect but loved.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I love all things Gosling but The Notebook is just about my favorite.  I've seen it many times and should probably own it.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Dream Theater was always a 'let the music do the talking' type of band and this new album is no exception. The 'intro' to the album was just amazing, I was kinna expecting maybe a page out of Metallica's book but I was very pleased what I did hear. The writing was spot on as usual, from the disasters in life after life changing events (PTSD)to everyday life's wants and desires. Now I'm going to say something that surprise some of us fans of the band. The songs are too short. What got me into this band way back in 1992 was the instrumental breaks and jams from 'Metropolis 1' or 'Learning To Live'. I love the 10, 15 or 20+ minute sagas that told the story both musically and lyrically. Dont get me wrong, the songs here are fantastic and well written but the jams are missing. Missing from the jams are the pieces from Petrucci and Rudess, the killer bass lines from Myung, and the great drum fills. IMO Mangini is a great piece of work in his own and on this album, he's very precise and not afraid of the odd time signatures the band is often known for. This album gets 5 stars based on the excellent writing, James LaBrie's best vocal performance since 'A Change Of Seasons', Mangini's 'coming out' party.... dude played his arse off!! Myung's excellent sound, Rudess' amazing consistency and finally Petrucci's constant creativity on guitar. Buy this album and give it a listen or 2. It will grow on ya.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|I was not sure what to expect from this because, like a lot of other DT fans, I didn't know too much about Richie Kotzen.  Well, let me tell you, this guy is the real deal.  The album has a hard-rock, blues-based feel, in the vain of classic Zeppelin.<br /><br />Portnoy's playing is superb.  Apparently, he has a great chemistry with Billy Sheehan so I hope the band has lots of success. I would highly recommend.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I needed an alarm to wake me while travelling. This did the trick. I like the choice of waking sounds and the fact that you can set the alarm to repeat on other days. A good deal.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I can not tell you how much I love these books. They are amazing and I of the things I love most about them is after reading when you go online other people have noticed things that I hadn't for example Patchface's prophecies. These books are a lot better than the HBO series and dare I say it better than The Lord of the Rings. I haven't met anyone who hasn't read these books and not loved them. To be honest Dany's story gets a bit boring but then picks up in the last chapter of ADWD. Please buy these books and have your life changed for the better
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game. I like the fact that you can't win all the games. I find it more challenging this way. I like this app so much I have it on my android phone and both Kindles. My husband and I compete. We like to show each other the dancing cards when you win. Great game.
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|this is a first rate effort.  This album has all the elements that DT fans expect:  the heaviness, the complexity and the progressive elements.  I've read many of the previous reviews and they seem to focus on minor issues.  For example, one reviewer noted that &#34;The Looking Glass&#34; sounded too much like Rush.  I'm not sure what is bad about that.  The Looking Glass has a heavy, (in a major progression), uplifting riff from Petrucci and standout vocals from Labrie. &#34;Surrender to Reason&#34; is another example of Labrie in top form.<br /><br />The drum production is another aspect worth noting.  On Dramatic Turn of Events, I enjoyed Mangini's playing and his snare sound as well. On &#34;Dream Theater&#34;, the mixing appears to give Mangini's drums more life.  He provides some tasty fills and his snare sound on this album has a louder, more assertive sound.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned as a downside the compression used by John Petrucci in the production of this album.  Well, I compared the production from Count of Tuscany to the production of this album and that reviewer may have a point. But the compression certainly does not take away from the quality of the production on &#34;Dream Theater&#34;.<br /><br />Lastly, I love the sound of Myung's bass on this record.  For me, it seemed like his bass sound had been phased out (to some degree) on the several albums prior to Portnoy leaving the band.  On this record, just like on Dramatic Turn of Events, Myung has more presence and he sounds great.<br /><br /> Enjoy!
B006IYG5HE|3.0|I've started this series on the recommendation of several friends. This book took its time getting started. I was a little 'cold' on all the WWII stuff. That said, the story was enough that I'll continue on with the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers is a reeally good game for kids and adults too. I know my kid loves it and playes it all the time. Really. ALL THE THE TIME!

B004YCKK6Y|5.0|Unique, abstract, and full of surprises! The cast of characters will shock and dismay while smiling at the different plots.
B000000WFZ|5.0|The Mission still competes with any of the best movie soundtracks. It is the eloquence of the solitary oboe and the counter voice of the indian flute that dramatize an eternal struggle of evil and innocence. The drums accelerate as the cataclysm approaches and before silence a single incredible indian voice sings of the innocence that dies and disappears.  This is what I hear when I listen to the soundtrack. Over and over again.

B002ZG976U|5.0|I don't know if vintage burlesque was ever this good but Burlesque is tops! Excellent stage numbers and staging, engaging plot and satisfying conclusion. Christina's acting skills shine. Watch this movie just to hear her sing if nothing else.  What a voice!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Fantastic book that doesn't seen quite as engaging when you first start reading. It appears to be about the normal pleasures and doubts of day to day life and relationships. As you keep reading, it takes some interesting turns while trying to demonstrate the ripples that our decisions can have in our life. The author also does some interesting &#34;what-if&#34; vignettes in a couple of places. Very well worth the read!
0143119680|5.0|This book was in good condition and it was a little more interesting then the second book but it still took me a couple of months to read
B00F35B8F8|2.0|The best I can say is that the visual effects were stunning but they relied too much on that. I have watched all the Star Trek series and have seen all the movies starting with the original series back in the sixties so I feel I can make a valid comparison. The best I can say is that the current individuals in charge of doing Star Trek have lost the vision in both this movie and it's predecessor. The best they could do was a couple of cheap knock offs of the original series and then they changed the story lines in illogical ways.<br /><br />All I can say to the current producers and directors is that Star Trek is not a video game. Come on guys, you can do better!
B004LROUNG|2.0|Actually I did not finish the book.  It just got bogged down in two much lawyer stuff so I gave up on it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|After reading the first two in the series, I'm fast becoming a Jack Reacher fan.  I'm almost through with the third one, now.  I was originally attracted to the books because of Lee Child's commentary in John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee novels.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Karl Urban is awesome as Dredd.<br /><br />Great storyline.<br />Great acting.<br />Excellent visuals.<br /><br />I hope they make a sequel to this!

B0036S4B6M|5.0|I read the book after I watched the series on Netflx.  I loved the series and l was interested in reading the book to see how much of the series was based on the book and how much was fluffed up.  As thought, many of the characters were enhanced for the series, the book was great.  A fun read.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I am Still looking for the humor of boston legal but I am becoming interested.watched first 3 so far. I
B001AQQR2S|2.0|Not quite what I remembered.  It is rated PG but I still expected it to be okay for my Y7 crowd.  Not so - it's a little too violent and pointless.  There are no life lessons to be learned with this one, and no entertainment value for the kids.  I was hoping for a little more and got a little less.
B003VW54QO|5.0|If you like westerns, law and order stories, and a comeback story, Rio Bravo is a great film.  John Wayne is the king of western actors.  He plays a courageous, tough, but compassionate sherriff

B00F35B8F8|5.0|Awesome! Great sequal! Storyline was very well done. I woild recommend this movie to anybody who is a star trek fan!
B001BC5HXG|5.0|This book is simply amazing, beautifully explores the topic of good and evil.<br />The story was so captivating that I finished this 600 page book in just a couple of days. There's so much depth to this book, and so many passages to make you thing and ponder over.<br /><br />Critics of the book had a disbelief in the character Cathy. Characters in the book are meant to be symbolic of good, evil, and in-between. The book in itself was a bit mythical, but there was nothing in the book that was unbelievable, including Cathy.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to everyone, it's definitely one of my favorites.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is a super fun and enjoyable app for all ages even my mom likes this. Thank you to whoever created this app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is challenging but so fun my sister and I always play with each other it is the best game ever played!!!!!!!!!!!!,-,,
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I'm new at this game but love it so far. My son introduce it to me. He loves it and says it is so addictive.
0142422010|4.0|I would definitely recommend this book.<br /><br />I found &#34;Lola&#34;'s eccentricities entertaining and endearing instead of annoying.  Her self-doubt, confusion, and inner dialog felt realistic because, really, how many people never internally second-guess their decisions, feelings, thoughts, etc....?  The character development of Lola, Max & Cricket kept my interest.  The author wrote in a way that had me torn between wanting her to choose Max and Cricket the way Lola was and as Lola's feelings for those characters evolved, so did mine.  And that says something, I think.<br /><br />It wasn't soul defining.  It wasn't earth shattering.  It was a story about relationships through a 17-year-old's eyes.  It made me feel like they were real people living in the world, with real, regular everyday problems with life, growing up and figuring out how to do that and what that means.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|I think I did it backwards. First I saw this movie, then read reviews claiming that the original foreign version was better so I borrowed that one from the library. Then I read the book.<br /><br />Let Me In conceals the fact that Abby is actually a boy who was castrated. It hints at it with lines like &#34;What if I'm not a boy&#34; but never explains what that means. I took it to mean that she was a vampire and not  human. The book removes all doubt with an explanation of how and when the sex  change happened..<br />Then there is her companion. Let Me In leads the viewer to think that she teamed up with him when he was a boy and will be replaced by her new friend, Owen. Looking ahead, the viewer expects that Owen will also be replaced eventually. The book clearly shows that this is not the case at all. The man is a monster!  That said, I prefer Let Me In to the original foreign film, Let the Right One In and also prefer it to the book which provides details omitted in the movie. This is one of the very few movies I have seen in which I would not have changed a thing.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|It's a pretty good app, but when you're trying to look at someone's picture it loads pretty slow. Other than that  It's pretty good.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|If you need an extra alarm, look no further. This little app is very useful and has great features. For example you can customize your alarm sound. Great value for $1,20.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Plague is a great game for those who are a bit morbid. It teaches while it entertains. Buy this game and kill the world!
B009JZSC9S|4.0|The Good Wife is one of the best shows on TV - ever. The cast is outstanding and the story lines are great. It keeps me riveted show after show. My only complaint is the character of Alicia's brother. I don't see that it adds anything to the show. And, no, I am not homophobic. I just don't like the character and think it would be a better show without him. He is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a addicting game for all ages. If u buy it u will love it no doubt.Now I have something to do to wast some time.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|this is another show that ended before its time, it had many directions that the story line could go and keep its ratings
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is such a great series, as I tell my friends it is kind of like a British version of Little house on the prairie. The acting is superb and you get caught up in the characters and their lives.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|...was canceling this show! Firefly was one of the best SF shows ever made. This is true character oriented science fiction. Unlike the space opera shows like Star Trek next generation, this show doesn't get wrapped up in fake science like graviton fields, etc. Firefly uses it's science fiction canvas to do what science-fiction was intended to do, to examine human interactions in a different environment to show how they are in real life. This show was only allowed to run one season. But it ends on an episode that forms a reasonable ending so you won't feel too much like reading a book with the last shatter torn out. However, I do suggest that you follow watching this series by watching the movie &#34;Serenity&#34;. Serenity was created to give the fans a true ending.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|2 stars out of 5 because after only one month's use of this device it is starting to fail. One side of my headphones (sennheiser hd 598) only works with the amp and I have to shake a bit to work again on both sides. It is doing this more frequently with each day passed.<br /><br />It might be the world class inc seller that is selling sub par or cheap chinese knockoff because these things are known to be somewhat durable and 1 month of it already screwing up is ridiculous. I am returning this item and luckily I have around 5 more days to do so.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you buy these there will be huge risk of them failing after a month or so. I do not recommend purchasing from these people. Find a more durable amp if you are looking for one and don't forgo durability just for portability; that was my mistake.

B000OJFV4C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this incredible journey in England's history. Quite graphic but made it more intriguing through out the 4 seasons!
B0084TWN9K|4.0|Exquisitely crafted and written stories, often deceptively simple in their origins.  No one does it better than Alice Munro for short stories.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive and fun. It was a great idea to get this app. You`'ll love having and playing it.
B00F4PVFE6|3.0|I am a fan of both lead actors and was so excited by the first few episodes. Without giving any spoilers, in the final episode you learn who the killer is and it is the most random gobbledegook I have ever seen.<br /><br />What makes whodunits compelling is for the audience to be able to suss out the killer or at least who had the most probable cause by watching each new episode. Don't bother trying to figure this one out. The killer in the end had next to no link to Danny and there is no story thru out the episodes that link them in anyway.<br /><br />The only foreshadowing I can see after watching the series is one statement from one character in one episode.<br /><br />So if the point of the writer and director was to surprise the audience at the end, well done, I was surprised. But you might as well made the killer Homie the Clown because there was absolutely no tie in.<br /><br />Loved David Tennant tho!
B007AL48UK|4.0|original graphics. makes for a unique experience playing a time honored game. really enjoy this. has crashed occasionally but small price for lots of fun.

B0014BY72Q|4.0|The special effects may be more than a little dated, but the film is a classic. Very innovative when released for both style and content. Worth seeing.

B00B2JSRAS|2.0|If I had realized it was so similar to &#34;The Secret&#34; I would not have bought it. I don't even like &#34;The Secret.&#34; The law of attraction has been around in one form or another for decades; this is just a fancied-up repackaging for the New Age market.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. You get the best of both worlds...Bingo and Slots. The only thing that I don't like is multiples of inventory items. I feel that once you have earned it, the game should move on to something else that you need. It makes it hard to get ahead at times. However, I totally enjoy the game.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book will be very uncomfortable for those with unquestioning faith in the Bible  (and particularly the New  Testament) as the &#34;Word of God&#34;.  Time and again it shows, with scholarly documentation, the difficulties and traps of a literal interpretation of the Scriptures.  And it shows-- in the context of the times-- That Jesus  was one of many self-proclaimed messiahs (anointed ones) who traced his lineage to King David, was one among many who rebelled against the manner in which the Temple Priesthood had warped the Law and the Jewish traditions, one among many who preached salvation outside the Jewish autocracy, one among many to practice miracles (&#34;magic&#34;  as perceived by peoples at that time), and one among many thousands who were crucified by the Romans for being too &#34;zealous&#34; in pursuit of their religious or political beliefs.  So why was this itinerant carpenter from Nazareth singled out to become the divine symbol of the largest modern religion?  Read the book and find out Aslan's thought-provoking explanations.  This is not an atheistic tome nor is it anti-religious.  But it does force the serious reader to question the mystical and mythical aura which has been built up around Jesus-- who was undoubtedly a very charismatic individual with a powerful message that resonates today-- but who was, in the end, most likely a VERY human being.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|There are not enough words for how amazing this book is. Seriously. I finished it and I cannot get it out of my head. It is so heartbreaking and beautiful and just amazing. From the first sentence I was hooked. I wanted to know more, wanted to know Eleanor and Park and everything that would happen. This was one of those books when I was devastated when it was over. One of those books that just sucks you in so far when you finally get to the end you just can't believe it is over. I remember looking and seeing I only had 20 pages left and just being in denial. It cannot be over, I never wanted it to end. I could have continued reading this story until both characters grew old and died. I want more. It was incredible. I almost cried when I got to the last page. Amazing.<br /><br />So let's see if I can put into words everything that was amazing about this story. The writing. The writing was so good and so real and it just put you right there. You were feeling everything along with the characters. Who knew you could describe a simple act of holding hands for the first time in such a way. It was unbelievable and felt like it was the most intimate moment a person could share, and it was just holding hands. It was mind boggling how the author could describe such simple things in such beautiful ways. The way everything was described and unfolded was just amazing. The situations were not always happy or nice or pleasant. but I still couldn't help but want more. I just can't get over it. Beautiful beautiful story. The writing was amazing.<br /><br />The characters. I loved both of them so much. I love that they bonded over comic books. I love that they were so secretive and figuring out how to be together without letting anyone else destroy it. Park was so nice, and so sweet and just amazing. Eleanor had more issues and wasn't sunshine and rainbows but it still worked. Park worked. I wish my first boyfriend would have been half of what Park was. Or a quarter of Park. He was just so good for her, and her for him.<br /><br />Just go read this book. Seriously. Do it now. I am still heartbroken that it is over. I still want more. I feel like I need to go re-read it right now just to get a little more time with these characters. Seriously go read this book. It is sweet and sincere and beautiful and just amazing. Go. Read it. Now. I don't give out 5 stars very often for books. I am a tough critic. Usually if I really love a book I will go 4.5. This book however gets one of my rare 5 star ratings. It is that good. Go read it now.<br /><br />This review was originally posted to [...]ust so good for her, and her for him.<br /><br />Just go read this book. Seriously. Do it now.

B0088W6IMQ|5.0|stargate is one of my favorite shows all of them this one and universe are the best though. universe being #1
B00D5LC4GY|1.0|Sorry to say I didn't really get a chance since the game wouldn't open on my K.F.<br />Might be good just don't know
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a beautiful game,and much like the other versions, Minecraft: PE is a fun time waster with never-ending possibilities. Although it still doesn't have nearly as much as other versions, it makes up for it with grab and go capabilities. I recommend this game to any one. So worth 7 bucks.
B009LRE040|5.0|Excellent story, excellent special effects. New character development in Bruce Wayne is amazing! All three Nolan Batman films are well done and worth watching.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|i loved it so much i'm buying it on DVD. i recommend it to everyone! i hope they make a part 2.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I love this game, always liked it so this was a great find especially on the app of the day. Can't get better than free.
0470474874|5.0|Everything was as expected! Price was lowest! Would recommend.  Very informative well written book.  Helped me to work with Excel.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|This is a very fact based portrayal of the lady who found Bin Ladin. It is very slow in developing, because of all the facts that needed to be established to give the portrayal the continuity. It was very complicated and convoluted that it was hard for me to follow and understand at times, and I have read every scrap of information concerning the hunt for Bin Ladin. I felt it was a movie that was a docu-drama. It doesn't have much in the way of human story. Just the gruesome spy stuff. Language is very bad. The f word is too common in this movie for younger children.<br />It has a great representation of the raid to kill Bin Laden. It is not hokie in anyway. You can tell she listened to her military advisors to make a good representation of military actions. Looks real.
B001LM1456|5.0|loved this movie and everything about it!<br />it is a little weird now because its a Hulk i played by someone else in the Avengers.<br /><br />still cool!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It could be a fun game. It seems to need a little more work but overall it's OK. Kid friendly.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|I was wondering why Stephen King could do with the characters from the shining and this was excellent. It gives you a lot more insight into the abilities of shiners and includes some supernatural villains to help draw out that understanding.<br /><br />The characters are well developed and relatable and complement each other pretty well. It's also nice to see Danny Torrance have a happy ending.<br /><br />I recommend this for any King fan out there!
B000HKYN74|4.0|There were some great eppisodes and some sleepers. We saw most of the characters really grow. Jonathan Archer especially did.
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|its not scary at all. its really very nasty. the things that happen in the movie weren't all that necessary to include. waste of time!
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|It was awful.  Leo has really picked a bad script on this one.  I will tell everyone how bad this movie was.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Frederick Forsyth has returned to the intrigue of Rebecca's Key as well as the research of Pillars of the Earth.  Wonderful.  So a propos for our time.  Indeed, frighteningly so.
B008VVT51U|5.0|Dev Patel, Judy Dench. Maggie Smith- sometimes moves have great actors and still don't work, but this one does.  If you  are at all interested in India, that helps too.  Its a sweet story of love, friendship and mixing of cultures.  My teen daughters and I loved it, husband even liked it and teen son thowught it was ok.  He's a teenage boy, what does he know? It's a wonderful movie
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|The games concept is not so much entertaining as laborious.  When returning to the game, I couldn't return to the previous level.  Repeating them was a drag.  Some of the icons are mystifying , and I never figured out what operations they represented.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This Series is &#34;real-time exciting and applicable&#34; to our recent forays into the terrioist conflict / events / actions in our nations capital and across thre Middel East.  Loved it!!
B000S1M9LY|3.0|Not sure I'm up for the depth of verbiage this book brings. Difficult for my intellect to really grasp the concept and story line but...I do appreciate it! Going to probably take me a very, very long time to reach the last page. This is a massive read.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I enjoyed this story and plan to read the whole series, but found the writing a bit lacking.  It is perfect for the age group it is targeted at, however.  I teach middle school English and will be recommending it to my students.
B000HF0J36|4.0|The concept is as old as time - mankind trying to play god and the unintended consequences of those actions.  The movie had some twists in plots (no spoilers mentioned) that made it very enjoyable.  I've seen this several times (and will probably watch it again sometime in the future).<br /><br />Would highly recommend this !<br /><br />Brian W.
B004YXE438|5.0|I really enjoyed this game it is fun as well as keeping one on one's toes.<br /><br />I like the lock feature in<br />The easy mode.  I wish it was in the other legal led though
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The app is passable, given it is using content from the ever-incorrect Weather Channel. At least it gives a general ballpark estimate of the current conditions.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I'm NOT a fan of Tom Cruise.  I don't go for action, action, action or neat graphics instead of a plot as in the last 3 Star Wars movies.  What an utter disappointment those were, however Oblivion is probably the most realistic and probable SiFi movie to date.  After reading some of the reviews I was a little skeptical and wasn't expecting much, but the movie was well worth my time.  Actually I purchased the movie and will find it rewarding to watch at a later date.  Not 20 times mind you, but worth watching again or even a 3rd time because it's a thinkers movie.  I really believe that's why some of the other reviews are so low... These are people who are fans of action, gushy romance and having everything \\"told\\" to them.  No real thinkers in MHO.  The HD experience and visuals are breathtaking and even Tom Cruise's performance was refreshing.  Realistically most movies are 4/5 stars as there are always problems/errors with a concept, plot or technical aspect of any movie, but Oblivion deserves 5 stars because of so many 1 star ratings that I can't for the life of me understand.
B0049J3QF4|2.0|Never watched the movie, unfortunately we kept getting the following message:<br /><br />INSUFFICIENT BANDWIDTH<br /><br />This was never an issue before, we have Comcast Cable looking into it. It appears to be on their end....<br />However, &#34;CARS&#34; the movie......we'll who doesn't like that movie?!?!
B00AW57L96|4.0|Many interwoven stories are crafted to intrigue the reader. It is easy to empathise with all characters except 'the husband'.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|If you're looking at this review, I have no doubt you've already looked at professional review sites. With that said, this is a PHENOMENAL film. I am a big Denzel Washington fan, and this may not be my #1 favorite film of his, but he plays a compelling character. The story at its core is a &#34;Greek Tragedy&#34; of the anti-hero's hero.<br /><br />You will be instantly drawn to this movie from the first 30 minutes alone. The first portion has a lot of action, but this is not an action movie. I'm not sure if this is also a book, but it would also make for a compelling read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i like to keep up with the weather and i like this app much better than the other one that i had
B008M7JODC|5.0|Its an amazing show. Not just your regular science fiction, but one that makes you think. It does have great action scenes. But its mental roller coaster ride is where its at with that show. I love it and can watch it over and over and over.
0316017930|4.0|\\"Outliers\\" has been on my reading list for quite some time now, and I finally got around to it.  Along the lines of \\"Freakonomics\\", Gladwell makes connections (sometimes intuitive and sometimes uncanny) between successful people and particular attributes, including socioeconomic status, ethnic background, and birth month.<br /><br />Trust me, it's actually not as controversial as that previous sentence would make it sound.  Gladwell uses some concrete examples, such as Canadian hockey players overwhelmingly being born in the first half of the year and students at a prestigious middle school having an 80% college matriculation rate despite living in underserved, and often impoverished circumstances.  His main thesis of this book is that outliers owe quite a lot of their success to their surroundings and often, a series of very fortunate events.  In it, he offers compelling solutions (increase the length of the US academic school year and you'll see an improvement in achievement, especially among lower-income children) and stunning anecdotes (the story of Christopher Langan, an child prodigy whose potential goes unfulfilled).<br /><br />There are some short-sides to this book: in terms of advice to an individual seeking to become an \\"outlier\\", the main advice is work hard, practice a lot, and take advantage of opportunities.  Nothing really earth-shattering, though the \\"10,000 Hours\\" chapter could serve as a tangible benchmark for anyone looking to excel at a new skill.  However, Gladwell gets props for writing a very entertaining yet well-cited, pep-talking read.  It'll definitely inspire you to put in your \\"10,000 hours\\".
B009JZSC9S|5.0|My family and I look forward to watching the Good Wife.  The acting is superior, as well a the writing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So much fun, I love this game. Full of puzzles and hidden clues that keeps me trying to figure it all out. Very addictive, can't wait for more rooms!
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Five stars because it's superbly written and a real eye-opener into the whole &#34;colour&#34; issue.  I could hardly put it down!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|As always the minions are funny. This game is just like temple run and all of the others but it is so addictive. Fun Game
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|This is a show I would definitely recommend to my friends and family. A fantastic British drama, full of suspense. I was on the edge of my seat the entire season, and usually I know exactly what's going on about halfway through. Broadchurch kept throwing surprises in my direction and kept me engaged. I caught it on BBC America and purchased it from Amazon so I could watch it again and again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the series...I am now starting over and watching with my husband.  I would recommend to everyone. Great acting and storyline.
B00607EWYC|3.0|I don't know why I had a hard time getting into this book.  Just couldn't connect with the characters. I feel like I should have liked it.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|The best music player I've used in a long time. It's the default on both my phone and my computer.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Possibly the finest Si Fi series ever conceived it is a shame that it never received a wider audience while airing on TV.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|I think this app is a good one for free.  My daughter likes it and plays it often she thinks its funny.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Other than the GlaDOS-like super entity computer at the end, I felt absolutely nothing for any of the characters in this movie.  Tom Cruise played a robot-like clone, not unusual considering most of his characters are faceless emotionless blobs in recent years.  Last time he played a character that I liked was in Interview with a Vampire, so I wasn't surprised at the lackluster performance in Oblivion.  Everyone just seemed to walk from one scene to the next, feeling nothing and portraying NONE of the emotional hell that the situation would call for had it been real-life.<br /><br />I am astounded; as graphics increase, acting ability decreases on the same scale.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is awesome I haven't seen the movie but by this game I will believe if some told me it was okay I will believe them get it this game is banging
B004S5FW1U|5.0|Few books tackle the subject of Mental health in such a way as this fantastic story! So much to love!!!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I think this app is fine, especially for free.  I don't  have any paid apps to compare it to.  Overall pretty good.
0785153942|3.0|I didn't see the film, and since this was a prequel I thought it would be interesting. It was quite boring, and reminded me of the Power Rangers. Hey I grew up with them LOL.<br /><br />Also,the reporter is the cause of a breakup between two friends who run the mech. She just says \\"Oh I was a teen teehee.\\" No remorse at all, the slut.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Ingenious collection and connection of stories, events, opinions, etc. Not sure how I could have missed Vonnegut all these years. Will have to read this again and again. Everyone should.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I have been fascinated with Jobs for a very long time. It was great seeing all the little things I know placed into the big picture. This book is well written and gives what I believe is an honest telling of Jobs' legacy. Great read.
1451675046|5.0|This book is perfect for children outgrowing superstition and magical thinking. Many adults could certainly learn something from this as well.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I wanted to challenge my mind, but this doesn't have good instructions I couldn't get to the next page, I solved everything and nothing happened. Need more instructions
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is the best app I have ever played! You need to get it I think it's great!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|To be a true patriot you have to have the love of country. Chris Kyle was a true patriot!  I am honored to have been able to have read his book. God bless his family and I truly hope he is in Gods embrace at this second.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Good show. Video quality was good. Wish season 3 was on prime instant view. Six five four three two one
B00A0SICYI|3.0|I had memories of CCBB from my childhood, but they were all from the catchy song.  After watching it again with my children I saw that the story was a metaphor for WW2, the accented language was nearly impossible to understand, the gadgetry was too far dated, and all that was left was the song.  When it was over my kids couldn't tell me what the story was about because they couldn't understand the language or the plot.  Watch it for the warm, fuzzy memories, but let it go if all you remember is the song.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|simultaneously  calming and awakening.  I am an adult and I love to spend a few minutes between tasks refreshing myself with this challenging yet no pressure game.  more competetive people can time it and try for more perfect scores ona first try while laid back people can just fiddle away sans timer trying as often as necessary.  I warm up with easy levels and finish with harder levels.  makes you look think and work in new ways.  easy to figure out the rules and controls never crashes.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I was introduced to Firefly by a friend maybe a year ago.  I got about 30 minutes into the pilot and called it quits.  I didn't really care at all.  It was kind of outdated and sort of corny in a way.  Then maybe a month ago I decided to give it another shot.  After the first two episodes I was hooked.<br /><br />I ran straight through all the episodes with no hesitation.  Despite the production faults the show itself is written beautifully.  The characters are real, the acting makes them more real.  You WILL become attached to them.  You WILL miss them after you're finished.<br /><br />Actually, don't watch this show.  Watching Firefly is analogous to getting a really cute puppy that you love with all of your heart for a week and then it dies of some disease.  If you can handle the death of the puppy, go for it.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|Excellent interpretation of the book. Of course not all of Rowling's brilliant plot lines are included, but the execution of the main story line was well done.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Two thumbs up, one of the best tv series ever came out of BG.  Thank you Amazon for putting all 3 season in the Prime selection
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|I love this doll, she's beautiful! Although her boots are cheap plastic, she still makes for a beautiful pop-star. She has one of the best outfits for the Monster High dolls I've seen, and her hair is lovely! And her make-up is gorgeous.
B00EFNXPFK|4.0|Another quality recording but - 1 star for a less than 40min album. Really? S i x more word s.
B005HJ6MRO|4.0|I love this App in conjunction with my WD Personal Cloud drive!  My only complaint is that the app could do a better job of identifying apps on my mobile devices which will work with the files I am accessing.
B00CM4VC7M|4.0|I've wanted a figure like this for the past few years, and I was super happy when I found this earlier in the summer. I just got it today and its everything I imagined!<br /><br />I love the details, and how much it looks very much like Sailor Moon from the show. Its better quality then I thought, and the box has beautiful colors. I love how her stand is even unique and is a heart with stars and her name!<br /><br />However... The joints are a bit stiff, but after some use, they seem to have loosen just a little. Its a little hard to switch the hands, and the figures left arm comes off while I try to change the hands or move her arm too much, but it is easily fixed and stays once I get it the way I want it.<br /><br />The paint is good, though I have noticed a few spots where it got just a tad sloppy. There is some rub on her hands, but just a tab of white paint can fix that. The face and front fringe is a bit difficult to remove, and her pigtails want to fall out when handling, but go back to being snug if you push them back in once you've got the pose you want.<br /><br />Despite these faults, I very much love this figure and it is now sitting on my shelf, with my mini figures and manga.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|While it may sound like a strange beef to have about a movie one of the most thrilling part of the book is that the zombies are a slow moving unstoppable force. The movie depicts them as the cheetah hunting the human zebra. If I wanted to see an animal run down prey I'd watch Nat Geo; I wanted to see a great zombie movie based on a great book but all I got that remotely resembles the book is the title and a few lousy lines. Too bad, because adapting the book with flashbacks of the interviewees/survivors statements would have been much more suspenseful, engaging and entertaining, but then Brad Pitt wouldn't really be needed would he? It really is a shame that Hollywood is in the business of making money and not in the business of making entertaining movies.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I thought this was a great adaptation of the musical.  Jackman and Hathaway are incredible.  I was even impressed with Russell Crowe.  I thought it took a lot of courage to go for a role like this and I thought he not only kept up with the more Broadway experienced Jackman, but the untrained nature of his voice added to his emotional portrayal of Javert.
0312944926|5.0|I must say I see alot of people putting on here that the information in this book is not right....HELLO this books is fiction!! I for one loved it it kept me engrossed all the way through!!I admit I know nothing of NSA but I do know Dan Brown is my FAVORITE author!! Wonderful job GREAT book!!!
B000060MMI|5.0|Drunken Lullabies ; great music. oi, you are either a fan or you are not.  so why are you bothering with the reviews.  go look on u-tube if you can not make up your mind on weather you want a hard copy or not
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Nice cover.  I like the fact that it is also a stand.  It works really well when I'm lying in bed watching my Glee.  It stands very well and really doesn't move.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|I like all the songs on this album. Dominating my playlist right now. Definitely recommend buying the whole album because it is great value!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Anker® 8000 DPI High Precision Programmable Laser Gaming Mouse for PC, 9 Programmable Buttons, Weight Tuning Cartridges, Omron Micro Switches;  A fantastic mouse and readily programmable as long as you are using the right software.

B005PK553C|5.0|Surprises at every turn.. as unique a series as anyone can hope for on video, especually if you are a scifi/horror/fantasy fan
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I liked it because it was very simple and yet very real. She made the best of a terrible situation.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|It's like they took it up a couple of steps. With a new game you should say that, but with this one it is the colors, sets, missions. Everything. It is a blast to have some fun with. And of course it is Star Wars.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen this year. This is how mass effect 3 should have been told!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great. It is very easy to setup. It is to watch videos from your laptop, phone or tablet on a HD TV. All the people rated it one star either don't know how to use it or try to use it in a wrong way. This piece is well made. Whoever says it's not, I don't know what they were expecting. Yeah, it is plastic, it's not made of titanium. Setup is very simple and it just works. Streaming video from any device is just a click away. Best $35 ever spent. I am going to get more so I have one attached to every TV. Love it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very interesting little book with simple, easy to follow concepts. Have tried the first two experiments with amazing results. Looking forward to trying the others. Would highly recommend this book to anyone!
B00DW3GJK2|5.0|the flight sequences were very very good and I am a retired military flyer so was very interested in the flying work in the film<br /><br />Tora Tora Tora as a war film was quite accurate.
B005LAIIN0|1.0|World War Z: Brad Pitt sleeps through this flat movie. Pg-13 horror at its worst. His hair was nice, in a movie where he travels the world, in attempt to convince people to die instead of him. Then he has a tender make-out moment with a zombie dressed in his finest duck tape and magazines for an anti-climatic finale. The true message of the film: the loss of print media will be the first step to the zombie apocalypse. Majorly riffable fun!
B008IBP24C|5.0|The program is very well acted, lots of drama, realistic,. and humor added just at the right time. The mystery, and plotting intertwined make it a well rounded enjoyable story.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It has been a while since I've read a King book. I used to gobble them up like candy, but had moved on. The pull of seeing Danny Torrance, all grown up got me, and I'm so glad it did.  A worthy sequel, to be sure!  King fans , rejoice!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|There isn't anything bad I could say about this book except that it ended too soon.  It was beautifully written and her characters were so well developed that I found myself missing them when the book ended.
0375413405|5.0|I have this book and got it for my daughter for Christmas.  Her grandmother is French and this a complete guide for her.  Also, I won't get any more calls for recipes.  We can now have Mom and daughter talks instead of cooking tips and recipes :-}
B008K6HN8I|5.0|If you are accustomed to using Windows Explorer this app will work fine for you.<br />It is simple and straightforward.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|It is rare to like a tv show or movie better than a book but that is the case with this one.  It is memoir and reads like a diary.  The production editors for the show did a great job with story and adding interest.  Watch the series instead.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Amazing! Another page turning novel by Larson. Loved the characters, plot and pace of the book. Overall, this trilogy was the best read I've had in a long time!!!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Our 3 year old granddaughter loves this show and I will add so do the adults with her. Funny and entertaining :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game. The graphics are smooth and the tasks for the horse keep you busy enough. I enjoy training and caring for my horse. It's free. Such a steal for a great game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is one of the best games ever buy it it's worth it just saying oh an watch toby games<br />And youalwayswin
B00BKTFABE|4.0|I got this just as an 'emergency' camera but Kindle does not really have a decent camera or a forward facing camera so it's just a backup.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think any one who played this game would love this game it is a lot of fun and really addicting
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very funny writing of people's inner thoughts while dealing with such difficult and tragic situations. This book challenges you to consider what you would do.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|It lets you download maps of various states etc. Then you can zoom in to street levels. You also can pay for a version that has search and bookmark features.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|After the update this app does not work it force close and will not load...I uninstall and reinstall the app but it continues to do the same thing
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Natalie Portman is phenomenal. Mila Kunis gives a great supporting role. Barbara Hershey's envious, overbearing mother is pitch perfect.The soundtrack is awesome!
B004OC07F8|4.0|A great framework to inspire thinking in any organization in any industry! Easy to read and worth re-reading from time to time.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game! I was looking for a good puzzle game that didn't require you to continue to get lives in order to play. This game is awesome.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Great book over-all.I loved the story of her time in prison but thought there was too much background leading up to it.
B00CWVGNS8|5.0|This is an awesome movie. .. I did see this movie before the first movie but it was ok... I recommend watching both. ..
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|I started watching Broadchurch on BBC America but missed the last episode.  Bought it from Amazon because it is such a terrific series, and this was Season 1.  Sure hope they have Season because it is sure to be great too with the wonderful cast.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a well made game. Story is very intriguing and the puzzles are perfectly designed to get harder as you advance. Sorry for the shortness but I'm on a tablet.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|most amazing movies. Seen many versions. Musicals have great voices but the acting is poor.  this version contains actors with great voices.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|this is definitely a great game. It's fun to play against your kindle and against other people. I recommend it to everyone that plays backgammon and anyone that wants to learn.
B00785P2QC|4.0|great game! addictive... a little slow on the loading as the game gets bigger. add me : riskygirl<br />so many ways to play this game in the way that YOU enjoy it. decor, industry,  sales even population growth.  you can play them all and focus on your favorite.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|This game has good graphics. You are able to do about of missions or activities<br />You want to do in the game
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I can't wait for the season premier tonight!  Yay Season 5 and I hope Alicia figures out what a jerk Peter is and feels free to be with Will once he's not her &#34;boss.&#34;  Peter is corrupt and will use her, Will can be cold, yes, but he's true.  I'm voting for passion over duty.  The kids will be fine.  Also I don't see the thing between Diane and her ballistics expert working out--he's got an eye and a taste for younger, more attractive women, and Diane is just too awkward for him.  And why in the world would she risk losing the state supreme court position by insisting they marry NOW.  It just feels false, but I can't wait to see how it all plays out, anyway.  Anyway, I've recommended this show to everyone I know, it's my favorite guilty pleasure, right next to Revenge. :)
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really enjoy this version of mahjong. I only wish all game trunks we're free.I enjoy free games as I Don't have extra money to pay.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love the realistic legal situations. I also like the family situations and personal relationships that make the show interesting.
B0036S4CTS|3.0|Written well, but didn't like the ending.  Emma character needs more self confidence and Dexter needs to drink a little less. Would have preferred a happy ever after ending.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|This is not a book for the quick cook, someone who just wants to get the job done with minimal time or fuss. This is a book for a person who is curious about cooking, its history, some of the chemistry, the basic concepts behind it. It's for the person who is willing and able to get excited about cooking.<br /><br />The books organization into four sections based upon the classical physical elements, while not perfect (as Pollan himself notes when he points out that beer, filed under the &#34;earth&#34; category as a fermented food, actually makes use of all four elements), is nonetheless pleasing and somewhat helpful.<br /><br />The four basic elements he lists are fire, water, air, and earth, with the four basic preparation techniques being barbecue/grilling (fire), stewing/braising (water), leavening (air), and fermentation (earth). He interviews and learns from cooks specialized in each of these areas, and passes their knowledge on to his readers. He includes information from the natural sciences, about the biological and chemical mechanisms underlying the transformations we call &#34;cooking&#34;. He goes into various theories as to how various forms of cooking came about, including a fairly extensive section about what is called the &#34;Cooking Hypothesis&#34; of human evolution.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|This past week I picked up three albums that were new releases for the week. The Diving Board was one of them. It's the one I keep playing over and over! Early on I had heard that this album was just Elton and his piano, at first I thought that might mean it was going to be a slow boring album, this is not the case. The feel of the album does sort of recall Elton's early albums \\"Elton John\\" or \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\" or \\"Madman Across The Water\\". There is also a laid back jazzy feel to most of the songs, overall it's just a great album to put on and sit back and listen. I must say that although I like the entire album, a few tracks stand out: \\"Oscar Wilde Gets Out\\", \\"A Town Called Jubilee\\", \\"Home Again\\" and \\"Mexican Vacation (Kids In The Candlelight)\\". When you have Bernie's lyrics and Elton music, how can you miss though really?<br /> Elton's musical journey has taken him pretty much full circle with this album. He has recently said that he's no longer interested in getting a huge pop hit, he just wants to make music that he likes. I find that when an artist gets to that point in their career they end up making some of the best music, this is no exception.<br /> For those wondering about the songs being just Elton and his piano, this isn't the case, he does have other musicians with him on drums, guitars etc. His piano though is the centerpiece of each track. I believe it was Rolling Stone that said The Diving Board could possible be the album of the year, I agree, I don't know that a finer album has been released in 2013.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|If you enjoy Baz Luhrman movies, this is great.  If you don't know this director, you may find the movie a little odd.  There are some fantastic visual effects.  The story was interesting, though if you have read the book, I guess you know that.  As usual, Leonardo DiCaprio enveloped his character and Toby Maguire was tepid.
B008R14YBK|5.0|I was 1st exposed to Bridgit Mendler on the Disney channel and after hearing at least 3 songs that I liked, I went ahead and purchased the entire CD. It's fun, upbeat music that you can relate to. One of my favorite songs is &#34;I'm a blond&#34; which I am definitely not, but I still love the song. I eagerly await her next album.
B002361MLA|5.0|A book that I wished I had read many, many years ago.  Some may say that there isn't really anything &#34;original&#34; about Tolle's text.  And there isn't really.  Its a distillation of ancient wisdom, drawing mainly from Zen Buddhism but also Christianity and Sufism.  And that's OK.  The value of this book is the teachings on who we really are, in a clear and engaging and forceful writing style.  By the way, definitely not a &#34;new age&#34; book, rather a highly resonant and warm take on how to be human.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Lee Child's 11th outing with the indomitable Jack Reacher starts with the news that one of his former colleagues is dead and others are missing. Child delves back into Reacher's past with the elite crew of military investigators he headed prior to his decision to leave the military for good and start a life of wandering from one adventure to the next. The characters are much like Reacher himself. He teams up again with Frances Neagley, the only non-com on his former team and the one who figured out how to track him down by depositing an amount in his bank account as a signal. She doesn't like to be touched, and when she does connect it's usually bad for the bad guys. Reacher's past comes back as he examines the lives of those in his former unit. He wonders for perhaps the first time if the lifestyle he chose, that of an invisible man, is more like that of a bum. Could be. Reacher doesn't really care. He has his toothbrush and enough to get by until the next time. This novel is a slow build and in it Reacher learns the value of new technology, especially cell phones. The conflict is superb because it takes all the intellect of the remaining special investigators to clue into the potential problem that caused one of their colleagues -- the family man who had a little kid just like him -- to be tossed from a helicopter into the desert.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Didn't think I'd like a book like this one. But I read the entire thing in 4 days! I am on to the next!
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Synopsis:<br /><br />5 stars for the brilliant thinking.  Minus 0.5 stars for getting on his soapbox for at least half the book.  And minus another half for the lack of concrete advice.<br /><br />This is a really good book to read, in my opinion.  Mr. Taleb is a deep thinker and quite unbeholden to fashion.  He makes extremely valid points.<br /><br />However, you will have to put with his rants (not too harsh a word, I think even he would agree).<br /><br />And you will to develop your own strategies from his principles.  The best compliment I can give this book is to say that I will endeavor to do so.  But he really does not provide much ready guidance.<br /><br />***********************************<br /><br />The long-winded details:<br /><br />What is fragility?<br /><br />Let's take the removal of unemployment risk, at an individual level.  You can try to legislate layoffs out of existence (and that has huge costs across an economy, as Southern Europe is figuring out).  However, starting with the good intentions of avoiding what is very stressful to an individual, you are putting that person at huge risk if the worse should happen and they somehow do get laid off or their company goes out of business.<br /><br />You are starting out with good intentions (not from an employer viewpoint, but that's another story).  But even if you discount the problems this causes across the economy as a whole, you are building up massive fragility in an individual.  If they do get laid off, they will never have encountered or been prepared for that situation, with employers not keen to take on unsackable workers that only know how to do one thing.  Not a theoretical issue - get laid off past 50 in Europe and you will quite possibly not find a job again.<br /><br />Anti-fragility might be a society that chooses to recognize that employment can end, allows for it, plans for it and even funds initiatives to take advantage of those events to enhance worker skills.  Trite, too business-friendly and wishful thinking?  Yes, let's not hide our head in the sand, unemployment is a huge problem, no matter how a government handles it.  But pretending you can stop it from ever happening is not helpful.<br /><br />Another message is to repeat, very often, that, by definition, an event of an unknown & unplanned magnitude is really difficult to plan for.  And you should not assume that its effect will be qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that of a smaller magnitude event. Falling down 30 feet is not falling down 3 feet ten times.  At best, you can assess your exposure if the event magnitude exceeds your historically observed range, but you often can't assign probabilities.  Just because you can't reliably predict events which have never happened (to your knowledge) doesn't meant they won't happen.  Extrapolation is not necessarily a good guide to the future - turkeys might feel quite happy the week before Thanksgiving.<br /><br />These are all things that feel, at a gut level, quite logical and I love to them formalized, quantified and explained.  And, yes, many of the individuals and institutions criticized (more on that later) deserve it entirely.<br /><br />One spot-on criticism is our society's glorification of theoreticians vs. practitioners.  I work in programming and much theoretical consultant/academic advice privileges complexity and cleverness over simplicity, frugality, and maintainability.  Not great when you realize initial implementations are a fraction of the cost in my industry.  Yet, many breakthroughs have come from academics.<br /><br />Another really nifty bit are the somewhat technical graphs at the end of the appendix (I feel they shouldn't have been hidden there).  They really start to build a mathematical model of what he is saying.  This is a clever guy, he's locked horns with researchers and specialists, using math. This part is the science behind his big talk and it looks like it stands up.<br /><br />Up to now, we are doing really well.<br /><br />The cons do NOT invalidate the message, but they make for a somewhat frustrating read.<br /><br />First, and this is actually a fairly serious shortcoming, he spends more time criticizing than recommending.  The barbell strategy is one of the few exceptions and he gives the example of choosing to live in a moderately expensive rented apartment over buying into a currently hot property market.  Worse can happen is that you keep on paying the rent, but you are insulated from a market crash and could in fact benefit handsomely from it (exactly my current situation).  Or plan for a job to pay the bills, even as you try something more daring professionally.<br /><br />But on the whole, these are the exceptions.  We get plenty of \\"don't do this\\", much less \\"I recommend this\\".  He tells us that options are often unrecognized freebies outside of financial markets where they are priced.  But never gets around much to giving us examples of common life optionality.<br /><br />Second, Mr. Taleb, is, to put it mildly, quite opinionated.  I share some, possibly more than a few, of his specific prejudices myself, but still...<br /><br />We get page after page of criticism of various individuals.  Many deserve it, but it becomes a bit less justified when entire professions are targeted.  Bankers? Well, they're not the most popular, true and many execs should be sweeping streets even if their banks were bailed out.  But surely, the author does not want to abolish money-lending entirely?<br /><br />Then we have university professors.  To hear the author, worthless one and all.  Yeah, I can't say I think much of the cutthroat world of tenure-seeking and the rent-seeking of highly paid professors who barely bother with their undergrads.  But, are our scientific advances of the last century really entirely due to the noble efforts of self-directed dilettantes, as the author sees himself?  And those folks certainly took on a load of risk before getting that tenure - witness all the grads working menial jobs.<br /><br />The author has an extreme fondness for old times, what with the Greeks being the wisest of all.  Slaves?  Phah, people in suits are slaves nowadays, so Athenian slavery does not invalidate its society one bit.<br /><br />He contradicts himself at times and loves to speak about things he may not be as qualified to speak about as he thinks.  Case in point:  he hates sugar and blames many health issues on its new, unnatural and excessive consumption. I'm on board.  Then he goes on to say that the whole case linking high blood pressure and salt consumption is a modern, unproven, fad.  Salt was a luxury item in many ancient societies, because it wasn't widely available.  Its modern consumption is quite high and in no way similar to that in older times.  So, sugar, bad because unnatural, but salt, good because ...?<br /><br />On the whole though, he manages to vent his vitriol and opinions in an erudite, humorous and interesting manner, as he has an impressive body of knowledge.  And it is refreshing to see a treatment of a dry, academic, subject where the gloves have come off entirely.  But it makes for a much longer book than necessary if you just wanted him to stick to his subject matter.e doing really well.<br /><br />The cons do NOT invalidate the message, but they make for a somewhat frustrating read.<br /><br />First, and this is actually a fairly serious shortcoming, he spends more time criticizing than recommending.

B000W94FE6|2.0|Did a perusal of the book and didnt like it at all.<br /><br />It was very wordy and didnt get down to the actual point quick enough and in a concise manner which is how to actually get into the flow
B000V63AVY|5.0|This album is an excellent collection of classic songs. Brings back some awesome memories from the time I was in college.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downtown Abbey is a snapshot into the lives of two &#34;families&#34; in a great house....the lords who live above and the commoners who live below and serve them. The intricacies of their lives intermeshing provide a realistic view of this past age in jolly old England! The realism is sometimes TOO real! Can't wait for Season 4!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is the best WW2 app ever.This is totally worth 99 cents<br />If you like world war 2 weapons this is the app for you.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I do enjoy this game - it's challenging - I wish there was a &#34;replay&#34; button so I can play a game over if I lose -now I have to hit the back button till I get to beginning.
B000FVQM2Y|3.0|This is an interesting film, it tells the story of a college kid investigating the death of his ex-girlfriend. What makes it stand out is that the film is presented in the style of film noir, with the teenager in the role of a gumshoe detective. It's a nice idea and follows a similar plot to the investigations with a few twists and turns along the way.<br /><br />Everyone does a good job in their roles, in particular the lead. Without the style gimmick it's a solid enough film, everyone plays their part and the story unfolds at a decent pace. The style does set it apart, but also proves it undoing.<br /><br />The issue is that it comes across as a student film with the kids playing roles of the noir style. It's well filmed which does set it up a step higher than that, but still the impression remains. While it does present an interesting juxtaposition it did hamper my enjoyment somewhat.<br /><br />That leaves it as a film that's a bit tricky to rate, it's a decent enough film, but not as entertaining as it might have been. Still it's not a bad watch by any means and it does stand apart from many other teen movies, so worth checking out.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This is one awesome cop show...totally intense!!!  Great acting, good scripts, and very addicting.  Can't get enough!!!  Love to watch!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I especially enjoyed the way it was written, being made to love characters only to have them taken away. I want to read things that make me feel real emotions. And Wool did the trick. Not only was I on the edge of my seat in suspense but also did I yell in anger at the pages and secretly cry to myself in sadness and joy. Hugh Howey is an inspiration to an aspiring author. Despite one's reading preferences, Wool is a top choice for every reader, fan and browser alike.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Great real life portrayal of zombies! Was glued to the story the whole time. And I love brad pitt ! :-)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I have to say this was an excellent story following 3 main characters. Would highly recommend. I will read this author again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and easy game was great to pass the time. Not very difficult, especially once u get the hang of it..
B00F6HOW4M|2.0|He's a terrible rapper (singer??). Only \\"hold on we're going home\\" is really good track. The rest is complete garbage. I really should've previewed each track before purchase like I normally do but I guess I was willing to try to understand better what Drake is all about. My intuition was right, he's garbage. Oh well. I bought it, I can at least say with good evidence that he sucks. I feel old thinking about how rap actually used to mean something... <sigh>
B00459EZLW|5.0|Was very good. Loved the special effects and story line.<br />Will tell friends about it. Wish they would come up with more characters to relate to.
B0023SDPS6|2.0|seems he left self out of story. too many others in this book. maybe he was'nt needed for this particular one.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Loved it I keep playing everyday. But wish I could earn more coins per game.  Without having to buy them. Some people like to play games but can not afford to get to the higher levels.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|This was an exciting, fast-paced movie. The way they defeated the zombies was very clever. The action starts right from the beginning. However, it was nothing like the book. The only thing it shared was a name.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I love this app. I had it for awhile, but recently it was acting up, and I didn't receive messages until 30 minutes after they were sent. I logged out, and tried to log back in, but now all it says is &quot;this is taking longer than it should, try again in a bit.&quot; This was over a week ago.. I'm irritated..
B0063M22QO|5.0|let yourself go to another &#34;space&#34; away from the daily mundane. relaxing and refreshing to the soul when you play mahjong for awhile.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is completely free to play, unless you want to spend some cash on in app purchases. It is fuj to play, loads of collecting and trading to be done. Special rooms, slots, daily tournaments. I play it on Facebook and on my android.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I may like it more if I were using all the features.  But just not that into it.  Use it to check the time occasionally but not concerned about using the alarm.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Habit forming fun way to waste time! I say \\"go for it\\" because if you have time to read this review you have time to waste and if you are going to waste time you should enjoy it while you do.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|It is good to just quickly take a look and know what the weather in my area will be like.  The big TV stations are close but not always covering your area
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have Minecraft on the PC,  and this game is totally awesome!!! Don't listen to anyone who dislikes this app.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Slydris has all the hallmarks of a great puzzle game. It's easy to learn but takes a while to really master. The graphics are solid and the choice to have light or dark pieces is a nice touch. The music and sound effects add to the fun and heighten the excitement as the levels progress. This game works great on both my Nexus 4 and 7 and I've spent countless hours enjoying it!
B008C20TDG|4.0|I needed to understand the &#34;why&#34; behind the elimination of grains, dairy, legumes, etc, and this book was very helpful.  Enough science, but stated in simple enough terms for lay people to understand.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This is one of the coolest books I've ever read. All I want now is for the answer to this problem!!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Engaging from the very beginning - great cast - amazing plots w/ believable outcomes, guest stars who fit the bill!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It's just as good as all the rest.  This one starts off quickly, I'm not done but loving it already.
B008220D5K|2.0|I love Leslie Mann and her kids.  Paul Rudd is just OK.  He's at his best when he's just being Paul Rudd which means that he's not really acting.  Jason Segal, still the low key sex-perv always gives me the creeps.  That being said, I watched the movie and came away with less than when I started.<br /><br />I'm 65 yo.  I'm a 28 yo trapped in a 65 yo body.  I like to drop the Eff-Bomb as much as the next guy but this movie was over the top.  Given that I am old enough to be Paul's and Leslie's father I'd have to look in the mirror and ask myself 'Where the Eff did I go wrong?',moreover, their poor kids, my grand-kids are also so screwed up with terrible values and priorities...and poor Maude never sang but really got to be fully self expressed in a premenstrual kind of way (poor kid).<br /><br />This is more an indictment and a reflection of what has become of offspring of the Greatest Generation and what's wrong with this country.  Did I find it funny...yes, at times.  Unfortunately, I could barely recognize Megan Fox who was funny...10-12 times, well, 20-30 times during the movie and I absolutely hate Lena Dunham after watching her implode on her HBO series, Girls...<br /><br />Well, I guess you can tell that I thought that the film was mediocre at best, that Judd has shot his wad and is crying out for help and so, I'm going to end my review on that note.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|best one that like plus stargate all the wach all time plus love star trek  too seen all then all time
B00F35BV64|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I love the characters. They did a great job finding the actors to portray the 'younger' original Star Trek cast.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I wasI thought the book was so well written,the story so well told. It opened my eyes to the difficulties facing our youth topday in school..I still wonder about the murder gene?  the ending left me with many questions.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This season just improves on season one, which was a hard act to follow. Great writing, great acting and enough intrigue to keep you coming back for more.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|My kids loves this movie. We bought the digital version and they have watched it about 15 times. Great father/daughter relationship story and the father struggling to let her have her own independence. Great movie!
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|I never cease to wonder at Spielberg's ability to move between different genres and deliver a result that others could only do if it were their specialty.  The seal of approval that author J. G. Ballard gives to this production speaks volumes for the treatment given to this incredible story.  The choice of Christian Bale to portray Jim Graham was a masterstroke of casting.<br /><br />When the movie begins, it is very easy to develop a near instant dislike of young Jim - a spoilt little English rich kid living in an enclosed world of upper class British privilege. But when the Japanese invade Shanghai, he suddenly finds himself alone and having to fend for himself. All too suddenly, separated from his parents, we see his character evolve into one who understands that to survive he must do whatever it takes with his own judgement as his guide and what he learns from two American seamen, Basie and Frank (John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano).<br /><br />Inevitably, Jim and his new found companions are interned and it is in Soochow Creek Prison Camp he really learns to survive, finds courage in pursuit of doing what is right and earns genuine respect from his captors.<br /><br />Jim is a complex child but under the guiding hand of Steven Spielberg, Christian Bale delivers all of the traits and emotions that make up this character in a powerful performance - a performance you would not expect from one so young and making his debut movie.<br /><br />The supporting cast is equally well chosen and combine to make Empire of the Sun what it is - a 5 star movie of astonishing brilliance.  To not see it is to deprive yourself of a real piece of cinematic excellence.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|It's a different game, it has kept me entertained but it's still angry birds. I am getting tired of angry birds this will be the last one I buy.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|I can play this game for hours. Quick easy game if you like tower defense games you will like this.
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|Brandon Flowers does a GREAT job on this album! I'm a huge Killers fan and after this, I'm an even bigger Flowers fan!
B001I45UFC|5.0|I read this book with my middle school students and they really loved it! They are ready to read the others in the series now!
B000VI12ZS|5.0|What story line? Perhaps the answer belongs to the viewer. A reasonable portrayal of the battles fought for Saipan. The Japanese High Command  was not expecting such an action and the fighting was extremely brutal. Navaho encoding was used to great advantage by the Marines and Saipan was no exception. Follow the path of cultural understand and respect that is the underlying message. More than enough action for a war movie and the runtime is too long but the acting is a positive. If you are interested in actual historical value, choose a documentary with original footage.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I didn't enjoy this book at all. I thought it was predicable and the people in it were not likeable at all. I forced myself to finish it thanking it would get better but it never did.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is the best app ever. I used to always have to call my friends. I would always forget their phone number. Also now all my friends can go in a conversation together. I highly advise to get this app!!!!!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great series. Don't miss it if you have any interest in legal and courtroom shows  In addition, there are a multitude of subplots going on at the same time and that's what makes the show so interesting.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Review will contain MINOR spoilers<br /><br />The song of Ice and Fire is book series that encompasses a total of six books (technically seven although the fourth and fifth are pretty much one book split in half) and this is the third book in the series and it offers the closest thing to closure and answers to a lot of the stories that have been started, while also continuing some and beginning others that will presumably lead to the end of the series. There are 12 POV chapters in the book (10 main characters, one prologue and one epilogue). The most important plot lines that the book covers are:<br /><br />1.) The Wall. If Storm of Swords belongs to any character, it probably belongs to Jon Snow. I'm afraid to say that in the last book I was starting to become bored with Jon's story and the story of the watch in general. It started to get a little repetitive to me with all of that wandering around beyond the wall chapter after chapter and the leader's of the watch like Mormont and the Halfhand and their constant warnings about the danger beyond the wall. Now we finally see it. Jon was captured by the wildlings at the end of Clash of Kings and it opens with him being introduced to Mance Rayder, the king beyond the wall. Jon's plan to spy on the wildlings is complicated by Ygritte, whose Jon's feelings for become harder to ignore and Rayder's constant questions of Jon's allegiance and the state of the watch. Needless to say, a confrontation between Mance and The Watch is brewing and Jon's got to figure out how to warn the Watch and whether or not he wants to.<br /><br />Through Sam, we also get to see the other danger beyond the wall; the Others. The Others continue to stalk the Watch as they make their way back from The Great Ranging and you finally get to see their power and some of their abilities.<br /><br />2.) The War between The Starks and The Lannisters. When main character Ned Stark was executed by King Joffrey in A Game Of Thrones, it kicked off a war between the two powerful houses that divided up the realm. After his father's death, his son Robb was anointed The King In The North by his father's bannermen in an effort to avenge his father, depose the Lannister's and make the North independent lands once again. Despite never having lost a single battle, Robb has begun to lose the war and has found himself with his back against the wall mostly due to the forming of an alliance between the Lannisters and House Tyrell, whose army boosts over 100k, and his mother secretly releasing Jaime Lannister and the Ironmen's seige and holding of the North. While Tywin Lannister considers the war basically over, the King in the North comes up with one final plan which may win the war for the North but he must put his trust in some unlikely allies to pull off the victory. But can they do it?<br /><br />3.) Dany's quest in the Free Cities. The last book ended with The Mother of Dragons leaving Qarth and getting enough money for a ship or three. She now continues her through other free cities in an attempt to gather support and build an army for her own journey to Westeros. Assisted as by right hand man Jorah Mormont and joined by two new advisers in Strong Belwas and his squire Artisan Whitebeard. Dany gets her first experiences at building alliances and creating the army she plans to use to retake her families throne. But the more Dany travels the free cities the more she realizes that she will have to do things she never thought acceptable like buying an army of slave soldiers. The more horrific things Dany sees, though, the more she has trouble dealing with and begins to take the first steps into become a leader and decides to what she can to help these oppressed people. Can Dany become a good leader or will she start to lose her way just as her father the Mad King once did?<br /><br />4.) The marriage of Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell. The alliance that was pivotal in the Lannister's defeating Stannis Baratheon last book is too be cemented. Much of the book goes into the planning of the royal wedding as well as all the political double dealing going on behind the scenes. At the center of this is Tyrion Lannister, the former Hand of the King who was also essential in defeating Stannis, gravely wounded after the battle and replaced as Hand by his father Lord Tywin. The dwarf still continues to try and maintain the alliance that was made in victory, in spite of the actions of his own house trying to minimize his roll in running the realm, as well as trying to control the amount of blood shed between the various armies in the city, especially after the arrival of House Martell, an old house with an old grudge against the Tyrell's and Tyrion's father Tywin....<br /><br />Other smaller plot lines include:<br /><br />-Defeated Self-Crowned King and prophesied lord of the light Stannis Baratheon refuses to surrender after his utter defeat in the Battle of the Blackwater. Back at Dragonstone with the remnants of his army, Stannis begins to plan his next moves to take the crown. But with the outlook so bleak and the red priestess Melissandre in his ear, can Stannis maintain his sanity and his integrity? Can Davos (who did survive the Blackwater) keep Stannis from completely succumbing to the red woman's influence?<br /><br />-Bran Stark still continues his trip North, hiding with the Reed's and his mentally handicapped servant Hodor as they attempt to escape to beyond the wall to find the Three Eyed Crow. This was the storyline I probably liked the least in the book. Everything always stays so vague to me on what exactly the Three Eyed Crow could for Bran other than help him control his Warg abilies, Bran's ability to enter control animals while he sleeps. Bran's storyline here doesn't really answer much and feels like a bridge to a bigger story in a future book.<br /><br />-Sansa Stark is still a hostage in King's Landing and with her brother's Bran and Rickon believed dead by everyone, the Lannister's begin executing their plans for the lady who would become Heir to Winterfell should anything happen to her brother Robb.<br /><br />-After escaping Harrenhal, Arya continues her trip to meet up with her family along with her friends Gendry and Hot Pie though they quickly are found by some of her father's own bannermen things are not as they seem. I don't want to say anymore because Arya's story is so good and she has the most POV chapters of any other character to tell it. The book almost belongs to her just as much as it does Jon.<br /><br />-Jaime Lannister, freed by Lady Stark at the end of the last book, is escorted back to the North with the promise that he will bring Sansa and Arya Stark back in return for her releasing him. At first underestimating his guard and escort, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime is soon humbled in more ways than one and begins to think about what his life has meant to this point, being a man without honor.<br /><br />This is easily the best of the first three books and I highly recommend that you read this immediately after finishing the first two books.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of the most believable, yet complex post-apocalyptic tales I have read. Much food for thought, and relevant to today's world. If you weren't paranoid before, you may be after you read this one. I'm into the next book, &#34;Shift,&#34; now...
B005OP2928|5.0|There are so few comedy sitcoms that have what I consider the perfect cast. Barney Miller, WKRP in Cincinnati, News Radio all had the perfect actors in the perfect roles. The timing and the scripts were fantastic. Modern family is such a show. The cast is perfect, their characters are perfect and the scripts are perfect.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I was disappointed in this version of Mahjong. It is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was bad in so many ways.  I, like other readers, cannot figure out how it was on the best seller list..at all.  The ending notwithstanding, other features of the book were more annoying and distracted from the plot.  The writing is very sophomoric, although I did like the double entries from each main character.  I felt like I was reading a book written by a fifteen year old boy, with a thesaurus in one hand and Penthouse magazine in the other. The verbiage was poor.  I read through the first half quickly, then, upon discovering that Amy was a sociopath and self absorbed \\"nut bag \\" I did a speed read through the rest of the book.  A friend of mine wanted my take on the book, so I felt I needed to finish it. I seriously doubt I will read any more of Gillian Flynn's books.  I wasted precious reading time.<br />That being said, I think I might want to see the move.  Just to see if the movie script follows the horrible written script, or if they will allow the characters to speak like intelligent adults instead of high school boys in gym class.
B00F91G5BS|1.0|I could have also done the World War ZZzzzz... but I am sure that's been done to death.<br /><br />+ There are a few action elements of this film that make it interesting,<br />+ and none of the performances are terrible.<br />- But it is ultimately a feeble, derivative, and repetitive film.<br />- When the same exact scenario repeats it self 5 times in a film, it's hard to get a new reaction.<br />- There are too many moments where suspension of disbelief depends entirely on ignoring any semblance of real world behavior or logic.<br />- Predictable and ultimately uninteresting<br /><br />The movie is so lazy, it left me with little energy to give it a more in depth review.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! If you are into Nicholas Sparks movies or books, you will really like this. Really good buy, the shipping was super fast!
B002O2THRO|3.0|The Great Gatsby was very enjoyable taking the reader back to a time in history that's sure to enchant you.  It's fun to watch a movie that entertains, it's just a bit riské but not enough to make you want to turn it off. I liked it.<br />Laurette Connelly
B005COO1X6|4.0|Haven't read this book yet, but its Steven King!  How could you go wrong.  Always enjoyed his books and movies based on his books. Know I will have fun reading this book.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Don't need to spend any money but easily run out off energy. Very addictive but very interesting lots to do and find.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Where to begin?  This fellow is a truly wonderful talent in both songwriting and presentation.  I trade CDs with my brother-in-law and in the last 40 or so I've given him he thinks this is by far the best.  I'd have to agree.  The voice and the lyrics all contribute to a major talent.  I'm always interested in hooks and the melodies are so infectious that I'm drawn in to each cut. I've just ordered two more of his CDs.  Since they are imports you pay a premium price but I'm happy to pay more for such a gifted musician.
B00C9G22R2|4.0|I tried this DVD in my PS3, and it had no sound. It plays normally in a standard DVD player.
B009JZWO3I|3.0|Material got a bit stale and formulaic, but a lot of changes were made during season 4, and I am looking forward to seeing season 5 and what happened...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|okay so I got this game before I saw the movie. But why? Well, you see I really wanted to see that movie and I just saw the video and got it. Now I'm gonna kick yo butt in despicable me minion rush!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006O5XYWG|4.0|Planet of the Apes fan from the start. It was pretty entertaining...can't wait to see the next one! I hope they keep the jokes and ironies coming...
B0094K1MH2|3.0|Not sure if it was the movie itself or the fact that this movie had issues with streaming to my TV. It kept freezing up, I have never had that problem with other movies
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|I have to say that I've been a huge Dragonball fan for the last 15+ years, so its really surprising to me that I have never owned a Dragonball figure. I mostly collect Kotobukiya's Bishoujo line which are non-articulated figures, so I am not the biggest fan of articulated ones. For some reason they always look a little off to me. However, earlier this year, when I found that this non-articulated figure would be coming out, I knew it was a must buy for me. And now that it has arrived, I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Standing at just over 6\\" tall, the sculpt on this is just perfect. The battle damage is incredibly detailed. Also, unlike a lot of figures of Dragonball characters I've seen in the past, Goku's face is spot on, as if it was sculpted straight from the manga and anime by Akira Toriyama himself. But I especially love the translucent special effects from the tips of his Super Saiyan hairstyle to the powerful golden aura surrounding him. Keep in mind, however, that the box says that this item is for ages 15 and up, so it certainly is NOT A TOY. I wouldn't be surprised to see the price go up in the future. But right now, its a steal at only $33.99 through Amazon.<br /><br />I now can't wait until January when Super Saiyan Trunks comes out. If all goes well and this new Zero line proves to be as popular as I think it will be, other Dragonball Zero gems will come out like Vegeta, Piccolo, and Gohan. If you are a fan of Dragonball, it comes highly recommend by me. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up before they either become too expensive or hard to find. You certainly will not regret it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome all of my friends have it so I can go to there barns and see there horses
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|not a bad game, can get a bit challenging at times and the different attributes of the birds can make it a little confusing at times
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|\\"Gatsby\\" is a movie about would-be writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) as he leaves the Midwest and comes to New York City in the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz, bootleg kings, and sky-rocketing stocks. Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), and across the bay from his cousin, Daisy (Carey Mulligan), and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan  (Joel Edgerton). It is thus that Nick is drawn into the captivating world of the super rich, their illusions, loves and deceits.<br /><br />Gatsby is based on the classic American novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  I remember this being required reading in high school back in the day as an example of a great novel.  Although I didn't really appreciate the novel for what it was back then, I realize now that this was a great telling of the times in the 20's.<br /><br />The director does a good job at recreating the era of the 1920s, but also gives it a modern edge and a flair that could only be captured in the world of film.  Some people are critizing the modern music choices in the film as opposed to the music of the era, but that didn't bother me and I thought gave it a good backdrop for the excesses of the time that reflect some of the excesses of the modern era.<br /><br />Gatsby is beautifully made and shows the glitz and glam of the era.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio does a good job with the character and I feel at times doesn't get enough credit for playing character roles.  In fact, all the main characters do admirable jobs in bringing their characters to life.<br /><br />The 2013 Gatsby is not the 1925 version of the Great Gatsby, and it simply can't be but that doesn't necessarily a bad thing.  This movie brings a unique modern retelling and to me was worth watching.  Maybe not as classic as the book but a decent movie nonetheless.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Well done. Totally engaging. Wonderful, believable, characters. Gorgeous scenery and costumes. Wholly believable and completely engrossing storyline with heart-string-tugging joy and sadness.
0152023984|5.0|I love reading this book to my son, and it is so well written that even adults will like the story. It is a good book to introduce to any child about to take a big trip or be away from home.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|If like Painter Crowe and his gang, you will love this latest adventure. And you'll learn tons along the way!!!
1781162646|5.0|I'm a little tired of the whining about this book. It isn't King's best novel, but then I seriously doubt if he meant it to be. It's an intertwined murder mystery and a coming of age tale written by the best author of our time. Let me say that again... it's a murder mystery written specifically for the Hard Case Crime imprint. Read it for what it is... a good story about a young man learning some important life lessons. On the way he manages to solve a crime and also helps a young boy and his mother going through an end of life struggle. Pennywise the clown isn't murdering kids. Stop expecting King to rewrite \\"IT\\" every time. This is a good book and a great example of the variety and breadth of King's talent.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|Laid-back good music. It's fun and a great album to ride to and to vibe off of too. It has a bluesy soul vibe to it that I really dig.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I like the idea behind a pseudo history, haven't seen it done this well before but it was a good read
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just like owning a real horse. Able to feed and groom. Then do competitions :-) I would definitely recommend this app
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great for all ages, young and old alike. My kids, nieces, and cousins have a blast playing this game.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I'm liking it better than Dungeon Hunter. But the only issue I have is the in app purchases. They can get a bit expensive.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This just left me SPEECHLESS. It was a great, funny, clever, and entertaining movie. When things tie up, you do nothing but smile, and think back about your earlier reaction. It's near impossible to see outside the entire box, because there are so many boxes inside each other. A truly great movie, and I recommend it to all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Super awesome game!!! Everything about this game is pure fun! It's like having a real horse, everyone should have this game
B003UYUP5I|5.0|The playbook is one of its kind, if there is any other book that discuss a similar subject, I really had a great fum time reading it!!!
B00846TRHY|5.0|really powerful movie.  I don't care if the story was stretched or not........this guys mission gives us inspiration to find our purpose in life, and stop being arm chair warriors and actually get up and seize the moment and make that change now...God or no God.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I think it's weird because  it's kinda babyish and cool at the  same time an what world would it not be
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Action, action, action - little of it believable. The ending leaves things well set up for \\"Now You See Me 2\\", etc.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've downloaded many solitaire games.  But, this is the best one yet. Thank you, MobilityWare.  I take it with me everywhere.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|The 1400 plus people who gave this disgraceful movie a 5 Star rating are living testiments to the total ignorance and lack of critical taste in America today. These cretins almost certainly have never read the novel or seen any competent stage production. My wife and I have seen both the original London and New York productions and performances by touring companies in Los Angeles and Chicago. Since this is our favorite musical we were simply sickned by this abomination.<br /><br />Please take an evening and sit down and listen to either the original London or Broadway productions and you will understand my criticism.<br /><br />Let's face it, Hollywood is incapable of bringing great musicals to the screen. Picking great popular actors for starring roles does not gurantee success. Crowe and Jackman were both just awful! Talking, rather than singing lyrics in a sing through (where all dialogue is sung not spoken) just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />dj
B0023SDPS6|2.0|I bought this because I love the TV show. After about 2 chapters I was so bored I quit reading it.
B005HEFB6M|3.0|Compared to the preceding versions this one was campy, corny and poorly written at times. The Next Generation was probably the best of the lot......the original excluded obviously.
