B00A20PYP4|5.0|Great show for everyone to enjoy!  Set between the fairy-tale world and the small, real-world town of Storybrook.  Good acting, writing, and screenplay, as well as a compelling plot.  Recommend to anyone who enjoys fairy tale/fantasy television!
0316228532|5.0|My sole intention of writing this review is to counteract some of the baffling one star reviews this fanatic novel has received. It's painfully obvious that 90 percent of the negative reviews for this novel were either expecting Harry Potter Part 8 (seriously, did you not even bother to see what the novel was about before buying??), did not read the book, or have a very low attention span to go along with a low reading level and expect books to all be happy stories with a nicely laid out moral code and traditional hero and villain. If you want to read a very well written novel that deals with real characters, real social problems, and real life then don't hesitate to buy this. If you're expecting fantasy land with a happy ending, stay away, don't buy this, and don't give your negative opinion about something you were destined to dislike.<br /><br />*edit* I forgot to give my thought about all of the \\"excessive profanity\\" and questionable subject matter in this book. To the naysayers- what planet do you live on? Do you honestly think that drug addicts living in the projects are not typically very foul mouthed? Do you not think that drug addiction and rape are real, often times overlooked issues in every community imaginable? I never once thought the subject matter was unnecessary for the story she was trying to tell.

B00A7ZXDLQ|4.0|I used to dislike Rihanna's music so much but 3 albums ago I became a fan and this one is a true body mover. I take her music lightly, some want to dig too deep. She's in her early twenties and her music shows it and that's what I like about it. People expect her to be this role model and what not but she's a young woman in the public's eye and she finally got the balls to stop pleasing the public, either you like the girl or you don't but I love the fact that she is enjoying her younger years because we know so many of these rich celeb kids live a life in the public and are afraid to be them or lash out horribly (Lohan!!) Anywho this album is not the best, not the worst but it has some bangers. My favs are:<br /><br />Phresh Out the Runway- Is too damn fun. Rihanna has a way to make you feel fancy.<br /><br />NUMB- Proves that she is on her own damn thang and me likes it. I am a Eminem fan and although there is backlash on his small cameo on the song, I find it very fitting. I like when features are short and not overbearing. .his was perfect.<br /><br />Loveeeeeeee song ft Future- has me wrapped around its fanger!!! I am not a fan of Future but this right here. .he did perfectly. . .<br /><br />Nobody's Business ft Chris Brown- I thought I'd dislike it but dammit I love it.<br /><br />Stay- Is a very pretty song<br /><br />NO Love Allowed. Hell all the songs are catchy and dancable to.... This is my dancing music. . .

B0095R64AO|1.0|I had been wanted to see this movie for a long time, but was not impressed when I watched it. I found the movie to feel very long and a bit all over the place.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Not a very engaging movie. After about 10-20 minutes I was so uninterested that I started doing other tasks and the movie was mainly background noise. I would look up at certain times and watch for a moment but I then would lose interest, just not a tight script or engaging acting.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|From all of the hype, I expected a kinkier story line. It is an excellent book and am looking forward to the next two books.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I tried to persuade my wife to buy this for her Kindle Fire. She bought something else instead and was very disappointed. I bought this without her knowledge. Once it arrived, I removed the one she bought and replaced it with this one. When she &#34;discovered&#34; the new enclosure, she was thrilled. A perfect fit, protects well, and is slim and compact! Now she recommends to everyone who has a Kindle Fire to get one for themselves!  Update Dec. 2015 Now 4 years after purchase and this cover still looks & feels new! My wife uses her Kindle every day, carries it everywhere, and no signs of wear anywhere. It was well worth the purchase price. Her Kindle is now starting to fail. Too bad it wasn't built with the same quality as the cover!

B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I thought it was a decetn attempt to portray the book, but there were many scenes left out which gave depth to the conflict of emotions felt by Katniss as she moves from survival to protection of Peeta.  I suppose there is only so much time to tell the story, but I felt the action was choppy and did not move well from scene to scene
B0041KVZ18|3.0|This is approximately my seventh purchase of the White Album. I have a pretty good version with minimal scratches of the original. I have a high end setup and am sensitive to sound so I was looking forward to great sound. I started with Birthday and immediately noticed an increase in bass but this also decreased fidelity and sharpness of sound. I thought that my brain was rebelling and not able to accept something new. I then asked my wife to close her eyes and compare as I changed copies on the turntable. In less than 5 seconds she said the second one was much better in sound. The secon one was the original. I still believe this is the greatest album ever made but I cant recommend this new version due to the cloudier sound.

B008ULRY78|4.0|It's a violent, chaotic romp through the seedy underbelly of Indonesia. At first, The premise is simple: an organized crime king pin runs an apartment building that is basically a Holiday Inn for felons and miscreants. The SWAT style team (including our rookie hero) plan on storming the building (one violent, bloody story at a time) until they take down the king pin in the penthouse. But all is not what it seems: back stabbing and old blood ties reveal a more complicated and sinister agenda.<br /><br />The fighting is well-choreographed, and the scenes often play out like a ballistic Swan Lake (without the chuckles). There are some very uncomfortable slicing, dicing mincing and blunt-force trauma thrown in with a variety of crunches and bullets to the melon. Sort of like date-night with Steven Seagal circa 1988. Enjoy!
B00004NKEO|2.0|Let's start with the problem and it is mainly that is a vinyl version of a digital remaster. Nothing wrong with that if it's done well but in this case you really feel it when Iggy POPS you because at most of the key vocal crescendos there are two Pops and one isn't Iggy. This is a great shame as the reproduction of the packaging is superb. It beats me who the vinyl re-issue companies think they're dealing with because I'm sure most of us that buy this stuff have collections that date back in time. I, for instance, have an old copy of the compilation Iggy and the Stooges \\"No Fun\\" released in 1980(?) that has most of these songs on it and some choice cuts from the first album. I cleaned the old album with a SpinClean record cleaner and it plays like new. This new 180 gram version of Fun House was overly Poppy from the off and even though I have put it through the same cleaning process the pops have remained in the same places. I am not an audiophile but someone that looks after their records carefully and loves to play them but unfortunately this one is better to look at than play. I'm pleased vinyl is back but sometimes it makes me wonder if anyone listens to the final product before they unleash it on an unsuspecting public. I've just taken (not so) Funhouse off the turntable and put on the Light in The Attic produced vinyl re-issue of Morphine's \\"Cure For Pain\\" on and the difference is astounding. A lost opportunity and a bit of shame, \\"Fun House\\" deserves better treatment.

B008K5T5AI|1.0|I went to the extraordinary step of acquiring a refund for this ebook.<br /><br />I valiantly (and I stress the word) strove to understand any of what the writer was trying to impart. It made no sense.<br /><br />Maybe it was just too Cultured for me or I just needed to Sublime to get it? Then again it might be living up to my initial `ten pages in' thought. It's drivel!<br /><br />Sorry Ian I just did't get it. As an experiment in convoluted writing it probably works. Just not on me. I got to the halfway mark and gave up. Peter Eerden
B00634GHJA|1.0|I tried everything to get this app to work but it didn't. I followed the instructions on the app's web site several times but it just won't work.

0316228532|1.0|To sum it up, this was a very disappointing book.  Pedantic, boring, adolescent and crude would be kind words for this rambling book.  It does tackle some of the social issues and how country England works to focus on the gnat while swallowing the elephant, but the presentation of the arguments gives you an illness of the soul.  This is just not a good story.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was the best survival/adventure/action book I have ever read it attacks a little slow but it gets in all a gigantic amount better I love the book I would recommend it to anyone with a strong stomach
0525953728|5.0|This was good for several reasons. The topic was an obvious hit, but that's not what made this book so good. In fact, in regards to the UBL shooting, the book shares very little, if anything, that you did not already get from the 60 minutes interview or the many other press accounts if you've been paying attention.<br /><br />However, what made this book so interesting is the humble incite the author shares about their story. Every SEAL book I've read has a degree of self aggrandizement. Some far more than others, and sometimes to the point that some of them are unreadable. This one just tells a story that is very entertaining and interesting way.<br /><br />If you're at all interested in this, you have to read it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Typical Grisham lawyer novel, but with more twists and turns than usual.  Surprise ending. This is Grisham at his best.

B008D28HYS|4.0|I got this as a free download, I would pay 99 cents for it but not more than that, just because there are so many free games available. It is a fun game, it is interesting to see what picture you create, though some are a little odd.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|My favorite Murakami is still the Wind-up Bird Chronicle, but 1984 kept me interested from beginning to end. There are just so few great story teller like Murakami around. Opening the first page of a new novel from him is always a thrill and I thank him for that.

B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I must admit that all I knew of Janelle was her feature on the rock song of the summer. But I coincidentally heard \\"Mushrooms & Roses\\" and I was hooked. This album plays like a compilation, but it's great and it shows the brilliance, musical aptitude and variety of the artist. I would definitely recommend this.
B00A7OFVVM|1.0|I love horror but AHS:A is STUPID. It's like they wanted to throw EVERYTHING relevant to horror and social issues of the time all together in one show. The main character is in an inter-racial marriage and the other main character is a lesbian (big deals back in the 50s/60s). Now throw in alien abduction, human experimentation, a killer who wears human skin, people possessed by Satan, a nun with a secret-- but wait, there's more! NAZIS! How much more crap can they cram into this show. Seriously. I'm waiting for a vampire to show up. Stupid  as hell.

B006LSZECO|4.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" is a story of a wife gone missing, and the search to find her.  It was an entertaining story with elements of suspense.  This is a good book if you are looking for an easy read with a good story line.
0446580848|5.0|As we always expect a Novel by Nelson DeMille will be exquisite. In this story we find a group of dark operatives that do what should be done. Kill the enemy. I also enjoy his thoughts expressed as he works his way through with different Managers, Leaders, Politicians and the Enemy's. He always has things to state that keep you laughing even though reading between the lines we find exactly what is going on in this make believe winning the minds and love of people. He solely shows that these animals have never been conquered and never will. We sacrifice our good young men and women to these fifth century cave dwellers that have no honor to us or their own people. I would suggest anyone that may think we could do any diplomatic projects with these people come to understand one thing that is explained throughout the story. The only thing we win at is giving money to those sworn to kill all of us. This book is a classic. All of us should read it as it may be fiction but its more fact than that.

B009E9QOEO|5.0|This review is of the CD-only set, and is probably redundant: there's already been masses written and said about this album, and if you're looking at it you're almost certainly a Led Zeppelin fan of some sort and you'd want this album even if it wasn't all that good.  Thankfully, it is good.  Very good, in fact.  The three surviving members plus John Bonham's son Jason still had the old magic even in 2007 when this concert took place, and this is a fine record of it.<br /><br />I saw Led Zeppelin play live just once, at Earl's Court in the mid-70s.  It was a great concert which I still remember with huge pleasure.  Unsurprisingly, they have matured since then, but still generate a terrific atmosphere and perform a great set.  Jimmy Page plays superbly and with a little more brevity and concision in his solos than of old, which to me is no bad thing.  John Paul Jones reminds us what a very fine musician he is and Robert Plant still has a fantastic voice which he uses with real maturity.  The power is still there when he needs it but there is a sensitivity and delicacy in places which, while there in Zeppelin's heyday, has matured into something very special.<br /><br />The recorded sound is great, and it's a cracking live album which manages to capture the atmosphere as well as the band's performance, and a fine addition to Led Zeppelin's discography.  Warmly recommended - but then, I bet you already knew you were going to buy it.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Have been a DeMille fan for a long time. This is not his best work. Love John Corey's attitude and am usually entertained by him but this one is slow moving and filled with to much back ground on the  minor characters and the plot was obvious with few surprises.The ending is anticlimactic and leaves you knowing that the CIA guys will return in a future novel. Overall I was looking forward to a new book by DeMille with Corey but this fell short of what we were used to.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very fun to play. you should definitely check it out if you are into playing games with an actual story. good for wasting time, but best enjoyed like the days of nintendo old.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|I actually wanted to watch this movie at the theater when it came out, but I'm glad I ended up waiting to watch it as a rental. It was actually entertaining and well done, but nothing to watch again. An interesting spin on the Snow White story and I liked the new direction, but just not anything that exceeded my expectation. Good watch if you haven't seen it, but wouldn't buy the hard copy. Definitley a good one-time rental.

No need to install drivers manually.<br /><br />Once detected, your port is automatically created: COM3, COM4, etc.<br /><br />The only downside of this is, the cable is really short. You might need an extension. I also needed to buy a Male/Female converter because of the screws as mentioned in the description. Careful, they mention Female/Female but you most likely need a Male/Female.

0345803485|1.0|I am not kidding. Another reviewer checked to see if the author was a 16 yr. old. When I read this, I looked up publishing date..sure enough published in 2011 and a 21 yr. old college student is thrilled at receiving email. Hint...young people are not only not blown away by email, they don't even email anymore...they text. I believe the word text was mentioned five times...but email filled pages ( and the least clever emails possible). Also, this billionaire has a black berry , again in 2011. Unbelievable.<br /><br />The sex is boring, the heroine is dull and the writing is beyond repetitious. Yes, the other reviewer was correct..she orgasms at the drop of a hat yet she's a 21 yr. old virgin...a college student who doesn't even own a computer or cell phone.<br /><br />Quite possibly, the worse book I've read-ever. If there were Raspberry Awards for books as well as horrible movies, this would win.
B009P5S11G|5.0|This album is worth every penny... the song are AMAZING and its a good mix of R&B, Pop and it even has some throwbacks that remind you of Michael Jackson. This is one of here BEST albums yet. she out so much effort and time and it for sure paid of. This is a HIT.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book will probably help some readers affirm their faith and find comfort in the story as I did, others not so much.  But it should generate discussion. It is not the usual near death experience story.  I recommend it as a good read.
B004TEYD60|3.0|UBIK, ISBN 9780547572291, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, First Mariner Books Edition by P. K. Dick has been reviewed many times and seems to offer an appeal to a certain type of reader.<br />This story is set in a futuristic period where a group of individuals with anti-psychic powers are needed to control the activities of those who have the psychic powers. An attack upon the group sets in motion a regressive, degenerative reaction.<br />It is my understanding that the book was written during a period when the author, a well-known Sci-fi author, was using amphetamines. For this reader, this explains the interesting and unusual plot that seems to lack structure and is peopled by characters that have been both poorly developed and handled in their inter- relationships. I should not recommend this book for other than the person who doesn't mind this lack of character development and a `way-out' plot that `wanders loosely about'. Reviewed by John H. Manhold, award winning fiction/non-fiction author.

0525423656|4.0|In the last book Cassia learned that the perfect Society in which she lives isn't as perfect as she thought and that there are some things worth fighting for, now she is trying to fixed the great mistake she made by going to the Outer Providences to find Ky.<br />She will not only have to keep her mind in her current mission she will also be faced with the devastating reality that is to live outside the Society and find a way to stay alive in the middle of a war where every single soldier is sent there and never expected to return alive.<br /><br />For this book I liked the two voice dynamic, we get to know Cassia and Ky better, specially Ky. It was a book I couldn't put down, but it did get a little confusing from time to time for it was hard to remember at times who was I reading Ky or Cassia.<br />This story was more about getting to know what makes our characters tick and get to know more of the Society from the outside, If asked I would say that the first book is better because in Matched there was this emotional connection with Cassia that I didn't really feel in Crossed. But my respect for the characters increases for the trails and decisions they have to make and my need to know what they must face and do next grows with each chapter read.<br />I wish there was more I could say with out feeling like I'm giving away some stuff and spoiling it all for you guys. But this is a good sequel and I just can't wait to see how this trilogy ends.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|Earlier this year, Lana gave us the gift of Born to Die, which was somewhat somber, yet somewhat philosophical. And now she gives us Paradise, which lives up to Born to Die, yet in a new way. I wasn't sure what to make of this the first time I listened through it. Ride had been on repeat for weeks on end on my iPod, but I was hoping the rest of the songs would live up to it. And they did! They are interesting and a little bit more variational in their themes than those on Born to Die. Here's a breakdown, at least for me.<br />Ride- 5/5 There is no question that this was probably the best song to choose as a single. Stands out to me as one of her best songs.<br />American- 5/5 This is a song that, like the rest of the reviewers on here have said, embodies Lana's typical patriotic theme. But it's beautifully done in terms of the music and is nice to listen to.<br />Cola- 5/5 With its controversial lyrics, this song does stand out. It is fun, though, and once again, the music for this is beautifully done. I have to say it's one of my favorites from the EP, if only for its controversial nature.<br />Body Electric- 6/5 There is something about this song that is mesmerizing to me. It's so beautiful and very interesting.<br />Blue Velvet- 5/5 This is just a well-done cover. Very fitting for Lana.<br />Gods and Monsters- 5/5 This is yet another of my favorites. It's an interesting perspective to take and a great allegory.<br />Yayo- 4/5 This song does somehow fall short for me, just because it is a little long and isn't one of my favorites melodically or musically.<br />Bel Air- 5/5 This is a beautiful song that sort of floats in the air. Great way to end the EP.<br />There are several editions out there . I have the Target one, which comes with two remixes of Blue Velvet, which are both worth a listen or two, though not stunning. Overall, though, this EP is absolutely amazing and lives up to Born to Die. Highly recommended!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is impossible to put down and so fun. The music keeps you in a sort of meditation mode and it's a great way to unwind. Totally worth buying!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|When I bought this book, I really wasn't sure if I would like it but after the first chapter I was hooked! If you have a chance to read this book, do it!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I played this game on a friends kindle, and was amazed by the entertainment value of the game. I decided to get it for myself. But for some reason, it always fails downloading it. I tried a total of 8 times. Once I'm able to download it, I'll give it 5 stars.<br />*Edit* I downloaded it, but there's very few levels. 4 Stars.
B00684J49U|5.0|I'm addicted to this series-it's worth buying the DVDs to watch as many ad-free episodes at a time as I want!

1451695195|5.0|This book was highly recommended to me by a dear friend...as she knows of the near death experience Ai had in my 20's.  I found this to be an amazing, life affirming book. His description of the afterlife was so detailed and clear.  The fact that he kept calling it so &#34;real&#34; was just the word that I had been searching for.  It is a beautiful feeling to have such a clear feeling of the wonder of the life after this world.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I would recomend this album to anyone who apprecites the singer song writter, Taylor one of the most talanted 22 year old's that comes to mind. There is alot of growth shown in this album, a creative person who is able put the whole package togeather.It an instant favoriate, no foul or explicit languange just great music.There is a great sence of<br />hearing the chapters of someone's sketch book....or Taylor's observations sketched with words and notes... it's a great harmony of her words and reality melded togeather with modern music production.
0385344333|2.0|*possible spoilers*<br />Like many people I was disappointed by the last book (The Affair). The good news is, A Wanted Man is about 10 times better than The Affair. The bad news: it's still not very good.<br />This book did not have any compelling characters. The plot was thin. There was no tension. Half of the book is watching people laboriously figure out stuff that the reader already knows. Like other reviewers have pointed out, some things came dangerously close to space-fillers. Conversations were repeated and analyzed over and over. Towards the end, Reacher is going to rescue someone, but this person (although 'a good guy') we have no connection with from any earlier scenes. There is no awesome villain like that guy with a hook for a hand (Hook Hobie?). There are just random henchmen that Reacher mows down. There was some pathos where Reacher is trying to get a ride hitch-hiking. And a few funny scenes with the motel owner. But overall the book was just not very good. There was a weak attempt to have a 'riddle' that is 'solved' at the end, but I thought is was pretty lame. Reacher is constantly spitting out irrelevant facts about different states in the Union that would get anyone else slapped. And one of the 'pivotal' scenes is literally the terrorists forget to throw away a McDonald's receipt, and then they use a GPS to find the address. I felt like there were little flashes of what could be a good book, but it just kind of crumbled into nothing.<br />I paid full-price for this book new and considering how much I loved the earlier Reacher novels, I was happy to spend it. But I really do hope that they get better. It may not be his fault since I've read he is contracted to write one a year, and that's not how good books are written.<br /><br />Must add as well, Reacher's explanation of banking at the end is an insult to readers: \\"Ya know, folks, they don't just keep all that money in the bank stacked up waiting for you to withdraw it.\\" Honestly, Reacher??
B005LAII94|5.0|One of Oliver Stone's very best, a post-modernist approach all the way, and therefore way over the heads of the Neaderthals who booed it with one star or two and used the word \\"boring\\" for criticism.<br /><br />Violent, disturbing, gripping, \\"Savages\\" focuses on a savage woman as leader and destroyer, and her victim as a woman who might just double for anything.<br /><br />The two male leads are, in the film, gay, and this put many viewers off, as their homophobia ran through them with the added help, no doubt, of the presence of John Travolta, once loved, and now hated for being gay.<br /><br />The endings are startling. This film has found an audience and will find more, but not in America as it finds itself today. It wants and needs \\"Twilight.\\"
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I chose this product because I had to. The old one desentagrated into little tiny pieces like it just dry rotted and the wire frayed. It was too dangerous to not replace. I shouldn't have had to replace it so soon as it was only a few years old.
0141197307|4.0|Bought as a collector item with all the recent hype between the 2012 collaboration with Loius Vuitton and Kusama - much cheaper than a purse!<br />Illustrations are bright and colorful and the cloth-like book cover is really attractive.
B001992NUQ|5.0|If you ever read the book by Chuck Pahlniuk you would LOVE this movie. While the novel is more detailed, hollywood didnt change up the story very much to make it into a film. The characters were perfectly portrayed by the actors, and the look of the film fits well with the gritty nature of the story. 5 stars!
B00005JMUA|5.0|I got my order quickly.  Really enjoyed the movie.  I love Quentin Tarrantino movies........Uma Thurman was amazing in the movie.
B006XBSC8C|5.0|it is so awesome because on the one that got away has the acoustic version and it without it but i wish there was more pictures and i wish that it did say  a bad word in one of the songs and they shoud have bleaped but i didnt get it from amazon so amazon might have bleaped
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I think every body will love this app you get to draw pictures of what ever u pick out of three choices then you draw it and press send and also you can chat with people too and you can talk to people all around the world Nd its a fun game to play with your friends too so, and its fun for any age
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is super for people who love to read. You can keep it stored in reading it.In my opinion the recommend is excellent, I really like the enjoy. Could give you the opportunity to have her on your android.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Both of the Kill Bill movies were awesome.  Really enjoyed both.  Uma Thurman was just incredible in both.  They were great.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I enjoyed the gag reel as a bonus feature! I always do! I saw the movie twice in the theater, so enjoying the movie at home now as well!
B0041D843M|5.0|I found this book very impressive.  It is thorough and the arguments are supported by top notch scientific research.  The only downside is that the information is so compelling that I'll have to make significant changes to my diet now that I've read the book!
B008458O3S|5.0|The main game is over too soon, but the bonus levels are absolutely diabolical. This is a great game if you enjoy thinking.
B000P0J024|5.0|Thourghly enjoyed the CD's and DVD, I had seen the video before and loved it so wanted the CD to listen to.
0765316994|2.0|Redshirts stared out fun, but digressed into something unbelievable.  I couldn't finish the coda's.  I inhaled the Old Man's War trilogy, and am a Scalzi fan, but this was disappointing.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|easy, fun, social, good way to pass the time.<br /><br />loved the original, this one does the brand justice.<br /><br />thanks for the fun.
B0073U2FB2|2.0|I like B-movies, I like Sci-Fi B-movies and I even generally like the not-so-good Sci-Fi B-movies (I actually rated \\"Skyline\\" three stars) - but this thing was too much even for me. As one of the precedent reviewers very accurately noticed, this is basically a perfectly useless and less succesful remake of \\"Skyline\\", just with a lesser budget and without US Air Force vs. alien bionic fighters moments. This review contains limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />The general idea of the film was pretty good - let's throw a handful of young Americans in the middle of an alien invasion, but instead of an US location (New York, Los Angeles, Hawaii, as those are the places usually invaded by extraterrestrial villains) let's place them in Moscow! It could have been such a great and full of humor film, but the whole idea was COMPLETELY wasted by the archi-idiotic scenario. Do not expect any humor or smart dialogs and the very limited action scenes are pathetic. Every time anybody seems to have a potential to do or say something interesting he/she is immediately eradicated.<br /><br />The reasons for which I still give this film two stars, are following:<br /><br />- there is aproximately 10-12 minutes which are watchable - but just so we are clear it is BEFORE the alien invasion begins...<br />- even if all actors were completely unknown to me and even if after watching their \\"performance\\" I believe they should remain so, all the girls were still very cute...<br />- there is one smart one-liner at the very beginning and another one at the very end of the film<br />- this is the first Sci-Fi film ever in which I saw humans engage alien invaders with cavalry and Molotov cocktails made from vodka...)))<br />- last but not least, there is a kind of an \\"alternate geography\\" lesson in this film (it concerns the Moskova river) which made me laugh like a hysterically drunk hyena - although I am certain that such was not the intention of the scenarist...<br /><br />So all in all, this film is a huge failure, only watchable if we consider it as a kind of stupid joke - but it will work only after ingestion of a huge quantity of beer. Otherwise, avoid it if possible...a huge failure, only watchable if we consider it as a kind of stupid joke - but it will work only after ingestion of a huge quantity of beer.

B0086700CM|1.0|the fact that i cannot purchase this app because i do not live in the US is more than enough cause to hate this app! amazon should cater for people who purchase kindkle fire from other countries! if not then only sell it to americans!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book did the trick. A hard job made easy. I'm now published in Kindle. Check it out, [[ASIN:B00A2WS4X6 When Grandpa Was a Kid]]
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|Bought it wanting to see what it's about and it's terrible. FX has never produced a lot of high quality programming, but this is filth. If the intent was to make the viewer uncomfortable not in a scared way, but in a dirty way...job done.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This was a required reading for my son.  He was shocked to find out how &#34;mean&#34; Jobs was to his employees.
B003SFRBQ0|5.0|I love Lady Antebellum and this song in particular. I will recommend it to others and purchase more Lady Antebellum in the furture.
B002RTMXIY|5.0|For my taste this is one of the best sci fi movies.  The actors are at their best.  I was told that this is based on a real experience. I would love to know what happened to the real participants. I HIGHLY recommend this movie.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|\\"I could've put you in the deepest, darkest hole, but I kept you out because I knew that one day would come when you were gonna pay me back -and today's that day.\\" The best of the best is back. The expendable crew led by Barney Ross (Stallone) is once again blowing stuff up, killing people and saving the innocent. When one of their jobs ends up with a crew member being killed the mission turns from a rescue to revenge. This is one crew you don't want on your bad side. I will admit that I did like the first movie and watched it twice but that was all I needed for that one. This one I had lower expectations for so that may have helped but I liked this one more then the first. There is a plot to this but in a movie like this one it doesn't really matter. It has all you want in this...tons of action, everything blowing up, big guns and Chuck Norris...what else can you ask for? Overall, I liked it better then the first one so if you liked that one you will love this one. Very entertaining. I give it a B+.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|My youngest son is a huge reader....always trying to find something for him to read.  Found it....he loved it..a lot!
1451620829|4.0|Firstly, its a great read, a great book.<br />After reading it I realised  that Gene and Paul really did rip Peter off big time. Especially the unplugged and the Aerosmith tour, just played him.<br />Doc McGee is a bastard. So are Gene and Paul, guys I used to admire. There goes my decision to see them on their latest tour.<br />Can't wait for Paul Stanley's book to get his version.
B004HWKWL4|5.0|This is a book everyone should read.  It opens your eyes to whats important in life. It gives you a much needed understanding of our roles and our next life.
0307951529|2.0|This book is O.K. It really isn't spectacular by any stretch, and I was continuously thinking to myself while reading, \\"when is this really going to get good?\\" It's really just a collection of SUPER short stories and some basic advice.  The individual stories are not taken into detail, and neither is the advice.  I swear, this guy was just itching to put together a book.  I can't believe all the rave that's come of it.  He got to sit and read well over a thousand 'applications' of people dying to be written about.  He could of really dug deep, picked a collection of maybe 10 stories, and made examples of each business and then carry that momentum into his advice to drive it home. Instead, he just basically jam packed 'Jim is a ski bum and teaches people how to snowboard and ski online for money.''Mark bought a bunch of mattresses off his buddy and bought a car dealership to sell them out of.''Katie runs a knitting store in Oregon and has a website online.' together and thought that was good enough. There are a few good stories in here, but quite honestly I don't think I found any I was really overly impressed with. Maybe the map people - that's it. THERE IS HARDLY ANY EXAMPLES OF STARTUPS THAT WERE STARTED FOR UNDER $100, and most are secretly just regular, normal small businesses disgusted as cheap start ups.  This book is literally just a complete mess.  It does have some sort of organization, but in my opinion it's done very poorly.  I didn't learn a thing from this book.  This book reminds me of the movie Limitless in this sense: he had a great idea and a great plan.  It's too bad that the end result isn't always what we had hoped it would be.<br /><br />If this review didn't drive you crazy, then it'll be a good read for you.<br />If you found yourself getting angry at the bouncing and lack of fluidity, then move on.  Might I recommend The Power of Habit?  That's an awesome book!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is one of my favorite app. I use it daily. I listen to all sorts of music from all over the world. All you need to do is to plug in the type of music, talk show etc.. and it finds the stations to listen to.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this is one of those games that get you hooked, but you're always running out of coins at the crusual moment, and have to wait for them to regenerate.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|kept me entertained; and story was interesting. wished it had more puzzles though. loved the helpful sparkles. and the music isn't to bad.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I ordered this because everyone was talking about it. I find this book disturbing.  If you like Harlequin romance books and S&M you will like this book. Too much weird sexual details for me.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Good flick....good acting, and nice story with some excitement along the way, that keeps you guessing a lot through the film. I liked it. Still shows how slimy most lawyers are though.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wow I couldn't put it down I was reading the end and walking to the kitchen lol. I nearly ran into the table!!!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's a lot of fun. I really like Mahjong and there are so many different kinds. The symbols seem to be all the same on all of these games.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This cover is lightweight and protects my Kindle.  The stand works well.  It is just what I wanted and at the right price.
B00112GVFO|3.0|Just a wild film of tons of things that simply can't happen, or anywhere close to it, but for kids it's just a fun diversion from reality. Not great acting, and especially by Cruz who adds very little to the film and I had hoped she would. Wonderful filming and sets as well.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|The game itself really isn't bad. HOWEVER,there are so many ads that it was too frustrating to play! I understand that 'free' means you get ads; but this is overboard!
0307960471|5.0|Harry Hole returns--scarred, almost unrecognizable, but still relentlessly pursuing evil. Besides the phantom-like villain Harry chases, he simultaneously battles the demons he always carries within himself. How can he save those he loves from both?
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game!<br /><br />a no brainer game that is very addictive. perfect for killing time while waiting in line! get this game.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is good at first then. you run out of things to do and buy.<br />you need to add more options to keep it interesting.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The game is pretty and mostly easy to navigate. The hint button is actually useful, and it doesn't discharge if it gives less useful information, such as to turn around or to close a window. It recharges reasonably quickly when it needs to. Note that there are some seriously spooky moments, so it may not be suitable for young kids, assuming they'd be able to figure it all out. The map usually gives useful info, so you may want to consult it frequently.<br /><br />MOST HIGHLY recommended!
B00A2LOAKI|1.0|As a small business owner (yes Obama, I did build that), I run a mobile movie theather from my van for kids with a personal touch. Dress up, face painting, role playing, massages and free candy. Although my van does not have the best gas mileage, I still feel that the oportunity for the service offesets the actual cost. Having a target audience helps me specialize in the movies that I try to cater, maintain and bring in new patrons. I have access to most movies before they actually arrive for sale on the mass market and sometimes, at the theaters. This is due in part  to a local vendor I frequent that has some international connections. To keep things legit, I would say that I do not ask too many questions, but his English is pretty minimal so things are easier left unsaid.<br />After viewing the movie, I honestly can not say that I am impressed.<br />Yes, the book is revered as sacred Batman AND comic book canon, but that simply does not cut it for me.<br />Granted, I have never read the source material that it was based off since I am not a fan of the sloppy, artwork of heavyset people.<br />Sure, people will rave on how wonderful the book is, how it redefined the genre and influenced so many other great works. To be honest, that is something that came out twenty-five-plus years ago and this review is not about that book. In fact, there are umpteen something reviews on that book that somehow, each author believes is the most definitive review.<br />Rather, this review is about the movie.<br />The shoddy animation and pretentious and blatantly amateurish voice work in what assumes itself to be a masterpiece. That assumption is clearly limited to the confinines of the imagination found with those involved it's realization. I found myself bored and almost annoyed at what comes across to me as unoriginal poorman's work riding on the coattails in what they thought was great.<br />Likely, WB will continue to milk this raddish by combining the two movies in some special edition with more self-serving background features that would make the likes of Peter Jackson jealous.<br />I will go ahead and show this movie from my van, but I doubt I will keep it for very long since it takes up precious space for bigger movers like \\"Santa Paws 2.\\"edition with more self-serving background features that would make the likes of Peter Jackson jealous.<br />I will go ahead and show this movie from my van, but I doubt I will keep it for very long since it takes up precious space for bigger movers like \\"Santa Paws 2.\\"
B00170MYIS|1.0|Have purchased the third of these Sony NP-SG1 Lithioum Batteries 2 from Amazon & 1 from Walmart when the OE died in my camera and I had to have one on vacation. Same experience wit all of them. Short use time and not real quick to re-charge. As you can see from shopping, you can buy a new camera for what this many batteries cost and the new camera may not eat batteries like the sony does, or perhaps the other brands offer a better quality battery than this one for their cameras. This item is a major POS. I think I might as well buy a no name as waste any more money on these Sony batteries. If I could rate it a minus that would be my rating of this particular battery.
B00650SSDU|2.0|This movie was just so dull and boring. The only scene I liked was the flash mob scene. Neither one of these actors could pull it off, and they don't have chemistry. Big thumbs down on this one.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I order this and got it in the time frame I was given, I have yet to watch it, but it was brand new so I'm sure its in perfect shape!
0307592731|1.0|I can't believe spent $12.99 on this book.  I can't finish it.  It is beyond boring and repetitive.  I am about 67% finished and can't keep going.  I don't even care what happens to her.  Don't waste your time or money.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This was recommended by a few coworkers but I delayed getting it til my network drive crashed.<br />This has helped with that loss as I can keep notes and even excel files it it and access from 4 different devices (the network drive was only accessible from 2).<br /><br />It's easy to use and useful.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|After fully charging my Droid RAZR Maxx HD the notification bar shows 00 and the desktop widget shows -2183% as the battery percentage. Opening from the widget shows a better level of 00%. Opening from the notification bar seems to reset it and everything is fine from there. Also, when running the calibration that seems to lose the WiFi connection. I have to turn off WiFi and turn it back on in order to continue the test. Other than that I find it a very useful app that provides seemingly accurate information.
B009P5S11G|1.0|I love Rihanna's music but she needs to stop smoking the ganja and fully concentrate on her music. She barely sings on most of the songs and they are not up to par with her previous music. Better luck next time.
3937406328|5.0|Great music, every CD was worth it. It is amazing that someone could make an album comprising 11 CDs, truly creative. Must add the packing was very good and seller had taken absolute care and the album reached me in good time. Seller recommended.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|At core, this flick is simply a multi-million dollar format to display Emily Blunt's screen appeal, just as films used to be made just to get Audrey Hepburn in front of a willing audience. Men fall all over themselves in this film to be part of Blunt's life, as if her beauty is all any man needs. She says and does nothing in this production to warrant a man's fancy - no fantastic song and dance routine (Barbara Streisand in \\"Funny Girl\\"; no sterling comedic talent (Goldie Hawn in \\"Foul Play\\"). According to this film's producers, Blunt just has to be. What bologna. The only extraordinary thing about Blunt's character, Harriet, in this film is she represents a Yemeni sheikh who has an extraordinary idea, and somehow Harriet is supposed to share credit for that. As if I had been present when Edison invented the light bulb, I get credit for that achievement.<br /><br />The hypocrisy I refer to in title of my review is CBS Films producing a movie in which a \\"big oil\\" man, and a religious one, is portrayed favorably. CBS Films is a subsidiary of CBS Corp. which willingly allows it's identity to be shaped by it's news organization. That news organization has, for a generation or more, been extremely hostile to \\"big oil\\" and Christian faith. Yet CBS Corp. has no problem portraying a deeply religious \\"big oil\\" man from Yemeni as wise, compassionate, and visionary. This, of course, because it's only big American oil that's evil, and only Christianity that's a farce, not sacred (and politically correct) Islam.
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|What can I say? This DVD is my favorite of the fashion DVD's and Anna Wintour is one of my favorite people around...she knows her business and is frequently misunderstood or disliked for her personal demeanor...I can personally relate to her!
B007UXSPK2|2.0|The Mission Impossible movie franchise isn't fresh anymore. The first two movies were great but the follow up films are just old and tired and boring.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|All of Jo Nesbo's books are great.  You can always count on interesting characters and great story lines. Can't wait to read the next in line.
1878424114|5.0|I bought this for a gift but ended up reading it myself. This guy is really neat. He teaches softly, but deeply. His messages are very important if you are having trouble dealing with life, or if you are sick. This is a quick healing book
0316228532|1.0|So very sadly, I was completely revolted by this book before I had gotten through the first 50 pages. I quit reading it, and I rarely - if ever - do that with a book. Leafing through it just to see if I might be able to give it a second chance, I discovered that it's absolutely loaded with vulgar imagery, crude language (the f-bomb is dropped about every other word) and graphic descriptions of sex fantasies and scenes, and drug use. Rowling seems to believe that she can prove herself a worthy adult author by acting like a teenager that's trying to be adult by using naughty words and talking about sex. It's crude, coarse, boorish, and ultimately - BORING. The characters are under-developed, unlikeable, and completely flat. A huge disappointment from one of my long-time favorite authors. I think Rowling's strength is really as a children's author. She should stick to it.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I like the conflict between protagonists. The story is interesting but I wish they'd have just skipped this crummy antagonist and gone with something more interesting. Oh noes, invading robots, yawn.
B003S897UK|3.0|Haven seen Gov't Mule live, this recording doesn't do them justice as the recording sounds washed out with some of the dynamic range and mid freq's missing. All Gov't Mule is a treat to listen but I'd pass this one up for another of their live performances to capture what a jam band should really sound like.
B00A3OH8EY|1.0|I am a HUGE fan of AHS season 1 and it is with sadness I can't say the same about Asylum.  When I realized what the creators were going to do with each season, I thought it was risky but brilliant.  I loved the idea; so I waited with anticipation for Asylum to start...they even have the actor from Babe...well know and uber talented added to the cast this year.  Zachary Quinto and Jessica Lange and Evan Peters back...I was SO stoked...then I watched it.  I tried, tried SO hard to love it like I did season one...but I just can't.  It isn't that there is too much going on...I don't like torture porn.  I find it trite and unnecessary.  So for those reasons I am out.  Here's hoping season 3, if there is one, is more along the lines of true horror instead of just horrific.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! it makes growing pinterest really easy and fun. simple to use. I'm very happy that I downloaded it
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I had to watch it a couple times because I kept falling asleep through it. Suspension of disbelief can only go so far and this is just beyond that periphery. It's a very very weak story.
B008C40218|5.0|I've been a Calexico fan since Hot Rail wowed me more than a decade ago. But until Algiers the albums in between didn't quite live up to what I was hoping for. This new album more than makes up for those disappointments. Brooding, exciting, inventive, real and occasionally way deep, Algiers is a beautiful testament to the possibilities of music not wedded to re-hashing youthful themes or easy pop structures. It's a transport for grownups and, if you allow it to be, a dozen doorways opening. The last and least flamboyant of the lot, \\"The Vanishing Mind,\\" holds its own alongside anything Patti Smith and Leonard Cohen have produced. In my world, no higher praise is possible.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Ok, so what is there to really say about this movie series besides how much my wife loves it.  And Blue Ray is so much better looking.
B004UID2LC|4.0|You don't have to buy music with this app. you just long press and download as MP3 and it will be played as music! the only thing is its a little slow and sometimes the same picture goes for all the music u downloaded. but its FREE MUSIC!!!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|This is an ok movie, but it is nowhere near as good as the Japanese original. Having seen Battle Royale first, I can see where Hollywood chopped up the story to make it more &#34;acceptable&#34; to American consumers (but they were wrong).
B000W298P4|5.0|This is simply one of the best albums by one of the best artists ever. I just adore everything about this album!!!
B007KUFDBY|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite and one of Disney's most underrated movie. Treasure Planet is amazing! The crisp Blu-Ray quality makes me feel that it is an entirely different movie. I love all the added extra features and it was nice to have the DVD copy thrown in too (even though i don't think i have a need for it :p ) This is a great money and it money spent well
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest was my first purchase using my Kindle and I was not disappointed.  The Millenium Trilogy is an outstanding read.  The characters of Mikael Blomqvist and Lisbeth Salander are well developed and the action and suspense drive this book to a very satisfying conclusion.  The translation of this book into English is tremendous, often translations seem stilted but after reading this book it is hard to believe it was not written in English. The only disappointment is that there are no other books to further document the adventures of these characters.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book showed a side of Steve Jobs that was mostly a secret until now.  I thoroughly enjoyed every word.  Good job.

B002NWXRYY|5.0|I love to watch this movie just to see the house.  It is it's own character, instrumental in separating Steve Martin from his long time love, &#34;Becky&#34; who thinks he's crazy for proposing to her with a house instead of a ring, but then in bringing him together with Goldie Hawn, who is always reinventing herself and can't believe a woman like Becky would reject a man who would build her a house.  And though Steve and Goldie both plot to get what they want, despite their shenanigans, the house has plans of it's own, eventually bringing Steve the promotion he needs and Goldie the love she deserves.
0385342063|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has proven once again why she's one of the best writers in chick-lit/women's fiction. The less I say about how great this book is, the more mature and adult like I'll sound. Amazing, stupendous! I was so intrigued by the story that I read it from cover to cover in two hours. That's a record, even for me! I really wanted to know what was going to happen to Poppy and what was going on with Sam and his company.<br /><br />Trust me, if you haven't already read this, or picked it up, do it! You won't regret it, especially if you've ever read anything by Sophie Kinsella before.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Mumford & Sons truly never disappoint.  This album has been on repeat for over a week now.  Definitely one of my go to albums!

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. I could not put the book down with the constant action and drama. It is well worth it for the book.
0425263916|5.0|Just when I think Sylvia Day can't out do herself she does. Her Crossfire series far surpasses anything I've ever read written by her before. Reflected In You picks up exactly where Bared To You left off. Eva and Gideon are still learning about each other and about their relationship. There are people from both their pasts who pop up. Gideon's secret is revealed and I must say it is as heart breaking as Eva's. This book wrenched my emotions as much if not more than Bared To You. I have no idea how I am going to make it until May to read what is supposed to be the last book in this trilogy and series and I can only wonder what Ms. Day has in store for Eva and Gideon.<br /><br />Even if erotic romance is not your cup of tea, this book has so much more to offer. Please don't overlook it because of that.
B005I2KDR0|5.0|I've wanted a citizen eco drive skyhawk but they are so expensive so I decided I'd do this one instead.  This E-6B Flight Computer is easy to use.  Alarm keeps 2nd time zone (like GMT).  The solar part threw me off a little when the watch arrived.  I thought it didn't work.  I wore it around for two days to charge it (the time wasn't very accurate).  But now that it's charged, it's working like a champ!  I was also worried it was going to be too large, but for what it does, it doesn't feel too bulky.  I've also gotten a lot of compliments on the watch.  Really happy I made this purchase.
B004Y12S9W|4.0|Its expensive ,but pretty use full<br /><br />I used a lot and easy to use to connect with lab top and connect with tv and watch all kind off program and connect with IPad also thanks
1416955070|4.0|If you have ever been on Goodreads, then you have, without a doubt, heard of The City of Bones.<br />There is so much hype around this \\"trilogy\\" especially with the movie coming out in 2013...<br />I say \\"trilogy\\" because I have heard several, several times that this was originally a trilogy but there are now about 6 books in all.<br /><br />On to the review:<br />Clary Fray and her best friend, Simon, are headed to Pandemonium. Little does she know that nothing will ever the the same after that day. She witnesses a murder, and to make matters worse, she is the only one that saw it. What happens the following morning is much worse. She gets a frightening call from her mother, Jocelyne Fray. She rushes back home and finds it empty. Empty of humans, at least. There is a demon in her house. She ends up being attacked and is thrust into a dangerous world she knows nothing about. Or does she?<br /><br />Well, many (almost all) of the reviews I've read have mentioned that this is a Harry Potter rip-off.<br />Let me just say, I love the HP series with every fiber of my being. I wil defend Harry Potter until the day I die and I am not ashamed to admit that. Not in the least bit.<br /><br />Having owned the books and dvd's, I can tell you that I know the story backwards and forwards. AND IT DIDN'T AFFECT MY OPINION OF THE CITY OF BONES, AT ALL.<br /><br />Yes, they have similarities, but they can be easily overlooked, at least in my opinion. There are so many books that have been published. Do people honestly think that no two books have anything in common?<br />No book is completely original. At least not any I've read lately.<br /><br />The biggest argument that I read is that Valentine is Voldemort. The first person that came to my mind when I read everything Valentine had done was not Voldemort, it was Hitler. Didn't Hitler also try to get rid of the people that didn't fit his image of the \\"perfect race\\"? Why then, is the only thing that people can think of is Voldemort?!<br /><br />I'll tell you why. Because those of us that grew up with Harry Potter are still devastated that that part of our lives has now ended. I understand that some, if not most, won't like anything that comes off as a  \\"rip-off\\" because nothing will ever compare to HP. Ever.<br /><br />The way I see it, though, what's done is done. Harry Potter was a huge success. Directors and writers saw how successful that series was and how much money they made from it and they are all looking for the \\"next big thing\\". And along came Ms. Claire.<br /><br />Can you blame them?!<br /><br />To sum everything up: yes there were some similarities here and there, but it was still a fun, enjoyable read.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I just finished Steven Erikson and wanted a read just as detailed and thrilling. I stumbled around a bit, but finally decided to give Joe Abercrombie a try and am very glad I did. The story is just as involved and the characters are so realistic. You never know where its going to go next. I will defintely be reading the rest of his books now.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Even though I came into this series in the middle I think it one of the best out. The mix of old and new is truly inspired.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Totally winning addition to the oddball collection of Wes Anderson films, each of which hits the bullseye in exotic ways.  Very much like prime Robert Altman, his films seems to wallow in  oddball collections of wacky characters with sometimes overly familiar actors doing dazzlingly unconventional work bringing them to life.  This is story of a pre-adolescent nerd doing a wildly romantic thing, kidnapping a young girl and running off to escape a hostile world. It is totally absurd, and is played, very much from the viewpoint of his character's warped pubescent  viewpoint.  His actions cause a major upheaval in the 1960s scout camp environment. Everyone is in dead earnest to get things back to normalcy. Edward Norton is his immediate scoutmaster, Bruce Willis is a cop trying to communicate with him, and Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are his parents. And Harvey Keitel, in an unbilled cameo, is the grand poo-bah of scout camps. Each of them are completely delightful in their roles, unlike any of their previous appearances in other films. A one-of -a-kind.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love the continuous play and want to see how high I can get on levels.  It is fun to compete against my friends and family.

1582701709|5.0|Everyday I struggled about just going thru the motions and complained about everything. I would hear everyone around me that I should just stop being so negative but this book taught me so much about focusing on the positive things in my life. This book is a complimentary book to the greatest book of all, the Bible.

0887307280|5.0|Great read for any small business owner or if you're thinking about owning a small business. It is one of those must read books that is recommended by just about every business owner.
B008UTV6S8|4.0|I have to agree with a previous reviewer in that this 2CD/DVD package is something that all true Paul Simon fans will want to have. It is a very enjoyable concert, even though it is a little on the clumsily edited side. But why not include the whole concert? Surely there was room for at least another half hour of music. Maybe it's because I'm a bit of a completist, but I'd rather have seen the whole concert come out. Nice to know I'm not alone in feeling that way.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I purchased the app then clicked to install and an error keeps popping up saying there was an error during install. I have downloaded several other apps so the malfunction is most certainly in this application. I have the same game on my phone and it is a great game but I am not impressed with Amazon's inability to provide the game as expected.
B004PIKPTY|5.0|Purchased this headset for my son, after 2 months it had a short somewhere and would lose connection. Could not return to Amazon so followed the warranty from Thermaltake and they sent a brand new one.<br /><br />Will definatley purchase from them again.  A company is only as good as their return policy. It's nice to find a company that actually stands behind their product.
B005LAIGNC|4.0|I liked it.  Actually, I really, really liked 'Red Tails.'  I didn't know what to expect after reading the initial reviews following its theatrical release.  But then again, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls seemed to take an unfair critical drubbing, and I enjoyed that movie quite a lot (flaws and all). -- Red Tails is a war picture in the grand old tradition of war pictures.  I could easily see four clones of John Wayne starring in this movie (with a few Lee Marvins thrown in for good measure).  It is cleanly made and the two hours go by before you know it.  The aerial action is exciting and strangely reminiscent of the final space battles in both Revenge of the Sith and Attack of the Clones.  But as George Lucas financed this film himself (thank you, George) and had a hand in designing the aerial action, it is no surprise. -- Some criticism has been levelled at the film for not making more somber weight of the fact that the Tuskeegee airman were actual pilots and that they battled racism at just about every turn as they flew their way into history.  To some degree I guess I could agree with that, but the next time you watch Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra or Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments, let me know how much is historical accuracy and how much is up on the screen for sheer entertainment.  Red Tails is, almost throughout, a thrilling movie.  The four leads are very good in their roles (I can't remember the actors' names, but they play Joker, Easy, Lightning and Ray Gun ... all good characters).  Terrance Howard is especially awesome as Colonel Bullard, the man who fights racism in Washington while the pilots fight it in Europe.  In fact, all concerned are really good in a movie that is cleanly directed by Anthony Hemingway.  History is served just enough and the cliches are big and bold, just like an old-fashioned war movie should be.  This is a fine adventure picture and a worthy addition to the LucasFilm canon.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Super satisfying read that is WAY better than book 4. It's all of the best characters, with new twists. Leaves on a cliffhanger so I am waiting for book 6!
B008458O3S|5.0|Very fun game.  really enjoyed the creative thinking required and didn't want to stop until I had solved all the puzzles.  will be looking for new additions.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book took me the longest. Mostly because nothing I wanted to happen was happening. The whole second half of the book picked up until a sad unfortunate ending! This may sound like a negative review but I actually loved this book and the series.
B003Z2LAAO|4.0|Grand Canyon is a decent 3D nature film that explores the Canyon in 3D with good coverage.  It does have some political overtones about the environment but nothing that is not tolerated in the spirit of the documentary type film.  We purchased the film because it was in 3D and wanted a scenic documentary in our home collection.  It was worth the price and is enjoyable to watch for the scenry and 3D action.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A thrilling read, though the ending begs for a better twist. Ultimately a great suspense novel that gives the reader closure by the last page.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|A 60-year old movie. Sharp images, excellent sound, and a pleasure to watch, laugh, sing along, well . . . It was a pleasent surprise. The big production numbers, including, of course, Gene Kelly \\"Singing in the Rain,\\" were fun to watch and listen. I really didn't expect the dance/singing sequences to be this entertaining. This old movie, puts the current music videos and productions down where they belong. When the actors/actresses strut and sing with clarity and gymnastics, one wonders where it all went. Where are the Kellys, Reynolds and energetic Donald O'conners today? What happened to having an occasional \\"Big Production\\" number? Hollywood (generic term) relies on CG and extreme action for almost every movie, not to mention, but every movie seems to end with a chase! What happened to just enjoying a show with your family, including the kids? My eight-year old great-grandaughter practically flew off the walls dancing. When's the last time the little ones actually joined in the action of an adult movie without simply mimicking a super hero or a cartoon (CG) character?

0545425115|5.0|Okay, I know I am way behind on reviewing this and I won't try to summarize the plot but what I will say about The Hunger Games is that unlike many other books these days, it really kept my attention. It was an easy, entertaining and gripping read. That takes real skill on the part of the author. Enjoyed it greatly.

B005DOL0R0|2.0|The sleeve was too small for the Kindle Fire HD. It was too narrow to zip.  A nice-looking case, but didn't work for this product.
0062127241|4.0|So, I understand the book is heavily edited, and while I understand that it probably made it more accessible by the masses, I do think it would have been better with more details in several places.  Maybe a 'deluxe' version will appear someday.<br /><br />Even edited, it is still interesting.  Two things surprised me after reading.  First, it seems like Pete thoroughly enjoyed playing with the Who in the '79-'81 years with Kenney Jones.  His explanation about why Roger did not like Kenney's playing is pretty interesting, but Pete obviously enjoyed jamming with Kenney and John.  Second thing that surprised me was the tone of the book.  It doesn't seem like Pete had a lot of fun.  I don't mean that he doesn't relate some entertaining anecdotes, but for the most part, he talks more about the stress of touring, writing, recording, etc. and doesn't come across as having had many happy moments in life.  Perhaps that's not the case, he may have just thought that the bad and sad times make for more interesting reading.

1933771690|4.0|Anyone searching for the deeper answers to life will enjoy this book. It's easy to understand, even though it might be hard to grasp for some, at least you don't need a PhD to understand what's written. I remember as a youngster thinking these same thoughts about life, and it's exciting seeing them resurface with confirmation from a great scientist.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|As this story is told, the picture of Lincoln as an intelligent and essentially morally trustworthy man is brought to life.  The book well lays out the process that occurred as the Rivals became a team.  Lincoln's leadership and integrity persuades Bates, Chase, and Seward to follow his lead through intricate political waters, significant oppostion, high career risk, and evolving moral clarification.  There is a more than just passing relevance of this story to our own politically divided  and entrenched society seemingly beyond reconciliation.  In our culture we not yet ready to go to war to defend our perception of the right thing to do, but we could probably use another Lincoln any time now.

1936608618|5.0|Whether you are a seasoned triathlete stuck in the LSD rut of training, a CrossFitter who is looking to add endurance to your training, or the average couch potato just starting to scratch the surface, this book is for you.  It is the most comprehensive, user-friendly, and current book out there covering endurance training.  Most endurance books or plans just tell you to swim, bike, and run--miles or minutes or hours--but they don't tell you HOW to swim, bike, or run.  This book breaks it down in a simple format, with useful drills and applications that will get you stronger and faster than your previous training has.<br /><br />The book begins by explaining the \\"what and why,\\" and includes some of the science behind this methodology, and how it is different than what most people have heard or practiced with regards to endurance training.  The next chapters continue with breaking down running, biking, and swimming (each chapter is color coded for easy reference), describing common errors, and providing plenty of pictures, drills, and detailed information on mechanics and how to dial in correct form (really, they cover everything).<br /><br />The \\"meat\\" of the book and the most extensive chapter is \\"Strength and Conditioning as a Skill,\\" and it's easy to see why.  After reading the first chapter (the \\"what and why\\"), you realize that the very reason CrossFit Endurance is different than anything out there is the strength and conditioning piece--CrossFit.  This chapter literally breaks down EACH of the fundamental movements in CrossFit, in great detail (with excellent pictures and progressions).  Nothing is left uncovered--they've included it all, and broken the movements down further into categories (power lifting, olympic lifting, conditioning exercises, and trunk stability exercises).<br /><br />This book continues on to another key tenant within CrossFit Endurance: mobility (with Mr. Kelly Starrett, himself appearing in the pictures and the writing the text) for specific body parts (foot, ankle, and calf mobilization; upper leg, hip, and trunk mobilization, and t-spine and shoulder mobilization).<br /><br />The last two chapters of this book include: fueling and nutrition, and a hefty chapter on programming, complete with templates and sample WODs to try.<br /><br />I was very fortunate to receive an advanced copy of this book, and couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  Tackling this project was no small endeavor for Brian Mackenzie, but this book is in-depth, easy to reference, and different than anything you will read on traditional endurance currently \\"out there\\" today.  To the naysayers who say that CrossFit is a cult, or maybe that CrossFit Endurance is crazy--don't knock it until you try it.  What have you got to lose? If you are still training the same way you have always trained, marginally or not improving any of your race times, and constantly find yourself injured, then this is the program for you.<br /><br />I am an endurance athlete with the traditional long slow distance background, and since trying out the CrossFit Endurance approach, I have PRed in all of my running and triathlon events, feel stronger than I have ever felt before (both in racing and in how fast I recover), and best of all, since I've eliminated all the excess mileage and replaced it with solid programming focusing on quality, technique and form, I have more time on the weekends to spend with my family.<br /><br />This book is a fresh approach and exactly what the endurance community needs to be seeing and hearing about!

B0041KVW2K|1.0|After ordering two box sets and listening to both,I could not make a decent sounding set out of the two.Between the non-fill issues, crackles, skips and outright gouges in the vinyl (Abbey Road),I am disgusted with the choice of Rainbo Records to press these important reissues. The lack of quality control is astounding given the price paid for the sets.I guess you could get lucky and get a decent set the first time around, but I'm done with it,two strikes and I'm out.
075695195X|1.0|First of all, this is not a poor review of Stroud's novel.  It is a terrific read! My teenage sons and I all enjoyed the books in the Bartimaeus Trilogy.  My problem is with the quality of a recently purchased hardback copy of the book, which I bought to replace our original paperback that was loaned around so many times it got lost.  Unfortunately, this hardcover book is of exceedingly poor quality. The cover illustration looks like a knock-off and the paper is extremely thin -- like cheap newsprint. The publisher should be ashamed.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|We got this as an impulse buy the day after we left the hospital.  9 months later it is still our #1 baby buy.  When she was swaddled it stayed in her mouth better because the stuffed guy kept it in place.  In the beginning it was easy to replace the paci in the car because the frog was easy to grab onto from the front seat.  Regular pacifiers would drop down to the bottom of the car seat.  She also learned to replace the pacifier a lot faster with the frog to hold onto.  We love our wubbanub.  I read some reviews about washing it--I throw it in the washing machine.  It comes out almost all the way dry.  I either let it air dry or give it right to her.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Great game! And updated alot. About the time I think I'm finished they add another update...in ALL levels! Very addictive and well worth it!

B009ERK1T0|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet. I bought this album on release date. A week later, I've probably listened to it 15 times through. There's just something about it that hooks into you. Deftones have unlocked the soft/loud dynamic and are exploiting it expertly. What's more impressive is that they don't overpower you. They give their songs room to breathe, develop and set a mood. Koi No Yokan is fantastic. Easily one of my favorite albums of 2012.
1400069289|5.0|Thank you for the book, help me a lot. Very well written.  I cold not take my eyes from the book. One of the 3 top best I read in 2012. First have a greate system to understand the base to change habits. How make a product or service and create new habit and ways for the market to accept. Create anxiety ( Apple, Luis Vitton, Bugatti, Rolex, and many others do). The change  O'Neill have made in Alcoa a grate example for a leader to make changes everywhere. How only a change of one habit can have a grate impact on hole business. The Montgomery event, how transform in a big wave. The hole book gave me some grate new tools to work for my personal life and  business.

0385342063|4.0|I LOVE Sophie Kinsella. I know that her novels are predictable and her characters can be annoying sometimes but her books are so much fun! They're almost like modern day fairy tales.I like her standalone novels more than the Shopaholic series now( that series has been dragging on for too long now)<br /><br />I've Got Your Number doesn't disappoint.This book is fun,light and predictable but still manages to surprise you.<br /><br />I found Poppy to be a little annoying at times but I could connect to her and had a great time laughing at the situations she ended up in. One of my favorite 'situations' is when she's singing a businessman's name in All The Single Ladies tune and the time when she goes shopping for a ring.Those scenes were hilarious.<br /><br />I really liked Sam too. Another thing I love about Kinsella's novels is the fact that she never has male protagonist's that are mean and make you want to cause bodily harm to them unlike some male characters(*cough*  any male character character from House Of Night series *cough*).<br /><br />Overall,I really enjoyed this novel and hope that Sophie Kinsella keeps writing  fun standalone novels. Fans of chick-lit will love this one! I definitely did.<br /><br />Note: If you're aware of any standalone novel Sophie is working on please don't hesitate to inform me.You'll have my gratitude forever!<br /><br />My Rating:<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />GREAT FUN!
0062197258|5.0|I very much enjoyed the author's writing style.  Told in first person, this story weaves from past to present throughout the novel.  Gripping me from the very beginning, I found this to be one of those novels that just made me want to keep reading clear to the very end.  Catherine's journey to recovery from her abduction was long but very compelling.  I liked how the author gave her readers insight into the plight of those suffering from OCD and PTSD.  I highly recommend this gripping thriller.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I have the complete series. The acting, fight scenes great, and the message is clear. Buy it. This is why I gave the series 5 star.
B004SRNH10|4.0|Have an Asus tablet and it downloaded and works without a problem.  Game required this to be loaded but made it easy to add.  Would prefer the games not to take up extra space and run without additional software.
B004MARLJ2|2.0|Some apps fit different people in different ways, this one just didnt work for me.  I didn't catch on to the characters, more like a puzzle imo
B008D30K7E|5.0|Very imaginative writer and what wit. I really enjoyed reading it. It was recommended by a friend. Not my usual type of book but would definitely recommend!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed this very easy read book. I thought it would be childish, it wasn't. It was thoughtful and the kind of book you feel with instead of just read, Your heart breaks, and then you find your self smiling within pages. I would reccomend for all ages.

B005PJU16O|5.0|My husband is a Volkswagon fanatic, especially for the Transporter.  When I stumbled upon this Lego set a few months before my husband's 46th birthday, I bought it without hesitation.  Waited with excitement for a couple of months, and then got my reward in my husband's surprise and happiness when he opened it.<br /><br />To me, that right there garners the 5-star rating.<br /><br />But, there is more.  While Lego items are always high quality, the attention to detail that went into this one is amazing.  Curtains, decals and, well, EVERYTHING is fantastic.<br /><br />He hasn't had a chance to built it yet but is looking forward to the challenge with the TWO instruction books that came with it.<br /><br />If you love Legos and VWs, you should definitely consider this set!
0345404475|5.0|In the future, radioactive dust has wiped out nearly all living creatures. Many humans have emigrated to Mars and of those who remain on Earth, many have been deeply affected physically and philosophically by the loss. Humans have learned to embrace a loving respect for all life now. Most people want to own something living, and those who cannot afford to buy mechanical replicas.<br /><br />  To help out in the hard work that there is in the colonies, humans have developed bio-engineered \\"androids\\". The problem is that these androids seem to be peeking at human thought and actions. Some have broken away and are trying to live on their own. Bounty hunters like Rick Deckard hunt the illegal ones and \\"retire\\" (destroy) them. The problem is that the only way to tell the difference between them and humans is to test their level of empathy towards life.<br /><br />  That is where the fundamental question of the book comes in - at what point do these \\"androids\\" become \\"living\\" and at what point to the hunters move beyond having empathy for life? How does each side react to these questions?<br /><br />  This is the book that \\"Bladerunner\\" was based on, but the storyline and development are very different (with a similar line of thought throughout). Fans of the movie should read this - it opens up a much deeper idea behind the character of Rick Deckard and is even more thought-provoking than the movie. The book itself though, has far less action and much of the violence (which the movie emphasized) is written as more of a side line to the philosophical questioning going on. That line of empathy and what makes humans \\"human\\" is the essential thought being teased out.<br /><br />  Well worth reading.<br /><br />(For even more fun, read this while considering whether Deckard may be an \\"android\\" or not...)

0812984412|5.0|As an admirer of David Mitchell's novels, including Black Swan Green and The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, I had put off reading Cloud Atlas in the way one might savor the prospect of dessert. It finally came off my shelf ahead of the release of the movie based on the book. And for a fan like me, the novel was dazzling, while the movie was a disappointment. However, it might be different for a different reader.<br /><br />Here's why: the novel is full of wit and wordplay, puzzles and secrets. It's sometimes hard to keep the interwoven plots straight, and you have to be comfortable giving yourself up to the sheer force of the novel as it tumbles you along, from century to century and back again. If you dislike non-linear stories and avoid Russian novels because you can't keep the characters straight, Cloud Atlas might not be for you.<br /><br />But you might like the movie, although it is still sometimes hard to follow, particularly the various dialects, which are easier to read than to listen to. What the movie does do is pare down each of the stories and intensify the focus on the main characters. The \\"karma\\" idea, subtle in the novel, is pulled to the fore in the movie. The tight transitions from story to story also help to clarify the connections among them.<br /><br />And here's the thing: if you see the movie, it won't spoil the book, not at all. There are great chunks of the novel that never make it into the film, and the sci-fi story, set in a twenty-second century \\"corpocracy,\\" is so changed (into a silly Matrix-like spectacle) that to encounter it in print is a kind of relief along the lines of \\"Aha, now I get it!\\"  You could think of the movie as a kind of outline for the novel.<br /><br />Remember the way a good teacher can illuminate a complicated book in a way that gradually makes it quite accessible and then pleasurable? Cloud Atlas, the movie, for all its omissions and movie-dazzle, for all its too-obvious moralizing and computerized special effects, might well bring a reader straight to the pleasures of the incomparable Cloud Atlas, the novel.<br /><br />M. Feldmancts, might well bring a reader straight to the pleasures of the incomparable Cloud Atlas, the novel.<br /><br />M. Feldman

0812984412|1.0|Back cover and movie trailer sucked me in...\\"brilliant original fiction that reveals how disparate people connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds in the sky\\".  Three weeks later, halfway through the \\"Sloosha's Crosson' an' Ev'rythin' After\\", I have decided to keep my time and quit reading.  When I stopped reading, I checked in on some of the reviews here and felt a little better that I wasn't the only person that was disappointed by this book.  I am floored that so many people have given this a good review.  People either seem to love or hate this book.  I am definitely in the hate group.  I found the stories slow and the characters uninteresting.  I was completely put off by the dialect device used in some of the stories...the author uses it like a cheap parlour trick and it adds absolutely nothing but confusion to the story.  To see that done well with a purpose, try Zora Neale Hurston.  Here, it just made a slow story that much more unreadable.  The stories were definitely disparate but nothing ever connected in a meaningful way.  I would skip this altogether.
B0091REZMW|3.0|really enjoy these games but admit I refuse to pay for diamonds etc. if I have to buy I stop playing. so far the game is good
B008M0NDOK|3.0|June 10, 2013 Update - Well, this great product is officially dead. There will be no more new games for it and I've even heard rumors that the company has gone out of business. It's a shame. I really enjoyed it. I still absolutely hate trying to play a FPS game on the iPad using touch controls. These guys were on to something and they blew it.<br />So, you can buy this if you want. It's so cheap now. But the list of games you see are all you're gonna get. MC4 will NEVER work with this controller.<br />I'm going to take away a star from my review just because of how poorly they managed this product.<br />-----------------<br />Jan. 29, 2013 Update - The official website for this product says that support for Modern Combat 4 is coming soon!<br />-----------------<br />Original review:<br />I am not, nor have I ever been, a hardcore gamer. I've played PC games and owned some consoles in the past, but gaming is not my #1 hobby. When I have time, I like to play a game here and there but just don't have hours and hours of time to sit in front of a TV and play on a console. This is why the great quality games that are coming out for the iPad have been great for me. If I have an extra 10 minutes, I can grab it and play for a while no matter where I am.<br /><br />My one complaint is that I found controls for first-person shooters to be very difficult to master. Simply put, I hated the interface every time I tried it. I need to feel the controls and buttons with my hands.<br /><br />The Duo Gamer totally fixes this problem. The controls are laid out like your standard console controller and it's very easy to use. Setup is a snap. Just pair it with Bluetooth and the games immediately recognize the controller.<br /><br />You'll see in some older reviews that Modern Combat 3 does not work with the Duo Gamer. That may have been the case then, but it is not now. MC3 DOES work with the Duo Gamer now and is a blast to play.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint, like others, is that there are only 5 games that work with this controller right now. I'm not going to worry too much about that yet as MC4 is on the horizon and this product was only released 1-2 months ago. I'm going to give Gameloft the benefit of the doubt that we'll see more games that work with this controller in the near future.<br /><br />I will agree that this limited number of games does make the $79 price tag tough (Note, price has since been lowered). I admittedly would probably not have purchased it had I not gotten a gift card and wanted to treat myself.<br /><br />That being said, I'm glad I did make the purchase. I'm enjoying the heck out of the three FPS games that Gameloft has for this controller.<br /><br />I would give this 5 stars if there were more games. Otherwise, it's awesome.re only 5 games that work with this controller right now.

1439152802|5.0|My only regret is that I found Kate Morton's books before she has written hundreds of them. I first read Distant Hours and of course I loved it. I did a search for her other titles and read them all. I was always disappointed to finish. Such splendid writing that puts the reader inside the pages living the lives with the people inside. I am hard pressed not to figure out how  movies or books will end. Not with Morton's books. She always surprises me. While waiting for Morton to finish her next book I started reading Thomas H Cook books. Morton said that he  was one of her favorites. I do enjoy Cook very much,but Cook doesn't hold a candle to Morton. I can only selfishly hope she writes really fast.
B0068FYZCA|5.0|Forget Star Wars, this could be the best movie George Lucas ever made.  I remember seeing it in the movie theater--a lot of the themes went over my head but I still laughed and loved the characters, especially seeing Ron Howard all grown up--I was still watching Andy Griffith reruns.  It was a pre-cursor to Happy Days would would premiere a few months later.  Watching the movie again, I fell in love with the simple stories and the characters.  I didn't realize how revolutionary certain aspects were: the nearly wall to wall soundtrack, the manipulation of the music to make it match the film (inside of a gym vs inside of a car vs out in the street), the documentary style look to the film, and the cutting back and forth between the four main characters.  Special camera rigs were developed so that the actors could talk to each other while cruising down the street in cars.  I always remembered certain scenes--such as Suzanne Somers tempting head shot in a white car--but gained new insight when Lucas describes her as a siren tempting Steve to remain in his small town.  The commentary track by Lucas is superb, he brings you along his struggle to make the movie and shares a lot of memories about the film.  The documentary is also great, more than an hour about how the film was conceived, financed, produced and released.  You see all the key players as they are today.  It's inconceivable that Universal wanted to burn this off as a TV-movie.  It was such a huge hit when released and I remember everyone in my family loved it.  Nearly every actor cast in this movie went on to bigger and better things:  Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Harrison Ford, Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith, Candy Clark, Cindy Williams and more.  I highly recommend the movie and this blu ray edition.

Since the first page I was completely hooked up! I couldn't stop reading and crying as I went with them on their journey to understand love, life and that some bad things could've happened to good people!<br /><br />You have to read this book and let all the tears be dropped: you won't regret it!

B002I0J5FG|2.0|I know ICO only has a very small following, so I'll just focus on SotC.  The idea of moving through an open world is an okay one, but it's really not that large, and the boss fights are mostly a sequence of simon says type quicktime events.  You can ride on a horse.  Congratulations.  Perhaps there was some degree of novelty to aspects of these games in the PS2 era (if you ignore PC games of the time at least), but today they seem more like undeveloped proof of concepts rather than fully fleshed out games.

These encounters are often funny, but also give the reader insight into Harold's personality.  The walk to save his coworker has been well-crafted by Rachel Joyce into the novel's true reason for Harold Fry's pilgrimage.

B000026FJ6|3.0|My biggest issue with Songs of Distant Earth is that the actual creative ideas are few and far between, and instead the album focuses on taking simplistic musical ideas, wrapping an adventurous outer space theme around them, and repeating these ideas for several minutes until the *next* theme arrives.  Amarok blows this album clear out of the water in terms of sheer creativity and instrumental variety.  However, I have to be careful here.  Mike Oldfield *is* the originator of the genre known as world music.  It'd be unfair and pretty lousy on my part to really rip into the album knowing Mike practically invented this type of music (or rather, radically changed and defined it- originality is all opinion anyway, it seems).<br /><br />My intention isn't to rip into the album anyway because I like it.  I like the album overall- it's a pleasant voyage through space.  However it's impossible to look beyond the fact that this is mainly intended as background or sleeping music (the occasional bombastic guitar parts being an exception).  The African chants were used better on Amarok, and the amount of musical instruments was more satisfyingly detailed on Amarok as well (though I admit it's because Amarok feels like an updated continuation of Tubular Bells so I simply prefer those two albums the most).  Actually the piano parts are REALLY good.  These appear around 20 minutes in and bring me close to crying on a few occasions.<br /><br />Oh, and as another reviewer points out below, this album sounds horribly dated of the mid 90's when bands were using really clean and beautiful recording technology so the music *sounds* great, but the actual instrumental passages themselves -if one were to examine each musical passage throughout the album note for note- are mediocre.  55 minutes of fluff?  Not quite, but clearly not everything here gives off a sensation of satisfaction nor offers much in the way of replay value, and you have to really set out to make a clear distinction between Songs of the Distant Earth and several other Pink Floyd knockoffs in order to approach this album with an open mind.  Of course this is still leagues better than Discovery.  Both albums are dated, but at least Songs of the Distant Earth isn't a complete failure.  No pop songs in sight which can only be a wonderful idea.  Best idea of all, even.

B004JMY312|5.0|It's just good old fashion fun, no dirty jokes, no nudity. Movie makers today should take notes and make more movies like this.
B000002NCW|2.0|Maybe I shouldn't have been so harsh on the Songs of Distant Earth.<br /><br />\\"Mont St. Michel\\" is pure meditation-insipid nonsense.  What seems like an inspiring instrumental piece that's nice and beautiful, underneath the pretty coating of paint is actually a really basic and forgettable 12-minute flow of orchestration and acoustic guitar that's *severely* uninspiring.  Some of this stuff sounds so basic I wonder what the point of even creating it was.  Maybe to show that Mike Oldfield can make his music stand on top of the world and sweep everyone off their feet.  Well if THAT was his intention when creating this piece, he already accomplished such a level of awesomeness back with Tubular Bells.  The Irish folk elements that Oldfield frequently falls back on seem to disappear in all the overblown orchestration eventually too.  What a shame.  Despite all this, the London Symphony Orchestra is still amazing, but... did Mike Oldfield really need to write a piece like this to prove his epic worthiness?<br /><br />\\"Women of Ireland\\" is instrumentally empty and soulless.  More basic writing by Oldfield's usually MUCH higher standards.  The fact this 6-minute track moves at a crawl doesn't help matters.  Speaking of songs that are too slow for their own good, \\"Flowers of the Forest\\" is made worse by the fact the Uillean pipes repeat like mad.  Piano appears but, seriously, what's the point?  It never does anything enticing.  In fact I can only make out a few notes.  That's pretentiousness for you.  The chants come in but the repetitive melody remains.  Under the \\"pretty\\" arrangements it's just another generic Irish folk tune.  Irish music deserves more respect than this.  \\"Dark Island\\" contains more prettiness, and is an improvement thankfully.  The melody is still shamelessly bland!  AH!!!  What happened Mike, seriously?  Come on!  I think it's obvious what happened- Mike thought it'd be a great idea to take advantage of the recording technology of the mid 90's that was probably capable of capturing his idea of a perfect musical adventure, meanwhile paying no regard to actual *songwriting*.<br /><br />\\"The Hero\\"... MORE repetitive blandness with another helping of artificial flutes that paint a generic picture of a wonderful country (Ireland).  \\"Wild Goose Flaps Its Wings\\" is only memorable for featuring guitar parts and \\"Celtic Rain\\" sounds pretty but who even knows why.  It blends in with the rest of the material.  Unless you have no experience or understanding of the country of Ireland or their culture, this music may sit perfectly well with you but for me, and anyone else that considers Tubular Bells and other 70's and early 80's Oldfield albums classics?  I know for a FACT Mike Oldfield is capable of better.

B004X75RK4|5.0|Enjoyed the movie. Sandra is crisp, Ryan is funny. I've seen this movie a few times, and I laugh every time. It's a nice chick flick that is very easy on the eyes. Story is interesting, some very funny scenes. Don't worry that it's a movie with hype that isn't funny. You will laugh, which is a great test of a comedy film . Enjoy!

B009WO7NQO|5.0|When i heard my favorite mobile game was going to butt heads with one of my favorite franchises, i knew i had to look into it. The birds are back but with hair and clothes; an idea that's just as ridiculous but humorous as the original game and its concept. The soundtrack<br />has a nice take on the main Star Wars theme with the menu theme. The Darth Vader piggy's cackle at your defeat is also strangely more funny than irritating. The gameplay presents new challenges that help to add a little depth to traditional Angry Birds gameplay and do so without posing too much of a nuisance. The varying environments are merely cosmetic but don't necessarily need to be more than that. in general, everything comes together under two banners and manages to satisfy fans of both. This is a game that  Star Wars fans and Angry Birds fans can rally under.
B00917IQFY|5.0|Graham Parker is both one of the most under-appreciated artists of the past 35 + years as well as one of the most consistently great over that span of time. His new album \\"Three Chords Good\\" is backed by the Rumour for the first time in over 30 years. Up until they parted ways after 1980, the Rumour backing Graham Parker was the one backing band that could have given Springsteen's E Street Band a run for its money. Graham Parker went on to make one very good - fantastic album after another in the 30 years since he parted ways with the Rumour. That said, as great as many of those non Rumour Graham Parker albums were, they probably all would have been even better had the Rumour still been backing him. Which brings us to the new album \\"Three Chords Good\\". This is a typically great Graham Parker album that's made even greater due to the Rumour being back on board. Hopefully Graham Parker's being featured in the upcoming movie \\"This is 40\\" will give this new album the much needed exposure to actually sell a non-trivial amount of copies. \\"Three Chords Good\\" is among the best albums that's been released this year. Each of its 12 songs is fantastic. The album features great singing, great lyrics, a great backing band and great melodic tunes with infectious hooks that you can't get out of your head. It's a near perfect album.r scattered about.

1594203334|5.0|You would have to have a preconceived biased against French culture and/or an alternative style of parenting not to be delighted this book. And truthfully, the parenting methods related here aren't all that alternative. Traditional is probably a better word. Where American parents tend to be obsessively hands-on, the French are decidedly hands-off.<br /><br />The author, Pamela Druckerman, is an American expatriate, married to an Englishman, and living in Paris. She is in a unique position to observe, and often marvel at, the differences of both countries. Druckerman's writing style is so appealing here--replete with that right amount of sympathetic humor--that you look forward to tagging along all the way to the end.

Geez, Hollywood, I guess you assume your entire audience is a bunch of freaking retards. Well, I suppose you're right. I spent $3.99 and all I got was 2.5 seconds of where the Alien came from. Hint:from a guy's gut.<br /><br />Actually, come to think of it, there was four bucks worth of information in this movie. If you are ever trying to run away from a giant ring shaped space ship that is falling down toward you and rolling along it's perimeter, turn 90 degrees and run, rather than run along the path of the falling space ship.
0312330529|5.0|This book is truly a masterpiece that once I started reading, I had trouble putting down. It is powerful and well-written. The story has something for everyone, with elements of crime, love, war, and excitement.<br /><br />I honestly can't recommend this enough, especially if you have taken a trip or plan to take a trip to Mumbai. It will show you the beauty of parts of the city that you otherwise might only drive past.
B0083GQVXI|5.0|This was a very frightening look at life after your child has committed a heinous act against his school.  This woman could be anyone.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|So far (through 5 books) this might be the best book of the series. There is so much that happened in this book that I want to go back and read it again.<br />I would recommend reading this even if you are considering waiting for season 3 of the show to come out first. It will give you more depth and background that the show only touches on.
B003MC5L9S|5.0|Some things that we have within us all and have rarely used<br />The tools described in this book to delve in the power of the subconscious are easy and readily usable.<br />Results immediate for all to see.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you have watched the show and are considering picking up the books, I highly recommend it. The books are even more entertaining than the show and will give you so much more depth and background that the show only touches on. Once you start reading them, they are tough to put down.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Repent buying this book.<br />This book just gives sometime of instant gratification. But nothing memorable.<br />This book caters to the lowest denominator in a human being.<br />Maybe initially just like any other pornographic material there was initial excitement, but unlikely to add to any human enrichment
1616960922|5.0|The less than glowing reviews of some folks leave me a bit baffled.<br /><br />The Emperor's Soul is a book that drops the reader into a strange world with its own physical rules and manages to almost instantly acclimatize them. While a few cliches were unavoidable, as is often the case in a short format, the ones that did exist were mostly well done. The book followed a stock Sanderson character arc; that of the benevolent thief. The man has a penchant for Robin Hood type stories. I don't mind though; it's always nice to visit another twist/take on Kelsier & Vin.<br /><br />What really made this book work for me were its pacing and its symmetry. I never found myself skipping over a section because I was bored or irritated. Potentially dry moments were clipped almost before they could register. The one utility-cliche that I didn't enjoy was the lack of development regarding antagonist's motives (as opposed to their character, which didn't really matter). The whole politics as usual angle just felt a little bit stale, though in the end it didn't actually hurt the story. I just felt as though that particular element could have been a bit richer and less bloated by stereotypical hypocrisy. Sanderson more than made up for that nitpick the last chapter when the character arcs of Shai and Gaotona resolve.<br /><br />Some readers will find the payoff too moral for their tastes. If you don't mind a bit that in your fantasy, you should quite enjoy the way Sanderson stitches up the plot at the finish line.<br /><br />Of one thing I am certain though: this story would translate gracefully into a motion picture. Interesting development, that... stay tuned?
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Jamie McGuire has completely blown me away with this book! I absolutely loved this book as much as I love the character Travis! I have never smiled so much while reading a book. I would highly recommend  this book to any and everyone. I was looking for a great book to read after 50 Shades of Grey and this book did not disappoint. I cannot wait for Walking Disaster, another book in the series I will purchase without hesitation. You will not be disappointed with this book.

This album is similiar to her last one but with more swaggg.

0316228532|2.0|Ok, so it's no Harry Potter, that's for sure.  I made myself finish the book just so I could say I finished the book.  I will say it was well written.  I felt like it was a reality tv show, but I was reading it instead of watching it.  Apparently high school didn't end for some people.  All that back-stabbing, plotting, hate, etc...it is quite a depressing book.  Maybe it's just me and I've been reading too many young adult books lately, but I wanted at least a somewhat happier ending.  I won't give it away, but ugh.  And there's just toooooo many people to keep track of!  I felt like I was back in high school reading one of William Faulkner's books (Absolom, Absolom?  As I Lay Dying?) where there was just so many people to keep track of that you almost couldn't.  I hope the next book she writes will be less depressing.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Impressive follow up to dragon tattoo. Only problem is the next book is the last one, gonna have to read it slowly...
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I have to call Cloud Atlas one of the best books I've ever read (Pillars of the Earth is the other one). I've read other 'collection' style novels before. Even one or two with a continuing theme. Never have I read one like this. Each 'chapter' takes on a different style and feel. It's as if a different author in a different era wrote each piece, yet they still overlap perfectly. Sometimes obvious, other times subtle. It's perfect. I could go on all day about the story itself, but I don't think this is that sort of review. If you haven't read this novel, read it. If you're thinking of buying it for someone else, please do. They will thank you later.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Nelson DeMille has done it again or I should say that John Corey, the main character stays true to form in his role.  Without going into detail that gives away the plot or the outcome of the story, Nelson DeMille expands the breadth and depth of John Corey is this new thriller.  For those of you that have followed the previous adventures of John Corey, you may think that he is one smart a**, egocentric, pain in the neck kind of guy.  He is. However, John is more than that.  In the early development of this character, Corey was a funny, smart a** kind of guy that you came to tolerate and enjoy.  But in this thriller, Corey goes deeper wanting to know why people (i.e. terrorist from affluent backgrounds) choose to be self-destructive and destructive of others when presented with opportunities to be very successful in life.<br /><br />Why does someone exposed to an affluent lifestyle from cradle to adulthood grow to hate in such extremes?  What is missed?  What do we know, but choose to ignore or dismiss?  This thriller, through the eyes of John Corey raises these questions and many more.  Not only does this give better insight into the character John Corey, as a Thinking Man, but it also provides insight as to why learning, knowing, and understanding history is fundamental into how we come to conceptualize and think about our own surroundings.  While John may show complete disdain being taught and learning about this history, do not be fooled.  He is constantly processing and thinking about how this information can be quite useful.<br /><br />If you are looking for strong men to leap through glass, dodge bullets, scale tall building and kill all the bad guys, this is not a thriller for you.  However, if you are looking to laugh, and be thrilled by sorting and thinking through a lot of the mess called everyday life (in the end, is that not what history is), this is the book for you.

He then traces and writes the letters and numbers himself.  My older son reads the words I write and solves the math problems that I give him.  He then practices his spelling words and various other words I quiz him on.  We also play tic tac toe and hangman.  It's fun to use, saves paper and saves my sanity when we are in a situation where they have to sit and be calm for long periods of time when they would rather be running and jumping~you know, acting like boys.

B0006J28BO|4.0|Haru is your typical teenage girl. She goes to school. She plays sports. She wonders if a certain boy will ever notice her. In short, whether you're Japanese or American and whether you're you're 17 or 32, you will sympathize with Haru because once you were her. Except you probably didn't save a cat from being hit by a truck. And if you did, your cat probably wasn't the prince of a cat kingdom. And you probably weren't told by the Prince's father that you were now going to marry the Prince as a reward.<br /><br />So what happens when all that happens to Haru? She turns to cats for help of course. The name of the film is the Cat Returns. And which cat? Well, there is The Baron (Of Whisper of the Heart fame) and then there is Muta (that grouchy fat white cat also from Whisper of the Heart). But suddently, just as Haru thinks that her problems are solved, she is kidnapped and taken to the Cat Kingdom where she will be forced to marry the Prince. Now The Baron and Muta follow her to the Cat Kingdom where they must find a way to rescue Haru from the King before she is turned into a cat forever and married away without any choice of her own.<br /><br />I was wavering on whether to give this three or four stars, but it's probably around a 3.5. I have now watched 14 Studio Ghibli films consecutively (and 16 overall). This one is the weakest by far and my least favorite so far. It is not to say it is bad, but compared to the rest it seems like it lacks some depth and is overall a bit too juvenile. Nothing wrong with that, but when you compare it to some of the other Studio Ghibli films, it just doesn't stack up.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i thought it was going to be a stupid game!!! but its truely addicting!!! its also not as easy as it looks ( the larger grids)
B009LDXQGW|5.0|The Weeknd hasn't really been a big name in music, but after making appearances in Drake's fantastic \\"Crew Love\\" and Wiz Khalifa's mediocre \\"Remember You\\", he's been able to get a little bit of mainstream attention. He released three mixtapes in 2011 and this is simply all three of those mixtapes remastered and put together into this little package (with three extra tracks).<br />After diving into any of the three parts of this album, it's immediately noticeable that you have never heard anything like this. Production values are excellent and every song will throw you into this seductive daze that is incredibly engrossing. You really won't want to stop listening to this. Unfortunately, the three parts aren't all as good as each other.<br />You start out with part one (House of Balloons), which sits kind of in the middle of the three tracks, it features one of the best songs on the album \\"Wicked Games\\", which is one of the most mainstream songs, but it still fits well with everything else. Other highlights include \\"Loft Music\\", \\"House of Balloons\\", and \\"High For This\\". Though it is the middle of the three, it's still a fantastic piece.<br />Thursday is part 2 of the album, and it stands out as the weakest part of the album. \\"Lonely Star\\", and \\"Life of the Party\\" are two of the stand out tracks, while \\"The Birds\\" (both parts 1 & 2) are the highlights. The biggest issue I have with it is that, when compared to the other two parts, it doesn't have as much of a personality. It's also worth mentioning that \\"The Zone (Featuring Drake)\\" is also a fantastic song.<br />We end on a high note with Echoes of Silence. It's the darkest of the Trilogy, and it also features some of the best songs on the Album. D.D. is the first track, it's a re-imagining of Michael Jackson's song \\"Dirty Diana\\" (Hence the title D.D.), it's one of the most easily likeable songs on the Album. \\"XO\\", \\"Same Old Song\\" keep us happy, we reach the climax of the Album. The song \\"Next\\" is absolutely incredible, The Weeknd's voice goes almost seamlessly with the emotionally gripping beat, production values are off the charts, and the lyrics are some of, if not the best, the best we've seen on the album. We end on \\"Echoes of Silence\\" and \\"Till Dawn\\", which are both excellent songs that end the album well.<br />Simply put, Trilogy is an absolute Masterpiece. You have never heard anything like this, and that's a good thing. If I had one complaint, it's that the album lasts nearly two and a half hours, so unless you really dedicate your time listening to this album several times over, it's going to be hard to appreciate every song The Weeknd has to offer.<br /><br />FINAL SCORE: 9.25/10
B00991TCOG|4.0|very original! i love the combinations and compilations that stirling uses in her music, it's very addicting and inspiring! I recommend this album to everyone.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|Fun to play--more challenging than I thought it would be.  More directionality options than AB. I would highly recommend this game.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Unrelated British retirees each for their own reason and economics find an advertisement for a beautiful and reasonable retirement &quot;Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.&quot; When they get there they find that the advertised hotel may have been a little exaggerated. As they are each making the best of the situation in his/her own way they come to embrace the change. This is not to say that there are not trials and tribulations on their journey though life.<br /><br />Some viewers may be drawn into the movie by the names of some great actors but soon will come to know the characters as well.<br /><br />This film looks like it is getting a good rating by viewers that already know what to expect. In reality there is something for everyone. This is formula and we know what the ending will be but it is the journey and how it is presented that makes the movie extraordinary.<br /><br />If you like this movie then you will appreciate &quot;Enchanted April&quot; (1992).
B004SUWR2C|5.0|It's what it should be. Saw that this app has a low review and was surprised and curious as it has always worked fine for me and I've had it since last Christmas. If you like uno and you have a dollar then it's not a bad buy!
0062192930|5.0|This is in the usual Crichton style.  As an avid reader of his, this one is predictable in a few places but is still a great read.  You do not want to stop listening once you start.  Would recommend.

B0031RAOW8|5.0|Unless you want to cry your eyes out.  I don't care who you are... man, woman, boy or girl, if you don't shed a tear watching this, you have no heart.  I stumbled upon it on cable, one night, and though... cool, a movie about an Akita.  A little over an hour later, I was a wreck, and stayed a wreck until the movie was over.  It's a great movie, and probably did wonders for Kleenex stock.

1451629192|5.0|Well written and absolutely terrorizing acount of the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard.  This is possibly the first true crime book I had to take breaks from out of shear intensity and emotion.
B006VDNGA6|4.0|An incredible performance by Tilda Swinton, playing so many roles over such a long historical period; first as a man then a woman. Though very artsy in many ways, the film does drag at times (like many art pieces) with periods of great silence or reflection on a particular scene or theme. The cinematography is fantastic, clearly embellished by the many foreign locations, but also the attempts to create scenes and costumes of the differing periods. The costumes, are bizarre and wildly colorful at times, but I believe probably true to the times and climes they propose to represent. The actors on the whole do their parts well, offer quite a range of colorful personality types. As long as you are not expected a fast-paced modern techno drama, with all sorts of special effects, you will likely quite enjoy Orlando, with it's multilayered plot and story of a human living through many time periods changing personalities and sex, as easily as we change into a new set of clothes each day!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I start playing and cannot  put it down. If you like puzzles this is a great game. I would recommend  it.

B009DZDJU6|4.0|Not your typical vamp movie. Twists and turns keeps you interested. Made it more enjoyable. That's why I bought the whole Shebang/blu-ray/ultraviolet. 8 thumbs up.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Puzzle and logic-based games are what I usually like to play so this review may be biased in that direction. having said that \\"The Haunt\\" delivers plus provides excellent visuals while doing so. The puzzles in the game are everywhere and range from relatively easy to pretty difficult (at least for me). The game play is moderately linear but you have the freedom to roam around a bit and select the order in which you solve puzzles. All in all a very enjoyable game.
030759565X|5.0|I have been following the blog for several months now and every recipe has been a huge hit. The book is full of simple approachable recipes with unfussy ingredients.

0385751532|5.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas<br />  John Boyne<br /> The second I opened The boy in the striped Pajamas  I went on a journey. On this journey, I learned the value of friendship, love, hope and devotion. On this adventure I was not alone. I was with two nine year old boys. The boys' names are Bruno and Shmuel. The boys are young, innocent and lovable, but in the wrong place at the wrong time. Over the course of a few weeks, Bruno and shmuel become friends, yet they don't know their friendship is forbidden. All they know is that Bruno is German and Shmuel is Jewish and lives in Outwith ( Auschwitz). They also know that there is a fence that separates them, yet they don't know why.<br /> When Bruno finds out he is moving, he decides that he wants to spend one day with his friend on the same side of the fence. The day he is moving. Bruno rises early and heads to the fence. He climbs under it and heads off to spend his day with shmuel, but quickly realizes it wasn't what he expected at all.<br /> The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a beautifully written book. John Boyne made the character seem so real with his dialogue and description. This book changed my life and taught me that the grass isn't always greener on the other side, and that you shouldn't take things for granted. I recommend this book who simply wants an amazing read. This book made me cry, smile and get angry. I hope you read The Boy in the Striped pajamas.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|A few people will complain about this movie, but I would have to ask them what they expected.  It's a ridiculous movie with a ridiculous premise.  That having been said I enjoyed it.  I wouldn't nominate it for an award or pay more than the rental price; but it was a fun movie to watch while nursing a hangover.

B001LQQJ3E|5.0|For the price, you can't beat the value! Most of the shows are a treat to view after so many decades. All of the shows are an historical reflection of that halycon era  before the grisly JFK assassination, exuding values that Baby Boomers were raised to emulate.  While many of the shows can crack one up into guffaws of laughter, some of the earliest productions are tedious, to say the least. Nevertheless, anyone who buys this collation of old TV shows will get more than enough entertainment to justify the price. Moreover, you will get a better idea of what series, if any, you'd like to purchase in their entirety.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This album is perfect.  Adele 19 is best known for the song, 'Chasing Pavements' but there isn't a bad song on this album and each one will put a smile on your face.  I highly recommend this album.  Especially the songs 'Make you feel my love' and 'Daydreamer'.

1592402690|5.0|Reading Emerick's well written memoir reminds you that it was the freshness of the Beatles sound--that got you in to the songs--got you to listen --to pay attention--the sound kind of came with the territory or seemed to --whether it was the odd use of classical instruments--the clarity of a guitar riff or a harmony--it was inextricable part of the package--the Beatles listening experience.<br />But the Beatles listening experience it is necessary to remember was manufactured in a studio a sound that became more and more distinctive as the Beatles left their touring career and focused on mastering a new audio universe. The gatekeepers and wizards to that new world were two people--George Martin who Emerick persuades us may have taken a bit too much of the credit and of course the author--who when he meets the Beatles and begins engineering their sound (of course supervised by George Martin the producer)--is a fairly green working class London lad in his first job having recently graduated from Crouch End Secondary Modern school. He is a lower echelon technician in an uptight upper class EMI --an organization that seemed to be inhabited by post war colonel blimps full of their sense of class privilege. A tiered society that insisted that technicians wear white and custodians brown coats. The Beatles with their working class origins clearly did not fit the image that the EMI execs had polished for the elite Abbey Road studios but since they were recording on the comedy themed Parlophone label--with a producer who had made his name producing the Goon show they were tolerated. But increasingly the fab four grew to resent the restrictions that the Abbey Road studios presented--unable to move out of their surroundings during the height of their fame even to the cafeteria they had to be content to order in tea, sandwiches and take out food in the studio and virtually camp out for months at a time between while occasionally smoking substances behind makeshift screens and burning incense to cover the smells. Emerick details the numerous conflicts that emerged with some painstaking detail-- between the schoolboys and the schoolteacherly George Martin, the stingy EMI hierarchy that refused to allow him overtime for some of the Beatles late night sessions, the other technicians that viewed with alarm the unusual use of mics, sound effects, dubbing and other creative engineering feats that Emerick and his team were up to and of course between the fab four themselves as they began defining in much more detail than ever before who they were musically as individuals not just as members of the Beatles. The Abbey Road studios were quite primitive by today's standards--two track recorders but Emerick relishes the challenge of making the most of his equipment and makes you believe you too could be an improvisational recording engineer genius as you mic Ringo's drums and those classical violins in Eleanor Rigby. After reading about how the mono version of Sgt Pepper was done you too will want to dust off those Vinyl LPs and listen to them on your old granny --not the stereo version --the group made it for mono listening. You may never return to CDs after reading what Emerick has to say about digital recording.<br />There are plenty of other reasons to keep compulsively turning the pages. The book provides a first hand account of why the Beatles contrary to their sunny PR image were often miserable and become in the process of Emerick's retelling normal human beings rather than the fun loving geniuses of popular legend. They often felt trapped and pressured to perform. George Harrison would constantly flub his parts, Lennon would not remember lyrics and could summon incredible venom for the most trivial reason and inflict it on anyone --low or high in the EMI hierarchy.<br />Emerick is as good a witness to the highs and lows as anyone who has turned to writing a Beatles memoir --because of two reasons the first he keeps his ego in check--he is notso much after the famous fifth Beatle status that Martin has enjoyed--as helping to explain a highly complex collaboration --the essence of which was to try to capture what was going on inside the heads of John and Paul (mostly) and translate it into commercially viable vinyl. A trick much harder to bring off than would first appear. Second because he grows aware and helps you become aware of the amazing changes in temperament and confidence that begin to evolve as the group finds its new musical voices and how that sound kept changing. We get some terrific up close scenes of the larger than life John in his glory--his musical genius and his cruel mouth--his druggy haze, his poor memory for lyrics, weak eyesight and hatred of his own singing voice and boredom mixed with sudden passionate wild awakenings. Believing that Revolution 9 represented the future of the group and the direction they should take, hating Paul's \\"obla di and obli da\\" (what he referred to as Paul's Granny music) until he is prepared to strangle him or go out of his mind. On the other hand we get to see Pauls needling of John --sometimes through endless retakes that driove not just John to distraction but everyone else in the group.<br />Geoff Emerick in his unpretentious way creates Abbey Road as a theatre --a play in five main acts--Revolver--Sgt Pepper, Let it Be (Post India and off stage) and Abbey Road. Emerick is able to capture well how at each stage the demenour and musical development of each member (with the possible exception of Ringo who stays pretty constant throughout). In the early albums they were all entering stage left --in the beat up touring van driven by trusty bouncer Mal Evans, in later albums they arrive on stage separately foregoing their morning visit around Paul's Abbey Road mews house to practice their songs before arriving at the studio. Then the dramatic appearance of Yoko arriving in as crazy a way as any Hollywood producer could imagine--after a crew from Harrods department store sets up a bed in the studio and she is enthroned there after suffering with John a car accident in Scotland. You feel you are in the audience watching these exceptional musicians figure it out--as they try very hard to put the music above feuding. In the first few Acts it is clear that the dedication is to the individual song that typically one of them brings to the group and they magically perfect relying on the technical crew to translate their vision--Paul more coherently than John stating how he wants the instruments to sound--John vaguely asking the engineers things like making his voice sound as if he is on the moon. Then more frequently in subsequent acts the late night jamming and the search for a song in the chaos.<br />By the end of the book you are glad that the Beatles existed, found their ideal partners and also glad they found their freedom--and surprisingly you dont hate anyone --not even Yoko sitting in her bed and never daring after her first effort which the entire group treats a a major code violiation to make a comment on their performance.so much after the famous fifth Beatle status that Martin has enjoyed--as helping to explain a highly complex collaboration --the essence of which was to try to capture what was going on inside the heads of John and Paul (mostly) and translate it into commercially viable vinyl.

B002NZV68U|3.0|I grew up with the original version and there are some things you really wanted this to have. The biggest let down to me was the Oompa Loopa. I feel ripped off that this movie only had 1 and the rest were computer generated. I a sure there are plenty of little people in Hollywood that would love to be in this movie. If anything the movie company was being cheap and trying to save buck. Johnny Depp was great as always.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|By far the best book of the series. Makes you rush to get book 3 before you are done with 2 so you won't have to stop!!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book is definitely a think piece that has undertones far deeper and more meaningful than the story presented on the surface. It is an easy read, but can be interpreted on a variety of levels. The only thing that really bothers me about this kid is how his intelligence fails to come across in his letters but is apparently evident in his papers for his teacher.  This disconnect doesn't make sense to me despite my appreciation and understanding of the simplistic free writing style chosen by  the author to display innocence and a child like quality. Overall a very good book but will never be a favorite of mine.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yes it's very detailed in every aspect... So if you can handle that it is a wonderful story that makes you want more!

B0006Z2KYI|5.0|Carole Lombard and Jack Benny were brilliant acting and comedic geniuses.  They could and should have been the best acting and comedic pair in history, prevented by the early and tragic death of Carole Lombard.  Add to this the witty dialogue, suspense, and anti-Nazi message, and here is a movie that is a classic for all times.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|`The Pianist' is one of those films that stays with you long over you've watched it.  In fact, I haven't seen the film for roughly eight years or so and yet I still remember it remarkably well.  The triumph of the human spirit and the will to survive is rarely portrayed with such earnestness and raw honesty.  In fact, there is so much heft to this film that it is almost hard to take in at times.<br /><br />It's heavy, that's for sure.<br /><br />Telling the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, `The Pianist' recounts the horrors of the Holocaust with riveting action.  This true story centers on Szpilman's escape from captivity and his journey of survival and he is forced into hiding.  As he moves from one are to the next, we see those who aided in his survival by putting him up, bringing him supplies and food and yes, even those who left him to die on his own.  Some balk at the fact that Szpiman's story isn't of much importance; that he didn't accomplish anything remarkable or that this one man's story isn't impactful enough, but to them I balk at their reasoning.  This singular tale is really a universal story of triumph in the face of adversity and shows that dwelling in each and every one of us is the power and strength of overcome and prevail regardless of the perils in front of us.<br /><br />Beautifully acted and directed, both Brody and Polanski earned those Oscars.  Brody is phenomenal as the tortured Szpilman.  He ages remarkably with the time, allowing the true nature of his situation to impact his every being as the film progresses.  Polanski uses the right amount of restraint, reigning in so as not to allow his film to become a saccharine mess, which it so easily could have been reduced to.  Instead, `The Pianist' becomes something so much more.  It has heart and soul but it maintains a grit that allows it to speak volumes with an honest interpretation of one of the most heartless times in human history.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is a very addictive game. good for the brain. keeps me busy. easy to learn also. I would recommend it to everyone.
B004GJVI5C|5.0|Awesome movie!!!! Incredible. All the actors were superb in their performance. Very believable. Action was amazing. Great cinematography. Awesome story line.
B0045XICB2|4.0|THE movies of the TWILIGHT SAGA are all very similar....it[s the same dilemma of Bella and her 2 lovers, one being a sweet vampire and the other a giant wolf(warewolf???)...ECLIPSE is way more interesting than NEW MOON, which i think is the worst of the saga.....in fact, this one maybe is the coolest of all!!!!The TWILIGHT SAGA is good....a litthe naive, for teenage girls, but a nice story.....
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I saw this movie at the theaters and couldn't wait to buy the DVD.  The movie is a great movie (especially for women)!  Suzeq721
B006YXTRHY|4.0|BREAKING DAWN is a decent movie for the TWILIGHT loooooong SAGA....it[s a good movie, a little mellow, but a good sequence of TWILIGHT SAGA, with the strange giant wolves(warewolves?????) and the sweet kind vampires!!!!
0316017922|5.0|I needed to read this for a class project.  I was very impressed with the value of the book, especially since I didn't necessarily need a new book.  I even gifted a friend with a copy.  Thanks!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Although I have only begun my journey through this book, it already seems to me to be very clear indeed and exactly what is needed for anybody wishing to break into the e book market.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book was amazing. I love all Nicholas Sparks books and have not been disapointed so far by any of his books
B00846REIS|3.0|i hate to say everyone is copying 50 shades, because that just isn't true.  this book was well written- sylvia day recreated new york for me, and I could just imagine the heroine, she was drawn perfectly in my mind.  The book has a great setting, great cast (though everyone has model good looks!), and the story moves at a quick pace.<br /><br />That being said....<br /><br />1. WAY TOO MUCH SEX - Jeez.  these people have nothing in common, or if they do, they don't realize it, because all they do is screw as a way of solving there relationship problems.<br />2. UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP - their relationship is totally damaged in a way that wasn't sexy or romantic to me at all<br />3. INCOMPLETE.  It's a trilogy - (aren't they all right now?) and it leaves you hanging.  I don't mind trilogies as long as they give you some conclusion, not forcing you to buy the next book.<br /><br />Total thoughts - I'd pass on it.  Not worth $9.99.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|For starters, I did NOT purchase my boxed set from Amazon. Although the price was reasonable, Amazon decided to charge me tax which put it outside the price ranges of other sellers, for me. I recommend buying this boxed set from Amazon, as long as you don't have to pay shipping or tax.<br /><br />The set is very heavy by itself due to the 180g vinyl records alone. The set also includes a very nice book. It is the most complete stereo LP set to date amd includes all the Beatles original British albums, plus the American originated Magical Mystery Tour and the 2 Past Masters albums.<br /><br />The box says \\"Capitol Records\\" on it, the LP's within were pressed by Rainbo Records. As Capitol got rid of all it's U.S. pressing plants, the vinyl pressings are outsourced, which is a good thing anyway. Of late, the Capitol LP's that have been released domestically over the last couple of years have been of dismal quality, siting the last LP's released by the Beach Boys. These Rainbo pressings are a different story of very high quality. For awhile, Capitol was using RTI to press their LP's and they were superb.<br />The Rainbo pressed records can be identified on 7\\" 45's with an R-# and on 12\\" LP's, an S-# in the trail out section. This Beatles box is a good set to have but I would have preferred the U.K. pressings.<br /><br />For a completeist, this boxed set is a must-have. All the LP's are available separately, but if you are going to buy them all, you might as well buy the boxed set. Besides saving yourself a few bucks, you get the book and the box in addition.
0307341577|5.0|dark, disturbing, and delightful!<br /><br />such a refreshing change from all those light-hearted thrillers, gillian flynn sucked me in and make me a fan!  I loved this story, loved how the cast was unlikable likable, and how I never knew what to expect next.<br /><br />IF I COULD GIVE IT SIX STARS I WOULD!!!!!
B0041KVXLK|5.0|The 2012 release of Sgt. Peppers is the best re-release to date. As an owner of copies of the original Stereo & Mono U.S. Capitol Records LP's, an original Stereo Parlophone U.K., the U.K. BC-13 boxed set and now the 2012 re-release, the latest LP version is a must-have.<br /><br />There was a reason John Lennon said that the original MONO version of Sgt. Peppers was the best, because it is. The new 2012 STEREO LP is now the 2nd best version due to the care and quality that went into it's production, down to the locked-loop at the end of side 2.<br /><br />Breaking down the previous landmark versions of this LP is as follows:<br /><br />1. Original Capitol Stereo LP: The sound quality of the mix is bright and pure only<br />  marred by the poor quality of vinyl that Capitol was using at the time.<br /><br />2. Original Capitol MONO LP:  The sound is overall kind of muddy but it is evident<br />  that this is a noticeably mixdown and certain sounds pop out more prominently.<br />  Again,, this LP is marred by Capitol's poor quality of vinyl.<br /><br />3. Original Parlophone U.K. pressing: The sound is bright and pure, like the<br />  Capitol version and the sound quality is aided by a better quality of vinyl.<br />  This version includes the locked-loop ending of side 2. Of note is that there<br />  is unusual static that appears after \\"A Day In The Life\\" has faded out and<br />  before the locked-loop ending begins. I also noted this static in the two<br />  following Parlophone LP's also. Neither of the Capitol LP's had the locked-<br />  loop ending.<br /><br />4. Parlophone version from the BC-13 boxed set: The first thing that I noticed<br />  was that the left and right channels were swapped. Like instead of Paul's<br />  voice coming out of the left speaker, as originally intended, it is coming<br />  from the right speaker on this version. Of note, the locked-loop end of side<br />  two begins too early and also ends too early.<br /><br />5. 2012 Parlophonere-release: Phonically, it is not quite up to par with the<br />  original pressings and is a little dull. The high quality of vinyl used makes<br />  this version definitive. The left to right orientation is correct and the locked-<br />  loop ending is the best yet. Overall, there is very little surface noise and<br />  the static before the locked-loop ending is diminished.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|I know this is a book I have to read twice.  Once is for the stories it enfolds, but the second read is for the gorgeous lyricism of the prose.  Okay and maybe a third time to absorb all the various themes that are metaphors for what we encounter in living.  I'm so amazed at how someone takes words like this and spins them into such a rich tapestry of wonder.  I'm in awe.
B005HV6Y84|3.0|There are very few songs on this album that I felt really flowed with the theme of the movie. Which is completely opposite from the first three albums that I utterly adore. I felt this was choppy and could have used more creative music than Bruno Mars, yeesh. I'll stick with the first three over this one for a while.
1439152802|5.0|I fell in love with Kate Morton's work with the reading of The Forgotten Garden, her first book. Now I anxiously await each new book release. I think FG will always be my first love but this new novel is outstanding. Her descriptive writing style is so beautiful. It leaves me in awe as I read it. Her books have everything; love, intrigue, thriller, mystery and just a wonderful story. The endings are never predictable and always surprise me. Keep writing, Kate. You are a true talent.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I have this on a continuous loop in my car and I seriously can't get enough. I can't wait for her next album because her voice is so unique and the lyrics just stick to you like tar. I love it!

B009NOVCTM|5.0|This cd is a vast improvement over Forty Licks and is truly career spanning. This is the Greatest Hits cd we've all wanted for a long time now. But I've noticed in the reviews here that the songs are described as being in chronological order and this is simply not true. They are in relatively chronological groups but the order is not the order in which they were released. It would take up too much space to give examples, but very little of it is in truly chronological order. If you want to, look it up on Wikipedia or another music site. I'm not being a nit-picker here though it may seem so. Anybody who went wild for the Stones in 1964 and grew up with all these songs knows their real order and for many reasons would usually want to hear them that way. They (the label,not the group) came close this time but no cigar. The thing is the songs are on the right disc together; would it have been too much to arrange them correctly? And must there always be the \\"one missing song\\" on so many hits collections? Would it have been that impossible to include Mother's Little Helper ( and really, Lady Jane belongs here too). Was there no Summer of 1966? But at least they included the nearly lost and forgotten We Love You from the late summer of 1967. Oh well, at least it's the computer age and we can rearrange things. And despite my griping, it's The Stones in all their glory in one of the greatest careers in music history. Get it!
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|Great novel. Unbelievable writing. Just way too long.  Really enjoyed it for a while and honestly ended up skipping to the end.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Arguably the best hip hop album to come out of 2012, this is what one thinks of when an example of more that just bragging or \\"gangster\\" rap has to be made.  A true collection of conscience and gritty lyrics from one of the most interesting MC's to rise to fame this generation.<br /><br />If you're a fan of artists like Emminem, Lupe Fiasco, Dr. Dre, or the Black Hippy movement, like soulful production, or just ready for a breath of fresh air in a genre wrought with generality please, please, PLEASE buy this album.<br /><br />HiiiPower
1439152802|5.0|I eagerly awaited the arrival of Kate Morton's new book and was not disappointed.  Not only did this one keep me reading until midnight, it kept me awake after I turned out the light, going over details of the developments; this was especially true last night when I finished it.  I am always amazed at how this writer knows how much of the story needs to be revealed and when to reveal it to keep the reader engrossed.  As are her three previous books, this is a great read!

B0098VYCCE|4.0|Snow White & the Huntsman (this version) is not the tale you were told as a child. With taking the “dark side” into consideration, Snow White and The Huntsman was very well done. Cinematography, Acting, Direction and Plot all covered all the best they offered. I can see where it would win an academy award but knowing Hollywood it may not happen. 2 Thumbs up!
B003V1WXKU|4.0|enjoyed the observations and opinions of Mr. Feynman, book was easy read and enjoyable. He was surprisingly candid and opinionated
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I read the first in this series many years ago when it was first published.  Publicity about the tv series peaked my interest in returning to the books.  I am glad I waited. After rereading the first book, I was able to move to the next volume in the series without waiting for Mr Martin to write it. (Like most readers, I read much faster that authors write.) Each of these first three books has matched its predecessor in composition: rich plots, colorful writing, a nice meld of cultural references (historical and imagined) and Mr Martin does not shy away from the brutality of events and people of such a world as he has created.  One day I will watch the series.
B008OOYALE|3.0|For a free to play game it is fairly fun, with well done sprites, nice music and animations, as well as a fairly good amount of content, but the game constantly reminds you that its a free to play game through its obnoxious ads for its other games. At this point, whenever I log into the game, the game gives me no less than six advertisements before it even let's me begin to play, a few of which force you to click on the window and be taken to another screen, a process which is so processor heavy it will sometimes force close the game (forcing me to do it all again).<br /><br />The game has painfully slow progression compared to other games of this type, and so much of the content is just barely available to anyone who doesn't pay for it, and the price of many things actually scale up with you, meaning they never become more affordable.<br /><br />Lastly, the game is fairly buggy; there is a chunk of debris that cannot be cleared by anybody, and without fail, dragging an object to the edge of your territory will turn your whole map blue, forcing you to visit someone else's island to reload your own map.<br /><br />All in all, the game is fun, and I do log in to play every day, but it is starting to become more and more of a headache to do so.

0525958002|5.0|John Taylor opened his heart and soul for this autobiography.  He took us on his journey of discovery; from his humble beginnings through the reuniting of the band just a few years ago.  As a counselor, I appreciated his honesty and identification of his emotional needs that were previously met through not so beneficial means.  I am thrilled he has found sobriety and love for himself, his family and all of us fans. As a fan, the book took me back through my adolescents and many of my memories of following Duran Duran through the years.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|First of all, headphone amp performance is highly dependent upon the headphones in use.  No amp review is complete without stating what headphones you listen with.  I use Grado SR80.  These are 32 ohm headphones, which makes them easy to drive with just about any source device.<br /><br />I listened to a variety of mp3 and FLAC music (rock, electronic, acoustic, jazz) through foobar with all effects and EQ turned off.  For comparison, I switched back and forth between the E17 and the default soundcard in a Dell desktop machine.  Oddly enough, the Dell soundcard is my benchmark - in previous comparisons I found no difference at all between the Dell and a Nuforce UDAC-2, and the Dell is much better than a Creative X-Fi USB DAC/amp I bought on the cheap.  Having been unimpressed with other headphone amps I've tried, what I really wanted to get was the highly regarded, open source design Objective Desktop Amp (ODA), but this would have cost nearly three times as much as the E17 and lacks many of the E17's useful features and inputs.<br /><br />Differences in sound between the E17 and the Dell are minimal.  My first impression was that the E17 was a bit warmer and a bit more veiled than the Dell, but more careful volume matching between the two devices eliminated that perceived difference.  After listening to quite a lot of music on both devices, I can't decisively say that I hear any difference between the two.  That's certainly not to say that the E17 isn't good, but unless there are noticeable problems with your current sound setup, the E17 might not make any audible improvement.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I'm planning to keep the E17.  It will replace the inferior Creative X-Fi as my home headphone amp, and I also plan to use its SPDIF inputs to listen to audio from my PS3, DVD player, and CD player.  That kind of versatility is hard to beat at this price.<br /><br />As a final note, I'm sure some people will assume my ears just don't work right since I didn't hear differences between the E17 and a stock soundcard.  I don't claim to have golden ears, but I know what well-recorded and well-reproduced music should sound like, and I do my best to eliminate as many sources of bias as possible when listening.  Plenty of research literature exists showing that people are not nearly as sensitive to different audio components as they believe they are, so it's important to take all hype and fawning reviews with a grain of salt.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have since also purchased an O2/ODAC combo and have to say that with relatively low impedance headphones that the E17 sounds just as good as the O2.  The E17 seems to sound just a touch warmer than the O2, which actually complements Grado headphones nicely.

0525952926|4.0|Another blockbuster work of historical fiction by Ken Follett. It's not as strong as his books set on the cusp of the Renaissance, even the World War I prequel, but it's still a greatly entertaining book.<br /><br />The two weaknesses over which I will cavil are: 1. There are a couple unbelievably convenient coincidences that solved plot problems. The most notable, without giving too much away, is how a certain English airman meets his death and to whom his last words are spoken. 2. A few of the minor characters are just too stock. Examples: the sadistic NKVD officer, the beautiful and alluring Spanish resistance fighter, and even Boy, the dissolute English aristocrat.<br /><br />However, the history and fiction are masterfully woven. The important characters are for the most part interesting, sympathetic, and human. For example, Lloyd is a boxer who wants to rid the world of Fascism. On the one hand he's willing to fight and die, but believes in, despite all the evidence to the contrary that humans are basically good and reasoned argument will prevail. Daisy is a self-absorbed socialite who grows into a committed humanitarian ambulance driver and political wife. Within a pop genre Follett's characters have depth and negotiate difficult transformations. Just keeping track of all the characters in the ensemble caste would be a challenge for lesser writers. Follett cuts back and forth among the characters, across time zones, and battle fronts. He brilliantly captures the great sweep of World War II by tracing out the development of his many characters.<br /><br />Follett did skip the African theater, but took us from the Spanish Civil War to the German build up, the American reluctance, Pearl Harbor, the European theater, Russian Front, back to the Pacific Theater, and post war response on three continents. His last book was \\"Giant\\", but this one too is huge. [[ASIN:B007TAF1JY MONSTERS OF THE MIDWAY The Death, Resurrection, and Redemption of Chicago Football]]

0525958002|4.0|In the Pleasure Groove is a quick read and as a fan of Duran Duran, I especally enjoyed the chapters on the band's early history and rise to fame.  Taylor's writing is judiciously edited and doesn't ramble on, and the story of his life reads like the transcript of a conversation with a friend. The pictures are fun. If you were a teenage girl in the 1980s with Duran Duran posters all over your walls, this is a must read that will allow you to see the heros of your youth not as untouchable idols but as normal young people who suddenly got famous but still had to deal with the realities of their lives and families.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Catching fire sets the expectations too high for the ending of the trilogy. The war of the Mocking Jay should have been a whole trilogy standing on its own but the fast pace of the action is definitely a high point on entertainment and cliffhanging on the series. Even though I'm not a chick, I would have loved to see a bit more of the relationships explored in the book. The ending definitely seems rushed and makes you refuse to believe it. Having said that, I definitely recommend it. The hunger games was a great run.

B003O86FMW|5.0|A book that takes the bet that the hunger games makes and doubles on it. The fantasy in it takes giant leaps into a crazy arena with difficult to forget rivals, even more so than on the original. The relationship between Peeta, Haymitch and Katniss is at it's peak. The author truly takes the novel to the next level.
B001DJLD1M|3.0|The following is a guide from the International Movie Data Base.  As you can readily see, the ratings go down for each sequel.  I found that I had to agree as I watched them in one marathon.<br /><br />The Matrix - IMDB rating = 8.7.  Thomas A. Anderson is a man living two lives. By day he is an average computer programmer and by night a hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and electrochemical energy and who imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion<br /><br />The Matrix Reloaded - IMDB rating = 7.1.  6 months after the events depicted in The Matrix, Neo has proved to be a good omen for the free humans, as more and more humans are being freed from the matrix and brought to Zion, the one and only stronghold of the Resistance. Neo himself has discovered his superpowers including super speed, ability to see the codes of the things inside the matrix and a certain degree of pre-cognition. But a nasty piece of news hits the human resistance: 250,000 machine sentinels are digging to Zion and would reach them in 72 hours. As Zion prepares for the ultimate war, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are advised by the Oracle to find the Keymaker who would help them reach the Source. Meanwhile Neo's recurrent dreams depicting Trinity's death have got him worried and as if it was not enough, Agent Smith has somehow escaped deletion, has become more powerful than before and has fixed Neo as his next target<br /><br />The Matrix Revolutions - IMDB rating = 6.6.  Neo discovers that somehow he is able to use his powers in the real world too and that his mind can be freed from his body, as a result of which he finds himself trapped on a train station between the Matrix and the Real World. Meanwhile, Zion is preparing for the oncoming war with the machines with very little chances of survival. Neo's associates set out to free him from The Merovingian since it's believed that he is the One who will end the war between humans and the machines. What they do not know is that there is a threat from a third party, someone who has plans to destroy both the worlds.<br /><br />The Animatrix - IMDB rating = 7.3.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved the way this book takes you places that merge reality with fantasy and makes you live difficult to imagine situations. It has been my come back to novel reading this year and I'm lucky to have picked the hunger games trilogy.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This game is simple yet beautiful. If you are on the fence about buying this, I suggest you buy it.
B009GESJH2|5.0|So, two years after his Rick Rubin produced album \\"Born Free\\", Kid Rock is back with his new album \\"Rebel Soul.\\" This time though things are different, there's no big name producer on board (Kid Rock produced this one himself) and things got a little less serious. I am going to review the album track-by-track based on several listening from start to finish. Just a quick word about me, I'm a huge Kid Rock fan and run the website Extreme Kid Rock (google it, it's the biggest Kid Rock fansite on the net).<br /><br />Track #1 \\"Chickens In The Pen\\": This is great way to start the album and sets the tone for what's to come. The song is upbeat, melodic and makes you want to get up and dance. A great fun rock n roll song to kick start the album.<br />My rating: 8.5 /10<br /><br />Track #2 \\"Let's Ride\\": This is Kid Rock's anthem for the troops and first single from the album. I've listened to this song countless times over the past couple of months, and I like it. The guitar work on this song is awesome and is definitely a song you can rock out to. One of the more serious songs on the album.<br />My rating: 8 /10<br /><br />Track #3 \\"3 CATT Boogie\\": When this song kicks in it has an incredible groove that just makes you want to dance. It's impossible to play this song all the way through without shaking your hips to it, it's the perfect party song. Kid Rock's voice sounds great on this also. A really fun song that was instantly one of my favorites on the record.<br />My rating: 9 /10<br /><br />Track #4 \\"Detroit, Michigan\\": Kid Rock has always given shout-outs to Detroit on his past records, however on \\"Rebel Soul\\" he goes one step further and dedicates a song to his hometown. On this song Kid Rock gives props to many legends that the Motor City has produced including Marvin Gaye, The Supremes and Eminem. This song is full of soul but a little too cheesy for me and probably the weakest song on the album.<br />My rating: 7 /10<br /><br />Track #5 \\"Rebel Soul\\": Not really gota lot to say about the title track, but definitely one of my favorites on the album. I'm a big fan of the lyrics of this song and find myself singing along to them.<br />My rating: 9 /10<br /><br />Track #6 \\"God Save Rock N Roll\\": Kid Rock has said that this is the song he will play when he is inducted into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. It's a foot-tapping country rocker. Solid song.<br />My rating: 8 /10<br /><br />Track #7 \\"Happy New Year\\": This is Kid Rock's third cover of a John Eddie a song and definitely my favorite of the 3 (the other 2 being \\"Lowlife\\" and \\"Forty\\"). A great pick-up song that I can imagine being played in bars across the country during the Christmas/New Year season.<br />My rating: 8.5 /10<br /><br />Track #8 \\"Celebrate\\": This one is a flat out rock n roll song. I really like how the song breaks down in the middle and then comes back with some awesome guitar. It's a decent track but I'd say one of the weaker songs on the album.<br />My rating: 7.5 /10<br /><br />Track #9 \\"The Mirror\\": This one is a really dark ballad that builds up gradually throughout the song. The verses feature pretty heavy autotune and echo effects. Very different to anything Kid Rock has ever done before, one of the stand-outs on the record.<br />My rating: 9 /10<br /><br />Track #10 \\"Mr Rock N Roll\\": As you may gather from the title of the track this one is a rock `n' roll song. It's the longest track on the album at 6 mins 37 secs, part of the reason for this is the minute and half section in the middle where the song changes completely and goes very country before returning to rock n roll. A really good rock n roller!<br />My rating: 8 /10<br /><br />Track #11 \\"Cucci Galore\\": This is a song Kid Rock has had lying around for a while and certainly wouldn't have fit on \\"Born Free\\", however the song is right at home on this record. Kid Rock describes this song as \\"1998 Kid Rock\\" which is a pretty fair description as it is much more reminiscent of early Kid Rock rather thanhis work as of late. This title is a play on words of the character \\"Pussy Galore\\" from the James Bond film \\"Goldfinger\\" and I have the feeling this song may just surpass \\"So Hott\\" as the Kid Rock song most suited for strip clubs. \\"Cucci Galore\\" is pretty good but not my favorite on the record. I know a lot of fans with LOVE this one though.<br />My rating: 8 /10<br /><br />Track #12 \\"Redneck Paradise\\": Fans of Kid Rock will most likely have heard the story behind this song, how the Young Brothers, Eric & Jason, wrote the song and then sent their demo to Kid Rock suspended inside a railroad freight box they had built themselves out of $200 timber which they had invested all of their final pay check it. The plan worked and 5 years after writing the song here it is on \\"Rebel Soul\\". Kid Rock kept everything from the Young Brothers version of the song and added to it, making it his own. The end product is an awesome country song with an infectious chorus that will no doubt be the anthem of the annual Kid Rock Cruise for years to come. I can see potential in this song possibly being a hit on country radio.<br />My rating: 9 /10<br /><br />Track #13 \\"Cocaine & Gin\\": This song is a slow country ballad. It's alright, nothing special though.<br />My rating: 7.5 /10<br /><br />Track #14 \\"Midnight Ferry\\": Kid Rock has said this is the song he would want played at his funeral although it is actually pretty upbeat. The song features gospel undertones and some bluesy guitar. Really good song, one of my favourites on the record and a great way to bring the album to a close.<br />My rating: 9 /10<br /><br />Overall I would say I was blown away by this album. Kid Rock got back to having fun on this record and it's a formula that works perfectly for him. Kid Rock has a reputation for making records that cross many genres and boundaries and this one is no different, there are songs on this album to keep every type of Kid Rock fan happy. Some fans may be disappointed that there is norap on this album, however it is no longer 1998, Kid Rock has moved on and matured as an artist. As for where this ranks compared to the rest of Kid Rock's catalog, I would say it's up there with his best. Make no mistake people, especially those that doubted him after \\"Born Free\\", Kid Rock is back!<br /><br />John (Extreme Kid Rock)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Patterson is almost always excellent  I really liked this one and as usual was not disappointed  I highly recommend The Racketeer
B0071XO8RA|5.0|WOOL Omnibus kept popping up on my recommendations list and I disregarded it for several weeks thinking to myself...wool is rough and itchy, it makes me scratch,my skin red....I don't like wool...I'm not reading THAT book. The odd thing is that I am an artist and a naturally curious person so in most cases an odd one word title would draw me in enough to read summaries and reviews. However, in the case of wool it was my own bias toward the insufferable childhood trauma of wearing wool sweaters four months out of the year that held me back from what has turned out to be a real treasure to me. A book I will spend many hours thinking about, talking to others about and wondering what in the hell would I have done? It had so many elements that I love beyond the overall sci fi genre. Drama, action-adventure, psychological thriller a decent helping of horror and a dash of romance blend it all together with an incredible imagination that captures a future that is not completely UNimaginable...WOOL; it is all I hope and dream a book to be.<br /><br />\\"Never judge a book by it's cover,\\" or title apparently in this case because when I finally gave in to the rave reviews and purchased this book not only was it a lesson to me but also a great gift. Well, make that five gifts because each installment was like being a child again at my own birthday party and each gift I opened was just as exciting or even more than the one before.<br /><br />**Possible Spoilers**<br /> The psychology between the characters and look at human nature in its rawest form was fantastic and had me thinking of 'Collective Consciousness'. Mostly though, it was just such a mind boggling scenario of events that I truly could not stand not knowing what would happen next...like sneak reading my kindle at work and thinking or daydreaming about it the rest of the day. I was fascinated with the creep factor because Howey described everything so well that I could see it,feel it, taste it and unfortunately sometimes smell it all in my minds eye as I read. I felt the cold, damp 'down deep', the heat in the suit, the darkness, the fear,the thirst and hunger. I tasted the rust and that funk water & felt my muscles burning from all of those damn stairs, stairs, stairs. And air, lungs burning for air!><br /><br />I was especially drawn to \\"The Unraveling\\" [[ASIN:1468132334 Wool 4: The Unraveling]]simply because of my love of 'Romeo and Juliette'. I love the way Howey intertwined the story with the quotes from the play...it was like delicious icing for a cake that could have easily stood alone, together it was heavenly.<br /><br />This is my first review after reading close to 200 books on kindle, that says a lot. That is a terrible habit I would like to remedy #to review all books# and this was a great incentive.
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie.  Have wanted it for a while and just never got around to picking it up but watched the movie every year on TV.  So much better to watch as a movie.  It funny and they all play their parts so well.<br />Great Movie!

1439156816|5.0|If you're a new author or aspiring author, this is a MUST READ. Why? Because Mr. King reveals the mindset that helped him developed awesome books like The Dead Zone, Carrie and The Green Mile. Before reading this book I assumed authors wrote books off plot outlines, but instead Stephen reveals that he dives right into a \\"situation\\" and then \\"discovers\\" that situation as he writes the story. Even he doesn't know what's going to happen at the end.<br /><br />Awesome. Five stars.

B00628RVV0|4.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a movie that starts out with an 8 year boy named Bruno. Bruno's family was living in Berlin during WWII. While Bruno and his 13 year old sister go to school, their father is a high ranking soldier in the Nazi army. As time goes on, Bruno's father gets a promotion and is forced to move to German countryside. As the family moves into their new house, Bruno is informed that he is to be confined in the small fenced area surrounding their house. As life calms down, from his window, Bruno sees what he believes to be a farm with a chimney which occasionally flares black smoke into the air. Bruno confronts his parent asking why everyone is wearing striped pajamas on the farm he can see from his window. Covering the truth, his parents say they don't know. Eventually curiosity overpowers Bruno as he heads out into the back yard to explore the farm. Bruno approaches the fence and we learn the so called farm is actually a concentration camp. Behind the fence Bruno meets an eight year old boy Jewish boy named Shmuel. As the story progresses, these two become friends and Bruno sneaks out every spare chance he has to meet his friend.<br /><br />The positive<br />This was an interesting movie because of a few factors. Rather than being another story of a Jewish family undergoing WWII; this movie demonstrates the difficulties of a German family during the same period. The story was well planned out and made you think. The acting was good and made you want to see what was going to happen next.<br /><br />The Negative<br />What I didn't like were some segments in the movie. The beginning was slow and only got to the point in the middle of the movie. A lot of scenes where dragged out too long. By this I mean that there were a lot of parts where you sat down and told yourself \\"well\\". Scenes lasted for minutes when the boys just sat down and looked at each other saying only a few words.<br /><br />Overall this was a good movie to watch. It not only showsthe perspective of the Jews but also the perspective of the Germans. In this story, Bruno is acting as humanity ignoring the evil right before his eyes. Many non - Jews during the Holocaust acted like Bruno ignoring the wicked truth that was displayed in front of them.
0060512806|2.0|[WARNING]  Spoilers in the 3rd paragraph...<br /><br />Well, after more than 10 years, I've finally made it through Cryptonomicon.  I bought it when it first came out on the recommendation of some IT geeks I was trying to relate to.  As it turns out, I guess I'm not really a geek after all.  I find that my interests are much more grounded in reality and in the larger questions in life, not in the descriptions of arcane mathematical minutiae.<br /><br />I believe the author has attempted a grand work, but the major plot points are woefully under developed.  Most of the book is spent describing in painstaking detail, the inner workings of organs, mathematical formulas, descriptions of masturbatory intervals as applied to mathematics, and advanced cryptology.  The author spends all of his time describing the inane details of meaningless drivel while leaving the reader to infer major plot shifts.  One minute, we are in Australia while a character is playing the organ in such a way as to impress a girl so he can get laid and stop thinking of masturbation, the next, we are back to the present while the \\"future\\" character also ponders whether to masturbate or not.  We don't go back to the past for another 150 pages or so and we find out the older character apparently got laid and is now getting married.<br /><br />The book spends an inordinate amount of time talking about a data haven in a a fictional place in the middle of the Pacific.  As it turns out, we never even see the data haven completed.  Why did he spend so much time working on the data haven only to lead us back to the Philippines?  Boring and frustrating.  There were only two really good characters in the book:  Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and Bobby Shaftoe.  Randy Waterhouse is an introverted weak nerd who spends the entire novel thinking only of himself.  I got so tired every time we were thrust into the present day and had to listen to that character complain about this or that.  He's a sniveling little SWPL that wouldn't survive except for the accoutrements that accompany modern life.  Can't believe this was the main character in the book.<br /><br />I think only a certain type of person will love this kind of writing.  It reminds me of the ridiculous digressions that Tolkein was also famous for.  I must have spent 40 or 50 pages reading about Tom Bombadil in Lord of the Rings.  Another 40 or 50 pages of Elvish poems or songs or whatever.  These authors write a plot so that they can spend the rest of the time describing this fantasy world that few can relate to.  It's like George Lucas' critics also say he only created Star Wars so that he could talk about all these cool space alien characters.  The story is incidental.  The scenery is what is important.<br /><br />I started and stopped this book for years because I just couldn't relate to any of the characters.  They weren't plumbing any moral questions.  They weren't affecting the world in any recognizable way (except for Lawrence Waterhouse, I did like his character so I gave this book 2 stars instead of just one).  Shaftoe was also a welcome relief from the tedium.<br /><br />I got the feeling that this author is impressed with his own cleverness.  He condescends to the reader in that smarmy kind of sneering way where he pretends to like you, but is secretly making fun of you because he thinks he's smarter than you are.  He's the kind of guy that when you had a real conversation with him, you'd end up just punching him in the mouth because he was being a condescending little jerk and didn't think you'd actually hit him for the terrible things he was saying to you.  Yeah, I don't really like this style of writing.<br /><br />A lot of people will disagree with me as is obvious from the majority of good reviews on this site, but that's ok.  I have a hard time getting into some science fiction and this was one of those books.  At the end of the day, I'm just not one of those in the true geek crowd.  I'm not a gamer.  I don't play WoW.  I never really understood the fascination with Dungeons and Dragons, Magic, or Fantasy Football.  But there is a sizable portion of the population that does.  This book is for them.<br /><br />If you like pages and pages of descriptions about cryptography; if you like to jump from World War 2 to present day and back again with hundreds of pages in between; if you like more detail in the arcane than in the actual plot; if you enjoy shallow discussions of masturbation, homosexuality, pipe organs, submarines, zeta functions, one day crypto pads, and overly verbose descriptions of environments, then please read this book.  If you are looking for a more sweeping novel that involves the reader instead of talking down to him, then look elsewhere.  There are much more capable authors in the sci-fi genre that take you into their world instead of sneering at you from above it.  I hated the book and I'm glad I'm done with it.
B0091Q82L8|2.0|As a tremendous Who fan, I had to get another CD with Keith Moon that has not been previously released.  I must, however, disagree with the glowing reviews of Hull.  The recording does not seems as crisp as Leeds and the bass is truly difficult to hear.  The arrangements, drumming, bass and guitar are much better on Leeds. The band also seems more energized on Leeds.<br /><br />If you already own \\"Live at Leeds\\", there is clearly no need to get Hull.  If you have neither, get Leeds!!!!!

0321356683|5.0|Java is a very powerful language which allows one to program in many different ways. Bloch describes why these features were designed and how to use them properly based on the years of experience he's had with the language.<br /><br />The book is very well organized and goes into each item with the perfect amount of detail: not too much, not too little. The items on Generics, Enums, and Concurrency in particular were very enlightening for me.<br /><br />Simply put, if you are a Java developer this is a must-read.

B009E3EYS8|4.0|Music: 4.5 stars; Performances: 5 stars; Movie: 4 stars<br /><br />I saw the movie in a theatre last week here in Cincinnati. The movie was being shown \\"one night only\\" across theatres in the US, in anticipation of the DVD/CD combo release. First as to the music, it is stellar of course, and I enjoyed the first hour of the movie more than the second hour, due to its inclusion of some latter-day and/or not-so-obvious Led Zep tunes, in particular \\"In My Time of Dying\\", and even more so \\"For Your Life\\", one of my all time favorite Zep tracks (and one which Robert Plant announced as one they had never played live before), and \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\", equally stellar. The second hour of the show concentrates more on the 'greatest hits'. While I really enjoyed \\"Dazed and Confused\\", I was somewhat disappointed that is was only an 11 min. version (dare I say \\"mini-version\\"?) of the legendary and much longer live versions we've heard in earlier days. I know that the band HAD to play \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" but if they never play it again, it'll be too soon for me, I just have been over-exposed to it over the many years (Led Zep's equivalent of Pink Floyd's \\"Money\\"). \\"Kashmir\\" was another outstanding \\"newbie\\". I rate the music selection 4.5 stars.<br /><br />As to the performances, what can you say. They are simply jaw-dropping. Jimmy Page (age 63 at the time) still has the licks, and then some. I just marveled how he got those incredible sounds from his guitar. Robert Plant has preserved his voice in a very nice way. John Paul Jones played a surprising amount of songs on the keyboards, but his work on the bass remains outstanding. There was one song (can't remember which one) in which he played the 8 string bass guitar, and I just wished the camera would've stayed on him more during that song. And Jason Bonham did more than well, sitting in for his dad. The performances are 5 stars.<br /><br />Finally as to the movie itself, it was a great experience in the theatre, with the full sound in a theatre (I don't care how good your set-up at home is, it can never match the theatre sound). It was really too bad that the editing of the movie is so herky-jerky, with camera angles moving almost every second. I just wished the movie angle would stay put for a bit and let me enjoy, but that hardly ever happened. And what is with the frequent shots of the video screens? I mean, do you really want to see that instead of the band itself? I rate the movie editing 4 stars.<br /><br />That said, it was a great experience to see the 2007 \\"Celebration Day\\" concert in the theatre last week. I will buy this set for the CDs, as I doubt that I will play the DVD much at home, now having seen the movie in the theatre. As an aside, I had the good fortune of catching Led Zeppelin once in concert, on the 1980 European Spring tour, sadly only months before John Bonham would pass away. What an incredible evening that was. And as \\"Celebration Day\\" proves (once again), the music of Led Zeppelin will live on forever!full sound in a theatre (I don't care how good your set-up at home is, it can never match the theatre sound).

B000HT3PPG|5.0|All the purist noise about \\"the abomination of colorization\\" notwithstanding, I bought this one FOR that version--I already have the b&w-only version, so since this repackaging also includes that one as well, I guess I now have a duplicate. In the colorized version, it looks like they overcompensated with the software to avoid making colors too garish, so Edmund Gwenn's Santa suit isn't very red. Plus, the taxicabs you see in the beginning as an out-of-uniform Kringle walks down Fifth Avenue aren't the bright school-bus-yellow you expect on a cab. But we do get to see a green Christmas tree with colored ornaments in the scene towards the end at the Senior home. And when Kringle tries to blow bubbles with the bubblegum he \\"mooches\\" off Susan, we get to see the resulting pink shreds in his beard. I guess bubblegum was pink as far back as right after World War II. One scene that was only in the book until I watched the \\"third version\\"--the 20th Century Fox 46-minute TV special tucked away in the extras on disc 2--and saw it there. That's the humorous scene where mean-spirited intellectual snob psychologist Sawyer gives a \\"debunking-Santa\\" lecture, all the while Kringle is peeking around corners and making ironic faces as the audience breaks up laughing and Sawyer doesn't even know he's there. I know that the above evidence as \\"pro\\" arguments seem flimsy up against the CSX freight train load of \\"con\\" arguments from anti-colorization purists/ naysayers, but reality check, time out--the colorized version is AVAILABLE, I BOUGHT it and in our society, that's all the justification I need. I'm a CUSTOMER, a VIEWER--part of the AUDIENCE, capisce? In entertainment, non-fans, \\"boo birds\\", haters and other naysayers don't matter--the REAL AUDIENCE does.<br /><br />Other reviewers have dealt with the principal actors Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn and child actress Natalie Wood as well or better than I could, so it's pointless for me to duplicate their efforts. But one supporting player--William Frawley as Judge Harper's political advisor whose cigar is a multi-purpose prop--is a familiar face to me. Part of my childhood TV viewing included \\"I Love Lucy\\", with Frawley co-starring as Lucy and Ricky's downstairs landlord Fred Mertz. I'm sure when Frawley played the Judge's advisor in this film, he never envisioned tenants \\"entertaining\\" him with live band versions coming from upstairs of \\"The Mexican Hat Dance\\", re-badged \\"El Breako the Leaso\\" a handful of years later.upporting player--William Frawley as Judge Harper's political advisor whose cigar is a multi-purpose prop--is a familiar face to me.

B0083P1QUM|3.0|This is the first book I read by Patricia Cornwell.  I found the story interesting, however I found the writing a bit difficult to follow.  She writes as though her thoughts are scattered.  I had to keep rereading to figure out which character was speaking when reading the dialogue.  It was a light, interesting mystery, and an otherwise easy read.
0316228532|4.0|I really liked the book.  I think Rowling did a good job fleshing out her characters and resisting the usual \\"happy ending\\".<br /><br />The book held my interest in telling a good story and I look forward to her future endeavors since she has shown that she is capable of writing beyond the \\"Potter\\" genre.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I'm not sure if I enjoyed this story!  I had to keep on reading, I wanted to know what was going on.  In that way, the story was compelling.  By the end, I was a little let down.  It was an odd ending.

Really enjoy this game because it gives your brain some exercise. The last 2 levels were pretty challenging. :) Highly recommend!
B007KOYEOC|1.0|I am a bit over it by now....Do like the story line but the sex every couple of pages is just boring......Not a great fan at all....
B008D28HYS|5.0|I started with the original (non-color) version and used it to kill many hours.  When this became available, I jumped on it and liked it even more than the first one.  Since I have both, no ads pop up.  Aside from a couple of minor appearence glitches and an occasional resizing when I was trying to fill some spaces, the quality is top notch.<br /><br />The puzzles are challenging but with few exceptions, quite doable with patience.  No matter what new games I try, I keep coming back to this one.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|As with all Jo Nesbo novels, The Bat in particular was well written, very accurate (from an australian's point of view),and as usual a roller-coaster ride from the first chapter!<br />This novel also gives an insight into Harry Hole, proir to subsequent novels.<br />I can't wait for the release of Harry Hole 2!

B0067AC5KA|5.0|Stieg Larsson should go down in literary history for his incredible plot construction, character development, literary style, and master genius
B00887490Y|4.0|The Tall Man (Pascal Laugier, 2012)<br /><br />The first thing to know about The Tall Man, the third feature from French wunderkind Pascal Laugier, is that unlike his first two films, it is not in any way a horror movie. I was as shocked by this as everyone else seems to have been, but then upon reflection it's not outside the realm of the probable; Laugier's first two features, while both superlative, were about as diametrically opposed as it's possible to be and still both be horror films (Saint Ange is a stylish, lushly-shot haunted-asylum picture, while Martyrs is a claustrophobic torture porn film with a studied absence of atmosphere). Unfortunately, it has been marketed as such, probably to cash in on Laugier's name, so a lot of people have been a lot more disappointed in this than they should have been had it been marketed as the mystery/thriller that it is. That said, it's not up to par with Laugier's earlier movies, but that's a relative thing; it's still better than at least 85% of what you will see this year. Laugier, after all, set his own bar very, very high over the past decade.<br /><br />Plot: Julia Denning (Blade: Trinity's Jessica Biel) runs a free clinic in the economically devastated mining town of  Cold Rock, Washington. She lives in a big, rambling house with her son David (Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules' Jakob Davies); her husband, as pretty much everyone who comes into contact with her during the opening half of the film lets us know, died at some point in the past, and the townsfolk are still measuring her up, not sure she can fill the shoes left by her husband--the town doctor. That's just one small drama in a town that has an overarching problem--the Tall Man, an urban legend-style figure who has abducted dozens of children and who supposedly lives in the abandoned mines.<br /><br />And that's all the more I can tell you, because exactly halfway through this movie, you are likely to shout \\"LAUGIER, YOU BASTARD!\\" at the screen and throw popcorn. Which, I rush to add, is in no way a bad thing, especially because the Big Reveal(TM) is then followed by the next ten or twenty minutes making you question whether you actually heard what you thought you heard, or whether the character who said it was simply trying to humor a psychopath, or... what. And even once that question is resolved, well, there are a lot more layers to this onion.<br /><br />All of this is not to say the movie doesn't have its flaws, though they are minor, if really annoying; this was Laugier's first picture solely in English, and there are some places where it would have been a great idea for Laugier (who also wrote the script) to hire a consultant equally fluent in French and English to help with the translation; there are places where the language simply doesn't flow in the way it does in his earlier pictures (and language is a very important part of all of them). Especially in the first montage--but I'm getting ahead of myself (though not far).<br /><br />We're getting well out of review territory here, but lemme tell you: if you're going to \\"get\\" this movie, at least in the sense of Laugier's filmic language, I will (briefly) break down the first four sequences for you, because they encapsulate everything I love about this guy and this movie.<br /><br />The first scene doesn't require any trickery. You put Stephen McHattie and William B. Davis on the screen together and I'm amazed cinemas don't implode with that much talent in that small a space.<br /><br />Then comes the second sequence, where we're introduced to both Jessica Biel's character and that of her sidekick/wannabe pal Jenny (Jodelle Ferland from the Twilight franchise). Jenny's sister is being rushed to the free clinic because she's in labor, and there's all sorts of small-town drama surrounding that that we get into that does a pretty good job of setting up the town itself, but that's secondary here. The baby is born not breathing, and Jenny and her mother wheelthe confused new mother out of the delivery room (which is actually a classroom in an old schoolhouse, and how's that for the small things?). The door closes and we see the rest of the scene through that frosted glass that was in your principal's window. Which, in the language film film, is the same as \\"let's show the naked chick taking a shower, but without actually giving the audience what they're really looking for.\\" It's a tease, but here it's applied to Julia Denning attempting to save the life of a newborn baby. Now, pause for a moment and think about the way this scene is set up--Laugier, very deliberately, has taken a setting that screams \\"this is cheesecake\\" and given it life-or-death implications. As well, when it's a naked-girl-in-the-shower picture, unless it's one that's going to come equipped with a soundtrack heavy on the wah-wah pedal, the only sound you hear is...the shower (and maybe the killer's knife clicking against the tiles). Here, you've got Julia begging this baby to breathe, and for the love of pete. It's one of the best-constructed sequences I can remember seeing in a movie in recent memory.<br /><br />Third sequence is the first half of the main title. It's inventive but nothing we haven't seen before (Laugier borrowed a bit from the way Fringe does place names, but of course put his own spin on it).<br /><br />Fourth is how we get introduced to the Tall Man urban legend--through a montage of news footage. Seriously, I can hear you groaning through the screen, but bear with me here. First off is the attention to detail--there's that \\"small things\\" argument again (and if I kept doing this, you'd hear it a lot). Melodrama directors will attempt something like this and then fade it into some godawful tear-jerking sequence of a fake-sympathetic new reporter nodding and looking sage while interviewing the latest victim's parents. Which saves on budget because you're no longer having artists create fake news graphics, you can stop casting all those extras, etc. But no--Laugier takes that sequence out to its logical conclusion, and it's masterful. I'm even willing to forgive him the whole \\"kids vanishing in a puff of smoke\\" trope, which he takes far too literally here (it's repeated later in the film to much, much greater effect, which also gets him a pass).<br /><br />If you look at scenes like that and say \\"hey, this is a director who knows what he's doing,\\" I can guarantee you a good time with this flick, as long as you remember that this is not the horror movie the trailers tried to sell you. It is something very different, and it is the better for that. *** ½the confused new mother out of the delivery room (which is actually a classroom in an old schoolhouse, and how's that for the small things?).

B003Y6EL5W|3.0|We were expecting a light hearted funny movie that possibly met the humor of a SuperBad. What we saw was  a pretty dark and somewhat intense movie that was pretty entertaining. I ended up really enjoying it anyway. My wife on the other hand didn't appreciate it. Over all the acting was pretty good and worth a night at home...

B000059ZLH|3.0|I love DT. This album converted me about a year ago and couldn't wait to see it live. The sound is great and it's fun watching the guys' talent showcased. Unfortunately, the video editing was about 10 years behind its time and was distracting to the performance which has kept me from watching it a 2nd time. Note to all live music show directors: Don't try and be artful! The art is there in front of you, frame it in high quality video and let the viewer enjoy :) 3 stars only.

I am personally greatful to her because I have always wondered why I was much different than others but could never figure out why.  It helped me to &#34;reframe&#34; my past as well as my present.  Her research is based on years of experience and I highly suggest this read to those who even think they know of someone like this or believe they are HSP's.  Wonderful!

She alternates between a Brandi Carlisle and, well, I don't know, that sultry sexy deep lower keys that I find hard to compare. I got to listening to what I would call alternative rock, easy to listen to, when suddenly she blew me away.<br />Anyone over the age of 60 (like me) will know what I am talking about, should they listen to the album in its entirety. She'll catch you up when you least expect it!

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|*Spoiler Alert*<br /> The Avengers is a behemoth of action that comic nerds and casual movie-goers alike can enjoy in the same vein. It's not only action packed, but the humor, and the script altogether, was well written and compliments each character completely. For example, Captain America speaks like how you would think: a bit dated, not exactly knowing much of his surroundings yet. He speaks as anybody who just woke up from being frozen for seventy odd years. Bruce Banner, also known as The Hulk, speaks in a sort of timid, nervous way. He mumbles a bit, and is constantly scared that something will happen that makes him very, very angry. Mark Ruffalo, the actor who plays Banner/Hulk, pulls this off gracefully as he truly is Bruce, and not just an actor playing him. Brilliant performances from the cast are a major driving point for this movie. Tony Stark is as sarcastic and witty as he normally is. Thor is awkward with his mythos and his stories of battles and what-not. In fact, Thor would be the only character that sort of didn't mesh in with the rest of the team. The actor who played him, Chris Hemsworth, didn't convince me that he was actually the character he was playing like everyone else did. Even though Thor was powerful and awesome, the actor who played him was a hit and miss for me.<br /> More praises aside for the other actors, the action of this movie raises the bar for how a superhero movie should be made. Explosions, gun fights, jets, super powers, and martial arts can make for a summer blockbuster if done right. The Avengers is done right. They do a good job in accurately showing each characters different abilities and strength levels (in the fight between Iron Man and Thor, Thor is clearly shown be stronger than Iron Man's armor, but Iron Man's repulsors are shown be as powerful as they are in the comics, knocking Thor off of his feet). Hulk is portrayed as the unstoppable beast that he is, utterly destroying everything in his path as he fights thealien antagonists of the movie. He even pummels Loki, and to a much lesser extent, Thor, who were both worshipped as gods at one point. Captain America, Black Widow, and Hawkeye are shown to be proficient in martial arts and that shows that normal people can be a super hero too.<br /> The editing of the movie, along with the plot, action, special effects, and the pop culture references, make this movie out to be one of my genuine favorites. Being a comic book fan, I am truly pleased with this movie and I'm very excited for the future of Marvel Studios.

0812984412|4.0|To be honest, I probably read half of this book.  But I loved those 4 sections that I did read.  I can only imagine that Mr. Mitchell had a huge white board to map these tales woven over centuries and connected by tiny details.  Passing this book onto a friend, and hopefully she'll keep it going.
1469984202|5.0|It has been a while since I read a book while I'm was going to sleep, while on the toilet, while on my lunch break, and every other chance I had. My fiance was getting jealous because I was reading all weekend. Excited to hear that it is an ongoing series, although my one fear is that it is going to slow down like what happens in so many other series.
030758836X|4.0|With most book of this genre, I can predict the end of the story by mid-book.  This book kept me guessing, and usually wrong, until the final page.  Wonderfully written.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addicting once you start but good brain working puzzles! Good for killing time! Lots of levels don't feel I will ever have to purchase the game. You can always play under time trial and try to keep beating your personal best!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|i really like this game. i was kind of bummed to find out youhave to spend real money to progress quickly. but u can still play it w/o spending money. the only major bummer ive found after playing for several weeks is i just opened to play and found my game deleted. have to start from very beginning  dont know what happened.
0446530573|4.0|I can just smell the aromas wafting through the kitchen at my grandmother's house.  All 30 of us waiting for those Italian recipes only my aunts could make. My Dad was the baby of eight children, so there were many women that spent most of the night cooking.  Didn't have food processors back then so 6 women would chop and stuff the mushrooms. Oh, how I miss it.<br />My children always laugh when I pronounce some Italian words like beetza instead of pizza.  It was fun to read the stories as though it were a real family. Loved it!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The series has the feel of a large screen budget. The writing is excellent. The drama riveting. Not to be missed.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved it! Great character development, good story telling, well edited, and a fun read. It won't blow your mind with literary genius, but it is very entertaining in my opinion.
B005FVNIW6|4.0|Something different, kept me reading and thinking.<br /><br />I'd give it 4.5 if I could and would recommend it to anyone whom likes thinking!
B009VB97EY|2.0|quality was great. Channing Tatum and his moves, awesome. if you add all his dance scenes up you probably get around 10 min of him and his stripper moves. story line and movie plot, horrible. matthew mcconaughey was more annoying then ever. 10 minutes of Channing and his stripper moves isn't enough to watch this movie ever again. one time viewing in my opinion.
1401307450|5.0|Awesome Buy, the book came in a quicker than expected time and the price was real low, I would use this vendor again and would recommend everyone to buy this book
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love all the different reading plans and how accessible this makes reading the Bible. Excellent work! I'm getting more and more use out of it every day.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|This book, as with other books of Grisham was well written and I enjoyed it. A must read for all fans.
B006VSP906|3.0|A book with starts with promise, at times insightful and humourous, but a missed opportunity to dive deeper into the question of mortality. While Hitchens has great style, writes as he speaks, the book might leave someone strggling with the question hungry. While not agreeing with him on the God question - which he addresses with disappointing predictability although not without some humour - there was an expectation of something that had yet to be said. Fans of the author will not be dissappointed, but anyone interested in the title might.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|The movie was difficult to watch and the storyline was absurd. Abraham Lincoln who had no special powers just simply trained to develop strength to ward off and track down vampires. That was no plausible in defending against a vampire.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a great application.  Very easy to use and to navigate.  Highly recommended for people with Facebook accounts.  This is much quicker than using the web browser to enter your Facebook account.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|If you desire a skilfully plotted and believable anti hero read the you can't go wrong with Reacher. I am reading all the Reacher novels in order (for the second third or fourth time) and still can't put the damn things down once I turn the first page!
B0090YHSFC|1.0|I downloaded this from the free app of the week, but it wasnt even worth the download time. This game might entertain a 3 year old but I cant imagine anyone beyond that age range enjoying it.
B000GWE44U|5.0|this is so much better than the jack nicholson movie.  goes right along with the book  characters not big stars but they all did a very good job.  really enjoyed it.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I thought it was pretty enjoyable for the most part.  Definitely something good to watch if you want a little humor mixed with action and bits of history.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I love this game but it froze up on me.  I am at the trap door and I cant get it off the screen...
B007USWCXS|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 1.5 out of 5<br /><br /> Aki Kaurism&auml;ki is the extreme left-leaning Finnish director hell bent on satisfying every raving Francophile's dream. With 'Le Havre' he's outdone even the most radical of today's French libertarians by fashioning a tale of a never-say-die, radical liberal curmudgeon, out to save victimized third worlders from the clutches of a 'fascistic' police state (for Kaurism&auml;ki that of course includes the Catholic church).<br /><br />Our curmudgeon hero in question is Marcel, whose surname Kaurism&auml;ki unsubtly dubs 'Marx'. A self-described Bohemian, Marcel used to be a bourgeoisie writer but now shines shoes for a living, obviously sharing an affinity with his working class associates (Marcel's shoe shine partner is an undocumented alien from Vietnam who carries a fake ID). Marcel is also a free-loader, often taking food from neighborhood shopkeepers on credit, with no intention of satisfying his debts. The neighbors tolerate him as Marcel's wife, Arletty (named after the legendary French actress of 'Children of Paradise' fame), appears to be a pleasant, unassuming type and soon become much more sympathetic as she falls ill (with cancer) and has to be hospitalized.<br /><br />The inciting incident occurs when the police find a shipping container loaded with African immigrants at a dock in Le Havre. A young boy, Idrissa, runs away and a police officer is about to shoot him with an automatic weapon (only to be stopped by kindly police inspector Monet, who instructs the officer not to fire since he's only a child).<br /><br />Wouldn't you guess but Marcel and Idrissa's paths cross and soon enough, Marcel is committed to helping the boy. He travels a long way to a detention center where he finds the boy's grandfather who informs him that Idrissa's mother is now living in London (believe it or not, 'Le Havre' is billed as a comedy and Kaurism&auml;ki finds it amusing that the warden at the detention believes Marcel when he claims he's Idrissa's Albino uncle!).<br /><br />The curmudgeon, now turned unstoppable hero, must find a way to hide Idrissa since the big, bad police are after him. He asks one of the neighborhood shopkeepers, to hide the boy, and she graciously complies by safeguarding him in her apartment above her shop. Another shopkeeper, initially cross with Marcel, now gives him loads of food for the beleaguered Idrissa. In contrast to what happened in World War II, average Frenchmen here are depicted as natural humanitarians who will even break the law in the name of justice. Only government officials, backed by the aforementioned bad guy police force and a reactionary clergy, stand in the way of Idrissa's liberation.<br /><br />Marcel needs a ton of cash to have Idrissa transported by boat to his mother in London, so he dreams up the idea of a benefit rock concert. All he has to do is convince a local pop star to perform but first must bring the pop star and his wife back together after they've had a lover's spat (again, we're supposed to laugh when Marcel reconciles the two wounded lovebirds).<br /><br />After Marcel raises the cash and brings Idrissa to the boat, Inspector Monet shows up (as he's done throughout the film) and makes it clear that he's thoroughly on Marcel's side. When the police come on board, he pulls rank and pretends that Idrissa isn't below, in the hold of the boat. One is reminded of the scene in 'Casablanca', where Inspector Renault covers for Rick who has just shot Major Strasser. Just as Monet misdirects his police officers, Renault misdirects the Germans by ordering them to \\"round up the usual suspects\\".<br /><br />Earlier, we see Monet reassuring the Prefect inside the church that he's determined to catch the boy but it's obvious that he has no intention of keeping his word to the religious authorities (seen here as in league with the 'devil' police state). Funny how Monet so easily is determined to riskhis entire career for this one boy and join forces with the disgruntled Marcel. You'll also notice that Kaurism&auml;ki dare not suggest that any of the Africans that he introduces us to, are anything but upstanding, saintly citizens.<br /><br />To top it off, Kaurism&auml;ki cannot allow his audience to experience any of the hard knocks we might encounter during our travails in life. In the shockingly sentimental ending, Marcel's wife who has a terminal diagnosis, miraculously is cured and returns home with Marcel, presumably to put up with his never-ending curmudgeonly ways.<br /><br />As a registered Democrat, I am generally sympathetic to liberal causes. However, when some of my more radical left leaning brethren decide to twist reality by proffering up fairy tales of victimization and undeserved heroes sticking up for straw men victims, I can hardly remain silent. Le Havre is watchable to see just how far its misguided director will go in peddling such a self-righteous, sentimental left wing fairy tale.his entire career for this one boy and join forces with the disgruntled Marcel.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|I think this game is great. I play it over and over. The graphics and storyline are really good. I would definitely recommend it.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|its needs more time my friend said she thinks it needs more time too so you can actually enjoy it srry :( but other than that its great :D
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I own this book and have read it three times throughout the last couple of years. Definitely should be at the top of your running literature collection.

B0083IU84Y|5.0|I don't know where to begin...this album is so perfect in every way.  Jake Bugg may only be 18 years old but he has an old soul with brilliant songwriting and a fantastic voice.  The engineering on the CD is worth its weight in gold.  I'm so blown away by his talent.  Isn't it something that all the great talent comes out of the U.K.  The United States just doesn't have it.  Jake Bugg has proved he is a living legend with his debut album.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Not sure why but this one has caught me much like the Fifty series... Gideon is exciting and he keeps you wanting more.  I'll be pre-ordering the last book for next year!

B008QTVNUI|4.0|The first Season of Homeland introduces you to a very complex cast of characters. It was almost an addiction as I watched one episode after another.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game ( teachers)  can be educational in math (4&times;4)(5&times;5)(6&times;10) and so on but at the same time fun. updates will blow your mind!!!!!!
B0053JJLLC|5.0|The storyline was well conceived and the details were very compelling so that total interest was maintained throughout the reading.  A very good read.
B008XG1X18|4.0|excellent and addicting app.  works very well on my kindle fire.  does freeze up, but rarely, and can generally be fixed by restarting the app.  unfortunately does not have a mechanism for pinning webpages, can only repin what has already been pinned by others.  however these issues are minor and do not detract from what is probably my most-used app.  very well done!
B0084I9QIW|5.0|If you are a true Michael Jackson fan just buy the 25th Anniversary addition of Bad. It has great photos, small hard pics, a poster, the first Bad, another version with songs previously unreleased and a DVD of this concert. I suggest getting the Bad special edition that came out before MJ died too. It has previoulsy unrealesed songs,but not as many as the 25th edition and commentary by Quincy Jones.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Some of the levels are almost too easy to win. Other levels are nearly impossible to find the solution let alone get 3 stars. I did manage to get all the crowns but now I wonder why I bothered. Some levels have flawed physics and I hate the long delay at the start of each level.

0743201140|1.0|I was told this product was brand new and it definitely wasn't, the code the book comes with was already used so I was unable to take the Strengths Profile that is supposed to come with it. I am not happy
1936608618|5.0|I must say I was surprised on how well this book is done.  I have read a dozen or so \\"endurance\\" and \\"strength\\" books in hopes to get ideas for my clients.  As a professional strength and conditioning coach it is rare I find a book that I can actually use on a daily basis.  I have had this book for just over a week now and must say it is one I will turn to for years to come.  The running component and swimming focus on the basics, while not only telling you how but more importantly why.  What I meant by \\"surprised\\" was the fact I didn't anticipate getting a whole mobility chapter.  The mobility part alone is well worth the money, not to mention the programming.  Overall I am more then happy with this book and I will strongly recommend it to clients and others in coaching field.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Using my Kindle Fire for an alarm clock?  Who would have thought?  Simple to set up and use.  Nice to have along.  A purpose when there is no Wi-Fi available.

B00005N6KG|3.0|It feels comfortable, but it might brake any time soon, it's way too plastic and thin. In the left ear-bud I can notice distortion when I increase the volume. Other than that it works great for workouts and can rest on your neck when you are tired of it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This used to be a 5 star game, but with the latest &quot;upgrade&quot; this game has fallen in quality.  The 1st change is moving the game sections called seasons which does seem to make any rhyme or reason.  The 2nd change is you can no longer pass a level if you are stuck.  The 3rd change is they now have pay for enhancements, do you can now give them more money for a game you already own.  And lastly the game will just randomly close when try to go to a different menu.  What was a fun 5 star fun game has just become a hassle.  If you can get past all the problems, the game play is the same.
B005MJ883K|1.0|We started with perplexus original, which we absolutely loved and were addicted to.  Then we bought perplexus epic around July 2012.  After a couple of months, we discovered that a piece of the plastic had not been trimmed away when the toy was molded.  The ball can't pass through the piece of plastic, so the maze cannot be completed.  We tried to contact the company about the defect, and even sent them a picture of the defect, but after several months they haven't responded.  We're very disappointed.

B000063DI9|4.0|I'm not a major Maiden fan, but this is good stuff especially compared with all the contemporary rock out there. Maybe I'm getting to be a bit nostalgic here.
030758836X|3.0|This novel is really two books.  The reader has to plow through 200 or so pages of alternating chapters in which \\"he said/she said\\" verbiage sort of sets the stage for the second half of the novel, which is the real mystery portion, such as it is.<br /><br />The background first half introduces Nick Dunne, a magazine writer, and Amy Elliott, also a writer of advice columns.  Amy is portrayed as the subject of her parents' (also writers) series of books based on their daughter, \\"Amazing Amy,\\" and spoiled and rich (via the trust fund from the royalties of the books).  They meet at a party and then lose each other for moths, when a chance meeting reignites the spark felt at the first encounter.  They marry and lead a \\"charmed\\" life until they both lose their jobs.  In an effort to survive, Nick suggests they move back to his hometown, Carthage, MO, and then that's when it all falls apart.  On their fifth anniversary Amy disappears and Nick is suspected of murdering her.<br /><br />Like scheming Amy, the plot also is manipulative.  And the novel is very much overwritten and difficult to read.  The first couple of hundred pages probably could have been condensed to two chapters to set the stage for the real mystery [redundancy admitted], such as it is.

B009FB3WQ4|3.0|I just finished watching the DVD and was very disappointed! The show is heavily edited and only shows Barbra Streisand Performing two songs. The DVD is only approx one hour and the entire show has such a hurried pace to it showing one performer after another singing one of Barbara's songs! It would have been nice if the producer of this DVD could have featured the entire show because I know that Barbra sang more than 2 songs! For the true Barbra Fan who needs to be a completist and own everything that she comes out with, I would still buy it but be warned there isnt much of Barbra on the DVD!
B00003CWN3|5.0|This movie is truly amazing, sad, and a true tear-jerker. It was well made and even though it didn't stay true to the real Teena Brandon, Swank acting was great
B0083DJUMA|4.0|The author covers this &#34;new revolution&#34; in a very easy way to follow, showing references and examples, but sometimes he tends to turn his own experience/view as a rule for everything maker related. I´m pretty much on the same page, but I believe that someone not into already into this trend will see things so clearly.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|its a great game but could we at least have 30 min I mean it only gives you 15 min
1423140605|4.0|Rick Roirdan's The Mark of Athena takes us closer towards the end of our mythical journey in the book series: The Heroes of Olympus. Through this modern take on Greek and Roman mythology, Roirdan introduces us to the seven demi-gods who are destined by a prophecy to save the world from Gaea, the earth goddess, by closing the Doors of Death. The story focuses on Annabeth, the daughter of Athena (the goddess of war and wisdom), who is given the impossible task of finding the mark of Athena, hence the name of the book. The legend started when the Romans stole a statue from the Greek goddess, which forced her to turn into her Roman form (Minerva). After this, Athena has been persuading her demi-god children to follow the \\"mark\\" and return what rightfully belongs to her.  Along the way, readers will meet many Gods and creatures like Zeus, Dionysus, Hera, centaurs, and nymphs, and experience many epic battles between the Romans and Greeks.<br /> With its epic battles, famous Gods, and ancient mythological creatures, this novel was truly a page-turner for me and I enjoyed it very much.  The author was successful in keeping the story exciting by leaving the readers with cliffhangers by the end of every chapter. As the reader, I was able to follow the development of these characters as they faced many challenges. I recommend this book to anyone who is a teen or older and is looking for adventure.

He and his driver were killed when their jeep hit a patch of black ice that propelled them through the railing - to the tressel below.

Otherwise it works great!<br />WARNING:Don't buy this game if you don't have the time to just sit and play it. It is that addicting. ;-)
0374531943|5.0|Michael Collins, book Carrying the fire is one  the quintessential books about the space program.  It is my favorite book to go back to, for it places you right in the Aplolo program, Mike Collins takes you on a journey through his time at NASA, first going up in a Gemini than flying to the moon.  Unlike some other biographies which are works of a professional author dictated by an astronout, This book is all first person, taking the reader up from his seat and with Mike, and his humble way of talking takes you with him as if you are one of his best friends.  His simple country boy charm of &#34;Oh shucks, that was nothing&#34;, puts you in the capsule with Neil and Buzz.  He is also very funny, in a dry humor sort of way, and I don't think I can say enough about this book, other than you can't go wrong with it.  Its a first hand account about the space program and the life of one of Americas biggest unsung heros.  Michael Collins was a very special kind of man, it took a hell of a man to take one for the team and stay in the ship while your friends went down to the moon.  The book can be opened up to almost any page and you will hard to put it down, for all throughout it its filled with very cool stories. I strongly suggest it to anyone who has any interest in the space program,  even if you do not know anything about about it you would like this book just on the fact that it's an adventure.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|This book has helped me gain strength, flexibility, and a better physique. I was looking for something I could do with little or no equipment, and I haven't found anything better yet.<br /><br />Introduces you to 6 categories of calisthenics, with 10 exercises each, leading up to a final Master step for each category.<br /><br />All the master exercises are extremely difficult and require preparation. I wouldn't recommend trying them til you've worked at the first 10 exercises for quite some time.<br /><br />THEY ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, and I challenge anyone reading this to attempt to work your way up to the master steps and perform them for reps. I'm not even close to getting all 6. I can perform 4 of them but not even close to the required reps. This book gives me a lot of room for growth.<br /><br />That is the great thing about this book. It has the potential to give you years of workout material if you know how to use it.<br /><br />All the exercises do not require weights and this are very healthy for tendon, joint, and ligament health as well as muscle building and strengthening.<br /><br />Some of the story-telling is a bit hard to believe at times but the lessons and motivation are all there.<br /><br />Some day when I have kids I will use this book to help them lead healthy, athletic lives.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this book and actually follow through. This book is a much better value than P90X, Insanity, etc. It is educational and motivational.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I actually like this one better than some of the previous Mitch Rapp novels, and think that at least Flynn is writing his own books and working at it, unlike some of his competitors who have ghost writers and \\"co authors\\".  This material appears to be completely Flynn's writing and it is pretty good.<br /><br />The plot is trick and has plenty of suspense, and with Rapp involved you know there is plenty of action.  The best part, however, is the excellent job Flynn has done decribing the intricacies of the ISI, the treachorous Pakistani intelligence service.  This was really well done.<br /><br />As to complaints about high pricing, I can only point back to what I said above, and Flynn is providing more value than many authors for whom Amazon is charging very high Kindle prices.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|I rarely read a book, this was recommended by a friend and I read it in three days which i‘m amazed at.

B009AMANBA|4.0|I really enjoyed Spielberg's Lincoln, but I have to say it was not what I expected. This is probably my own fault for not reading up on it before going to see it. So just to clue anybody else in who doesn't know- this is not a biographical movie about Lincoln. This is more about Lincoln's efforts to get the 13th Amendment passed. It focuses heavily on politics, which, if you think are bad now, were just as bad, if not worse, in 1865.<br /><br />As expected, Spielberg does an exceptional job of capturing the historic details in architecture, lighting, costumes, dialogue, character, transportation, all those things. And the acting of Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, and Tommy Lee Jones is brilliant. Daniel Day is always great, but Sally Field is truly amazing as Mary Todd, and should get an Oscar for this. The make-up artists re-created the historic characters so well, I was blown away by how close they matched historic photos of Lincoln, Seward, Stanton, and Thadeus Stevens. The only character that seemed lacking in this regard was Ulysses S. Grant, played by Jared Harris. To be fair, Grant is a fairly minor character in this movie, which is a shame. Harris is a great actor, they just didn't allow him the opportunity to bring Grant to life. Which could easily have been done without it becoming a war movie.<br /><br />My main issue was- I wish this had been more about Lincoln's life, and his role in the Civil War, and less about politics. Anybody else sick of hearing about political squabbling as much as I am?<br /><br />One production issue that stuck out to me was Lincoln's steamboat, the River Queen. Civil War historians know all about this boat, and I was glad to see it included here. Unfortunately, after 3 or 4 shots of the side of the boat, you get the idea that this was as much of the set as was built. (Which I'm sure was the reality of it.) It just seems out of character with the rest of what was an exceptionally well-made movie. It would havebeen nice to see a full boat, either steaming up the Potomac, or just shown from a different vantage point. Every scene with the River Queen shows the same side view.<br /><br />One other sequence which seemed short-changed to me was the post-surrender scene at Appomattox Court House. There is no dialogue whatsoever in the scene. I guess you could argue that the silence makes it more solemn and dramatic. To me it just seemed a little flat overall. Aside from no diaogue, it just seemed cold, and lacking in emotion. This was the end of the bloodiest conflict in American history, and it gets about 2 minutes in this movie. The scene of Lincoln's son at the theater hearing that his father had been shot was gut-wrenching, but regarding the war- Spielberg just didn't make me feel the same tragic sense of loss.<br /><br />I'm sure this will win lots of awards, I just wish the scope hadn't been so narrow, and stilted on showing the war. It would have been nice if they had cut to show what was happening to the soldiers on the battlefields and in the camps more often. Yes, they show Petersburg burning (but no people in the shot). Yes, they show Lincoln riding through a battlefield (after the battle). Yes, Lincoln's son witnesses a wheelbarrow full of amputated limbs being dumped. So yes, there are a few of these kinds of scenes, but they are few and far between in proportion to what is going on in Washington, and just not developed enough to instill a sense of the misery of the men in the field and the families who suffered. When you see the trailer, you get the impression that there is as much about the war as everything else, but that's not the case. I guess if they were honest in the trailer, far fewer people would probably see it. Maybe that's because so many of us are sick of all the political games we hear about every day.
1451648537|5.0|Excellent choice for my vacations. Very interesting, just what I wished for. The cover, paper and general conditions are OK. Delivered right on time.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game! It works well.on my kindle fire and the dragons are sooooo cute! You need a lot of patience with this game for it takes some time to breed dragons, hatch eggs, and then grow them into adults. But its great fun to watch all the process of that. I would recommend it only if your not in a big hurry for results.
B008D19WBQ|3.0|Like most every other fan of this classic show I was thrilled to learn it was coming to DVD but not so thrilled to learn it would not be the extended episodes that are on the DVD's. I have been a fan of the show since day one and have all the DVD's already so I was not sure if it would be worth purchasing the Blu-ray version. In the end I did buy it. There are a lot of good things about this set. First the picture is incredible and the bonus features are great. This is a 21 disc set with each season complete on two discs and disc 21 holding additional bonus material. The box set itself is very nice and the book included is a great quick reference guide when trying to determine which season your favorite episode took place in. It lists episode titles and descriptions along with pictures from the show. However, as perviously mentioned this are not the extended episode that are on the DVD's. That was a huge disappointment. In the end I will keep both the Blu-rays and DVD's in my collection but with this had been done the right way.

0439023483|4.0|I was told I had to read these books, I didn't want to but just watching the movie wouldn't do justice. I'm glad I listened! It took me a while to get into the first book. It started slow but once it hit the middle I couldn't put it down. If you thought the movie was good, you should really read the book.

B009E3EY38|5.0|Like all other Led Zeppelin fans out there, I've been wanting a reunion of sorts for many years. While they played a few times during the 80's and then again when Robert Plant and Jimmy Page teamed up for their Page & Plant tour, nothing compares to this. The only problem is that it was a one and only show. Maybe it's better that way...we can add it to all of Zeppelin's history and look on it as one of their shining moments. I can say without a doubt that this concert is my new favorite Zeppelin show...only because it proves they can still rock it and while the songs are old, they sound fresh and new...almost adapted for their older age. This Blu-ray is in full HD widescreen and 5.1 Dolby Digital sound and it sure makes Zeppelin look and sound better than they ever have. And that's saying a lot.<br /><br />The packaging isn't that great I must say. It's built like a double-cd box set, yet they were able to squeeze 4 discs inside along with a little booklet. Given that the primary focus here is the concert, it would have been nicer to place everything into a double Blu-ray box so it would fit nicely in the video collection, but this shortcoming is not enough to remove any stars!<br /><br />Either one of the concert video or audio discs would be great buys on their own, but to have them all together in this set along with a DVD disc of the concert rehearsals is nothing short of amazing. I would highly recommend this set to any Zeppelin and/or classic rock fan!!

B008CJ0JTI|2.0|This film is a trite 90's foe-thriller that completely abandons plausibility. The script is terrible, but the acting and directing are great. It's still barely able to save this story at all. Pass if not for the Fincher completists. The writing team also penned the last two Terminator movies and Catwoman.
B008220BW0|5.0|I don't remember seeing a better surf film.  Not comparing to the documentaries, like Endless Summer, because this is also a story.  I believe this film will be considered a surf classic down the road.<br /><br />Beautiful footage of the surf, particularly, of what the surfer sees from \\"outside\\".  If you've ever surfed norcal, it will be an eerie, but very cool feeling when you recogize those cliffs with that tremendously wide blue green giant raising it's shoulders up in the foreground.  As compelling as the story is, those scenes are also very very special.<br /><br />Not like the large number of cheesy b-movie surf flicks (which I kind of enjoy); this is a well written, well filmed, well acted drama about some very interesting people's lives.  Both a true story and a true taste of surfing and the surf culture in northern california where the waves are big and the water is very cold.  With a rare glimpse into the character of a few of the exceptional individuals in that culture.  And it left me thinking.<br /><br />Loved it.<br /><br />Plan to buy a Blu-Ray for myself and a DVD for a friend of mine, as soon as they are released.  Hopefully before Christmas.  I'm not a plant.  Not a poser.  Not trying to sell this movie.  I just loved it and wanted to tell everyone.
1451695195|4.0|I believe that Dr Alexander experienced a profound and life-changing event.  Was it a near-death experience? Yes I think that it was.  It certainly shored up his faith in God and it appears to have changed his outlook on life and on love.  His experiences while in a coma that should have taken his life have apparently changed his outlook on how the soul manifests itself after leaving this earth.<br /><br />For me there was a bit too much science in this book and too much quantum physics. However, Dr. Alexander, a scientist and neurosurgeon, could not get away from that since it is the very air that he breaths and that which he has studied for most of his life.  So that is understandable. He does not tell too much about his near-death experience other than his take-away from that experience being that we are all loved and that there is much in the universe that we do not understand.<br /><br />He does explain that where he traveled was indescribably beautiful and that he was at peace.  He does describe seeing what he thinks were angels so that is comforting if as a reader you are looking for something that you can relate to in the biblical realm.  He also describes how things are communicated in the heavenly realm.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book but as I stated before some of the scientific jargon got in the way for me.  However, if you are seeking some comfort in the afterlife and some answers, then I think that Dr. Alexander's book is enlightening. This is a short book but worth reading.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|My dad took me to see this movie when I was a very little girl (when my Mom was getting close to having my baby sister). I loved it so much, I begged him to sit through TWO more showings! He must have liked it too or just wanted to give my Mom some \\"alone time,\\" because he agreed to watch it two more times.<br /><br />My own daughter loved it as much when she was a little girl so it has a special place in my heart! The high quality of clear definition to the images is fantastic (you can actually see where Dick Van Dyke's bald cap is when he's playing the old bank president, Mr. Dawes). The sound and color are so vivid - they must have really worked some Mary Poppins magic to bring such clarity and color to this 45+ year old film!<br /><br />My family loved reading all of the pop-ups that gave us little trivial insights into the actors, scenes, costumes, etc.,  This is a beautiful family musical that is just as entertaining today as it was over four decades ago. It's no wonder that it received 13 Oscar nominations and won five including Best Movie and Best leading Actress (this went to Julie Andrews and Mary Poppins was her first starring role).<br /><br />I read that the 45th anniversary edition had less on the movie and more on the recent (Broadway) stage production so I'm glad I ordered this edition. It has some amazing features on how the movie & scenes were made and commentary by Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, & others.
0783225547|5.0|This is a bit of an underrated film. It contains one of Pierce Brosnan's best performances. The acting and not the plot are what make this action film a cut above many others in the same genre. And the score and especially the main title theme are just very inspiring.

B006POGWB6|2.0|i don't understand the rave for this movie. 95% on rotten tomatoes? give me a break!<br /><br />i have seen pina bausch's productions many times - mostly in wuppertal - and loved each and every one of them! the movie, however, does not even come close.<br />i was assuming that we would be able to get an overview of her various works - instead it is limited to only very few original productions and i am left wondering why wim wenders limited himself - and her - in such a way. very sad.<br /><br />the electricity of the original work is definitely lost in wenders' translation - instead the cast is given ample room for their 'insights' into their relationships with her.<br />calling this movie \\"pina\\" is a misnomer. this is not about her; it is about her grieving cast.<br /><br />----<br /><br />\\"pina\\", take 2:<br /><br />i would like to clarify that i would have liked to have given \\"pina\\" 2.5 stars - which, of course, is not possible. many of the visuals deserve a higher rating - however, the issues i am having are with its content.<br /><br />in short: the production value of \\"pina\\" is certainly outstanding and the 3D version a feast for your eyes - but the content of the movie does not do pina bausch nor her work much justice.<br />instead, where the late choreographer was a lifelong 'miner' of truth and raw emotions, wenders remains on the surface seemingly unable to fathom the depth of \\"pina\\".<br /><br />in order to understand where the movie falls short, one has to know her work - and ideally, the performances have to be seen in their entirety. obviously, this is not possible and, out of many, wenders draws from 4 productions: le sacre du printemps (which i believe to be a less accessible piece), caf&eacute; m&uuml;ller (an early work), vollmond (a more recent production) & kontakthof (a piece which i believe is originally divided in two different and separate performances, and conceived as workshops - one inviting \\"teenagers age 14 and up\\" to participate, the other inviting \\"ladies and gentlemen age 65 and up\\").<br /><br />to someone completely unfamiliar with her work it should be said that pina bausch's oeuvre does not revolutionize dance through the inventions of moves or outstanding physical achievements but rather through the depth of feelings that she got her dancers to explore and convey. feelings of anguish, terror, love, longing, and pursuing questions of communication and personal boundaries. she would use improvisations and integrate pantomime and small gestures (even sign language) into the works, as well as dream sequences, montages, songs and speech, and much more.<br /><br />the german wikipedia mentions that she would give her dancers tasks like: \\"do something very small. interrupting something, what happens? do something very dangerous with a very cute object. [show] a gesture which has something to do with helplessness.\\" she would then note the answers & reactions without judgement or comment, thus complying a huge collection of material - of which 90% was then discarded.<br /><br />pina bausch was asking: how can i express what i am feeling? and is noted for saying: \\"i am less interested in how people move but rather what moves them.\\"<br /><br />none of these questions are explored in wenders' movie. her dancers - whom we see in individual interviews, often in a silent pose with their voices overlayed - are talking about their experiences with her, yet the insights are limited and almost platitudinal. for instance: one female dancer explains that, because she was fearful of pina out of her respect for her, she would at first hide behind the back of other dancers when pina would critique the troop. eventually pina asked her: \\"what's wrong, i am not doing anything [to you]?\\" and the dancer eventually learned to relax more in her presence.<br />another (young) dancer is heard saying that, as the child of two dancers belonging to the troop, she was the first one to be born into the tanztheater, hence growingup in it and that she does not know what life without pina will possibly look like.<br /><br />these interviews, that are cutting into the selection of the mentioned 4 works that wenders is showing, are also mingled with various sequences, some of them being rather gratuitous - for instance those in which groups of dancers are photographed with an annoying whining sound of a decaying flashbulb.<br /><br />other sequences take the dancer/s outside, placing them in the middle of the screeching wuppertal-traffic or inside a swimming pool with screaming children in the background, in which the dimly lit dancer in the foreground is moreover being out-staged by the sunlit water in the background.<br />of these outdoor performances, the first half are being filmed in rather noisy, distracting locations - and of those, especially one sticks out as a strange 'comment': it shows an upbeat performance of a male dancer whose feet are constantly being snapped at by a smallish dog while the dog's owner sits back on a park bench in the background, observing the scene.<br />later a dancer compares (the almost anorexic) pina bausch to a big, lovable hippo - a prop used in her performance \\"arien\\" - and i am left wondering if the snappy dog is meant as another `reincarnation' of the late choreographer...<br /><br />all these repeated interruptions of the 4 performances wenders selected make it difficult to understand and appreciate the works - which, after all, are mainly supposed to explore, express and convey feelings - which are in themselves a subtle language.<br />instead, her string of thought (= her dancers' performances) is constantly interrupted by an AD(H)D wenders who is imposing himself rather than giving her (dancers) and the audience the room and the opportunity to 'listen', watch and understand what is being 'said'.<br /><br />wenders decision to take the dancers out of the stage environment and into settings in and around wuppertal is another choice which i find ratheralienating - especially in the first half of the movie, where he choses locations in which the performances almost disappear within the settings.<br />her work is conceived for the stage and seeing the dancers outside in their full 'attire' (lovely flowing dresses for the women - which, on occasions are also worn by men - a 'device' pina liked to play with) makes them stand out like strange flowers in an urban landscape of noise & traffic - again distracting the audience from pina bausch's goal: the conversion of often subtle feelings. while these location choices certainly evoke emotions, they do not allow an inward listening to what is being expressed in the dance.<br /><br />for the later part, wenders choses calmer and more artistic locations which allow a 'dialog' between the performances and the environment, making these scenes a much more pleasant experience. but while these sequences are a visual feast, they all lead away from pina - and instead of exploring a person with a compelling ethos who pursued many essential questions all her life - wenders imposes his directorial mechanics instead.<br /><br />to an audience unfamiliar with her work and exhilarated by the dance scenes and the superb 3D quality, wenders movie must feel like a revelation. to people familiar with her work, it is certainly exciting to see her achieve further recognition through wenders' movie. but for those in search for depth and an exploration of her work, this movie is a disappointment..<br /><br />to an audience unfamiliar with her work and exhilarated by the dance scenes and the superb 3D quality, wenders movie must feel like a revelation. to people familiar with her work, it is certainly exciting to see her achieve further recognition through wenders' movie. but for those in search for depth and an exploration of her work, this movie is a disappointment.
030758836X|4.0|An interesting story, told from the point of view of both the husband and the wife.  You begin in one place, are given a fairly straightforward story, then the story moves into its second phase, and your ideas are shifted in fascinating ways.  The end is unsettling; maybe that was intended.  It ends with a very interesting remark:  \\"you have to wake up and be what you are,\\" which spurs thought (at least it did in me).  There are two or three plot twists that seem to have been contrived to get the story where Ms. Flynn wanted to take it, but they aren't very bad, and all in all, it's a satisfying read and a considerable cut above the usual thriller.  On the other hand it's not a lot more than a thriller, although it WILL make you think about the compromises of marriage and a life lived as a kind of wunderkind/golden boy.<br /><br />I liked the woman cop.  You didn't know exactly where she was going, but she was pretty well-filled-out as a secondary character.<br /><br />I didn't like the end; I like my thrillers a little more along the lines of the hero is vindicated and the bad guy gets what he deserves.  This one doesn't exactly go there.  Also, I don't know how the \\"innocent\\" party could continue on in their chosen life.  I would find it impossible, that's why I thought the end of the story was unsettling.<br /><br />Good story, though, well worth your time.
0374530718|5.0|why we experience anything at all, this book is for you. If you ever watched the movie \\"Matrix\\" and feel that you \\"get it\\", this book is for you. Jostien goes many layers deeper into the very nature of reality itself rather than mindlessly writing about every philosophical movement since Socrates.<br /><br />This is the first book on philosophy, I read, that gently blends western history into philosophy and further blending the streams of Eastern and western philosophies. It gives you a perspective on the why different movements arose and the accompanying religious, political and economic conditions during those time periods. I have read different books on philosophy and I find most books dry and devoid of the soulfulness that should accompany this subject. A lot of books are overly rational and objective in their content and is restricted by the limited understanding of the authors writing the books.<br /><br />Sophies world in comparison examines both the objective and the subjective and while it doesn't lay out a straight path to follow or cover every philosopher in history, Jostien is bold yet diplomatic in making clear where he stands. Not all books are for everyone but this book is definitely for me.

B002GHIPYI|2.0|What's the point of a flat frequency response headphone? Harsh highs and weak bass is all that gives you. There's no point in using it as a studio monitor because it's not how any consumer will ever hear your music. Also, stop calling your products \\"HD,\\" \\"Superlux.\\"

B002RI9HUM|4.0|When I first started reading this book, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, but by the end of it, I had really enjoyed it.  It is about a girl who was quite a partier but didn't consider it a problem, until she ended up in a rehab centre called the Cloisters.  It takes place in New York and Ireland in the 1990's.  By the end of it, I felt like we all could probably benefit from a little psychoanalysis.  I would recommend this as a good read.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|huge fan of the show, couldnt wait to get on with the story. Starts a little slow but picks up
1419705849|5.0|My Grandson had told me about this series and how he wanted to read it.  So far we have every one of the books and he is ready for more!  I got him this latest book for his birthday and he actually went off to a corner during his birthday party and began reading!  It is great to see a child so excited about books!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I can say with clear conscience that this is definitely the best book I've read this year.<br /><br />The characters' development is done amazingly well - in fact so well, that you grow to like and feel with not only the main character, but all the secondary ones too. Vaelin in particular was so much like a real person that I certainly felt like reading the story of someone of flesh and blood. Even the animals were unique and memorable characters on their own accord.<br /><br />The story is captivating, greatly planned in all small details, and with many subtle twists and turns. There were at least five-six places where I thought 'Yea, ok, so far so good, now we'll have 30 pages fill-in...' only to be surprised half a page later with an unexpected turn of the events that pulled my attention right back in. The book is long, longer than most books I've read in the last months, yet I never felt the volume. The story was flowing like a fast river, taking me with it and not allowing me to stray away.<br /><br />The Blood Song is pure pleasure for the mind. If you love classic fantasy, you definitely have to read it.

B008MEM24S|2.0|I really liked the game but unfortunately I can't let my small children play or they will keep buying the upgrades and extras. Sad... wish they would have left it the regular way. I paid for the game and now they want to get the kids to click on more stuff for more money. Disappointed. :(

031250926X|5.0|This is our one year old's son favorite book!  It is very sturdy and brilliantly colorful!  Our little guy can be a little rough on books and has ripped off pieces of some other interactive books that have hidden images.  However, with this one, while he loves to slide open the picture window over and over again and view the hidden images, he has yet to cause any damage to the book!

B007QUUIEA|5.0|A fabulous novel that was very enjoyable to read. I would always look forward to reading each chapter of the book, leaving you questions and feelings as to what would happen to Charlie. Chbosky is an excellent author and I am looking forward to reading his next book/novel.
B0000AUHQF|5.0|The story that all is possible if you believe in yourself and the power of your dreams. I love this movie not only because I was AT this game but because it shows how much you can overcome including the names and ideas put on you by family....It shows that with persistence and determination you can achieve whatever you want. It is also entertaining and fun to watch!
0525958002|5.0|I was thrilled to find out that my favorite Duran wrote his story!  Sometimes when you read autobiographies you are afraid to find out who the person really is....  John tells his story as if it is a conversation.  The back story of Duran Duran is fascinating.  I had no idea that Nick and John were so ambitious and tenacious.  Having that kind of drive is even more admirable to me than someone that possesses natural talents. John knew what he wanted and he made it happen.  I was especially moved by his story of recovery.  I can't imagine how difficult that must be in his line of work.  It is hard enough just being a regular ol' American staying clean and sober one day at a time.  Truly an inspirational person!

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought I was finally old enough that I would no longer really really like any &#34;young adult&#34; novel, but this entire series proved me wrong. Suzanne Collins hooked me with The Hunger Games and I stayed hooked all the way to the very end of Mockingjay.<br /><br />I would first like to re-iterate my final thoughts on the series as a whole before I get into anything more specific: this series has relationships in it but it is far from some teen love story where everyone lives happily ever after with their soul mate and the world is a perfectly perfect happy place. People die, often in bloody and terrible ways which not even the children are exempt from. So reader you have been warned - don't read this series if you can't stand violence, murder, blood and general mayhem.<br /><br />This book has a different feel to it and new unique situations that set it apart from the others. Katniss is still our main character but circumstances have changed and she is no longer that lone warrior we met in book 1. We always got to see exactly what was going on in her head but in this book all that has happened weighs on her more than ever. I'd imagine that to some people the way Katniss behaves at times in this book would make them like her less, but personally it made me like her more. Book 2 had more main and secondary characters than book 1 and book 3 really brings them forward while adding even more. Katniss's character grows with the influence of these additions.<br /><br />Some fans are probably going to be very pleased with the way Collins completed this series, others are probably going to upset, but at least part of the ending explains itself. Some of what happens is kind of predictable but Collins does hide some surprises up her sleeves. Readers should keep in mind that if every book ended just the way we thought it should then things would be very boring indeed. I enjoyed this series a lot.<br /><br />*Review re-posted from goodreads.com
B009AMANBA|5.0|Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner adapt a snippet from Doris Kearns Goodwin's award winning book and rewards movie goers with one of the best movies of the year.  Spanning less than 4 months beginning in January of 1865, the film and Lincoln's (remarkable Daniel Day-Lewis) focus is on the passing and ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution which abolishes slavery.<br /><br />The nation was begging for an end to the Civil War which had killed over 600 thousand Americans and nearly destroyed the economy.  Although Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation theoretically freed the slaves, Lincoln knew it was a wartime fiat that he feared would not pass muster in peacetime.  He was reluctant to end the war until the Amendment solidified his position.  This was not an easy task.<br /><br />Although his conservative Republicans were against slavery some were concerned this might lead to further rights such as voting.  If trying to hold his own majority party in line wasn't difficult enough he had to convince 20 Democrats to also vote his way.  As a result he was forced to strike a deal with Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), a Democratic abolitionist to wrangle a few votes.<br /><br />All the while Lincoln was dealing with his wife Mary (wonderful Sally Field) who was still trying to manage her grief after losing her son two year earlier.  Spielberg for the most part, spares the audience the theatrics and focuses on the character of the president and his folksy way of garnering support.  Adept at story telling Lincoln manages to conjure up just the right yarn to make his point.<br /><br />In one scene Lincoln is about to send a telegram to Gen. Grant to bring the Southern peace delegation to Washington, something he does not want to do until the amendment passes.  With only the telegraph operator and an engineer present he asks them if they are familiar with Euclid's common notion.  He then quotes the theory of how if things are equal to the same things they are also equal to each other.  This is a self-evident truth of mathematics.  He decides not to have the delegation come to Washington.<br /><br />The great enjoyment of this educational and entertaining film is the great words, the great acting and the great moviemaking.  Oscar will be kind.same things they are also equal to each other.  This is a self-evident truth of mathematics.

B005RUUUAI|4.0|I love this show but Season 2 dragged a little bit. The new characters are interesting in their own way but with the whole group staying in one place for so long it really needed some more action.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Matthew McConaughey was better than I expected.  He's not usually one of my favorites, but the thing that really sold me on this movie was the cinematography...Lukas Ettlin - that's a name I will look for in the future.  Loved the camera angles, the color, the kind of gritty look.<br />The story line in this film kept my interest to the end.  Another reviewer said the author has written similar novels, so I'll look for books by Michael Connelly.
B003O86FMW|4.0|After finishing The Hunger Games I went online right away to download Catching Fire because I couldn't wait to find out what would happen. When I finished Catching Fire I did the same thing; I went online right away (maybe faster even than the first time!) and downloaded Mockingjay (The Hunger Games series #3). I'm not going to say I liked Catching Fire better than the first book, but by the end of this one I felt even more invested with the characters and I was like a little kid who just couldn't possibly ever wait to find out what was next.<br /><br />I won't spoil anyone's fun by giving too much away, but Katniss Everdeen is still the main character and, Katniss being who she is, her bad luck won't let her stay out of trouble yet again. Some reviewers have said that book #2 is just more of the same but I personally never got bored with the story line. There are new characters thrown into the story, including some who are well enough developed that they essentially join the group of characters you'll actually care about. These new characters really help keep things interesting.<br /><br />This was again, a quick read but highly enjoyable. The end was excellently written by Collins; it is the type of cliff hanger that is almost painful because you just can't wait to see what happens.<br /><br />*Review re-posted from goodreads.com
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I like the functionality of this app, it's a decent substitute for MS Office in a pinch, but it's limited in advanced features and sometimes laggy on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\", particularly with my bluetooth keyboard input.<br /><br />Advanced features you'll find in MS Office are not included here, such as drag-and-drop margins, image editing, as-you-type spellcheck, and complex formatting. That's pretty much expected for a free app.<br /><br />The good: It's a pretty decent office app you can put on your tablet. Compatible with peripheries like bluetooth keyboards and has good Cloud integration through the service of your choice. Reads and edits docs and spreadsheets with advanced formulas. Also reads and lets you bookmark locations in PDFs.<br /><br />The bad: One of the minor nitpicks I have is the font, which is Arial or some other sans serif font (I like serifs) which cannot be changed. The program also doesn't read data on automatic space added between paragraphs, which can be a problem if your required format does not include tabbed indentations on the first line, or a full line between bodies of text. It also only has metric units. The word count feature also seems to be wildly inaccurate, adding an extra 2% or so when compared to other word counting programs. The spreadsheet editor is pretty reliable for the most part with anything short of macros, though the editing process is a little cumbersome and some expected features like adaptive cut-and-paste are not present.<br /><br />Various bugs have popped up on occasion, like not correctly reading special Word \\"curly\\" quotes and other symbols, but the company seems very determined to fix these bugs... eventually. Overall they are responsive to user emails, which I have been grateful for. All in all, they get kudos for a very solid free app.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had wanted to read this book for a long time and was not disappointed. I knew this book is considered young adult fiction so I expected that I would be annoyed by under-developed (or completely undeveloped) characters and a cheesy plot line, but that's not how I felt when I read it. Because the main character is a likable and talented teenage girl I can imagine some potential readers saying &#34;Oh no, not again!&#34;, but this isn't just another one of &#34;those&#34; books where the pretty teenager gets everything she ever dreamed of and rides off into the sunset etc etc.<br /><br />This is a post-apocalyptic type book where once a year &#34;the Capital&#34; forces two children/teenagers from each of twelve districts to fight to the death on live (mandatory to watch) television. This is to remind the citizens that the Capital is powerful and that the districts should not revolt against them like they had decades ago.<br /><br />I got hooked fairly early on and by the time I reached the end of the book (on my Kindle) I had to immediately buy and download the next one so I could keep reading. I would say that partway through the book I might have been able to predict what was going to happen in the end, but then again I could say the same thing about a number of different possible endings Collins could have written. So that leaves me only the ability to say that while the end was not surprising it was still well written and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />This book will probably be a relatively quick read for most adults but I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />After reading the entire series I feel like potential readers should know: This series has relationships in it but it is far from some teen love story where everyone lives happily ever after with their soul mate and the world is a perfectly perfect happy place. People die, often in bloody and terrible ways which not even the children are exempt from. So reader you have been warned - don't read this series if you can't stand violence, murder, blood and general mayhem.<br /><br />*Review re-posted from goodreads.com
B003QTUQGU|5.0|First off, I love Johnny Depp, so he completely made the movie! Secondly, I love Tim Burton and this is totally a Tim Burton movie. The colors are amazing, the acting is great, and the costumes are perfect!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is a story everyone should read. Nothing has changed in our world since this book was written. The acting Mr. Scrooge of today are our bankers, politicians and sports stars who have care for no one but themselves.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book is an interesting take on the old question: \\"What is reality?\\" but also makes you think about people and power.  It is a study on human nature and the idea of reality; it makes you think on many levels.  I could not put it down.  It starts slow, so stick with it. NOT a light read.
B001AQO3QA|1.0|Just received.  Could not play.  Demands update, including a *membership*, to Corel who makes the DVD player for my VAIO PC.

My player plays other Blu-ray disks, just not this one.
B008P1EWIM|1.0|Another wasted dollar on an app that doesn't live up to its hype.  I've been looking for a decent weather widget, and didn't realize that this was not even a widget; but that wouldn't be so bad if it were a really good app, but it's not.<br /><br />I have a 7\\" pad, which I can prop up in landscape mode with its case.  I run most things in landscape mode now, but this app insists on only running in portrait mode.  So, if I want to run it, I need to flip my device sideways to read it.  If I wanted to leave it running, I can't, because my case only supports the device in landscape mode.<br /><br />Fortunately, it's only a dollar I wasted, which is probably what the author is counting on.

B007REV4T8|5.0|This film is not just the best film of the year.  It is not just the best James Bond yet.  It is the best movie that I have ever seen!  Beautifully directed by Sam Mendes, Skyfall brings you everything you want in a film.  Romance, action, drama, comedy, adventure you name it!  Skyfall has it all.  Some people may argue that Daniel Craig is not good enough as Connery, Moore or Brosnan.  I think that Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever!  It is hard to explain, but he just looks like the Bond meant to be.  This movie will one day be a classic like The Wizard of Oz, Titanic, Hairspray, etc.  Skyfall should be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.<br /><br />Please go and see this movie, you will not regret it by any means.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I am a huge Phillip Phillips fan!  I feel in musical love when I spotted him on the audition show of AI.  I was captured completely when I searched him out on youtube and saw some of the performances there.  ( I am still waiting for him to do some of those songs live! Go search G&S Experience on youtube!) Anyway, with the exception of a few, and I mean a very few, Phillip is and will always be a musician thrown amongst the glitter that is AI.  This new album which I have now listened to 3 times since 530 am EST is incredible.  I already have some favorites-Man on the Moon, Get Up Get Down, and A Fool's Dance.  The whole album is something that not even Kelly Clarkson (also one of my favs of AI) can claim to have the first time out the door, that is- an album that is what the artist \\"IS\\" actually as an musician.  All of these songs I can see Phillip with his band behind him singing and jamming out.  I hate the comparison, but if you like/love Dave Matthews Band, Mumford & Sons, or any of that genre then you will not be disappointed.  I can't wait for a live show! Please listen I don't think you'll be disappointed! Cheers!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Watch out!  This game is very addictive. I have spent hours and hours just cooking and cooking! Although it is a very good app, I love it.
1594744769|4.0|I've always loved sci-fi, horror and adventure stories, since I was a kid. Therefore, all the main elements of this book weren't new at all to me. Anyone fond of Fantasy and Sci-Fi has read tons of stories about time travel, or people with super powers fighting secret wars. But Ransom Riggs managed to use classic fantasy features to build up a modern story that felt very fresh to me, and always quite unpredictable.<br /><br />Amazing.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie was excellent!I was very moved by the actors portrayed in this movie.I would like tosee more movies like this one.

B009LDXQGC|5.0|As with millions of other people, \\"Kryptonite\\" was one of the first songs that introduced me to 3 Doors Down. I use to live in both Japan and California (via the military) and the music of 3 Doors Down was played alot by many others that I worked around.  I am already conscious of the fact that other music listeners are going to have their own personal preferences on personal favorites from 3 Doors Down. As for me, my personal favorites from this group are \\"Kryptonite\\", \\"When I'm Gone\\", \\"Here Without You\\",  and \\"Be Like That\\".  \\"Greatest Hits\\" by 3 Doors Down is best for those who enjoy alternative rock collections.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|You never know what to expect or what will happen next. We Love it. We even have neighbors we watch each show with and have a great time.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I enjoyed \\"Talk That Talk\\" by Rihanna, but I unexpectedly like \\"Unapologetic\\" even more. She really made a creative effort in creating songs that convey a kaleidoscope of emotions while still preserving valiant musical undertones.  Obviously, millions of Rihanna listeners already have the songs in mind that resonate with them the most.  I would have to humbly list the following songs as the ones that gave me a feeling of a party for the mind:<br />\\"Phresh Out The Runway\\", \\"Numb\\" (featuring Eminem), \\"Pour It Up\\", \\"What Now\\", \\"Loveeeeeee Song\\" (featuring Future), \\"Jump\\", \\"Right Now\\" (featuring David Guetta),  and \\"Nobody's Business\\" (featuring Chris Brown).  I also decided to download a couple of tracks from her deluxe edition and really enjoyed  \\"Half Of Me\\" and the remix of \\"Diamonds\\" (Dave Aude 100 Extended version). \\"Unapologetic\\" by Rihanna is best if you enjoy any of Rihanna's previous music and/or music genres that mix R&B with both electronica and dance elements.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Got this as a Christmas gift for my great nephew.  He saw it at the movies and wanted<br />to have his own copy  Really enjoys this movie.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|\\"Best Of James Bond: 50th Anniversary\\" contains a wonderful selection of songs to go with the adventure and action theme in James Bond.  I really enjoyed so many of the songs in this soundtrack that it is hard for me to pinpoint the favorites on this one.  Plus, there is a song for everyone on this soundtrack.  The following artists are among some of the many featured in this soundtrack: Tom Jones, Nancy Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, Paul McCartney, Carly Simon, Sheena Easton, Duran Duran, A-Ha, Tina Turner, Sheryl Crow, Garbage, Madonna, Chris Cornell, and Jack White. There are also multiple artists on the second cd that are very well known.  However, I am surprised that \\"Skyfall\\" by Adele was not included on this soundtrack.  I recently saw and enjoyed the \\"Skyfall\\" film (starring Daniel Craig) and felt that Adele's version of \\"Skyfall\\" was a perfect fit to the movie.  \\"Best Of James Bond: 50th Anniversary\\" (2 cd set) is best for those who like at least any one of the James Bonds films and/or at least five of the theme songs.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|This is the best murder mystery I've seen since the original Silence of The Lambs. When watching most movies of this type I can usually figure out or predict most of the plot turns before they happen. That was not the case with this movie. However, the best part of the movie was a little more personal for me. See, I was told by some one who read the novels that the girl with the dragon tattoo was an \\"aspberger.\\" It's a syndrome that effects people cognitive abilities in a variety of ways some times even giving them something of an added intelligence. This was an aspect of the movie I quite enjoyed since I once knew a girl who had aspbergre's and that she too resembled the star of the movie in that she was diminutive in stature. I enjoyed how aspberge'rs were portrayed as intelligent and how a girl who was diminutive could more than defend and take care of herself.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|There is probably a decent plot hiding in all of this, what with an ex-sub stalking Christian and Ana.  But I just can't get past a couple of things.  One is details that the writer gets wrong.  I grew up in Seattle, and things like a character talking about \\"The Pike Market district\\", or the \\"coast road\\" in Seattle drives me nuts.  Maybe some people use those phrases, but it's Pike's Place(the market is optional) and there is no coast road in Seattle, to those I know at least.  There also isn't a \\"sea\\" anywhere close by, there is an ocean about a 2.5 hour drive west.<br /><br />But even beyond my personal pet peeves, there is WAY too much smirking, frowning, pouting, lip-biting and eye-rolling.  And I'm really over Ana's \\"Inner Goddess\\" and her subconscious.  One line in the book has Ana mentally glaring at her subconscious's face.  Really?  And her inner goddess has to stop all the Pirouetting, before Ana gets a concussion.  Then there's the scene where a college educated, supposedly smart young woman is completely shocked to learn that sex without good birth control might lead to pregnancy?!  It's jarring and takes me out of the story, such as it is.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie is excellent, action, comedy, and humility.  One of the best that I have seen, glad to have the digital copy so i can watch on my devices.  The only down fall is the music download, its the voiced music from the movie and not the composed movie during the fight sequences.  The music download was the main reason i picked this version and was very much disapointed with the outcome.  It doesn't take away from the movie at all but to me the music makes a movie.

0307730697|5.0|It is a difficult book to review. My feelings about Adam Brown and the book varied as I read it over a couple of days. Adam Brown's life story has both the best and the worst of American life.<br /><br />I was fine with the story of his putting his life together after months of being a crackhead, living with his girlfriend the one of the houses found in most every American city today. The pain he brought to his friends, family and future wife were incredible.<br /><br />His luck in having someone who backed his entry into the Navy and then into the Seals was one of extraordinary luck. His early successes in  the Seal program were a great achievement and testimony to his strengths both physical and mental.<br /><br />I really had trouble with his betrayal of his wife, family, child and fellow Seals when he went back into the drug life and reading the book I wondered if the Seals did the right thing keeping him on the team. Blehm also brings to life the role religion paid in pulling Adam back from the black hole of crack addition and helping him to realize his goals as a father, husband, son and warrior.<br /><br />The great part of the story include Brown's achievements as a Seal and as a father and husband ln the later years of his all to short life. Blehm did a fantastic job of capturing the brotherhood of warriors both on the battlefield and as they struggled with Adam's death.<br /><br />The author brings to life the terrible changes that are thrust upon too many young families of our warriors who fall in combat. From the late night arrival of notification team and the struggle to believe the message is an error to the enduring aftereffects it's all there.<br /><br />The senior officer who paved the way for Adan to be accepted by the Navy is quoted as questioning whether he did the right thing. The answer is clear, Adam could have continued to lead the life of a dirtbag crack user, destined to die a meaningless early death after inflicting harm and heartache on many or followed the path of of the warrior, living a life of honor, dedication and sacrifice.<br /><br />From the book and reviews from fellow Seals Blehm did an outstanding job of capturing not only the facts but the emotions, dramatizing or offering moral judgements.<br /><br />Highly recommended
B005ZHB84U|4.0|I actually bought this by mistake; I was trying to purchase the DVD, which is better. However, the music is interesting.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Excellent movie!  Funny and lots of action.  Great cast of characters and the 70s soundtrack tops it off!  Fans of the original series will find it a little different but interesting plot just the same.  Highly recommend.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This was even better than the first one! I could not believe it but this movie was funny, great with action and suspense. Loved it and so glad that Robert Downey Jr. is back and better than ever!
B004LM72ZY|5.0|I purchased 2 for my grandsons 3 and 16 months. They are thrilled. Well made and will last forever. Shipped on time and can't be happier.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Great cd and my intro to Muse after seeing them live with U2 in 2009. The music still sounds new!
1471101223|4.0|If you are in any way a fan of Ian Thorpe or swimming I would recommend this book.  If you are looking for a juicy salacious tell-all, this is not it. Also, you cannot really read this without knowing anything about swimming or his career, but then I doubt you would be interested. However, if you are, just read his wiki page and that should be sufficient.<br /><br />The book is organized in a diary format in the year leading up to the Olympics.  Each entry starts in the present-day struggle to earn a spot on the Aussie Olympic team, and then it reverts back to past memories or his personal ideas or beliefs on issues. The flashbacks are not in chronological order which I suppose is true to how a person looks back on past events, but it can be a little confusing at times. It's easier to read if you take each chapter at a time and don't try to organize it in your head like I did.  The transitions from the present day to past events made me keenly aware that this was written by two writers.  I imagine Ian kept a diary, and then very separately wrote about past events and the professional writer put it all together and published it in three months. So, like so many books now, it was rushed, and while clearly very edited, there are some grammatical errors and a lack of fluidity. This is why it lost a star for me. Either keep it real and rough, the way a diary is written, or make it perfectly professional.  This was very much in between the two.<br /><br />I will say the honesty throughout is really refreshing. You get a very good sense of what it must have been like to be a a champion at such a young age and the pressures he has lived with all these years and again with his comeback. He clearly is a very sensitive and private person and, as a long-time fan, this is his most revealing project.  This might be the first time we get a real sense of who he his.  The problem, of course, is he still is that private person. Unlike many other athletes's memoirs, some private issues are addressed but still glazed over or kept vague. I am not really holding the book against it, but it's important to know if you read a lot of autobiographies. I would not call it a tell-all. The exception I would say is the now famous excerpt on depression.  This was very raw and honest and deserves the attention it is receiving.<br /><br />~The following is truly personal opinion that did not factor into my review.<br /><br />He's gets annoyed but not angry, happy but not overjoyed.  The anxiety seems to be the strongest emotion he feels in his comeback, and overall I was left with a feeling of sadness, which I can't completely explain. It is extremely rare that a very shy, sensitive person would become a famous athlete. This I think it what made him and continues to make him so interesting.  However, those personality traits are disastrous combined with massive media attention and scrutiny. You receive a huge sense of this in the  book.  We are told he found the joy in swimming again, but there is not a lot of joy in this book. There is clearly still a Part II to his life which he hasn't even begun, and I hope he finds more happiness there.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|I love Muse since I saw them live in Charlottesville with U2 in 2009. Very good Cd. They also rock out!~
B005MMJ84K|5.0|It was a very good book. I Could not put it down. It was hard for me to find a good book after &#34;the hunger games&#34; but i like this one.

B00526ZKYS|5.0|I loved this book. i couldn't wait to buy the second book to start reading it. Two thumbs up for me.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|This cd is their best. I love it. It has helped me survive the worst semester of grad school, while trying to raise 3 kids and go to grad school. I love the uplifting nature of their music!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a fantastic app i just really want the update. I would love if there was redstone with every thing that goes along with that plus if it was easier to find iron or diamond. I would also add a food bar and armor because it makes it more fun and it is incredibly hard to survive with monsters.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|One of their best although I think Mylo Xyloto is even better! This is a great cd. Love Coldplay! They are very uplifting.
B005LAIISU|5.0|The 411 by Maria and Goddess:<br /><br />We don't care what they say, we thoroughly enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />This being the 4th installment of Ice Age, we thought it was as funny and it kept us watching and my 7 year old laughing which is no better advertisement for me.<br /><br />The movie as much as it is fun, witty, violent at times (cruelty to animals among the other animals) is about family, friends, working together and supporting each other.<br /><br />When Manny, the character voiced by Ray Romano, Diego (Denis Leary), Sid (John Leguizamo) and Granny (by far my favorite character) voiced by Wanda Sykes suddenly find themselves on a drifting iceberg they do whatever they can to take care of each other and get back to their family and friends.<br /><br />Their journey is dangerous and made even more complicated by Captain Gutt an ape voiced by Peter Dinklage (I was wondering who was voicing that ape!).<br /><br />All in all, we found it entertaining and loved to see Scrat trying to get that darn acorn!<br /><br />Today when Goddess finishes her homework, I am going to set her up with some online Ice Age games. She is going to love them.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I love this film. Woody Allen is either hit or miss with me and this was definitely hit! I love Owen Wilson, though it was hard to see Rachel McAdams act so bitchy.  I love the nostalgia and the shots of the city I love most in the world!
B008ZD4WN0|5.0|ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SCORPIONS ALBUMS. THIS PARTICULAR REMASTER IS REALLY GOOD, SPECIALLY COMPARED TO PREVIOUS ONES. THE SOUND IS VERY CLEAN, NOT TOO MUCH BASS. IT SOUNDS VERY ANALOGUE (WITH GOOD EQUIPMENT)NO HARSHNESS AT ALL. AN ABSOLUTE BUY NOT ONLY FOR THE ALBUM ITSELF, ONE OF THE VERY BEST HARD ROCK ALBUMS, BUT ALSO FOR THIS EXCELLENT TRANSFER.
072325804X|5.0|Very beautiful book. Great organized. Beautiful pictures. Definitely one of the best books in my daughter's home library. Although, you might want to read it together with kid if he or she is not old enough
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Best book yet! I liked how there was only one plot. The other books have varying plots and gets too off topic. Very Funny.
B007YZNRV8|1.0|Book was to replace one I lost that was loaned to me by a friend. Had it sent to them. What was sent was a \\"Readers Digest\\" type version. Very embarrassing and not what I thought I had ordered. If it wasn't a gift, it would be returned.
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|The diary of a wimpy kid books are a great book for kids that have to read in school for a grade. I have to read 800 pages per quarter and these 217 page books help a lot. I recommend this book to kiss of all ages.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|It's about time Kristen Stewart learned how to act...I mean she's no Charlize Tharon but she did pretty good. This movie was great, it had just enough action, drama, and romance..It gave me a Lord of the rings vibe which is probably the reason I liked it so much. all around good movie I definitely recommend it.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|IT WAS LIGHT, FUNNY, EXCITING.  A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE.  NICE TO WATCH WITH A BOWL OF POPCORN.  I ENJOYED IT.
B008WCP2KG|1.0|this movie was the biggest waste of an hour. Don't get me wrong I looove me some sexy channing tatum but this movie was bad. it had a terrible plot, the girl in it had no personality what so ever, and the stripper scenes were like 2 minutes and then flipped to the next scene..waste of time seriously don't bother.
B004Q3QRWC|4.0|I enjoyed this novel for its stylishness and for it's array of damaged but likeable characters. The time and scene shifts were disruptive at first but once you got used to them it settled into an interesting read.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|what is this its just a v for the pic this is stuipd I'm not buying this DONT BUY IT
B004EBT5CU|1.0|The CD is great--the cracked jewel case thanks to bad packaging is awful.<br /><br />I mailed this to my mom for a treat as she'd wanted it for quite some time. She was so excited to get it, but didn't tell me about the broken case since she didn't want to sound ungrateful. I noticed the damage for myself when I visited her yesterday.<br /><br />Very disappointing order experience due to careless shipping.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|The concept of a televised arena games where kids killing kids in gladiator fashion certainly piques interest - the power of the concept to which the fanbase to the trilogy of novels the first book the film is based on can attest to - for an audience wanting something more visceral to sink their teeth in, unlike the otherwise bland offerings of another, popular book series with vampires for the young adult demographic.  With this regard, it comes across as a bit of a shame when The Hunger Games takes what could easily have been a more intentionally controversial premise and takes a more tame and conservative execution of these themes.<br /><br />And perhaps having this film's teeth dulled could have been more forgiven had those not familiar with the events of the book be given enough of a reason to care about combatants in this 'battle royal'. Often, the film is eagerly trying to get us to feel for our reluctant little gladiators forced into combat in an authoritative society that greets their eventual demise like the punchline of a long and sick joke. Yet, there's only so much gravitas to be had about any of these fighter's death when we are only treated to several seconds of screen time among each, outside the characters the film wants us to root for. It doesn't help much when the rules surrounding the contest are constantly in flux, and thus the tensions and stakes for our heroes is dulled and no doubt thrown in to insure those with shorter attention spans are kept at the edge of their seats.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:<br />Fans of the books will no doubt find this film to appeal to the elements that drew them to the franchise in the first place. Otherwise, this film leaves much desired, even if it still manages to provide the moderate enjoyment one can appreciate from a rental.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My 9 year old really liked playing this game on his sister's phone. I decided to put it on my Kindle. We have liked this game a lot! Plus he needs to use his brainpower!

1609611543|4.0|In full disclosure, I haven't finished the book. In fact, I've only read the intro and chapter 1! Hence the reason for the 4 stars.<br /><br />I would normally consider it premature (or at worst, just unhelpful) to write a review before I had actually finished a book, but I've already seen such changes that I'm excited to share them and encourage others to buy this book, too.<br /><br />Both my mom and sister are very gluten-sensitive, so I already had an idea of how to eat gluten-free before I even started reading, so after I read the first bit and was sold on the idea, I immediately tried cutting out wheat. The results were immediate and fairly dramatic. I have a lot more energy, my thinking isn't cloudy, I'm far less irritable, am sleeping better and waking up feeling ready to go (even when I don't get much sleep), but the thing that really excites me is the loss of the cellulite in my thighs and the fat layer around my midsection.<br /><br />I'm a 5'4\\" 23 year old and have always been considered \\"skinny,\\" but in the last two years I gained this strange fat layer all over my body. I call it \\"cellulite,\\" but I don't know if it was ever cellulite. I eat well, I'm a fairly frequent exerciser, I barely ever drink soft drinks or sugary fruit juice, and yet my midsection looked like a tree trunk and my thighs were suddenly pockmarked with fatty dimples.<br /><br />I haven't even been on this diet a full week yet, and I kid you not; the dimples are disappearing, and I'm beginning to see my old, narrow waistline coming back. Also, some blue-ish purple veins that were scattered all over my thighs are beginning to go away. I'm so relieved and can hardly believe it. I think I've even lost 2-3 pounds!<br /><br />After two days of being on the diet, I \\"cheated\\" and ate a chicken fried steak at a restaurant, and it was crazy to see how quickly my thoughts clouded up and my energy dropped just a few minutes after eating that first bite of wheat. I just felt bad, and I realized that I have BEEN walking around feeling bad for a number of years now, and I just didn't even realize it.<br /><br />I'm extremely excited to see what happens as I continue to follow this no-wheat diet, and with results like these, I have no intention to stop.<br /><br />Cut the wheat to cut the weight! Buy this book!that I have BEEN walking around feeling bad for a number of years now, and I just didn't even realize it.<br /><br />I'm extremely excited to see what happens as I continue to follow this no-wheat diet, and with results like these, I have no intention to stop.<br /><br />Cut the wheat to cut the weight!

B007V2UGPE|4.0|very fun defense game.  smooth graphics and easy simply game play.  haven't tried the zombie variation but am looking forward to it.
B00540G3G6|5.0|This movie is so much fun for adults and kids alike.  My children have been begging me to buy this movie for years, and with this value, I could justify it.  It allows so much flexibility in viewing options you just can't go wrong.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|The game was fun and had various puzzles. The story was a little hard to follow, but that's not why I buy a game.
B00338QENI|5.0|I was not sure what to expect when I decided to read this book. The way Rebecca Skloot tells this story is exactly as it should be told. I find this story fascinating and am so glad that the author persisted and got this story out there. I had heard of HeLa cells but now I know exactly what they are and the story behind them . I would definitely recommend this book.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|It is what it is, and it is done right.  I picked this up just to relive my old Breakout! glory days, and this fits the bill.<br /><br />Good touch response, interesting levels.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|A great twist on some classic songs. If you're a fan of 80s rock and you've seen the musical, you will appreciate this album.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I received this cord as a replacement from Amazon because my original power cord/USB microport completely disintegrated!  The white plastic cover crumbled off leaving exposed bare wires.  The replacement seems OK for now.  I will have to wait and see if this will have the same problem over time!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I absolutley loved this book.  I read it because it was on the reading list of one of my book clubs.  We discussed this book this last Friday and we ALL loved it.  I always knew that dogs are very sensitive to human needs and emotions. This dog is so loveable and is so tuned into our human failings and feelings. We can learn a lot from this loving and very intelligent dog.  Too bad many of us humans do not know this.<br /><br />I have never been interested in race car driving but I found that interesting and I learned a lot about this sport that I did not know.<br /><br />There is another edition for children.  There are some dog type behaviors in the adult version of the book that might be disturbing for children and these are left out in the young people's edition. We adults know that there are certain types of behaviours that are just what animals do in order to survice on their own in their natural habitat. Children will learn to know this in time as they get older.<br /><br />Good book!  I am going to read it again.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|Man, if only some people with more vision and ability directed and produced films like this to fruition. It had a lot of promise and is surely not a bad film at all, but it could have been a masterpiece with a more subtle approach. As is I still highly recommend it for kids and adults.<br /><br />The romantic interest of the two teens and the schism between the two families was very interesting. The locations, oh wow, were just fantastic and just gave it that really cool retro childhood vibe. The whole thing was coming together nicely and I thought hey how did I miss this.... And then they start showing too much of the monster. And then the girl gets in trouble. And then it just kind of turns into a weird monster battle but I guess.... It could have been something a lot less modern and in your face and it could have rode that special train of subtlety in film to something far greater.<br /><br />I don't think the monster needed to be so big and nor do I think it needed to destroy half the town. It could have been something smaller and more realistic. The cubes making up the ship and the thing just wanting to go home was a nice touch, but I think it all went a little too far by the end and turned into a typical monster movie. Anyway, it is a pretty good film and should entertain the kids and family for a bit. A little too much of that schmaltz again from Spielberg but all in all I enjoyed my time with it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. You can build anything in creative mode and in survival survive on the resources around you. I love minecraft more than block story by ALOT. Still' I reccomend buying the computer version. That's the real mc and it has more features and items :) have fun on this app!
B008XG1X18|5.0|As a Pre school teacher, I find Pinterest extremely helpful.  I have connected with several other teachers by sharing craft ideas and other classroom activities.  It has saved me a lot of time searching for new ideas on the internet and putting a lesson plan together!
0152023984|5.0|It's a really great book showing child's point of view on life, showing how we, adults can make easy things so complicated! Love that book!!!
0316228532|1.0|I admit, I give up, I surrender!! Rarely do I give up on a book. I plod on even if I am not overjoyed by the writing, the plot, etc. But, life is too short & the books on my shelf to be read piled too high to spend any more time on this book. This author has gone from writing the most interesting wizardry books ever, to writing about the most boring town in the world filled with the most boring people in the world. It is just not interesting!! With all of the vampire and witch books out there, why didn't she dip her toes into something for adults with some fantasy. I hope someone on Ebay wants to buy this, because I certainly wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|it would have been better if there were more clues in game as to where tongo next, I had tonrely on the hint button a lot more than I usually do.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This comment is not on the book...from what my kids have said, it is a good entry into the series.  My concern is with the e-book itself.<br /><br />I got the book so my kids could read it on their iPad...it turns out that several illustrations were missing in the iPad...I then downloaded it to my Kindle Fire and was able to verify that there were pages where there were illustrations that were missing in the iPad...I went as far as deleting the book from the iPad device and re-downloading, with the same results. Seems like the problem is with the Kindle for iPad version of the book, not with the book itself.<br /><br />I am disappointed that Amazon did not do quality validation on this product.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was definitely a page Turner and was not much like the movie. It was a very good book.
1400162556|1.0|I got this title on audiobook and found the narrator's voice so irritating that I couldn't listen past disc 2. The book itself is only mildly interesting, but I would have kept with it if the reader's voice was pleasant. Instead, she often sounds like a snotty know-it-all, which is ironic, since so much of the information the author imparts is obvious, common-sense stuff. When she's not a know-it-all she sounds condescending or like an automaton. I have never heard an audiobook read by someone with such an unpleasant, monotone voice.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I just started playing, but it's an entertaining game. I'm not crazy about the Facebook interface to get points, but I can live with that. Having played the game for awhile now...  still fun, but lots of tapping.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Pretty accurate and easy to use. loads better than some of the other apps. Multiple locations can be chosen along with single or 10 day forcasts.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|This Movie is so cute! BHC 3 is the best..  Do u remember Erin Cahill? She played Jen Scotts in Power Rangers Time Force, I like Papi, Chole, And All The Dogs! Rosa gets left out of the pack but shows her self that she is all that.  Do u like this?
1423140605|5.0|my son has read all of rick riordan's books and children's series and was wild to get the mark of Athena as soon as it came out.<br />It is book three of the heroes of Olympus series.<br />this series continues the plot elements of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series adding more characters and mythological elements.<br />It makes mythology come alive and my son has a great love of ancient history partly inspired by rick riordan.<br />I highly recommend this for young readers.<br />(Whenever my son is done with these books, I read tham with great enjoyment as well.)<br />It is humorous, fun and has interesting elements for boys and girls with strong male and female characters.<br />Bravo Rick Riordan for another well done tale--more please

B000QRIGLC|5.0|My uncle recommended this book and I'm glad he did.  it was awesome and humbling to hear about the story of an American hero, his upbringing and influences.  I'm awed by the determination and focus despite difficulties.  I've been working abroad 20 years in humanitarian service so my work is quite difference from his, but I admire it nonetheless.  I'm glad he was able to show a good side to a people amidst war, the types of people that I encounter more often than he does but he mentioned them with admiration and appreciation for also sacrificing themselves to save his life.<br />i also can feel his pain about liberal media and how it influences us so much in doing what we know to be right at the time.  It's a shame that they have that much influence.  Thanks for the courage to write this story.
B00001QEE7|5.0|The dvd arrived in a timely manner. The dvd itself was in perfect condition. The movie was amazing. Glad I have the Limited Issue, closest to the original i saw as a kid :)
B000SEJHRA|3.0|This was recommended by some friends who were commenting about \\"the Rooster\\", which I did find funny.  The book is simply that, superficial funny anecdotes.  A guy rambling and humorizing about some of what were probably embarrassing and difficult periods of his life.... at his own expense.  Directionless and pointless but funny.
B0094M2OPY|5.0|If you've never read a real fairy tale, one where some oddly horrible things happen but it winds up being...sort of ok, then don't watch this.<br />This has STYLE, and in spades, plus a great story. The style may throw you off, but I think most people will really like it.<br />It's a grand story, good for Halloween, Christmas, or even May Day, if you aren't holiday conscious. I think that anyone should see it at least once, and most should watch it more often.

B008RZF2I0|5.0|Kamelot never fail to impress me! It is with this album that they continue to utilize their musical prowess with the introduction of their new singer, Tommy Karevik. Some may say that his style might not go as well with Kamelot as that of his predecessor, Roy Khan, while others say that he more than holds his own. From my own standpoint, I have to side with the latter view, seeing as Tommy is definitely not a novice in the scene of power metal and progressive metal. Given his background experience with Seventh Wonder (who are also amazing), I seriously do not think Kamelot could have made a better choice in hiring him.<br /><br />Right from start to finish, this album swept me right off my feet, as every song exhibited the pure richness, fullness, and sheer power and emotion that defines what Kamelot are all about. The thundering pulse of the drums, the crunching, yet flowing speed of the guitars and bass, along with the beautiful and soaring keyboards and orchestration all make for a powerful sound that can uplift and the listener, giving them an overwhelming sense of strength, confidence and empowerment. Like I said, Tommy, as the new singer, more than holds his own with such a powerful, dramatic sound. I will agree that he is not the same as Roy Khan, but I strongly stand by the fact that he is just as amazing in his own way, and I really do not think that Kamelot could have hired anyone better.<br /><br />Like a lot of the great recent bands that exist out there, Kamelot unfortunately managed to escape my radar for the longest time, thanks to all that brainwashing mainstream junk (i.e. Nickelback, Fall Out Boy, Linkin Park, etc.) that has been polluting the media for the last 10 years or so. That is why I am so glad I discovered these guys, along with many other bands and artists out there who make music that actually has a credible amount of artistic value. Overall, Kamelot are one of the best bands out there, and they never stop making great music. Keep it up the great work, Kamelot! Keep the goods coming!!! \m/\m/the great work, Kamelot! Keep the goods coming!!! \m/\m/
B0097EWK3A|5.0|REALLY enjoyed this one! Probably one of the best hidden objects games I've played. Graphics and story line are done quite well. Highly recommend. Hope the sequel is as enjoyable as this one. AND PLEASE RELEASE THE SEQUEL ASAP!!! I keep looking for it!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I travel with my fire in my purse and I am comfortable that it is safe and sound with the cover.  And the cover is beautiful and I always can find where I left my kindle!
B004P7CMZA|5.0|It went very smooth. Im just trying to write at least 20 works because I have no more to say.<br />Hopfully this is it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book was so good the charachers were so very real to me that i had a hard time putting the book down. Its not your everyday book but if your like me its a book that will keep you reading instead of looking for the next.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|They've put a lot of work into this but has no training or instructions. Really? If you've never played with simulation games this isn't for you. What a waste. Uninstalled after crashing for the 7th time. I tried.
B008L1VZS6|5.0|I was greatly surprised how good the production of [[ASIN:B008L1VZS6 Un Giorno Di Regno]was. I did not have high expectations, but I saw a good review of it. The reason for low expectations was that this opera was considered a failure at the time it was presented at La Scala. There are possible explanations, such as this comic opera followed the deaths of his two small children and wife in a two year period. Perhaps, it was the production or the fact that this opera has much of Rossini in the style. It is a combination of Verdi and Rosini styles. Out of 26 operas, this one was only one of two comic operas by Verdi, the other the last of his, Falstaff - a tremendous success.<br /><br />Having set the foundation why I had low expectations, I was greatly surprised by the production. It had a good story, great music, great singing and acting. It was a great surprise and I would recommend this opera to anyone who enjoys Italian opera.
B00936A0ZW|2.0|Huge fan of Paul, but prefer his rock stuff. Great album just not to my taste.  Hope he comes out with a rock album soon.
B004RX03NK|5.0|Great technicality and finesse. Vocals are amazing; low and gritty and high/emotional when they need to be. An amazing album. Most people call them thrash but to limit these guys to just thrash metal is an injustice.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|there are a lot of shows new and old ones and this is nothing new but is well done and many levels!! producing, writers and acting is good even with the sexy wife.
B0081BU42O|5.0|Finally...a book about the Sublime process.  It's hinted about here and there in his other books, but this is the closest we get to \\"what it is.\\"  Love the characters and worlds created in this novel.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I downloaded this shortly after midnight 11/19, and this morning I am on the 2nd listen.  Phillip wrote 9 of the 12 tracks on this album, and I am so impressed with the lyrics, the melodies, harmonies, instrumental arrangements.......not to mention that I liked his voice from the very beginning; but he is not just a singer, he is a true musician.  I was a Phillip Phillips fan from the very beginning of last season's AI, and knew he would be the contestant whose album I would want to own.  It is the reward for everyone who voted for him.  This being a first album, I am sure he has a fantastic career ahead of him, and I can't think of anyone more deserving.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|this was a great change of pace movie that was funny and had us laughing throughout.  I can't understand why this movie wasn't giving more advertizing because it's well worth the viewing.
B00932A2MC|4.0|An interesting mix of current day and cold war era tactics featured with WWII and new naval hardware. The acting and the scripts in a few of the romatic scenes were difficult to believe so you just had to remind yourself its only a movie.  A bit of a tribute to our military veterans, which adds a nice touch and alone makes the movie worth watching.  Overall it was fun to watch.
B0098VXE50|5.0|this was a super and intense movie, it kept me on pins and needles wondering what was going to happen next. I thought it was a different approach to the Snow White fable we all grew up with. The special FX were great. This one has to be put on our family movie night.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Multi translation and great readings can be reminded when it is time to read and very quick. Never locks up.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|There's something about this movie that just makes me love it. The way Battleship the game was worked into Battleship the movie was clever. There are some holes in the plot, but this adds to the discussion value. Very enjoyable.
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|I owned video but decided I also wanted DVD as I'm a fan of all the creative athings Johnny Depp does in his films.  I thought it was quite an exciting suspenseful movie that takes place in the U.S. and Europe.  But, it never seemed to get much attention , which really surprised me.  While I would never want to try it, trying to connect with the devil seemed an intriguing topic.  What a surprise, when it turns out to be a woman.  I only noticed Johnny Depp in the first Pirate movie, but after that wanted to see all his films, so buy all of them.  I was surprised the film was so cheap.  That biography book should have been cheap.  There was nothing new in it.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Shades of \\"Top Gun\\"s homoerotic motif. Brothas be dancing better than that all the time. What's so special about this guy? I don't see the magic. His furniture was butt ugly. I'm supposed to believe this guy's an interior decorator, a construction worker and a dancer? Puh leeze.

B001EC2ISA|4.0|good movie. It has a good plot and made me laugh. I'd watch it again for sure! Such a laugh
1451662432|1.0|I have always enjoyed Arnold's movies . I felt like he had good moral values and looking from the outside, a good marriage and beautiful family. Why he would just throw it all away so easily for a fling with his housekeeper. I know he worked hard during his body building contests but I can't help but notice how full of himself he is.What an EGO! I hate that I've lost a lot of the \\"fan love\\" I had for him. Especially after I read the part about how he felt and treated people as governor.  I'm glad I'm not living in California.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I've read the \\"Pillars\\" series and loved every character!  I wasn't able to put this book down either!  From feisty Maud and Ethel to pompous earls and tsars, these characters are believable.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Brad Pitt does a fantastic job in this movie along with christoph Waltz. I have seen the movie 3x and everytime its as good as it was the first.<br /><br />QT does it again!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|My cousin told me about the program on public television and she raved about it. I decided to purchase the first 2 seasons and see what it was all about. I loved it and am hooked.  If you liked Upstairs, Downstairs on public television you will love this.

B004V5A7K8|4.0|A classic fun game that has a twist on the original. Too challenging sometimes because of game speed and responsiveness.
B00004ZKVM|5.0|I stole this cassette from my Dad when I was in high school.....the best doors compilation ever...and of course I was playing it for the millionth time and it was eaten by my tape player. I have been searching for it ever since....I had no idea it was so rare. Such a bummer.
B001IXXYBA|2.0|Speaking as a Protestant,I can't say that I agree with the concept of this film.Most of it is based more on Catholic kind of beliefs.So if you're a Catholic...enjoy.But,if you're a born-again Christian Protestant like me,you'll probally wouldn't like this neither.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|this game is  ok it could be better though so can u make some changes for it to be better it is just an ok game for now.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I was a bit shocked in the first few chapters by the adult themes - they almost felt forced, coming from an author famous for exclusively youth novels. However, Rawlings does a great job of drawing the reader into this little town and its complex web of residents. At the halfway point, I got ravenous for the next page and I'm LOVING the 2nd half of the book!
B009LK6JS2|1.0|LEARN IT BAITCHES. Grammar is horrible, and u cannot understand half of it.If it had better grammar I might try this game out.

B0068FYZIO|4.0|schindler's list is a timeless story of the Holocaust, where a man whom once only had notions to capitalize on the circumstances of his surroundings suddenly has a change of heart. Schindler was a proud and covetous German man of affairs. He opened up a factory of all jewish workers, they worked for little to no profit at all. The setting of film is 1940s Poland, under Nazi rule and control, which was good for business seeing that Jewish freedom became more and more slim to not existant. Although taking advantage of Jewish labor was very profitable to Oskar Schindler, it ultimately was not nearly as close to the worth of the agony that was dealt upon the Judaic community. Seeing the Jews being slain in many different and horrible ways \\"flipped a switch\\" sort of speak, in Schindler. Now a reformed man with a new level of sympathy towards the Jews, what was once a factory that only served the purpose as a place of hard work for jews was now something like a sanctuary. Creating a list of who all now inhabbited the \\"sanctuary\\", Schindler's list presented over eleven hundred names of jewish residents he had single handedly saved from gas chambers. Oskar Schindler showed that we all have a little good in us. Eventhough this is a story of Hebraism there were still some qualities of christian ethics integrated within this film, for instence, giving up the materialistic for a conscience spirit. Oskar gave up the probability of being wealthy to save the lives of those not as fortunate.

B000RN61UI|5.0|\\"Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell\\" is the first door into a variety of research topics including: Psychodelic drugs generally, the unethical research done by the C.I.A. during their MKULTRA project (see \\"In Search of the Manchurian Candidate\\" by John Marks) and the spiritual \\"trips\\" of Native traditions, (see \\"The Teachings of Don Juan\\" by Carlos Castaneda).Doors of Perception is an intelligently written work of art.
B007V65R54|5.0|First, note that Mr. Silver's prediction about the 2012 election was spot on.  He predicted a better than \\"close\\" election where even political professionals thought it would be closer than it was.  Of course, his book is about more than just this election.  It shows how we (all) tend to blind ourselves through our individual biases and - most importantly (at least to me) - how today's \\"news\\" environment is causing us to be surprised when things don't go the way we expect.  Whether you are a devotee of Fox News or MSNBC, this book shows you need to broaden your listening (if not your views) lest things get worse.  While I don't know that the Fox versus the Hedgehog is the best descriptor for the personality types, his view that we need to look at everything before we come to conculusions makes sense.  More importantly, unless we do that we run the risk of losing our ability to tell the difference between noise and fact.

B009ERK1T0|5.0|I'd have to say, this is the best hard rock album of 2012, gotta be.  Listen, I tend to..ah... 'get' my music 'for free', if you know what I mean.  CD, download, whatever, this album is worth your money.  If I paid for it, that's telling you somethign.  Consistent with everything they've done before, the Deftones have somehow got even better.  If you're not a fan of deftones, then obviously this won't change your mind.  But even if you 'kind of, sorta' like Deftones, this album will knock you on your @--.  Grab some headphones, find a comfortable place to sit and just listen.  BUY IT!!!
B007EE5820|5.0|I'm enjoying this book, it's very true and real. Arnold is one of my heroes, I love body builders and their world. in the book I can live the moment of hard work-out in a gym and feel the stress of a competition. I suggest this book to a dedicated reader, that loves Arnold's world. it is very sincere and he is not afraid to give intimate details of his life, faults he did and also if he was stupid. it's a great man and a great, big book.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It's about what you would expect from the third book of any trilogy. It wraps things up nicely but not as good as the first.
B001EC3JME|4.0|I have a medium-size flashlight and had trouble finding a holster that would fit it. This holster seemed a bit big at first but turned out to be the perfect size. Elastic is very tight - it's tough to get a flashlight in there at first, but it stretches to fit any size and once it's in you can trust that it is very secure and won't fall out. Probably wouldn't be good if you were frequently taking a flashlight out of it and wanting to be able quickly replace it. I just leave mine in it permanently. The clip is strong and sturdy, and the rotation is excellent - I clip it to my belt and rarely have to take it off, usually just rotate it to a good angle and it will stay there. Great for hands-free work and walking.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|its actuly fun its just like mindcraft. but the game is really short its like about 15min or20 min idont know for sure but its fun
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I thought about paying the extra hundreds of dollars for the collectors editions but after reading reviews went with the cheaper option.  It's not a set you will put on display on your shelf at home, but if all you really want is a full set with all the movies, this is the way to go.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|This is a fun game. My son and other small children love it. I like that u can tilt the screen as well as u touch screen to move the player. Its exciting to beat the game and unlock other levels.

B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I never have listed to DMB or others.  I first heard PP on AI.  We will always be left to wonder how differently he might have done things if healthy.  I have always respected his talent and creativity.  This album was produced quickly (per media stories in just a couple weeks).  I have listened 3 times through, and am enjoying the music.  Home is such an addictive song.  In time, I know there are others that will follow that pattern.  Thanks PP for an awesome first album.  Stay true to yourself, and produce some more great music for us fans.  So far, you have EARNED your success.  Keep it up.
B007SGM084|5.0|Just finished he 3rd book. When I started it,my friends said it was a chick book. Putting the sex aside I enjoyed the character development carried out through all three books. Ana developed into a real person that should make her creator proud. Will re read in a few months to pick up some of the \\"shading\\" that I may have missed the first time through.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book:) The characters were easy to get attached too and I definitely wanted more...I even bought some Avett Brothers music because the characters liked then so much. I hope she continues the series after Point of Retreat...

B003TNM2ME|5.0|The Mist is a movie that investigates the behaviors of people when a catastrophe strikes.<br />I watched this movie during Hurricane Sandy on my kindle fire- when I had no power, heat or hot water. It was very eerie and it was not a unthinkable to believe my neighbors friends, family and possibly my self could make the decisions some of the characters had to make if our situation was just as dire.<br /><br />The film is was made before CGI revolutionized special effects but, in some scenes it didn't matter. I am not a fan of CGI but I couldn't help wondering how it would look if the film was remade.<br /><br />In general Stephen King annoys me but I have to say that the Mist is one of my favorite films.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I believe in the right to free speech and I do not believe this book divulged any military secrets. It was an interesting read but not a nail-biter.

0446580848|1.0|Did anyone else know that British Air(sic) flew London to Cairo..? No, me neither. It's Airways, Nelson, not Air, f'r Chris'sakes! Jeez, what the hell happened to basic research? Sorry about the Air(sic), by the way. I didn't realize it would be a bad play on words until I'd typed the damned thing. What was I thinking? That I was John Corey making another inane wisecrack?<br /><br />I note that the negative reviews the book has attracted have all referred to Corey's ( or, to put it more bluntly, the author's) woeful attempt to inject a humorous one-liner into just about every damned paragraph. This got beyond a joke. Sixty pages in and I was ready to hurl the book through the window.<br /><br />Seventy pages in, to avoid a heavy glazing bill - have you seen the size of the book? - I used the wall instead.<br /><br />One hundred pages in, I finally gave up.<br /><br />The Panther is just awful. Well written, it ain't. Thrilling, it ain't. No likeable characters either, sadly. Not even the main protagonist, Corey, who has become ever more irritating with each successive novel. It does make you wonder about the man being sent on a secret mission to Yemen when he doesn't appear to speak Arabic.<br /><br />I note it comes in at 625 pages. If you cut out the travelogue and the attempted throwaway lines, a good editor could have pared the thing down to around 400. In other words, you could have thrown away the throwaways ( er, sorry about that - it must be catching ) and you might have had a better book. I stress the word `might'. Somehow I doubt it.<br /><br />I was a firm fan of DeMille's up until John Corey came on the scene. The first couple of yarns were fine and then, oh dear, it all went downhill. Sad to say, I probably won't be investing in him again.<br /><br />Very disappointing. And I write that with regret.<br /><br />Mind you, the cover has the quote: \\"`A true Master' Dan Brown.\\"<br /><br />That should have warned me.

B001AQR39O|4.0|I ♥ Hank - and while the content of Season 2 is not my favorite of the series - my review is of the DVD, not the programming.<br /><br />Seasons 1, 3, and 4 come in \\"Season Style\\" cardboard boxes with separate slender DVD cases. Season 2 is a standard dual-sided single case. However, the differences extend to the DVD.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The discs do not appear to restrict any player functionality. As opposed to seasons 1 & 3, you can skip the Showtime intro/rebate offer and also utilize your DVD players skip functionality throughout.<br />-The quality is exactly what you would expect and doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The bonus features are limited, if you care about that. And there's one episode with commentary featuring Pamela Adlon by herself. Awkward.<br />-The case feels cheap. But it's just the case.<br /><br />Relative to the other seasons, I prefer the functionality of these discs (or permissions) and prefer the box-set style of the other seasons packaging. Would still take this, though, to be able to fast forward through the obligatory intros.

B009AMANBA|5.0|On January 31, 1865, the House of Representatives passed the proposed Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution which outlawed slavery and involuntary servitude within the United States, except in punishment for a crime.  The Senate had passed the Amendment earlier, in April, 1864, and the Amendmenr became law upon ratification by the required number of states in December 1865.  President Lincoln, just beginning his second term, played a critical role in securing the House passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, both openly and behind the scenes.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg's new movie \\"Lincoln\\" covers the last four months of the president's life and focuses upon his activities in ending slavery through the Thirteenth Amendment. The movie is a historically-informed account,  It draws in part on Doris Stearns Goodwin's book \\"Team of Rivals: the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln.\\" Several renowned Lincoln and Civil War scholars served as consultants to the film.<br /><br />The settings of the movie have a period feel, with much of the filming done in Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia. The performances bring to life their subjects, particularly that of Daniel Day-Lewis.  He captures Lincoln's high pitched verbal twang, his humor, political savvy, wisdom, and melancholy loneliness. Sally Fields gives an effective performance in the difficult role of Lincoln's complexly difficult wife, Mary Todd. The movie includes a large cast of historical personages, including Lincoln's cabinet, many members of the House and Senate, Confederate political leaders, Generals including Grant and Lee, Lincoln's sons, and Elizabeth Keckley, a former slave who became Mary Lincoln's dressmaker and friend.<br /><br />The movie interweaves the military and political events involved in the Thirteenth Amendment with Lincoln's personal life. It shows how consideration of the Amendment became tied to a peace conference between Lincoln and a Confederate delegation held at Hampton Roads late in the Civil War. As the movie develops, the enactment of the Thirteenth Amendment required the votes of 20 Democrats in the House. Many in Lincoln's cabinet despaired of its passage and advised the president not to push the matter. But Lincoln pushed on.<br /><br />In many scenes of the movie, Lincoln speaks eloquently about the need for the Amendment and about its relationship to the Emancipation Proclamation which Lincoln had signed on January 1, 1863.  In addition to the scenes of idealism and commitment, the movie is about the rough and tumble business of American politics. Lincoln told his operatives to do what they needed to do to secure the votes, and they did. There are many scenes in the film of horse trading and chicanery. There are highly realistic and rancorous debate scenes involving many members on the floor of the House.<br /><br />Concluding portions of the movie touch briefly on Appatomatox and upon Lincoln's assassination.<br /><br />The movie is thoughtful and historically informed.  It held my attention throughout.<br /><br />The movie offers an inspiring portrayal of an American hero. It shows the combination of idealism and rawness in Lincoln and in the American political sytstem of his time. I hope this movie about Lincoln may help us  understand and appreciate our common past and prepare, with all our differences, to move forward.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanil War.

B008O9V4C2|4.0|I have been a Steely Dan fan from the 70's and a Donald Fagen fan since the Night Fly so I really wanted to like this work. My intial impression was that Sunken Condos did not measure up to the Night Fly but the more I listened the better it got, it grew on me. While I still don't think this latest work is as good as some of Donald's earlier music I'm glad to have it. Would I buy it again..........in a heartbeat.
006197806X|3.0|Pandemonium and I have a rocky relationship. It took me like two days to get through 150 pages. Finally, about halfway through the book, things started to pick up, and at least become more interesting, but at the end of the day, I'm still not crazy about the book.<br /><br />The story switches between two different time periods: \\"then\\" (immediately after book two) and \\"now\\" (a few months later). At first I didn't really like all the jumping back and forth, but I quickly grew accustomed to it. It is interesting to be able to compare and contrast Lena from then and Lena now, and see how she grows and changes.<br /><br />I have two big problems with Pandemonium . My first problem is that I feel like nothing happens until the last 50 pages. The first part of the book is just a bunch of travelling, waiting, meeting a few new people, more travelling, clawing through the Wilds, waiting in some sort of underground holding cell, more waiting, a bit of talking... You get the picture. To be blunt: it was boring.<br /><br />And my next big problem is Julian. The author didn't make me fall in love with him. Somehow Lena did, but I didn't. And honestly, I don't even know why Lena thinks she loves Julian. If you ask me, she only \\"loves\\" him due to 1) a lack of options and 2) she so desperately misses Alex and wants that emotional closeness that she's clinging onto the first new guy her age that comes along. I feel like there wasn't even a falling in love phase; Lena just woke up one day and decided she loved Julian. They had like 5 half-mumbled conversations throughout the whole book and suddenly they're in love? Okay, they saved each others' lives once.. but there wasn't that sweet, passionate, slow-brewing romance that we had in Delirium. In Delirium, Lena and Alex had 'moments'. They had cute scenes where they fell in love. They shared poetry, adventure, stories, memories. With Julian, I felt like Lena just shared two nights with him in a prison cell and one night in a bed and then suddenly they were head over heels for each other... Where did that come from?<br /><br />Pandemonium does end on a huge cliffhanger, but it didn't totally wow me for the sole reason that I saw it coming. It is pretty easy to guess what happens. Although I am really curious to see how the story progresses, I was missing that big *BANG* of an ending because I wasn't shocked or shaken.<br /><br />Ultimately, Pandemonium felt very much like that second-book-in-a-trilogy filler book. It was all about biding time until we can wrap things up in book three. To be fair, the last quarter of Pandemonium was entertaining--it wasn't boring like the first half was. My main problem with the book is just that I got zero passion from Lena's relationship with Julian, and that was the biggest part of the book.then suddenly they were head over heels for each other...

My main problem with the book is just that I got zero passion from Lena's relationship with Julian, and that was the biggest part of the book.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|This app simply didn't work.<br />None of the three times I tried re-installing it.<br />Its possible it will work for someone else, but it would simply shut sown on me and never actually opened my kindle. I'm not sure what happened, but it ended up never working. I would say check to see if your phone is going to  work with it, but otherwise its not really worth the download.

B00005N6KG|1.0|I typically do not leave reviews on anything, much less a Sony item.  I'm usually a big fan of Sony. These headphones however, are crap.  They arrived, and right out of the box one ear does not work!  WORTHLESS!  So, in order to get my $8.63 back, I have to pack these up drive to UPS, and pay to ship them back.  Not worth my time, effort, or money.  Sometimes a cheap price just isn't worth it.  You get what you pay for.  I bought some JVC headphones for about $25 and they're great.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As usual, great book.  So nice to buy a book that actually takes more than 2 hours to read, unlike the 50 books a year James Patterson pays people to write for him.  Much thanks to Cornwell for respecting her readers enough to put time and thought into her books.  I'll buy everything she writes.
1400049628|5.0|This book is a masterpiece. I picked it up mostly as a token item to help with my infatuation with zombie movies. The satirical style in which it follows survival oriented literature is a hoot, and as the author intended makes you seriously consider 'Am I prepared for the zombie apocalypse or (insert catastrophe here)?'<br /><br />I can honestly say thanks to the easy to read style, well done critique of nearly every conceivable zombie related environment you could imagine, and dozens of helpful tips on how to defeat the undead, this book got me into prepping. No not for the zombie apocalypse! The style is one which makes you think 'What if I got stranded on my own? What if the power was out for days on end? What if a riot overtook my part of town?' and it's these various 'what if' scenarious that allow you to honestly examine these ideas from a non-judgemental point of view with friends and family.<br /><br />So if this book can get more people into prepping I say great! It gives you some laughs along the way and lets you unwind after a busy day. Buy this book, suggest it to your friends, have fun with it!

0307346617|4.0|I bought this book after buying Max Brooks other fabulous work, The Zombie Survival Guide. Needless to say it was an item that got me seriously starting to think about prepping (no not for zombies, get your heads out of the horror bucket!)<br /><br />This book is a wonderfully detailed story of how the zombie plague spread around the world and caught the human race unknowing, unready, and most sadly of all, unwilling to face the zombie plague. Told in a series of interviews with survivors and decision makers from this time of darkness is follows some very personal accounts of the hardship, struggle, and sacrifice necessary to turn the tide against the undead hordes.<br /><br />We get an excellent look at how the response to the zombies is initially mishandled and how humanity finally regrouped and saved the day. It's not all sunshine and rainbows though, the world is devastated by the zombie menace and we srape through by the skin of our teeth and the world after is one which has various sad calamities still aflicting it.<br /><br />All in all this is a great post-apocalyptic novel. If you like zombies (and aren't too hung up on realism, because come on, ZOMBIES!) and watching humanity pull through you will love this novel.<br /><br />My only real criticism is that in the ending we needed just a bit better view of the post-zombie world and how it was organized, what the priorities were and how the zombies had changed our outlook on life as a whole. Other than that I can happily say it was a cracking good novel.

0060873175|1.0|This book is not worth the paper it is printed on.  The plot is erratic, the characters are wooden and predictable, and the action is poorly written.

B007UW9WOQ|5.0|Saw this movie, and besides the hankering for mediocre sushi available around my house - what was most striking to me was the pinpoint focus of the art - of creating sushi.  How many of us can say that we are masters at anything?  I certainly can't - and it made me sad about what that means for my legacy.  I don't think that Jiro Ono thought that he was going to be a world-renowned master sushi chef with a 3 Michelin star restaurant 50 years ago - but there is something to be said about keeping your eye on the ball - and perfecting something most would appreciate even if you were mildly adequate at it.  Getting it done right is not enough - doing something correctly and improving upon high standards should always be the goal.  It made me appreciate a master, and shine a light on ways I should improve on my own tasks and build from there.  5 stars!<br /><br />PS - and for those who mention how soulless the son looks at times at having to work at his father's chosen career - the Japanese are famous for passing down traditions in trades and Karoshi.  It's part of the package deal.  Someone else chooses your trade, and work yourself to death making sure your improve upon it.  Maybe that's why they have a less than 5% unemployment rate...

0307341577|5.0|Wow! I just finished reading and can't believe how entranced I was by this story. Be prepared to NOT want to stop reading.<br /><br />I read \\"Sharp Objects\\" and really liked it, but this book was even \\"better\\". But, for this author, \\"better\\" means more vile, disgusting, grimy, gross, and gritty. So many adjectives describe this novel. Even though I'm essentially a \\"California Girl\\", I know enough about the midwest to relate to the horrific possibilities that could occur, and Flynn draws on so many creepy images that it's important to read every word. It's so strange how fascinating the seedy side of life can be. I'd sure rather experience it in a novel than in my own life, but there were occasional low moments that I must admit could relate. I guess we all have a few \\"dark places\\". The characters are not very likable and extremely frustrating. The Day family is a perfect, pathetic disaster, BUT by the end there's a spark of hope. I loved the ending, as I did in \\"Sharp Objects\\", because Flynn ties up all loose ends and leaves you with plenty to think about.<br /><br />I'll be reading \\"Gone Girl\\" soon, but I have to take a breather first - these books are so intense.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|ive had this game for a long time and I love it! It also has never crashed my kindle fire. (lots of games do) ^.^
B00A6N7BS0|1.0|There is nothing about this movie I can recommend. The plot is never believable at any point. The characters are cliche with no depth. The production values are good, but it's all for nothing.<br />It starts with a voice over where \\"O\\" tells you what kind of movie it is. She explains your assumptions are wrong. She's right in my case. I assumed Oliver Stone could still make a decent movie.<br />Characters are introduced. It's all very dramatic and silly. \\"O\\" is a rich girl with daddy issues. You also have your war scarred soldier, hippy world savior, ruthless cartel strong man, corrupt law officer, hacker, etc.<br />The hippy grows the best weed in the world! He wants more from life, though. He and the soldier love each other and run a successful marijuana cultivation company. They both love O. They are all so happy in their love triangle, but the cartel wants in on their business. Bro-mance don't want to deal and O pays the price.<br />Bro-mance is willing to do anything to rescue O. They love her SO MUCH! This is possibly the most absurd part. This amazing woman spends her days getting high, shopping, and having sex with Bro-mance. The only back story you get is that her father is absent, her mother is often away, she's rich, and has been using drugs since she was 14. She's a spoiled drug addict with daddy issues who has never done anything with her life because she didn't have to. What a rare find in California! She gets kidnapped because she has to go to the mall one more time before they all flee the ruthless cartel. Seriously. The cartel's strong man, who has been watching the threesome, isn't sure if Bro-mance loves her or if she is just a prostitute. You wouldn't know either if O didn't tell you. Apparently love is getting high and having sex. He calls his boss hundreds of miles away and says as much. She immediately knows this is just the leverage the cartel needs. How? She just does, okay?<br />Lots of people die in horrible ways and the story progresses to the worst ending I've ever seen. You might find it poignant if you're a teenager, but most people will just laugh. I was laughing while O explained that's not what happened. What really happened is only the second worst movie ending I've ever seen.o the worst ending I've ever seen. You might find it poignant if you're a teenager, but most people will just laugh.

B0091QSNEE|5.0|I am sad to see the bad reviews for this game. When the animals get out the taxi click them, then click them again to seat them. Think like a toddler, they click everything lol.<br /><br />Also, this game (or any game) is NOT supposed to replace real life activities, life lessons or interactions. They are games, for fun. My 2 1/2 year old helps me in the kitchen everyday. She loves to sit at night and play this game duplicating what she has been doing in the kitchen.<br /><br />It's a great game. I have this, vet and purchased daycare earlier. They are by far my favourite toddler apps for having fun. She learns from play and at the end of the day gets rewarded with these apps from tribe play. Well, she chooses the apps. I sit with her and explain how she is making the animals feel better or making the strawberries into a milkshake and I ask her to identify fruits and utensils and animals.
0345803507|4.0|This book is the conclusion to the Fifty Shades story,and while the tale has been compelling, the ending was not as expected. I expected more (of what, I'm not sure) being that the story is over. It was still a good read just wanted there to be so much more. I think a book 4 is necessary.

0061438294|5.0|This is a pretty good book. The last book that I read that was related to lie detection was \\"Telling Lies\\" by Paul Ekman. That book has been in print a lot longer than this one but has many fewer reviews (leading me to believe that it has sold many fewer copies and has many fewer readers). What makes this book decent?<br /><br />1. The ease of reading. The whole book can be read through in about 3 hours/ one afternoon. There is lots of white space and it keeps the eyes moving very easily. The \\"Telling Lies\\" book had SO MUCH waffle and just *dragged on* for such a long time that it felt like it went on for 6 months.<br /><br />2. There are lots of diagrams. A picture is worth 1,000 words, and the author saved a lot of writing by just *showing* us what he was saying instead of saying it.<br /><br />3. The writing was very light and easy, and 234 pages of prose went by like 120 (and so the book can easily be read twice in order to glean the last little bit of information that we missed).<br /><br />4. The total number of photographs was 90. That's plenty of illustrations to demonstrate what was being discussed--and cut down on the number of words used in description.<br /><br />5. The author brings to the table perspective in two ways: First with ACTUAL FIELD WORK as an FBI agent (and this is more practical, real-world experience than most psychologists have) and second as a second language speaker of English (when you go someplace and navigate in a second language, facial expression becomes a primary tool for understanding what people are saying). In fact, his real life experiences were richly detailed in the omnipresent Box Inserts.<br /><br />Navarro goes over the whole body bit from bottom to top, and he starts at the feet/ legs because (in his professional estimation) they are the most honest parts of the body and people don't learn to conceal their emotions in them. His single rationalizing theme was *the limbic system*. So, the rational part of your brain will tell you one thing to do but the automatic part of your brain will force you to behave in another way.<br /><br />Bad parts:<br /><br />1. There were no less than 58 (!) Box Inserts that gave illustrative stories, and that got annoying after a while (constantly having reading interrupted with these stories and then having to go back into the text to find out where you were again), but they were not so long that you couldn't read them and then not get right back to where you were before.<br /><br />2. Some of the things.....I just couldn't see where he was coming from (and that is fine, because there were so many assertions made that it would have been just too much to find a reference for *every single assertion*).<br /><br />Verdict: This book is worth the Kindle price as of this review ($9.99) and definitely worth a secondhand purchase. Worth the time, worth the money.ell you one thing to do but the automatic part of your brain will force you to behave in another way.<br /><br />Bad parts:<br /><br />1.

B00005RDRO|3.0|I was reading an article in Vanity Fair about Truman Capote and MURDER BY DEATH was mentioned so I thought it was time to see this film. The major plus of this film is the chance to see some beloved and popular actors..most of whom are long gone. Sadly, the younger generation may not recognize the names in this film and the great esteem these actors were held in. Several of the actors in MURDER BY DEATH had already been stars for decades when this film was released in 1976.<br /><br />So for those of us of a certain age, it is a joy to see several beloved actors \\"alive\\" again. What a dream cast with Petter Sellers, David Niven, Maggie Smith, Nancy Walker, Eileen Brennan, James Coco, Peter Falk and Eileen Brennan. There is also a young James Cromwell in the cast. Maggie Smith is still going strong as the grand dame of acting and it is fun to see her young and sexy. MURDER BY DEATH is based on a Neil Simon play so we know already it will be a great show. Each of the actors is doing a comedic take of literary and film detectives from the past. Peter Falk is hilarious as Humphrey Bogart/Sam Spade. There is Elsa Lanchester as Jessica Marbles. Peter Sellers is a totally send on Charlie Chan--making a politically incorrect even more incorrect. Of course, this is all in fun and is giving us a laugh on famous characters. David Niven and Maggie Smith are Dick and Dora Charleston. Again, you need to know classic film to get the joke here. I am afraid a lot of the humor could be lost on people not familiar with older films. There is James Coco as Milo Perrier. Coco is an actor I remember fondly who we lost too soon and who sadly, probably is not remembered by most today.<br /><br />I do feel the film loses steam once all the characters are introduced and we descend further and further into silliness. How do a blind butler and deaf mute maid communicate? But after a while, the joke is lost and we are replaying the same gags over and over. The film does seem very dated but of course, it is from the mid-70's. The real fun in this film is not the story as much as seeing some great actors together.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is simply amazing, one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. The author masterfully draws you in and you can't help but love his characters. I simply could not stop reading it once I began. I don't recall coming across a dull moment in the book, and the authors fantasy setting is stellar. (Magic is there, but you don't come across wizards hurling fireballs). The culture, religions, and politics of the book are all fairly well developed and the author relays the information about them to you in a very measured manner (eg. there is no incredibly long \\"history of the world\\" to read at the beginning of the book a la The Fellowship of the Ring). The book really is just astounding fantasy, I would highly recommend it to anyone. (and cannot wait for the next one to come out).

1451613512|1.0|Here we go again, for some reason there never ceases to be an audience for worn out Cold War revisionism. Whats in this book is a fairly old shtick: The entire Cold War could have been avoided had the United States cooperated with Stalin, who was a reasonable and peaceful man, and the entire premise for the conflict was created by paranoid reactionaries in the United States. You could argue that this sort of pseudo scholarship may have been defensible 25 years ago, but since the fall of the Soviet empire the sheer volume of documentary evidence that completely debunks this nonsense could fill several warehouses.<br /><br />Some examples of the more preposterous and easily debunked claims in the book: Had the US been nicer to Stalin in the 1930's (during the height of pruges), he never would have allied with Hitler, which was only done so the Soviets could prepare for the inevitable German invasion. Left out is the fact that the Soviets signed an extensive commercial agreement as part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop which helped the Germans evade the Allied blockade for 18 crucial months. The Soviet Union fought the Germans by themselves until Normandy. Left out are the African campaigns, Sicily, Italy and the air war over Europe. Stalin and North Korea invaded the south ONLY to prevent an invasion from the South. The Marshall Plan was nothing more than a deliberate provocation designed to enflame the Soviets and the Berlin Wall was actually a good thing and done for the best interests of peace.<br /><br />The book along with the documentary is full of this kind of material, but for all the \\"new looks\\" Stone and Kuznik give to established conventional historic wisdom, they still cant seem to stray very far from the left wing dogma on Hiroshima and Nagasaki which states that the bombs were unnecessary, the Japanese were looking to surrender, the war would be over in weeks without their use and the only reason they were used was to intimidate the Soviets. One of the most comprehensive books on the subject, \\"Japan's Longest Day\\", written by Japanese's historians using archive material and interviews with survivors, explains why the bombs were necessary. The Japanese cabinet alone had the power to surrender and the decision had to be unanimous. The hawks of the cabinet, Army Minister General Anami, Army Chief of Staff General Umezu and<br />Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Toyoda knew that the Potsdam declaration would allow them to keep their emperor and they also understood that victory over the US was impossible. The hawks believed that the Soviet entrance into the war, along with a costly guerilla campaign on the main islands, would force the US to offer terms more to their liking including possession of some overseas colonies and leaving the political structure they had become accustomed to intact. Although the emperor could have imposed his will on the hawks, he knew it would mean a military coup and his imprisonment. The hawks had no intention of stopping the war and their troops were fanatical .. a fact often left unmentioned. The atomic bombings decimated the hawks plans of a long term bloody guerilla war on the mainland because that forced them to acknowledge the reality that America didn't have to lose one soldier to annihilate the island.  I say bombings, because right after Hiroshima General Anami still refused to concede defeat arguing that America only had one weapon and wouldn't/couldn't use another. The bombing was directly responsible for Anami, Umezu, and Toyoda coming to table and endorsing surrender along the terms laid out in the Potsdam declaration.<br /><br />If there were a zero star option, I'd give it.prehensive books on the subject, \\"Japan's Longest Day\\", written by Japanese's historians using archive material and interviews with survivors, explains why the bombs were necessary.

B0025VX3BU|4.0|I bought the book on a suggestion from a friend.  This book is very dark and is not for the faint of heart.  However, it does have a moral component which isn't really obvious until the end.  To say this book is thought provoking is a huge understatement.

B009K0P10K|1.0|We like to watch, Revenge, the Amazon direct streaming is TOTALLY INFERIOR AND SUBSTANDARD. The sound is so low that I need to buy an amplifier just to hear it. We have 1320 Kbts way more than most people. Your streaming is very bad. Sometimes we loose picture as your streaming KBTS goes down whem more people log on. YOU NEED TO FIX YOUR SITE. WE HAVE NET FLIX which is totally perfect and work flawlessly. Whoever is incharge of your steaming needs to go back to school and learn the trade YOU RATE A VERY VERY VERY POOR

B009UX2YAC|2.0|My kid (10 years old) liked the game and even wanted to purchase some game coins, so he could buy some figure. This is where the problems started.<br /><br />After purchasing the coins through the game, we noticed that the credit of the game coins was not updated. Talking to the Amazon support I got refunded for the transactions, and was referred to the company who created the game for further help.<br /><br />I exchanged emails with the company, but they were slow in answering and provided no much help. They suggested that I restart the Kindle, and try again. This did not help, and I had to talk to the Amazon support again for getting credited.<br /><br />Bottom line -<br /><br />Amazon support was GREAT. The game is nice, however, not sure I recommend buying game coins. Might work, might not, and they it will be up to you to get refunded ...
0062183591|4.0|As a student enrolled in Carlow University's Masters of Science in Fraud and Forensics course on Forensic Research and Analysis. I was assigned to read Ariely's book: The (Honest) Truth about Dishonesty - How we Lie to Everyone-Especially Ourselves.    Readers will enjoy Ariely's creative approach to scientific testing and studies performed on human interactions and the basic assumptions and gut feelings we all live by; and whether we are correct or not in these beliefs. The results will leave readers surprised; forcing all to take pause and reconsider their actions in both their personal lives as well as their professional lives.    Throughout the book, Ariely \\"teaches\\" us overall that \\"everyone cheats a little bit.\\" However what I appreciated most about the book was Ariely, through his various and somewhat obscure test studies, demonstrates for us what factors shape this dishonesty.  This book provides a stark realization of how society accepts bad behavior on a small scale; as well as the psyche of human beings and the ability to rationalize bad behavior. By learning this information, we are able to adjust our thinking and actions in our everyday life to be better people, thus a better society overall. Having said that, I did not always agree with the interpreted results of Ariely's studies. Not having any experience in psychology or sociology I decided to accept the information as presented for purposes of gaining the lessons learned from each of the studies.  This information has provided a fundamental basis into \\"why people lie\\" as well as an introspective analysis for my own personal consideration. As a fraud investigator, the insights gained in this book will assist me with a better understanding why people act as they do and the motivating influences to their bad behavior.  Everyone will enjoy reading about \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" they lie; and even more, why it's ok.    Visit our program: MFF at Carlow University: [...]
B00992CF6W|5.0|i LOVE this game!!!! but i hav an ipod AND a kindle fire(this review is from my kindle), on the ipod a new  update came out, the 0.5.0 version, so i thought that an update would be on the kindle too, when i checked, nothing. BUY THIS GAME but dont be sad because theres no 0.5.0 update yet
B007NZDES0|5.0|After all these years they still have the magic.  A couple of new songs that makes the purchase worth while.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I've had this cover this for almost a year and use my Kindle daily.  It works great.  The Kindle snaps in solidly.  I wish the groove on the Kindle Fire back was a bit deeper so the Kindle feels more stable when propped up.  Otherwise, I'm very pleased.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I love EVERY song on the album.  Mumford and Sons are absolutely fantastic!!  I have listened to it every day since downloading it....
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The price was right and this cooler works as advertised. It has lowered my cpu temps by around 12-14 degrees under normal loads. The install was very straightforward, but I did have to cut my stock case to make it fit (it was wider than I expected). I would definitely buy one again.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Nice simple cover that does what it says.  Easy to install Kindle in cover and does not add additional bulk to holding the unit.
B000001ELP|4.0|so people moaned that this wasn't very kiss like. when i first got this the track listing was different (back in the 80's) i thought it was really very different but really good. sure this album isn't rock n' roll over or alive, but they'd already made those albums. the first half of the album is relatively mellow, but they are well written and recorded songs. the second half is not really very different from any other bunch of kiss songs. the now correct track listing tells a pretty good story and builds in intensity all the way through. i really like this album, and if it hadn't been a kiss album, many others would probably have liked it too. my fave tracks would be under the rose, the oath, i, a world without heroes and just a boy ... whatever, i think it's a really good listen on many levels
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|K. d. lang is the Mozart of our time. There is no one to compare her to and like Mozart she will be studied in colleges and universities throughout the world for many years to come.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|I cannot say enough about this show.<br />Probably one of the best every made.<br />The DVD's are great.<br />You can't go wrong with this set.
B009NOVCSS|4.0|I'm not going to say much about the 4 regular CD's on this set.  It's a career spanning set of 80 songs by the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the world.  What else is there to say?  There are a couple edited tracks, the previous reviews have it covered.<br /><br />The 5th CD and vinyl single were the highlights for me.  I am glad to finally have an offical release of the 5 1963 demos.  The BBC tracks on the vinyl single would have easily fit on the bonus disc with demos, so that's one issue and adding a few more demos and BBC tracks is another issue - there are certainly plenty more in the vaults.<br /><br />The book is pretty large, I think it could have been a more manageable size and a little more informative, but it's pretty nice.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Many times, losing someone we love reveals a chasm between the competent, caring, loving person we have assumed ourselves to be and the numb, disconnected scraps that are left behind once that relationship is gone. Cheryl Strayed's memoir of her journey on the Pacific Crest Trail helped me to understand my own process of putting the pieces back together and to let go of the guilt I have felt for all the (ultimately unhelpful) things I did to cope.

0399224459|5.0|Good Night Gorilla is the best... well tied for the best with &#34;Kiss Good Night&#34;.  Get both as board books.  I accidentally ordered the hard cover &#34;Gorilla&#34; and it does not work with infant fingers. I get both for all new babies.<br /><br />After that all children need &#34;The Incredible Book Eating Boy&#34; by Oliver Jeffers and the &#34;Dinosaur Counting Book&#34; with googly eyes.
B008XNZMOU|2.0|Taylor has a great voice, but this music is sappy soppy and even for her \\"We are never ever getting back to gether again\\" which is cute the CD is so not worth it.  It's just not lyrically interesting--it captures my attention zip except--yuck.<br />I resold it on Amazon the day after I bought it at Costco.  Unless you're mainstream follow all these young people the latest and greatest, this is not great music, and I don't know how it can be compared with Adele's 21 or \\"Rolling in the Deep\\".  Taylor obviously has big talent, but these songs, I hate them.  Yes pop, and not interesting pop.  Not country, and not crossover, and definitely not like Shania Twain one of the cross over artists she saw as models.  Shania had a big voice and music.  Taylors is just the same old same old ... sound (lyrics aside).  Every song sounds this same sound.  Buy if you're 14, skip it otherwise.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Listen to it all the time.  She's fantastic.  I wouldn't let young kids listen though as there is quite a bit of off language.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|incredible acting, heartwarming, and felt real. I was really surprised that I'd never heard of this movie before. And since it was free on prime, I assumed that it might not be the best movie. Wow, was I wrong. A+ acting, great script, all around entertaining and emotionally engaging movie.
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome book and an easy read! Great story line on top of great details! I am reading for the second time!

B00A12VW86|5.0|been a green day fan for 20 years - and they are still making awesome music. i've been reading a lot of reviews asking whether they are still &#34;punk&#34; or this and that. why do you have to classify it as anything? it's GREEN DAY! it's own category! they make unapologetic music for themselves and then it's up to fans to love it or not. and i do - i loved UNO and now i love DOS. i'm sure i will love TRE as well! can't wait!
1843794411|3.0|The reading and voices in the Audio CD version are done well, and the story was enjoyable.  It seemed, however, to be missing bits and pieces (e.g., incomplete character development, minor characters that seemed as though they'd have larger roles dropping out altogether), which wasn't consistent with my experience with the only other Heyer novel I'd read.  As I was replacing the CDs in the case, I checked the back cover and confirmed that the Audio CD version is, indeed, abridged--a fact which is missing from the product description and is only noted in one of the editorial reviews (which I don't generally read in detail).  While I'm sure the full novel is delightful, I'm only rating this at three stars due to the unadvertised abridged nature of this version.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|I loved Mad Men Seasons 1, 2, and 3, and I liked Season 4. While Season five started slowly, I was completely engrossed by the third or forth episode. Mad Men continues to surprise viewers with slick plot twists, complex and diverse characters, and period correct music and pop culture references. It is best to view the seasons in sequence, as many storylines and actions of the characters are recalled as the series progresses.<br />I would rate season 5 four and one half stars. It is slightly better than season 4 but not quite as strong as seasons 1-3. The five seasons collectively comprise what is certainly one of the best television shows I have ever seen. I own each of the seasons on DVD, and they are worth purchasing and demand repeated viewings.
159413586X|5.0|This was an interesting conclusion to the story line developed in The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.  In this third installment, it is somewhat hard to believe that Katniss is a 17 year old girl.  I did find myself sucked into the story almost immediately and found it hard to put down, so in that way the author did achieve her intent.  It was very easy to suspend belief while reading and go on this far fetched journey.  But in retrospect, it seems that whenever something doesn't make sense or defies explanation, they simply jump to another chapter.  For instance, Katniss is on fire in the middle of an intense battle and she is surrounded by dead people.  She is disguised as a resident of the Capital and no-one knows she is there.  Gale has been captured by peace keepers and dragged behind closed doors, presumably to his death.  Peeta is wandering around on the brink of a psychological breakdown.  End of chapter.  Sounds pretty grim for Katniss and Gale and Peeta.  New chapter.  Katniss and Peeta are in the hospital.  Gale has been treated and released.  How did they get there?  Who possibly would have found them and gotten them to safety amid the chaos?  It's too implausible to be believed, and so the book/storyline ignores an explanation.<br /><br />It will be very interesting to see how this is translated to the big screen.<br /><br />Good read, talented author, but not my favorite book of the series.
B0026JWDQW|5.0|I absolutely love this cd. I heard the song \\"Candy\\" in a dvd i'd rented, and had to find out who the artist was. Every song on this cd is great. If you haven't listened to \\"Pencil full of Lead\\" or \\"Candy\\" do yourself a favor, Paolo Nutini has a fantastic voice!!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Ever since some not-so-subtle hints were dropped in the movie \\"Ironman\\" when it came out a few years ago, we have been expecting \\"The Avengers\\" to come out for a while; it finally has. Despite all the intersecting plot lines from the different Marvel movies, Joss Whedon does an amazing job at working all of them into one coherent plotline, with the actors carrying it out marvelously. The special effects and script worked into the movie blend very well with the acting and the plot, and helps turn \\"The Avengers\\" into one of Joss Whedon's biggest blockbuster successes.<br /> The film begins with Samuel L. Jackson playing Nick Fury, the head of an organization called S.H.I.E.L.D., which is intent on defending Earth from otherworldly invaders. He establishes the plot arc by speaking of the Tesseract, an artifact of great power that could allow \\"unlimited energy for all mankind\\". Loki, of Asgard, has other plans with the device, however; most notably, plans of world domination. Tom Hiddleston, the actor who plays Loki, plays him expertly, and truly makes it seem that Loki is truly as single-minded and intent on domination as Joss Whedon intended. Tom also delivers his script stupendously, with a large egomaniacal flair suited to a supervillian such as Loki.<br /> As the film continues on, you meet the egotistical group of heroes that are the center and namesake of the movie; Thor, Ironman, Black Widow, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Hulk. While the entire cast of heroes gave great performances, Robert Downey Jr. as wise-cracking, self-centered, cynical Tony Stark and Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk truly make the movie immersive. Tony Stark/Ironman introduced some much-needed cynical humour throughout the movie, but also had some amazing character development, from the self-centered man at the beginning of the movie to the self-sacrificing man at the end. Mark Ruffalo also gave an amazing performance as Bruce Banner/The Hulk, and truly convinced the audience that he was a cursedman with a horrible inner daemon.<br /> Along with the stupendous acting provided by the cast, the special effects accompany the movie quite well. The fighting that occurs during the movie, the CGI style of the hostile army, and the energy effects of weapons and the Tesseract in particular are exquisite, and make the movie seem as realistic as possible with today's technology.<br /> The plot of The Avengers, while being somewhat cliché, is executed by Joss Whedon excellently, and easily makes up for the \\"Heroes vs. Villains\\" movie type. With the plot being intertwined with the different story arcs of the characters, and the overall execution of the movie being as good as it was, the plot was very immersive and engaging.<br /> Overall, The Avengers was an extremely good movie. With actors that play their parts exquisitely, special effects that keep giving, and a plotline that, while cliché, is executed gracefully by Joss Whedon, The Avengers gives its best through the entire movie, and its best is amazing. I would recommend this movie to anyone who knows the Marvel universe, or to anyone who is looking for a Friday night bash movie.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Absolutely amazing!  The greatest rock band of all time - and they bolster that title with this performance.  I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD since they first announced the concert back in 2007.  Best money I have ever spent - will enjoy this for years to come.  Everything about this DVD is amazing, the Blu Ray sound and picture quality is amazing.  Can't say enough good things about this DVD.  Must have for any Led Zeppelin fan!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I heard so much hype about the ending that I was on guard for the surprise.  But, like all his books, worth the time.
0393338827|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Ever. It is the best explanation I've read on the 2008 financial crisis. It reads like a suspenseful crime novel.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|It is interesting, when the same album is recorded twice; it's always the unreleased version that is perceived as the strongest & an over-sight by The Band/Record Company for making the wrong choice.<br />As is the case with \\"..Live from Hull\\" the sister of \\"Leeds\\", which has gained almost mythical status over the prevailing decades.<br />This is a great live album, but it's pretty similar to \\"Leeds\\", apart from songs like \\"A Quick one.\\" \\"Young Man Blues\\" & \\"My Generation\\", which are slightly different.<br />You've probably you've got \\"Leeds\\" & \\"Isle of White\\" already, so unless you're a massive Orrible Who fan, this isn't an essential purchase.<br />Still, a outstanding & innovative record, with a decent sound quality.<br />Although I'd be a bit miffed if I'd forked out all that money for the \\"Leeds\\" box then found out I could buy this for a Tenner!
B008OHV4PG|5.0|neil young at his best, great insight into his hometown. A must for any neil young fan.Will watch it over and over
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This book has a very literary quality. It moves across many generations with fascinating geographical and historical links. It made me want to find out more about my own family history and connections to major events of the last 150 years. Thoroughly enjoyable.
0399230033|3.0|I bought this book because of the reviews and I love all books that have to do with going to bed to read to my 15 month old son.  But this book has very little writing in it and is not appropriate for small kids.  I find myself adding in words to fill in the story (\\"and the gorilla takes the keys and says come along elephant...etc)  I love the illustrations but it isn't really what I thought it was going to be.  Don't buy this for anyone under 2 1/2 in my opinion.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What a great follow up to the first book!  The only part I dislike is having to wait for the third book in the series to become availale.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Movie was Awesome..... But then anything with Robert D.Jr..is Awesome.  I want to own all his movies.  And Sherlock Holmes is a good place to start.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn is my favorite author and this one does not disappoint. Mitch Rapp was off the charts in this read and some of the things he said were nicely timed and actually made me laugh out loud. Great humor woven into some nice new concepts, creative plot and twists.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Succinct insightful and efficient. Offers a great way of thinking for anyone interested in business. Very down to earth read.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Really enjoyed the book and thought it was one of his better reads. I would recommend it highly to Grisham fans.
1400067936|4.0|Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Fooled by Randomness is a treatise on the role of randomness in the financial industry and life in general. Taleb discusses humans' innately poor understanding of probability, presents common misconceptions, biases, and beliefs regarding this poor understanding, and elaborates on his highly rational methods of analysis, both in and outside the context of the financial industry. Taleb sometimes meanders off topic and occasionally comes off as pretentious or pedantic, but the concepts he presents in his book are always very well supported and, at the core, rational and uncompromised by variability.<br /> Fooled by Randomness is divided into three parts: a discussion of how asymmetry, skewness, and over-reliable on induction can cause one to be \\"fooled by randomness,\\" a summary of various biases those fooled by randomness have, particularly survivorship bias, and a final section on living with \\"randomitis,\\" embracing that you will inevitably be fooled by randomness. Taleb often relies on parables to illustrate examples of the ways people are fooled by randomness, both of ancient origin (such as Solon's warning or Odysseus and the sirens) and of his own construction (such as the story of Nero Tulip, a highly risk-averse trader, and his colleagues). Taleb sometimes pushes his intellectual nature onto his readers in a particularly pretentious form, name-dropping philosophers and narcissistically reminding his reader of how well-read he is. I felt that, at times, Taleb's style, while quite engaging, tends to obfuscate the points he is making.<br /> Despite this, Taleb's message is generally clear and valuable. Taleb's observations on the nature of randomness and its role in human performance are insightful and downright unsettling at times. His methodologies in analyzing \\"black swan events,\\" rare events that tend to have extremely significant unforeseen consequences, are sound and easily understandable. The author's descriptions of what makes a badtrader seems obvious, but his elaboration on the subject reveals several instances of probabilistic misconceptions and mistakes made in the financial industry that are, quite frankly, easy to make and shouldn't be so easily dismissed. The author even goes as far as to admit that he himself is quite capable of exhibiting common misconceptions in randomness, even on a subconscious level (as he demonstrates in one story about his own equivalent of a gambler's tick).<br /> Taleb also analyzes the possible shortcomings of many statistical approaches, calling into question the validity of inference-based models and the common mistake of assuming that inferences based on past trends will be accurate. Taleb's approach to this issue is interesting and philosophical, calling into view our lack of knowledge of \\"black swan events\\" until after they occur, and backing his assertions with historical evidence of this occurring. This section in particular highlights Taleb's sound, analytical nature that permeates the book, and highlights Taleb's lack of reserve when it comes to criticizing bad habits of the financial industry. This section is also notable in that it takes a more philosophical approach to questioning methodologies, a sharp contrast from his usual probabilistically based reasoning. This section shines the spotlight on the inherent shortcomings of mathematical induction through the black swan metaphor, in which he illustrates the idea of not being able to disprove a phenomena via induction through the example of observing 4000 white swans and attempting to conclude that no black swans exist. Taleb uses this to point out that, no matter how unlikely an event is, if it has any tangible chance of occurring, it must be considered in analysis, specially if its consequences are severe (as historical \\"black swan events\\" tended to be).<br /> Probably my favorite section of Fooled by Randomness is Taleb's approach to determining a person's true wealth. Defined in the context ofMonte Carlo simulation, Taleb establishes someone's true wealth as being equivalent to the estimated average wealth of the individual had he lived his life over again infinitely many times. In this way, Taleb offers a rational, mathematically-backed explanation as to why, for instance, a million dollars earned in a career in medicine is more valuable than a million dollars earned by winning the lottery. On a related note, this section of the book is summarized by a quote attributed to Solon, a greek legislator: \\"...to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future.\\" Or, to be put more succinctly: \\"It ain't over til' it's over.\\"<br /> However, as I've mentioned earlier, Taleb's writing style has a few flaws that may prevent you from enjoying his work. Firstly, Taleb tends to meander off topic, following a series of tangents to a point that ultimately distracts from his main messages. For instance, I felt that his analysis of randomness in the humanities, namely poetry and music, was unnecessarily long. While Taleb has the habit of going off topic, his diversions are typically, nevertheless, interesting and harmless. However, the author's more serious flaw is that his writing style is inherently narcissistic and exposes his large ego at several points. This is an issue that may or may not affect your enjoyment of Fooled by Randomness. I, for one, was not very bothered by this style and was still able to appreciate the message of the book, but several of my peers understandably did not care at all for Taleb's writing and found the book unreadable. I feel at times that it's Taleb's nature to go against the grain on virtually every issue. While it is a strategy that tends to make him a good profit in the financial world, it is also a trait that serves to polarize his readers.<br /> Personally, I would recommend this book to anyone involved or interested in the financial industry, and also in related disciplines such as economics, mathematics, and the hard sciences. Taleb's analytical nature makes Fooled by Randomness a excellent read that is bound to change your perspective on just how much randomness can affect your life, both in and out of the world of finance.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I have not felt as deeply connected to any book since the first time I read The Never-Ending Story, by Michael Ende. The Night Circus is a fantastic read, in every sense of the word. The characters are engaging, the setting enchanting... It left me wishing that I might one day be able to attend Le Cirque des Rêves, though I cannot help but doubt that possibility.

B008VBYN80|5.0|i am speechless about this game my brother has it and he loves it too so i love it and loveit
0810994739|5.0|These books are a bit like a comic, a bit like a young novel. My son was very motivated to read them, and he really never enjoyed reading on his own prior to this. He is in second grade, reading at grade level. His younger brother also enjoys them. I would encourage any parent to give them a try.
0385535147|3.0|This was disappointing to me.  I listened to the recorded (abridged) version for a trip and maybe it would be better in book form.  Hard to say.<br /><br />But for the recorded version, there were so many characters and switches back and forth that it was hard to follow.<br /><br />Also, I found it hard to get \\"into\\" because none of the characters are really very good people.  The main character (Malcolm/Max) starts by saying how much he misses his son while in prison for money laundering.  But, given the chance to rat out someone else, he is able to not only get out of prison, but he orchestrates stealing stolen money.  Hard to really root for someone who is just less bad than the other crooks.<br /><br />He zips into the Witness Protection program without a backward thought to his son.  I kept waiting for him to at least be interested in/want to see/want to speak with his son.  Never happened.  Never mentioned.<br /><br />Again, in written form it might be better, but the story in the recorded version was FAR too convoluted and complicated.  It was exhausting.  Disappointing, because I've really enjoyed most Grisham novels.

1451638450|4.0|Lois McMaster Bujold's newest entry in the VORKOSIGAN SAGA, Captain Vorpatril's Alliance, is a romp from start to finish. It's not great literature, but it's a great deal of fun, and I enjoyed every minute reading it.<br /><br />Bujold appears to have exhausted the possibilities in Miles Vorkosigan's life, now that he is as highly placed a government official as he can be, as well as happily married and the father of at least two children. So Bujold has turned to a minor character in Miles's story, his cousin, Ivan Vorpatril.<br /><br />Ivan is a captain in the Barrayar military, working in Ops as the staff officer to Admiral Desplains. He and the Admiral are presently stationed on the planet Komarr, which is pleasant enough duty. Ivan sees his job as sorting snakes that come over the Admiral's desk, forwarding the highly poisonous and dangerous snakes on to his boss, wrestling the less dangerous but still unwieldy snakes himself, and sending the garden snakes on to those of lesser rank to deal with as appropriate. He may call them snakes, but they're really problems, and he is what we would today call a paper-pusher. His job doesn't involve any more danger than the displeasure of a fellow military officer, at least in this time of peace in the Imperium. Or at least that's the case right now, when he and Miles are on different planets; Miles has caused him plenty of problems in the past.<br /><br />But even if Miles isn't around, Ivan's disreputable friend, Byerly Vorrutyer is. Actually, By isn't all that disreputable, though he attempts to appear so; he is really a member of Imperial Security, known as ImpSec. That is, he's a spy. He's got a problem he needs some help with: he wants to deputize Ivan to go pick up a girl. By thinks she's using a false identity, and she has attracted some unhealthy attention. By would like Ivan to find out who she is and what she wants, not to mention why she's working as a packing clerk at Swift Shipping. Ivan is less than enthusiastic, but he makes the attempt, only to find that the object of his attentions is far from helpless.<br /><br />In fact, Tej and her companion, a beauty with blue and gold skin, manage to turn the tables on Ivan quite nicely. But before they can finish what they've started, that unhealthy attention shows up at the window; and beyond that, the police show up at the door. Ivan comes up with an interesting suggestion to solve all the problems at once, and the race is on.<br /><br />It would be unfair to say anything more about the plot, as this novel is packs in one surprise after another. Don't look here for elegant characterization (though the characters are convincing) or gorgeous language. Bujold is telling a story, one full of events and switchbacks and intrigue. It's a ripping yarn, as they used to say, and it serves the purpose of keeping the reader soundly entertained.<br /><br />It helps to know something about the history of the Imperium, but it isn't required; Bujold fills in sufficient backstory to keep any reader up to speed. Still, despite its accessibility this would not be the best place to begin reading the VORKOSIGAN SAGA, which is still really about Miles Vorkosigan, not Ivan Vorpatril. I recommend starting with the omnibus edition Young Miles to get a flavor for the series. But once you've read one, you're likely to want to read them all, and Captain Vorpatril's Alliance is a fine addition to the series.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The biggest beef I have with \\"Brave\\" is the title and how it relates to character development. When, exactly, was Merida brave? She was foolish and got herself into trouble, and then panicked about how to fix it. I had expected more heroism on her part. Something equivalent to selflessly running into a burning building. It just never happened. She ended up crying and - ta da! - wouldn't you know it, that... somehow... solved it. Huh. I just don't buy into the \\"strong female lead\\" thing with Merida.<br /><br />This movie was not what I expected at all. The main \\"twist\\" in the plot took it down 10 notches from \\"Oh, this could be really interesting!\\" to \\"...oh, I really am watching a kid's movie, aren't I.\\" Another case of a misleading trailer sucking me in.<br /><br />For basic entertainment, it's OK. But, I strongly believe it was over hyped and mis-marketed just to get our ticket money. I left the theater feeling unsatisfied.<br /><br />All in all, I think the movie tried to do too much at once, lost its focus, and ought to have returned to the drawing board.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Sometimes I walk into a movie with high hopes and I'm profoundly disappointed (Green Lantern) and sometimes I walk into movies with low expectations and am pleasantly surprised (X-Men: First Class), but every so often, I walk into a movie knowing exactly what to expect and the film delivers exactly that. Prometheus is one of those movies, but not in a good way. As a Ridley Scott fan, I expected this movie to have stunning visuals and in that, the film does not disappoint. The man is clearly a visual storyteller and all of his films (whether they be his duds or his best work) are always visually compelling. As an Alien franchise fan, I expected any continuation of the series (whether it's the original series, the AvP films or this tangent of a film) to subscribe to the law of diminishing returns and in that, this film meets that expectation fully. As a person who's learned to become wary of any project Damon Lindelof is involved in, this movie certainly proves its point as to why it's wise to check the fine print in the credits...<br /><br />It's easy to find faults with the film (as several reviewers have already pointed out), but I feel like the most disappointing aspect of the film is that it portends to be a return to a classic sci-fi film that explores the bigger mysteries of life cocooned inside a thrilling space adventure. However, the film ultimately resigns itself to bringing up larger concepts and then never really exploring them. This is a film content to revel in quasi-philosophical wonderings without any real sort of point of view and, once again, we plumb the depths of the basic gist of Chariots of the Gods? without adding anything even remotely new to the concept (which is even sadder when you realize that they've even already explored this concept in the colossally dumb first AvP movie.) This is a movie trying very hard to be serious, but ending up as hokey as any other sci-fi film that takes itself way too seriously. As a result, this is a film thathas style to spare, but barely any substance to speak of.<br /><br />On this, I would point the finger at Lindelof. He did the same thing with the TV series Lost (bringing up questions without any answers and then casually trying to cop out by claiming the questions are bigger than the answers) and this is a 2-hour film version of that screenwriting conundrum with a lot of visual flair and an unsatisfying reason to exist. I didn't find the characters to be especially fleshed-out and I found the main plot points to be a little ham-handed. Some elements of the script feel like they were written by first-year philosophy students and other elements are simply winking at the Alien franchise. Ultimately, there's only one thing I found interesting in this movie and it's something that isn't even addressed in this film, but seems to be held over for a sequel (SPOILER ALERT - I thought it would be interesting to follow Noomi Rapace's character to the Engineer homeworld, but it looks like that won't happen until a sequel.) To me, it seems like this movie wants to be so much more than it is and it's frustrating to watch it struggle at the seams.<br /><br />Of course, many reviewers have already pointed out the nonsensical antics of most of the characters: Yes, several characters in this movie do not make sense - whether doing things that do not make sense, existing for no apparent reason or vaguely being an archetype for a whole host of sci-fi cliches (never trust a robot... unless it's R2-D2... because he'll save your ass every time you do something idiotic.) A large number of these characters' motivations seem unbelievable, a few characters are incredibly unlikable, but most are played by actors and actresses you like in other things. I like Michael Fassbender, I like Charlize Theron, I like Idris Elba and I even like Noomi Rapace, but most of these talents are seriously wasted. Seriously, Idris Elba is more interesting in Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and have you seen that film? That film's a wreck, but at least he's entertaining in it. Here... well, he's in it, but that's about all I can say. Same thing for Charlize Theron - you keep waiting for her character to pay off eventually, but it never does, so it begs the question: why is the character there? Some of the other characters are pointless, too, but you know that they're alien fodder, so they don't really matter. It's a shame that most of the main cast don't really matter either.<br /><br />Like people who are fans of this film, I was fascinated by the Engineers themselves and wanted to know more about them, but the film isn't interested in exploring them for any length of time and, from what information we do get of them, they're mostly a parallel to humans themselves in other entries of this series (in that they fool around with things they couldn't possibly hope to understand and usually destroy themselves doing it.) Maybe this is the central conceit of the film: we're the Engineers, the Engineers are us... man, that's boring. It's one of the oldest chestnuts in the bag of sci-fi cliche - make up an alien race that's pretty much a mirror image of us and point out the irony in the dumb things that we do. I get it. It's been done. It's been done a lot. It gets old after awhile, but not as old as these other cliche chestnuts that Prometheus explores: 1.) Humans are so dumb, they couldn't have possibly evolved without the help of alien interference; 2.) Although they helped to create us, we will never really be on the same level as our alien benefactors, so whenever we try to reach towards the heavens, they will destroy us...; 3.) ...which is kind of a religious allegory that calls into question the very nature of faith itself. Are we all part of some sort of divine plan (alien or otherwise) or are we just fooling ourselves into thinking that we're more than the sum of our parts? These are heavy concepts, to be sure, but like I've said previously, they're concepts the film delights in bringing up, but never fully exploring (in fact, it reminds me slightly of Star Trek V, which tried to explore similar territory, but then suddenly remembered it was a Star Trek movie halfway through and threw in a bunch of Klingons and an alien pretending to be God to skirt around the issue.)<br /><br />The bottom line is this: the Alien films seem to work best when they're either a straight-up horror-type film like the original Alien or a balls-to-the-wall action film like Aliens. Whenever it strays too far from either of these genres, it seems to fall flat and be mediocre at best. Prometheus might work better if it were removed from the Alien franchise and stood alone as its own work (which is something the film seems like it wants to do, but knows it'll gain an audience if you relate it to something audiences already liked, which really just results in a film without a coherent identity.) At the end of the day, it's more enjoyable than some of the entries into the franchise, but it won't be one that you'll necessarily return to as often (for me, I'm always down for watching Alien and Aliens, I'll reluctantly watch Alien 3 and pass over Alien: Resurrection without comment. AvP is its own thing and I don't know that I can ever fully integrate it into the Alien franchise as a whole.) Prometheus is a movie that I might get talked into watching again solely because the visuals are so stunning, so even though I don't care much for what is happening on screen, it sure looks beautiful. As for the casual viewer, I can only recommend it if you go in with the right amount of expectations. If you aren't expecting much, you will find it watchable. If you're expecting a lot, forget it, because you won't find it here.<br /><br />It's interesting to note that in Greek mythology, Prometheus played a trick on Zeus, offering up two different sacrifices: one was a selection of beef hidden inside an ox's stomach (nourishment hidden inside a displeasing exterior), and the bull's bones wrapped completely in \\"glistening fat\\" (something inedible hidden inside a pleasing exterior). Zeus chose the latter and, like this movie, that's what we, as audiences, got: something inedible hidden inside a pleasing exterior...

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Way to much sex. Got so it was same ole same ole. I liked the story line but felt it was unfinished at the end. Made me feel as if I was reading a book that was copied off of other books. The author got lazy. The reason most people read these books was the excitment of the sex. Once that was said and done, you would know what was coming up.
B004I1K2NW|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I wanted to see it in theaters but I was only 14 at the time and couldn't convince my stepmom to take me. Ever since seeing it on VHS, I've loved the movie. The visual effects and humor (the exception of Judge humping a mummy) are great. The finale drags on a bit, but I love everything else about the movie. The great cinematography and music by Danny Elfman (and the fantastic sound design I discovered on DVD) all make for a great ride.
B008G12ERC|4.0|Really digging this band right now. They've been on a roll for the past 3 releases and while I don't grok this one QUITE as much as the previous album, it's excellent!
B009YU62H2|4.0|The patented disjointed, fragmented, almost progressive at times Soundgarden sound is back. That's a good thing! It's not as easily accessible as your ordinary straightforward Audioslave song...and hopefully the casual listener will take the time to give it that crucial 3rd or 4th spin that it takes to really catch. Kim recently said himself that Audioslave was like a more linear Soundgarden. So while this will not appeal to the mainstream as much, it wasn't neccessarily meant to. It was meant for the fans who have been clamoring so long for a Soundgarden reunion. Soundgarden in their prime is another story, but this is a good album on its own merits and thats all that I am judging it by here<br /><br />And as a Chris Cornell fan it's been a bit of a rocky road. I loved the solo stuff especially Euphoria Morning. Carry On was decent to good but a little slow and the harder rocking songs that were there, missed. But I hated Scream and am a little bitter. I bought it, I tried to have an open mind, but it was just not my thing. I also realize that if Chris hadn't gone on to make Scream and alienate his fanbase to a certain extent, this Soundgarden reunion never would have happened. So I wasn't fooled at all, and not all that suprised when the reunion was announced initially. Chris needs to reconnect with his fan base, and I definitely appreciate that. I understand that he needed to branch out, and had to at least try to fulfill some of his lifelong Macartney-esque dreams. He just needs to realize that he has already done that for most of us, and that he doesn't need the mainstream courting and affection to be a personal success (and I'm sure he realizes this to some level)<br /><br />So I guess you get it now, I'm a big Chris Cornell fan. But I also want to go out of my way a bit more here, because I believe the first Audioslave album is one of the best albums in the last 20 years. Their work is and was underappreciated, partly because of the short tenure, and also because their last album fizzled. I also want to go against the grain a bit and say that I loved the new Soundgarden song Live to Rise, from the Avengers soundtrack. Some fans were saying it sounded too mainstream and not \\"Soundgarden\\" enough. I don't know if that figured in to this album any, but most of the songs here will appeal less to the mainstream than that song did. But I loved it, and it showed that they can still write a hit song (when they want to). Maybe there will be more of them sometime after this album where their fanbase (going into the first new album in 16 years) was a little over-paranoid about them recapturing a certain formula<br /><br />I'm going to give this album 4 stars. For what it is, it's amazing! A reunion album, so many years later, where they do indeed successfully recapture their sound. It is indeed amazing that they even pulled it off at all. I actually think I'll grow to like this album more after I completely learn the lyrics and how to sing it. But in conclustion, King Animal is a beast, pun intended. All of the songs are good, a couple are great, and some try to be. Halfway There does sound like it could have come from Carry On, but with a legendary backing band lol! It's a good song despite what some may say, and the lyrics deeply connected with me on a personal level. Bones of Birds has to be the highlight of the album, along with Taree which is sick!<br /><br />Songs in order of most favorite to least so far: Bones of Birds, Taree, Non State Actor, A Thousand Days Before, Been Away Too Long, By Crooked Steps, Attrition, Worse Dreams, Halfway There, Eyelid's Mouth, Black Saturday, Rowing, and Blood on the Valley Floor
B0041KVW2K|4.0|As a long time Beatles fan who has a few original UK presses, original US presses and a bunch of various reissues, I will keep it short and to the point.  Digital source or not, these are some of the best sounding Beatles LP's out there.  At times they may sound a tad different to what you may be used to because each instrument and voice are so clear that at times I felt like they were recording in my living room, but what strikes me the most about these releases is the low end.  The bass sounds fantastic on these releases!<br /><br />It must be noted that indeed there are a lot of terrible defects out there in circulation, I had to return a few copies over and over before I got nice clean and perfect copies.  Admittedly, it is a bit of crapshoot regarding what you will get.  Some of the copies I bought were warped, had major tracking errors and were riddled with more popping and crackling than a bowl of rice crispies! However, if you persist in returning the junk you receive you will eventually find Beatle bliss with clean, quiet beautifully mixed copies.  Perfect copies are out there and these are the best Beatle LP's you will ever find for under 50 bucks a pop, so don't give up and don't settle.

B0031RAOVY|1.0|worst movie i ever seen.boring and bad actino and did not like the actors and the color was bad and it was to long.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|These utensils are FABULOUS!  The little stand which keeps the \\"food end\\" of the utensil from sitting on the counter or stove makes clean-up a breeze.  The utensils are wonderful to use despite their shape and style.  The only slightly down is the rainbow of colors.  Unfortunately they don't match anything in my kitchen, but their usefulness and durability more than makes up for that.
B005LAII08|3.0|All in all, I wasn't really enthralled with this movie one way or the other: hence the down the middle rating.  The animation was good, but to some degree, these movies are starting to get a little out there for kids.<br /><br />The witch for example, is not the \\"friendliest\\" character in the movie.  While Pixar tries to make a witch not scary and frightening, I believe she still comes across as such.  The bears attacking each other and the cursed bear can provide a few scary moments.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, I was tired of the overdone accents of the characters.  It was cute at first, but 93 minutes of hard to understand scottish accents was a little too much for me.<br /><br />Glad we rented it and didn't buy it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Though some might say that Grisham writes formula fiction, I don't care because he is so inventive and skillful that every book is a delight to curl up with.<br /><br />Racketeer is no exception.<br /><br />If you want a good page turner to carry you away, go no further.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Wow!  This book... gah.  I had so many emotions reading this book.  You think \\"what horrible circumstances these kids have to deal with\\"... but really, this book is about choosing to live with the cards you are dealt in life.  Lake & Will share have so many things in common.  Even though they had to endure trial after trial... they remained strong and true to each other.  There is no way they were going to ever relate to anyone else.  They were truly meant to be...true love.  There were times I thought they wouldn't make it... times I cried for them.... times that I wanted to scream at Will for doing the things he did.  But it worked and made for one VERY good book!  Highly recommend this & the sequel Point of Retreat.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The title is a bit misleading, but the author's experience and his consequent paradigm shift regarding the role of consciousness in the universe (and it's non-locality) is delicious.<br /><br />I certainly applaud Dr. Alexander for having the courage and the will to stand in the face of the scientism that insists that consciousness is an artifact of brain function.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

Not faint praise for a book where you are constantly expecting the characters to blurt out lines such as \\"This is unbelievably awesome...\\" (and sometimes, they actually do deliver them).

I don`t know what`s going on with Ms.Cornwell,but her last few books have been very subpar. And that`s coming from an avid fan. I was beyond dissapointed with this book. I suggest before buying it,read it at the library first. I ended up skipping entire paragraphs and skimming pages because she just went on and on about stuff that wasn`t really that important to the story. Nearly 3 chapters about the history of the leatherback turtle alone. I wasn`t sure if I had the right book if it didn`t come with a cover!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />As I was born in 1960, & my father was a huge fan of James Bond, both the books & films. James Bond is amongst my earliest memories of movies. I grew up loving & idolizing 007. As a young boy, who would not want to be the man to win all the battles & save the world? As a teenager, who would not want to be the man who got all the girls? Yes, James Bond was the man, no doubt about it. Sean Connery's (the best Bond) smooth & suave demeanor, was the definition of virility & sophistication that just about every man wished he could be. George Lazenby's physical approach to Bond, & apt portrayal was promissing, but faced the insurmountable task in following Connery. He was given maybe the best Bond film ever made (certainly if Connery was Bond), but was highly maligned. One has to wonder how he would of molded the role had he choose to play Bond more than once? Roger Moore's tongue in cheek portrayal of Bond, which later turned more into him sticking his tongue out at the audience, while he blatantly winked away. Timothy Dalton's quietly sincere interpretation of 007, which I thought was a very good Bond, but maybe to sincere after Moore's bastardization of his later Bond films. Pierce Bronson, the man who I felt never quite fit in the role, then given later films that would further 007's downhill surmise.<br /><br />Then there is Danial Craig! Not since Sean Connery has there been a Bond so all commanding of his screen presence, & hence, the silver screen it's self. Craig, who looked at first glance to be an unlikely & unwise choice for Bond, after the succession of pretty boys with their pretty gadgets, as the superspy. Danial Craig who made Bond believable again, through pure physical charisma & an acting ability far above any other Bond since Connery, in fact, he rivals Connery in many ways. Craig whose tough as steel persona & physique, yet a vulnerability underlying his commanding presence. A Bond driven by past torments, who only lets you see glimpses of his core nature. The coldest killing machine of a Bond that ever was, but yet a warmth inhabits his performance.<br /><br />If there was a doubt that anything I just wrote about Daniel Craig is true, it surely has been put to rest & cemented by his latest film \\"Skyfall.\\" The most intimately personal look at James Bond ever given a houseful of Bond lovers at the theater, with possibly the exception of the last 10 minutes of \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\\" Here Bond is stripped naked of all his armor, to show us a man who has been tormented all his life in one form or another. Here is Bond, a man unsure of himself, looking for resurrection & redemption, & here he finds it all in one film, \\"Skyfall.\\"<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" is certainly one of the greatest Bond films ever, it has all the action & intrigue of the best Bond. Yet, one can not compare it to other great Bond films such as \\"From Russia With Love,\\" \\"Goldfinger,\\" \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service,\\" & Craig's own superb, \\"Casino Royal.\\" For it is a different breed of Bond, letting us inside his secretive world. Even it's villain \\"Silva,\\" Javier Bardem's (\\"No Country for Old Men\\") tremendously maniacal performance as a man driven by psychotic revenge, is another door unlocked to the secret world of the 00's. His villain certainly is the most complex of any Bond film. His acting unquestionably the greatest of anyone to play a Bond villain. Even Telly Savalas as \\"Blofeld, & Gret Frobe as \\"Goldfinger,\\" fall to Javier's, \\"Silva.\\" Finally, Judi Dench's \\"M,\\" is the third door that opens in this most revealing of all Bond films. Her tough as nails persona gets deconstructed brick by brick, board by board. She mirrors the self crisis that Bond is experiencing, am I all that I was, or seem to be? Can I overcome all that I fear?<br /><br />So here it is, a film like no other Bond film ever made. A film of self doubt. A film of self reliance. A film of determination to overcome any obstacle in one's way. At once an intimate film, but that is huge in it's execution, drive, suspense, & thrills. A film with a few surprises not mentioned here, & lastly, a film that will secure Daniel Craig's place as a great Bond, & the making of more Bond films in the foreseeable future!y. At once an intimate film, but that is huge in it's execution, drive, suspense, & thrills.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After book 2 was a dud for me until the final chapter ended in a cliff hanger....I hurriedly bought the Mocking jay. Well it didn't disappoint. Though there were lapses in this book it didn't lag like its predecessor. I felt as if I was there when Boughs handed over command to Katniss, Ms. Collins imagery was alive. Though it holds no candle to the first book I am sure everyone would enjoy reading of the fate of the girl who was on fire.
1118232658|5.0|Erik Qualman, who literally wrote the book on Social Media, just did it again. The Revised Socialnomics is totally up date and has it all, as we would only expect from Erik, a leading pioneer in the field. His video from the first Socialnoics continues to be shown to college marketing majors across the country. The new Socialnomics is loaded with practical advice and great examples from well known brands. Highly recommended.

B0076XIS4O|5.0|Visions is easily my best of the year. I have listened to this record on repeat over and over. I try to branch out to other records and end up coming back to this... in fact it's still playing as I type this.<br /><br />At the risk of doing that thing where reviewers talk way too much about themselves, I'm a musician. I tend to go through phases where one individual in particular inspires me to create. I looked up to Geoff Barrow, Claudio Sanchez and Tim Kasher, and though I never thought of Bjork or Imogen Heap as heroes, the soundscapers behind their music--Marius de Vries and Guy Sigsworth--were definitely inspirations as I started going more electronic. But Claire Boucher is my first female musical hero, and she wallops all of 'em. I read that she described this album as being 'handed down to her from God'. Some of the tracks are probably less holy than others, but songs like Genesis and Symphonia just move you spiritually, and Nightmusic was such a grower that it's now my number two pick on the record. Five stars. If you can deal with not knowing what the heck she's saying at any given point, this will be one of your favorite records or I'll eat my hat.
B008BM9L72|1.0|Thats all I can say I won't b reading the rest I think you have to be pretty sick to put that on paper and it's just wrong. I mean who does the ridiculous things just because he is so handsome? The book is too repetitive and the guy character needs serious therapy. The heroine stupid stupid stupid! I cannot believe people like this book or wants a man as sick and twisted as this when did people take a wonderful and beautiful things as lovemaking and turned it into something so crude and sadistic this book should be banned
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Interesting style, fascinating characters . . . it's hard to believe that you can come to know the idiosyncracies of each character from just the letters in which they are briefly described.  And they're all really wonderful, colorful characters.<br /><br />Just read it, you'll love it!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Campy look at what sometimes happens to older people when the chips are down. The Indian backdrop make for some interesting cinematography.
