6304057709|5.0|I didn't know anything about Jane Austen when I first watched this film.  Maybe I still don't know that much.  But after watching Sense &amp; Sensibility I thought this was the best film about true love I had ever seen.  (A special congratulation must go to Patrick Doyle's exquisite musical score - simply beautiful.)
B00000FCBC|4.0|this cd has lots of quality songs on it even has to different moods on it Disc 1 has more slower and moody pace to the songs except for a few. And the second is all full of thrash metal that metallica is know and loved for this cd is awesome and it would have gotten five stars except for the fact that i don't believe in giving cover cds five stars because they are not original but i still believe this cd is a creat buy
B000002U82|5.0|This album completely blows me away every time I listen to it.  The whole thing is so flowing that it takes me away to my own parrellel universe as all thoughts that were in my mind are instantly cleared to make my head an orb of pure nothingness.  Pink Floyd are insane geniuses.  This is by far the best Floyd album out there and if you don't have it get it!  My friend got me started listening to Floyd and now I thank Him for getting me started.  Any real Floyd fan knows what i am talking about.  This album is a complete masterpeice.  I salute you members of the group of musical stylists; Your name is Pink Floyd!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack once again has proved to their loyal fans, they really know how to make music. \\"Faceless\\" is their new and impressive album. <BR>It contains 12 songs.<BR>\\"Straight put of line\\" is the opening song which has amazing heavy riffs, so \\"Changes\\" which is similar but the vocals in it are awesome.<BR>\\"Make me believe\\" It has a cool background but the chorus is greater than the background.<BR>\\"I stand alone\\" is the theme from Scorpion King .Its very good.<BR>\\"Re-align\\" Its actually one of the best songs of the album. It has excelent lyrics fused with amazing riffs.<BR>\\"I f***** hate you\\" its the classical (excelent) Godsmack style.<BR>\\"Releasing the Demons\\" is \\"Awake\\" rebirth .<BR>\\"Faceless\\" is some sort of recompilation of some godsmack song styles in one. Its great.<BR>\\"Dead and broken\\" is OK<BR>\\"I am\\" its the best track of the album. The backgroun is amazing, vocals are better than ever and lyrics are #$%&/\\"#$%.<BR>\\"The awakening\\" is just an intro incluidin a lot of instrument and some chants.<BR>\\"Serenity\\" is a new version of Vodoo except this song is better than Voodoo itself.<br />Conclusion- \\"faceless\\" is a most-buy-album it wont dissapoint you.
B00005JLR2|4.0|I approached this movie with low expectations, having read the generally poor reviews, and noting the weak performance at the box officer, but I must admit that I was plesantly surprised by this movie. The animation is very good, although I wish Disney would move on to Pixar and Dreamworks computer animation, the voice talent is superb, and the story is fun. I recommend Treasure Planet to anyone who enjoys this kind of movie.
B000092ZYX|4.0|After the success of their fairly experimental work, Amnesiac and Kid A, Radiohead releases their 6th studio album, Hail to the Thief.  While the title implies that this is a political album, the content explores a wider variety of topics.  Thom Yorke's falsetto is not as prominent on this album as it was on OK Computer and The Bends, yet his vocals fit the music and his lyrics are as brilliant as ever.<br />Sometimes you can't attempt to infer metaphors from every lyric.  Thom Yorke uses many words on this album because he thinks the way they sound fits the song, he's always right too.  Myxomatosis, the lethal disease found in rabbits, has no real meaning in the song by the same title.  The same is true when on \\"Sit down. Stand up,\\" Thom says \\"the raindrops\\" around 46 times.  The song itself is spectacular, a haunting electronic piece with a fast paced, genius ending.  \\"2+2=5\\" and \\"Go to Sleep.\\" will be enjoyed most by the Radiohead fans that couldn't quite get their head around the electronics of Kid A and Amnesiac.<br />The first single, \\"There there,\\" really captures the essence of the whole album.  Some electronics, but more melodic than Kid A.  This album truly does bridge the gap between OK Computer and Kid A and Amnesiac.<br />There isn't a dissapointing song on the album (there really can't be with Radiohead), but some other stand-out tracks are \\"A Wolf at the Door,\\" \\"Scatterbrain,\\" and \\"Backdrifts.\\"<br />I would definately put this on your \\"must have\\" list.
B000089RVX|4.0|This is quite an interesting proposal for a 2003 for a debut album. On it you'll find a rough and powerful guitar sound combined with well achieved keyboard and choral arrangements plus introspective lyrics; all wrapped up with beautiful female vocals. The result is a record with quite a unique sound: dark and heavy but harmonic and beautiful at the same time. It's true that the CD could have been much better, but it's really difficult to find a band of young kids willing to do something musically different, mature and significant; that alone is remarkable. If you like well done rock music then \\"Fallen\\" is a must have.
B00003CXI0|4.0|I thought that this movie did a great job bringing the novel to life. Actually seeing Diagon Alley and Hogwarts was great! However, as I have found in the past, books are almost always better than the movie, and this is no exception. Although the movie was great...the book was so much better. There are just so many more intricate details in the book that you just don't get in the movie...hence the 4 stars.  All together a great movie, and a must see for any Harry Potter fan!
B000092ZYX|4.0|I have to admit, when I first heard the album, I was less then impressed. I was expecting something completely spectacular for this long anticipated album. But yet again, Radiohead never seizes to suprise me. So, I gave it a shot, being that this is my favorite band of all time. And so it happened again, as with the last two albums proceeding: The more and more I listened to the astonishingly unique sound of radiohead intertwined with the pure emotion-filled drones of Thom Yorke, the more I realized what it was all about. It wasn't the band trying hard to be different. It wasn't them trying to be what they were before. It was just the band being what they are, Radiohead. So, the witty repartee and the hidden conotations got me again, as it always does. and I love this album now more then I thought I ever could at first listen. <BR>So, my advise to you is: listen to this album as much as you would any other album (and if you are a huge Radiohead fan as I am, never stop listening to it) because you will find that the true essense of the album will one day slap you in the face as hard as the tongue in check lyrics do.
B000068IEU|4.0|This 1972 production is one of the first films to present violence in the context of American society, and not in castles or anything. Wes Craven, who is recognized with his 'Scream' triology by masses, does a fine job in his debut.<br />The movie's plot is as follows: A bunch of guys and a girl, think that they need more girls to their group for the sake of equalizing the number of girls and guys in the group, and of course having a little fun. We see two girls, who're to see a concert in a bad neighborhood. They want to have some 'grass', and ask someone in the street to have 'a cut'. He calls them to their house, and viola! They're trapped. It will be the next couple of violent hours where we see the girls being brutally harrassed, raped, and killed out in the woods. <br />What makes the story more interesting is that it all happens in the walking distance of Mari's - one of the killed girls - house. The group changes clothes and knock on the family's door. In fact, they will be welcomed very well. However, things will change as the parents discover what they've done.<br />The acting is not perfect; I must admit that. The soundtrack isn't either. In a lot of the violent moments, the music director chooses to put country folk music, which just doesn't make any sense. Had they put some real scary music, the effect would have been much more intensifying. However, 'Last House on the Left' is overall a successful production, which should be watched to see where we were before and where we are now in scary movies. In fact, I like the old movies.
B00003CXB2|5.0|It is unsurprising to me that some people find Lawrence of Arabia boring.  If you have the attention span of a hummingbird, this is not a film you will enjoy.  It has no car chases, no bikini-clad supermodels, and nary a kung-fu move to be seen.  Instead, all it offers is tortured respect for everything it touches.  Lawrence of Arabia is a film that elevated the art of cinematic storytelling to new heights, and it shows.  It is the journey, not the destination, that the viewer should focus on.  In order to enjoy this film, you must make a commitment to watch it.  Get comfortable, have something to drink on hand (you'll know why about halfway through), turn off the phone, and put the remote under a pillow.  I've seen a lot of films, and some I've liked to varying degrees, and others I've simply been satisfied that Hollywood didn't butcher the underlying work or premise too badly in pursuit of the lowest common denominator.  Lawrence of Arabia is different.  It is one of those truly rare films that makes you feel grateful for having seen it, for the efforts of all those involved to craft, create, and perserve over the years just so you might have the chance to see it.  It is such a fine film that its merits are obvious, and negative statements about it tend to simply reflect back on the critic.<br />Why?  Many reasons.  The actors are likewise gifted with rare talent, and superbly cast.  The settings and scenes are invariably breathtaking.  The plot is engrossing and entertaining without ever becoming heavy-handed.  Film students will while away hours discussing everything from the Christ imagery to the undercurrents of homoeroticism, but they do that with every film.  I suggest you simply kick back and enjoy an excellent, time-honored epic about a stranger in a strange land.  It is a harrowing, draining journey, but one you will not regret.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This is one of my favorite cds!!  Who knew that these people could sing like this??   From beginning to end this cd makes me want to get up and dance and belt out the tune!  Everyone does an amazing job, but Catherine Zeta-Jones takes the cake! She has the perfect sultry voice to pull off these songs (especially &quot;All That Jazz&quot; and &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot;) <br />This cd just gets me pumped up and i just love it!  And as if that wasn't good enough, to bring it up-to-date, they added an all new rap version of &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot;. Although it doesn't really relate to the rest of the cd (sound wise) it's a nice added bonus!  I have recommended this cd to all of my friends, and will continue to tell people about it!
B00008K7AM|5.0|This is a way funny movie but sort of reminded me of Freaky Friday. My kids laughed there bums off. It was just a fun wacky movie.
B000092ZYX|5.0|To say anything less than saying this is one of if not Radiohead's best album is an understatement. From a personal standpoint, I LOVED &quot;OK Computer&quot; and look to it as the definitive Radiohead CD...Until now! This CD combines all the aspects that make Radiohead such a great band. Thom's haunting vocals on this album combined with the writing that can be found here are a winning combination. More writing and lyrical content than seen from maybe any other Radiohead CD. The instrumentation and composition in the album is really what keeps it together. It combines the absolute best from both &quot;OK Computer&quot; and &quot;Kid A&quot; and blends them together seamlessly (just as the CD Now reviewer said). The more rock songs on the album like &quot;2+2=5&quot; will appeal to the fans of &quot;Ok Computer&quot;, whereas the electronically influenced songs such as &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; will please fans of &quot;Kid A&quot;. To sum it up, this latest CD combines all the best that Radiohead has to offer and is a must buy for any established Radiohead fan, or even someone new to the band. 5 Stars all the way...

B00005JM1F|4.0|How can this movie not be funny with a cast like this??<br />I thought this movie was great! It's just one of those funny movies that could actuall happen, but probably won't.  Everybody in the cast was great; I love Luke Wilson. I think this movie started off not being too terribly funny, but as the movie went on, there were more laughs.  However, it wasn't the funniest movie i've seen...and that's why I give it 4 stars.

0780626966|4.0|This is an awesome collection with the bonus and the 7 movies + the awesome 3-D glasses for Freddy's dead. The bad part is that NEW LINE CINEMAS sensored most of the gory parts. Those are the parts that make Freddy Kruegar.Most of the films are great like 1,3,4,6,&amp; 7. But 2 &amp; 5 are okay, just some what boring at times. If you are a kruegar fan &quot;ME&quot; then you'll love the bonus disk.I really reccemend it to you horror fans out there.
B00006HBUA|5.0|I don't care what anyone says Scooby Rocks. And this movie was cute. Matt Lilard did a great job as Shaggy and I thought the movie was just plain fun. My kids loved it. I can't wait for the sequal.
038572179X|3.0|I have been a fan of McEwan's other books (Enduring Love in particular), so I was quite eager to dive into this one. Especially since its debut has created such a literary buzz. Try as I might, I found the first 100 pages or so really challenging to get into, and I was curious about what this deadening pace indicated about the novel as a whole. I'm really glad that I stayed with it, since from there, the pace shifts perceptably, producing the same kind of gripping storytelling McEwan is known for. The book rides this momentum to its conclusion, but I still think the slooow opening damages an otherwise fascinating story.
B00008H2LB|5.0|i think this is the best album ever. I DIDN&quot;T THINK THAT IT WOULD BE AWESOME AS HYBRID THEORY. but it did and more than that its better than hybrid theory. LINKIN PARK IS THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD. everybody should buy this album.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I was siked when i heared they were making a 10th Star Trek. I love all the Star Trek films. I only wish i saw it in the movies. My Mom and i were planning on seeing it the first week it came out. But earlier that week she saw Joel Siegel on ABC. He said he did not like the film it was to much in the future for him so he spoiled my trip to the Movies. But i got to rent it on DVD and wish i saw it in the Movies but all is good. If i was you i would buy it.
B000002H6C|5.0|After an extended layoff period and a classic `covers' ep, Metallica returned with a vengeance on AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. All the anger and sadness they held in on the death of bassist Cliff Burton was unleashed on the record buying public. The album is full of seething vocals and complex chord and tempo changes, with melody at its centre. Lars Ulrich (drummer) and Kirk Hammet (lead guitar) have never played better. Unfortunately for new boy bassist Jason Newsted, the house producer Fleming Rasmussen buries his contributions way into the mix, so it sometimes sounds like he's absent. However, this complaint aside, if you wish to hear some truly angry heavy metal way before `Rage Against The Machine' raised its collective voice in protest, check out the true rage and beauty of this release.<br />BLACKENED - Starting, as the two previous Metallica albums on a deceptively soft note, this anti -war track suddenly roars to life with a snarl at it's heart, courtesy of James Hetfield. Jason Newsted's bass sounds like a buzz saw as Hetfield's spits out horror filled images: \\"Fire! To begin whipping dance of the dead\\". The abrupt change of pace in the track's middle only goes to prove what an impressive drummer Lars Ulrich can be. Kirk Hammet's lead solo incredibly shows an improvement since the `Master of Puppets' album. An intelligent update of the `Ride the Lightning' leadoff track, `Fight Fire With Fire'.<br />AND JUSTICE FOR ALL - Another soft build-up into a shout of protest. This time the target's the buying off of justice and the corruption of the system. The chorus is a total damnation of the unfairness of it all. Lars pounds every part of his kit in a display of virtuosity that only some metal drummers can manage. This track may be around 9 minutes in length, but I guarantee you'll be transfixed for that amount of time. \\"Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower . . .\\" Indeed.<br />EYE OF THE BEHOLDER - A strident track decrying the erosion of freedom and rights.Again,the chorus grabs you by the throat and won't let go.\\" Freedom . . . with their exception!\\" The beat on the track is very militaristic.<br />ONE - The first Metallica song with an accompanying video. This has got to be my favourite Metallica song of all time. The tale of a soldier who has stepped on a land mine and now is an armless, legless, and blind vegetable. You can almost hear the desperation, the pain and the fury of being hooked up to a life support machine in Hetfield's vocal performance. The track goes from heavy ballad to out- and-out thrash with a deft flick of the wrist. Kirk's searing lead break and Ulrich's machine gun drumming compliment the tune perfectly.<br />SHORTEST STRAW - Powerhouse, fast paced monster about paranoia, ostracism, being the victim of witchhunts and blacklisting, and mental pressure. The one thing that's a certainty on Metallica albums, are catchy choruses and `Justice . . .' has plenty of those.<br />HARVESTER OF SORROW - A lumbering evil tune about child abuse and how a victim can repeat what has happened to them on the next generation. The rhythm section sounds like an `Imperial Walker' crushing all under foot. I especially like the `answer vocal' on the chorus.<br />FRAYED EDGE OF SANITY - Beginning with a musical in-joke (the band plays `The Guards' March' from `The Wizard Of Oz') then revving up for a tale of paranoia sliding into mental illness. This is pure head banging material with a literate edge.<br />TO LIVE IS TO DIE - A fitting epitaph to supreme bassist Cliff Burton (the lyrics are his), the band puts all they have into this mournful, melodic cruncher of an instrumental that ranks up there with `Pulling Teeth', `Orion' and `The Call Of Ktutlu'. May he always be sadly missed.<br />DYER'S EVE - A thrash masterpiece to end the album. This is a scream of rage towards parents who dictate and censor without supplying love or encouragement. Hetfield's voice spews venom and the track's instrumentation is stabbing, relentless. One final roared, \\"Go!\\" and the album is finished; leaving you emotionally spent. What a musical ride.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Had no idea this series was so much fun!  I would have watched when it was on TV had I known!
B000092ZYX|4.0|Another powerful offering from Radiohead. A little more accessible than Amnesiac, but still an avant gard mix of Guitar Rock and Kraftwerk. I still like the crashing guitars of the earlier work, or the sublime splendor of OK Computer, but this is a fulfilling album. As with the best of Portishead, Beck or Pulp it demands attention from the listener. You need to give the songs a little time to sit with you, for you to really appreciate the genius of Thom York's music and lyrics. <br />The album start slowly with the heart wrenching 2+2=5 and Sail the Moon, but there are good rock highlights with There There and Go to Sleep. Each of the tracks are interesting to listen to, however this is not a happy album, so don't expect to be filled with the joys of the world.<br />Not as goods as either The Bends or OK Computer, but better than Amnesiac and it is a great deal better than anything else out at the moment. If you have not heard Radiohead before this is a good introduction as it covers many of the styles of the previous albums but develops them further.
B000092ZYX|4.0|With Hail to the Thief, Radiohead seems to have confirmed that they will not be returning to their pure Rock -n- Roll roots that characterized &quot;The Bends&quot; and to a lesser degree &quot;OK Computer&quot;.  However, Radiohead seems to have struck a very good balance of guitar rock and the electronic beats and rhythms that appeared on Kid A and Amnesiac.  Radiohead has once again demonstrated that they are one of the most innovative and creative bands in the world today.  <br />Hail to the Thief is also as lyrically sound as it is musically sound.  In an era when top 40 music is by large domniated by musicians with nothing more to sing about than all of their bling-bling, it is always refreshing to hear a band with 'something to say.<br />Hail to the Thief is very good album that will offer something new each time you listen to it due to the complexity of each song.  If you wanted Radiohead to make The Bends over again, this isn't the record for you.  If you want to hear a very original yet listenable record, Hail to the Thief will not disappoint!
B000092ZYX|5.0|As much as I loved Kid A and Amnesiac, I had always been a bigger fan of The Bends, and OK Computer. This album does a wonderful job of mixing the two styles. Though I could do without all the anti-Bush hoohaa I have to give Thom and the boys an A+ on this collection of wonderful music.
B000092ZYY|4.0|This album shows growth from Kid A and Amnesiac.  A lot of people still want 'the bends #2', which this album is not.  Thom's voice is chilling and there is less electronic noise than in their last cd.  A very good buy for any Radiohead fan
B0000029LG|5.0|The King of Pop has definitely made history with this one. Thirty songs,fifteen previously released and fifteen new ones. But Michael Jackson has had more than fifteen hit songs prior to the release of History. His other hit songs include,but are not on History,are OFF THE WALL,IN THE CLOSET,HUMAN NATURE,PYT(PRETTY YOUNG THING),WILL YOU BE THERE,SMOOTH CRIMINAL and DIRTY DIANA. It doesn't even have his very first solo hit BEN,that he recorded in his early teens in the early seventies. Some of the new songs from this album have been recycled for use for the follow-up album BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR,released in 1997. The first track on CD 2 is SCREAM,a duet with his sister Janet. Somebody commented them on this recording as &quot;Taking Control and Being Bad&quot;,referring to Michael's BAD album and Janet's CONTROL album. That SCREAM video was so cool. It looked like a science fiction film. How wonderful of Michael to have his then-wife(you know who) in the video for YOU ARE NOT ALONE. That one looked like a romance film. There's also CHILDHOOD,the theme from the film &quot;Free Willy 2&quot; and a cover of the Lennon-McCartney hit COME TOGETHER,earlier covered by Aerosmith for the movie SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND. There's also a cover of the old easy listening favorite SMILE,previously recorded by various artists. The two compact disc set is so elegantly crafted. They are a brass appearance instead of the standard aluminum. They look like digital video discs,simply known as DVD's. There are over fifty pages in the CD booklet,packed with photos of Michael taken throughout his life,the earliest as a toddler. There is,or was a 3 LP set of History,in limited quantities and limited areas. Check out,at the beginning of Track 11 on CD 2,the song called TABLOID JUNKIE. We hear the spoken words,&quot;In the news today,from the strange and weird fact file,Michael Jackson sleeps in an oxygen chamber.&quot; There's also the mention of many past dates in HISTORY. LITTLE SUSIE features a musical excerpt from the song &quot;Sunrise,Sunset&quot; from the play &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. No fan of the King of Pop should go without this outstanding album.E SUSIE features a musical excerpt from the song &quot;Sunrise,Sunset&quot; from the play &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

B000092ZYX|5.0|Once again Radiohead comes through with another great album. Its more guitar based like OK Computer, but that is mixed with the experimental elements of Kid A and Amnesiac. Some of the songs take a couple of listens to until they can be fully appreciated, but thats the way it has always been with Radiohead. The best tracks on the album are probably 2+2=5, There There, Go To Sleep, and A Wolf At the Door. However, all the songs are good. Yorke's lyrics are hard to decipher. They can be interpreted in many different ways. If you are a fan of Radiohead, this is a must have. They are one of the best rock bands out there and this album is worth buying if you are fan of rock music.

B000060P79|5.0|I had the opportunity to meet Simple Plan while working on the Mansfield, Massachusetts date of the POP DISASTER Tour. Due to my infatuation with Saves The Day, I paid very little attention to these goofy french-canadians in the tour bus. But when I heard some catchy stuff coming from the second stage, I had to investigate. And indeed it was them. Since then, I've been a fan. Even at a huge stadium radio show, I saw them rock a small second stage. Sound was tight. Quality. This band can rock hard. I've seen NFG a bunch of times, and Blink182 almost as much, and as far as I can tell - with years of show attendance - they are probably by far one of the best pop-punk bands I've ever seen. They blow NFG out of the water.<br />Now as far as the album goes, it's not perfect, but damn near close. I can't imagine a much better debut album. It's got some really catchy hits, including 3+ singles receiving radio play, and a diversity of other songs including some funny, some sad, and some slower songs. This album is an absolute must for fans of the Ataris, New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, Green Day, Blink182, Fenix TX, The All-American Rejects, or anything remotely in the pop-punk realm.<br />I would have given this CD 4.5/5.0 but that wasn't an option. However the fact that I rounded up ought to give you an indication as to how great this album really is!
B00005JKZV|5.0|All I need to say is WOW!  Could have not asked for a better movie.  It is (hard to beleive) better than the first one!  It was worth waiting in line for 3 hours for.  Can't wait for the next one!
B00009APK1|3.0|First of all, I don't think Tolkien would have been happy with the Two Towers. It  is basically a Hollywood swashbuckler. Let's look at the substantial changes in the plot. First, Aragorn did not fall over a cliff and have some quasi sexual fantasy about Arwen. Clearly a ploy to create some love interest. Let's face it, Arwen barely shows up in the books at all (except for a brief bit in the first and at the end of the third.) Then we have Eowyn. First of all, she never went to Helm's deep. She had a far more important job of protecting all of the weaker citizens at another location. And Aragorn NEVER made eyes at her. He never renounced his love of Arwen, he never denied his heritage, and he was never such a git. The only doubts he had was whether he would be able to overcome the tremedous odds.<BR>One of my biggest peeves is the assination of Faramir's character. Faramir NEVER wanted to bring the ring to his father. He was far wiser then his brother (often compared to Gandalf and the men of Numenor) and immediately recognized the threat the ring presented.<BR>The Ents were also not as clueless as protrayed in the movie.<BR>While I admire the movie for its cinematography, I believe that the definitive LOTR has yet to be made.<BR>And yes I know the flaming that this review will engender.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This album is quintessential Radiohead in every way but one: Thom Yorke. No longer does he brood in the depths of his own psyche; He now lives in the same world we do, and he is quite worried about it. This new found sobriety and connectedness of his permiates both his lyrics and voice. Every track is no longer an exsistensial life observation; character sketches and pictures of moments in the band's life make up the majority of the songs. This is not a new Radiohead by any means, but it is one that has changed with time. If you follow this band, you must own this album.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Over 5 hours. The production quality far exceeded my expectations. When you consider the Royal Albert Hall gig happened in 1970 the video and sound quality is exceptional. Its a treasure for any Led Zeppelin fan. If when you think of Zeppelin you think of Stairway to Heaven, you really need to view this compulation to see what Led Zeppelin is all about. I would have been happy at double the price. Awesome.
B000089RVX|4.0|Anyway, onto the album.  It's great.  That simple.  Amy's voice is unreal, the music is powerful, but not just in that \\"linkin park\\" way.  Just give My Immortal a listen.  The angst, the pain and loneliness, THE VIOLINS!!!  Violins in a rock song, the coolest thing ever.  seriously though, that song, and hello, sent chills up my spine.  My tourniquet is great, as is My last breath.  The whole album is great, one of the rarities that is entirely listenable.  Of course, do yourself a favor and turn off the radio, or you'll have to skip track #2 soon enough.

B000002KIE|5.0|The Sex Pistols.  One of punk's most controversial bands.  Not becuase of their antics, but becuase of the dispute whether they were \\"fake\\", \\"sellouts\\", \\"untalented\\", etc.  Of course, we've all heard a Crass fan complaining about how they were fake sellouts on a major label and playing classic rock, but personally, I just try to judge the music.  And let me tell you, the Pistols ROCK.<br />Sure, the album's not very fast, and it was exteremly popular, trendy, and mainstream, but what it lacks in \\"punkness\\", it makes up for in attitude and damn good rock 'n' roll.  If the Ramones were looking for a good time, the Pistols were looking for a fight.  Thier songs are about betrayal, anarchy, and even abortions.  Every song is a classic and will get stuck in your head at one point in your life after owning this album.  \\"Anarchy in the UK\\", \\"God Save the Queen\\", \\"Bodies\\"...all pure punk rock classics.  If you think punk is based on blistering tempos and screamed lyrics (not that I have anything against that, I love Minor Threat and the Germs), you might want to stay away from this album.  Even though it's true that the Pistols' message of anarchy was more for fashion usage, it doesn't mean they didn't rock!  If this album isn't in your collection, you're either not into punk at all, or you're a Crass fan who hates the Clash and Sex Pistols.  However, if you're into punk and DON'T own this...seriously, spare yourself the humiliation of someone finding out and go buy this, honestly.
B000092ZYX|2.0|I give up - sorry guys.  I absolutely loved OK Computer.  Being somewhat disappointed with Kid A (other than &quot;Everything...&quot; and &quot;Disappear...&quot;) I went out and bought Amnesiac in the hope of something better - no luck.  Not having much luck with this new album either, although &quot;Scatterbrain&quot; and &quot;Wolf&quot; come close to what I liked so much on OK Computer.  Does this make me too mainstream?  If so then I guess Radiohead have lost a fan.
B00000K19E|5.0|Let me just point out that I'm not a fan of sci fi's or action movies, but when my friend, Miguel, brought it 'round to my house I was totally blasted away! The story is brilliant, the stunts are amazing, esp. the bullet time stuff. Also, I'm a girl and most girls think that the Matrix wouldn't appeal to them. Girls, try it, you will be really suprised. I can't wait for more Matrix.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Radiohead keeps getting better as they go along; this album is no exception. Don't want to blab much so i don't spoil the album, but if you love radiohead, BUY THIS ALBUM ASAP!

B000092ZYX|5.0|Many people have said that Radiohead's sixth studio album, 'Hail to the Thief' is simply a combination of OK Computer's progressive rock combined with the techno driven 'Kid-A'. HTTF is niether. The album begins with a classic feeling of OK Computer with 2+2=5, a progressive rock masterpiece in which singer Thom Yorke goes off into his insane prog. rock antics he is renown for. Another one of the album's ingenius songs is Sail to the Moon. This song sounds like it was from the OK Computer sessions. It's mellow and haunting opening keyboard riff start you off into a 4 minute incredible journey of Radiohead at their best. The album's 14 tracks are all equally impressive and proves that while there are not many bands up to par nowadays, Radiohead is one that exceeds what most people expect out of bands from the past 10 years. With each of their albums being so different from one another and HTTF being another instant classic, it appears Radiohead will be around for years to come and their music will be cherished for decades. 'Hail to the Thief' is a classic and every music lover should purchase this to see Radiohead's sheer brilliance.
B000096I9G|3.0|Your response to this DVD will depend almost entirely on your previous feelings about the Cure, particularly the 'dark' albums - Pornography, Disintegration, and Bloodflowers.  These discs document a one-off performance of this 'Trilogy' (a post facto descriptor; I don't believe Smith had a trilogy in mind when he recorded Pornography) in its entirety, in chronological order. <br />That said, the performances and musicianship are top-notch, the camera work is good, and the stage set and lighting are, well, non-distracting, I suppose.  Disintegration and Bloodflowers sound very much as they do on the original releases, with a bit of speed and energy added as a function of live performance.  The Pornography set, however, is a real revelation - driven, aggressive versions of a well-written song cycle that was abjectly performed and produced on the original studio release.  <br />If you like early Cure, but have grown aurally discriminating enough to cringe at the stodgy production of their earlier work, this disc will open your ears to the truly excellent songcraft buried in the mix, particularly on Pornography.  I believe this will become the 'definitive' version of Pornography, finally performed and recorded in the manner its creators intended. <br />The extras are fine, but for the die-hard fan only, I suppose.  I could only watch so much interview footage featuring the various band members mumbling about the performance.  Robert Smith is kind of articulate and funny in certain spots, though.  3.5 stars.
6305907145|4.0|Mansfield Park is the least favorite of Jane Austen's novels for me.  I always got the feeling that she was warring with her own impulses and instincts to come up with its proper, rather formal ending.  It feels like an ugly duckling growing phase in her oeuvre, so now we come to this film of the book.  Evidently they had the same problems so many of us did with Fanny Price's 'passivity ', so they tried to make her into a more shrewdly observant commentator like her creator was, which was an interesting approach.  ( I had seen the BBC version by the way in which Fanny seemed like the little shocked mouse radiating potent disapproval on an entire household, psychically manipulating others or trying to in the name of prudent conduct.)  By making Fanny more like Jane, they tried to make her more approachable, admirable, but a little of the subtleties of the family's interactions was lost - due to time demands in that format, which were inescapable in the novel and BBC version.  I did not mind that approach, except that it made it even more excruciating when Henry Crawford ( Alessandro Nivola ) turns up, flirts shamelessly with the Bertram sisters, only to recognize something better or more compelling about Fanny Price and to court her instead.  Mr. Nivola really brings that charming scoundrel to life, so much so that it is torture to watch Fanny accept and then reject him.  You sympathize more for him and you suddenly see why he would act out the way he does after Fanny's treatment of him.  In this casting, the performance itself on Mr. Nivola's part, and the choices of the filmmaker, this film shines a harsh light on what seemed like an unsatisfactory choice that Jane Austen made.  The original ending seems like a clinical imposition and the film reminds one of the road not taken.  The character of Edmund was wonderfully cast too, but still, and no one seems to have brought this up even in the book reviews, Edmund and Fanny are FIRST COUSINS.  I mean...EWWW!  (It makes one wish for a time machine, so one could go back and have a little chat about genetics and social taboos with Jane Austen.)  If you loved the novel as it was, then you won't like this movie.  If you found Henry Crawford beguiling in the novel, this movie will be a wonderful torment, until it becomes frustrating when Jane Austen's plot goes it's inevitable way.s one wish for a time machine, so one could go back and have a little chat about genetics and social taboos with Jane Austen.)

B00005JM1F|3.0|This movie is hilarious, and I would give the movie itself 4 our of 5 stars.  But there is hardly any difference between the unrated cut and the R rated cut of the movie.  When you have topless women on the menu and on the back of the cover, one might be mislead to think there was tons more nudity, when in reality there are 2 brief scenes with any type of nudity (besides will ferrel's butt scene).  This movie could have easily passed the R rating cut, as the unrated thing is nothign but a marketing ploy.   I bought the movie for laughs and definately not for sex, but for someone who does, the \\"UNRATED AND OUT OF CONTROL\\" part is quite misleading.
B000093BDX|3.0|You'd think with the subtitle -Sounds of Summer- and the cover art being what it is, \\"The Warmth of the Sun\\" would be among the 30 tracks. There are several songs, in my opinion, that could have been swapped for the non-charting favorite, if 30 was the limit. Good Timin', for example, was on the charts for one week, at #40. Maybe there'll be a -Sounds of Summer II-!  It might include \\"All Summer Long\\" and \\"Surf's UP!\\" and \\"Things We Did Last Summer.\\"
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park's new album is really cool. I think that it is better than Hybrid Theory because it is kind of a concept album. I like how all the songs flow into each other. There are no spaces in between tracks, so when one song ends, BAM ! another one starts. Here is a review of each track:<br />1. Foreward - I have heard from various sources that this is Mike Shinoda, the rapper vocalist of LP, destroying his cd burner. It is kind of a cool start to the album. 3/5<br />2. Don't Stay - This is a really heavy song, with Chester Bennington doing all the vocals. It's quite good. 4/5<br />3. Somewhere I Belong - The album's first single. The backwards acoustic guitar at the beginning of the song is cool. Mike is the main singer on this song. I enjoy hearing this song every time. 5/5<br />4. Lying From You - This song is really good. Chester and Mike both sing evenly on this song. Another cool song. 5/5<br />5. Hit The Floor - Kind of a heavy rap/rock song. Mike sings mostly on this one. It's an o.k. one, but Chester yells too much in this one. 3/5<br />6. Easier To Run - A great song. Sounds like it could have been on Hybrid Theory. Chester sings mostly on this one. Hopefully it will be considered to become a single 5/5<br />7. Faint - The album's second single. This song is my favorite off the album. I always look forward to hearing this song if I'm listening to the c.d. from Track 1 - 13. I love the beat of the song. Mike sings mostly on this one. This song has strings in it, which is a nice touch. 10/5 (just kidding) 5/5<br />8. Figure .09 - Pretty good song, I think. I can't think of much to say about this one. Mike and Chester evenly sing on this one. 4/5<br />9. Breaking The Habit - Awesome song. The beat is really good on this one. There are strings in this one as well. Chester sings all the time on this song. 5/5<br />10. From The Inside - Basically the same review for this one as the previous song. Chester all the way through, as well. 5/5<br />11. Nobody's Listening - The hip-hop song on the album. Mike is the main singer on this song. I like how they added a Chinese flute (I think) to this song. It is really cool to hear. 4/5<br />12. Session - Here the DJ Mr. Hahn gets to rip it up on his turntables and programming devices. This piece is better than &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot; because it has a more heavier beat and overall sound. No vocals on this song. 3/5<br />13. Numb - Good song to close a great album with. Chester is the main singer. 4/5<br />If you are thinking of buying this album, please do, it will probably become a classic album someday, plus you will listen to it many times over, like me.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I think the series of Smallville rocks.  When it first came out I watched every episode.  I would love to watch every episode still, but unfortunately I work on Tuesday nights, and Sunday nights so I don't have time to watch it anymore, that's why I want it to come out on DVD, so I can enjoy all episodes whenever I want.  The cast is really good.  They picked a good bunch of young stars for the roles.
B000062TU1|4.0|Harry in the book is the modern day Cinderella. He was a reviled slave in the Dursleys' home and getting the tar whipped out of him on the playground, but he wasn't submissive to the abuse. And his parents were murdered for god sakes on top of that. He fought for his own freedoms but took the punishment as well as anybody, in other words exactly the kind of rebel who always gets the short end of the stick and you want to fight for in any sort of a brawl. This version of Harry, the everyman, strong, independent hero kid didn't exactly come accross in the first half hour of the movie. That means that people who haven't read the book can't really get into the movie because they can't root for Harry, and that's what the whole series is about, and that's why you'd sit down for two and a half hours of kiddy fantasy. The same thing that happens when you've read the book in Harry's case occurs with practically every other character. Everyone just blossoms, and you notice nice details that fly completely under the radar when you haven't read the books.<br />One thing that fans may notice is that the literary HP series has more jilted visual style than the movies do, but I say you've got to let that go. Just because Hermione isn't in dire need of braces, and you can actually see Hagrid's face, doesn't diminish the good realization of each characters' personalities.<br />In conclusion, if you're willing to spend the two and a half hours watching the movie, you can afford to spend one night sitting down to read the book, it reads a lot faster than it's couple of hundred pages might indicate.
B00008977N|5.0|I cannot understand everyone's complaint on the quality of the film.  I first watched this on DISNEY, viewed the VHS version, and watched the DVD.  All look and sound exactly the same.  <BR>Don't be picky, and enjoy.
0440237688|2.0|I recently read The Giver in class.  I personally didn't enjoy it.  I thought Lous Lowery didn't do a good job of sticking to her story line.  In some parts of the book she would say one thing the community did then the next chapter she would say something tatally opposite making the book not flow and make sense.  Ialso thought the ending was to sudden and didn't answer any questions i had.
B000008LL1|5.0|THUNDER FOR SOME REASON HAS NEVER GAINED THE POPULARITY IN THIS COUNTRY THAT THEY HAVE IN ENGLAND AND JAPAN.THIS BAND IS AWESOME AND EVERY CD THEY HAVE EVER PUT OUT KICKS TAIL ESPECIALLY THIS ONE.ANYONE WHO LIKES HARD ROCK AND METAL NEEDS TO CHECK OUT THIS GREAT ALBUM AND BAND.I THINK ONCE ANYONE GIVES THEIR MUSIC A CHANCE THEY WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT THIS IS THE MOST UNDERRATED AND OVERLOOKED BAND EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
B000084T18|4.0|This is a great cd to just listen to, though I wouldn't play it too loud when your parents are around. It's not exactly the Mona Lisa of cds, but if you can get it with cash to spare, Id buy it for some head boppin beats and original lyrics. 5o has been overhyped, however. He doesn't live up to it. He's still pretty good though, but he's no way the next biggy or tupac.<BR>1.Intro-Nuthin much. A coin droppin.<BR>2. What up gangsta-A cool song with a fast beat. Good to sing along to<BR>3.Patiently waiting-Awesome. 50 and Eminem rap great in this dark,moody song.<BR>4. Many men- I don't like it, the song is slo and a little boring. Talks about people shooting him.<BR>5. In da club-Dif. from radio version, but u know how it goes.<BR>6.High all the time-It sounds stupid, but's a real good song.<BR>7.Heat-Don't play very loud, but its not that good anyway.<BR>8.If I can't- Nice, bouncy, lite 'without me'-esque song.<BR>9.Blood Hound-Nuthin spesh, but not bad.<BR>10.Back down- Ja Rule diss in a cool beat.<BR>11. P.I.M.P.-One of my fave songs, better than the remix with snoop dogg..<BR>12.Like my style- To lite 4 me, but u might like it.<BR>13.Poor lil rich- Listen to it once, just in case u might like it.<BR>14.21 Questions-Great love song with the 50 twist, but it's been played on the radio too much.<BR>15. Don't push me- Great dark song, equal to patiently waitin.<BR>16. Gotta Make it to heaven- Great song to chill out 2.<BR>Bonus cuts- Above average.<BR>I would buy this album. Fifty shows a lot of promise with most of the songs, and with a little polishing he could be one of the best. However, lets hope he stops with songs like poor lil rich, blood hound, like my style and Heat.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This album is a prime example of why Radiohead are who they are. The greatest band of all time. If albums like The Bends,<BR>OK Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac didnt make believers out of the rest of the non-believers out there, then Hail to the Thief should do just that.
B00008PX8P|5.0|An excellent visual and aural history of the seminal blues/rock/metal band at the height of their prowess.  Watch John Bonham solo on 'Moby Dick' and see why Led broke-up after his untimley death.<BR>The DVD is chock-full of music, interviews and promos (that's what Video's were called back then) and the digital re-mastering is absolutely wonderful.  In some areas it's so sharp, you'll think you're hallucinating, but NO, it's for real. <BR>A must for any Rock 'N Roll fan, absolutely essential for any Led Zeppelin fans.  <BR>PLAY IT LOUD!!!
6305499365|5.0|Hilarious movie - maybe a little TOO realistic in some parts. I think many of us have had our fair share of jobs like this, and if you have, you immediately connect to this movie. Great jokes, although maybe a little depressing if you're still stuck in that world. Very glad my current job isn't like this! Oh yeah, and great soundtrack. ^.^
B000089RVX|5.0|I never write reviews, but I gotta tell you - this CD ROCKS!! As the music director of a mid-market CHR radio station, you have no idea the amount of material that comes to my desk on a daily basis. From the moment I heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\" I was hooked. So were my listeners. I waited impatiently for the CD to be released, and was not diappointed - not one bad track. Well balanced all around, vocals, lyrics, instrumental arrangement, production....I hope (expect!) for big things in their future.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I loved this album, I loved how she sung all different styles of music, it shows how strong her voice is. This album is a big step up from genie in a bottle, this is a really good cd to purchase!!!! Go Christina!!!!!!!!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead has released another excellent album, even after six albums Radiohead is still going strong.  The album is more rock oriented than Kid A, making it closer to OK Computer and The Bends in style but there is no way to truely compare Radiohead albums because each is very destinctive.  Hail to the Thief has a darker and more mysterious sound than previous releases by Radiohead but this goes with the nature of the world and media attention today.  The songs are a good mixture, some jazz and blues with electronic and rock thrown in.  \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" is the most down beat song in the album but is well done.  \\"2+2=5\\" is a great song that starts out calm and melodious but then rocks out.  The beats in this album are some of Radioheads best yet.  This album has a few supprises for Radiohead fans and will be greatly appreciated.  I highly recomend this album to Radiohead fan and rock fans who want to understand the Radiohead phenomenon.  Radiohead will be reflected upon like the Beatles, as musical alchemists.
B000003TA4|5.0|Back in the late 1980's, a countless amount of hair bands were polluting the radio and MTV and killing the ozone layer. It seemed like there was no end in sight. Until 1991...<br />There's a reason why this is listed as one of the most influential albums ever released. Sure, the music might sound simple at first listen, but listen harder. Kurt Cobain is pouring his heart and soul out in this recording (and all of his other ones) for everyone to hear. He was telling the tale of Generation X: the long-haired, moody, grungy teenagers who just stopped caring. And he described them to a T. Which could be why &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; sparked a revolution in 1991: people haven't heard anything like it before on mainstream radio, and were fascinated by the louder, angrier sounds they were hearing coming from their speakers. <br />But nevermind that. (no pun intended) If you're an alternative music fan, you probably own this. If not, this album combines punk, alternative, grunge with great pop melodies that helped this album sell millions of copies. Every single song on here is good, there is no need to skip over any. Just pick this one up, blast it, and let the good times roll. Total Nirvana!
B00005YW4H|4.0|Very nice, its a pleasurable collection. Leave alone the grammys, it won't disappoint.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I remember 1995-96. When songs like \\"Just a Girl\\", \\"Spiderwebs\\", and \\"Don't Speak\\" were all over the radio. They were fun, catchy alternative rock songs that actually had something to say. But THIS....what IS this supposed to be, anyway? Boys and girls, No Doubt have officially sold out to the masses. Sad but true. Don't believe me? Listen to anything off of Tragic Kingdom and then \\"Hey Baby\\" back-to-back. Don't you try to tell me they didn't sell out. Oh, and let's not forget the lyrics. \\"All the boys say hey baby, hey baby, hey!\\" I'm sorry, but isn't this the band that PROTESTED sexism eight years ago in \\"Just a Girl\\"? Also, they went from \\"Don't Speak, I know just what you're sayin', so please stop explainin', don't tell me 'cuz it hurts\\" to \\"The music's hella good, so I'm-a keep on dancin'!\\" WHAT THE-! What's next, \\"Eenie Meenie Miney Moe\\"? It's a sad state of affairs. No Doubt (or should I say Gwen Stefani) is dead to me now.
B00005JLK1|5.0|This is an excellent movie, I'm a fifteen yearold teenager, 'surprise surprise' who enjoyed this tremendously. I thought The Shining was rather boring to be honest with you...so come on, live a little.

B000093BDX|5.0|The BEACH BOYS, more than any other born and bred AMERICAN band, are the ultimate American Dream band that has ever existed. Their superbly crafted, passionately executed music personifies those sunny breezy good times and some of the images that embody the American way of life. Originally inspired instrumentally by guitar hero Chuck Berry and musically composed by genius and brain-child leader BRIAN WILSON, this band created its very own unique identifiable sound, which has never waned throughout their forty plus year history. The Beach Boys have never submitted to any musical trends and have maintained their artistic integrety from day one. The greatest part and focal point of the Beach Boys music is their incredibly embellished trademark harmonies and multiple lead vocalists' impassioned narratives. Neil Diamond once wrote and sang,\\"everywhere around the world, they come to America\\"...the beach, surfing, great music, cars, boats, girls, good friends, school,love, marriage and simply having fun and enjoying this great life through all the ups and downs. The BEACH BOYS simply captivate the listener's mind and imagination through their music. Thirty of their most memorable classic Top 40 radio-chart hits are included here in brilliant and shimmering remastered sound. There's something here for everybody out there, fan or non-fan, this cd constitutes a musical celebration of a great American band from 1962 through 1988. Even so, they could've opted for a combination of either \\"All Summer Long\\"-\\"Wendy\\"-\\" and \\"It's O.K.\\" instead of \\"Wild Honey\\" and \\"I Can Hear Music\\". SOUNDS OF SUMMER will brighten your day and put a smile on your face even through a harsh cold winter. Don't pass up this disc of \\"ESSENTIAL MUST HAVE\\" music by the BEACH BOYS!
6302799066|5.0|Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece, pure and simple, and still ranks as my favorite movie of all time (I've seen it eighteen times). It is extremely funny, but also scary and unsettling. Its crazy plot doesn't seem all that implausible, and despite the Cold War motif, still seems eerily relevant today. Indeed, the idea of one loony trying to kill millions with weapons of mass destruction seems straight out of today's headlines. The script is spare and brilliant: as another reviewer put it, there is not one wasted line. The pacing is taut and the acting, superb. Peter Sellers was terrific in each of the three roles he played. George C. Scott was also excellent, and Sterling Hayden is awsome as one of my favorite film nut-jobs. This film represents the great Stanley Kubrick at the apex of his talents as a director, and along with another of his films: \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is arguably the greatest black comedy ever made. Dr. Strangelove is a \\"must own\\" for any serious film lover.
B000002GJH|5.0|It's true. That's all there is to say. Everyone by now should know the story of how Andy Wood was living with Cornell, and in MLB with Jeff and Stone when he OD'd. This masterpiece was released in 1990, but since no one knew anything about Landrew, or Soundgarden, the album failed. Then Pearl Jam makes it big, the album is re-released as a pre-Pearl Jam album, instead of a Chirs Cornell side project, and is still selling today.<BR>     The way the song are composed and played is just amazing. I even thought that the guys would get together for a Layne Staley tribute, but they didn't. Anyway, if you dont own this record, what the hell is wrong with you? It is only 10 tracks, but is the greatest 55 minute listening experience of your life!
B000002HH9|5.0|Why does this record always get shot down by fans of the Cure?  It is a great album, with a variety of sounds and moods.  The arrangement reminds me a lot of Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me, which any fan knows is an exellent record.  The different instruments used reminds me of the Head on the Door, another exellent record.  This record is truly worth a listen.
0788821075|4.0|Pretty Woman, directed by Garry Marshall, is a modern day Cinderella story starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.  Julia Roberts won Best Actress in 1990 at the Academy Awards and Best Actress in 1991 at the Golden Globe for her performance in this movie.<br />Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) is a rich businessman who recently broke up with his girlfriend.  He travels to Los Angles for a business trip and gets lost on his way to the Beverly Hills Hotel.  While asking for directions he makes the acquaintance of free-spirited hooker Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) who makes her living as a prostitute on Hollywood Boulevard.  After she stays the night at his suite he offers her money if she'll stay with him for the entire week.  He needs an \\"escort\\" for his rich and famous parties.  Of course, this is to be a platonic relationship. She takes him up on his generous offer of money, clothes, jewelry and a make-over.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for her.<br />Edward soon learns that Vivian is more than a girl from the sidewalk.  Vivian is attracted to Edward but knows they are from two different worlds and it could never work.  Edward's ruthless co-worker Phil (Jason Alexander) makes sure Vivian realizes she has no future with Edward.  Edward begins to see that he is a better person when he is around Vivian.  Vivian gets a chance to start her life over again.<br />I give Pretty Women four stars.  It is a romantic comedy. This is a modern-day fairy tale, a true Cinderella story.  Although, I hope this movie doesn't give young girls the idea that prostitution is a glamorous way to make a living.
0316921173|2.0|But I have no idea what this book is about. I feel like I am reading a book written by someone with a large vocabulary who's trying to use all his big words. This is a cumbersome book, literally and figuratively. I have no idea what is going on!! Save your money and go look in the bargin area for some good books!
B00005JLRT|1.0|Disclaimers: My wife and I are dyed-in-the-wool STTNG fans, preferring it to the original series (which we like, too).  We've seen every episode and every movie, and enjoyed even those that weren't the best.<br />We snuck into this film late one night after watching \\"The Two Towers\\" -- and you know what?  It wasn't even worth the money we didn't pay to see it.<br />This is by far the most slap-dash godawful mess of a film bearing the words \\"Star Trek\\" that has ever been made.  Whether it's Picard doing a Mad Max impression as he drives his land rover at breakneck speed to outrace the villians, or the long (very long) and boring (very boring -- the pacing of these scenes make you think the very first ST movie was an MTV video) sequences between Picard and his \\"Nemesis\\" you'll swear you're in some kind of ST hell.  Nothing makes any sense here: from supposed bright leaders of a country watching (and not otherwise moving) as someone sets a bomb in front of them, activates it, and then walks away (boy, do I want *these* guys as my enemies :>) to a \\"sacrifice\\" ending that you can see coming an hour or three away (the movie seems like it takes four hours) you won't believe a thing you see or hear.<br />Prior to making this movie Stewart was pooh-poohing rumors this was the last film: as soon as he saw the released product he promptly announced he wouldn't be playing Picard anymore.  I think that about says it all.<br />It's a pity the series is going to end with a whimper and not a bang, but I suspect completists are going to have to have this in their collection, just as I am sure they will never take it off the shelf to watch more than once.  Do yourself a favor and save your pennies to buy one or more seasons of the excellent series, and remember this cast at their far better best.
B00008LDPU|4.0|You know, if George Lucas had had a similar idea there would be more than a few who would eagerly relish snippets of various happenings in the world of Star Wars. Of course the origins of Lucas' epic trilogy (and not so epic prequels) were not based in Japanese, post-apocalyptic anime as with the Wachowski Bros. Who wouldn't want more glimpses into the world of The Matrix? As with any intriguing movie, the fans want more, more, more. And more is what you get here in The Animatrix.<br />Of course, one can only stand so much gun-slinging, wire-working, kung-fu fight scenes. And if the producers of The Matrix had endeavored to feed us another helping of that it would surely taste bland. So, they treat us to some of the best animation directors on the planet and even allow various writers to collaborate on 5 of the 9 projects (the other 4 the brothers W. wrote themselves).<br />Read the other reviews if you want a break-down of each episode...of course I liked some better than others. Regardless, I really appreciate being exposed to each of these different types of animation. Each of them are compelling to me. I've viewed the various shorts several times as well as some of the extra features and I know I'll keep coming back to them, as the imagery is spectacular. Even if I really love a DVD, I rarely watch it more than once per year or so...it's too time consuming. With this one, I can simply watch one at a time and ponder the implications.<br />I highly recommend this, and thank the directors and producers for exposing me to some new styles of story-telling. You'll thank them too!
B000092ZYX|5.0|This album is definetley one of Radiohead's best. Filled with amazing lyrics and complex melodies, this is an album you don't want to miss.

B00008V5VN|5.0|i picked this up, my first album by sleep.  i've read a lot of reviews about it so i'll tell you what i've heard from reliable sources.<br />dopesmoker is an alternate recording/early version of sleep's epic jerusalem.  it has a heavier mix and a more dynamic sound and is a little longer than the origional recording plus the live track 'sonic titan'.  i read a lot about how this is just one riff for about fifty minutes, which is sort of true.  they made it sound as if it got 'boring' or 'repetitive' in a bad way. i disagree since the album is rather trance inducing, moves along at a great pace, and there are plenty of riff alterations, solos, and vocal parts in the song to break up any kind of monotony.  i felt the song changes when it should and held my attention very well.  the album worked best when i'm either stoned(of course) or am simply relaxing in my room doing mindless tasks or anything at all. it 'accompanies' me and that is pretty cool to have another album like that. <br />the live track is great too.  i understand the sleep's influence in later stoner/doom bands now when listening to stuff like bongzilla.  if you like this, i would recommend any earth album, starting with either earth2 or pentastar. it's all great stuff.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|This movie is really tough to describe or classify to somebody who hasn't seen it. It's THAT original. I think of it as a deep movie for shallow people, a darkling \\"Dead Poets Society\\" run through with heaping doses of \\"Rushmore\\"-ish satire and \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" bitterness and disillusionment. The title character is a deeply troubled suburban wonderboy going to a private school who is haunted by this spectral, demonic being in a bunny suit, who begins to become, as Vonnegut would say, \\"unstuck in time\\" (which I recall him saying was a metaphor for going insane). This seems definitely the case.<br />Stylistically, it is very interesting; the director has a great eye in places, putting together some enticing, effective scenes that are pretty to look at.<br />Thematically, though, it sort of implodes under the weight of its own pretensions. The beginning and the end loop together in a way that (in my opinion) ultimately blows down the house of cards set up in the first place. Donnie seems to dish things out without ever taking it, an adolescent fantasy if ever there was one. Without wanting to spoil it, a problem I had with the movie is that it seems to answer the teen angst retort of \\"maybe everybody would be happier if I was DEAD!!\\" That's as good a way of summing it up as any other.<br />The DVD is worthwhile, particularly because of the 20-some deleted/extended scenes one can watch with or without commentary. They offer additional perspective to the viewer that is absent in the movie. Is it worth your time? Sure, why not? Watch it. But it feels like more an exercise in style for its own sake than something offering any real substance.
B000000W5P|3.0|Once again &quot;the abkco/Virgin music releases cheat the Americans!<BR>On this Virgin CD, Virgin/abkco, left us only the 'short' American song titles.  Most of the original tracks are on 12&quot; 45rpm vinyl, usually 6-8 minutes duration.  All we get here in the States is the leftover 2-3 minute 'for U.S. consumption only tracks.  The Europeans have access to the full-length versions.<BR>Try &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot;, it was a 2-3 minute 45rpm, for U.S. consumption.  It is also a 12&quot; 45rpm vinyl, and on CD at 8:15 min.  We are being cheated by track elimination-marketing.<BR>apa
B00005OAIE|2.0|You'll like this CD if you are a young woman or girl <BR>that wishes that men would stop behaving like men and<BR>be more sensitive. Or if you don't listen to music thats <BR>not played on your favorite top 40 station. Or if you are <BR>a gay man. <br />Otherwise, its just not worth it. Slow, boring, musically uninteresting with silly lyrics that make a grown man want<BR>to gag.<br />But I don't like Dave Matthews either, so don't be surprised <BR>that I don't like John Mayer
B000092ZYX|5.0|The vocal harmonies alone are amazing.<br />Having heard a handful of the songs previously--I avoided the unfinished mixes leaked a few months back, but checked out official previews--I bought the CD and have now listened to the album once through, and am blown away by the complexity and denseness of &quot;Hail to the Thief.&quot;  Music like this is created to reward repeat listenings, and I can't wait to listen repeatedly, to catch the thousands of gems hiding throughout the album.  It was truly overwhelming the first time.<br />I recommend the album to anyone with an attention span and a hunger for challenging, beautiful music.
078322737X|4.0|Great movie and good DVD, some nice extras on this, and you get to see some of the actors so young.  The songs thoughout this are excellent and tie in very well with what is going on with this movie
0743424425|4.0|This is a Stephen King classic, and is rendered my many fan's his best work ( i disagree, however, with 'Salems Lot &amp; a few others being his best work IMHO). What is so suspensful about this book is the fact that you don't know when the main character, Jack Torrance, is going to explode and turn into the homocidal maniac Mr. King describes indrirectly in great detail he is. While this is a disturbing and very suspensful, it does tend to drag on and on a bit, sagging the story line - which was the only reason i brought it to 4 stars. Great novel - highly reccomended!
B000002GXJ|5.0|IF there is a better *LIVE* album out there, I'd like to know what it is, because I've never heard it.  The Eagles have always been one of my favorite bands, and after I came upon this album, I made up my mind to see them in concert as soon as I could.  Unfortunately, by the time I got my hands on this cassette, they had already broke up.  Really bad timing on my part.  But that didn't stop my complete facination with their music.  I just couldn't believe how they managed to sound SO GOOD on stage, versus some of the truly... groups I had seen live (some of which are really good, but IN person, well they stunk).  One of my personal favorite cuts has to be 'Seven Bridges Road', while never a major commercial success, it IS however one incredibly GREAT song, done FANTASTIC in concert.  But never fear, they have managed to include just about each and every one of their best songs on this complilation, including: 'The Long Run', 'Heartache Tonight', 'I Can't Tell You Why', 'Take It To The Limit' & 'Desperado' and let's not forget 'Hotel California'.  About the only song I found that I wished they had included, but didn't was 'In The City' from The Long Run CD.  Maybe an additional Joe Walsh tune, but basically I can't complain.<br /><br />Not long ago, I had the MAJOR opportunity to fulfill my dream of seeing the Eagles LIVE in concert, and without question, it was THE BEST sounding concert I have EVER seen.  I work in radio and over the years I have been most fortunate to have had the chance to see a LOT of concerts, and the Eagles blew them ALL away.  Absolutely NO contest (other than Glenn Frey attempting to sing 'You Belong To The City' and not able to hit the high notes...).  Their ability to capture the *sound* of their recorded songs is incredible.  If you enjoy the Eagles (and I cannot imagine you NOT), IF you get that chance to see them perform on stage, do NOT shy away from the high ticket price (and I DO understand it can be pricey), but it will be WELL worth the price--TRUST ME.  NOBODY does it better *LIVE* than the Eagles.the price--TRUST ME.  NOBODY does it better *LIVE* than the Eagles.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Fans are so fickle.  Most of the people that I have talked to say that they wish Radiohead would return to playing music from the Bends era.  I, however, tend to think that what Radiohead is doing is moving forward in a good way.  They always manage to keep things innovative every time they release a new feature.  And a feature is quite what it is.  Starting out with subtle electronic bleeps, you might think &quot;Kid A&quot; at first, however when Thom's familiar falsetto comes in clear, understandable tones (as opposed to the blurred style highlighted in Amnesiac), you know that it is going to be a great cd.  The techno bloops and bleeps are here still, but it is definately in a good sense, and the vocals are hardly ever if at all overpowered.  This special edition cd includes a HTTT &quot;road map&quot; poster inset and a very nice booklet with the lyrics and other information in it.  There is no cd case with it, but if that is no big deal to you then this edition is great.
B000002OX7|5.0|I am fifteen years old, and I am convinced that three of some of the greatest rock and roll songs of all time are on this one album.  Baba O'Riley, Behind Blue Eyes, and, of course, Won't Get Fooled Again are all in the top 20 on my list. Not only that, but there are no bad songs on this album.  Every album has fillers or throwaway songs, except for a select few.  This is a truly special album, and it is only bettered by one other: \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\", or the untitled album.  That has got to be the number one album of all time.  Buy both.<BR>The album starts off with the explosive Baba O'Riley, which is instantly distinguishable with the opening synthesizor. It's absolutely fantastic.  I think that when artists try to mix with special effects in the studio, that they usually fall flat on their face, but the intro to this song really does it justice. It's a jewel of classic rock, and everyone should like it.  Everyone.  The lyrics may be a little weird, but let's face it, most rock and roll lyrics are. This song is almost flawless.  After the breathtaking opener, the album segueways into \\"Bargain\\", which really is a funny song - \\"The best I EVER HAD!!!\\"  Anyway, it's a good old fashioned rock song.  Not too soft, and not too hard. Then comes \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\".  I think this is really a good showpiece of Roger Daltrey's voice. The song itself isn't much, but listen how he stretches his voice out in the verses! Then comes \\"My Wife\\" which is a lot of people's favorite, as I understand. It's really more of a pop song, but that's alright. It's a funny song, and it's nice to hear John Entwistle's voice for a change.  \\"The Song is Over\\" is really an underrated song, I think.  It's an honest song about breaking up, and Daltrey does an awesome job with the vocals.  I'm glad this is the second longest song on the album. \\"Gettin' in Tune\\" is probably the worst song on the album, but it's not bad, either.  I like it.  \\"Goin' Mobile\\" is also a classic, and it's funny how Pete Townshend is able to write a song like this about driving. He's an air condition gypsie! \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" is, I think, the greatest ballad ever recored by a rock group.  Better than \\"Yesterday\\", better than \\"Imagine\\". It's an honest song about being a person with no friends, who's hated by everyone. And he blames you!  This song is so deep, I don't even understand some parts, with my being only a teenager. And lastly comes \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\".  I cannot begin to describe what a good song this is.  Oh my gosh.  When I go to the restaurant, I turn this song on on the jukebox every time.  It's the greatest rock song ever, by far! The intro, similar to Baba O'Riley, is so cool, and I love the guitar riffs and the siinging of Daltrey - everything. Listen t othat drumming! The guitar work on this song is rivaled by only one other: Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Free Bird\\".  Even if the lyrics don't make sense, that's okay - they don't need to. This is pure, 100% rock and roll almost all the way through. This is clearly, clearly the greatest rock and roll song ever.<BR> Very few albums can even come close to measuring up to this one - \\"Revolver\\" by the Beatles, \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\", \\"The Wall\\" by Pink Floyd, the Bestles' \\"White Album, and that's about it! Any album with songs like \\"Baba O'Riley, \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" should be in every rock and roll lover's collection.  <BR>Oh yeah, one more thing.  Keith Moon, not John Bonham, is the greatest drummer ever.
B000092Q4U|5.0|In an era marked by melodic death metal bands like, soilwork, in flames, and dark tranquility. It seems as though more bands are experimenting with thrash type elements, but keeping the same flare that they had on their previous albums. Lamb of God, Darkest Hour, and Shadows fall just to name a few. Shadows Fall put out the best of 2002 in my opinion with The Art of Balance, and Lamb of God's newest offering \\"As the Places Burn\\" is the best offering so far. <br />In this album you won't find one genre that they didn't include. Melodic Death like riffs, Thrashy delivery, and some good old black metal and death metal tremelo picks and screams.<br />They album jumps into your soul right off the bat with ruin. This song's breakdown made my mouth drop. All the songs are pure american metal masterpieces, [...]
B00008OWZC|5.0|I was a little worried when I saw the times for Dazed and Confused(25:25) and Whole Lotta Love(23:08).  I thought, 'uh oh, it's The Some Remains the Same soundtrack all over again.'  I couldn't have been further from the truth.  They have an energy that was definitly missing from the SRTS soundtrack.  The accoustic set on disk 1 is amazing.  Plus, the live version of the then unreleased Over the Hills and Far Away, is alone worth the price.    <br />If you're looking for the &quot;live Zeppelin&quot; that the people that actually saw them live always talk about, it's this CD.  Buy this and the BBC sessions Zep and let's pretend The Song Remains the Same Soundtrack never happened.  <br />Now let's all pray that Page, Plant, and Jones can actually get along long enough for a reunion tour for all of us Zep fans who never got to see them.  (and yes, an older Led Zeppelin IS better than nothing)
B000002UJQ|5.0|I like purple crayons.<br />I like Radiohead too.<br />So you should check them out and buy this CD
B00007ELKO|3.0|This film is of course most appealing to fans of early 80's indie music.  The film has the that \\"sex, drugs, and rockin-roll\\" approach to it and presents these aspects of the music scene and clubs which is quite prevelant among fans and musicians of many types of music.  Thus, a commonality that many can relate to, even if not a fan of the type of music the film is about. And, hey, ths is what these people did, partied and and made records, thus the name--\\"24 hour...\\" Like many musicians, some of them had their ups and downs with drugs and alcohol too.  (Also, if you liked \\"Trainspotting\\", you'll like this film--it has the same feel as others have said too.) Namely, Factory records label artists, Joy Divison, New Order, Happy Mondays, Durutti Column,(hey what about Section 25?), A Certain Ratio, etc. are the subject of the film.  <br />I liked the voice over documentary style of the movie and having Steve Coogan as Tony Wilson was brillant--that made the movie.  As he stated in the film, it was made about the music.  However, I was left wanting more music and more scenes with the bands to give more of a feel of their part in it all.  I liked the Joy Divison scenes and that was so subtely done, even Ian Curtis' suicide scene--here was more story that could have been done here leading up to it, but the JD fans know the story.  Likewise, I'm parial to New Order and wanted to see more of their influence and presence in the movie and music.  It seems the Happy Mondays got the most attention in the film and even left the impression that they were Factory's and Tony Wilson's favorate group  (but not the favorate Factory artist of the fans I don't think--but hey this label wasn't about popularity.)  Still JD/New Order put Factory on the map, so I'd thought we see more of them.  <br />Another thing, as a couple of previous reviewers have mentioned,this film is hard to follow.  I mean it seems to flow well, but things aren't explained much--maybe its better that way--but thenyou have to be a fan and know the history to really understand ansd enjoy it fully. It is never really clear what year it is in the film, except at the beginning and then at key scenes, like Ian Curtis'and Martin Hannett's deaths if you know when that was (the film doesn't reveal this.)  The rest of the time it just moves through a series of scenes without any sense of time. In addition, not trying to be a complainer, but I wish the on screen text bubbles, like the names of bands, etc. that pop up through the movie, were more clear--couldn't hardly read what they said--this obviously is a technical detail.<br />Hey, all in all, and blah, blah, blah, this was an entertaining film for music lovers, esp. of these fore mentioned bands.  I viewed the VHS, but not yet the DVD, but would just to see the extra goodies included, being a big fan of these bands I grew up with in high schhool, although me in the U.S. and they in England.  Glad their music first found its way over here to the more progressive record shops and radio stations at the time.  If only this record company, club, and bands could have lasted longer... but I think many will remember and remain fans. Perhaps, if anything, like the song, New Order is \\"Here to Stay.\\"
B00008PX8P|5.0|You will find yourself staring in amazement for hours on end watching this awesome DVD.
B00002Z88D|1.0|What in the name of all that's holy were they thinking? This is an embarassment. This is Spinal Tap. I suppose it's one of those \\"Seemed like a good idea at the time\\" things. I'm truly shocked to see so much positive feedback about this joke of a record. There really is no accounting for taste. It was good to see Hetfield look a little sheepish and embarassed when talking about this album recently.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin is one of the greatest bands of all time and this is their best album. Some people will tell you its Zeppelin 1 but its not!<br />-Whole Lotta Love, My personal favorite Zep song its every thing I want in a song great riff, bass, drumming and vocals, words cant describe what this song means to me, oh and the solos not bad either! 5/5<br />-What Is And What Should Never Be, I used to not like this song but it grows on you it has awsome slide guitar work from Jimmy page and Robert Plant sounds wild on this track 3/5<br />-The Lemon Song, This epic of a song has amazing solos in it and I love the lyrics, I personaly think this song should be called the \\"Killing Floor\\" just listen and you'll know why 4/5<br />-Thank You, is an amazing balled no special  guitar or duming from the boys here just Roberts great voice and some great lyrics 5/5<br />-HeartBraker, This is Jimmy Page at his best I dont care what people say this is his best solo, yes even better then \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and it has one of his best riffs ever! John Paul Johnes' bass is awsome and Bonzo's drumming is over the top! 5/5<br />-Living Loving Maid, is the shorest track on the album but not the weakest by any means this is a straight forward Rock song all the way! 5/5<br />-Ramble On, has in my openion the bands best lyrics besides \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" it has a great slide riff and once again its one of Roberts best Vocal performances 5/5<br />-Moby Dick, Probly the greatest instrumental ever! Pages riffs and solo is awsome, John Paul Jones' bass is out of this world, and John Bonhams Drum solo is nothing short of amazing!  5/5<br />-Bring It On Home, a slow song that does not get good until 1:35 or so and when it picks up it offers one of Jimmy Pages greatest riffs ever, and Robert Plant uses his vocals to the max on this track! 4/5
0385503954|5.0|I found the start of each section slow; however, the author would slowly drag me in, until I found that I couldn't put the book down. I was disappointed each time the action shifted, thinking that the current section couldn't be as good as the previous. And yet each ended being more powerful than the last. I'd prefer not to give too many details - much of the pleasure of this book comes from not knowing quite what the author is up to.
B000075BFK|2.0|To tell you the truth, this should have been a great 2pac album. Pac's lyrics are always on par and very heartfelt, it's just that the production on this is horrible. If it was recorded pre-96, The music should sound pre-96, not this club-commercial garbage. The producers of this album were obviously too concerned with making it as marketable as possible, and not true to it's original form. The only track that I can see that hasn't been remixed from it's original version is &quot;They dont give a F about us&quot;, which, IMO, just happens to also be the best track on both discs. It's hard, It's dark, it's nine-six, and sounds the way that it should sound. If you want to hear 2pac the way he should be heard, save yourself a headache and get the bootleg versions of these songs. This is the most horribly disfigured album yet.
B000092ZYX|5.0|After the amazing-but-difficult Kid A/Amnesiac albums, fans were wondering would they go back to their original sound and finally make a record with guitars. Well you can say they found them here. In fact that could be their other album title for this \\"We Found Our Guitars\\". It's finally nice to hear a Radiohead record and learn it on guitar rather than going through keyboards and synthesizers.<br />2+2=5: Starts with some scratchy sounds then a drum machine kicks in with a nice clean guitar part. After awhile the song just explodes. Best opener in awhile. 9/10<br />Sit Down, Stand Up: Again with the electronics! but they add to the song creating a nice atmosphere. Not a lot lyrically and if you really wanna have fun with this, count how many times Thom sings \\"the raindrops\\" at the end. Great song on headphones, lots of stuff piled on here. 8/10<br />Sail to the Moon: an absolutely beautiful song, like an updated Street Spirit or Pyramid Song. Mainly piano with some nice guitar arpeggios added for nice texture. One of the, if not the best on here. 10/10<br />Backdrifts: We're back to the electronics on a song that could've easily fit on Amnesiac. Is this song bad? Well, not really. Could've made a nice b-side but an average listen. 7/10<br />Go to Sleep: The next single. Rock with acoustics done even better than Coldplay. You can't help but sing along when he goes \\"over my dead body\\". While not gonna become the classic status we hold Fake Plastic Trees or Karma Police, still a standout. 9/10<br />Where I End and You Begin: Mainly bass and drum based with what sounds like moaning sounds in the background. Picks up when the guitar comes in. Another good song. Warning: the ending \\"I will eat you alive/There will be no more lies\\" can become catchy. 8/10<br />We Suck Young Blood: Here's where the album takes a little detour. Piano driven with handclaps(?!) during the beginning. Not that this is a bad song it's just another b-side contender. 7/10<br />The Gloaming: the alternate title for the record as well. This is a quite haunting song mainly electronic based with soothing vocals. One part even has what sounds like a ball bouncing. Quite a interesting listen. 8/10<br />There There: the first single and finally lots of guitars and tribal-like drums. Lyrically it's all over the place. Ends with some very chiming guitar arpeggiois at the end. 9/10<br />I Will: Nice little guitar based short song with 2 vocalists one classic Thom higher voice and the other being quite soft and deep. It's short but sweet. 8.5/10<br />Punch-Up at a Wedding: almost jazzy tempo but quite attack mode lyrics. An unexpected stand out for me, at first I didn't like it but it grows on you. 8/10<br />Mxyamatosis: Weird title for an aggressive song. The title comes from a disease that infected rabbits awhile ago. A VERY fuzzed out guitar line drives the song, made me recall the intro to Airbag. Not bad listen. 7.5/10<br />Scatterbrain: Drum machine and guitar, nothing that new but Thom sings quite beautifully on parts. Very high pitched guitar thrown in for good measure. 8.5/10<br />A Wolf at the Door: Good luck trying to sing along with this, it's very fastly sung. Not the best way to close the album but that's just me. 7/10<br />Despite some songs dragging down, there's some very choice songs on this and should be checked out.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I'm a fan of Radiohead, the first time i heard it was &quot;Creep&quot;, i thought they couldn't do better, i started hearing some of them, then i heard that they were making this new album, i was inpatient to hear it, is a really good buy if you like their style, as every good album you have to listen to it a few times till you really get their feeling, wich is quite well shown. A really good buy.
B00006879E|5.0|i found this cd by accident several months ago and haven't stopped listening to it yet.  the popularity of this group is spreading like a wildfire all over my college campus.  they're completely unlike any group i've ever heard before, and to even compare them to another artist is to do them injustice.  i'm seeing them in concert tomorrow night--it may be the highlight of my summer!
B00008PC2O|5.0|Well this is the 3rd T2 I have purchased and it is even better than the last one.  The entire movie has been remastered in HD with every frame reviewed by THX and others.  The sound is incredible and is 24 bit 5.1EX.  The picture is even better than the new Charlie's Angles SuperBit DVD.  This is a great video to get especially if you have a HDTV.  I am just getting ready to watch it again on my PC in High Definition on disc 2.<br />Highly recommended!!!
B000063UR2|5.0|I have a review many pages back already but I thought it was important to note this as many folks seem purplexed by the difference in the two versions of the film and how some scenes from the original US release are missing or different.<br />The edit is NOT a new edit it isn't even the same edit as the original European release. What we have here is an actual honest to goodness, found original edit of the film. It was discovered and decided that it was better than doing a new directors cut.<br />So what you are seeing is in fact one of the first versions of this film, before any of the &quot;Suits&quot; got a hold of it!<br />This also explains why some scenes are similar but different too and why some scenes like the Unicorn horn scene from the end of the US version are not in this cut.<br />Just thought you'd all want to know this.<br />Excellent excellent film.....
B000092ZYX|5.0|I had anticapated the release of Hail to the Theif for about a year. It was well worth the wait. I would recommend this cd to any radiohead fan. Some of the songs have almost a &quot;techno&quot; sound to them. I enjoy all of tracks on this cd!
6301763041|5.0|Ive seen this movie at least 3 times! It's a great, well done movie based upon the differences between 'drapes'(bad boys and girls) and goodie goods in the 1950's. Johnny Depp gives a great(and good looking!) performance along with the rest of the crew.<BR>If you watch this movie, you'll be satisfied and want to watch it over and over. I'll be honest, you won't be changed or moved by the movie, but no doubt you'll have alot of laughs.
B00005JLK1|4.0|\\"Ghost Ship\\" starts off wonderfully, with the brilliant opening credits and intriguing first scene. Things quickly go downhill from there as it piles on cliche after cliche and disappoints with a cheesy and predictable ending.<br />\\"Ghost Ship\\" recycles all the usual haunted house material, but because it's about a haunted ocean liner, it very nearly redeems itself. Yes, doors open by themselves to reveal hanging corpses. Yes, there's a glimpse of a character who shouldn't be there. Yes, there's a cigarette burning in an ashtray that hasn't been used in 40 years. And yes, there's a struggle between greed and prudence as the dangers pile up. These are all usual elements in haunted house movies, but here they take place aboard the deserted--or seemingly deserted--hulk of the Antonia Graza, an Italian luxury liner that disappeared without a trace during a 1962 cruise to America and has now been discovered 40 years later, floating in the Bering Strait. <br />A salvage crew led by Gabriel Byrne and Julianna Margulies sets out to capture this trophy, which could be worth a fortune. They are told about the ship by Ferriman (Desmond Harrington), a weather spotter for the Royal Canadian Air Force. He managed to capture some photos of it, and tips them off in<BR>return for a finder's fee. On board the salvage tug are Murphy the skipper (Byrne), Epps the co-owner (Margulies), and crew members Greer (Isaiah Washington), Dodge (Ron Eldard), Munder (Karl Urban) and Santos (Alex Dimitriades). Under the time-honored code of horror movies, they will disappear in horrible ways in inverse proportion to their billing--although of course there's also the possibility they'll turn up again. <br />The most absorbing passages in the film involve their exploration of the deserted liner. The quality of the art direction and photography actually evoke some of the same creepy, haunting majesty of those documentaries about descents to the grave of the Titanic. There's more scariness because we know how the original passengers and crew members died (that opening scene has a grisly humor), and because the ship still seems haunted--not only by that sad-eyed little girl, but perhaps<BR>by others. <br />The film piles on the gore, but doesn't go for many shocks or scares. It takes almost an hour for the first crew member to die, but admittedly, tension slowly does build, leading up to that grisly moment. Style and atmosphere are definitely a plus here and for the most part, the film works well. Unfortunately, the creepiness and tension of the first hour is lost in what is a horrific final twenty minutes. The cheesy final scene is the icing on the cake, ruining an otherwise superior horror film.<br />Is it worth seeing? Depends. It breaks no new ground as horror movies go, but it does introduce an intriguing location, and it's well made technically. The promising start gave me such hope. Too bad it didn't reach its full potential. Overall, it's better than you expect but not as good as you<BR>hope.
B00008NG5V|3.0|Jack stunned the music world with his crisp and clean style that teams well with todays Ben Harper or yesturdays Tom Petty.  Three cords and we're off!  On and On was a nice attempt to continue that dream - but after a few songs, you start to realize that this is all too familar.  It is a good record - but nothing special./
B000083E79|5.0|There is no way the very best of Cher can be offered on one disc. Her five-decade career has truly been amazing and her triumphant comebacks are always anticipated. While this CD certainly contains a lot of the 'very best,' it is still missing a number of brilliant tracks that should have been included. Didn't anyone think a two-disk woud have been more appropriate for this timeless diva, who--along with Madonna--is the best of the best? <br />Thankfully \\"Dark Lady,\\" \\"Half-Breed,\\"  \\"Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves,\\" \\"If I Could Turn Back Time, \\" \\"Just Like Jesse James\\", \\"After All,\\" \\"Heart of Stone,\\" \\"And the Beat Goes On,\\" and of course, \\"I Got You Babe\\" are all included here.<br />Tracks that should have been included are \\"You Better Sit Down Kids\\"; \\"Where Do You Go\\"; \\"Alfie\\"; \\"Living in a House Divided\\"; \\"The Way of Love\\"; \\"All I Ever Need Is You\\"; \\"A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done\\"; \\"Train of Thought\\"; \\"We All Sleep Alone\\"; and \\"Love and Understanding,\\" plus a few more, which would have made for a terrific second disk. I'm sure every fan wouldn't have minded paying more for that.<br />Rodney Jerkin's remix of \\"Different Kind of Love Song\\" is inferior to the original album version, which should have been included but unfortunately is not. However, \\"The Very Best of Cher\\" gets bonus points for including the phenomenal track \\"All Or Nothing,\\" from the \\"Believe\\" album, an underrated and overlooked flop single that's just as good as \\"Believe,\\" if not better.  This CD makes for an addicting guilty pleasure from one of the most fabulous female entertainers around. <br />Her newer fans should definitely pick this up. It is still a pretty good representation of her songs from the 60's to today. The range of music is pretty fantastic, and only Cher can carry it off. Her voice is distinctive and amazing, able to carry all types of beats-- from folk, pop, disco, rock, country, and house. The queen continues to reign. Let the beat go on!
B0000024TT|5.0|And I don't use that work very often when describing albums.  In fact, I feel as though the word &quot;masterpiece&quot; is thrown around too often and too loosely by many reviewers, but the word unquestionably applies to Cohen's debut album.<br />&quot;Suzanne,&quot; &quot;So Long Marianne&quot; and &quot;Hey Thats No Way to Say Goodbye&quot; are songs you may or may not know with singalong choruses and beautiful imagery.  <br />&quot;The Master Song,&quot; &quot;The Stranger Song,&quot; &quot;Stories of the Street&quot; and &quot;One of Us Cannot be Wrong&quot; are intense lyrical works.  &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Stranger&quot; might be the highlights of the album for me.  Cohen effortlessly speaks of weird, scary, romantic visions of the isolation and pain of being alone or aloof, with some moments of ecstatic joy thrown in every now and then.<br />&quot;Teachers&quot; blends a vicious Spanish-based lead guitar with a speedy rhythm riff and a vocal by Cohen that sounds scary and deeply unsettling at times.<br />For those who haven't heard this, you're missing out on a staggering work of lyrical and musical excellence.  Cohen himself could never match this effort, even 30 years later.
0380778556|5.0|\\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again...\\"<br />With that opening sentence, Rebecca offers an addicting and engrossing journey into the mind of our unnamed heroine, slowly tortured by her new marriage to Maxim DeWinter, a man twice her age, and haunted by his dead first wife, Rebecca--whose body was never discovered. She finds herself living in Rebecca's shadow and haunted by the mystery of the woman's death. She is and always will be the SECOND Mrs. DeWinter, something the sinister housekeeper, Ms. Danvers, will not let her forget.<br />Rebecca is a novel of mystery and passion, a deliciously dark psychological tale with a brooding atmosphere and unbearable tension. Daphne DuMaurier has crafted an exceptional masterpiece of romantic suspense, one of the best books of the 20th century and possibly the best book in the romantic suspense genre.  Highly Recommended!!!
B000092ZYY|5.0|Radiohead's highly anticipated new release, &quot;Hail To The Thief,&quot; is a record that's bound to satisfy all old Radiohead fans and classic shoegazers.  There's a certain feel to the CD as you glide through it, as you hear the dissonant, brooding guitars of &quot;OK Computer&quot; as well as the mind-bending synth and ProTools editing from &quot;Amnesiac.&quot;  However, if you're looking for a throwback to the good-old days of &quot;The Bends,&quot; you've probably come to the wrong place.  My first Radiohead record was &quot;Kid A,&quot; and although that was not a great place to start in Radiohead's catalog, I've come to appreciate all of the music they've done quite easily.  It could be said that &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot; is too long and not as well focused as Radiohead's previous records, but I disagree, because the band produced it, and this is obviously where they want to go with their music.  Some of the highlights are the thumping 7/8 time of &quot;2+2=5,&quot; the smooth guitar hook driven &quot;There There,&quot; and the bombastic &quot;Myxamatosis.&quot;  &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot; has extremely complex, progressive arrangements that may leave your head spinning the first listen around, but I'm positive that you'll come to enjoy it after a few listens.  Great albums take a long time to become great, and this one definetly has potential.  (I highly reccomend this special limited edition, it's like no other CD jacket I've ever seen before...)
B00005NNU4|5.0|It has been years since a CD has come out and blown me away like this! Sananda (TTD) has written some of his best songs on this recording. I can't put it down. The songs have got great grooves and the lyrics are a combination of spiritual and sexy. The music and cool vibe are contagious. I saw him live at First Avenue on the Vibrator tour and was totally amazed at the great energy that he radiates! This is a fantasic album. Also make sure to see him on tour. It is a rare treat!
B0000017CA|5.0|I said Sammy did &quot;most&quot; of the hardcore vocals... I meant to say &quot;a lot&quot;... oops... heh heh.
B00008LDPU|3.0|The Animatrix was a film of extremes. From the most advanced in animation (&quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot;) to the most primitive (&quot;World Record&quot;), from complete ingenuity (&quot;Matriculated&quot;) to manipulative idiocy (both &quot;Second Renaissance&quot; segments). Yet you can still some up the whole thing in one word: BLEAK.<br />Props to the various animators for creating an interesting variety of features. From the sketchy, amoeba-like characters in &quot;Kid's Story&quot; to the picture perfect CGI of &quot;Final Flight,&quot; the film has certainly utilized the strengths of a superior tangent of animators. 2/3 of the segments are very similar in style to such anime classics as &quot;Ghost in the Shell,&quot; &quot;Metropolis,&quot; and &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; (duh), while a third are uncategorizable.<br />As for story. Most of these are just eye candy with LOTS of pseudo-scientific dialogue to make people think their brain cells AREN'T being destroyed by the thousands. At least 2/9 of the film got it right.<br />The first is in &quot;Kid's Story.&quot; Using a unique animation style, the segment lets the imagery speak for itself. It chronicles the plight of a confused boy, who thinks life is more real when he dreams than when awake. It ends with a bit which &quot;Reloaded&quot; hints at. The Second is &quot;Matriculated&quot; (which, ironically enough, has the most eye candy of the lot). The story, involving freed humans' desire to convert a machine to their side, is thought provoking and ultimately tragic. Both segments follow a refreshing pattern: Replacing pretentious narratives and stupid dialogue for pure spectacle.<br />All in all, worth seeing. Cool soundtrack.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Although Radiohead ditches the riffs and guitar rock of pablo honey, and the bends, they still manage to pull off a great cd. Textured rock is used in this, as was in Ok Computer, which is why I rate this as being good; Ok Computer being my favorite. For all the people disliking the sound of the new Radiohead, you can listen to another band.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril lavigne is one of the most talented artists of today. She writes and plays her own music. This is the kind of CD I would play with my parents around. Its pretty clean. Also, the songs are something everyone can relate to. Avril Rocks!!! Buy her CD, and you'll LOVE it.
B000089RVX|5.0|I rate this cd 5 stars, I really like their music, what they sing about and the rhythm is great. Their music is for cause and I like their music. RATINGS FOR THE SONGS: <BR>      1.

0671027344|5.0|this book is amazing... there are no words to describe how much i enjoyed it. I read a few pages and the next thing I know im finished with it. I really enjoyed this book because Charlie isnt perfect. He has some problems. Im not the one 2 cry but this book brought tears to my eyes when I read the thing with mary-elizabeth,sam and charlie (truth or dare) A MUST READ BOOK, but make sure you are mature enough to handle the adult themes.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I think this is the best album in the world for 3 reasons.<BR>1. 53 million people worldwide brought this album.<BR>2. This album also won 8 grammy awards.<BR>3. Because all the songs on this album are fantastic!<br />I would strongly recommend this to anyone even if your not a Michael Jackson fan you should still buy this album because its fantastic!
B00005ATQM|1.0|This is the worst DVD-Audio sound I've ever experienced.<br />Better stick to the Stereo CD.
B00005JL3A|4.0|This movie is part of the famous Resident Evil video game franchise and is a side story for what is occurring in the games. The special forces in this film are not S.T.A.R.S. They are actually working for Umbrella corporation. The contamination in the game series occurs several months before S.T.A.R.S. team Bravo is sent in to investigate. <br />Umbrella tried to cover the accident up with its own special unit and the R.P.D. (Racoon city's police department) were in charge of the murders occuring a few months later outside the mansion. When the R.P.D. lost control the S.T.A.R.S. were called in to investigate which led to the first game. Bravo team had problems when they arrived at the woods outside the mansion in the movie. Only a few made it to the mansion. Alpha team was sent in to rescue them but they were attacked and the chopper pilot, Brad Vickers, fearfully took off without them. <br />The remaining Alpha members made it to the mansion and so Resident Evil the game started. Resident Evil Zero, the game, shows what happened to the Bravo team. <br />So if your expecting the movie to be the first game then your going to be disappointed. But remember it was never billed as being a movie based off the first game, instead it was billed as being a part of the franchise. This is what happened to the members of Umbrellas special unit. Several months after the events in the movie, the game begins. <br />The movie is very well done. It isn't a gore fest, so it doesn't seem over the top. It is well directed and the special effects are very good. If you like zombie movies, or the game series then you should like this movie very much. That is unless you expect this to be the first game in movie form. Think outside your shallow viewpoint and your sure to enjoy a little side story you probably will never see in the game franchise.
B0000797IO|4.0|I believe this film is so much more deserving than its negative reviews posted on this site.  Surprisingly, some have described it as being boring and pointless.  Perhaps the movie IS boring in a way, but this was only done to portray the dull, lower middle-class lifestyle that the wife (Jennifer Aniston) has lived out each and every day. She gets to a point where she begins to question whether she's taken the right path in her life and whether she wants to continue it or to  start a new one. That is the entire focus of the film, and there are certainly a lot of people who could relate to this premise.<br />The cast is very good, but the actor I specifically want to mention is Tim Blake Nelson, who plays the husband's idiot friend, Bubba. He's such a riot! You will immediately recognize this guy from OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? when he escaped from the chain gang with George Clooney. He seems to play the exact same person in this movie, but man, he plays it with such hillbilly-ish perfection!
B0000636UN|5.0|First of all, lets be real... Sheryl Crow rocks like no other female out there. Sheryl Crow writes the best songs like no other. And lastly, Sheryl Crow is a true legend who will earn MORE respected for what she has done, once she is gone (which is sad). People talked alot of mess about this album, but they neglect one fact. That this album is 10 times better than most albums that was released 2001-2002. I must admit this is not my favorite album by her and she took a more bouncy approach. SO WHAT?!!! Do we expect this woman to be depress ALL the time? People trip me out, when \\"serious\\" artists decide to have some fun with their music and they don't like it.<br />1. Steve McQueen- a song about the lost of the American spirit.  <BR>2. Soak Up The Sun- a happy summer song.  <BR>3. You're An Original- her and Lenny K. voices sound great together.  <BR>4. Diamond Road- very 70's rock tune.  <BR>5. It's So Easy- a song with Don Henley about being in love with a married man. <BR>6. C'Mon, C'Mon- she really sing on this one.        <BR>7. Safe & Sound- a touching song to a late friend.       <BR>8. Over You- really like this one.        <BR>9. Hole In My Pocket-very southern-rockish.       <BR>10. Abilene- more country than anything that Shania has ever put out.        <BR>11. Lucky Kid- its ok. Rumored to be about Kid Rock.        <BR>12. It's Only Love- my second favorite song. Great lyrics.       <BR>13. Weather Channel- the best song on the album. SHe really moves me on this one.
6305922756|5.0|Good God if you haven't already seen this movie PLEASE view it as soon as possible. One of the funniest movies ever, if not THE funniest movie...
B000092ZYX|5.0|My word, this album is great. I am an avid radiohead fan, i admit, so that may slight my review a bit. Radiohead keeps remaking themselves for the better. my initial feeling on HTTT is that it is another radiohead masterpiece.
0066620996|4.0|Collins begins with a fascinating premise:  identify those companies that underwent a long-term shift from mediocre/good performance to market-beating great performance, and attempt to explain what they did differently than other companies in the same businesses that did not make the same transition.  Thanks to the success of his previous book, \\"Built to Last\\", Collins was able to assemble a large team of B-school students to do the grunt work, while he could concentrate on organizing the findings and summarizing them in this book.<br />Collins presents his findings in the chronological order of the steps he feels must be taken to transition from good to great.  All in all, his findings will make sense to any student of Peter Drucker's, and they mostly ring true with my own 20 years of experience in the world of business.  Collins advocates a very straightforward, fad-avoiding, \\"stick to your knitting\\" approach to business, with an emphasis on rational thinking, consistent action, and substance over style.  So, the book presents a very strong case that these basic principles can, applied consistently over long periods of time, lead to major success (the good guys win in the end).<br />That said, I do feel that Collins overreaches a bit.  He preaches with the zeal of a true believer, at one point stating \\"Furthermore, if you ever stop doing any one of the key ideas, your organization will inevitably slide backward toward mediocrity.\\"  However, he occasionally bends the facts to fit his theories.  After heaping immense praise on Nucor's CEO Ken Iverson (Collins obviously shares Iverson's strict egalitarian philosophy of compensation), Collins explains Nucor's recent troubles by finding one person to claim that Iverson had actually degenerated as a leader.  Collins also rails against companies that stray outside their core businesses, but then concocts a questionable core business for the very successful yet highly diversified GE, claiming that its core business is theproduction of great General Managers to run businesses from aircraft engines to TV broadcasting.  But given the challenge of simplifying a very complex world, Collins can be forgiven these minor sins.<br />The book is an easy read for the busy executive, roughly 200 pages of narrative text divided into bite-sized 20 page chapters.  Collins communicates clearly and crisply, and sprinkles in illustrative anecdotes that occasionally tug on emotional heartstrings.  Some of his terminology (e.g. \\"Level 5 Leadership\\") will no doubt enter the American business lexicon just as BHAG (from \\"Built to Last\\") has, although I wish he had chosen a more serious term than \\"Hedgehog Concept\\".
B000092ZYY|4.0|Radiohead fans will not be disappointed. The boys deliver an incredibly unique feel as always, this time there is more electronica incorporated into their traditional alternative rock.<br />A diverse set of songs from surreal to spine-tingling. Bottom line, this is a decent album worth getting.
037571412X|5.0|Roth fans, students of serious literature, and those interested in a glimpse into the aging male psyche should truly enjoy this gem of a book.  Roth proves his stature as one of America's greatest living writers by, in the mere span of roughly 150 large-type pages, offering insights into subjects such as man's intellectual nature versus man's sexual nature, Puritanism, academia and political correctness, the Sixties, marriage and family, mortality, and the randomness of fate.  One could go on and on describing the many attributes of this book, but in the spirit of Roth's pithiness, I will just say: \\"read it!\\"
B00008DDHZ|5.0|Bloody Sunday is a well filmed show that brings to light of one of the most tragic events in Irish history. On a peaceful cival rights march, the British first opened fire on the Irish march, and were given permission to fire at will. Any one who is Irish, and knows exactly what happened on that faitful day, can now get an up close and real feel of what it was like to face the British para's, while peacfully marching for equal rights, in a land whose boundries were gerrymandered by the British. The movie is very acurate, showing that the British first shot on the defensless Irish. Years later the British government investigated the events of that day, called the Stalker Report. Once the investigation was finished, the British refused to release the results of that investigation. This movie, is not one sided. It accurately portrays the events of that day, showing that the Irish were repressed of their due rights, by an invading, colonial government.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is going to be very short.<BR>Simply run and get this record.<BR>In the 14 new songs featuring here Radiohead had mixed all thier previous styles, and also created a whole new sound concept. Nigel Godrich sure is responsible to a great deal of this album's perfection.<BR>Thom's Voice is better than ever, more exciting and heartfelt,<BR>Instruments also sound very different, especially the Drums and the piano. <br />Radiohead has done it again !!!
B00004RF83|5.0|This is one of the great Cold War movies made during the '50's and '60's, and, like Fail Safe and Dr. Strangelove, it does an excellent job of showing how screwed up the anti-communist mindset became during those years.
0790730960|5.0|I have loved batman and this movie since I was four. And when asked what my favorite movie is, I always come back to this one. Maybe its the music, maybe it the great casting, maybe its fantastic directing, it maybe all three! One thing I know, its that this movie has been at the top of my list since as long as I can remember. Please, please, please get this one. It's a keeper and you will not be disappointed.
B00005JKZV|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie. I love the first one, and I love the books. But one of the reasons the first movie was so good was because it followed the book so well, while still eliminating unnecessary parts and with few additions. It's hard to believe the second and first movies were made at the same time. Two Towers has pretty much the whole story rewritten! And the saying, \\"If it's not broken don't fix it\\" holds true. the movie becomes boring, with repetitive and pointless action sequences that were apparently added for the purpose of making it more engaging. Peter Jackson really likes the fake death sequences, unfortunately who can only have so many of those without destroying the fantasy created for the audience. I just hope Return of the King gets justice.
0061020680|5.0|Book 4 of the Discworld series.<br />After hearing so many great things about Discworld and having read the first three novels in the series, I was not quite as impressed as I had hoped to be with this series.  When I starting reading Mort, this all changed.  Having only read four Discworld books, Mort is by far the best of the first four books.<br />The focus of the Discworld series shifts to different characters in each book.  This time the focus is on a young man named Mort (hence the title).  Mort is an awkward young man with no interest in the family craft.  His father decides to hire Mort out as an apprentice.  So, Mort stands in the village square as all the other young men are chosen, but Mort is left standing.  He waits until midnight (the end of the choosing) and just as the bell tolls midnight, a rider appears.  Mort is chosen to be an apprentice.  Death himself takes Mort as an apprentice.  Death is a major recurring character throughout the series, and HE ALWAYS SPEAKS IN CAPITAL LETTERS.<br />Mort begins to learn the craft of the Reaper, but Mort manages to cause a major problem in reality when someone who is supposed to die does not die (Mort's fault, naturally).  This is the most interesting of the first 4 Discworld novels, and since the series doesn't appear to follow any sort of important chronology (for the most part), Mort may be one of the better books to begin the series with.  While I've been working my way through the series, I haven't had a lot of interest in each subsequent book....until now.  Mort has me interested in reading more Discworld novels.
0425170349|3.0|Great read and easy to get into, but the whole concept is kind of hoaky.  I like Clancy's stuff and as typical in with his other books the attention to detail is excellent.  Overlook the hoaky plot, the book is not a bad read.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This is a stunning portrait of how one Polish Jew survived the Nazi Holocaust.  This is the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), a concert pianist living in Warsaw.  This movie was directed by Roman Polanski (Chinatown).<br />The film opens in Warsaw before any Jews had been put into the ghettos.  Szpilman was playing the piano for Warsaw radio.  A bomb is heard in the distance.  He keeps playing.  Another bomb hits, but closer.  He is still playing.  When a bomb finally blows in the windows and knocks Szpilman across the room, he is forced to acknowledge what is going on.  He is cut, but unhurt.  He returns home to learn that the Nazis require that all Jews in Warsaw must relocate to a ghetto.  After some arguing, the family relocates to the Warsaw Ghetto.<br />This is a movie about the survival of one man during one of the most important and terrible times of the twentieth century.  The film never loses the focus of keeping the camera on Szpilman.  There is so much more going on than what we see on screen, but in the context of the film, those other things are not important.  This is a singular story and it is beautiful and haunting.  There are moments of absolute beauty and wonder, and there are moments that are excruciating to watch.  We know this is a true story, based on a memoir by Szpilman, but we don't know the details of his experience.  The Pianist is a masterpiece by Roman Polanski and it rightfully deserved all of the accolades that it received.
B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti is rock music nirvana, and should rank among the top ten greatest ROCK albums of all time. While Led Zeppelin II and the eponymous fourth album may be better loved, PG is their masterpiece with its mix of ear-punching blues-rock, folk stylings and straight-ahead rock'n'roll.  <br />Stand-outs: Disc One - the entire set displays the band at its fiercest & bluesiest since LZ II. Personal favourites: The Rover, In My Time of Dying, Trampled Under Foot and Kashmir.<br />Disc Two - The folk instrumental \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\", Fats Domino-styled jump-blues of \\"Boogie With Stu\\", classic Zeppelin blues-rock of \\"Night Flight\\", \\"The Wanton Song\\", \\"Black Country Woman\\" and \\"Sick Again\\", and the poignant \\"Ten Years Gone\\".<br />5 stars.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Aah, the return of Radiohead; eagerly anticipated, every new CD of theirs raises the bar of anticipation that much further. &quot;Thief&quot; is being called a return to their roots, back to the days of the &quot;Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; and in a way, it is. If we're talking about the energy in the songs, they are there in spades. While most of the songs on &quot;Kid A&quot; were like expansive glaciers, content in unfolding in the highest dramatic form, on &quot;Thief&quot; the glaciers have melted. Mostly. There are still electronically treated instruments on here, but they add to the overall mood and tempo of the album - while longer than their previous efforts, it goes by faster.<BR>With a title lifted from a book about the questionable presidential election in 2000, you'd expect Thom Yorke's lyrics to be very focused. Thankfully, his subject matter is not so topical, infusing a fear for his children in his dystopian worldview and mistrust.<BR>So does &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; hold up to Radiohead's past masterpieces? Well, of course it is too early to tell. Upon first listen, the album lacks the intense focus that set apart &quot;OKC&quot; and &quot;Kid A&quot; in their own stratosphere, sounding more like a collection of strong songs than a solid complete album. It is a great album, somewhere in between those two albums. It would be selfish to think that Radiohead could change the face of rock or travel a newly found path with every new album, and to proclaim this album no leap forward is missing the point. Radiohead, in the future, will be shown to have found their sound with &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; and from here on out, everything they make will be distinctly Radiohead. Unless of course they completely take us off guard, which they are proven to be capable of.<BR>Get this album if you enjoy smart, challenging music that doesn't cater to the &quot;pop radio&quot; crowd; you will not regret it.
B00007L4MJ|4.0|The original \\"Metropolis\\" as conceived by Fritz Lang in 1926 is, regrettably, lost. The wholesale gutting by Channing Pollock of the original in the US and the UFA (in Germany) hatchet job of 1927 have ensured that the most ambitious German film of the 1920s (and the most expensive) is lost. The Kino version is the most comprehensive reconstruction possible with existing resources, without resort to the use of stills as Giorgio Moroder did in his mid 1980s iteration. Kino is to be congratulated in reviving the original score and including a feature of rare stills and explanatory notes to the DVD.<br />A couple of observations first, the quality of the film is excellent thanks to an assiduous remastering. Sound is good for the score (it is a silent movie after all), titles are the originals as printed, and the whole effort has been to recreate authentically a truncated masterpiece. I've seen a number of different prints of the film over the last twenty years, but the quality of this presentation is unbeaten. The only negatives are the scanty biographies of the principals, which any devotee would dismiss as insubstantial, and the failure to use some of the stills Moroder used back in 1986. There is at least one tracking shot in the Moroder colourised version, of the Hel sculpture (and that is spelt \\"Hel\\"), which has been left out of the Kino disk.It can be argued that using stills would only detract from the objective of re-creating as fully as possible the \\"moving picture\\" of Metropolis. A more fulsome extract of the original plot at the end would have been appreciated. There are a number of out of print books (by Ace SF and Lorrimer Classic Film Scripts) including the screenplay and the novelisation which could have been used for an explanatory synopsis.<br />These are minor misgivings, the disk recaptures the wonder of the original as much as possible. It is unlikely that any devotee could acquire a better record of this relic of the silent era. I can heartily recommend it, and hope all viewers experience the enjoyment I felt as a teenager going to a midnight showing in a seedy part of town of the renowned \\"Metropolis\\"...
B000092ZYX|5.0|Before Radioheads last album \\"Amnesiac\\" was released it was rumored that it was the return of Radiohead's earlier more 'rockish' days. Once released those rumors were obviously proven wrong. This time around it was rumored \\"Hail To The Thief\\" was to be Radiohead's (long awaited) ''OK Computer 2''. Despite what Thom Yorke has said, that is also obviously wrong. \\"The Bends\\", and \\"OK Computer\\" have always been Radiohead's albums closest to reaching a happy-medium between the experimental \\"Kid A.\\", and \\"Amnesiac\\", and the more generic guitar rock of \\"Pablo Honey\\". I don't think Radiohead was ever meant to be Experimental Electronica, or grungey guitar-rock. After listening to \\"Hail To The Thief\\" I get the idea that this is what Radiohead was always trying to do in the first place since the release of \\"The Bends\\".<br />By its release it seems everyone had already heard 'Hail To The Thief' one way or another whether it was the unfinished version as producer Nigel Godrich says, or not. Of course as Joshua Ellison of Junkmedia.org said ''Listening to an unmastered or MP3 version of a Radiohead record is like looking at a xerox of a Jackson Pollock.''.<br /> \\"Hail To The Thief\\" contains a more even mix of songs then any of their other albums. It starts off with \\"2 + 2 = 5\\" (a reference to George Orwell's \\"1984\\") which best describes what the rest of the album is going to be. It continues with ''Sit Down. Stand Up'', and then on to ''Sail To The Moon'' which resembles Amnesiac's \\"Pyramid Song\\" both musically, and lyrically. After that the song \\"Backdrifs\\" takes you back to the electronica grounds that ''Kid A.'' covered with a very 'Idioteque'-esque song. After that the next most notable song is \\"We Suck Young Blood\\", its also in my opinion the best song on the album. It contains mostly a slow-moving piano, and off-beat clapping, then through-out the song its speeds up, and slows down. ''There There'' which is the albums current single, and possibly the second best song on the album gives drummer Phil Selway a chance to show off after ''The Gloaming'' which is another drum-machine based electronica song. The albums grand-finale \\"A Wolf at the Door\\" contains Thom Yorke rapping his lyrics - it comes out more of a ''Subterainian Homesick Blues''-like rapping rather than anything like todays rap. Its also probably the albums most stand-out song just as all Radiohead album-finishers are.<br /> In the end I would recommend \\"Hail To The Thief\\" to anyone who likes Radiohead's previous 5 albums. If you didn't like any of their post-OK Computer work this may change that. The albums feel is similar to that of OK Computer. Its not as dark as Kid A., or Amnesiac, but its darker than OK Computer, and The Bends. As Thom Yorke has said \\"Radiohead will be completely unrecognisable in two years. At least, I hope so. It's the only perspective of the future that I can live with.\\" - its easy to believe that if you look at Pablo Honey, and then look at Amnesiac. If Radiohead keeps progressing as they have its also easy to believe that it will keep getting better, and better.
B00006CXXU|4.0|The 22 year-old's newest CD is good, compared to her last CD, this one's gold.

0688163173|3.0|While Dennis Lehane's gorgeous MacKenzie/Gennaro series sparkles with humor and wit, both &quot;Mystic River&quot; and especially now &quot;Shutter Island&quot; are heavy on the darker side.<br />Dennis Lehane's latest novel is full of darkness, madness and a menacing atmosphere... the setting quite cleverly transports the reader in a Frankenstein-like atmosphere: a raging hurricane, old barracks walls, a desolate island, mysterious doctors and lunatic asylum inmates. Amongst that the troubled investigator plus his sidekick, wading through dread and horror.<br />Without wanting to give away too much, the shocking surprise ending is a clever twist, even though it does become foreseeable in the last fifty pages or so. Basically this is quite a brilliant book, except that I found the character development too shallow and one-dimensional. It could have been so much better had Mr. Lehane invested in one or two hundred more pages, to thicken the plot and give the novel more depth. Some of the side stories actually go nowhere or remain unexplained, at least that was my own shallow feeling after finishing the final pages - which was definitely not the case with &quot;Mystic Rivers&quot;.<br />Not bad, but with Dennis Lehane's proven writing skills it could've been even a lot better - that's why I'm only giving it three stars.

B000092ZYX|5.0|This is still an extraordinary album of Radiohead althought we all know the best of them is &quot;Bends&quot;.  Indeed, we see thought this album as an explicit procession of Radiohead's music and they show the powerful evidence. They made it!

B000092ZYX|5.0|What can I say that you do not already know, because let's face it, you probably downloaded the albulm a month ago.  Still, you're going to buy it because it is the mastered version, it has really great artwork (especially the special edition), and it is a Radiohead release (with lyrics!).  High points:  2+2=5, Sail To The Moon, Go To Sleep, Where I End and You Begin, I Will, Myxomatosis, A Wolf At The Door.  There are no low points, just songs that bear repeated listens to &quot;get.&quot;  They are a sonic miracle, and I am happy to be able to experience their greatness once again.

B000092ZYY|5.0|the first half of 2003 has been relatively bleak when it comes to good, thoughtful music that is easily accessible. In come Radiohead with Hail to the Thief, an album boasting the return to guitar rock roots. What we get howver, is more of a hybridization of all the varying styles Radiohead has used musically, focused in a single direction. Instead of releasing a entropic and chaotic album culled from two years of recording, Radiohead surprise us by releasing a straightforward highway cruise that was reportedly recorded in about two weeks. <BR>The point of the album is well driven. Even the album title is nowhere near a vague metaphor for the listener to figure out. I am not saying that vague metaphors are a bad thing, they are something to be loved if one can unravel them, but this record needs to be direct. it needs to, and it is. The standout tracks for me are2+2=5, Sail to the Moon, Go To Sleep, There THere, I will, Myxomatosis and A wolf at the Door, though the album should be listened to in its entirety for full appreciation. the packaging for the limited edition is great, though my cd had a few little unaffecting scrapes in it. hopefully that isnt common. anyway, i hope an album comes out this year to top this, for that shall be a beautiful album indeed. but i'm still waiting...
B000092ZYX|4.0|It seems that after four years of vastly electronic experimentation, Radiohead has incorporated more of their rock influences into the Kid A and Amnesiac formula. I personally think that this is a great album, and a great expansion on the musical ideas expressed in the aforementioned efforts. Hail to the Thief is far more versatile, with song writing that rivals that of OK Computers. Not that I didn't like Kid A and Amnesiac, but they were just missing something that Computer had and that Thief has. Anyway, I suppose that's that.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead are easily one of the more influential bands to come out intact from the 1990s.  I'm sure everyone has heard of OK Computer, it had an amazing impact upon music as a whole, making the Top 5 of almost every 'greatest album ever' lists for years.<br />Kid A and Amnesiac followed, and while they were good, they didn't achieve the heights of OK Computer, being too full of experimental electronic music and lyrically rambling.  Good albums, but not as accessible as OK Computer.<br />Enter Hail to the Thief.  Not as experimental as the previous two, nor as ambitious as OK Computer, it lies comfortable between OK Computer and The Bends.  The album actually has guitars in it this time, which is definitely a welcome addition.  While it *does* occassionally suffer from a bit of Thom Yorke rambling, the album is a very good listen even the first time, but it has enough subtleties to keep you enthralled for weeks and months to come.
B000003TA4|5.0|When i first bought Nevermind i didn't really know what 2 exspect, id heard the song &quot;smells like teen spirit&quot; and of course i instantly loved it, the passion and angst in Kurt's voice was incredible and i knew instantly that i would have 2 buy the album. I listened 2 it over and over again, each time I slowly got more and more inspired by the catchy riffts and booming vocals of which is made through out the CD. Some of my favourite songs are &quot;something in the way, lithium, come as u are, polly and of course smells like teen spirit.&quot; I highly reccomend this CD TO any 1 that is remotly intrested in ROCK.I can guarante that you will wanna pick up a guitar and strum ure heart out with all of Kurts catchy pounding riffts of which are made through out NEVERMIND.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Don't misunderstand the meaning of this album, &quot;American Life&quot; is not about America, it's all about Madonna, she talks about life, love and family. Just hear &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, probably her most beautiful and sincere love song (the lyrics will touch your heart: &quot;I'm not religious but I feel so moved, makes me wanna pray, pray you'll always be here&quot;) and you'll understand why this album is so amazing, Madonna decided to be honest and you can love her or hate her but you can't ignore her. There are no fillers, you really need to listen to this album from the first to the last track, you won't like it the first time you'll hear it but it's gonna grow on you and you are gonna learn how to appreciate it. Buy it!
0671027344|5.0|I read this book my Freshman Year in College. I thought it was good then and I think it's good now. There's nothing revolutionary about the book but Chbosky writes with good intentions and it works. It's heartfelt without being sappy or melodramatic, funny but not pretentious about it. ...
B000002MUW|5.0|After the explicit &quot;Erotica&quot;, everybody thought Madonna's career was over but she came back with &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; to prove them wrong and reinvented herself again. With the help of Dallas Austin and Babyface, Madonna recorded a very classy and atmospheric R&amp;B album. I love R&amp;B/Hip-Hop and I usually dislike when Pop stars try to do that kind of music but I LOVE this album and it's my favourite Madonna album. Buy it.... you won't regret it.
B00005JLF5|4.0|I suppose most people looking at the box sets of materials are, for the most part, already fans, so let me start with the technical stuff: This is a quality transfer that will probably look and sound better on your TV than the original broadcasts of the show did in the '90s. The extras are a little weak, having clearly been culled from previous interviews with the cast, and also just as clearly intended to be spread out among the show's seven seasons. (Maybe they'll consolidate all the bits at the end; that would be nice.) The highlights of the extra material are the more extended interviews with the set and alien designers, as these are long enough to actually allow you to gain some insight into how things were done and what the priorities were.<br />The lowlights are the easter eggs hidden on the screens. You may enjoy these, but I absolutely =hate= this kind of nonsense. I'm not so entertainment deprived that I feel the need to pass the time wiggling the joystick around in the hopes of lighting up some hidden feature. This activity always works out the same: I try to hit all the extras, end up disappointed with the ones I do find (because they're really short), and because I can never get all of them, I'm just sure the ones I missed have the cool content. I'm convinced once the novelty of digital entertainment wears off these will go the way of the tediously long introduction menus. <br />Now, about the show: Well, it sure wouldn't get made today. A show centered on the activities and fate of a planet full of religious \\"terrorists\\", with said \\"terrorists\\" portrayed in mostly positive light? I don't think so. What made this first season work as well as it does is that the writers avoided taking the easy or obvious answers. And the acting, for the most part, is top flight. If the ensemble lacked a dramatic powerhouse like Patrick Stewart, they were unparalleled as a group--even when their characters were at odds. As did the supporting cast and guest stars, represented in the frist season by such greats as Wallace Shawn and Oscar(TM)-winner Louise Fletcher. (Siddig overplays an episode where he gets possessed by a malevolent alien, but he had, in many ways, the hardest role to play, especially in that first season where he's in danger of becoming DS9's \\"Wesley Crusher\\".)<br />I, personally, have never been a Star Trek Fan, neither Trekkie nor Trekker (nor clear on why one should be held in lower regard than the other) but by various accidents of birth and marriage and parenthood, seem to inevitably find myself associated with those who truly adore the franchise. Yet I never missed this show when it was on. Few shows have character development this good, and fewer still have such strongly character-driven plots.<br />But if memory serves, the first season was the weakest. What's interesting is that, upon reviewing it, the first season isn't all that weak. Episodes like \\"Duet\\" and \\"Dax\\" demonstrated early on that this was going to be a show about people (whatever rubbery face prosthetics they were wearing), and even if they hadn't quite hit their stride, they managed to stake a claim on the Star Trek(TM) universe that was unique and refreshing.

B00005JLRT|3.0|Star Trek: Nemesis is a well plotted film and the exposition is laid out carefully as though it were an old fashioned film.  However, as infuriating as it may be to Trek fans and filmgoers alike, it does manage to the impossible even as far as Star Trek is concerned.  It's scored brilliantly by Jerry Goldsmith, Star Trek's musical god, this does the film justice because the score makes it appear as though the entire film from beginning to end is larger than life and makes it partially accessible to children only in some scenes though.  Data's counterpart B4 as pointless as this plot device is, Brent Spiner's performance in scenes with himself and himself provide another point of reassurance that the film is not completely bad while not being the best.  The film's best plotline interwoven in the story is the film's sense of family.  The family is growing and therefore growing apart which in a way makes this an acceptible swan song for the Next Generation crew.  The digital aspects of the film deliver and deliver well.  The film's true problem is the longevity of the Trek franchise, it has been beaten to death. The writers no longer emphasize the scientific and brain tingling aspect of Star Trek, they have fleshed it inside and out to make it an action exploitation film which does not fly well.  It's already got a narrow audience enough as it is that is narrowing even more.  Those intelligent aspects of Star Trek are the reason why we've loved it so hard and for so long once those things are gone, the franchise has lost its main fan base.  I remember being a small child when the Next Generation debuted and watching it all the way to its end and it was and still is an extreme pleasure to watch.  I even got the little kid kick from the beginning title sequence of the show and still do sometimes.  But, all the way through Nemesis, seeing how bad everyone aged and how it just all seemed so tired and run of the mill, was not an enjoyable aspect for me.  It is time for StarTrek to reinvent itself in a more up to date and intelligent fashion for secure survival of its future, should there be one.
0385504209|5.0|I would recomend this book to everyone. I just got it and I have not been able to put it down. Its a bit of a slow starter but very soon it will pain you to have to put it away for even a small amout of time. (which is saying something for all the back logging the plot requires) I have ever read Dan Brown before but I love his style and can't wait for his next book.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I don't know if it's their best.  All I know is that it's the ONLY album, of theirs or anyone else's, that I want to listen to today, the day after its release.  When they were singing morose melodies and lyrics in a period when everyone was employed, at ease, and at peace (except for those obsessing about Monica), they seemed slightly out of sync and maybe that's why some of us loved them so much.<br />But now, unfortunately, the times have caught up with Thom and the boys and they look and sound like prophets and their politics seem vital.  You don't have to dig too deeply into the lyrics (The Gloaming: &quot;Murderers you're murderers / We are not the same as you&quot;, is only one of hundreds of examples) to see that there is meat behind these metaphors.<br />And besides, I'm only human. &quot;There There&quot; simply makes me cry.<br />Thank you for this gift in dark times.
B000092ZYX|5.0|After two albums' worth of ear-numbingly bizarre tunes designed specifically to shake the band's many fans, Radiohead seems finally to have resigned itself to making good music. Don't get me wrong, I liked Amnesiac and loved Kid A, but in my opinion OK Computer was the pinnacle of this band's work. And Thom Yorke finally realizes this -- he adds the bone-dissolving electronic drumbeats and inch-thick layers of studio polish of the last two albums to the haunting guitar/piano/vocal melodies of their earlier work. Lyrically, Yorke extrapolates OK Computer's rambling poetry on technology and facelessness to governments and the corporate world, and the effect is as beautiful as ever.<br />The result is definitely interesting, and certainly improves on Amnesiac (probably their weakest outing to date, though an excellent disc in its own right). I admit I was disappointed to discover the overall quality doesn't quite match that of OK Computer, or even The Bends -- there's something missing here that overflowed in the catchier and more human tunes of those two discs -- but as those discs currently occupy spots in my top 10 albums of all time, I consider that no disgrace at all. And after a few more listens, maybe I'll have to clear a spot for a third Radiohead masterpiece.<br />Rating: 5/5.
0062515675|4.0|The author definitely imparts worthwhile advice. Being reminded of the value of simple joys is never a waste of time.  Knowing one's self well enough to live well and peacefully in a time when we have to consider disaster and terrorism - is an accomplishment of significant magnitude. However, it would seem that Mr. Sharma -too has seen the movie or read Hilton's Lost Horizon.  Reading the Hilton book or seeing the movie, one is pressed to examine life much as Sharma would suggest. <br />I enjoyed the reading - but found the Hilton/Sharma stories similarity somewhat unsettling.  For those folks not familiar with the Hilton story, Mr. Sharma has reminded us, yet again - of value found in peace of mind.

B000092ZYX|5.0|I was really surprised by this album.  It is a consistently passionate group of tracks.  Some songs are better than others.  I'd say there are four that are going to have to grow on me, but the rest of the tracks are massively expressive, tightly orchestrated, and very catchy.  After one listen I found several of the tracks reverberating in my imagination throughout the day.  It's a very eclectic album.  Kind of reminds me of the White album in that way.  Also in the way that it's purposely rough at the edges orchestration-wise, but musically so tight.<br />Hilights for me:<BR>Sit Down.  Stand Up.  Sail to the Moon.  Backdrifts (so catchy!)  There There. Scatterbrain.<BR> <BR>2+2=5... It reminds me of Queen a little, as it picks up at the end and the glorious, slightly demonic vocal harmonies rise with the guitar.  The tempo is almost too fast, almost dementedly insistent. It works brilliantly! <br />I've read people putting down &quot;I will&quot;.  This track moves me greatly.  It's very short, very simple.  The vocal harmonies, as always and throughout the entire recording, are challenging and fresh, and totally gorgeous.  <br />Myxomatosis... Goodness!  What a keyboard line!  And really strange harmonies that develop and bend, making you a bit queazy.   <br />This is a great album.  Definitely on the morose side, so not for every moment of the day or night, but a total classic!
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is more of a rant than a review (although admittedly with review portions throughout).  I don't understand the need to always rank every album, to judge each new album on its predecessors.  Certainly, if suddenly a band comes out with an album that is just horrid after a series of amazing albums, it is the first thing to pop in your head, but why all of the comments throughout reviews everywhere like &quot;this would be an amazing album if taken on its own, but in comparison to kid a and amnesiac it just seems to be lacking&quot;?  Even if you were to agree, why should that make any difference?  No matter how much I love Kid A or Amnesiac or Hail to the Thief or whatever, I'm still going to listen to the others.  I'm not a huge Pablo Honey fan but it still gets popped in the CD player from time to time, and when it does I would be wasting my time if instead of listening to the great tracks on that album I sat and complained about how it's not as groundbreaking as Kid A or as great of a guitar record as The Bends.  I listen to &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; or &quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot; and just am amazed by the songs.  Isn't that the whole point?  No qualifications, no comparisons.  It's a great album and will continue to be no matter what CD's are released in the future or which ones were released in the past.  If you haven't heard it, skip the 30 second clips here and listen to the whole album at radiohead.tv in order to get a much better listen.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Ok, what can I say about Radiohead that hasn't been said.... best group since Pink Floyd, jaja, The new beatles, Fusion between Electronic and rock?  let´s just say it's Radiohead.<br />And this album is Radiohead in all it's greatness.  <br />Let me borrow a thought from the title of a song.  ths album is exactly like track number 1. 2 + 2 = 5, This beeing said, it's Kid A and Amnesiac + Ok Computer and Pablo's honey = New album that has nothing to do with the others :)<br />You should buy this and ask no questions about it.  Just listen to it 2 or 3 times so you cand understand it.<br />Then again if you hate Radiohead there's nothing I can do about it, or can I?
B00008S2VG|5.0|altough i dont know every song from madonnas cd i love it.<BR>one song lets me know:WOW.I love it. Since i heard \\"Nothing fails\\" for the first time i listened to it again and again.<BR>It makes me almost cry.Its so full of emotion and feeling.<BR>\\"Hollywood\\", \\"American life\\" and \\"Die another day\\" are very good songs too.Go on, Madonna. We love you!!!
B000092ZYX|4.0|After the cold-chisel precision of Amnesiac, I was filled with more than a little trepidation at the prospect of another studio album from Radiohead. I Might Be Wrong was a gorgeous live recording in which the kids wholly redeemed themselves from the Kid A and Amnesiac sessions. Kid A, despite some truly beautiful spun-glass melodies and electronic bombast, always takes me to a black place, and Amnesiac, Like Spinning Plates excepted, is unlistenable. Not so with Hail to the Theif! Like a child outside a candy store, I eagerly awaited June 10th, willing to take one more chance on my favorite band. I was properly rewarded! Ed O'Brien has found his guitar again, God bless him, and Phil Selway pounds the skins like two jackrabbits.... well, you know the line. Where I End and You Begin has one of the most beautifully frightening refrains I've heard in a long time, as Thom quietly sings \\"I will eat you alive, there'll be no more lies\\" around an (electronic?)disembodied honeycomb voice that is the sonic equivalent of a wire clothesline being used as a lasso. Jonny keeps the ondes martentot to a minimum on this disc, despite it being listed in the instrumentals. Thom has stated in interviews that this is an album of veiled anger, but I felt a lot of warmth here as I listened to the entire album on headphones at three in the morning. His girlfriend Rachel is obviously doing that boy some good! Thom's voice is that of a wonder-filled six year old on The Gloaming, a song whose opening sounds like gold flakes ascending heavenward. The album is two songs too long, but it's Radiohead, and I forgive them. Don't let the ugly album cover deter you... this is an amazing recording!
0783233477|4.0|Yes, this movie is long, but it's a very delicious long. Like settling in with a good long book, this movie wraps around you as it explores thought-provoking ideas. Besides, what's wrong with long movies? I've read a number of reviews disparaging this film's length. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Ben Hur\\" are long, too, but both are well worth their three hours length. (Maybe what hurt this movie at the box office was its title, which, in my view, is nondescript.)<BR>Nevertheless, in \\"Joe Black,\\" I was fascinated by the premise of Death wanting to try out a corporeal existence. And what a great person to check it out with--the wealthy and successful Bill Parrish (Hopkins). He's smart, influential, upstanding, and, wow! He has some beautiful homes to just drool over and vicariously enjoy. (The indoor penthouse pool overlooking Manhattan! I want it!) <BR>Yes, the plot may be contrived, but the acting is stunning. I was pleasantly surprised by Brad Pitt. Certainly, he first captivated the world as the cocky young outlaw in \\"Thelma and Louise,\\" but in this film he shows he has some acting chops. Especially in the gorgeous sex scene where Death has his first taste of carnal knowledge. Pitt's expression of astonished ecstacy is exquisite. One quibble I have with his performance is the Jamaican accent he affects when encoutering a dying Jamaican woman. Why wasn't Joe Black's quiet, studied voice adequate for these scenes?<BR>Anyway, Claire Forlani, as the love interest, is wonderful, too. And where is she now? We should see more of this beautiful actress in American cinema. <BR>As for Anthony Hopkins, I would watch any of his films just because he's in them: if he's in it, it must be good. In \\"Joe Black,\\" his performance is as moving as his performance in the also wonderful \\"Shadowlands.\\"  <BR>The ending party scene in \\"Joe Black\\" will have your eyes welling as you long for the opposite of what is inevitable. <BR>The powerful, stirring musical score throughout just adds to the emotional punch. See this movie!
0452282152|5.0|The opening scene of this book is masterly: a girl, chopping vegetables in her home, arranges them by color and texture and tint, listening as her parents arrange for her to leave the only home she's ever known and go to work for the painter Vermeer. She becomes his helper and the subject of his painting. This wonderful, multi-layered book is historical fiction that rises many notches above other books in the genre.<BR>Vermeer's prosperous household is full of tensions: servents who have their own heirarchy, his domineering and perpetually-pregnant wife, the many resulting children, and his incredibly powerful mother-in-law. An exquisite  and painstakingly- researched portrayal of life in 16th century Delft through all levels of society - giving a vivid understanding of how small a sphere of life the characters were able to experience.<BR>Masterful and memorable book.
0694003611|5.0|This is a great book.  The reading is easy and it reads like a melody.  The pictures are bright, but not jarring...  the images relaxing.  The book is like sleep should be... relaxing and solid.<br />I would strongly advise getting the board book.  Its a good book for little children and regular pages dont hold up well with the little ones...and this one stands up to repeated readings.
B00005JJX8|4.0|Thank goodness they remade this Hitchcock film; it needed it. Wonderful pairing of two of the glossiest stars of the 50s when Hollywood excelled at just this kind of movie. Somebody is imitating the MO of retired cat burglar, Cary Grant, and it forces him back into service: a thief trying to catch a thief. Of course there must be a love interest: Grace Kelly, perfectly cast, the quintessential blonde actress who spawned an entire genre of look-alikes.<BR>This DVD offers some great extras including a bit piece about the making of the movie, some old-timers offering their memories, and more.<BR>You get more than your money's worth on this one.
0385504209|1.0|Brown did enough homework to fool the average reader, but reader beware!  The premise of this book regarding a vast conspiracy of the church to cover up the true identity of the holy grail is so far-fetched that fiction doesn't even begin to describe this literary work.  It would be one thing if Brown didn't claim that the descriptions of art and religious history were all true.  This tale is far-fetched, predictable and sells out to a reductionistic view of history.
0783241542|2.0|...I don't think I could recommend it to anyone without STRONG, STRONG CAUTION. I watched this last night for about the second time, and I still felt the same way about it. It's nothing to rave about, but it DOES have its funny parts. I laughed ALOT. I just thought that some of the scenes were TOO crude...SO crude that I don't think I'd wanna own it, much less recommend it to anyone. If you can handle the raunchy material...and believe me, theres plenty...you'll probably enjoy this one. I dunno. I just don't like alot of toilet/sexual humor. Thats just me. For the rest of you, it will be fun, fun, fun. <br />...
B00006RU5B|5.0|When i bought this cd i wasn't sure how it was going to sound, i mean rage against the machine mixed with soundgarden?  Hmm.  But the outcome was very nice.  I loved rage against the machine, and you can still tell by their style.  This is one of those cds you can listen all the way through and not change tracks or cds
B000092ZYX|5.0|I am a long time Radiohead fan who still favors the Bends over all the albums but I LOVE Hail to the Theif. This album is incredible, especially tracks &quot;2+2=5&quot; and &quot;There There.&quot; I can't recommend it highly enough. Go out and buy it, you won't regret it!
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is an incredible follow up to the double session albums Kid A and Amnesiac. One would almost describe Hail to the Theif as the final entry in the trilogy of experimental Radiohead. Hail To The Theif brings back Thom and the boy's interest in progressive rock that we loved greatly in OK Computer, but it also adds a new refined sound of the incredible piano/synth work we heard in Kid A and Amnesiac. <br />This album has quite a large amount of exceptional stand-out tracks, including \\"2+2=5\\", the prog-rock experience hinting at Thom's lonesome High School days. (he undoubtebly didn't \\"pay attention\\" in math class.) This song, goes through four different musical phases within 3 minutes and nineteen seconds. <br />\\"Sit Down, Stand up\\" is a brilliant almost epic-like song which again goes through several phases, with an incredible display of synthesized percussion mixed with Phil's drumming in the conclusion. Quit enjoyable to spook your friends out-the beat in the conclusion is almost unreal. <br />\\"Sail To The Moon\\" is a light piano-driven composition which I will admit, took me a few listens to appreciate, but is a decently melodic track with some good vocals/lyrics by Thom. <br />\\"Backdrifts\\", probably one of my favorite songs on this disc due to the elaborate arrangement/production. <br />\\"Go To Sleep\\", my favorite, and probably one of my favorite Radiohead songs. It is a guitar driven track which again signifies Radiohead's interest in section-based rock. <br />\\"Where I End and You Begin\\" is almost like an inside-radiohead anthem track, it kind of reminds me of the music from the soundtrack of the Nintendo 64 game, Perfect Dark, way back when. Very Depressive. Descent Song. <br />\\"There, There\\" a descent song, but not Radiohead's best. However the video is a good account of emotional exclusion, and individual questioning. <br />\\"A Punchup at a Wedding\\", a song I really enjoy because of the musical composition with the piano and the vocals. <br />\\"Myxomatosis\\",Creepy, but influential, proves you don't need power-fifth chords with the bass and distortion all the way up with predictable lyrics to sound world-altering (Linkin Park, Saliva, and practically all the other corporate scum-rock bands that are being signed today to sell-out.) <br />Do not take my word whilst you listen to this album. I refuse to review the album as whole track by track. These are my personal favorites songs, within my own opinion. It takes patience and time to enjoy the full capacity of this album. <br />Even after following Radiohead for many years, I still haven't fully figured out their purpose, or Thom's abstract, almost mind-twisting song-writing idiosyncracies. Radiohead has changed so much in the last 5 years. When I ask if people enjoy them, some simply reply \\"too weird\\", some reply \\"Amazing\\". However, Radiohead is Radiohead and if you enjoy them, you safely enjoy them. If you dislike them, than there is no in-between preference. However, I can safely say that with the Metaphorical lyrics which fully dominate this entire album (and previous albums), including the very title and liner notes, mixed with complex musical melodies and odd time signatures, this album is extremely enjoyable and worth the five stars. But you have to give Hail To The Theif your un-divided attention.
0140131558|5.0|The three different stories are all dark and thrilling psychologically. The style is fluid and intense. A real pleasure for the ones who like to avoid the regular &quot;happy ending&quot; novels.
B000092ZYX|1.0|i'm a big radiohead fan, i used to think they were the best band in the world, but come on, this album is a huge disappointment, mostly because it's terrible. i don't care if their songs have guitars, synths, electronics, or just triangle, the problem here is that there is no reason to ever listen to most of these songs.<br />'there there' is a sincerely great song, 'wolf at the door' has a terrific chorus, and the rest of these songs are b-sides. 'sail to the moon' has interesting chords, but the lyrics don't speak like they did on pyramid song. you can tell that with more work (like a rewrite of the inane first verse), it could have been much better. 'go to sleep' sounds like a track off of 'superunknown' (and would in fact sound better with cornell singing), and much of the rest of the album sounds like a modern-day depeche mode album gone awry. 'a punchup at a wedding' has a pleasant groove, but really, is that what one can settle for from the supposed greatest band in the world? on this album, it sounds good. on any other album, who cares.<br />ultimately, if you make a list of songs you might include on a 'best of radiohead' compilation, only 'there there' is a certainty for the top 20. that adds up to 'hail to the thief' being a failure. the one-star rating is all about expectation. if joe shmoe had put this album out, it would be five-stars. but for radiohead, these songs are a waste (to use one of their favorite terms).<br />looking deeper, the problem is probably that the rest of the band, including their producer, can no longer keep yorke and jonny in check. after the beatles split up, you could tell from their solo works that lennon and mccartney not only balanced each other musically, but also kept each other in check creatively, and without that kind of an equal to voice opposition or lend suggestions to song ideas, we got lots of mediocrity from both, where there had been none before.<br />our desire for anything new at all from radiohead, after listening to the other albums a bazillion times, makes even their mediocrity welcome. but truly, that is the explanation of whatever enjoyment you get out of this album. after 30 listens, yes, it's starting to sound better to me, but only because i need a temporary break from 'morning bell' and 'lucky'.<br />flan in the face, indeed. instead of a return to rock, how about just a return to melody?
B00008K79Q|5.0|I had never heard of this film until I saw it in a video store, and after picking it up off the shelf it looked interesting to me.  This is an IMPORTANT film about a little known chapter of Australian history (at least outside of Australia).  With our own shameful treatment of Native Americans, we can learn something from this film.  Absolutely great performances and cinematography.  Highly recommended!
B000002UJQ|1.0|It's got the keening long vocal style of Bono, but without the uplifting attempt at optimism.  It's sort of Bono gone flat.  No bubble, no tonic... It would be ok if it were *trying* to be dull but it's not, it's trying to be &quot;significant&quot; in the way Bono does.   I don't like Bono at all, he postures and so does Radiohead. But in a less inspired way.
B00005JL96|5.0|This was one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. It is not just a kiddie movie, this movie allows you to sit back and enjoy yourself for about an hour and a half. The story starts out with Stitch (code name 626) being exiled from his home planet and crash landing on the planet Earth. From there, it is a wild chase as two aliens try to track Stitch down so they can get their job back. The voices are done perfectly, Ving Rhames does a great job of his &quot;Social Worker&quot; character. Lilo plays her little girl role to the T, and Nadi (her sister) tries her hardest to stay one step ahead of the &quot;stupidhead&quot; social worker <BR>I laughed a lot during this movie, it is one you can watch over and over again with or without kids. Pick this up and add to your collection, you will not be dissappointed
B000092ZYX|5.0|Hail to the Thief continues the streak of superior albums recorded by Radiohead. Since the release of The Bends in 1995 the band has remained amongst the most original in the realm of popular music. This album is no different. Tracks like \\"Sail to the Moon\\", \\"We Suck Young Blood\\", \\"A Punchup at a Wedding\\" and \\"A Wolf at the Door\\" will be considered staples in the repetoire of the band's greatest songs, in my opinion. In these days of corporate sponsored boy bands and tired frat-rock, Radiohead remains a source of hope in the music industry. Highly recommended.
6305949980|5.0|Danny Elfman and Tim Burton are both absolute geniuses, a fact that will be apparent to all who see this film. As far as parents who may be concerend about showing this film to their children, this has been one of my five-year-old daughter's top choices since she was two or three years old! To adults, the characters may at first glance seem a little creepy for young viewers, but I think children are more likely to see them as wonderfully strange and fascinating monsters, especially since their personalities make them all seem more silly than scary. The storyline is also quite appropriate for children, as it conveys important messages regarding self-acceptance, friendship, and learning to appreciate the things you have rather than wanting what belongs to others. My daughter loves the music too, and we have both enjoyed the soundtrack and the film many times over the years. Very highly recommended for animation and fantasy enthusiasts of all ages!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Success brings alienation. A phrase that rings true for most artists as they grow more attentive to their craft. This is certainly true for Radiohead, after 1997's Ok Computer was proclaimed one of the best albums of the decade. The band went into the studio and forged two sanitized albums: Kid A and Amnesiac. These two albums, while they blossom, are pure studio creations, so precise in their make up that Radiohead acted as musical geneticists in their creation.<br />Thus, Hail to the Thief signals an opening out of that sheltered lab of music and back into conventional songwriting. It's safe to say that this album could not have survived the dissection lab of Kid A and Amnesiac, and thankfully, exist as songs. In the Radiohead catalog, Hail to the Thief is as refreshing as The Bends yet synthesized in Radiohead's current musical make-up. While the band is fickle about album creation, luckily the songs stand up on their own and destroy a great chunk of the competition out there, proving that Radiohead still is the best at what they do: write great, inventive music.<br />After hearing the sonic inventiveness of Kid A and Amnesiac, those capabilities are used in the songwriting of Hail to the Thief. Synths and break-beats dominate &quot;Backdrifts,&quot; primal drumming, churning bass-lines dominate &quot;Where I End and You Begin,&quot; while &quot;The Gloaming&quot; murders with thunderous bass and cooing vocals. The sonic capabilities are still there, yet now they are coagulated with the sounds of Ok Computer and the Bends: songs like &quot;There There,&quot; Go to sleep,&quot; and &quot;Scatterbrain&quot; seem to congeal the full spectrum of the Radiohead catalog and use techniques from all the albums. Make no mistake, though: the music is still superb, of equal quality of any album Radiohead has released. The difference that makes Hail to the Thief special is the relaxed qualities of it, a band enjoying the music it is creating.<br />Anything Radiohead releases has potential to be album of the year and this is no exception. Get Hail to the Thief.has potential to be album of the year and this is no exception. Get Hail to the Thief.
0385504209|5.0|I bought this book because it was on the NY times bestseller list and the small blurb I read was interesting. I had no idea I'd be so captivated by the the story. It was a page turner that kept me wondering... what will happen next and who's involved. I do believe that these reviews should just be a REVIEW and not a book report, so I will end by saying, I recommend this book to anyone... I am not an artist.. or any sort of scholar or even a student researching DaVinci or secret societies...  I read because I love to and this book beckons any on who's into a good mystery.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I have a major problem with this album ... it ends.  Other than that its a freakin masterpeice.
B00005B4GU|3.0|It's hard to say what makes you want to keep listening to an album, and what makes it languish on the rack, but I'm afraid after taking to this album with a passion for a month or so - especially the first half - it has become a languisher. Except for Life in a Glasshouse, which I still love, I never much feel the urge to listen to it. Who knows why: the songs are good, but they just don't have enough life - I never feel the urge to listen to them again. Maybe it's just because everything feels so carefully planned, every note and bleep in its right place: the music can't breathe - nothing surprises you after you've heard the album a few times. <br />Even the parts that are really novel lose their charm quickly, possibly because they seem to have been motivated mostly by the band's terror of writing a straightforward song. It's as if they were thinking: A pretty melody in Like Spinning Plates? Oh god, what can we do to it? Let's recite the lyrics backward and then reverse the tape! On some other song, let's put in a bizarre time signature, or just get rid of almost all of the lyrics, add some skronks, and feed Thom's voice through a machine. None of this serves the needs of the songs, as many of the flourishes did on Kid A, but only the band's need to convince people that they're on the cutting edge. They are, but they seem to have forgotten that a great song can get you there as easily as as a man talking backwards.
B00005U122|5.0|I recently bought this dvd on a whim. I was pleasantly suprised.<BR>The live show while lacking some of the early Floyd youthfulness,shows a well tuned and almost spunky Roger in full glory. The sound is wonderful. The camara angles just right. It truly made we wish I was there. If you are a Floyd or Roger fan don't hessitate.  Wish there were a few more tunes from his solo work though.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I hadn't really paid much attention to the reviews of \\"American Life,\\" so I was surprised to see people so divided over it here. \\"American Life\\" is a terrific follow up, and step forward from \\"Music.\\" The things she's writing about on this record (love, loss, materialism, spritiuality) are much more accessible than the abstract ideas she wrote about on \\"Ray of Light.\\" This may actually be the record that Jewel intended to make -- a comfortable mix of folk and electronica. Songs like \\"Love Profusion,\\" \\"Intervention,\\" and \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" are as compelling as anything on \\"Music\\" or \\"Ray of Light.\\" And \\"Nothing Fails\\" is hands down, one of the best Madonna songs of all time. The only thing that seems out of place on this record is the cold and uninvolving theme from \\"Die Another Day.\\" It is a testament to her talent that twenty years after \\"Madonna,\\" she has recorded such a compelling new cd. Those who don't like this one should let go of \\"The Immaculate Collection,\\" and give it another listen.
0385504209|1.0|I agree with the reader from Evergreen, CO - if you're going to write a book like this, do your homework first! I'm not an art history scholar, but I have two degrees in medieval history. The inaccuracy of the author's assertions about almost every historical reference I ran across in this book was appalling! I too tried to have fun with the story, but the bad research was so distracting that I never truly engaged in the book. If you are interested in reading a great book that also deals in similar subjects, go to the master - Umberto Eco - and read Foucault's Pendulum. Eco's breadth of knowledge is vast, and he deftly navigates not only history, but philosophy, theology, semiotics, philology, etc. and weaves them seamlessly into a captivating plot with 3-dimensional characters.
B000088E6D|5.0|The one weakness on this cd is quite a glaring one, the song \\"How Can you Mend A Broken Heart\\" is a piece of lounge music drivel that is reminiscent of what you would hear at a late night geriatric karaoke party.  That being said, the rest of the material is so outstanding that it easily overshadows this song.  His version of Fever is different from what normal covers however he breathes energy and a hint of sexiness into the song and makes it his own.  My favorite by far is Sway, which does have an entertaining mambo swing quality to it.  As you can tell from the song list there is an eclectic assortment of musical styles represented, however the vocal talents of Buble are able meld all of these songs together into a fantastic cd.  There are a few instances on the cd of overproducing, however Bubles exceptional talents are allowed to shine through.  I would hesitate though to continually compare him to the greats of years past since he is a newcomer and still very young.  However, he aptly demonstrates throughout the cd that he has the talent to become quite a force in jazz music.  He has a very refreshing voice and the appeal to bring jazz and blues into the mainstream.  He is an exceptionally talented young man and I would recommend him highly to any and all people (regardless of their musical tastes).
B000023VR6|5.0|Dre, like his former partner Ice Cube, is able to do what many gangster rappers are not and that is evolve. I have never heard a Dre production that sounded like he was following a trend. Instead, almost always dre is creating the trends with his musical style and even the directional input that he provides on the content of the lyrics. 2001 represents a more mature, introspective Dre, and while still carrying much of his original gangsta flavor, adds more by way of thought and content. It's ironic that the man who brought gangster rap to its epitome  would be the one walk away from it, thus creating yet another direction for other rappers to follow.<br />Unlike many of the &quot;Original Gangsters&quot; who played themselves out by trying to over-sell their hardness to audiences. Dre does the exact opposite by playing the role of an OG who looks back on this past and looks forward on his career. That coupled with Dre's smooth attitude and the impressionable appearances of Snoop, Nate, XYZbit, Em, and even MC Ren makes the album a linear musical experience that carries you from beginning to end.<br />Though he founded G-Funk, in typical dre fashion, in 2001 he refuses to look back and return to old creations. Instead, he upgrades his music to a blend of traditional rap with futuristic and R&amp;B sounds. What this new sound will be called, I don't know.<BR>But this album confirms why Dre is the most influential man in hip-hop today.
0790731479|5.0|Not many people were prepared when they stepped into the world of director Tim Burton. They probably didn't know that they would be entering a director's vision unlike anyone else's. It will be one great ride!. Up until this point, the only work that the general public would of known of Burton, would of been his 1985 fillm, \\"Pee Wee's Big Adventure\\". That movie was more normal than anything else he has done. Not that that movie was entirely normal. This film was the first time Burton's wacky world was truly developed. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis star as a young married couple named Adam and Barbara. They live in a small, idyllic looking town, that appears to be in the country. They live in a nice, old fashioned type house, and seem to be perfectly happy. One day, they decide to take a ride into town to pick up some things, and they get into a car crash. All seems normal when they return home, until new people begin to move into their home. Adam and Barbara realize that they didn't survive the car crash, and they are dead. They are horrified and sad when the new owners begin moving in. They are a rich, uppity, New York family named The Deets. Catherine 'O' Hara and Jeffrey Jones(who later went on to become a Burton regular, appearing in \\"Ed Wood\\" and \\"Sleepy Hollow\\"), play the parents, while young Winona Ryder(who also re-joined Burton in his classic \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" movie), plays their black wearing, goth looking daughter, Lydia. Adam and Barbara are so upset with the new owners and what they are doing to their house, that they decide to scare them away. Their efforts go unnoticed by the couple, but not by Lydia. She befriends them. Adam and Barbara call on Beetlejuice, a ghost who is living in the cemetary of Adam's model of the town in the attic, to rid the pests. Little do they know that Beetlejuice himself, will be the biggest pest of the two. Michael Keaton plays Beetlejuice, and it is one of his stand out roles. He is brilliant in the role, and seems toreally be having a good time with it. He is rude, crude, smelly, gross, and mischievious. He is truly one of the best screen oddities in a long time. The rest of the cast are all solid, if not exactly earth shattering. Winona, who I believe was around 15 at the time, is really cute to watch. Odd visuals and decorations are pretty common place in films nowadays, but this one was really the first of it's kind. There had been nothing like it before. Burton would continue to top himself with movies like \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", \\"Ed Wood\\", and \\"Sleepy Hollow\\", but this film was the first one where we really got our first glimpse into his macabre world. The script is quick and sharp, with witty dialogue and entertaining set pieces. The art direction is astonishingly cool and very well done. Not everyone got this movie, and were turned off even further because of it's many odd eccentricities. Too bad for them. This is a one of a kind movie that should be enjoyed over and over again. Beetlejuice!! Beetlejuice!!  Beetlejuice!!.
B00003CXXM|1.0|It takes a lot of skill to make a crackling good action pic.  It takes talent of a different sort to make a film this listless and dull.  So dull, in fact, that I turned it off 10 minutes before the end.  That's how much I didn't care.  Great actors like Brian Cox, Clive Owen and Chris Cooper are completely wasted, and are we really supposed to believe that 18-year-old Julia Stiles runs the CIA's covert Paris offices?  There's absolutely no chemistry between the co-stars (the director wisely pulls the camera away when they start to kiss) and Damon proves that, as good an actor as he can be (\\"Good Will Hunting\\" and particularly that Meg Ryan/Denzel Washington pic), he's really not a movie star.  A big \\"who cares.\\"
B00000AOUD|5.0|One of the finest albums I've ever heard. Versatility of musical styles in &quot;Thick&quot; is just amazing. Sometimes folk, rock, and bluesy. All coloured with fantastic acoustic guitar and flute sounds. Simply said: I love it!
B000092ZYX|5.0|If you have &quot;gotten it&quot; so far, you'll &quot;get&quot; this.
0156027321|5.0|Ok, I had my doubts about this one. How could an author really make being lost at sea with a tiger interesting for 300-some-odd pages? Well, I admit it when I'm wrong...this book managed to be amazing. <br />Pi Patel is an old soul in a young body...a sensitive young man who prescribes to all varieties of religion, and grows up among the animals in the Pondicherry zoo where his father oversees things. While on the way to Canada, the ship carrying Pi, his family, and some of the zoo animals sinks and Pi is left with a lifeboat full of violent creatures, and he must survive the fray. <br />Life of Pi is a voyage filled with periods of turmoil and serenity. Pi must physically survive, glean the will and tools to survive from his limited surroundings, grapple with his spirituality, grief, and loneliness, and learn to deal with a deadly tiger in a very limited amount of territory. I found the whole book enthralling, especially the ways in which Pi met his needs for food, water, shelter, and dealt with a variety of other problems. There's even a bit of a twist at the end that I found heartbreaking, frustrating, interesting, and ultimately very clever. The book makes you question what is real and unreal and what's worth putting faith in. <br />The only warning I have for readers: lots of animal violence. With animals in a lifeboat there's bound to be some bloodshed.
079072961X|5.0|This is a very fine movie indeed, and an excellent vehicle for both Ford and Jones (the latter reprising his world-wise character in 'US Marshalls' opposite Wesley Snipes). The action sequences are breathtaking, but it's the drama and build-up of tension that really gives it the edge - is the innocent doctor going to be caught or not? And will he achieve justice? Intelligent and canny, the pressure is never let up. <br />Best interaction between the two 'adversaries':<br />Ford (with gun on Jones): \\"I didn't kill my wife!\\"<BR>Jones (hands in the air): \\"I don't care!\\"
076790592X|5.0|I'd heard raves about Tuesdays with Morrie, so I was ready for a let down (due to overhype), but to my great surprise this book enchanted me. Mitch Albom was wrapped up in material things and career concerns until he was reunited with his dying professor. Albom's time with Morrie Schwartz, before his death, is chronicled in this charming little book. The lessons might seem cliché or maudlin in the hands of another writer, but because Albom had such a close relationship with Morrie the professor's personality really comes through in the book. What might've been sappy otherwise comes through with heartfelt meaning and the sincerity with which it was so lovingly passed on to Albom as he talked with his friend in his dying days. This book is not all heavy and filled with seriousness. There's a great deal of humor in Morrie's attitude, lessons, and stories and I found myself laughing out loud several times. <br />In addition to the great story, I was also impressed with the layout of the book. Albom intermingles old memories from his college days in Morrie's classes among the short chapters dealing with specific life lessons like aging, love, and death. This method of layout made for an engrossing, and very fast-moving read. I blew through the book in only a few hours and was completely satisfied with its well roundedness. There was laughter as well as tears, and I came away from the book feeling enriched.
B000092ZYX|1.0|Well....I should probably start this off by saying I really, really love &quot;The Bends&quot;.  It's in the top5 of my collection, and gets played regularly. I picked up some of Radiohead's other offerings with the hope I'd find another &quot;Bends&quot; to add to my collection....I could not have been more disappointed.  I don't care for the &quot;electronic-techno&quot; sound they employ so often...and this album just continues that course.  Initially I was sort of hopeful, as 2+2=5 sounds as though it could grow on you....but it didn't.  Weird pinging sounds with &quot;fax machine screeches&quot; interrupted occasionally by a Thom Yorke wail do not equal good music for me.  To be quite honest I'm left wondering if the rest of the reviewers here have lost their minds? (or, more likely, their hearing?)  This is awful and left me wondering how I could love EVERY track from &quot;The Bends&quot; and yet not find one other Radiohead offering worth listening to...
6305603847|5.0|BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!! If you like Pink Floyd. If You Like The Wall album. Brilliantly Acted and Written. Roger Waters is the best artist in the world. The Animations for this movie blow any cartoon out of the water.<BR>what else do i need to say
B00005JLXE|5.0|I still wonder how people can not like this movie.  Some argue about not staying true to the comic book.  Well this is the movie that sticks to the comic book THE BEST!!! And the acting is top notch!  The action scenes (and there are a TON) are well directed, much better than Spider-Man.  This movie is more about trying to stop villains... No, not superpowers, (except for the heightened senses) just a blind man trying to serve justice!  Take a DARE and see this movie!  You won't be disappointed!!
B000001ELB|5.0|this album is a classic, it has all of the Kiss rocking tunes from the 70's, the bass lines kick...!!, and I love the guitars playing together in octaves. Good purchase.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I got a copy of this in Switzerland, which does not include any of the extras - just the 10 episodes, which is already easily worth the price.  I wish I could see the extras.<br />The miniseries is an absolutely fantastic show.  The realism is absolute, and it is amazing to see the faces of the actual survivors of Easy Company confirming at each episode that what you see happening - worthy of the finest Hollywood fiction screenwriters - actually happened for real.  These guys have &quot;seen the elephant&quot;, so to speak.  Some survived, many did not.<br />I find myself grateful to HBO for this series, just like with the similarly stellar miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, they have reached back and plucked from history the actual motivations and personalities that drove those events.  In the case of &quot;Band Of Brothers&quot;, this is even more pressing and urgent, as those guys who remember those events will not be with us much longer.  So I am grateful that HBO has taken the time, money and most importantly the care to tell these stories as they actually happened, before the experience is lost to us all.<br />These men sacrificed years of their lives and went through hell itself.  Many did not survive (in fact it is appalling to read, at the end of some episodes, the sheer number of casualties the Airborne suffered - 50% or more at every major engagement).  And they did this simply because their nation asked them to do it, leaving their homes, jobs and families to do so.  Does today's generation have what it takes to do it again?
B000002J20|5.0|Beautiful album you get so drawn into this album because of the beautiful melodies and peaceful vocals from Jon Anderson.  This album i always put it on and go to bed and it's just the perfect music to listen to when your about to go to sleep...although not my favorite yes album it is indeed awesome and i honestly believe that yes is the only band in the universe that could pull of a record like this
B000092ZYX|5.0|I don't have much to say. I think this album makes Radiohead's sound concrete. They've spent the last years gathering new sounds and ideas and now they are laying them out on the table and picking from them. Working to get a perfect mixture. Some say this is a re-hash of the same sound but its not. It's the same ideas. And they've earned the right to settle momentarily before going out again. A very political album without being direct. That shows artistic maturity. If you're a Radiohead fan then you don't even need to read this because I'm sure you've had your mind made up. They could have made an album full of kazoos and still would have found the perfect melody. Even their B-sides can't be touched by any other band. ALL HAIL TO THE THIEF!
B000002UB6|2.0|This was to be the Beatles last album together realeased in 1970 this was a horrible ending for a great career. Let it be is the 2nd worst beatles album in my opinion(Please Please me being the worst) it seemed to me like the beatles were just writing and not caring if it sounded good or not the only decent track on this album is &quot;the long and winding road&quot; othere than that i think this was just a waste of time and money.
6305252521|5.0|Inspiring, revealing and eclesiastic, The Truman Show is probably one of the most original movies ever made. Rich in symbolism and underlining a hidden message, a message of Gnosis (true knowledge), the movie is done as to present a long-waited, esoteric message through the best available media today - Television. Everything from the name itself - &quot;the show of the true man&quot;, to characters involved in the movie: his parents Angela (Angel) and Kirk (Scotish for Church), to even the name of the boat that serves as an escape route from this false reality - Santa Maria (in honor of Saint Mary - Mary Magdalene), every detail of the show is presented in such a way as to make viewer feel as he is Truman, make him realize that maybe he's part of the bigger show as well, make him open his eyes and start noticing things differently, make him see the reality, the reality beyond the world created by &quot;Architect&quot; (whose role is brialiantly played by Ed Harris). After all, aren't we all sons and daughters of Church and Angels? Don't we all feel like puppets in the bigger show sometimes? Don't we all question the reality from time to time? Well, he could do it and now it's your time to find your boat and set sail towards reality, and in case you don't come back, good afternoon, good evening and good night.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Ok, I rated it 5 just because the last two movies were awesome.. But I think that if Andy and Larry were to read this they would probably be sick.. First off, the two previous movies should have taught you to think outside the box.  Saying that this is a matrix within a matrix would be too simple and easy to just write off.. The key with this one is Agent Smith.  Smith before his first destruction was one with the matrix and to a certain degree with the sentinals that attack the rebals, right? Well if Smith was able not only to some how take some of Neo's code with him and thus multiply, why not have Neo do the same with Smith, where Neo integrated some of Smith's coding (remember, Neo is made up of coding as well, since the Matrix needs his coding in order to fix the matrix which also gives him special powers within the matrix).  So, if this is all true, then isnt it quite possible that Neo has become some kind of wireless network to the matrix, not so much that he can tap into it, but that he can control the sentinals to a certain degree as Smith did? Im just trying to think outside of the box..
0783225857|5.0|This film ruined me for all time. <BR>  I first saw it as a child and 'Atticus Finch' set the bar so high as to what it meant to truly be a man that I don't think any living person will ever be able to match it.<BR>  Humility, honor, dignity, truth, integrity, justice, compassion, bravery and love. Gregory Peck's remarkable portrayal personified all those characteristics in a way that we are not likely to ever witness again.<BR>   The scene in the courtroom after Atticus' closing arguments when the 'balcony people' all rise and Scout is told to stand because 'You're father is passing', will never fail to move me to tears.<BR>   Every moment of this film is executed with complete integrity and every actor, most remarkably the children, is to be commended. This has to be seen to be believed. Without ever being preachy, all parties involved have made one of the most outstanding arguments ever committed to celluloid against racial hatred and prejudice. It is easy to see why so many attorneys will tell you that this film made them take up law.<BR>   I am writing this on the day of Gregory Peck's passing and I want to send a heartfelt 'Thank You', out to the universe or heaven as the case may be, to the man who cared enough to give such a perfect rendition of all that is good that it was deservedly ranked as number one on AFI's list of 'The Top 50 Most Heroic' screen characters. A proud and fitting legacy from a truly remarkable actor.

B000092ZYX|5.0|It was early April when the unmastered tracks of Radiohead's sixth studio album were leaked onto the internet and circulated like wildfire via popular fan websites. I remember deciding to check up on what one of my favorite bands had been up to in the many months that I had last read some news of them; and it was just my luck that, as I clicked on the \\"News\\" section ..., I was informed that all fourteen tracks off of \\"Hail to the Thief\\" had been put up onto the internet. It was like over five years of memories had flooded back into my memory: Christmas 1997, opening up a present and finding \\"OK Computer\\"; Fall 2000, downloading leaked tracks from \\"Kid A\\" and being dumbfounded with amazement; Summer 2001, going to the local CD store and buying the limited edition of \\"Amnesiac\\", and spending at least an hour examining it. It was an almost otherwordly feeling, something that can only be felt when something truly special happens. Such was the case with these new leaked songs, and I instantly downloaded all fourteen of them, burned them onto a CD, went to my room, and listened to it non-stop three times through. Bear in mind that, while I was listening to this, this was the first time I had listened to a Radiohead song in at least three or four months, probably more. Nor had I listened to any of these songs live or in any other format. The result, as you can imagine, was an astonishing and extraterrestrial experience. And to think that these were only the unmastered, unmixed, incomplete versions of the songs! The final versions which would be released legally in June, I thought, can't be anything but orgasmic. <br /> Finally, it's June, and that New Radiohead Album atmosphere is most definitely in the air. There are posters everywhere, newspaper articles and interviews galore, the brilliant video for the first single, \\"There There\\"; the only thing left to do is release the damn CD. Thankfully, the agonizing wait ever since early April is worth it on all accounts. Among the fourteen songs (all of which can be deemed a standout track), there are truly inspiring moments that any true music fan should at least listen to: the sudden burst of energy (here, Thom screams \\"You have not been paying attention!\\") halfway through the mini-epic about society not wanting to do anything about Big Brother taking over the world (it's more interesting than it sounds, trust me), \\"2+2=5\\"; a bizarre and brilliant noise at 2:04 of \\"Go to Sleep\\" that has to be heard to be understood; all of \\"Where I End and You Begin\\", quite possibly one of the greatest songs Radiohead has ever made, complete with vivid imagery (\\"I'm sorry for us, the dinosaurs roam the earth, the sky turns green, where I end and you begin\\"), a killer bassline, and a chilling final line (\\"I will eat you alive\\"); the climax of \\"Myxomatosis\\", where all of the harsh synths that have come and gone throughout the song come together, while Thom tells the world, \\"Now no one likes a smartass, but we all like stars; but that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason\\". <br /> In \\"Scatterbrain\\", there is a segment of the song from 1:55-2:05, that defies explanation; it's one of the most chilling moments on the entire album, and I don't even know why. It's subtleties like these that make HTTT so damn good. With each listen, you discover more and more things you didn't hear, or you hear a lyric that you didn't understand before, and then the song makes complete sense. Take \\"A Wolf at the Door\\"; you cannot fully appreciate this song (which, by the way, is probably the best Radiohead closer ever) unless you read the stream-of-consciousness type phrases and words that Thom abrasively murmurs in the verses. The worst tracks on the album, by the way, are \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" and \\"A Punchup at a Wedding\\"; they're nowhere near bad, in fact, they're pretty much up to par with the rest of HTTT, but they don't bear repeated listens as well as the other songs.<br /> It's so hard to classify HTTT in terms of their previous albums and where each one stands. This isn't OK Computer (see: Backdrifts, The Gloaming), and this definitely isn't Kid A or Amnesiac (see: 2+2=5, Go to Sleep, There There)... so then what the hell is it? In the opinion of this reviewer, that isn't something that should really be given a whole lot of thought. The best thing to do with HTTT is to sit back and enjoy its near-hour of Britrock perfection.<br />-JHJ

B00009APK1|4.0|As far as movies go, this movie was amazing.  I won't comment on the incredible special effects and feel of the movie, because so many more already have and in great detail.<br />But the movie does have flaws from an accuracy standpoint.<BR>Am I a hardcore Tolkein fan who will only accept a verbatim transfer of book to screen? No.  I understand there are budget and time constraints.  Some things need to be omitted or blended, etc. etc.  <br />However, the movie portrays several characters inaccurately and even invents some scenes.  What is the gain in this?<br />Faramir was not weak-willed (when it comes to the ring) like his brother Boromir was. He never forced Frodo and Sam to accompany them to Gondor!   Why was he so inaccurately portrayed?<br />Aragorn falls off a cliff??  Hmm.. let me find the page where that happened.  Oh wait.. it didn't.  And it didn't add anything to movie other than more unnecessary innacuracy.<br />And how about Merry and Pippin duping the Ents into fighting?  That was just ridiculous.  However, the power of the Ents was right on, which ALMOST makes up for making them stupid.<br />Overall between the two movies my only other notable complaint would be the portrayal of Frodo as well.  In the films he is made to appear nearly fully in the ring's control already.  Frodo was overcome in the end but resisted with much more vigor throughout than is portrayed by the movie.<br />These movies should have been made more for Tolkien \\"fanatics\\" than the unknowing general public.  The story would have still been more than captivating to those who have never read the books, and they wouldn't have known any better.  People who did read the books suffer until they're memory of the actual story is replaced by the movie...<br />Once again, it's completey understandable and acceptable to exclude scenes..blend certain lesser characters, etc.  But portraying main characters inaccurately and creating scenes just to add...well, I don't know what they were supposed to add, is a true shame.  These movies are great on their own, and I've watched them over and over.  But the afore mentioned lack of adherence sometimes make me cringe for what they are and for the fact that making these movies was a once in a lifetime chance to do it right, and I don't think they're as good as they could have been... which is still really d*mn good!<br />Summary:  movie = great, accuracy = lacking at points (points where it was completely unnecessary to do so due to movie-making contraints)

B000096I9G|4.0|I bought this DVD solely for the performance of the Pornography album, my and many others' favorite Cure album. The only  disappointment with the performance--and unfortunately it's a major one--is that the drummer plays behind the beat on nearly every song. This gives the impression that the band is constantly running out of steam. For such an intense album, this dragginess saps a lot of power from these songs. <br />There are two exceptions, though: \\"The Figurehead\\" which sounds slightly more relaxed and melodic than the album version; and an absolutely amazing performance of \\"Cold\\"--if only the whole set could have been this good! <br />On the minus side, \\"Short Term Effect\\" and \\"Pornography\\" don't come off too well because of the dissonant Arabic guitar lines that never quite match up properly.<br />Generally, though, everything in the set sounds good but the drumming. In the interview section of the disc the drummer admits being slightly uncomfortable playing these older songs. Going to the Bloodflowers set you can hear how much better he is playing his own parts.<br />As far as the rest of the DVD is concerned, I enjoyed:<br />The Interviews, especially Robert's<BR>Stage, Light Show<BR>Simon Gallup's stage presence w/ low slung bass a la Paul Simonon/Peter Hook<br />Definitely worth a rental...
B00005RY7X|1.0|wow seriously, dont be fooled by the terrible reviewers who said this album was great.  This album is one where you should burn it off your friend, laugh at it for about 10 mins then thrown away.  I mean its funny, but anyone who actually takes this music seriously must have something wrong with them.  Really dont buy this album, you will regret it.
B00008LDPU|5.0|For those of you who have never been into Anime (like me), The Animatrix should be the first you buy.  Not only does it include 9 incredible works of art, but also a bonus feature which explains the history of Anime and it's role on society.  This made me view Anime in a different light and has permanently made me a new fan.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|It took me a few times to listen to the album in order to appreciate it.  Once you cut through the 3 or 4 songs that are geared to a younger audience, you will find Fleetwood Mac at it's best.  Subtract a few of Lindsay Buckingham's attempts at creating a new sound and give those songs to Christine McVie (who is missing on this album) and you'd have their best effort in years.
0060930187|5.0|The story can be compared to Catcher In The Rye in that the main characters of both stories are similarly out of place in society.  They feel as though there is something in life that is missing, but continue living not knowing what it is until they eventually have a mental breakdown.  Sylvia Plath, however, writes in a much more poetic language than Salinger.  Her words could be violently beautiful, or peacefully bloody, but what can one expect from a novel by a poet.

B000092ZYX|5.0|With the grave assertions and deadly sonic expanses of both Kid A and  Amnesiac, Radiohead seemed determined to shock you with an over-bearing minimalism that showed their catharsis to insane and sometimes inane degrees. Not that these albums lacked the adequate artistic fervour of Ok Computer or the densely populated assaults of The Bends, but the were more humble than their predecessors and seemed more content to mumbled the content rather than scream and sway beneath Thom Yorke's lilting Soprano. Hail to the thief is epic. It has more purpose and fills in with the \\"concept album\\" parade that Radiohead started with Ok Computer. Unlike Kid A and Amnesiac, HTTT starts right off with a bonifide rocker in \\"2+2=5\\" something that both predecessors failed to do. This hooks you into the album right away and shows that whatever their critics might say, Radiohead still Rock-and-Rolls better, faster and with more chutzpah than any other Brit-Pop or most notably, any American rock group (besides maybe The White Stripes) in the last decade. This album marks the return of fervid, soul-searing vocals with powerful phrasing and sputtering by Thom Yorke. On Kid A and Amnesiac, Thom Yorke's voice was so full of electronic, fuzzed-out effects that his true beauty could not shine throught the way it had on The Bends or Ok computer. Listen to Sail to the Moon or, my particular favorite Sit Down, Stand Up for true Thom Yorkedom. He wails like there is something to wail about again and now his desperation and alienation seems to be more concentrated into a deathbeam of falsetto anihilation. I am also sure that nearly every one out there will be as equally intrigued and blown away by We Suck Young Blood (hint: clapping never sounded so foreboding and dirge-like on any \\"pop\\" album) it really is a gem amongst this mine. This record seems to have the capability to win back some disaffected souls from the Bends and Ok Computer and will equally solidify the new legions of fans' admiration. But this album not because I say so, but because 1 million strong, independent-minded, and disgruntled people are now flying the same banner and they have and have always had a spokesman in Radiohead, those lovable tramps from Oxford.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This is why you buy that ..., decked out, system for your car! <BR>Godsmack welcomes all to be beaten down with their 2003 release, FACELESS. \\"Straight Out of Line\\" introduces us into a war-zone as we prepare to jump into the fury that Godsmack had laid down of the 12 track album[Ed. This is where you should crank up that the bass, and have a subwoofer at least 3 feet away from your body]. <BR>Like clock-work; the beats rumbling off Shannons drums, the drilling-cuts of Tonys guitar, the hollowing rips that come from Robbies bass, all seem to come together with the thundering vocals only Sully could produce.[Ed. Speaking of production, Sully also co-produced Faceless with David Bottrill] <BR>If afraid that Godsmack has changed thier style, DON'T BE!!! This album is so hard hitting it loosens up the toenails and rattles the fillings in the mouth. As new themes arise through out Faceless, the beats do not stop pounding. Faceless captures Godsmacks energy, and makes you panting for more.[Ed. If part of The VoodooTribe, by the way is the BEST F'N FANCLUB IN THE WORLD, you can access 3 bonus live tracks and lyrics from Faceless]. <BR>Buy this album!!! Buy it if you need something new to listen to. Buy it if you want to be enlightened, buy it if your'e a fan. But since youre reading this, youre probably already a fan and had already bought it... well buy it AGAIN!!!!!! I got three copies  <BR>PEACE <br />-keep on smackin'-

This record seems to have the capability to win back some disaffected souls from the Bends and Ok Computer and will equally solidify the new legions of fans' admiration. But this album not because I say so, but because 1 million strong, independent-minded, and disgruntled people are now flying the same banner and they have and have always had a spokesman in Radiohead, those lovable tramps from Oxford.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Finally Radiohead has decided to take some responsability of their success and live up to their \\"one of the most influential band of the 90s\\" status: Hail to the Thief is a consistent yet unique record that blends elements of rock and \\"electronica\\". <br />2+2=5 has got to be their best opener track ever, starting slow and gentle and growing into a song that would fit \\"The bends\\" nicely. Sit down, Stand up is another interesting song, a little more creepy though. Backdrifts, Go to sleep, There There or a Punch up at a wedding... help in creating that spooky sound that is very much the spirit of the band. Wolf at the door is one of the highlights of the album (and it's final track) while \\"I will\\" is a \\"simple\\" (it is never simple with Radiohead) and short acoustic number.<br />Nevertheless, there are some songs that could have been easily thrown away from the final cut: We souck young blood and Where I end and you begin not only are too long and boring, they don't add absolutely nothing to the album and are placed in the middle of it (which is a bit of a turn off).
B000092ZYY|4.0|For 1, buy the regular edition, the limeted isn't all that good.<br />This is a cd of great songs, but it dosn't seem to be all one album like Kid A or Amnesiac or OKC.  It combines all of them, which makes it harder to listen to from start to finish.  Great moments enclude, The Gloaming, and Punch up through wolf.  But if you are new to Radiohead, start with OKC, then Kid A, ect ect.  You will enjoy listening to this and remember it as Radiohead's only pop album (hopefully.)  So pick it up!<br />If you want a sample, download these:<br />Were i end and you begin<BR>Scatterbrain<BR>Myxomatosis<BR>Wolf At the Door
B000092ZYX|1.0|Radiohead used to rock.  Plain and simple.  Listen to &quot;Killer Cars,&quot; listen to The Bends, listen to Pablo Honey.  They rocked.  Plain and simple.  Somewhere along the line, though, the excessively introspective Yorke gave into his pretentious inner-voices and began producing intellectual good-for-your-mind pap.  When Radiohead was a rock band, they were the best rock band on the planet.  They seem too young to have hit middle-aged hackdom so soon, but alas, Hail to the Thief is just yet another confirmation of this sad truth.
B00005JLXE|3.0|With every rule there are exceptions.  The rule for Daredevil is you either loved it or hated it.  Die hard Daredevil fans will most likely hate it due to it butchering of the story lines taken from the comics themselves.  Those who are not fans will most likely enjoy it for it effects, the love story and kinetic action.  I am the exception that I spoke of earlier.  Yes, the characters, story arcs and even some of his powers have been altered for unknown reasons, but if you watch it for what it is, it's pretty good.  No where near the statis of Spider Man, or Xmen (1 or 2), or I suspect even as good as the upcoming Hulk.  But Daredevil was never a wholly mainstream book and it's readers were not always faithful.  Changing writers made the books appeal dip up and down like a rollercoaster.  In turn the cutural consequences of messing with the character didn't carry the weight that it would if characteristics were changed for Spider Man or Xmen.  I liked the movie as a whole, but some aspects were foolishly changed and I cannot understand why.  It's action packed, the chemistry between Garner and Affleck is good, but not great.  Affleck actually plays the character well, and accuratly.  It's strange that with his hollywood status, and his well known liking of the character, that he let this inconsistancy happen.  But it could have been his idea, who knows.  There will most likely be a sequel, let's hope things get better.  I would actually give it three and half stars.
038572179X|4.0|This intelligent novel is, among other things, proof that a small misstep or misunderstanding can ruin your life. The tragedy of this story is that the accusation that leads to ruination is made, unassumingly by a child, Briony Tallis.  But she grows into the tragedy as her senses and mind awaken...and her life becomes an atonement for what she has done.<br />Wreaking havoc on lives proves a difficult thing for Briony to live with, particularly after she (and we) are made to understand the full extent and implication of what she has ruined. The atonement referred to in the book's title is incomplete and can never change the course of events her one small action set forth. At the same time, it is the only understandable way to live with her conscience. The fact that Briony's atonement is attempted but never able to be consummated is what makes this book so heartbreakingly real-so much of life is sealed behind closed door, unforgiven, leaving tearful hearts left to reckon and wonder how things might have turned out differently.<br />The book's strength is that it is not overwhelmingly about Briony, but more about the other characters affected by her actions. Pick up, read, enjoy the historical detail--you won't be disappointed.
B000063UR2|3.0|The viewing of Legend has always been something of a mixed blessing and concern for me, primarily because of the duality which exists within me regarding the film.  While calmly thinking of the movie with ample distance of time, I often think that it may have the merits of being dubbed with the term \\"Fantasy\\" at least of the second degree.  However, after several viewings over the years, I have finally come to the certain conclusion that this film is a mere attempt at Fantasy and cannot be dubbed anything other.    While there is something endearing in the visual and dramatic effects of the film, on the whole, Legend betrays the heart of Fantasy by being far too whimsical.  While I do not think that Fantasy need be grim and dour, I most certainly do think that it should at least take itself seriously in its content.  However, the sense which one gets from Legend is that both evil and good (in the secondary realm which is created for the production of Legend) cannot abide the thought of taking their contest with anything remotely resembling the gravity which is properly due to any moral striving.  Instead, the characters engage in jocundity to such an extent that the viewer has no perception of any importance in the story itself.  The inner consistency is thereby shattered, leaving only some beautiful shards upon the ground.    I do not like to be overly negative in a review, for it is my opinion that there is always something good to be gleaned from our experiences.  For this reason, I do wish to at least end on this note.  While Legend is disappointing in its portrayal of a fantastic realm, it does provide for an easy viewing for one who has the time for a movie which bears the marks of fantasy in its period.  For its faults, it remains a light-hearted tale which is not wholly corrupted, although it does fall short of the high standards of True Fantasy.

B00005ATQF|4.0|While most Vietnam era movies focus on the \\"loss of innocence\\" at a national level using characters as stereotypes.  \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" looks at what war does to someone inwardly. From the ritual debasement of training to combat itself, Kubrick's focus is always intensely personal.<br />This makes for an excellent film with only one major flaw: R. Lee Emery is killed 45 minutes into it.  His intensity and passion cannot be sustained by the Marines or the combat sequences that follow.  Consequently, the whole movie deflates after he exits.<br />The combat scenes are graphic and intense, and aptly show how the war affects the soldiers in it.<br />The second best scenes (behind Emery's) are the interviews with the Marines for \\"Vietnam: The Movie.\\"  They show the soldiers at their base level: confused, smart alecky, feigning toughness.<br />All in all, this is a great movie, while it isn't Kubrick's best it is worth watching for R. Lee Emery alone.  The rest of the movie is interesting too (but with the intesity levels knocked down a few notches).
0684833395|5.0|Catch22 is the phrase used to describe the ironic paradoxical injustices that all humans must face. This is one of those books that hold a faint prestige for the reader, like upon finishing it, they enter a secret club, the catch22 club! You start to see Clevingers and Milos and Major Major Major's (who happens to be my favourite character!) everywhere. <br />I know some people who think that this book makes the world and humanity ugly, but I think that's just cos the book has opened their eyes to the ironic injustices of the world for the first time. I think it makes the world beautiful, because all the characters, even the slimiest of them, are struggling so hard for what they want against all those ironic injustices, Captain Black to prove Major Major is a communist, Yossarian to get out of the army, Milo to make as much money as possible. And the basic innocence that all these characters have is the only reason why they can do the terrible things they do. Milo getting paid by the germans to bomb his own camp, CHief White Halfoat threatening Flume's life for a joke but causing Flume to live in eternal fear, every man who killed another in WW2, every man who ran the other way in fear for his life. It's a homage to humanity's innocence. The whole book says to me, \\"Look at all the horror and terror we are capable of, yet look at our frailty and stupidity, and beneath it all, a tenacity to keep going.\\" This book doesn't make light of war, it vindicates humanity of war.<br />Anyway of course there are many other aspects to the book, its one of those books that can mean many things to the reader.<br />Also an interesting thing to add, apparently \\"MASH\\" was based on this book. Although MASH is not nearly as dark, it still has many of the bsic themes and foible-filled characters.
B00005ATQ9|4.0|While it is not the best Kubrick film ever made it is an enjoyable film none-the-less.  The 3 hour movie centers around the rise and fall of an 18th century Irish rogue who gambles and marries his way up the social ladder.  While the acting is restrained (but still very good), it is not devoid of passion, it is merely reflecting society at the time.<br />The real star of the show here is the cinematography, the set designs and the costumes.  The film looks so real that it seems that the viewer has stepped into an 18th century painting.<br />While Barry Lyndon isn't as shocking as Full Metal Jacket or Clockwork Orange or as funny as Dr. Strangelove or as weird as 2001; it is still a great, if delibrately paced film with excellent cinematography and sets.
B000092ZYX|4.0|This radiohead album was probably for me the hardest one to get into. I Dont know what it is but at first listen I didnt like it very much. I listned to it again and still I was not satisfied but something hit me for the third time. I still have to continue to listen to it to appreciate it more but I do like what I have heard but It is not their best. There is a lot of diversity on the album. Some simple tunes and others that have the grand production and strange arrangements. But it all works fine and many of the songs are amazing. This is indeed more commercial sounding than its two predecessors and it shows that they perhaps wanted more radio oriented stuff but still it has somewhat avant garde feel to it nevertheless which has always exsisted in every Radioheads release ( except for Pablo Honey). It is however not Ok Computer 2 or the Bends  it is different from that and different from Kid A and Amnesiac. Overall a very good album from a band that is always trying new things and expand their horizons into something new and innovative.
B000092ZYX|3.0|I wanted to like this album i really did, i loved amnesiac and kid a, and of course like everyone else the bends and ok computer.  But this doesnt belong in any of those groups, it doesnt even feel like a new radiohead album. sure sail to the moon and 2+2=5 are great songs, but why not just make a single.  The album is half filler and half songs that hardly make it but for a brief instant.  But thats just my opinion , its still radiohead and i suggest everyone try it, no person feels the same.
B00004XONN|5.0|The first time I listened to this LP I didnt like it much and I didnt listen to it for several months. After I had bought Hail To The Thief and listened to it and was glad about it I decided to listen to Kid A. Kid A is amazing album. Musically and lyrically amazing and is now one of my all time favourite albums. It ranks as my 2nd favourite Radiohead album ( The Bends is the best).
0385504209|3.0|The book is a good conspiracy type story that did keep me interested.  Although, at times I felt that Dan Brown was trying to hard to get his point across, and the characters almost seemed to be preaching at times.  The factual information regarding the life of Jesus that Dan Brown writes about in his book is very controversial to say the least.  For a more accurate portrayal of Christ I would recommend The Case For Christ by Lee Strobel.  There are other controversial subjects Dan Brown touches on such as the interpretation of art and history pertaining to the Holy Grail.  The one thing that I really did enjoy about the book is that much of the action took place in well know places of interest... places that I have not visited, and by reading this book I learned a lot about these places.  I liked it enough that I plan to read some more of his books.
B000089RVX|5.0|I really Liked this Album..My favorites are &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, &quot;My Immortal&quot;, and &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;. I would Really Recommend that you buy it. Thankx for reading.
B000092ZYX|5.0|While some people are willing to categorize Radiohead's albums into their time of release, I believe that Hail to the Thief does not belong in between any albums. This is a masterpiece of it's own right. Combining progressive drum synth techniques and a beautiful melodious combination of guitar and bass, Radiohead has once again sculpted a winner. I consider listening to Radiohead by going on a journey. Beginning at one realm of listening, and taking you to a whole other continent of thought. Thom's voice remains beautiful and the album shows he hasn't lost any of his original haunting bouts of fear and regret for where a corporate world has been led to date. So kick back, close your eyes, press play, and start your spine tingling journey into Radiohead.
B000092ZYY|5.0|In a nutshell, \\"Hail to the Thief\\" blends the experimental spirit of the band's past two albums with the accessibility of their earlier work.<br />Musically, there's something for everybody here.  \\"Go to Sleep\\" and \\"2+2=5\\" (once it kicks in) are straightforward rock songs, and brilliant ones at that.  \\"Backdrifts\\" and \\"The Gloaming\\" are rhythmic, electronic numbers that could've come from the \\"Kid A\\" sessions.  \\"Myxomatosis\\" is based around a thundering, intense bassline.  \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" is a piano dirge with handclaps that manage to be truly creepy.  And so on (I'm not about to describe every track, but trust me, they're all fantastic).<br />In terms of lyrics, the album is extremely cohesive.  Despite its (rather lame) title, it doesn't make any specific political statements, but rather portrays an extreme uneasiness with the current state of the world.  \\"Sail to the Moon\\" and \\"I Will\\" express the desire to escape, while \\"2+2=5\\" and \\"The Gloaming\\" condemn apathy/ignorance, and \\"A Wolf at the Door\\" simply goes nuts with what is apparently stream-of-consciousness ranting.<br />Basically, \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is both one of the most entertaining and one of the most relevant records in recent years.  Some people may fault Radiohead for not pushing the limits of rock music even further (as they have with all past releases), but I'm not one of these people.  They've combined the best aspects of all their past work to create an awesome album in \\"Hail to the Thief,\\" and that sure as hell is good enough for me.<br />Oh, and as for the limited edition version: it's worth the couple of extra dollars.  It gives you a great full-sized poster, and as far as I know, it doesn't lack anything that's included on the standard version (i.e. artwork).  The only downside is that its packaging is closer to the size of a DVD case than a regular jewel case, so it won't fit nicely in your CD rack.
B00005JLPK|4.0|FRIDA has all the ingredients of a spectacular film - magnificent color, innovative visual effects and directorial decisions by Julie Taymor, &quot;names&quot; of some big stars in the business, a powerfuly evocative musical score, and grand swatch of Mexican history as seen through the eyes of the Communists in the first part of the last century. Alfred Molina takes center stage in this FRIDA as a thoroughly well-realized Diego Rivera, and while Salma Hayek has good moments she is restricted by a script which is corny and hackneyed.  The &quot;big names&quot; include Antonio Banderas, Ashley Judd, Geoffrey Rush and Edward Norton - each given literally a few minutes of screen time.  They are good, but the parts (aside from Rush's Trotsky) are so minimal that they could have easily been played by novices.  The beauties of this film are in the visual effects - Frida Kahlo's paintings 'coming alive' or reconstructing from life experiences. And there are moments that are lushly beautiful and touching (the dance between Hayek and Judd for example).  But overall there is a lack of the spirit of Frida Kahlo - a woman unique among artists.  Hayek tries hard, but opts for the beautiful Salma more than the pathetically pained Frida.  The Disc of featurettes is worth your time.  AND  Julie Taymor is definitely a talent to contend with!

B00008LDPU|3.0|What's the deal with the unexplained reference to &quot;the Osiris&quot; in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;?  Or the backstory of the character known only as &quot;Kid&quot;?  How and why did the machines overthrow mankind?  And what about what's happening to the world away from the characters we know from the central movies?  &quot;The Animatrix&quot; answers those questions.<br />There are nine segments in this piece, one CGI and eight mixes of computers and flat-cell animation.  All are done in the style of Japanese &quot;anime,&quot; with everything good (sophisticated story development) and bad (demeaning attitudes toward women) that entails.  Everything is pure backstory--you'll find nothing that changes the course or meaning of what you'll find in the core movies.  And not all of it is necessary.<br />Four segments--&quot;Final Flight of the Osiris,&quot; &quot;The Second Renaissance&quot; 1&amp;2, and &quot;Kid's Story&quot;--dovetail directly into the content of the two movies.  &quot;Kid's Story&quot; features cameo appearances by Keanu Reeves as Neo and Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity.  Moss also reappears as Trinity in &quot;A Detective Story,&quot; which seems to provide some clue as to why Neo recognizes her name the first time they meet.<br />Four other segments--&quot;Program,&quot; &quot;Matriculated,&quot; &quot;World Record,&quot; and &quot;Beyond&quot;--don't actually add anything material to the story.  However, they allow us glimpses into what's going on when the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar isn't looking: a flaw in the Matrix programming, a campaign to convert machines to the human cause, an alternate way to comprehend the reality of the Matrix, and more.  Some of them are interesting, others are self-consciously artistic and verge on incomprehensible.<br />All of the pieces have one thing in common--they're too short for us to immerse ourselves in the content and characters.  In &quot;Final Flight of the Osiris,&quot; we've barely met the characters before they're all dead.  Some are never even given names.  It risks becoming a barrage of free association, especially when each segment is separated from the ones that flank it by a lengthy credit sequence.<br />Still, it makes an adequate diversion, even if it's not as groundbreaking as the live-action movies.  It often seems unnecessary, and probably is, but it's entertaining, and that's what we really want from our anime, isn't it?before they're all dead.  Some are never even given names.

B00000JPYQ|5.0|I love it when there's a live album that truely captures the band in &quot;the day&quot;. This is one of them (other examples of this would be Dire Straits - Live at the BBC, Neil Young - Weld, Pink Floyd - Pulse, and definitely the new Led Zeppelin live album just released - to name a very small few). The bonus tracks are very good and I never really understood the reason for them being excluded from the original. But what matters is that they're included now. <BR>Almost all the performances on this album are excellent, though some are marred by some of the instruments not being at a balanced volume (therefore being &quot;too loud&quot; over the other instruments)...or maybe it's my speakers. Either way, it's not even close enough to ruining this live experience. Great production as well, this is definitely for UFO fans ... or 70s rock fans in general.

B0000025DD|3.0|Though technically this is not Gilmour's debut, but it is his solo debut and I have to say that it's a bit weak. There are 3 stand-out tracks however, that are worth the cheap price ($...); Mihalis, There's No Way Out of Here, and Raise My Rent - excellent fretwork on the latter. Actually, Gilmour's guitarwork is always tasteful and minimalist, as well as his vocals. I wouldn't compare this to Pink Floyd though, only because it doesn't really sound like Pink Floyd (maybe Pink Floyd-lite) - I can see how some people would think that though. I usually like solo albums from \\"highlight band members\\", but this one was a bit of a disappointment.

B00008LDPU|4.0|First off let me say to the guy who wrote the first consumer review, What the heck were you expecting!!!???  the movies only go for around ten minutes each, there is not much room to make an epic storyline out of it.  all of the movies act as suppliments to the matrix and reloaded.  the stories are excellent as each one fills you in on part of the history of the trilogy that was not covered much in the movies.  Renasaunce 1 and 2 give you a brilliant look into how the machines took control of the world and the terrifying horrors that mankind had to face due to his selfish mistakes.  Kids story gives you the accout of how Neo saved the young guy (forgot his name) in reloaded.  all of the animation is different and so gives you a feast for the sences as the stories go from a computer generated master peice to the swirling, tripped out imigry in kid story which is symbolic of the matrixes non-reality.  if you enjoyed the matrix and the rest of the movies this will definately be worth a look, if you haven't seen reloaded yet WATCH THIS! it's basicaly all you need to know before watching the movie to not be confused a certain points.

B000092ZYY|5.0|I'm still really listening to the CD to develop a strong impression, but I thought I'd chime in for those who might be considering picking up the special edition.<br />Essentially, it's about the same width as a regular CD, but its longer -- about a thumb-to-pinky handspan in height, which means it'll stick out (or up) in a CD rack -- but hey, this is the special edition -- we don't care about how it fits in the CD rack, do we?  The packaging has no rigid plastic -- the outer surface is semi-rigid cardboard, so you'll want to be a little careful with it anyway.<br />Holding the album facing you, in your left hand, the &quot;cover&quot; lifts upwards towards you, along its top edge.  The bottom half you'd still be holding in your left hand is a cardboard pouch which holds the CD, with the opening along the top edge.  I'm a little nervous with this making it very easy to scratch the CD, and you have to open the cover all the way to get the CD in and out (which is a little clumsy to accomplish with only two hands in mid-air as you'd do in a typical changeout from your CD player) but it looks nice.<br />The inside of the top/cover is where the goodies really lie.  This cover section opens like a book along its right edge.  The left half (which is inside of the outer surface of the packaging) has a nice ~6 page lyric booklet.  Black and white only, and generally quite spartan in appearance, and yet somehow screaming out classiness.  One note: the lyric booklet is &quot;glued&quot; to the cover with that probably-quite-easy-to-remove glue that they use to attach a new credit card to the stiff-paper mailer they're always mailed in.  I'm not removing mine, but I wouldn't be too surprised if it came off with very little damage if you tried -- of course, you'd never get it back on, so it doesn't seem an advisable thing to do.<br />The right half of the top/cover quite ingeniously folds out to a surprisingly large poster, in a theme quite similar to the colored portion of thefront cover art.  You'll forgive me but I've forgotten how it's attached (and thus whether it is easily/advisably removable).<br />And finally, while I have not bought the regular-edition CD, it does not appear that there are any special songs or content on the special-edition CD -- just packaging.  So it's really up to you whether it's worth it.<br />My opinion was that after their last three albums, Radiohead deserved every dollar (pound?) that I could spare them, so it was an easy choice for me.   <br />Enjoy!  (p.s. &quot;Myxamatosis&quot; is by far my current fave on the new album)
B00005JLIU|4.0|Several years before George Roy Hill directed \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" (1969), \\"The Sting\\" (1973), \\"The Great Waldo Pepper\\" (1975) and \\"The World According to Garp\\" (1982), he directed a lesser-known, lighthearted musical comedy with an all-star cast in 1967 called \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\".  The film is about a single woman named Millie Dillmount (Julie Andrews) living in NYC in the early 1920's in a hotel for \\"young single women\\".  The hotel is managed by an older and strange woman named Mrs. Meers (Beatrice Lillie).  Millie's goal is to find a secretarial job to work for a single man that she will be able to marry.  When Millie's neighbor across the hall in the hotel seemingly moves out unannounced, another young single woman appears to take her place: Miss Dorothy (Mary Tyler Moore).  Claiming that she is an orphan, Miss Dorothy quickly gains unwanted notice from Mrs. Meers, who is involved in some unsavory practices with her two Asian assistants (Jack Soo & Paul Marita).  Shortly thereafter, Millie and Miss Dorothy meet a single and seemingly happy-go-lucky gentleman named Jimmy (James Fox), who takes a liking to Millie; but Millie has her eye on her new boss, Trevor Graydon (John Gavin).  Eventually, Jimmy introduces Millie and Miss Dorothy to a dear friend of his, a wealthy woman who loves to enjoy life named Muzzy (Carol Channing).<br />Not taking itself too seriously, \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\" does have several funny moments that include a bit of slapstick humor.  The acting is not serious, but enjoyable since the film is intended to be lighthearted and a spoof.  As for the songs, my rating (out of 5 stars) for each one in the film is listed below.<br />* \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\" (4.5, sung by Julie Andrews).  Good opener.<BR>* \\"Jimmy\\" (4, sung by Julie Andrews).  A fun song.<BR>* \\"Tapioca\\" (3.5, sung by Julie Andrews).  A silly song.<BR>* \\"Jazz Baby\\" (4, sung by Carol Channing).  One of Carol Channings two songs.<BR>* \\"Jewish Wedding Song\\"(3.5, sung by Julie Andrews).  Seemed out of place and doesn't contribute to the plot.<BR>* \\"Poor Butterfly\\" (3.5, sung by Julie Andrews).  Okay.<BR>* \\"Baby Face\\" (3.5, sung by Julie Andrews).  A more well-known song.<BR>* \\"Do It Again\\" (3.5, sung by Carol Channing).  A silly song for Carol Channing.<br />Overall, I rate \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\" with 4 out of 5 stars.  Fans of Julie Andrews or Carol Channing will more than likely enjoy this film a lot.
B000006045|5.0|I've heard Massive Attack when they first came out years ago, and I didn't follow them since. So I was not really familiar with Mezzanine (except for two tracks). A friend recently recommended 100th Window, so I bought it at Amazon, and I also decided to buy it with Mezzanine. Wow. I was extremely dissapointed with 100th Window, but Mezzanine blew me away! <br />Every track here is interesting! The vocals are wonderful. The whole CD is popping with musical ideas, and it feels fresh and full of energy, unlike the tired and empty 100th Window.
B00006RCOB|4.0|In 1982, while the Cold War was yet raging between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, Clint Eastwood directed and starred in an exciting action film about espionage called \\"Firefox\\".  Clint Eastwood plays Major Mitchell Gant, a retired pilot from the U.S. Air Force who suffers from delayed psychological stress disorder from when he fought in the Vietnam War.  Being the only pilot qualified to fly Soviet Air Force jets who is also fluent in Russian, SIS agent Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) has U.S. AF pilot Capt. Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) recruit Gant to be the primary operative in a U.S.-sponsored espionage mission.  The goal is to steal a technologically superior, top-secret prototype jet fighter that is code-named Firefox out of the Soviet Union.  Gant, of course, is not particularly interested, but returns to Washington with Capt. Buckholz.  There he is given specific training that will enable him to enter the Soviet Union unnoticed.  Once in the Soviet Union, Gant meets a Russian who works for the SIS, Pavel Upenskoy (Warren Clarke).  The Soviet scientists who reluctantly developed the thought-controlled prototype fighter are a Jewish husband and wife team, Dr. Pyotr Baranovich (Nigel Hawthorne) and Natalia (Dimitra Arliss).<br />The film is fraught with tension, drama and excitement as Gant makes his way to infiltrate the Soviet AF base to steal the prototype fighter.  Special effects used in the film were superb for the early 1980's, though some may regard them as being dated by today's standards.  Other memorable characters in the film include Soviet General Vladimirov (Klaus Löwitsch), the Communist Party First Secretary (Stefan Schnabel) and Soviet AF pilot Lt. Col. Voskov (Kai Wulff).<br />The film is not perfect, but with a superb Cold War plot, good dialog, engaging characters and good special effects, I rate \\"Firefox\\" with 4 out of 5 stars.  I am very happy that the film was released on DVD in widescreen format.  Not everyone who watches the film will enjoy it, but technophiles, fans of sci-fi & action films and Clint Eastwood fans more than likely will.
076790592X|3.0|\\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" was certainly touching. Albom has created a fast, mostly-charming, and engaging read, with maybe one too many one-sentence paragraphs used for emphasis. This story caused me to survey my own level of passion and sensitivity. But I also recognize Morrie as a full-fledged anti-capitalist. He believes (and states so) that our (U.S.) economy and culture make people run around feeling threatened. Frankly, I feel he's crossed the line into poppycock at that point. I think the book uses his deathbed lessons as a means to push this political statement. That was disappointing for such a touching story. But I still cried when the old man died.<br />
0452270073|3.0|This first book in Barker's WWI trilogy is based on the real-life treatment of poet Siegfried Sassoon by psychiatrist and anthropologist Dr. William Rivers at Craiglockhart War Hospital.  Sassoon has publicly denounced the war as a \\"senseless slaughter\\" and refuses to fight anymore.  The powers that be assign him to Rivers' care as a victim of \\"shell shock\\" - a traumatic experience that leaves men unable to function.  The hospital's aim is not so much to cure as to return men to active duty - an objective that leaves Rivers conflicted as doctor and a humanitarian.<br />In an era when treatment of mental illnesses was often barbaric, (as in a memorable scene near the book's conclusion), Rivers' treatment plan is to cure with compassion and respect for the patient.  He allows these men the freedom to work through their experiences instead of repressing them.  In doing so, he takes some of their suffering onto himself, and is changed in the process.  The give and take between doctor and patient is the real meat of the story.<br />But beyond the plot, there's a lot to think about in this novel.  In fact, the real genius of this work is not the plot or the characters or the setting, but rather the seemingly endless array of serious ethical questions that crop up as these men struggle with their situations.  Was Britain justified in going to war against Germany?  Can war ever be moral?  Who is responsible for the actions of nations?  Do soldiers abdicate their moral responsibilities when they don the uniform?  How can a doctor cure a patient's infirmity only to send him back to the front lines to die?  How does this apply to conscientious objectors?  Is it enough to treat symptoms when the underlying causes are psychological?  Barker doesn't provide answers, but wants us to look for them in ourselves.<br />This would be a terrific book for teaching an ethical philosophy course, and surely that's why this novel is so highly praised by reviewers.  However, as an entertainment, this book is substantially less successful.  One patient's brief dalliance with a factory girl provides almost our only glimpse of a woman, and even this episode seems tacked on, and is decidedly unromantic.  And as one might expect, there is absolutely no trace of humor in this book at all - no one ever cracks a smile, let alone a joke.  Less predictably, there's very little action in this book, either.  The patients' tales of horrors at the front are powerful enough, but rarely run more than a page or two, and we don't get many of those.  So while this is indeed a brilliant work of fiction, it should only be recommended to those who are deeply into ethical philosophy.nt, this book is substantially less successful.

B00005B36H|3.0|I am sure that I will get some backlash for saying this, but I didn't really care for this album much.  I mean it was okay, but something just seemed to be missing from it.  <br />I am a huge fan of Tool.  Aenima is one of my favorite albums of all time.  Lateralus just seems like a collection of Aenima B-sides though.  <br />Every time that I try listening to this album I end up skipping around to various tracks then put Aenima back in the player.  Honestly, who out there has listened to this album more than Aenima?  Hmm...let me rephrase that...who out there has listened to this album more than Aenima sober (get the little Tool humour there)?  <br />Now I am not saying that this album is a bad album or anything, but Tool did set the bar fairly high with their previous releases.  So high that it will take more than Lateralus to leap the bar.  Most people usually complain when a band changes their sound.  I say it doesn't matter if a band changes their sound as long as they still make good music.  Tool hasn't really changed their sound much.  They have just written some truly exceptional music in the past, and I honestly don't feel like they written songs as well as they have in the past.  <br />I really wanted to like this album as much as I did the past tool albums, but alas, I could not.<br />Let he who has listened to Lateralus more than Aenima throw the first stone.
B000069AUI|4.0|The first time I heard the album, songs like \\"Polotik\\" and \\"Clocks\\" really stood out and were intoxicating. Nearly all of the songs on \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" are like this. The lyrics are intelligent and the sound is an creative and beautiful. <BR>The only turn-off for some people may be the repetitive instrumental aspects of a few of the pieces. Though the chords played throughout are well manufactured and run together well, some music fans may be used to a little more variety.<BR>The people I know that have bought this album are fans of Radiohead, The Cure, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Elliot Smith. If an artist is good, the task of comparing that artist to other should be difficult. I have found this to be true with Coldplay. Though the influences are there, the band has successfully found a sound all their own.<BR>I can only give this album a four because I'm spoiled rotten and have had the opportunity to listen to the world's greatest music...In the long run, Coldplay may be one of the greatest bands in music history. Can't wait to buy their next album.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I truly respect Jack White.  I don't think anyone else would have the guts to make make an album with ancient equipment after being on MTV.  Yet he and his sister (or is it wife...who knows) did and they still remain cultural icons.  <br />The best way to describe this album is for you to think of old records playing country and blues with a touch of old rock and roll mixed in.  Then throw in a guitar with distortion.  Do you have that in your head?  Good.  That is what Elephant is.  It has the sound of old music with distorted guitar, but that isn't what makes it, or any White Stripes album a good album.  What makes it a good album is Jack White's song writing ability.  <br />This album has some truly remarkable songs on it.  There are a couple of tracks that seem to be filler though, almost like remakes of past White Stripes songs.  For that, I can't in good concious give it a full five stars.  Although, the songs that do rock (around 95% of them) are good enough to deserve at least a listen if not a full-blown purchase.  That special 95% are catchy enough to get stuck in your head and toe-tapping enough to reserve a place in any CD player (except for maybe the people that buy American Idol discs and proclaim Clay Aikens as God).
6305165912|5.0|Don't try to read too deeply within the plotline of this movie.  Don't try to analize the characters and their relevance.  This movie was made to be just plain fun.  Jeff Bridges probably gives his best  performance since RANCHO DELUXE as The Dude an unemployed ex war demonstrator who happens to excel in the SoCal Bowling league.  Even though we never see him roll a ball.  John Goodman plays his 'friend' Walter, a war veteran who justifies his every arguement with the fact that he 'watched his buddies die face down in the muck in Vietnam!' He rails against Dude for using the term 'Chinamen' as being politically incorrect, but then goes off about the German bowling scheduler Burkholter.  Everythings a wonderful contradiction with this guy.  Throw in Walters' poor sidekick Donnie(Steve Buscemi)and you have a completeley inane bowling team of the blind leading the blind.  <BR>The storyline is The Dude gets mistaken for Jeffrey Lebowski a wealthy achiever whos wife owes money to smut producer Jackey Treehorn.  From this premise we are treated to a plethora of wacky characters...Maude, the Big Lebowskis' sister known for her feministic art; the German punk band AUTOBHAN also known as the belivers of nothing who claim to have kidnapped the Big Lebowskis' wife and are sending body parts until the ransom is paid; and the scene stealing Jesus (John Torturo)a competing bowler who besides being a pederast \\"can really roll man\\"; the above mentioned Jackey Treehorn who can mix a mean caucasion and has heard all those kidnapping stories, \\"so just save it\\".  He just wants the money owed to him by Mrs. Lebowski.  This leads to an encounter with the Malibu chief of police and an Eagles playing cab driver.  A 'fellow private dick' working for the Knutesens.<BR>Add to this a narrator who shows up a time or two on camera as 'The Stranger'and you can't help but ask 'why?'.  Answer:  Don't ask.  <BR>It's just plain fun.
B00008RH3L|5.0|I waited and waited until this &quot;great Coen Brothers&quot; film came out on DVD...... it was worth the wait. Next to Godfather I and II there's no better way to spend an evening with crime. The acting is superb, the photography breathless and the total feel of the movie will satisfy all fans of this genre. And, if you never saw it or dismissed it .... here's your second chance to be enthralled. Gabriel, John and Albert will take you to another place - a place that will send a &quot;Godfather chill&quot; up your spine. Mark my words.
B00008VGL6|2.0|OK.......so I had told my self that I would not buy this album due to all the bad reviews that has been reading about online, but did I listen !!!! NOPE.<BR> <BR>I went ahead and ordered this CD cause I was not privileged enough to hear it online like most folks did (thank god that I was lucky enough to hear Dave's before dropping cash on it).<BR> <BR>So !!! Sorry for being so late on this review as a result...<BR> <BR>Martin has always been my favorite and since he is the brain behind DM, I figured that Dave's project ... should not be a big surprise and maybe Martin's wont be too bad, especially since I really liked the first Counterfeit.<BR> <BR>I had downloaded the original songs and listened to them first, so I would not be too disappointed in the album and set the bar kind of low.  Did it help you ask??? NOPE<BR>In-fact, it made it worse for me since I thought that the originals sounded a lot better than about half of the covers.<BR> <BR>What happened to martin's voice???? Its not him at all.  Where is the high and low pitches that we all have come to love of this man??? Its not here, that for sure..<BR> <BR>The worst is not that his voice is not all there....its the MUSIC.  On the first Counterfeit album,  I thought that Martin did a fantastic job with those songs and really brought them to life both with his soothing voice and with his great musical ability.<BR> <BR>This album has terrible music.  It actually kind of reminds me of the EXCITER album at times....but even much similar than that.  The music sounds practically the same in all of the covers with little variations if any at all, and it seems like he used a cheap computer software to make it.<BR> <BR>After getting two very disappointing albums from members of one of the greatest synthpop acts of our time, I have to say that it is defiantly time for these guys to call it quits before putting out another album that could be far worse than Exciter.<BR> <BR>My damn two cents....
B00006AW2G|5.0|Released way back in 1969, &quot;Let it Bleed&quot; finds The Rolling Stones at their absolute creative peak.  Though it was released as part of a string of masterpiece albums the band recorded between 1968 and 1972, the argument can be made that &quot;Bleed&quot; stands ever so slightly above the rest.  The Stones' countryfied rock has never sounded better, and is a major source of inspiration to today's &quot;alt. country&quot; movement.<br />The album would be worthwhile even if all it contains was thier  best &quot;epic&quot; song, &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want.&quot;  But in addition are the other two monster hits: &quot;Gimmie Shelter&quot; and &quot;Midnight Rambler.&quot;  The title track rocks gently, while &quot;Country Honk&quot; is a teriffic reworking of &quot;Honky Tonk Girls.&quot;  Even one of the lesser known tracks, &quot;Monkey Man,&quot; was used with tremendous effect by Director Martin Scorsese in the movie &quot;Goodfellas.&quot;  The digitally remastered CD provides particular sonic clarity, making the album sound as if it was just recorded last week.<br />Overall, an absolute masterpiece that is one of the many highlights of the Stones' career.
B000063DFN|5.0|This is the finest peice of Metal art the boys in Maiden ever released.  From the opening track of \\"Aces High\\", to the 14+ minute masterpiece of \\"Flight Of The Ancient Mariner\\", this album kicks [rear-end]and takes names!<br />1. \\"Aces High\\"  One of the most melodic, yet [rear] kicking songs on the album!

B00005ATQM|5.0|This is a great album to begin with. Now that it has been remixed for 5.1 DVD audio it is even better...<br />To get the true sound of DVD audio you need a DVD player that has built in dolby and DTS decoder. But you still get awesome sound with a regualr DVD player. <br />This has been mixed so almost only vocal appear in the center channel, and guitar and orechtra type stuff in the rear speakers. Many songs have James backup vocals that come out of the rear speakers as if he were in the room with you. Many of Kirks Guitar solos and lead riffs move around the room through the speakers. Its totally awesome.
B00005JM1F|2.0|It starts off okay, but the laughs are too far and inbetween. Will Farell is okay, but he starts to get annoying about halfway through. Luke Wilson is really good in quirky roles, but he fails miserably as the straight man here. Vince Vaughn is great as always, but he can't save it. Rent this one.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I'm not the craziest Led Zeppelin fan, but I've always liked their music.  Now I'm inching closer to being a crazy fan.  This is an awesome DVD, made even more so by having great audio choices.  The video is very good considering most of it was shot around 25 years ago.<br />If you have a good home theater setup this will knock your socks off!
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is an amazing movie. The sub is fantastic and the dub is just as good! A great movie for all ages.
B00006IR5S|5.0|I love this soundtrack! And I thought it was a lot better than Sorcerer's Stone. The best songs on the c.d. are &quot;The Prologue, Fawkes the Phoenix, The Chamber of Secrets, The Flying Car, Dobby the House elf, The Spiders, Dueling the Basilisk, and Harry's Wonderous World.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The Prologue&quot; is kind of like a mix of a lot of songs off of Sorcerer's Stone put together.<br />&quot;Fawkes the Phoenix&quot; is easily the most beautiful song off the soundtrack. It starts out really soft and then builds and builds.<br />&quot;The Chamber of Secrets&quot; is the darkest song. It seems to let you know that this movie is a lot darker. And I liked how they did this spooky part on the organ, it was great.<br />&quot;The Flying Car&quot; is most fun to listen too. I love this song!<br />&quot;Dobby the House Elf&quot; sounds very Dobby-ish. And like &quot;Fawkes and the Phoenix,&quot; this song starts out soft and then builds as it goes on.<br />&quot;The Spiders&quot; is so cool! You can really imagine spiders crawling along when you listen to this song.<br />&quot;Dueling the Basilisk&quot; is my favorite out of the  whole soundtrack. It's really action packed and it's really fun to listen to.<br />&quot;Harry's Wonderous World&quot; is also on the first soundtrack, but this song is kind of different on the second soundtrack. It sounds better.<br />Overall... this is a great soundtrack and you should buy it!
B000002IOW|2.0|As a long time Rush fan I hate to say negative about the band.  However to give this a five star rating and talk about how wonderful it is would be a major fib.  Except for The Pass, which is a wonderful song, Presto is a collection of forgettable tunes by a talented band.  Like all albums before and since, Presto does display impressive musicianship on behalf of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart.  The problem here is the songwriting and compostions.  The album starts off interesting enough with Neil tapping and then a bombastic intro to Show Don't Tell.  Then Geddy starts singing.  The problem is what he is singing about.  A song about cynicsm.  If you want cynism check out any of the works by Pink Floyd or Roger Waters.  Superconductor is a nice rocker but it's chorus is hideous.  The major problem is the sound.  This album sounds to polished.  It's at the opposite end of the spectrum from Vapor Trails, which sounds too raw.  The band sounds best when it finds a nice balance with producers such as Terry Brown or Peter Collins.  Rush is capable of much more than this.
B00005OWEG|4.0|One advantage to being perhaps the last person on Earth to see any version of APOCALYPSE NOW is that I can compare it to more recent war epics from a perspective almost 30 years distant from the Vietnam era.<br />At this late date, a synopsis of the plot is so redundant as to be almost silly. So, I'll make it a two-sentence snippet. During the Vietnam War, Army Captain Ben Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered to seek out and terminate with prejudice Green Beret Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who's gone rogue and set himself up as a minor warlord across the border in Cambodia. To reach the colonel's encampment, Willard must travel far upriver on a Navy patrol boat.<br /><br />The essence and artistic merit of APOCALYPSE NOW are embodied in its surrealism. The premise is that the war is unreal even in Saigon, and becomes only more irrational the closer one gets to the margins of the conflict until, in Kurtz's camp, all contact with reality is lost. The fascination of the film is observing through Willard's eyes the gradient of madness the further upriver he travels. For me, the elegance of the story was in the journey, not the arrival.<br />Not having seen the original release, another exercise afforded to me by the this \\"redux\\" version was to guess which 49 minutes had been added, i.e. edited out of the original. I suspect they included the lengthy (sometimes unintelligible) sequence at the French plantation in Cambodia, and the, um, interlude with the Playboy Bunnies in their stranded helicopter. Both of these interrupted the flow of the plot like large boulders in a river. They are best left on the cutting room floor.<br />APOCALYPSE NOW is, of course, an anti-war film that focused on the Vietnam conflict. (With the exception of John Wayne's embarrassingly gung-ho THE GREEN BERETS, I can't think of any movie that has given the Vietnam fiasco a favorable slant. Even Mel Gibson's WE WERE SOLDIERS, while depicting an American triumph of sorts, stopped short of feeling good about our Asian misadventure.) But as an anti-war exercise in a more general sense, how does APOCALYPSE NOW stand up to, say, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, DAS BOOT, BLACKHAWK DOWN, or BAND OF BROTHERS - four of the very best combat films in my memory? While the impact of APOCALYPSE NOW resides in its surrealism, that of the more recent four is in their awful realism. DAS BOOT has the added advantage of a perspective from the side opposite the victors', which demonstrates the fact that war's horrors are universal regardless of which trench you're in. Personally, I think that realism is a more powerful instructive tool, and would be less apt to recommend APOCALYPSE NOW for that reason. But it is mesmerizing to watch.ng good about our Asian misadventure.)

B000002IWQ|4.0|The first time I heard this CD I found myself in a state of shock.  For the first time since Grace Under Pressure ten years earlier Rush learned how to rock again.  On their fifteenth studio CD Rush had not run out of things to write about.  This time the running theme is duality.  This topic is covered in songs such as Animate, Cold Fire, Alien Shore.  The lead single Stick It Out begins with an ugly (in a good way) Sabbathesque riff.  A personal highlight for me this time is Between Sun and Moon.  Goofy lyrics but a wonderful riff.  I was pleased to finally hear that on the bands last tour.  Two songs could have been left off to make this a perfect CD.  Those songs would be The Speed Of Love, a pointless song that goes nowhere.  The other being Everyday Glory which sounds like it would have fit better on the Presto CD.  Oh, and let's not forget Cut To The Chase.  The solo is short but one of Alex's best.
B000002UJQ|2.0|Thom Yorke's incessant whining and moaning prevent me from enjoying this album.  I like the slick production and neat guitar tricks, but the singer just doesn't know when to shut up and let the music speak.  I enjoyed the first couple of Radiohead CDs, but I do believe Mr. Yorke has fallen victim to the same syndrome that ruined Bono and that big-lipped what's-his-name guy from The Verve.  Yorke is obviously in love with his voice and so we must all suffer the non-stop groaning.  Too bad, because there's some half-decent music on here. Maybe I just don't feel sorry enough for myself to get into this. Get The &quot;Pop is Dead&quot; single if you prefer your rock with some backbone.  Or, you could just get The Pixies.
B000092ZYX|5.0|You think what can they do , how can they find another path to explore... AND THEY DO!!!...<BR>God Bless them... They need to be Knighted...Sir Thom Yorke.<br />I have to still hear it more to be able to judge each song and assign it the right rating, but overall SENSATIONAL...<br />Thank You is all i can say...<BR>Sit back and Enjoy you will love it.
B000089RVX|2.0|This band has made a very good attempt at the moody goth feel they put out. This band is definately not a new style since there are plenty of European bands that use a similar set up. The band seems to have a lot of influences from the Italian band Lacuna Coil, which I highly recomend to anyone that likes this band. Overall the band did ok, but I reccomend trying out Lacuna Coil.
B000089RVX|4.0|I have read the other reviews...to those who say Evanescence cannot write: that is sadly incorrect.<BR>To those who question Amy's voice quailty outside of the studio: I just saw them in concert last night and she is terrific!<br />Evanescence has great music that is not even on this CD yet so stay tuned!  The new release &quot;Fallen&quot; has polished versions of their music and it is definitely enjoyable.  <br />I agree this is not linkin park-style music, but it's also not quite goth either.  It's rock (Ask Amy herself!)  <br />Yes, there is more to music than head-bobbing and the voice...listen to this CD and you will hear plenty beneath the surface!
B000063UR2|5.0|I have loved this movie ever since i was a kid. and now that i have gotten this ultimate dvd, it is even better when i'm all grown up. I think this movie catches that virtue of the unicorn, in which is one of my most loved creatures in the world. Therefore, I believe that &quot;Legend&quot; was and very much still is my favorite movie ever.
B000093BDX|4.0|Finally, Finally, the best of &quot;The Brother Years&quot; is combined with all time classics at Capitol. The sound Quality on this CD great, these Vintage tracks come alive. Value wise, 30 tracks total and Sound quality wise this CD beats all other collections. However, I must agree with the reviewer below why is &quot;Good Timin&quot; included and not &quot;The Warmth of the Sun&quot; and why not include &quot;All Summer Long&quot; instead of &quot;Come Go with Me&quot;, the old Del-Viking hit, after all this CD is about Summer. How about &quot;Surf's Up instead of &quot;Darlin&quot;. I was so distraught over &quot;The Warmth of the Sun&quot; not being included on this CD I sent my wife out to get me a CD with this song on it. This CD puts a big dent in the Beach Boys catalogue but if you want all the classics you'll have to buy another CD or two in addition to  this Quality CD I have had the &quot;Thirty Years&quot; box set as well as all the orginal albums on CD and this CD and some other &quot;Greatest Hits package to include the 5 or 6 tunes that are not on this CD is the way to go.
B000002H97|5.0|This in my view was the last great metallica album.  It is my third fav. by metallica (behind 'and justice for all' and 'kill em all').  There isnt a bad track on the album, it is all heavy bone crushing thrash metal, (too bad it didnt stay that way) \m/ great album
B00000JQFM|5.0|This cd deserves 5 stars just for the sheer thought put into writing this material, the music does the talking for each song which i feel can at times be stronger than words so buy this classic album.
B000002JNJ|4.0|though this album isnt a super cd , but pantera has so much damn energy, that alone makes this a good album that i really got into.
B000069AUI|4.0|It seemed to me that all the songs on the radio by Coldplay were slow and really seemed to focus on lyrics rather than the overall music.  So the first song came out and I wasn't blown away.  But when I heard &quot;Clocks&quot;, something just clicked.  So I listened.  There are no songs that make you hit the skip button, and it's easy listening.  I had one of their earlier albums, and you can see how they have progressed musically.  I think that one day, this will be the album that pushed them over the top - kind of like Radiohead with &quot;The Bends&quot;.  It won't be their best, but it pointed them in the right direction.
B00005JKJA|1.0|It is seldom that I don't finish watching a movie even if I'm not enjoying it. I try to stay with it until the end,and a number of times I have been happy that I did. Mulholland Drive was so slow and boring that it was impossible to stay with it. This movie was everything that is wrong with film making; an incomprehensible plot, characters that you don't care about, actors walking through the role making it painfully clear they're just in the movie for a paycheck.  <br />The best words I can use to describe this movie are pretentious babble. Don't waste your time.  If you want a solid, well-acted, intelligent film noir, purchase &quot;The Man Who Wasn't There&quot; instead.
B000092ZYY|5.0|In the past ten years, it seems that Radiohead has evolved after just six albums more than bands who have been around for three times that long. \\"Hail To The Thief\\" is a step forward for Radiohead, as well as a revisitation of previous material. The first single, 'There There' sounds a bit like 'Optimistic' from 'Kid A' with a little more guitar, while 'Sail To The Moon' is reminiscient of 'Pyramid Song' from 'Amnesiac,' with its slow, sad piano melody. The opener, '2 + 2 = 5' is certainly very much like an OK Computer-era track with its heavy guitar ending. With its similar styles, songs like the industrial, bass-heavy 'Myxomatosis' and the eerie 'We Suck Young Blood' with deranged, gospelesque hand claps, add new sounds to the Radiohead canon altogether. Overall, the album merges the electronic elements of 'Kid A' with the guitars of 'OK Computer' (nowhere near as guitar-heavy as 'The Bends' or 'Pablo Honey' however) and adds an array of new sounds to the mix. The album is not quite as accessible or ear-friendly as 'The Bends' or even most of 'OK Computer' but is definitely more melodic than 'Amnesiac'.<br />** On a side note, the Special Edition packaging is a bit flimsy and easy to tear or bend. Since there are no extra musical features on the Special Edition, no bonus discs or enhancements, it might be in one's best interests to buy the standard packaging and save a few dollars.
0440224764|4.0|Though the book was a bit predictable, I liked the writing style and the simplicity of it and loved the plot.  I always learn something more about the legal profession when reading Grisham's books.  However, he doesn't provide enough character development about co-leading good-guy characters (Eva, Sandy).  The way Patrick got out of all his legal troubles was not very realistic but fascinating escapist fare nonetheless.  The ending seemed as though he couldn't come up with something better or couldn't decide how to end the story, so with no clues whatsoever along the way, he severed the story abruptly before it was due to end.  A clue or two along the way would have made the same ending satisfying and believable, but to have a character suddenly become a totally different person in the last two pages of a book or else to have the character disappear altogether left me feeling duped and pissed off at the author for his lack of planning and feeling like he didn't really do his job all that well after all.  With all the thought that went into this book to set up the elaborate plot, I think Grisham could have put a bit more thought into either creating a believable ending or leaving clues along the way.  I don't think any reader likes to be 2x4'd at the end of an enjoyable book, which is what the lack of clues makes this out to be.
B00008PC2O|4.0|The Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2 was (and still is) an epic achievement among DVDs releases, with great picture, multiple versions of the film, and an almost dizzying number of special achievements.<br />So why mess with a good thing?<br />Besides the blatant attempt to create a tie-in to Terminator 3, the new &quot;Extreme DVD&quot; has some different special features (which is similar to squeezing an already crushed orange for juice), improved picture (most noticeable on regular TVs in that the &quot;shadow bars&quot; surrounding the actual widescreen picture inherent to many Artisan releases is missing), and a commentary by James Cameron.<br />Granted, the improved picture and commentary are nice (particularly for the discussion of the scenes omitted from the Theatrical Version), but it's not particularly worth it if you have the Ultimate Edition (unless you have a DVD-ROM drive). Throw in a somewhat difficult package (I personally managed to nearly destroy the inner case's label when first pulling it out of the metal outer casing), and you've got a release that requires some thought before purchasing if you have the Ultimate Edition already, or can easily find it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|this album is a great halt for the directions in which radiohead was heading. there is an obvious but quite scattered structure to the album, and thom's voice sounds fresh (a drunk punch up at a wedding, etc.) i'd say it's a classic, ok to file with the others. 5 stars.
B000092ZYY|5.0|here it goes.....<BR>this cd changes radiohead for me. i believe that their other cds are deep but this one is by far the most meaningful. Because these songs deal with things that i as a regular person encounters, the songs deal with our emperial country (USA), the horrors in L.A. and the vices, and it ranges anywhere even to 9/11. ...RADIOHEAD is music at its finest and this cd is just that. i apreciate \\"there there\\" but it is not the greatest song on the cd.<br />THIS A CD FOR FANS OF GOOD MUSIC THAT LISTEN TO LYRICS. like every readiohead fan should.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Hail to the Thief instantly became my favorite Radiohead effort, and I've been a Radiohead fan for four years now.  Kid A and Amnesiac both had twisted machinery sound and the melody was often sacrificed for instrumental sounds; Radiohead succeed on creating a new sound in music, but the tone was dark - and darker in Amnesiac.  While Hail to the Thief still has their unique machinery sound and dark tone, it combines it with their earlier acoustic voice of The Bends.  (Radiohead themselves call it \\"dark pop.\\")  The result is an instant masterpiece.  The music may sound depressing, but the lyrics say otherwise. <br />A lot of people consider Kid A and Amnesiac `art,' but don't like listening to it, but this album not only proves itself to be a piece of art, but also incredibly enjoyable to listen to.  I've been listening to the Doors, Bob Dylan, Stone Temple Pilot, Led Zeppelin the past few days, and Radiohead just stands right next to these legendary artists.  I would recommend this album to anyone, Radiohead fan or not.
0440237688|4.0|I really liked this book! There was a few proubles with it though. I recomend this book for people how like an ending that dosn't tell what happenes to the charters. I think that the author should have told us me of what happened in the end. Another prouble with the book is that it has a lot of counter dictions. It say they don't have guns, but a few pages later they do. <br /> I think it was not as rewarding at the end of the book. I still will recomend the book, becuse it has a lot of good twist in it. As I said it is a page turner!! I think most of the book is pretty good!
B000005L86|5.0|What do we have here? The sublime vocal harmonies of the Congos, their great songs, the great musicians, and the magical sounds and otherworldly ambiance of Lee Perry's Black Ark Studio at its peak. What more could this listener want?
B000089RVX|5.0|Amy's voice gives me goosebumps everytime I hear it. The haunting feel it gives is off is one of a kind, and very superior compared to vocalists out there today. Her voice is both chilling and reassuring at the same time. I would have to say, that this CD should be bought because of her voice ALONE; although the songs are just as impressive and memorable.
B00006G8HX|4.0|After the success of Nicholas Meyer's Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, it soon became apparent that the Trek franchise could continue, with or without Spock.  Despite rumors to the contrary, Leonard Nimoy had never stipulated in his contract for Star Trek II that Spock be killed off.  According to Nimoy (as revealed in  a \\"the making of\\" featurette), the actor really did think that the second film would be the finale of the Star Trek movies, so why not have Spock go out in a blaze of glory?<br />However, even before production ended on The Wrath of Khan, Nimoy and producer Harve Bennett decided that \\"there were always possibilities\\" for the future, both for the franchise and Spock.<br />Thus it came to pass that Star Trek III: The Search for Spock had its, pun intended, genesis.  With a subtle scene here and a more upbeat ending there, several plot strands were left unresolved....what did Spock mean when he gave Dr. McCoy a mind meld with the word \\"Remember?\\"  Why was he left on the Genesis Planet?  Those two scenes, coupled with Nimoy reciting \\"Space: The Final Frontier\\" at the end of the second movie practically screamed \\"Sequel Ahead!\\"<br />As it happened, Star Trek III would also mark Nimoy's feature-film directorial debut.  Although he was given a modest budget - which does, unfortunately, become obvious in many scenes - Nimoy fared fairly well his first time out as a director.<br />As in the movie that follows (The Voyage Home), Bennett and Nimoy give us a mix of adventure, suspense and even moments of comedy in the continuation of a three-movie story arc.<br />The setup is simple.  After the events depicted in Star Trek II, the USS Enterprise has been ordered back to Earth.  Spock is dead, the Enterprise's trainee crew has been reassigned, and Starfleet has quarantined the Genesis planet.  Only a science vessel, USS Grissom, has been assigned to survey the forbidden world.<br />Little does the Federation know, however, that the Klingons have found out about the Genesis device. Fearing that the Federation has plans to destroy the Klingon Empire, Commander Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) is determined to obtain its secrets.<br />At the same time, upon his return to Earth Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) discovers that Spock has somehow placed his \\"katra\\" in Dr. McCoy's (the late DeForest Kelley) body.  Kirk is urged by Sarek, Spock's father (the late Mark Lenard) to retrieve Spock's remains from the Genesis planet.  After that, Kirk is to go to Vulcan with McCoy and Spock's body, where both of his friends will \\"find peace.\\"<br />When Kirk requests permission to take the soon-to-be retired Enterprise back to Genesis to retrieve Spock's body, Starfleet Command refuses, saying that the science ship (where Lt. Saavik and Kirk's son David Marcus are now serving) is the only ship allowed by the Federation to investigate.  As usual, Kirk takes matters into his own hands and, assembling most of his bridge crew, steals the Enterprise and warps off to Genesis, setting up a sequence of events that Kirk will find to be more costly than he bargained for.<br />The Collector's Edition DVD set, unlike the previous two Director's Editions, has no added scenes or director's cut version.  The theatrical version of the film (with a running time shy of two hours) is featured here with director's audio commentary by Nimoy and text commentary by Michael Okuda.  The movie will delight some Trek fans, satisfy most fans, and disappoint others.  (This being an odd-numbered film, it seems to prove the theory that even numbered Treks are great, while odd-numbered ones are either just okay or just plain bad!)

B00000099Y|5.0|Even if you don't like Tool, you have to experience this album at least once. It has you lying back thinking, \\"Well, I've never thought about it that way before...\\". Maynard lyrics and vocals memorize you into a state of awe and amazement with songs about things you never even thought of. Adams Jones' crunching guitars spill through your speakers and break the frames of what you thought you knew. Who knew a 90's guitarist could sound so good? Danny Careys rhythms keep you in wonder as you try to catch up to every note he plays. This album is perfection to the highest degree. A great opening track, \\"Stinkfist\\" will keep your toes tapping and your body moving and as moves into other tracks, such as the angry \\"Hooker with a Penis\\" and the memorizing \\"Jimmy\\". \\"Third Eye\\", the closing track, leaves you ready to listen again, with Tools potential going all out through the wires into your head and BAM! They kicked it up another notch. Overall, everything you knew was recreated with this album. Buy it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|The new Radiohead album is, in my opinion, the band's best effort since 1997's OK computer.  While the album is similar to OK Computer, it retains many elements from The Bends, Kid A, and Amnesiac.  The album opens with &quot;2+2=5,&quot; AKA &quot;The Lukewarm,&quot; one of the album's strongest tracks.  The following track, &quot;Sit Down. Stand Up,&quot; is probably the album's weakest point.  &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot; is a close relative of 1997's &quot;The Tourist.&quot;  &quot;Backdrifts&quot; juxtaposes the electronica of Kid A and the deep songwriting of OK Computer and The Bends.  The song &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; sounds like it could have easily been featured on The Bends.  &quot;There There,&quot; the album's first single, is one of the best Radiohead tracks of all time.  The album ends on its highest note with the altogether wonderful &quot;A Wolf at the Door.&quot;  Overall, this is the album that fans of OK Computer have been waiting for, although it is not exactly the &quot;return to rock&quot; that the band promised.  If you are a fan of Radiohead, Hail to the Thief will not disappoint.
B000092ZYY|5.0|In anticipation to this album's release, many people hailed it as the return to guitars or even &quot;Ok Computer 2&quot;, but is that really a good thing? Sure The Bends was a great album and has stood the test of time so far, and Ok Computer was pure brilliance, but Radiohead have matured so much since then. Kid A and Amnesiac were considered experimental or &quot;weird for the sake of weird.&quot; In actuality they were skillfully orchestrated, beautiful albums. For some they may have taken a few listens to fully appreciate, but nobody I know has been dissappointed after giving them a truly open mind. Radiohead are able to use unconventional methods to create unique music that is ages beyond any band around today. I recommend this album as their best yet. Yes it is better than Ok Computer. Yes it is better than Kid A. Thom's singing is hair-raisingly beautiful (and his best yet), Phil's percussion has never been more impressive, Colin plays some of the funkiest bass lines they have ever written, Ed continues to impress with the endless amounts of beautiful soundscapes and fills, and Jonny is near Godliness with all of his musical performances. The band recorded this album in a much more stress-free and happy manner than any of their previous albums and it shows. I, for one, am very happy that the band is not returning to their &quot;roots&quot;, and is continuing to get better and better as time goes on. Hail to The Thief has only been in stores for two days and I can safely say that it is my favorite album of all time.
B000056IKU|5.0|After the relatively large success of their first album in Germany, Neu! members Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger returned to the studio with engineer Conny Plank to recorded their second album. &quot;Neu! 2&quot; starts out as a continuation of the first album. The 11-minute opening track &quot;Fur Immer&quot; is a beefier heavier take on &quot;Hallogallo&quot; from the first album. Klaus Dinger's drumbeat stays locked in place while Michael Rother's guitar swims and swerves around a stationary E-major chord. This is a fine piece of minimalist-rock. The following piece, &quot;Spitzenqualitat&quot;, focuses on &quot;Fur Immer's&quot; driving drumbeat which gradually slows down until it stops. While this is going on, various echo and electronic effects weave through the drum rhythm. This leads directly into &quot;Gedenkminute&quot; which is a full minute of wind sounds and a church bell tolling. &quot;Lila Engel&quot; closes the first half of the album with Klaus Dinger's driving drums and moaning vocals.<br />The second half of the album is where everything shifts drastically. Legend has it that while Neu! was in the middle of recording this album, they discovered that their recording budget had run out and had to finish everything in a huge rush. For this part of the album, Rother and Dinger used an early single as the basis for manipulating and stretching the music into one side of an LP. So what we have here is two tracks, &quot;Neuschnee&quot; and &quot;Super&quot; included in their original versions as well as the tracks being played back at 16 and 78 RPM. Also included is two-minutes worth a cassette being eaten in a tapedeck (&quot;Cassetto&quot;) and roughly four-minutes worth of &quot;Neuschnee&quot; being played at various speeds while Dinger, Rother and engineer Conny Plank have a conversation in the recording studio (&quot;Hallo Excentrico&quot;). The second half of &quot;Neu! 2&quot; is basically an early example of what was to become known as the remix. It's interesting hearing how these two simple tracks could be turned into an adventerous sound collage.<br />Like the first album, &quot;Neu! 2&quot; would go on to be influential to many artists in many different genres from punk to art-rock to techno. This album continues to be a timeless classic and is a highly recommended piece of German Krautrock at its very best.It's interesting hearing how these two simple tracks could be turned into an adventerous sound collage. <BR>Like the first album, &quot;Neu! 2&quot; would go on to be influential to many artists in many different genres from punk to art-rock to techno.

B00008977N|4.0|This has been out on LD and VHS for years, but finally we get a DVD version of this excellent concert.  The video quality itself could be better, I have many concert DVD's and they're not nearly as grainy, but they have much better cameras now so hopefully the DVD of the Growing Up tour will look better.<br />The set list is the same as the double Secret World Live CD with excellent back-up vocals by Paula Cole.  It's great to see her here before she was known to the world or even had an album.  Peter Gabriel's always been a fantastic performer and does not dissapoint.<br />Extras include a fun time-lapse of the whole setting up of the stage through breaking it down, as well as an interesting documentary.
B0000028UK|5.0|First off, Ten was a classic.  One of the definitive 90's grunge albums.  However, I can't stand to listen to Ten anymore.  Maybe I played it too much and got tired of it.  Vs. is much more raw and less formulaic.  Maybe that's why it doesn't get old.  The first time I heard this album, I hated it.  I wanted more of what I had heard on Ten and this most definitely was not that.  After a few weeks of sitting on my shelf, I popped Vs. back in the tape player and realized just how great the album is.  I really don't care about Pearl Jam's politics, but they don't let their views interfere with the music.  At least not yet.  They do in later albums, though.  I'm not going to critique every song, but this is my go-to CD when I have to take a road trip.
0689859368|5.0|The Field Guide, in my mind, is superior in the realm of children's lit. Even in the present-day \\"Renaissance of Children's Literature\\" it is not often that one stumbles across a book with some many postive characteristics.<BR>For one, I do not understand the hullabaloo surrounding the similarity in packaging to the Lemony Snicket books. This book was not dark or full of satire like the Series of Unfortunate Events books. Truly, the packaging of these series is where the similarities begin and end.<BR>These series is probably more appropriate for a younger audience as well, except for one expletive (\\"crap\\") that adults may find objectionable.<BR>The family dynamics are believeable. The sibliings love each other and help each other out, but that doesn't stop rivalry or redicule.<BR>The story begins as the family moves into a new house, sans the father. After some exploring with the dumbwaiter, the children find mystifying secrets. The author's secrets are tough to figure out, but is good for mind-stretching purposes.<BR>I would especially recommend this book for children who may be too young for Harry Potter.

After reading the first story, I thought I could manage holding my laughs so I went out in public and start getting into it. Boy, I had to leave the cafe' soon cuz nobody in that place had any doubts that I am either lack some manners or crazy. The book is full of provoking jokes..But if you think of it, you just cant help but grining. From batteling with the letter \\"s\\" and all those trying hard to fix his flaws to putting up with his father saving up till starvation, Mr sedaris was helarious in dealing with every shot in his life...
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead are back at it again and from the first song on the album you know that they are back with guitars strapped on.  The album is definitely a blend of the different elements that made their past albums so incredible.  It does takes a few listens to really appreciate the album, but as you listen more of its moments standout and the better it gets.  Less earth shattering than their last two releases, but I don't think that detracts from its greatness.  If you haven't realized already Radiohead is the greatest band of this generation and they keep proving it over and over again.  Even without redefining themselves or rock music this time, they prove that they can just rock.  One of the few bands worth the hype.  Just brilliant.
B00000JMQE|5.0|This is one of the best fantasy films you've never seen.  It's truly a _fantasy_ not a cute musical that's more about Hollywood than the story.<br />&quot;Return to Oz&quot; sticks to Baum's original concept.  True fantasy is sometimes dark and speaks to our psyche, and Baum's original characters and setting is all here in this film which has more to say to us about honesty and compassion than a dozen of Disney's other &quot;sweetness and light&quot; films.

I love the song she sings in this movie.I also love the party scenes, the tiffany's scenes, and the last scene where she admits she is in love with her neighbor author Paul Varjak played by George Peppard.When I first saw this movie I did not know that her Asian neighbor was Mickey Rooney!They did a good make up job!I love this movie so I hope you will see it in the future.I hope this review helps!
0812550706|5.0|I relaly enjoyed reading this book. it was one of the few books that got me back into reading during the summer. although it did contain elements of science fiction, if you are not a sci fi buff you will love the story and plot and especially the protagonist Ender.
B000092ZYX|4.0|I'll admit, i'm one of those fans who repudiated Radiohead after hearing &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac.&quot; No matter how hard i tried, i just couldn't get into those albums. So i was hoping HTTT would be more accessable like their earlier albums. and it is. although this isn't a full throttle u-turn back to &quot;the bends&quot; it is considerably more rock and roll. &quot;2+2=5&quot; &quot;go to sleep&quot; and &quot;there there&quot; all  have salient amounts of electric guitar. the softer piano ballad &quot;sail to the moon&quot; is a beautiful song that has lyrics that suggest it was written about Yorke's son. and &quot;wolf at the door&quot;, my personal favorite from this album, reaches a point of surreal euphoria reminiscent of the beatles. excellent all around album.
0553573403|4.0|At first, this was certainly a highly enjoyable book to read. The first several hundred pages were amazing, and exactly what I'd expected and hoped for when I picked up this book.<br />From the beginning, one main thing caught my attention and held it fast: the finding of six direwolf pups, wolf-type animals which grow to be the size of a pony. As a lover of wolves, this immediately hooked me, as they are found in the first chapter. There were six direwolves, each of them given to the children of Lord Eddard stark of Winterfell. His bastard son Jon takes the white one which he finds away from the rest of the litter, which proves to help him quite well later on. The direwolves are constant throughout the book, as it is told through the view of many characters, including most of the children. Instead of chapter numbers, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" has the chapters labeled as the name of the main character it is following. With several main characters who are being followed, oftentimes it is quite easy to come to really love certain characters, and loath others so much that you just don't want them to exist anymore. From time to time, that could keep me from reading on, but once you really get into the book and the little plot of each character begins to really take shape, you find yourself looking forward to all chapters in the book. I still had my favourites-Jon Snow, Eddard Stark, his daughter Arya, and a dwarfed man called Tyrion Lannister-but I still found all of the chapters thoroughly enjoyable once the book truly got going.<br />\\"A Game of Thrones\\" is a very well-developed book. The characters are simply amazing, the histories of the differing houses and the land well planned and intricate, and the settings clear and well-defined. The characters often have certain traits associated to their particular house, such as the Lannister pride and the Stark honor. Seeing the story from all different views does little to change opinions of certain people, as their personalities do not change from seeing them through the eyes of different people. All of the houses and families of the book have deep histories to them, often explaining certain alliances seen as tension mounts in the political system of the Seven Kingdoms. The setting of the forests seen throughout the land, and the city of King's Landing are well set in the mind throughout the book. Slightly disappointingly, the cold of the north does not seem to be mentioned very much at all, making it seem almost as if snow is warm. Still, the idea and images are easy to remember and imagine.<br />There was a point in the book where I began change my high opinion of it, to some extent. There comes a point where everything seems to come crashing down around everyone, loved characters are stabbed in the back and chance moves completely the other way. Alliances are made and broken, men betrayed, and ambition rewarded as everyone plays their hand in the game of thrones. Too bad most of the losers seem to be some of the most loveable characters. When this begins, it doesn't end until the book ends. I couldn't put the book down, but still I was rarely happy about how things were going, and ofttimes I was very saddened about what happens to certain characters.<br />It left a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth, so in the end, I just couldn't quite say it's the best I've ever read, even though it was extremely close for several hundred pages. Nevertheless, this was a very good read, and I'd suggest this to just about anyone to read. Overall this was worth the time and money, and I look forward to the rest of the series.do not change from seeing them through the eyes of different people.

B00008J4P5|3.0|I went out to buy the new Radiohead disc and while I was there I picked up White Stripes to see what the fuss is about. I appreciate the band's raw, bare-bones style and punk attitude but it isn't exactly new. Several bands such as The Velvet Underground, The B52's, The Violent Fems, and even The Beatles have done this kind of thing before. As for recording an album with just two people and a basic recording machine, Todd Rundgren did a one man album 30 years ago, writing, producing and performing the entire thing by himself. And unfortunately for White Stripes, their songwriting doesn't come close to equaling any of the artists just mentioned. The major problem here is that there's a whole lotta cool, retro, minimalist style but not much content. And we all know what style over content equals, right? It means in a couple of years the teenage kids this music appeals to will mature into new tastes and White Stripes will be long forgotten. But as a cool little retro record to pass the summer with it's not bad.
B00005YUPO|4.0|As many others have said, this video isn't as great as the first one but it is still wonderful.  Unlike others, I have no problem seeing Julie Aigner-Clark's children.  My daughter particularly loves babies right now and will go to the TV to actually kiss the girls.  Tell me which parent(s), given the opportunity, wouldn't put their own child on screen for the whole world to see.
0812550706|5.0|I relaly enjoyed reading this book. it was one of the few books that got me back into reading during the summer. although it did contain elements of science fiction, if you are not a sci fi buff you will love the story and plot and especially the protagonist Ender.
0375823360|3.0|First off, I want to congratulate Philip Pullman on the <BR>scope and wonder he captures in this creative romp through<BR>many worlds. The story of Lyra and Will and their attempts<BR>to understand the universe and its nature is fun and gripping.<BR>Pullman's ability to evoke realistic worlds and images is <BR>amazing. His characters, on the whole, are interesting and <BR>compelling, and his creativity is second to none. The books<BR>attempt to deal with the great themes of philosophic and theological<br />thought: the nature of evil, the nature of redemption, the<BR>power of love, loyalty, the consequences of our actions and <BR>choices, etc. However, the overall message<BR>is fatally marred by what can only be described as the <BR>personal blind spot of the author himself.<br />In a piece of fiction that deals with multiple worlds and<BR>multiple species, one would expect there to be many, many<BR>ways of understanding the universe. And these would, presumably,<BR>hold similarities to each other in the way that the real world's <BR>great religions are similar. That is, one would expect divergence <BR>on rituals, mythologies, cosmological descriptions of origins, etc., <BR>but one would universally expect to see that the ends do not justify <BR>the means, that love, humility, charity, concern for others, etc. are extolled<BR>and taught as the greatest truths and virtues, that striving toward wisdom and<BR>communion with the sacred is a task we all share. And Pullman's trilogy <BR>_does_, to a certain extent, respect these great truths...with<BR>one incredible exception. <br />It becomes clear in The Golden Compass that Pullman equates <BR>the Catholic Church, and Christianity in general, with the <BR>very _essence_ of evil and power-grubbing authoritarianism. And near<BR>the end of the Amber Spyglass he has declared, unambiguously,<BR>that there is no God and that Christianity is a compelling but<BR>erroneous belief. He describes<BR>an institutional Church that, apparently, preaches hatred, intolerance,<BR>torture, and fananticism...really the worst caricature of the worst <BR>abuses of the Catholic church over the last two millenia. Interestingly <BR>enough, however, every _other_ religious worldview presented (secular <BR>humanism, Deism,<BR>Scientism, Shamanism, skepticism, Paganism, pragmatism, <BR>and a watered-down form of Buddhism) <BR>is seen as worthy. All beliefs about the world are shown to be valid and <BR>honorable..._except_ Christianity (and Catholicism in particular).<br />The incredible narrowness of the author's expressed <BR>hatred of Christianity may well be, as some reviewers have suggested, a personal<BR>thing. And I have no doubt that Mr. Pullman is entitled to his<BR>beliefs. But the very zealotry that he seems to display in his hatred<BR>of Christianity is the very _essence_ of what his protagonists profess to <BR>hate about the Catholic church...their intolerance, their inability<BR>to see beyond their own closely-held worldview, the \\"rightness\\" of<BR>their point of view versus everyone else's.<br />I don't believe this book tries to \\"take down\\" Christianity per se, <BR>although one could argue that Pullman tries to do just that. But <BR>I believe because of Mr. Pullman's own confused moral sense and <BR>bigotry, the books seem to show an incredibly lopsided view of what the universe<BR>looks like. Lying, cheating, killing are all fine and have no long-term<BR>consequences, according to Pullman, if the ends are worthy enough; you don't<BR>even have to regret the wrongs you to do others along the way (witness<BR>the ironically Christian-like redemption of Lyra's parents at the end of the <BR>trilogy, despite their collective torture and killing of innocents). <BR>Morals are all relative, and all philosophies of the nature of life are <BR>fine, just as long as they aren't Catholic. <br />Deep truths abound in these books, but they always seem just out of reach <BR>of its author, and thus, out of reachof the reader. We never seem to know <BR>what the point of the journey was, unless it was just the fun of the ride. <BR>But this moral confusion and undisguised bias against all things Christian <BR>takes what _could_ have been a great trilogy...even a saga of the magnitude <BR>and scope of Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\", and reduces it to a moral muddle. <br />What a shame.
0385335482|4.0|This is an awesome summer/anytime read.  The book def. flows quickly and there is no shortage of laughs.  Once you read the first you will be hooked and have to buy 2 and 3 which are equally hilarious.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Finally the \\"real\\" Radiohead is back. Sorry to say this, and I am a huge Coldplay fan, but they are so watered down and bland compared to the complexity and depths that this band take their music to. It is truly incredible. Radiohead joins the ranks of bands like Pink Floyd in which you MUST listen to their albums more than once to completely take in the sounds and lyrics they are exploring. I sandwhich this album between The Bends & OK Computer on my list as fav Radiohead albums. After all this crap that's on the Billboard charts (rap, country, boy-band pop) real music is finally coming back. Thank you Radiohead for showing them how it's done!
B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie is so wonderful!!! I know I have rated this movie like 100 times but oh well! Its an all around great movie! When I saw it for the third time when it was over my freinds & I started to sing All That Jazz in front of everyone! I love everything about this movie! The songs are wonderful! The cast is wonderful! Catherine Zeta Jones & Queen Latifah really shine in this movie! The scenes with those two together have to be some of the best in the move! I thought Moulin Rouge was ok but Im sorry after seeing Chicago you realize Moulin Rouge stinks! <BR>Renee Zellweger totally deserved the OsCaR! Im sorry but Nicole Kidman was not that good in The Hours. This movie is a cLaSsIc & it will be remembered for a VeRy long time!
B00008G9JO|2.0|Hmm....Well, I don't know. I'm inclined to consider Weathercock, for example, a song about...a weathercock. Okay, like the songs having to do with animals, this song having to do with an inanimate non-animal also anthopomophises, but that's pretty much it for imagination. (&quot;Rasping&quot; aside, the singing here and elsewhere strikes me as rather inanimate itself.) Speaking of Weathercock, its refrain is home to one of those &quot;rare melodic bits&quot; (or however it was put) we occasionally find on this album. Its verse basically drones in turn on one of three pitches, with pentatonic embellishment and only vestigial harmonic accompaniment. The &quot;rare melodic bit&quot; I'm thinking of is a pentatonic neume above a supertonic triad preceded by the (major) tonic triad on &quot;Sing to us softly; hum evening's song&quot;. For better or worse, you've heard something very like this many times before. Conversely, the bit that makes me cringe (especially the second time when &quot;Tell us how the blacksmith...&quot; becomes &quot;Point the way to...&quot;) comes directly after: a lowered leading-tone major triad preceded by the dominant triad, which seems to ME (not necessarily to you) jarring, crude, and unrelated to what came directly before.<br />Let's also mention briefly some things this album does RIGHT. 1) David Palmer is writing for actual strings again. (The electronic imitations on Songs From The Wood were rather annoying.) 2) Ian Anderson IS in good voice on the lyrical section of Heavy Horses (the song)--if not elsewhere. 3) John Evan's piano accompaniment here is especially appealing.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|fiona is one of the few artists that can write AND sing.  she's a pure talent who you can tell puts her all into her work.  truely thoughtful and thought-provoking.  <br />i loved her debut album, and i'm in love with her sophomore album.  whenever she releases her third album, i'll preorder it.  there's no need to wait for the first single so see if i like it, because i'm sure i'll absolutely LOVE it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|...that hasn't already been said?<br />there is no other band in the world that makes music this epic, this despondent, this erudite, this raging, this nervous, this eerie, this fully realized, this eminently satisfying--and HTTT is a stunning, draining listen from start to finish.<br />for evidence, try the shuffling, sinuous groove of \\"a punchup at a wedding,\\" the breathless, dense-with-threat \\"a wolf at the door,\\" the lurching, ominous \\"myxomatosis,\\" the howling denouement to \\"there there,\\" the mournful resignation of \\"i will\\" or the skittering, hypnotic outro to \\"sit down. stand up.\\" <br />it's high time the radiohead obsession began anew. HTTT, like its four predecessors, is one for the ages. cheers.
B000006045|5.0|Of all the Massive Attack albums, this one is the best.  Dark and eerie, strange and wonderful.  If you're looking for a place to start with this band, this is it.  If you've heard 'Blue Lines' or 'Protection' and you liked them, I guarantee this one will blow you away.  Massive Attack is one of the best things happening today.
B000089RVX|1.0|When I heard &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; on the radio, I was thrilled. I thought a new band had broken through with a fresh sound. I bought the CD and I was totally disappointed. Yes, the single is an awesome song, but the rest of the CD is lacking. Every song sounds exactly the same and the only variation is the tempo. Amy Lee has an amazing voice but she needs better songs to sing. A lot of this material sounds recycled from the early 90's. The urgency and the rawness of &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; is void on every other song. This band seems doomed for a permanent place in the Kingdom of One Hit Wonders.
B000092ZYX|4.0|They've done it again.  Radiohead presents the world with another beautiful album.  While still using alot of the more \\"out-there\\" sounds of Kid A and Amnesiac, they have blended that sound with beautiful melodies and taken out some of the eletronic noises thats characterised their last two albums which makes Hail to the Thief very reminiscent of The Bends and OK Computer. Songs like \\"Sail to the Moon\\" keep the spacey feel of Kid A, but are more stripped down using only piano or guitar. Not to say that this album is just the same old stuff though.  It presents alot of new sound, especially on tracks like \\"Backdrifts.\\"  All in all, its a great album that is still very much the old Radiohead sound, but also is fresh enough to keep it interesting.  Nice work gentlemen!
B00008OWZC|5.0|this album offers the best sound quality of a 70's live album. Using that benefit with led zeppelin =  one great album.  I just started listening to led about a year ago and it has been good. I had to let the music wear on me first because of the high pitch of robert and the loads of guitar from jimmy.  I am a drummer so i think john bonham is great and on this cd, he is really in the spotlight performing some great fill-ins.  The price may be a bit much for a 3 disc-not-so-many-songs-cd but it is worth it if you wanna here a big bang.  enjoy the album
B00007E8V4|1.0|dreadful, i cant believe i even listened to it, they scream, thats about it, yes the musicians are talented, and yes technically the singer is good, but all he does is scream!!!!! except for a few trimes, they also make the worst looks ever, they r all wierd looking, i cringe every time i hear it, i just hate it, im thought there could be one good song, instead of getting this get the new audioslave or Madonna, much better than this [stuff]
B00000K0DV|2.0|And badly dubbed.  This was my first Fulci movie, and I know they're SUPPOSED to be badly dubbed, but I found I couldn't even enjoy this one according to the 'so bad it's good' idea.  I became concious as I watched that I was wasting precious minutes of my life, and began reaching for the fast forward button.  <br />The level of the film is pitched so low that it's really not worth bothering about arguments of depravity of misogyny - I just simply could never take it that seriously.   Maybe it's an acquired taste - but in order to acquire it I would have to spend even more time watching this stuff, and life's just too short.<br />For real film about the gutters of New York, with luscious cinamatography, I'd still rather watch Taxi Driver.

B00008LDPU|4.0|A lot of other reviewers have already commented on how the Wachowski Brothers borrow heavily from anime and manga to create The Matrix. They now complete the circle with The Animatrix.<br />THE ANIMATRIX is a series of short animated films from several Japanese anime directors (and a couple of American ones as well). I call attention to the now 15+ year old ROBOT CARNIVAL, which is a Japanese movie composed of a series of animated short pieces strung together by the narrative hook of robots. Perhaps not surprisingly, there is an overlap as Kouji Morimoto directed bits for both films (\\"Franken's Gear\\" in Robot Carnival and \\"Beyond\\" in The Animatrix).<br />The Animatrix does succeed in extending Matrix universe by allowing other creative minds to play with the setting. \\"Final Flight of the Orsiris\\", essentially a prologue to Matrix Reloaded, is from the creators of the beautifully rendered but soul-less Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. As the closest thing to \\"film\\" in The Animatrix, it makes for a nice bridge between this animated and the theatrical release. (Okay, I admit I wasn't sure if they were CG-characters or rotoscoped at first.) As animation, it is nothing new or special.<br />My favorites of the short films are \\"The Second Renaissance\\", Parts I and II. There is some filling of the backstory on the history of Men and Machines. It also makes the best use of anime as a mirror for reality. Another piece I really liked was \\"Matriculated\\" from Aeon Flux creator Peter Chung. The idea of humans kidnapping and reprogramming machines by seducing them with fleshy pleasures is the closest The Animatrix come to extending (and inverting) the metaphor of the Matrix.<br />The other story which is most scifi is \\"Beyond\\". Here, in a glitch in the Matrix creates a \\"haunted house\\" in the midst of a Tokyo (?) burb. It is also the most fantastical story with a classic (cliche?) twist ending. For me, \\"Beyond\\" is childlike and plain delightful.<br />\\"Kid's Story\\" and \\"World Record\\" are cool enough vignettes of other humans in the Matrix. Stylistically, they very much echo anime conventions. They don't add new understanding to the Matrix, however. <br />The one piece that could have and should have dealt with the whole \\"blue pill/red pill\\" dichotomy is \\"Program\\". Here, a recruit is tempted by her trainer/handler to return to the Matrix. It could have been an interesting extension of humans choosing between the discomfort of reality vs the faux-paradise of the Matrix. Instead, \\"Program\\" is merely a battle between two humans. Thus \\"Program\\" is merely an animated rendering of a film apeing anime conventions. (Echoes of Scary Movie/Scream/teen slasher movies, anyone?)
B00000IMTF|5.0|Can someone tell me why Rainbow isn't as well known or respected as Zeppelin? Or Sabbath for that matter?  Zeppelin kinda hogged all the spotlight for 70s hard rock and left some other great groups without their due credit.  Uriah Heep, Blue Oyster Cult and Thin Lizzy to name a few.  Sure, Ritchie Blackmore and Rainbow are considered to be be classics in the critics' eyes, but who of the younger generation has even heard of Rainbow?  There are some, but not many.  The only people I run into who know about them are folks my parents' age who were youngsters during Rainbow's prime.  Well folks, instead of adding Houses Of The Holy to your collection, why don't you pick up Rising instead.  You won't regret it, coz this is a killer album.  Not a wasted second.  Ritchie Blackmore really got the green weenie, he should be higher up on the guitar players list than he is.  Go ahead and crucify me, but the man's a better player than Jimmy Page.  Don't take my word for it, listen to the album coz the guitar playing speaks for itself.  So, if you have any love for 70s hard rock, you'd &quot;better lay your money dooooown.&quot; and get Rising.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park is by far the greatest band in the universe because they rock... rock hard... yeah.  they are sooo goood and this album is just proof of their invincible greatness.  yes, invincible greatness.  they can't be stopped. holla.
B00007EBAG|5.0|Don't let the first few seconds of O Divina fool you this is not a slow laid back album. WILDCAD! is a great album full of dance beats and great vocals. This is best shown on Designated Fool. Even though TTD has changed his name to Sananda Maitreya it is good to know the music has not changed. TTD has made a positive statement with this album, enjoy.
B00005NB0H|5.0|I don't find it necessary to write a long review of this album. When it first came out on vinyl, it contained only 6 tracks ! However, the ENERGY and FERROCITY contained in these tracks caused me to dub it \\"The Greatest Live Rock Album ever made ! The 1995 expanded release took it a step further by adding another 8 tracks bringing it to 14 tracks ! Better Still ! Now with the Deluxe Edition incorporating \\"Tommy\\", we finally have the complete Leeds show ! It was worth the wait ! My advise to you.....DON'T WAIT....BUY IT NOW !!
B00004RF8J|5.0|This movie's great! I'm doing my drama exam this week at school and we are doing a scene from The Little Shop of Horrors. I'm in a group of girls (i'm a girl as well) but most of them are very stubborn and won't play the male part. So i said i'd do it coz i love anything to do with drama. I got to play Orin, the sadistic dentist and i really enjoyed it playing that part. Itz fun playing evil characters and i'm glad my friends didn't want to do it. Even though he's a baddie, he really makes me laugh, especially in that song, Dentist (as well as the scene with Bill Murray). I find it weird that i liked that song coz i despise going 2 the dentist. I haven't seen the whole movie but from what i've seen, it's brill! It's about this nerdy but sweet florist called Seymour (ahhh) who fancies his co-worker Audrey (a girl with a strange but sweet wispy voice) who's dating that crazy dentist who is abusive towards her and treats her badly. Seymour reckons that the only way to make her fall in love with him is because of this amazing plant he gets (who he calls Audrey Two). BUT this plant doesn't feed on water, it feeds on human blood. Audrey Two begins growing, talking and begs for more than just Seymour cutting himself. He bumps off Orin (yeah that was my scene, i had to act completely insane) and his boss. It's a brilliant movie and i'm getting the DVD of it this summer, i can't wait! The acting in it is great (round of applause for Steve Martin especially) and I hope a lot of people will like it, watch it, you won't regret it!<BR>(Personally, i don't mind that the original ending didn't go very well at the start coz i think it would be sad to see such a happy movie go so wrong at the end. I'd like to have seen it though). <BR> My favourite songs from the movie are Downtown, Dentist and Suddenly Seymour.<BR> Oh please hope i do well in my exam!<br />Later: I'm just editing my review, I got my DVD in July. It was brilliant. Little Shop of Horrors is my favourite film of all time, I love it! The special features were great (shame they took away original ending, I heard they might be putting it back, in colour!), the outtakes were hysterically funny and Behind the Scenes was great (although I would have like to have seen Steve Martin interviewed). My drama exam was fine! My teacher thought it was very funny. I was hoping we'd do it for our school play, but we're not :( I would audition for Orin Scrivello D.D.S definitely even though i'm a girl, I can do the voice! But readers, you have to buy this film coz even though I only found about it back in May when my teacher chose it for our topic, itz the best I've ever seen! Go ahead! Buy it and you will never ever regret it!<BR> You know something, I was at the dentist the other day getting a 'long slow root canal' done! Honestly, ow itz so painful! Thank God my dentist was normal!
B000092ZYX|5.0|If you have been worried about 'Hail To The Thief' living up to the impossibly high standards that only Radiohead can achieve, I'm here to let you know your worries are unfounded. Many complain that Radiohead are oft judged based on the merits/sounds of their previous works, and personally I don't appreciate the rampant \\"'The Bends'/'OK Computer'\\" comparisons made so often when a new album of theirs comes out. Honestly, however, Radiohead are a band which in their own overt way are so far removed from other musicians (although there ARE links if you look hard enough, like Autchere, Aphex Twin, Miles Davis, Smiths, Pixies, REM, etc.) that they become a specific type of beast, one which can only be put into perspective with their own works ('Pablo Honey', their first effort, notwithstanding). And yes, their new record shares much with the groundbreaking albums which preceded it, 'Kid A' and to a lesser extent 'Amnesiac' with its affinity for computer-generated soundscapes and intricate, methodic pacing.<BR>But it, like Radiohead itself, emerges after several listens to be a beast of its own.<br />In its musical impact, lyrical sentiments and overall relevance HTTT emerges as being their most direct and technically \\"pop\\" record ever, even more so than Pablo Honey. Thom Yorke has always claimed this would be a much more accessible record, and it shows from the first moments in \\"2+2=5.\\" The song is by no means mainstream, lowbrow, or simplistic, yet it resonates with an impact that Radiohead's music (at least recently) hasn't shown. The drum machine at the beginning comes off as nervous, organic, real, rather than cold and frosty as it usually comes across with their music. Yorke's plaintive cries, Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien's guitars, and Colin Greenwood's bass undertones are crisp, dry, immediate. Phil Selway's drums pummel with force. Even though this song has all the intricacy of Kid A and Amnesiac, it carries little of the subtlety. To wit, it hits you like a brick.<br />Rather than giving the record some time to age and unfold itself, HTTT tries to capture a more live, energetic performance of Radiohead's. It resembles the overlooked road album New Adventures in Hi-Fi by REM in that it tries to capture the intensity of the moment. Instrumentation flows naturally into electronic soundscapes. The skitter of electronic pulses on \\"Sit Down Stand Up\\" break perfectly into pounding drums, Yorke's mantra of \\"The Raindrops,\\" and driving, forceful bass. \\"Myxomatosis\\" later on buzzes with all the warmth of a saw, it's towering synth line knocking you hard into your seat, like the relentlessness of the media it chronicles. Yorke has maintained themes of looming darkness, hopelessness, control, fear for our future, and on here they ram them home with the force of importance. While Kid A and Amnesiac were more obscure treatisies on the state of our world and all the paranoia, madness, loss and hope it implies, Hail to the Thief is a (slightly) more focused statement. What they say here, they mean passionately, and they don't want to waste time. This is war, on Radiohead's terms. Pop music forms are a means to the end.<br />This record also takes a direction that other Radiohead records haven't, and gives it further identity: warmth. Camp and even almost sensual mood pieces abound, such as \\"Go to Sleep,\\" \\"We Suck Young Blood,\\" and \\"A Punch-Up at a Wedding,\\" which manages to lay a thick piano and bass guitar groove over vaguely political lyrics. The voice of Yorke is clear, impassioned, and equal parts hissing and soothing. The more wholly electronic experiments, \\"Backdrifts\\" (the best song on here) and \\"The Gloaming\\" benefit from the tones of his voice, the earlier a plea to succeed even as one knows one is doomed to failure, the later an almost Grimm fairy tale style musing on approaching darkness, sung almost mantra-like. People complained about the inclusion of electronic textures before. They will find here how wrong they are: Radiohead have mastered the genre and techniques and prove they can manufacture fantastic compositions no matter what the medium.<br />Overflowing in warmth, purpose, and importance, already it can be seen that this has a strong chance at becoming Album of the Year. With most of Radiohead's records my proper reccomendation if you're wary would be to \\"spend time with it, let it try to grow on you.\\" I have a feeling, though, that if this one doesn't bowl you over on first listen, you probably don't deserve the pleasure of appreciating good music. There's too much here to be stuck nay-saying. Either hop on board or get out of the way.
B0000542D2|2.0|I like the Beatles, I like British humor (big fan of Python), and I like movies about music.  But this movie is so slow and boring, I don't know what the big deal is?  Sure, it's great watching the Beatles run around, and you get a sense of their chemistry.  And of course, the music is fantastic.  But the directing is sloppy, the jokes unfunny, and the invisible storyline painfully tedious.  More of a curiosity picture than a movie.  For die-hard Beatles fans only.  Even the Monkees were better at this sort of thing...
B00005JM1F|1.0|How dare some people compare this yawn to a classic like Animal House. This movie was terrible. I love a comedy as much as the next guy but come on, give me a break. This was a bad story (been done to many times before) bad acting, bad jokes, bad everything. For you people who compare this to Animal House you need a class on classic comedies. Go rent Airplane, Animal House, even Hot Shots but dont waste your time with this tragedy.
B00008PX8P|5.0|It's a TEN starts double DVD! Five stars to each disc! Jimmy Page has proved that he's still a genius! What more can I say?
B00008JLKL|4.0|I fell in love with Era after hearing a just a few little pieces off their second album, Era 2.  That album is pure joy, and besides listening to it a lot myself, I've also given it as a gift.  <br />Therefore, after such a long time, I was thrilled that Era just came out with another album.  It wasn't a question of if I was going to buy it, but rather when.  <br />This album is good, but it seems to lack the magic of their previous albums (especially their second).  Some of the music seems almost recycled, and, in contrast to Era 2, there is a lot more solo singing in English.  This in itself isn't bad, but it seems to draw the focus away from the chants and lush orchestrations.  On listening to this album a couple times now, I almost get the feeling that a lot of the orchestral pieces on this album could be movie background music, which isn't bad, but I did expect something more inspiring and alive from Era.
0790733226|1.0|This movie symbolizes everything that's bad about pop sci-fi.  A deep, meaningful movie that made no real sense, had a plot that DRAGGED, and was filled with countless scientific blunders, unfounded assumptions (evidently you have to be an atheist to be a scientist), and ultimately left the viewer asking the inevitable question &quot;What the hell was that all about?&quot;.  If you truly like science fiction avoid this movie at all costs.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Superman the Movie is by far the best comic book movie ever made. The acting is top notch led by Christopher Reeve, Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman doing a legendary portrayal of Lex Luthor. This movie is great for kids and grandparents alike. There is quite a bit of action, but not gratuitous violence so everybody can watch. This movie is a classic right up there with some of the best fantasy movies of all time, including &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. A perfect 10/10.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I really didn't think after hearing how good hybrid theory was that it was possible to have such a good original sophmore follow-up for a band that plays music like Linkin Park.  I thought this album was going to be seriously lacking something.  But Linkin Park proved me wrong.<BR>    Plenty of good tracks on this record, &quot;Numb&quot; and &quot;Don't Stay&quot; were my personal favorites.  Im more of a emo-core fan than anything else, so honestly I dont listen to a lot of music that could be considered in the same genre with Linkin Park.  But if youare looking for an album to just rock out with on your stereo either in your car or home, then look no further, because this album is by far one of the best of its kind to come out this year.
0385504209|1.0|I began this novel knowing only a small bit about the contents, not having visited here prior to purchase.  If you are a Christian, Catholic or Protestant either one, this is not the book for you.  Blasphemy disguised as intellectualism.  What's so sad about it is that people who haven't studied the Bible and its history will believe the fables therein.  My main question after reading the novel is, if Christ was merely a normal man, not divine, not God's Son, then why would his bloodline be of Royal Lineage?  Makes no sense whatsoever.  His bloodline only matters if He is God's own Son, as He claimed.
B000092ZYX|5.0|.. A few weeks back, when \\"Hail to the Thief\\" was first announced, I thought to myself, \\"If it is in fact a good album, Radiohead will have created something of rather singular achievement: the worst title for a significant work of art in the history of the Western tradition.\\" For better or worse, Radiohead have failed to rise to that challenge. \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is not a bad set of songs (I'd certainly rather listen to it than to the majority of new releases), but it lacks magic in the same sense that the title \\"Hail to the Thief\\" lacks magic compared to the humor and literacy of \\"OK Computer\\". Like its title, Thief accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do, creating musically sophisticated songs of vague social topicality, but it fails to go beyond that point. Though title and songs \\"fit\\" in an external sense (that is, they sound like what smart, hip culture is supposed to sound like), they lack an internal depth that is the heart of art.<br />The first track, 2+2=5, demonstrates the aesthetic shallowness of the album quite clearly. A dynamic tour de force with the central line of \\"YOU HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION\\", it has all the surface elements of a great rock song and yet none of the feeling of great music. On a technical level, its transition from the opening melody of \\"two and two always make a five\\" to the heterogeneous punk wailing of \\"hail to the thief, oh, hail to the thief- but I'm not!\\" is quite impressive. On the latter bit, listeners are also treated to a few gorgeous, classic Radiohead synth effects. Furthermore, the theme is clear and relevant: politicians have lulled the public into accepting the fallacious and fascistic logic behind their \\"crusade for freedom\\" for too long. So what's the problem? There is, in fact, a big problem: 2+2=5 has no soul, no internal logic. The political sentiments are true, but bland, the sort that are easy to agree with (or disagree, for that matter) because they proclaim party allegiance rather than present a personal view. And, though the three melodies are novel and expertly blended, they also have nothing to do with each other. There's no particular musical connection between the beginning and the end of the song, only an incidental one. Reflecting on where it ends reveals nothing about where it begins, and vice versa. 2+2=5 is still certainly a solid rock song, and should still send music geeks to their keyboards. Listeners yearning for the sublimely orchestrated soundscapes of OK Computer and Kid A (or Quadrophenia, or Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, or Tristan und Isolde, or Verdi's Requiem, etc...), however, should search elsewhere.<br />Not that there aren't a few memorable tunes. Where I End and You Begin has a nice sense of dynamics and background synthesizer interplay, resulting in song that feels very complete from beginning to end. Scatterbrain is a sweet, simply structured melody performed with just enough gusto to make it the next single. As befits a maturing band, the softer songs are also getting mighty pretty: Sail to the Moon, We suck Young Blood, I Will; these have the gentle touch of true feeling. The latter especially is an example of true, classical song-craft. With three voices soaring around a single, subdued guitar, it reminded me more of Schubertian lieder than anything one could hear on the radio. The song is preceded by the fantastic single, There There, which sees the band engaging a fairly standard rock structure with perhaps the best developed melody on the album. With something like a chorus, a triple-guitar/triple-drum orchestration that actually expands the logic of the melodic progression, and what is almost a guitar solo by Johnny near the end, There There manages to be both the most superficially conservative and the most fundamentally creative track on the album. On the seven-odd minutes in which I Will follows There There, \\"Hail to the Thief\\" briefly becomes the great rock album that it promised to be. As it actually is, however, the whole is a thoroughly professional, engagingly musical, and socially aware piece of popular entertainment. And nothing more.

B00008NRI9|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I'm a Bullock fan and (sort-of) a Grant fan, the combination was wonderful! Bullock plays a lawyer who works for legal aid doing \\"good\\" by protesting the destruction of anything with any sort of importance to someone.  Grant plays the playboy in charge of a company who plans to knock down most of the things that Bullock is trying to save.  By a twist of fate, she ends up his lawyer.  This way she can be sure he uses his millions to do good.<br />The chemistry plays out brilliantly - and naturally.  When Bullock decides she cannot bear to work for him any longer and gives her 2 week (more like 2 month) notice, he informs every potential employer that he can't do with out her.  She agrees to find her replacement for him- who ends up being a pretty, sexy red head looking to bed the boss!  This finally makes Grant & Bullock realize they have feelings for each other.<br />Grant's witt and humor are all over this movie and combining him with Bullock's charm makes this a winner!  The traffic jam scene will crack up any audience!  Grab some popcorn and enjoy!<br /><br />This one is worth buying to keep for future viewing!<br /><br />1smileycat :-)

B00003CXXI|5.0|This is one movie that never makes it to the bottom of our pile of movies! I have young children and they almost have the movie memorized! (as do I!!)<br />Shrek is about an Ogre and a talking Donkey on a journey to rescue a Princess from a fire-breathing dragon so that Shrek can get his swamp back from all of the Fairy Tale creatures that have been evicted by Lord Farquaad in an attempt to make himself more popular.<br />There is so much adult humor in this movie!!  In all the times I've seen the movie - I still catch something new I missed the first 25 times around!! The animation is awesome! There's even a song at the end with all of the fairy tale creatures involved - be sure not to stop & rewind too early!!<br />This movie will keep you watching and laughing the whole way thru! Worth buying! Gather friends and watch as a group- the laughs will be even bigger!!<br />**a word of caution to parents, there is one (and only 1 time, I think) naughty word in here...what's another name for a donkey?

B000002H33|5.0|whenever i tell my friends that i like metallica, they think i'm crazy.  they are living in a time where metallica has completely gone away from their roots.  the lyrics mean nothing now.  james sounds like ....  kirk doesnt even have guitar solos in st. anger!  WHAT A BUNCH OF SELLOUTS! if only i can get my friends to listen to master of puppets, or any of their first 4 albums (black album is pretty good too, a little too mainstream)...<br />Battery - similar to the opening songs in ride the lightning and ...and justice for all.  it starts slow, then kicks your ... 9/10<BR>Master of Puppets - don't get me wrong, i love this song, but it's a little overrated, it can get a little repetitive after a while, still good though 8/10<BR>The Thing that Should Not Be - good song.  i don't really know what else to say 8/10<BR>Welcome Home (Sanitarium) - great song, starts slow with a real good guitar part, then a few minutes into the song it gets nice and heavy. 9/10<BR>Disposable Heroes - best song on the cd.  played at a lightning fast speed, very good lyrics about the hardships of war and how it can really change a person.  BACK TO THE FRONT! 10/10<BR>Leper Messiah - good song, a little slower than some of the others, good lyrics again:  talks about religious people who sell god to make money 8/10<BR>Orion - easily metallica's best instrumental, cliff is great in this song 9/10<BR>Damage Inc. - starts off slow, but turns into one of the best thrash metal songs i have ever heard 9/10<br />this cd is definitely worth your money, especially for those who have only heard metallica stuff from the post ..And Justice For All era
0783225857|5.0|We watched this DVD once again, but on a note of sadness.<br />We mourn Gregory Peck's passing, June 12, 2003.<br />Look no further than this film for the full measure of his talent, and a good glimpse at the kind of man he was in real life. It is fitting that he lived just long enough to know of the honor bestowed on his character Atticus Finch, named Greatest Hero in film by the American Film Institute .  While mortal in life, he is immortal in film. So long, Greg!<br />This DVD treats this classic film very well indeed, though some will always want for more extra features.  The picture is beautiful, the sound is good, the \\"making-of\\" retrospective is wonderful -- a must for your film library!  I'm not sure why they put colorized stills on the DVD box cover; it is a black and white film, but please don't let that stop you!<br />I have always thought this film deserved a better place on AFI's list of top films than #34, such as the top 10. It is as fine a two-hour distillation of Harper Lee's great American novel as you could ever ask for -- a beautiful, elegant film that exactly captures the spirit and essence of time and place and character. Fabulous direction, photography, editing, writing, acting, and music come together seamlessly in a perfect, tight fabric. It is an astounding achievement in screenplay based on such a novel.  Of course the novel is far better, more complete, but it is a great film on its own merits.<br />Harper Lee shows us the beauty and contradictions and ugliness in Southern culture as no one has before or since. She shows us her disappointment in and revulsion of aspects of her white Southern heritage, while at the same time showing us her great pride in a culture that is so rich and so beautiful when it throws off the ugly cloak of hatred and discrimination (take note, all ye \\"proud\\" wavers of the Confederate battle flag). Human arrogance and selfishness have wrought such evils, in this case from slavery to civil war to the desire for vengeance and scapegoats, often (and still) in the name of God. Let us learn from our history, improve ourselves, and sin no more.<br />Buy this film, watch this film, love this film.  Be Atticus Finch!or vengeance and scapegoats, often (and still) in the name of God. Let us learn from our history, improve ourselves, and sin no more. <br />Buy this film, watch this film, love this film.  Be Atticus Finch!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Except for a few songs, the music to Hail to the Thief has largely a surreal, and eerie feel almost mirroring the twilight mood our nation is facing under the Bush administration. <BR>There's no need for angry lyrics and catchy drumbeats to sway the masses enlightening and reminding them of 9/11, the Enron scandals, the Iraq war, the tax cuts for the wealthy, the right wing anti american administration, or the &quot;party like its ronald reagan 1984 all over again&quot; 'tude---the calm and serene lyrics, and flow of the music is all one needs to understand we are all powerless (but not voiceless) in this apolitical environment.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Hail to Thief is an awesome album. All the songs are a beautiful mix of guitar and electronic beats and noises.  Think &quot;Kid A&quot; meets &quot;The Bends&quot;.   Don't expect every song sounding like their single 'there there' though.  Most of the songs on Hail to the Thief are still pretty electronic.  And just like most of their albums it takes a couple listens through to fully appreaciate it. Its not breakthrough, but its still damn good.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Thom Yorke has described Hail to the Thief as &quot;OK Computer 2&quot;, and in many ways it does give a tip of the hat to their 1997 masterpiece.  But back then, when the Oxford quintet was searching for new ways to express themselves both musically and lyrically, they were travelling new ground on an uncharted course.  Three albums and six years later, Thom and company have become mega-stars and inspired a host of followers and imitators, and their impact has been so great on the musical landscape that they seem sometimes to be competing against their previous efforts. It ain't easy, after all, to continue being cutting edge and inventive.<BR>&quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; continues Radiohead's exploration of the isolation, disillusionment and compartmentalization of modern society, with stories of helplessness in the face of repression, loneliness and yearnings in the face of overwhelming odds, be they personal, political or ethical.<BR>The album opens with &quot;2+2=5&quot;, in which the boys demonstrate that they can still strap on their guitars and rock, and &quot;There There&quot;  is a radio-friendly slice of pulsating drums and urgent riffing.  &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot; is perhaps their most beautiful ballad in years, with lovely piano accompaniment.  &quot;Backdrifts&quot; and &quot;Where I End and You Begin&quot; are haunting, melodic pieces that express Radiohead's ability to fully orchestrate a song without the bombast and overly-produced excess to which most bands may have fallen prey.<BR>&quot;A Punchup at a Wedding&quot; gives us a beautiful little piano dittie puncuated by a scathing diatribe against a boorish fool, and &quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot; ends the record on a dark, disturbing note.<BR>Fans of modern electronica may find &quot;The Gloaming&quot;, &quot;Myxomatosis&quot;  and other bits on Hail to be a tad wanting when compared to true masters of the genre, but they do entertain nonetheless.<BR>Taken as a whole, &quot;Hail...&quot; is anaccomplished work by a band that's at a crossroads; They've mastered their craft, yet they continue to search for new means by which to express themselves.  &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; will probably not garner the band many new fans, as it's neither as lush, rich and rewarding as OK Computer, nor as challenging and aloof as Kid A, but this album should still give their fans a satisfying record that takes many a listening to fully appreciate the intricacies and nuances of a highly accomplished artistic talent.  If it is, as it sounds, a bit of a step back from &quot;Amnesiac&quot; and &quot;Kid A&quot; toward the more comfortable &quot;OK Computer&quot;, it begs the question, &quot;What's Next?&quot;
B00007BK2N|4.0|Im definiatly not the most qualified person to write this review partially because I am of a much later generation than this music. I know nothing about the band joy division. And I still beleive that they are not punk. Sounded like new wave to me in the movie. Anyways, the movie itself was filmed in such a way it appeared to be a documentary not an acted film to me. Tony Wilsons dialogue was very interesting and thought provoking. It was also interesting to watch these people go through their lives. I would have to watch this movie atleast one more time to totally grasp all the thematical elements, but it is definiatly a suggested movie if you are bored of the &quot;popular&quot; movies of today.
0393057658|5.0|This book will really appeal to hardcore baseball fans who've embraced the conclusions of Bill James and his proteges.  Lewis has a very readable style, and he doesn't shy away from some of the more complicated aspects of baseball analysis.  He includes a nice history of cutting edge thinking on the subject of baseball analysis that reveals that Bill James wasn't (and isn't) the only voice crying out in the desert.  Also, there are anecdotes involving contemporary players and coaches that demonstrate the gulf between how players and analysts view the game.  As you may have heard, Billy Beane doesn't come off in the most flattering light, but it's a credit to Beane that he didn't seek to edit unfavorable content as well as to Lewis for keeping this content in the book.  It's a fast read and interesting to boot.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I hadnt listened to this album in years until today, and Im totally blown away all over again by its timelessness. I remember when it was first released- I was an 11 year old girl.. my mother bought it and we played it constantly...little did I know then, that it would be this album that would cement my lifelong obsession with music...I would read the lyrics, and sing the songs even though I hadnt a clue what half the lyrics meant.. I'd dance to Sir Duke, even though I didnt even know who Duke Ellington and Satchimo were back then...Id groove to ORDINARY PAIN.. even though it was years before I knew the word massochistic..I even remember smugly pointing out that Gangsters Paradise (you know, the Coolio song) was sampled from Pastime Paradise many years later..I remember playing the funked up part of the song \\"As\\" over and over again in Highschool because I just loved that thick as lead groove...My point is, I was just a kid, but I guess I know now, what I knew then, and that is that Songs in the Key of Life, was and is a masterpiece-an important slice of musical history, by which all great soul albums would be measured from that moment on...It its an amazing musical ride--Brilliant!!!
B00000DQSV|3.0|Duran Duran is a band that has rarely summoned the energy or self-respect to make a completely worthwhile, high quality record. Though they've been making albums since 1981, only three of them (\\"Duran Duran I,\\" \\"Rio,\\" and \\"Medazzaland\\") have been excellent from start to finish.<br />Their laziness is on display here. \\"Notorious\\" was released in 1986, after the departure of guitarist Andy Taylor and drummer Roger Taylor, and can be seen as a product of the opposing creative visions of bassist John Taylor and keyboardist Nick Rhodes. During 1985, Duran had been split into two camps, with John and Andy making a dismal attempt at white funk with the abominable Power Station, while Nick, Simon, and Roger made the elegant and beautifully arranged \\"So Red the Rose\\" under the name Arcadia. When Duran reformed, this time as a trio, the collaboration produced \\"Notorious,\\" which works when Nick tempers John's funk pretensions with his arranging and keyboard skills; when John's ideas are at the fore, this album sinks miserably.<br />The title track is a brilliant funk exercise, with a sparse hook courtesy of Nile Rodgers' guitar and Nick's keyboards. Simon LeBon contributes both a fine vocal and a witty lyric. The second song, \\"American Science,\\" is an absolute tour-de-force, with Nick's understated synths finding a passionate complement in Warren Cuccurullo's searing, virtuousic guitar work (Rodgers and Cuccurullo share guitar duties on the album with Andy Taylor). \\"Skin Trade\\" is a sublime mixture of John's funk with Nick's lush musicality, and features fantastic singing from LeBon. Notable here, as on every track on \\"Notorious,\\" is Steve Ferrone's drumming, which is superb in its timing and precision; then again, it needed to be, considering the fact that he was standing in for Roger Taylor, one of rock's finest drummers.<br />\\"A Matter of Feeling\\" is a fine ballad, with an interesting keyboard arrangement from Nick and an excellent lyric and performance from Simon. From here on, however, the album is a decidedly mixed bag. \\"Hold Me\\" is reasonably good filler, but its arrangement has dated it. \\"Vertigo (Do the Demolition)\\" is a good track, despite its dumb lyric, but is followed by a truly embarrassing slice of poseur soul, \\"So Misled,\\" which has \\"skip me\\" written all over it.<br />Unfortunately, worse is still to come. \\"'Meet el Presidente'\\" is painfully bad, with a surplus of horns that fail to compensate for its compositional shortcomings and unbelievably stupid lyric. For some odd reason, they released this as a single, and it bombed in the US and barely scraped the Top 30 in the UK. \\"Winter Marches On\\" goes a long way toward redeeming this album, however, and evokes the best moments of Arcadia; this song bears the fingerprints of Nick, who amply displays his songwriting and arranging gifts here. Finally, \\"Proposition\\" ends the album on another weak note; though better than \\"So Misled\\" and \\"'Meet el Presidente,'\\" this still sounds like half-assed, pedestrian '80s pop/rock filler to me.<br />All in all, \\"Notorious\\" is a not-altogether successful merging of two pop sensibilities. Making it only to #12 on the US album charts, it officially marked the end of Duranmania. Warren Cuccurullo would continue to do session work and tour with the band before officially joining for 1990's disastrous \\"Liberty,\\" an album which is roughly equivalent in quality to this one. Their best work, however, was still ahead of them: 1997's extraordinary \\"Medazzaland.\\" Check that one out.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Didn't Spiderman have an alternate ending on the World Trade Center?  I wish that were included on a bonus disk.  They didn't even _mention_ it on the commentaries.  Oh well.  Gotta love Toby Maguire's performance (even if the Green Goblin was lame and the plot only so-so).  If it weren't for the humanity and realism that Toby brings to the movie, I'm sure I'd rate this only 1 star.
B00008MZ0N|5.0|For one, this movie is amazing! But i won't give away any of the plot by telling you, but it definatly lives up to it's name! This Movie is definatly a clean movie (by my standards) and any one 13 or over should be allowed to see this amazing movie!
B000089RVX|4.0|And that something is Evanescence. The best compliment I could give them is that they are one of the few bands being played in rotation on the top 40 (thanks to the single 'Bring Me To Life') that are actually interesting and fresh. Even though 'Bring Me To Life' has them labeled as a female-fronted Linkin Park (due in part to Paul McCoy's guest vocals), they simply surpass those comparisons on this disc. &quot;Fallen&quot; is just one of those CD's that is solid all the way through. Amy Lee has a voice that is nothing short of amazing. She carries each song and sings her lyrics with such emotion, conviction and frailty. She is definitely the best female vocalist to come onto the nu-metal scene. She is so good that she covers up the less-than-stellar musicianship presented on here. Not to say that the band is untalented, they are competent, but just nothing that matches the potency of Lee's vocals. She is definitely the reason this band is where they are today. This album has something for everyone; from the hard-rockers 'Whisper' and 'Going Under' to the highly emotional ballads of 'My Immortal' and 'Hello,' Evanescence have all the bases covered and hit all of the right notes. It's hard to not get into this CD. They possess a very likeable sound coupled with stunning vocals and personal lyrics. Definitely one of the better new bands to emerge this year.
0316666343|3.0|The Lovely Bones is not exactly a mystery, for we know \\"whodunnit\\" immediately, but it is fascinating to read a story written from the murder victim's perspective.  The plot involves the main character watching her family learn how to deal with loss, a community coping with the horror of the crime committed, and how \\"justice\\" comes about.  I couldn't put it down, but I must recommend this book with caution.  There is some sexuality (the main character longs for physical love that she never had a chance to experience) and a bizarre scene where another character is possessed by this dead girl.  Without these aspects, the book would be rated 5 stars, in my opinion.
0440539811|5.0|If you appreciate that James Joyce is an important author, especially 'finnegans wake' you'll have a good foundation for the Illuminatus trilogy. The prose is deep and at times feels like wading hip deep through swamp land. This, though, is done on purpose. It isn't un-readable like 'Finnegans Wake', its very readable but its not written in easy to read pop style for dummies. This book is not written for dummies. Average Joe won't appreciate it. Sorry. Illuminatus is a manifesto, a bible for some. Filled with sex, drugs and other offensive things. Illuminatus will be enjoyed by people who make it their business, nay their duty, to think outside the conventional box. This book lets you into a wild, crazy, upside-down world of intrigue, adventure sex drugs and rock and roll that is only partly a work of fiction. Its up to you though to guess which bits. The ultimate meesage of this book is think for yourself. Even this review might be lying to you.
B00008NG5V|3.0|This is Jack Johnson's second CD and I feel that it came up short.  Don't get me wrong, I am a Jack Johnson fan, but I was not very impressed with this one.  It is a good CD but does not have the variety that his first CD has.  I would recomend his first CD over On and On.
B000092ZYX|5.0|The best thing about a new Radiohead album is a genuine surprise.  With any other band, you do not get the same &quot;christmas morning&quot; apprehensions that come from not knowing what you are about to get.  On top of the that, it is great music.  The album includes songs that hit you hard from the very first 30 seconds you hear them, and I am sure I will find even more classics as I listen to it more over the years.
B00006WL2B|5.0|The Ninth Symphony represents one of my favorite pieces of classical music.  It has inhabited a special place in my heart ever since I watched the Bernstein concert at Brandenberg gate and I have linked that image with the image of the defeat of Communism.<BR>This piece is a multichannel hyrbrid SACD.  With the multichannel format you can hear the music filling your living room.  You can almost imagine the orchestra pit somewhere in the front of your living room.  This is the best format for listening to classical music because you don't lose much of the range of the music.  It is awesome.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have to admit, this isn't my kind of movie, but my husband is thrilled. He cites high quality, excellent acting and a moving story-line.
B00008LDPU|2.0|I was highly disappointed by the Animatrix. I would say that only four of the shorts are any good and two of them are downright terrible-&quot;World Record&quot; and &quot;Beyond&quot; I had to read reviews to find out what they meant and how, at all, they related to the Matrix. You can tell which ones are good just because they are the ones that were actually written by the Wachowskis'. I would definetly not recommend buying this, but renting it wouldn't be a bad idea. I was really hoping that these would shed some more light on the Matrix, but it did not at all. I think the problem was that the Wachowskis' gave way to much power to the Anime directors to change the stories. If they had kept more control then I think these would have been alot better and more served their purpose.
B0000033TE|5.0|Definately one of the best prog records ever.  And probably ELP's best, with only Trilogy coming close.  I love the energy, the aggression, and the technical pazazz of this band.  Greg Lake's voice is awesome as always; I find his voice to be powerful in the way a great wizard's voice is, haunting yet omnipotent.  Emerson on keys is nothing short of spectacular.  Palmer, kind of Ringo-esque, nevertheless pulls everything together making all the complex instrumentals weave together flawlessly.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I am 19 years old and a music major in college. Me and my music major friends saw this movie 10 times! We would sing and have so much fun. Thats what this movie is all about just having fun with the music. It shows that if u try hard u can make your dream come true. My fav line is \\"who said that marders not an art\\" Get your friends together pop this in and your sure to have a great time! I hope it brings you as much fun as it did me and my friends
B00008NG5V|5.0|For those of you who love Ben Harper and G Love this is a must have. I've been listening to G Love since day 1 and when I heard Brushfire Fairytales (Jack Johnson's First album) - I said &quot;Ok a few a good songs. Excellent style. Need more Content.&quot; - This album has more content.<br />Could use a little more quick tempo songs overall but #4(Taylor) and 7,8,12,13(Remake of Rodeo Clowns from G Love and Jack Johnson) are outstanding tunes.<br />Grab a beer. Grab your women. Sit on the deck. Watch the sunset and enjoy this album.
B000092ZYX|5.0|OK Computer interested many with its forward-looking, Orwellian paranoia.  Now September 11th has released people from the dream-world that gripped them during the 90s--a dream-world of infinite technological innovation, security, and a weightless stock market that seemed to be sailing to the moon, so to speak.  Hail to the Thief is an album that speaks directly to the world now, because of both the massive change in understanding and the evolution of Radiohead's sound.  Although for many, OK Computer still ranks as the best Radiohead album (and the best album of all time to a dedicate bunch), Hail to the Thief, with its deep symbolic resonances, simultaneous timeliness and timelessness, and aural beauty, offers a significant challenge.  I haven't decided which I like better yet, but I've only been with this new one for a few months yet.  Give it some time.
B00005JLPK|5.0|I think that this is the most underrated movie of the year! This movie was a wonderful interpretation of an artists life. Selma Hayek was wondeful in the film and fully deserved he nomination, maybe even the win (I have seen all performances except Nicole Kidman's, but this one is by far the best). The real surprise to me was the fact that Alfred Molina did not recive an Oscar nomination for the movie. He was wonderful as Diego Rivera. If there was a weak link in this film, It would be Ashley Judd. I really could not see why they picked her for the role. But, she only had one big scene in the film so it was not so bad. Antonio Banderas was only in one scene, but he played his part very well. As with Edward Norton, he played very nicely as the man who hired Diego to paint the mural in New York in a small but crucial role. Geoffery Rush gave a wonderful performance as the man who had fled from Russia into the home of Frida's father.<br /> This movie also had wonderful music, art design and direction by Julie Taymor(who directed The Lion King on Broadway). All in all, this was a wonderful film.
B00008LDPU|5.0|The Animatrix was always something I intended to pick up, but after I had more cash. While I love the Matrix, the semi-disappointment of Matrix Reloaded and the over-barrage of media hype that came with it made me want to lay off anything Matrix-related for awhile. But when I found the Animatrix for an exceptionally low price, I decided to snatch it up now rather than pay more later. And I'm glad I did.<br />I've browsed the other reviews here and a lot of anime/DVD sites, and can understand how the hardcore anime community might dislike the Animatrix. Some really bad dialogue seems to creep in now and then, and there are probably a lot more than the few anime cliches I picked up on (the feudal Japan training sim in the short \\"Program\\" is the most blatent one). However, this release still blew me away. For someone whose anime experience has been limited to watered-down American dubs like Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Ultimate Muscle, the animation in these shorts is jaw-dropping. Mind-blowing. Certain art styles fans will like more than others, but all of them have the high detail of anime AND the fluidity of American animation. It's the best of both cultures, and like the old saying goes, \\"I never knew it could be this way.\\" On a side note, also to be commended is \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\", the non-anime short that uses the \\"Final Fantasy\\" CGI graphics. I never saw Final Fantasy, and while the animation here was incredible, it still looked CG to me. However, certain shots of the main character(the Asian girl) looked so real I'd have sworn she was a live actor. Kudos to Square for making me believe.<br />As for the quality of the actual stories, I agree with the majority in that the four outstanding ones are Osiris, Second Renaissance I and II, and Detective Story. The others are open to a bit more criticism, and will each have their share of supporters and detractors, but I enjoyed all of them, and find that all the shorts are worth owning. Some great supplements are included too, including commentaries and an informative documentary on the history of anime. Either way, there's enough good stuff here for all anime fans to justify adding it to their collection. And if you love the Matrix, but think of anime only in terms of Pokemon, then I highly recommend you snag this eye-opening disc; you'll never view anime the same way again.ncluded too, including commentaries and an informative documentary on the history of anime.

B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona Apple's music stands out from anything I've ever heard before. This album makes the listner feel something and unlike other CDS you never have to skip a track due to the brilliant production of Andrew Slater.  One of the best of the best tracks on this album is &quot;Carrion&quot;- with soft and sultry verses and a edgy, hard chorus this song will just blow you away.  Her lyrical depth and raw vocal talent, that make this album so outstanding, is even more impressive bacause when she made this album she was still in her teens.  Her voice really shines on the piano driven tracks &quot;Slow Like Honey&quot; and &quot;Never is a Promise&quot; and although these are two of the longer songs on the album you'll get so lost in her poingnant words that you won't want it to end.  I would suggest that anyone who wants to experience amazing music and a brilliant singer songwriter should get this album now! A modern classic, Tidal is the album that changed my tastes in music, broadening them and opening my mind to new perspectives and new sounds.  So this is the end!  Go buy it!!
B00008OWZC|5.0|This CD shows why Zeppelin has always been and will always be the very best band.  Thank you Jimmy for all you did for us.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Been following Radiohead's musical adventures for some time now, and I've always admired how they've never tried to relive past glories, never making another Bends or writing another radio-ready &quot;Creep&quot;-styled song. I got 'Hail..' home and listened to it on headphones; from a technical standpoint it's probably the most amazing-sounding thing they have recorded. The production is flawless. <br />The material, on the other hand...It's a little hit and miss. For every swoony, accessable song (accessable for Radiohead) like 'Sail To The Moon', there's the droning electronics of a track like 'The Gloaming', a song that probably won't endear them to many new listeners. I like how the song 'Sit Down. Stand Up' winds up and explodes into a techno groove. 'Go To Sleep' and 'I Will' actually recall some of the old side of Radiohead in their melodies and arrangements, while Thom's vocals on 'A Wolf at the Door' chart new territory for the band. As an album, 'Hail To The Thief' feels more complete and cohesive than either &quot;KID A&quot;  or &quot;Amnesiac' did.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is unbelievably good.  Having seen a lot of bootlegs of the same material I'm so thankful that Jimmy took the time to give us this great gift.  We love you, Jimmy.  You did great, as always.
B000069KGM|5.0|Due to vast amounts of individual expertise and the countless gigs they performed prior to recording, Chicago's debut album sounds like the work of seasoned professionals.  The horn section is flawless, Danny Seraphine's drum-work is outstanding, and the guitar work of Terry Kath is raw and impressive.  The seven instruments, coupled with the 3 voices (bassist Pete Cetera, pianist Robert Lamm, and Kath), don't produce as great a variety of tracks, as they would on Chicago II &amp; III, but the song writing is still just as impressive.  'Introduction' showcases us to the many moods of Chicago, 'Does anybody really know what time it is?' and 'Beginnings' showcase Robert Lamm's smooth vocal talent, and 'Questions 67 &amp; 68' reveals that Pete Cetera could sing more than just the sappy eighties ballads he became known for.  Tracks like 'Poem 58' and 'Free Form Guitar' are showcase pieces for the underrated Terry Kath, whose Guitar work is viscious and rapid, and often as entertaining as Hendrix or Clapton.<BR>An outstanding piece of work on every level.
B00005JKG9|5.0|I have two words for this review...&quot;Jack Lemmon&quot;.  I think it's a shame that Lemmon didn't get an Oscar for this role.  I also believe that the 15 minutes that Alec Baldwin has in this film are the best and edgiest work in his repertoire.  I happen to be in the sales profession, although not nearly as smarmy this film, and the dialogue by the INCOMPARABLE David Mamet is some of the best I've ever seen on screen.  Let's throw in Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, and Alan Arkin for good measure.  The best ensemble EVER in my own humble opinion.  This movie evokes emotions on every level, from humor, disgust, empathy and sadness.  Please, go out and rent it today, or better yet BUY it...
B00008J4P5|4.0|Elephant opens with the driving riff of 'Seven Nation Army', a track that's sure to get you nodding your head.  The rest of the album doesn't have the same riff-based formula as the opening track.  In fact it tends to meander a bit.  Songs like 'Black Math', 'I Just don't know what to do with myself' and 'i want to be the boy to warm your mother's heart' really showcase Jack White's talent.  His voice is that of a born rock and roll singer's; sometimes sounding like Robert Plant, sometimes like Freddie Mercury, other times Bono.   His guitar playing is strong and Meg's drumming is solid, but the album lets itself down in consistency.  'In the Cold, Cold, Night' is cute, but doesn't warrant repeated listens, as does 'Well It's True...'.  <BR>Elephant shows that the White Stripes are still capable of putting some strong material together but have yet to make a fantastic album.
B00008K7AM|5.0|This movie is so funny! I could not stop laughing! My favorite character is Ling Ling's Mom who keeps interupting Ling Lings life and embarassing her- its hilarious
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck's work has been all over the map, from his simple guitar based, slacker-folk beginnings to his Dust Brothers assisted dabblings with electronic sounds.  Mellow Gold, Odelay, Mutations, Midnite Vultures, each was different.  Sea Change is another turn, although this time it's not such a new direction.  It's somewhat like a culmination of Mellow Gold's guitar-strumming with the production values of his latest albums. Even with the downcast lyrics, the result if beautiful to listen to. His depression over losing his long-time girlfriend is channeled into gems like &quot;The Golden Age&quot; where electronic noise underscores Beck's wounded singing.  &quot;Lost Cause&quot; and &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; are similarily sad and mellow, but still manage to possess a vibrant energy.  The album owes alot to the superb production of Nigel Godrich who fills many of the tracks with searing strings and floating sounds.  Having said that, it's still very much Beck's album. And it's one of the best I've heard in recent years.
0385504209|5.0|I enjoyed the book immensely.  Just a comment on the review from &quot;A reader from Evergreen, CO, United States&quot;: Please look carefully at Leonardo's painting of The Last Supper.  To the left of Mary Magdalene/John we see Saint Peter with a furious visage and a KNIFE (!) in his right hand.  His left hand is making a gesture of &quot;I'll slice his/her throat!&quot; across the throat of that figure of Mary/John.  It's there to see -- Leonardo painted it that way.  There is more to that painting than meets the eye -- and Dan Brown's book wrote it that way --saying the equivalent of &quot;There's more in heaven and earth than in your history . . .&quot;
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay feature something that many modern bands lack: a lead singer capable of singing.  Chris Martin's voice is lovely, perfectly suited to float from full voice to falsetto, while surrounded by the spiraling rhythms of dreamy-sounding electric guitars and crunchy accoustic strumming.<BR>'Don't panic' is a fantastic opener, setting the mellow tone that is upheld on the album.  Other standouts are 'Shiver', 'Trouble' and the wonderful 'Yellow', featuring great contrasts of power chords and minimal accompaniment, while Martin's at his best.<BR>      If you like 'A Rush of Blood to the Head', you'll definitely like this.  Coldplay's best.
0393057658|5.0|I received Moneyball in the mail yesterday and read it today. It moves along faster than the game ... and the message is applicable all over the map: people (and things) are overvalued or undervalued for reasons that have more to do with tradition and unproven paradigms than with relevant qualities. <br />Anyone who manages or hires, anyone who thinks there's something wrong with the current &quot;system&quot; (for doing whatever) can gain tremendous insight from Lewis's book. &quot;If professional baseball players could be over- or under-valued,&quot; writes Lewis, &quot;who couldn't?&quot;<br />Skip this book at your own peril. It's inspirational, in the best way: it doesn't ask you to believe in anything but the idea that we still can learn a better way.
B000002UB3|5.0|Contrary to popular belief, the Beatles did not make Abbey Road amongst viscious infighting. Rather, the album was recorded as a last hurrah, reuniting them with George Martin as Producer. The result is perhaps the best thing the Beatles ever did.<BR> There's Lennon's avant garde brilliance on 'Come Together' and 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)', McCartney's twisted whimsy on 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' and even Ringo's attempt at Yellow Submarine 2, with 'Octopus' Garden'. But it's George Harrison's songwriting that stands out here, finally stepping into the limelight with 2 of the albums best tracks: 'Something' and 'Here Comes the Sun'.<BR> Having said that, the \\"Medley\\" that dominates side 2 of the original album is what makes Abbey Road the legendary farewell record it was meant to be. Paul and John move back and forth between songs such as the wonderful 'You Never Give Me Your Money' and the amusing 'Mean Mr. Mustard'. The Medley moves into epic proportions with 'Golden Slumbers and 'Carry that Weight' eventually moving into a fitting trade-off featuring all 4 beatles getting a chance to solo. The album climaxes on 'The End' where the immortal final words ring home the message that the Beatles embodied. \\"In the end/the love you take/ is equal to the love you make.\\"<BR>This is a beauteous end to a mythic career. Abbey Road is perhaps the greatest album of all time.
B00008I8IF|3.0|or Sound of Lies for that matter. While I may not be a Jayhawks purist (I became a true fan after Smile), I prefer the Jayhawks' CDs, Smile and Sound of Lies over the country rock sound of Rainy Day Music. The tracks on Smile alternate between a polished pop sound and hard driving rock-n-roll.  After seeing the Jayhawks live for the first time a couple of years ago, I concurred with the rumor that the Jayhawks were the best bar band in America. While Rainy Day Music is great for a rainy day, the CD lacks any jams like the classic &quot;Baby, Baby, Baby&quot;
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin's second album is, depending on who you ask, their best.  While not as epic as IV or Physical Graffiti, the 9 cuts on II show Zeppelin at their riff-based best.  The songs are shorter, although many clock well over 4 minutes, and there isn't a weak track amongst them.  'Heartbreaker' showcases the legendary skill of Jimmy Page, while 'Moby Dick' is a testament to the drum-pounding ferocity of John Bonham.  Robert Plant delivers some of the best singing of his career and John Paul Jones strongly anchors the heavy sound with his booming bass.  This is fantastic hard rock, far better than the many imitators that followed, and the best of the Led Zeppelin studio albums.  If you like the genre, you'll love Led Zeppelin II.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I'll make no comments about hits or misses of the past. There won't be any reference to any magic that must have been used to create previous albums. Nor any request that they find the path they walked to compose our personal greatest hits that we sing at the top of our lungs in the car when we're alone. <BR>Hail to the thief is as accessible as Ok Computer allowing us to enjoy a track the first time around and love it the second. Now there is also a mixture of the fresh sounds that could be found on Kid A. However, this is where my comparisons to albums of the past must stop. The consistency that any great album needs is here and really isn't that what we've all been waiting for? An album that you can listen to...start to finish. <BR>Welcome back boys. Another hit out of the park. Welcome back.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This is a great album, that just grows and grows on you! It's safe to say that it can already be considered one of his best ever! You will NOT be dissapointed!
1400034779|4.0|#1 Ladies Detective Agency surprised me with it's style and strength.  It is the story of a very strong woman in Botswana who opens a detective agency.  She tells the stories of the cases that she deals with and solves.  Reading this book gives you the feeling of sitting around with extended family and listening to a sage old Aunt telling vivid folktales and imparting her wisdom in a humorous and touching way. The style was so different from the books I had been reading that I wasn't sure that I was going to like this book, when suddenly I realize I was entranced by the tale. It is a wonderful book, full of heart and I have already purchased the next one in this series, Tears Of The Giraffe and look forward to reading it next.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I had seen clips of the concert on one of the music channels on satellite and I just had to have this DVD.  Not being a big Pink Floyd fan or having any of the CDs, seeing the clips got me interested in perhaps giving the music a second chance.  I kind of strayed away from the music because of the imagery of the movie &quot;The Wall&quot; and the psychedelic culture associated with it.  But as I watched the DVD and saw David Gilmour with an &quot;older and wiser&quot; stage presence, I saw the music in a whole new light.  From old standards like &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; to an excellent orchestral version of &quot;High Hopes&quot;, David Gilmour puts a whole new spin on the music that was popular in years past.  This DVD is strongly recommended for people of all ages who enjoy wide ranges of taste in music.  This is coming from a twenty something that gave it a second chance.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Helpful? who cares? incredible!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I got this CD with some doubts. I listened to it over and over. This is definitely Linkin Park at their best. Worth buying without doubt. It is so good that it makes other bands look [bad].This album is nothing but the best of all of the albums currently out.
B00008QSA5|4.0|This new revised CD of the Original Super session really doesn't offer much unreleased material except for two songs without horns that were on the original and an unreleased instrumential-the album Super session is great but if you have the original release, there is not much new to offer here-except for updated notes and pictures--I bought it because I am a collector-but if you have the original and are not that serious of a collector of Bloomfield/Kooper-don't bother-get the Live at the Fillmore East album instead.

B000089QEN|2.0|I can not give an accurate criticism of this adaptation of Vanity Fair because I have only watched the first 25 minutes of the movie. I stopped watching and began writing this review because I wanted to warn people that the picture quality contained on this dvd is worse than bad. My 36 inch television showed so many video artifacts that it became distracting. I can accept the fact that it is only available in pan &amp; scan, what I can not accept is picture quality so bad and un-even that it looks as if it were dubbed from an old vhs tape. The people at A&amp;E really need to take a close look at how they master their dvd releases. I have also purchased Pride and Prejudice from them and I can tell you that, while it is one of my favorite productions, the dvd quality is sub-par (but nowhere near as bad as Vanity Fair). If you buy this release expecting dvd quality sound and picture, you will be disappointed.
B000089RVX|5.0|First time I heard this CD I was quite surpised at the intensity of almost all the work.  I found myself immediately hooked on My Last Breath mostly because I was seriously depressed that day and it was just one of those songs that seem to strike a chord!<BR>Simply put; this cd is worth the money to buy.  I only hope their next offering is as good.
B0000065O1|5.0|I started using this video several weeks ago and have seen dramatic improvements in my arms and legs.  Cindy does a great job of demonstrating the moves and then simply doing them.  I get very tired of the other videos that try to \\"encourage\\" you to keep it up.  The music is not the MTV-hyper music that most workout videos use.  There are no dance moves or girlie exercises.  Even my husband joins in on occassion.  This video does not get on my nerves.  I would recommend this to anyone who is up for a challenge, but it is deffinitely not for the weak.
B00005JKWJ|2.0|A totally different level of film making and professionalism compared to the original, and not in a good way.  The first had a cohesive sense of style, with good choices made in almost every aspect.  This one is just a hodgepodge of almost universally bad taste.  Somewhat entertaining, but highly overrated.
B000002I2M|5.0|L.A. WOMAN is the sixth and last studio album recorded by The Doors. Amazon has dubbed it an \\"essential\\" recording. I wouldn't argue with that. While it isn't my personal favorite Doors album, it's close. MORRISON HOTEL, their fifth album, saw the band turn to basics with a more bluesy, hard rock approach than on previous efforts. That trend was carried even further on L.A. WOMAN. While the album's hit single, \\"Love Her Madly\\", has a smooth, commercial sound, the rest of the cuts range from cryptic and edgy to dark and gritty. Titles like \\"Been Down So Long\\", \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\" and \\"Crawling King Snake\\" are more the norm. Jim Morrison's vocals have a gravelly and world-weary quality, but it works well in the context of his lyrics, which are sometimes brilliant. And, while the band turns in some nice instrumental work behind Morrison, the spotlight and mood are clearly his. \\"Riders On The Storm\\" is the Lizard King's eloquent and masterful swan song.<br />L.A. WOMAN is another outstanding album by one of classic rock's greatest bands. It also is apparently the best-selling Doors album. That surprises me, given that \\"Light My Fire\\" (off the first album) is probably the band's best-known song and was an enormous hit. It seemed at the time that almost everybody had a copy of that first album. That L.A. WOMAN outsold the other Doors records says something about how good it is. Most of the songs have a gritty and almost primal blues sound, and the performance is excellent. There isn't a dud anywhere. This is a genuine classic and something most blues and rock fans will want to have.
B00008G1KG|5.0|This, of course, is Jimi Hendrix's second album.  It's not as immediately accessible as his [[ASIN:B000002P5Y first album]], but it's great in it's own way.  It just takes a little longer to grow on you.  Hendrix continued to redefine what a guitar could do, in his own inimitable way.  It's great, but it.
B000092ZYX|2.0|This album proves that it is possible to blow your money on a Radiohead CD. Radiohead is a unique band that can play two completely different styles of music (prog rock and experimental) exeptionaly well. Unfortunatly, this album proves that they cannot bridge this gap. There are three good songs on this ablum; \\"there there\\", \\"where i end and you begin\\", and \\"a wolf at the door.\\" All the rest of the songs are [garbage]. For most bands, this would be an ok album, but I expect more from Radiohead.
6305014140|5.0|Three movies--Akira, Ghost In The Shell and Ninja Scroll--each broke new ground and pushed the genre in the mainstream. \\"Ninja Scroll\\" is the most fun and watchable of these efforts, and despite the fact that it was released in 1996, continues to be among, if not THE best, in ninja/swordsmanship movies.<br />This is one of those \\"three-watchers\\": watch once to get acquainted, twice to fully understand, and three times to get the full effect. You could very well leave impressed after your first viewing, but numerous viewings reveal more and more each time.<br />Wandering ninja Jubei Kibagami (based on a popular swordsman of Japanese lore) is drawn into a battle with the Eight Devils of Kimon, with the beautiful and lethal Kagero on his side, as well as a government agent. Jubei must survive battles with each of the Devils--a rock-skinned hulk, a blind swordsman, a portable wasp hive, a snake-controller, a re-animator/shadow manipulator, a wire-toting electrecutor, an explosives expert and a resurrectable boss--all the while attempting to solve a mystery revolving around gold, murdered villagers and a mysterious plague.<br />The animation is top-notch. It isn't thin and computer-like, as in Ghost in the Shell, but it's as close as you can get to a moving Marvel or Image Comic. Everything is lightning fast and no sounds are wasted: you'll notice every chirping bird or falling leaf with the tension that this film builds. The shots are masterfully beautiful--a charging Jubei is shown via reflection on the blind swordsman's sword held close to his face--and the animation is consistent throughout.<br />Not to confuse what you might have heard--the violence is extremely graphic, not the sex scenes. The sex scenes are nothing worse than what an R-rated flick might produce, but the violence is up there in the level of \\"Gladiator\\" or \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" but it's not something that goes throughout the movie so much so that it becomes disgusting.<br />The English dub is passable, capturing both Jubei's calm confidence as well as Kagero's fire, but like most anime, the Japanese version is the superior. The storyline remains generally the same in either version, although there are some significant, but not plot-disturbing, differences between the English and Japanese versions.<br />Each \\"Devil\\" is unique and cleverly thought-out, each a challenging fighter. Jubei is an anti-hero, reluctant to join the fight, and scraps his way through battles, using his smarts as well as his steel.<br />Definitely recommended for older fans, anime fan or not. It has anime's cliche graphic violence and nudity, but its plot, vocal performance and direction are excellent, among the best ever for the genre. Five stars doesn't do it justice.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Just as edgy and interesting as their last 3 studio albums, Hail to the Thief actually seems less forced, both musically and vocally than much of Radiohead's recent work.  This album is never boring or predictable, and presents a nice blend of raw energy and thoughtful composition not often found in today's music scene.  Listeners who were thrown by Amnesiac (which requires a lot of patience the first few times through) will find Hail to the Thief much easier to swallow, while die-hard fans who appreciate the ever-changing face of Radiohead will most definitely not be disappointed.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Like MANY others, I have always been a huge fan of Madonna's. <BR>But I must say, if she started her career with the type of material she provided on this album...she wouldn't have made it far at all. <br /> This album was poorly done. The only two songs that were even worth listening to, have been out for some time. <br /> This album is SO very disappointing! The lyrics are so poorly written...<br /> Many of the lyrics are repetitive. This is certainly NOT her best work. If she does make another album, I can only hope that it is half way better than what she came up with for this one.<br /> It may be time for her to start allowing others to write for her.<br /> Many of her songs contain the same messages that her songs in past albums contained. I certainly hope that future albums are MUCH better. This one is a flop...<br /> In a nutshell: better find another CD to make it worth your money.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead is one of those rare bands these days whose recording careers progress forward into uncharted territory.  If you've only heard &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; and &quot;The Bends&quot;, this album will take some getting used to as it's extremely complex in its sound compositions.  But for those of you who have been listening all along, you'll be instantly pleased with the results.  &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; synthesizes the lyrical style and tone of &quot;OK Computer&quot; with the experimental soundscapes of &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, resulting in a beat-laden collection of singable, memorable, and intelligent songs.  The music has a distinct 'indie' feel which is refreshing for a major-label release, and, of course, is what makes Radiohead so unique.  I *highly* recommend this album, especially to those people who loved &quot;OK Computer&quot; and want an inventive sequel.
B000083E79|3.0|I have never been a big fan of Cher's music.  I think she is better on the big screen.  I bought this album basically because I knew most of the songs and I do love Take Me Home and Bang Bang.  Some of the other ones arent bad but it is difficult to listen to an album that goes through so many different musical styles.  I would recommend it for anyone's collection regardless if you are a fan or not because there will be a few songs pretty much anyone would like.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Of course the only thing that these reviews are for is expressing your opinion.  Opinions always vary, and Radiohead is no exception.  For me, this could be the most impressive piece of work i have heard in the last couple of years.  The first day I had it I listened to it once, and could only wait 10 minutes or so before I had to listen to it again.  I have ended up loving all of Radiohead's work, and this one won't be an exception.  I highly recommend this album, whether your a fan of Radioheads early work, or more recent experimental work.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is an excellent historical novel that combines elements of Umberto Eco - \\"Name of the Rose\\" and \\"Foucalt's Pendulum\\" - Katherine Neville's \\"The Eight\\" with just a touch of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt.<br />No doubt this book has its detractor's especially those who are steeped in theological history, but it is not, nor does it claim to be, a textbook.<br />It is fascinating precisely because it does cast a speculative light on Judeao-Christian history.<br />It's a great yarn too. Robert Langdon, our modern day Indiana Jones and Sophie Neveu, who could be straight out of CSI, a cypher expert are on the trail of the Holy Grail. Clues are presented and solved with such regularity that crossword lovers would adore this book.<br />The pace is riveting and there enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing.<br />The ending has a touch of Hollywood, but so what?<br />Speculation, History, Religion, Conspiracy Theory. A book such as this has a bit of everything. No wonder the reviews are so diverse.<br />In spite of all that it is a good buy and a good read.
0671722905|4.0|Shakespeare is not my favorite author, although I do understand the concept of his Iambic Pentameter and its style and flourishes are highly regarded.  While I can appreciate the labor it must take to put a story in such format, I frankly find the poetics of it hard to read.  That makes the commentary (which is about half of this version) very helpful to people such as myself.  By reading the corresponding notes, I was better able to put the story together with the style, making for an exciting tale.  I would highly recommend this version to people who have difficulty deciphering Shakespeare's style.
B00007BK2N|5.0|Funny, moody, sublimely acted, and casting that is completely on target.  Even if you're not familiar with Manchester's post-punk music scene, it'll at least make you think about what you've missed.  Coogan is brilliant as Wilson.<br />Fantastic film.  I cannot say enough good things about it.

B000092ZYX|4.0|I see a lot of 5 stars for this album.  Everyone is entitled to an opinion but if Hail is 5 stars The Bends must be 7 stars.  <br />Hail To The Thief is better than both Kid A and Amnesiac but can't touch OK Computer or The Bends.  It is true that it combines elements of both the older and newer style albums.  <br />I submit this however:<br />If you combined the best tracks of Kid A and Amnesiac and compared it to this release the combined record would blow away Hail To The Thief.<br />I give it 4 stars because 3 1/2 is not an option.  It's good but hardly mind blowing like some past material.
B000092ZYY|5.0|This is a great mix of electronica and prog rock. Radiohead hit it on the nose with this one. This is one album to sit down and listen to a few times before you can fully appriciate it. With songs such as &quot;2+2=5&quot;, &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot; and &quot;Backdrifts&quot; there is room to believe this cd will be in my stereo for quite some time. The lyrics are angry as always but are expressed using symbolism and metaphors. This is definetly an album for you to pick up, and if you get the special addition you get a nice poster, and it comes in a weird box.
B00006LLNU|4.0|I am not going to write a thesis on why one should listen and enjoy or listen and trash.<br />The entire concept of this album is simple: Have listeners experience music and not experience the pre- fabricated fluff surrounding a CD.<br />Yes there is little packaging provided by the Label's promotional department to increase sales and that is the beauty of this project.<br />This CD is bound to be a rude musical awakening and for any member of a generation raised on the musical hype of Britney, N'SYNC etc...<br />I compare this CD to the classic 70s musical revolution that has since become referred by many as a masterpiece \\"Mike Oldfield TUBULAR BELLS\\".<br />You can only truly form an opinion if you venture to take the trip !
B00006CXXU|5.0|Hey CDnow.com peoples, don't you just h8 it when people review every track on a CD... Yeh i'm feelin' you<br />Well at first i bought this on impulse (i liked Dirrty and the covers) , i heard \\"Dirrty\\" and even though it's a Pop song, there's sumfin about it which drags me to it. <br />Well when i got home, i was nervous. I was a Britney supporter, if you brought up the DEBATE: Britney Vs. X-Tina. i would go for Britney even though i h8 her and her music. I brought her CDs for nuffin. And i thought \\"Stripped\\" would be like \\"Britney\\". but it wasn't. I was pressing next nervously. and at first i h8 Can't Hold... and every other track. Till i played DIRRRRRTY over and over again. i felt like crying. <br />Then i heard BEAutiful and went back to the CD. I listen to the catchy ones, and sort of liked it. Then one day... I started to discover all the tracks. at first it was<br />SOAR<BR>GET YOURS, GET MINE<BR>IM OK <BR>THE VOICE WITHIN <BR>LOVING ME 4 ME <BR>and now i discovered <BR>CRUZ& <br />INFATUATION... <BR> <BR>i love the interludes. <br />But i reckon... some tracks are a miss: <br />UNDERAPPRECIATED<BR>MAKE OVER... <br />This CD is a never before. Nearly all the tracks are wonderful. Even though it take time to get used to... <BR>Go Christina Aguilera......<br />I am a FAN. i dont care wat others think. she rocks<br />also Mariah's latest album \\"CHARMbracleet\\" .. try that as well
0316666343|5.0|This is a wonderfully written and suspenseful novel.  For me, I found it as a great bedtime reading and a novel I could not put down.  The writing style is very stimulating, and a book that you become so absorbed in that when you finish you really feel a connection with the characters.<br />Highly recommended!
B000002P48|5.0|This album is a rock perfection. All of the songs sound incredibly fresh, considering that it was released in late 1973. among all other rock giants with their complex studio polishing, and Lynyrd Skynyrd was totally anonimous band (from south).<BR>When I first heard this album (it was my first Skynyrd record), just after few listenings I made a state that this is best rock'n'roll album ever made. Ofcourse, you can't pick just one album as the all-time best, as there are a few dosens of them. <br />And this one is ofcourse one of them. It shows what's the rock'n'roll all about. It's not just southern rock (though influences are obvious) - it breaks throug the very essence of rock music. <br />The fact that this album, although their first, sounds so perfect, is because these guys heve been together for a long time before making this record, and was playing gigs around and rehearsing this songs. So they new exactly what sound are going <BR>to lay down. And it came out perfect, indeed. <br />This album is all: hard rock, southern rock, blues, bluegras even folk. It is pure and honest music with simple yet efective and beautiful lirics, like in &quot;Simlpe man&quot; (one of personal favourites). Also we get a big dose of humour in songs like &quot;Gimme three steps&quot; and &quot;Poison whiskey&quot;, delivefed with great riffs. No need to point &quot;Freebird&quot; as one of most requested rock song in rock history, along with Zep's &quot;Stairway to heaven&quot;, and deservely so. I could write a whole review just about &quot;Freebird&quot; and its trademark Skynyrd guitars. Ofcourse, I must mention &quot;Tuesday's gone&quot; as not great but PERFECT ballad rock song, almoust a prototype. And is there any better way to start this album than \\"I ain't the one\\"?  <br />So, this is as classic rock as you can get; everyone should own it. <BR>For those who aren't familiar with Skynyrd and like rock music (in genneral) this is great place to start your Skynyrd collection.Get this and be blown away... If you won't, you obviously don't know what's rock music about.
6305428425|5.0|Cute movie with much to look forward, it's so easy to fall in love with the charecters. Being in highschool, it really makes you want to enjoy what you can.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Kid A and Amnesiac, the last two studio albums by Radiohead, aren't exactly albums that can be called &quot;easy albums&quot;. That's why the band decided to leave their home city, the gray Oxford, and head to Los Angeles: their belief was that the Californian sun would help cheering them up and turn Hail to the thief into a piece for the crowd. However it is impossible to cancel the soul. Thom Yorke, guitar player, vocal and most important composer of the band found inspiration in the writings of the japanese Haruki Murakami and on the works of the contemporary musician Krzysztof Penderecki to compose other fews impenetrable songs - yet very criative and filled with guitar climates, as in &quot;2+2=5&quot; and &quot;Go to Sleep&quot;, which are comparable to Pink Floyd's best phase.
B00008OWZC|5.0|True story: I was listening to the radio in the car the other day, and I heard the two bar intro of Out On the Tiles... which surprisingly lead not into Tiles, but rather Black Dog. It was so LOUD and POUNDING and HEAVY that I thought \\"Whoa... what is this? Some hardcore deathmetal band doing a Zeppelin medley?\\" But as soon as the vocal kicked in, I recognized Robert Plant's voice instantly and I knew that it was indeed Zeppelin themselves, sounding more intense and virulent than they ever did on any studio album. I ran out and bought this as soon as I was able. This is something no Zeppelin fan should be without.
B000092ZYX|5.0|hail to the theif is one of the most anticipated albums to come out. but for waiting so long it has actually paid off. there are a few electric tracks. but if you liked the early radiohead you will love this. <BR>1. 2+2+5- this is a slow moving track in the beginning but then rapidly increasews the speed. 9.5/10<BR>2. Sit Down. Stand Up.- this is a very good track but i dont really dont like the repeation atr the end but it is still a good radiohead song. 8/10<BR>3. Sail to the Moon- this track is one of my favorite of all songs. it is such a beatiful and sad song. 10/10<BR>4. Backdrifts- this gets to get annoying. it is the same sound over and over again. it gets boring but gets to be good. 7.5/10<BR>5. Go to Sleep- now the good stuff is coming. this is what i want radiohead to be. 9.5/10<BR>6. Where i end and you Begin- this is one of the best songs on the album. it is so different and sad making it your favorite song from radiohead. 10/10<BR>7. We Suck Young Young Blood- this is one of those sad radiohead tracks in which the piano is only used. but then the bands come together. 8.5/10<BR>8. The Gloaming- even though this track is electric i love it. its like songs from kid a and ammestic but they dont suck that much. 8/10<BR>9. There There- this is the second best song on the album. it is dream-like, and well enjoying to listen. 11/10<BR>10. I Will- this song is just wierd. but you will appreciate this song. but it is again one of those suicidal songs but it is good. <BR>11. Punch up at the wedding- this is another good song. piano is excellent. 9.5/10<BR>12. Myxamatosis- this is a song you will always want to hear. it is weird at first but you will appreciate this song. 9.5/10<BR>13. Scatterbrain- this is my 3rd favorite song. it is good. 10/10<BR>14. A Wolf At The Door- this is the best song on the album. it is the best radiohead song made. it is like what you want them to be on their next album. 14/10<br />Overall- 11/10<BR>i hope on their next album they sound like this.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Thom Yorke has said in recent interviews that Hail to the Thief will be the last album from Radiohead as you know them.  Two years from now, he predicted, Radiohead will reemerge completely unrecognizable.  Given that Radiohead could release a blank CD and have the world salivate over it, the possibilities of Yorke's prophecy inspire both wonder and fear.  Funny that the band's new CD, Hail to the Thief, should do the exact same thing.  <br />Here it is, Radiohead fans - the final cumulative effort from the most original rock band in decades.  Thief sounds nothing like The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, or Amnesiac.  Thief sounds everything like The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, or Amnesiac.  It is warm.  It is cold.  It is accessible.  It is inscrutable.  It is gorgeous.  It is terrifying.  It is immediate.  It is distant.  And, above all else, it is fascinating.  For the people (okay, everybody) hoping Radiohead might warm up after their Kid A/Amnesiac double dose of nihilism, Thief does just that.  But it does even more.  Thief isn't another OK Computer.  If you want that, you may want to listen to... OK Computer (that is why it exists in the first place).  Instead, Thief is a cohesive mishmash of The Bends' immediacy, OK's layered guitar wails, and Kid A/Amnesiac's electronic gurgling.  The critical thing is that Radiohead, as a band, have improved in all those musical approaches, and the result is their most sonically diverse album yet.  Looking for proof?  Just consult &quot;2+2=5&quot;, a slow brooding echo chamber that, midway through, blasts into an electric-guitar fury that sounds like, of all things, a Pearl Jam song.  Or try &quot;Sit Down.  Stand Up.&quot;, a forbidding piano haunter that slowly and sickeningly crescendos into an electronic hailstorm.<br />Those two songs encapsulate all the power and dread Radiohead can generate, and that's only the first eight minutes of the album.  It speaks volumes of Radiohead that Thief is considered a &quot;sunny&quot;album, given that its mood falls just somewhere short of Suicidal.  But after the stark minimalism of Kid A/Amnesiac (two records so bleak you practically expected them to create a black hole in the universe), the trace of humanity Radiohead injects into Thief makes all the difference.  There's - gasp! - an acoustic song (&quot;Go to Sleep&quot;).  And Thief's best song, &quot;A Punch-Up at a Wedding&quot;, even dabbles in piano-tinged soul.  <br />What keeps all of Thief's pieces together is Yorke's one-of-a-kind voice.  Yorke has always sounded like a ghost from the netherworld, returning to warn you about the evils of mankind.  But Kid A and Amnesiac distorted his voice even further, depriving it of its immediacy without adding to its eerie qualities (except on Kid A's title track, the only Radiohead song I personally can't stand).  Here, Yorke's voice is more or less left alone, and it accents the texture of both the guitars and the electronic blips and quirks, particularly on companion pieces &quot;The Gloaming&quot; &amp; &quot;Backdrifts&quot;.<br />The band is also allowed to flex their muscles.  Freakouts likes &quot;2+2=5&quot; are accompanied by slow crunchers like &quot;There There,&quot; the lead single, and elegantly personal songs like &quot;Where I End and You Begin&quot; and &quot;Scatterbrain&quot;.  There's no lack of experimentation - &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; sounds like an orchestra of giant zippers, and &quot;Wolf at the Door&quot; is Radiohead's first Dylan homage - but all of it is exciting and never off-putting.<br />One could argue that Thief doesn't contain a signature moment of brilliance, such as &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; or &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;.  But it's the kind of album that reveals itself to you in new ways every time you listen to it.  Overall, it accomplishes the impossible - resurrecting the best of the old while refining the new.  And regardless of where they go from here, the one guarantee is that Radiohead will continueto go in directions that inspire surprise and amazement.
B000092ZYX|5.0|For years, since Radiohead's musical masterpiece OK Computer came out, people (especially the so-called \\"hardcore\\" fans of the band) have been fantasizing about them making another OK Computer, it gets pretty boring listening to these people reviewing Radiohead's subsequent albums and comparing them with it. Thom Yorke and company somehow foresaw this after the success of Computer, and stepped away from the album's formula -or any other formula, for that instance- and delivered two of the most beautifully bizarre albums in music: Kid A and Amnesiac. The first bore absolutely no resemblance to its predecessor, which helped the band avoid the silly comparisons, yet, when the later was released, everyone jumped at the idea of Radiohead being \\"back on track\\". Somehow, the electronic element in Radiohead's music suited poeple fine but everyone still wanted another OK Computer. Shame on you! Why compare works that are so intensely apart from each other? enough with the need for references. Isn't evolution what music is all about? Imagine Bjrk trying to make Vespertine a little more, say...      \\"Debut-esque\\". What would be the point???!!! <BR>Now, Radiohead have released Hail To The Thief, an album with -yes- more guitars in it than the previous two albums. However, this should be no reason for misleading listeners by telling them it's a return to the Ok Computer-era. Nope kids, this is futuristic music in its purest form, taking elements from electronica, guitar rock, and more. Every single song is a departure from anything done actually in music; and Yorke's captivating voice is certain to take you to higher places, no matter what track you're listening to. <BR>Considering all the reviews, and without even knowing it, I gave Thief its first listen seeking any reminiscence of OK Computer I could find; suddenly, I realized my mistake, and did what any MUSIC fan ought to do: I opened my mind and heard this album for what it is, a NEW Radiohead album, and it was only thenthat I fully understood the brilliance of this musical masterpiece; I listen to many different styles of music, and Radiohead never cease to amaze me. Despite what everyone keeps saying over and over again, each album represents a full reinvention for the band. So please, NO MORE COMPARISONS! <BR>If you have taken the time to read this far, I advice you this: Take NO advice considering Radiohead! Just get this album NOW! Because if you don't already own it, you might be missing out on one of the standards by which music will be measured in the future.
B00005B4GU|4.0|After Radiohead released &quot;Kid A&quot; in 2000, the band promised a return to guitars(they finally went back for this year's &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;), many fans felt a bit discouraged when a second record filled with experimentations and electronics would come out less than a year after &quot;Kid A&quot;. Despite some shortcomings, there's still some good moments on here to warrant a listen.<br />Packt like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box: The album opens with what almost sounds like dishes clanging, accompanied by a descending bass riff and repeated guitar note. The normally falsetto-like Thom has a more deeper voice for this one. One of my favorites. 9/10<br />Pyramid Song: Largely piano driven and some haunting sounds coming in the background. Ends with a large orchestral crescendo. Had a very little seen but an effective video. A stand-out. 9/10<br />Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors: Quite possibly the strangest track(and most oddly named) track to come out of the Kid A sessions. This is more of a sound experiment than an actual song. Not bad but I usually skip over it. 7/10<br />You And Whose Army?: Thom's vocals are way up front with taunting lyrics (&quot;Come on if you think you can take us on&quot;). Kind of gospel-y ending. Pretty good but I rarely play this. 7.5/10<br />I Might Be Wrong: Another one of the standouts led by a blues-like riff throughout. You can almost understand the lyrics as they're sung very distorted. Ends with quite beautiful chord arpeggios. 8/10<br />Knives Out: the most &quot;traditional&quot; songs on the album and my favorite on here. I've listened to this several times, not a hint of electronica. A quite catchy chorus(and sung very well). 9/10<br />Morning Bell/Amnesiac: A complete re-tooling of one of Kid A's standouts. Accompanied by slow guitar strums rather than guitar, an overhauled version but the lyrics and melody are still the same. While I like this version better than Kid A's, couldn't they record Follow Me Around or True Love Waits? 8/10<br />Dollars and Cents: Very strong bassline and with the string section rising and falling, sometimes overpowering the vocals. A very interesting listen, there's a LOT of stuff on this one, but it's an &quot;ehh&quot; track. 7/10<br />Hunting Bears: Short guitar instrumental. Very odd guitar tone. The guitars must be miked very close cause you can hear the hand movements on the neck. 8/10<br />Like Spinning Plates: Swirling noises at the beginning joined soon by what sounds like backwards guitar playing. Very distorted voice almost like it's being sung backwards as well. A very ominous and weird track. 7/10<br />Life in a Glasshouse: If you're a fan of 20's or 30's big band type stuff with the big trumpets and horns, you'll LOVE this. The track features veteran jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttleton. If you thought Kid A was out there, wait till you hear what sounds like classic big band updated. Good stuff. 9/10<br />While Kid A seems like a difficult-yet-cohesive and flowing whole, this feels like a bunch of tracks bunched up together. While most are a bit subpar, songs like the closer, Knives Out and Pyramid Song make this a worthy addition to their catalogue. Just one question: why couldn't they record Follow Me Around?
0060012218|3.0|I probably should have guessed by the size of the book (it'll almost fit in your pocket) and the title that the subject matter was geared primarily at teens..<br />That said, it was a very light read (I finished it in just over an hour and a half) but a cute story.  My only major gripe was that the \\"I'm gay, everyone's gay!\\" approach to the main characters was a bit too easy.. and the initial meeting of the main character and the jock in a chat room was rather implausible, (if you're a terribly closeted jock, why would you go meet someone who goes to your own high school 5 minutes into a chatroom conversation?) but nonetheless it was a cute, light, easy-to-read story.<br />Also recommend Bart Yates' \\"Leave Myself Behind\\" ..
B000005IU2|5.0|\\"Fun House\\" is truly psychotic, a 36-minute tour de force through pulsing, acidic hardscrabble wrapped in jungle rhythms and Iggy Pop's delirious consortium of mumbles and screams.  Somehow, it makes brutal, rudimentary primitivism sound almost transcendental, a considerable feat that sets it on a truly amazing plane of genius.  This overwhelming, uncompromising genius is twin-edged, as Ron Asheton's blazing, screeching guitarwork is underscored by the rock-solid rhythm section's quasi-Motown selections.  Dave Alexander's bass playing provides most of the melodies, which are strangely hummable and idiosyncratic, their overall quirkiness making \\"Fun House\\" far more multi-faceted and colourful than most hard-rock records.  Iggy's incensed growls make today's screamers and moaners sound trite, and his humourous side (an endless string of sexual references, the hilarity of calling the album's closer a 'blues' song) is priceless.  From the opening blasts of \\"Down on the Street,\\" (which sounds like the Rolling Stones playing metal in the Grand Canyon), to the pummeling \\"1970 (I Feel Alright),\\" to the cacophonous \\"L.A Blues\\" (a white-noise collage never to be matched in its squalling splendor), \\"Fun House\\" is indeed a bloody fun, blistering workout of staggering brilliance.  It slowly builds in intensity from beginning to end, and by its conclusion, one's callused ears are only eager to listen again and again to such a timeless, indestructible racket.
B000092ZYX|4.0|A return from the out-there sounds of \\"Amnesiac\\" to a harder sound more reminiscent of \\"The Bends\\". \\"There there\\" has many people saying \\"hey that sounds like Bjork!\\" and you'll know the track they mean when you hear it - it's early days yet and the label of \\"OK COMPUTER 2\\" is maybe not deserved but this really is an enjoyable yet challenging album. Listen with headphones and listen carefully, this is not background music. Radiohead fans are going to love it, consider it essential, but if you've not heard any of their music maybe start with \\"The Bends\\" or \\"OK COMPUTER\\".<br />WARNING: Many people are reporting that the CD they have received is defective - EMI have chosen to use \\"Copy Controlled\\" methods to screw up this disc, therefore it does not have the Compact Disc logo and is not a genuine Audio CD. The USA release may be unprotected, but most other countries are getting a crippled CD that will not play in Xbox, Macintosh, Playstation etc. at all and will only play low-quality 48k WMA versions of the tracks in Windows machines. Solution? Boycott EMI as much as possible, but make sure you get an unprotected CD or that you can return the disc if not satisfied.
B000002KXV|5.0|When CD's first started bacoming a popular format, I went to an electronics store to check out some equipment.  The employee there said, &quot;If you want to hear how really GREAT a CD can sound, listen to this!&quot; -- and put on The Nightfly.  It was an incredible experience.  Nearly 20 years later, I got a CD changer for my car, and what is in there?  You guessed it, The Nightfly -- funny, jazzy, sarcastic, and surprisingly warm at times.  On my list of &quot;top 10 all-time albums.&quot;
B000092ZYX|5.0|If you are not a Radiohead fan and never have been one, this album will not appeal to you.  For everyone else, this album represents a return to the days of the mid 90s  Radiohead 'rocking out' like on The Bends and Ok Computer.  However, they also are still into the weird experiments that made Kid A and Amnesiac so great.  This album represents a point in Radiohead's career when they want to challenge people yet still give us the guitar rock that made them famous.  The opener 2+2=5 represents this best: after a beginning of drum machine clicks and trippy guitars, the song explodes into every direction.  This song truly represents a return to Radiohead rocking out, something that was promised to us on Amnesiac but never happened.  Other standouts include Sail To The Moon, which is another brilliant Radiohead ballad masterpiece, similiar to Exit Music (For a Film), How To Disappear Completely, and Pyramid Song, Sit Down Stand Up, which to me is up there with Everything In Its Right Place and Fake Plastic Trees as one of the most beautiful Radiohead songs ever, Go To Sleep, which is very Ok Computer-ish, and A Punch Up at a Wedding, in which Radiohead explores jazzy guitar and piano over a drum machine.  I must add that the drum machine programming on this album is done to perfection.  Overall, this record is a modern masterpiece.  Radiohead have finally found a point in between their wild experimental tendencies and their desire to return to guitar rock.  Everyone should go get this and have their faith redemmed in modern music.  This album is a reminder that Radiohead is indeed one of the greatest bands ever and that the future looks extremely bright for them.
0609610570|3.0|Larry Bossidy is clearly a five-star leader, and Ram Charan is a gifted consultant and teacher.  It surprised me that their book didn't work as well as I had hoped.<br />Execution's title confused me.  Hopefully, you won't have that problem.  I thought Execution would be all about how to take a strategy and operating plan and implement them well.  Instead, Part III makes it clear that Execution is about meeting overall financial objectives through being an effective organization in setting strategies and operating plans to serve customers well while building an organization that can implement the plans for outperforming competitors.  Part I, by contrast, makes it sound like Execution is only about implementation, noting that almost all organizations have the same strategies (or can quickly get them from consultants), access the same top talent and can easily acquire and employ competitively effective innovation.<br />I also thought Execution would apply to all business people.  Instead, the context for most of the AlliedSignal (Honeywell International's name when Mr. Bossidy became CEO there the first time)  and General Electric examples which dominate the book is that of the CEO or group executive to whom  divisions report in a large conglomerate.  In this sense, Execution is like reading the latter chapters of Mr. Welch's book, Jack.<br />The main difference between Jack and Execution is that Execution tries to build a framework for the book's concepts while sharing examples (mostly of failure) from other organizations.  Mr. Charan's sections of the book mostly focus on that positioning.  Mr. Bossidy mostly tells about his own experiences at AlliedSignal and Honeywell.  Mr. Bossidy, of course, worked with Mr. Welch at General Electric for many years.  Mr. Bossidy reports that you could take execution for granted at GE, but that it was lacking at AlliedSignal when he arrived.  The two coauthors alternate in providing long monologues on the chapter topics and subtopics.<br />Three aspects of Execution are valuable to almost any business leader:  how to hold a strategy review  (chapter 8), building an organization (chapter 5) and the \\"Dear Jane\\" letter to a new leader (conclusion).<br />For those who would like to become CEOs and heads of divisions of large, disparate organizations, Mr. Bossidy's many anecdotes from his experiences at Honeywell International about how to do the leader's job will provide a valuable model that can be used repeatedly.  In many such organizations, there are no good leadership examples and this book can help fill the gap.<br />Here's the book's structure:<br />Part I:  Why Execution Is Needed<br />Chapter 1.  The Gap Nobody Knows<br />Chapter 2.  The Execution Difference<br />Part II:  The Building Blocks of Execution<br />Chapter 3.  Building Block One:  The Leader's Seven Essential Behaviors<br />Chapter 4.  Building Block Two:  Creating the Framework for Cultural Change<br />Chapter 5.  Building Block Three:  The Job No Leader Should Delegate -- Having the Right People in the Right Place<br />Part III:  The Three Core Processes of Execution<br />Chapter 6.  The People Process: Making the Link with Strategy and Operations<br />Chapter 7.  The Strategy Process:  Making the Link with People and Operations<br />Chapter 8.  How to Conduct a Strategy Review<br />Chapter 9.  The Operations Process:  Making the Link with Strategy and People<br />Conclusion:  Letter to a New Leader<br />Execution addresses these problems.  First, many company and division heads have little knowledge about the businesses or the most important functions and processes needed to prosper.  Boards, for example, often bring in a brilliant person who has performed as a \\"role player\\" elsewhere, and they cannot scale up into the CEO job.  When a company has had poor leadership, its processes and organization also become weak and it's hard to get anything done.  There are several poignant examples including Richard Thoman at Xerox and Richard McGinn at Lucent Technologies.  It's hard to fix that problem.  It took years at AlliedSignal and can be quickly lost (which happened in the two years after he retired the first time).  That's why Mr. Bossidy had to come back to restore execution (as he means it) at Honeywell International.  Lacking these perspectives, the business system is misdirected (see The Fifth Discipline).<br />Second, many leaders make bad assumptions about their circumstances.  Acting on those assumptions makes matters worse.<br />Third, companies plan to pursue strategies for which they lack the processes and organizations to implement.  The strategies need to match the ability to execute.<br />As a solution, you as leader must:<br />\\"--Know your people and your business<br />--Insist on realism<br />--Set clear goals and priorities<br />--Follow through<br />--Reward the doers<br />--Expand people's capabilities<br />--Know yourself.\\"<br />I was uncomfortable with many of the examples.

B000000W5L|5.0|Since the Rolling Stones are the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band, they must have made the world's greatest rock album. This right hear is it.  Yes, it is an odd duck for a great album,(only one hit single) but its still the greatest anyway(Only the Stones could record the greatest album in their guitarists basement). I could name eighteen reasons why, but that wouldn't really be true, because what makes Exile so great arn't the individual tracks, but the effect that the album has as a whole. A true work of art the album's murky, almost ugly sound gradually grows on you until you are hooked.<BR>   Rocks Off gets the album off to a bang from the gravely \\"Oh Yeah\\" at the beginning to Jagger's sexual innuendos, to Richards great guitars, to the very cool horns, Rocks Off simply is one of the Stones best openers and one of their best rockers.  Next up is Rip This Joint a freny of frantic Chuck Berry style RNR with humerous shouting from Jagger.  Hip Shake is one of my favorite Stones blues covers. The main riff sounds similar to ZZ Top's La Grange but is quieter with Jagger singing like he is in a trance.  Casino Boogie could be called Exile In A Nutshell because its slow methodical muddy sound which gradually builds up until Richards(I think) finishes things up with a cool guitar solo, completely sums up this albums sound.Also prototypical of Exile you'll notice that some of the lyrics of these first three songs are unable to be understood this happens throughout the album in most of the songs.  To finish side one of the tape is Tumbling Dice, the albums hit single and widely hailed masterpiece. One of Keith's greatest works.  Hear him send out those rich chunky guitar riffs.  I play guitar and can play Tumbling Dice, and it still mystifies me as to how Keith can find such a simple guitar riff and turn it in to a groove that has to be heard to be believed.  Side two brings out another side of the Stones.  It begins with the country blues of Sweet Virginia, my gosh what a chorus, what a harmonica, what a simply beautiful song. Just listen to Mick Taylor's acoustic guitar leads so gentle and flowing. What makes The Stones country songs so awesome is their originality.  They aren't quite authentic country, more like country to a RNR beat, no other band has ever been able to do this before or since.  Anyway, next is Torn And Frayed. One of the most facinating moments on the album. Many of the lyrics are hard to understand but just enough is left to make it clear that this is a quiet country ballad about drug dependency, speciffically Keith Richard's drug dependency.  I wonder if Richards ever recognized himself as the reckless guitar player named Joe described in the song. Sweet Black Angel is a nice folksy tribute to Angela Davis with an outdoorsy sound.  Loving Cup is a love song written for the underdog, as Jagger and Richards plead for a drink from your loving cup.  The second tape begins with Ricards singing in his best singing performance Happy. This is not sung well from a technical point of view but Richards sings and plays with such glee that it soon becomes one of your favorites. Jagger's background vocals supercharges the song.  Turd On The Run is one of those songs that isn't a hook right off the bat but after you hear it 30 times you notice that there is more to this country rambler than just Keith's frantic rhythm. Buried deep and I mean deep in the mix is a very hot lyrical lead guitar by Mick Taylor.  Ventilator Blues moans with desperation and is a much more authentic blues composition than I Got The Blues from Sticky Fingers.  Just Wanna See His Face is mocked by many reviewers but I find it very authentic.\\"Don't wanna walk and talk 'bout Jesus, I just wanna see his face.\\"  Let It Loose is the song that Jaggar is supposed to carry by himself. He does it brilliantly.  The song itself digs back into some of the band's gospel and R&B roots.  The female singer that hangs over at the end sounds so beautiful that I would like to jump into the radio and kiss her on the cheek. Side Four starts with All Down The Line a brilliant rocker that mushes blues, R&B, RNR, and gospel into a little something that I call music.  Stop Breaking Down is another one of the Stones better blues covers, showcased is Jaggars ragged harp, and his ability to sound really mean and ugly, and also Taylor shines with a rough and dirty slide. Shine A Light is about Brian Jones and is perhaps the most beautiful song that I have ever heard before. Jaggar probably sings with more emotion here than anywhere else, Billy Preston gives us the most beautiful chord progressions I have ever heard which sets us up perfectly for two of Taylor's beautiful lyrical guitar solos.  Soul Survivor is another song that mixes everything together in All Down The Line fashion but sounds completely different from ADTL.  Richards bass is hypmotising on this number what a versatile musician when he is on his game. <br />   In conclusion Exile is the best album ever. Though it really is best listened to as a whole but I do have some favorite tracks: Rocks Off, Tumbling Dice, Sweet Virginia, Torn And Frayed, Happy, Turd On The Run, Let It Loose, All Down The Line, Shine A Light, Soul Survivor.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead are doing something pretty strange to music. If you haven't been stupefied by them up to now, this record will push you over the edge. &quot;Hail...&quot; is a great record, but where the hell do you look for it in your local Tower Records??<br />That's what I want to know...
0446530573|3.0|I am not a big fan of the show,nor am i a good cook, but i was very pleased with this cookbook. I often read cookbooks for enjoyment not for recipe guidance and this one seemed to be made for me.<br />It is, of course, based on the hit show.  The chapters are divided into characters (instead of the usual food categories-dessert, main meals, appetizers, soups etc).  It has a lot of pictures from the show and of the food.  Their is an index for those looking for a particular recipe.  The chapters features letters, comments, thoughts from the characters which any fan would enjoy.<br />This cookbook is a fun read and is a tongue in cheek version of a cookbook- you can tell right away that the purpose is entertainment.  The recipes seem like your typical hearty Italian fare- not for those counting calories!
B00000I8DY|5.0|This performance is arrestingly different. Almost every number is shaped in a new and exciting way by Jacobs (not always convincingly) so that one feels he/she is listening for the first time. So many small details pop out, so many different accents which change the shape of a phrase delight the ear. The orchestra is superb. The singing is also excellent, but a little faceless. All the singers characterize well and are technically able, but their timbres are a shade anonymous, save for Fink. That said, this is singing and playing of a high order, and everyone seems to actually have an idea about their music making and characterizations. My one qualm: Why oh why do manufacturers divide the cd's up in such stupid ways? Both Cd 1 and Cd 2 end on the recitative preceding an aria. These recitatives are integral to the number they introduce and should have been on the following cd. This is easily accomplished here since the recitatives are about one and a half minutes long. The cds could have finished on the arias preceding and then the next cd started with the next recitative and its ensuing aria. Don't these manufacturers use their own products? In any event, superb performance and recording nonetheless.
B00006LIRI|5.0|I like U2.  Despite my fears, this album does not sound like a rehash of U2, even though it's a best-of compilation.  I recommend it just for the Electrical Storm track, which to me is the most moving, powerful U2 song in years.  Also, Beautiful Day and Stuck in a Moment, truly great U2 songs, are reasons to buy this disc if you don't own them on an album.  These songs, especially Electrical Storm, remind me of the heyday of U2 when people were first in awe of them in the 80's and early 90's.<br />There are a host of other tracks that I forgot about from the mid 90's along with some I have not heard before.  They are yet another reason to own this disc.  You won't be dissappointed even listening to the Achtung Baby tracks (which were played to death in the early 90's).<br />Put this disc on and you will listen attentively to every song from start to finish.  It's that good.  And it's great to know this band still has that kind of effect after all these years.
0316666343|5.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is the kind of book that haunts you even after you stop reading.  It deals with very difficult issues, like rape and murder.  However, the story rises above the dark subject matter.  Although the story doesn't end with sunshines and rainbows, the ending is fitting.
0743201140|4.0|This book provides some key insights, but is a bit thin in relevant content - especially for those looking to leverage strengths.  <br />Some of the books solid points:<BR>1 - Focusing on strengths is a contratrian idea in many companies, and it is very important for people to know that focusing on their strong spots is up to them.<BR>2 - The online survey is a very informative tool - perhaps the most useful diagnosis I've taken.  After using it, you'll say, &quot;Wow, that makes sense!&quot;<BR>3 - The book should open your mind as a manager to staffing, leadership and development opportunities.<br />Weak spots - even if we're not supposed to focus on them :-):<BR>1 - With the descriptions spread over so many strengths, the reader is left with a lot of fluff and unread material if they're focusing on self development.<BR>2 - The book tends to be written as a group of large lists, with detail on each strength.  A theory tying them together would be helpful for putting it into practice.  The average manager is hard pressed to use such a thick catalogue.<BR>3 - Fixating on 5 strengths seems a bit restrictive.  Maybe some people have 3 or 4 or 6?  It would be useful if the tool could give relative weights or scores on them as well.<br />In summary, the book is best used as a survey for folks interested in a self assessment.  More depth (a follow-up book?) is needed to put the ideas into general practice.
0375414053|4.0|I thought this book was great.  Kate was a really likeable character, so it was really easy to root for her as she tried to find balance in her life.  I thought the ending was a bit of a letdown, but the rest of the story makes up for it.
0316096199|5.0|This book was a hauntingly good read.  I spent 3 days reading this book in between work and caring for children - while I cooked dinner, while I fed the baby, whenever I could.  It's the type of book that you can't put down because you really can't predict what's going to happen.  Alice is a unique individual, and this story is written with such clarity and honesty that I actually had nightmares from it.  Never had I thought so long and hard about the brutal aftermath of a rape - it was very enlightening.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|This was the first \\"Evil Dead\\" movie, and apparently the only one to be conceived as a \\"serious\\" horror film. As such, it tries harder to be creepy and disturbing, while mostly eschewing the wacky humor that took over the sequels. And it works. The plot is minimal: five college students take a trip into the woods to an abandoned (?) cabin and accidentally awaken the forces of the undead, which possesses them one by one and turns them into zombies. The only way to kill such a creature is total bodily dismemberment, hence the fact that the movie was deemed too gory for the MPAA ratings board. For a film shot on such a small budget (reportedly about $300,000), \\"The Evil Dead\\" makes the most of it with ridiculously bloody effects, inventive camera work and enough energy to easily overcome the cheesy acting (although Bruce Campbell is charming as always). It's not as witty or clever as the follow-up, but if you can stand the blood, \\"The Evil Dead\\" offers plenty of chills and thrills.
0679746048|4.0|This story was powerful with such devoted characters it gave you a real sense of what it is like in a mental institute. the people you meet all the sickness and pain that each character endures a very powerful novel it is much better than the movie
B00006L83N|5.0|This album, in my opinion, is very well achieved, production is awesome and songs are more in the style of &quot;Divine Wings of Tragedy&quot;. However, I think the best Symphony X album is &quot;V&quot;, it is their most ambitious project and it explores more the progressive side of the band. I recommend buying this album, but if you are mostly a prog fan than a metal band, buy &quot;V&quot; first.
B000096I9G|5.0|\\"The Cure-Trilogy\\" is the best concert dvd I have seen and I have quite a few. It feels as if you are there watching the band play(and I must say the light show is dazzling). The \\"Pornography\\" set, featuring an album from 1982, sounds fresh and powerful. The drums and the bass on several of the songs sound punchy and crisp. There are also little camera effects which add so much to the show. The \\"Disintegration\\" set has an epic feel, with keyboards coming up front and tons of layered guitar. Many of the songs are emotional and the blue colors of the light show set a mood for the set. The final \\"Bloodflowers\\" set contains several wistful and beautiful songs as well as a few heavy, energetic songs. The show is definitely The Cure's best I've seen in a live setting. All of the instruments have room to breathe and there is a high amount of dynamics in each song. \\"The Cure-Trilogy\\" is the best purchase if you are a huge Cure fan. The 3 albums, although dark, are The Cure's best moments in their career. If you are a fan of the darker Cure albums, pick this up. If you are a fan of the happier Cure stuff like \\"Friday I'm in Love\\" or \\"In Between Days\\" you should still pick this up to see a different side of this wonderful band. Cheers to Robert and crew!
0375432302|5.0|Wow, i just finished this book and i thought it was one of the best books i have ever red. Usually i am not one to read these kinds of books but my dad red it and loved it so i thought that i would see what it was all about. I couldn't put it down. It was just so compelling. It was as if it kept whispering to me to keep reading (I'M NOT KIDDIND)some of the things i did find a little far fetched but i thought that that just added to the fun. Over all, i thought i was SOOO good that i would recomend it to almost anyone!!
B000000H5J|4.0|I'ma keep this one short.  This is a good CD, but definitely not fear factory's best. That honor goes to their final album, digimortal.  If you're into fear factory get this one, if you don't listen to them much, get digimortal.  &quot;body hammer&quot; and &quot;self bias resistor&quot; are the best songs.
B00004WGAI|5.0|I have always loved the book Jane Eyre, although when I was a child I imagined Jane to be pretty - against everything Ms. Bronte had written regarding Jane's appearance.  I love the book so much that I hesitated at first to watch a movie version.  As I watched this BBC production, to me it was just as if the book had been transformed into pictures.  Although I agree with another viewer that the young Jane left a little to be desired, and it seemed as if much of young Jane's life was condensed and occurred rather rapidly, as soon as Zelah Clarke takes over it doesn't even matter.  For the life of me I could not remember her name for a few years when searching for the video again.  She was, and is, Jane Eyre to me.  She is exactly as Jane Eyre should be, both in looks and manner.  She is mostly quiet and still, and then suddenly passionate.  She is plain yet not unattractive, and then she smiles or laughs and her face is suddenly lovely.  Timothy Dalton was definitely more attractive as Mr. Rochester than I expected, but he portrayed Mr. Rochester's odd humor in a way that I had missed from simply reading the book.  For a Jane Eyre lover this movie will be a visual representation of Ms. Bronte's beloved story, and therefore is not to be excluded from one's library.
B00008LDPU|2.0|Ok, I've waited for this DVD since I found out about it. It was preordered and shipped. I popped it in and ... flat lined! If you are an anime freak, than this may be something to add to your collection when the price drops. But if you are looking to get a real feel for the Matrix story background, seek alternative sources. Before I jumped on the bandwagon and clicked buy, I should have had a better sense of what I was getting. I wanted something that would go over the FULL past of the Matrix, i.e. the first surviors and the founding of Zion. But the only story that even seemed in line to what I thought I was getting was the first chapter, the final flight...which I watched last because of a button mishap. Before viewing that I was crushed! This is definitely a rent first, or borrow DVD. I'm not sure how you can ride the fence about this one. You either liked it or hated it. If I could rate on workmanship I would rate higher, however I'm rating on story-line only...and again, it was a HUGE let down.
0679805273|5.0|I just love this book! It's the perfect gift for someone who is just starting college, graduating, changing jobs, careers, or any new venture. It focus's on the journey of life, and that you will come out on top throughout the ups and downs.<br />Really great for any age! Highly recommend! Colorful, cheerful, happy book!
B00005JM03|5.0|\\"The Italian Job\\" is your classic summer movie:  one villain, one hero, one beautiful intelligent woman, one computer geek, one ladies' man, one explosive expert, shake, stir, add a bunch of car chases, a few last-minute surprises, voila.  The story is about a group of master thieves led by Donald Sutherland cleverly steal $35 million in gold bars from a safe in Venice, only to have it stolen again.  The group must pursue the villain to get the gold back, using Mission-Impossible style technology and an enormous amount of wit.  <br />Two things raise this far above its genre:  absolute super settings: a boat chase through, under, and around Venice; a set of tricked-out Mini-Cooper cars vrooming through the sewer pipes of LA like kids through a water slide.  Really fine performances:  Donald Sutherland as the patriarch of the thieves, Seth Green (Scott Evil from the Austin Powers movies) as the funny computer geek, and the supremely creepy Edward Norton as the villain.  Only Mark Wahlberg fails to project much of a personality.<br />The thing I appreciated most is that none of the action was faked by computer:  it's just good old-fashioned stunt-driving.  It's really pretty impressive (it's 'actually happening'); as much as you might have liked this summer's Matrix movie, this one is at least as thrilling because it's 'real.'
B00003CWPL|1.0|A mess. Don't waste your time. Two of the most overrated film directors of all time are Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch--oh yeah, Hitchcock is another one. <br />Jack Nance did a nice turn in Bukowski's Barfly, though. Check it out.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Radiohead have reached such a high level on their previous releases that I was willing to purchase this album without having even heard the first single &quot;There There&quot;, and I was not disappointed. After a subtle begining the opening track &quot;2+2=5&quot; kicks in with more guitars that their last two albums combined. This is short lived however, with the next track reverting back to the electro experimental sounds that have alienated many fans over the last five years. Only two other songs on the album continue in this vain with the remainder of the 14 tracks built around traditional live instruments. Elecronic touches are still evident in many of the tracks, but in a similar way to Blur's &quot;Think Tank&quot; do not dominate the mix. While this album is far from &quot;OK Computer 2&quot; as many fans had hoped for, it is far more accessable to the casual music listener (and radio programmer) than either of their previous two albums.
1565847032|4.0|Chomsky should be read by everyone as he does have an excellent grasp of the evils of our system.  His major flaw in general is that he doesn't usually present events in the whole of their context so further research into any topic he discusses should take place prior to taking his information out on the street for debate.  Keep a flexible mind and you will learn a great deal.

B00008J4P5|5.0|On the strong recommendation of a friend, I reluctantly gave it a listen and was pleasantly surprised.  I rarely adapt to new bands, but found a half dozen tracks that jived well with my tastes.<br />Favorites are, of course, 7 Army Nation as well as Girl - You have no faith in medicine, Black math, In the cold cold night, The air near my fingers, Hypnotise, The hardest button to button, and Little Acorns.<br />Little Acorns has become an in-joke hit at my office.  Whenever problems pile up, the advice we give each other is &quot;Be like the squirrel&quot;.
B00008OWZC|5.0|GODDAMMIT! i cant believe that John Bonham is dead whats his problem im only 14 and i want to see them live! ARGGGG!  thse guys are amazing and for a guitarist the are a deam comee true. this live recording could rival Live at Leeds (the Who) amazing stuff! definitley worth every penny. Buy it now. (plant is hot) (page is lazy) (banham is god) (jones...hides)
B000007T1M|4.0|System of a Down quickly establishes their pattern on \\"Suite-Pee\\" with catchy riffs, drumming which alternates between lurching and funky, and Serj's [angry] yelling.  The album continues in this effective pattern, with the lyrics focusing more on larger social and political issues than self-pity (to their ever-lasting credit!).  This album isn't as good as Toxicity because the art-rong songs, \\"Spiders\\" and \\"Mind\\" aren't as good as \\"Chop Suey\\" and \\"Toxicity\\".  They're good songs, as are the less ambitious ones, but that's the difference between the two.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|ok, first off i am compleatly aware that this is just another chance for the label to make some more cash off of this band, but that doesnt make the songs terrable all of a sudden. im giving the songs a five cause thats what they honestly deserve any true beatles fan would do the same. if you dont want the record company to make any money off of this cd then just buy the original records. huge beatles fans have all the songs already, but if your starting out on them this is a great start for you.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This dvd set is aweome.  Not only are the ten episodes simply great viewing, they tell the true stories of some truly great American men.  The filmmaking is incredible, above the warfare cinematography of Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down and We Were Soldiers..., (all of which were excellent movies) and all other war movies, in my opinion.  There is just something so gripping about WWII, that other movie conflicts seem to pale in comparison.<br />The special features on each disk are very nice.  You get biographies of the Easy Company troops that appeared in those episodes, a list of ranks and insignia, and other goodies.  There is a great \\"making of\\" vignette, and behind the scenes photos, too.  This is a simply great purchase, though the cost is kinda high.  Of course, it is worth it, esp. since there are so many disks in it, but in one shot it is a little painful.
B000002HEP|5.0|In the last 15 years certain bands have contributed to the hard rock/metal genre in monumental ways.  Master of Puppets, Vulgar Display..., Chaos A.D., Opiate, and Sky Valley (+ some I left off of coarse, that you're probably thinking of reading this and cursing me for leaving off,) but the point here is this is one of those rare albums that comes along every so often where everything just clicks, everything comes together just right to form a perfect album.  Are there could of's, would of's, and should of's to this album?  Yes, but that's what truly great albums inspire, arm chair criticism that seeks to refine true attempts at the awe-inspiring album.  This is a definate time defining moment where 4 members of a band put out what will always be; what we remember them for.  AMAZING. Purchase without prejudice.
0446677450|5.0|When I first picked up this book I was impressed at the easy storytelling style. I hadn't had this feeling since I read the \\"Richest Man In Babylon\\". <br />This book is spiritually and psychologically transforming. Mr.Kiyosaki lays out how wealthy people think and why its easy for them to make money constantly and consistently, where even the most educated of us struggle needlessly.<br />This book is transformative in the easy way it makes you come around to its way of thinking. Because of this book I ended up writing three books of my own, all of them available on amazon.com<br />With all of the books shortcomings you can tell that Kiyosaki is interested in one thing and one thing only, your well being. He is sincere about his four pillars of success and in that sincerity you want to change.<br />This is a powerful book and sits in my top ten lists of motivatioinal books.
B00004XONN|4.0|Tonight, while my 2.5 yr old was in the tub, her Daddy was enjoying this album.  Scientifically (objectively) I asked her what she thought of this music.  She stated, \\" Well, it is a little strange, I think.\\" A couple minutes I asked her to use a feeling word to describe this music and she said, \\"It's angry music, maybe not very nice.  It's too loud for me\\".  When Dad came into the bathroom to check in on us girls, I told him what she said.  He laughed and said that it's the kind of music you have to get used to.  She's ready for a little Raffi.  Overall,   the owner of the album would give it a 4, but this is definitely not a child-friendly album.
B00005R2M3|5.0|When I first heard of Shakira, I had the assumption that she wasn't much different from Britney or Christina or any of the other imitations.  The only difference was that Shakira was from another country.  It turns out that I was mostly wrong.  I didn't know that Shakira learned English just so she could write her own songs in this language.  I also didn't know how catchy and fun her music is.<br />The two songs that the most well known are \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" and \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\".  Both are good songs with a lot of energy.  Shakira seems to be at her best when her songs are fast paced and high energy.  My favorite song on the album is \\"Eyes Like Yours\\" and I think it the energy of the song that I love.  Her slower songs do not quite measure up to the faster ones, but I'm not sure there is really a bad song out of the bunch.  \\"The One\\" is a slower song and is a nice change of pace for the album.  There are also 4 tracks in Spanish, and while I don't speak or understand very much of the language, I can still enjoy the songs simply because I think they sound nice and are fun to listen to.<br />I only borrowed this from the library, but I'm very glad that I gave the album a chance to listen to.  It exceeded my expectations and I wouldn't be ashamed to have it in my collection.
B00005LMBK|1.0|Here's a great idea! Since nobody likes stupid techno music, Why don't we have the \\"mucicians\\" hide behind the scenes and have a bunch of badly drawn cartoon characters play the \\"music\\". Everybody loves cartoons right? Wrong! You'd be better off buying a real life gorilla to destroy the CD for you. What I just said makes no sense and I am aware of that but you really shouldn't waste your money on this CD.
6303402348|5.0|FORREST GUMP is a movie about a backward young boy who grows up to lead a remarkable life while managing to get involved in some of the most important world events of the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon years.

B000062YB1|5.0|This is Slayer's best. If you were more into Metallica in the eighties and thought Slayer were too crazy, this is the album for you. It's their most accesible. I usuallly say \\"The heavier the better\\" but this is an exception. It feartures some of their best songwriting ever. this is more a thrash album than a death metal album. Being a fan of of Classic metal, Thrash metal, Nu metal, death metal, black metal, rap metal and punk I can say that this is one of the greatest albums ever and definetely worth the money. Slayer's best by far. (Reign in Blood is second best, still awesome but not even close to this.)
B000002IR7|2.0|This is what happens when a group of guys have an unexpected monster smash hit. In 1962, while in the studio jamming, a seventeen year old prodigy named Booker T. Jones, a twenty-one year old guitarist named Steve Cropper, and a couple of veterans of the Memphis music scene came up with something that Stax Records president Jim Stewart deemed good enough for release. Needing a B-side, Cropper suggested working up something Jones had been playing around with some time earlier. What was supposed to be a B-side excited Cropper, and local DJs quickly began to flip the &quot;Behave Yourself&quot; single to the other side, and &quot;Green Onions&quot; began to create quite a stir. Quickly, the sides were reversed, and &quot;Green Onions&quot;, with it's groovin' riff, Booker T.'s funky organ lines, and cutting edge guitar bursts courtesy of Cropper became Stax's biggest hit at the time, reaching number three on the national Pop charts and topping the R&amp;B charts. The group, now billing themselves as Booker T. &amp; the MGs (Memphis Group), released this solid, if unspectacular instrumental album later that year.<br /><br />As could be expected, they weren't really able to recreate the hit single's magic, and besides that title track, the rest of the album comes across today as sounding pretty dated. This album should not be bought to familiarize listeners with Booker T. &amp; the MGs. Cropper, Jones, drummer Al Jackson, Jr., and later Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn (who would replace original bassist Lewie Steinberg) are widely considered to be the tightest, most soulful, and versatile band of all time. They would go on to be the house band at Stax, playing behind Otis Redding, Sam &amp; Dave, Albert King, Eddie Floyd, Johnnie Taylor, Rufus and Carla Thomas, and more. They provided the blueprint for Soul music, and set a standard of excellence that nobody since has come close to meeting. On their own, they released over a dozen brilliant singles, and several terrific albums.<br />However, other than the timeless title track, there is nothing on the album that is a &quot;must hear&quot;. And &quot;Green Onions&quot; can be found on MGs compilations, box sets, and countless soundtracks. Make no mistake about it though, the album, for what it is, is quite good. This isn't a garage band rushing to sell an album cause they had a hit. Lewie Steinberg was very accomplished, and Al Jackson, though just a few years older than Steve Cropper, had been playing in his father's Jazz/Swing band since he was five years old! And as well as Cropper's groundbreaking work on the title cut, the young white guitarist showed himself to be equally adept at both Blues and Jazz. His playing is both simple and sophisticated, with the underlying element being taste. And Booker T. Jones played like no seventeen year old kid. This being said, there is no real reason to recommend this album, unless you are already familiar with the MGs' greatness, and you want to hear everything they recorded.ums.<br />However, other than the timeless title track, there is nothing on the album that is a &quot;must hear&quot;.

B00005B36H|2.0|The thing i liked about Tool was their originality. No other bamd ever sounded like tool, even though some tried (earshot anyone?)With this album Tool pretty much ditched heavy metal altogether... It's not a bad album, just not up to Tool standards...
B000092ZYX|5.0|I've been a Radiohead fan since Pablo Honey.  I absolutely loved The Bends and OK Computer.  Kid A was okay, but very different (obviously), and I never got into Amnesiac.  When I heard that the new album would be a bit more like their older stuff, I was excited.  Sometime in March my friend sent me Hail To The Thief, letting me know that it was a leaked, unmastered version.  Just listening to 2+2=5 I knew that this CD would be great.<br />After months of listening to the unmastered album, the CD was released.  I noticed the slight difference in some songs right away, and it just sounds alot better than the leaked version.  Radiohead has truly perfected their own style of music.  It takes the best parts from all their albums and is put together to form one incredible album.  I'm not going to rate every song on the album, because that is for you to decide.  This CD is perfect for any Radiohead fan, no matter which CD they prefer.  From start to finish, this is one beautiful album.
0894803123|3.0|This book is great if you're interested in the history and hijinks of the eponymous Ben & Jerry, or if you absolutely must have the specific recipe for one of their trademark flavors.    However, as a general purpose manual to making ice cream, it leaves a lot to be desired. More than half of the included recipes can be summed up as \\"Start with our sweet cream base, turn according to manufacturer's instructions, add chunks of [nut/candy/dough] two minutes before it finishes.\\" Sure, it's what has worked for them, but it's rather limited in scope and they could have gotten the message across in far fewer pages.    It's a short, easy read and it's not exactly a waste of money, but for a more thorough education in iced desserts, plan on picking up another book.
B00005JLZ9|1.0|I didn't even know John Travolta was in this when I entered the theater; if I had I might not have bothered. John Travolta and military \\"justice\\" is a combination I'd had my fill of. But once there I decided to hang in for what it was worth. While it did for a while show promise as a taut thriller for a while, ultimately it sunk below my lowest expectations. If you think it is because I'd had my fill of John Travolta though, he can't really be blamed for this muddled script that nobody could have saved. The trendy matter of twist endings never got so excessive before as it does here. I lost track of how many times one premise, and another, and still another that we'd bought into as the movie's foundation was utterly undermined by a new twist. What did the film start out being about? That faded into the mirky ancient past. I never thought I could be made to miss HIGH CRIMES and Ashley Judd's performance therein. But I did. At least with her you know you have a strong character who will be PORTRAYED as the movie's moral backbone, however many times the rug pulled out from under viewers at to which other supposed heroes we'd bought into!
B00003CXAE|5.0|Most people would think that you could'nt write a good movie about rock&roll. This movie sure proves them wrong. The songs are great, and the movie is great. <BR>       I said that the songs were a great part of the movie. Here they are. <BR>1. Grease-5/0 <BR>2. Summer Nights-8/10 <BR>3. Hopelessly Devoted To You-3/10 <BR>4. You're The One That I Want- 10/10 <BR>5. Sandy-1/10 <BR>6. Beauty School Dropout-5/10 <BR>7. Look At Me, I'm Sandra D.-7/10 <BR>8. Greased Lightning-9/10 <BR>9.

Love Is A Many Splendored Thing-4/10 <BR>24 Grease(Reprise)-5/10 <br />      As you can see, there are some VERY bad songs, but for the most part, the songs are pretty good. The whole movie was even better than the songs. The whole idea of the movie is a senior high schooler comes to the U.S. and goes to a cheap high school. There, she runs into a guy she met in the summer, who is in a car gang that is against another car gang. Throughout the year, this girl ( her name is Sandy) and her friends deal with the guy(his name is Danny) and his friends. The movie pretty much told about the \\"typical\\" high scholl senior's problems, except in a more 60's background. The movie actually took place in the 70's. At the end, Danny's car gang beats the rival gang in a car race, and at the end of the movie, the whole gang of guys and girls gets back together without any problems at the end of the year. The movie is all in all VERY good. Buy it today.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I'm not one to get carried away by a television show.  I teach English literature so I usually advocate reading over watching tv.  I began watching \\"Smallville\\" one night while working on the computer and soon found myself mesmerized by the storyline and the characterization of Clark, Lana, and Lex as well as by the fine acting by the three young actors who portray them.  I am entranced and moved by the yearning and very touching romantic relationship between Clark and the radiantly lovely Lana -- their chemistry is almost palpable onscreen and the actors (Tom Welling and Kristin Kreuk) who play them are so undeniably beautiful that it is difficult to tear one's eyes away from the screen when they are together in a scene.  Equally intriguing is the relationship between Clark and a very well-portrayed Lex Luthor -- there is a sense of true friendship and camaraderie while at the same time, an undercurrent of dread and uneasiness when watching them together.  This is one show I never miss during the regular season and which I have even discussed with enthusiastic students who are huge fans.  The powers-that-be at the studio need to release DVDs of the two seasons that have aired so far.  I'm sure there would be quite a market for them, including myself.  I hope this will be sooner rather than later!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I usually buy CDs, there are only a few songs that i like enough to listen to and it feels like ive wasted money..All the songs on this t.a.t.u. cd are great and worth listening to over and over again. They are my favorite music group and their talent is evident on this entire album. This is a great cd for teens as well as anyone into the rock/pop scene. If you like groups who push the envelope, t.a.t.u. is the group for you!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Hail to the theif is no Kid A or OK Computer but it is still very good. 2+2=5 starts the album off in great fashion.It starts of kind of mellow and then goes into a great heavier part. Quite a few songs are like this, i love that. Thom Yorke's political point of view is very interesting in this cd wiht all of the 1984 tyrannical type songs. The whole cd is a great listen. If you liked Kid A and Amnesiac you'll love this cd. Its a must have for all Radiohead fans.
B000000H6D|5.0|I hate to rank albums from a band each album has its own unique feel and meaning. But, in this case I would rank this as the best Type O album.  If you don't own it you should. This album questions everything from race to religion to love and to politics.  The best song and most underrated is We Hate Everyone.  This masterpiece is a witty poke at all those finger pointers on the hill the \\"Left Wing Nazis and Right Wing Commies\\" that like to label people and bands and put them into simple categories.  Type O tells them what they think about them nothing.  Of course to understand kill all the white people you have to understand the controversy surrounding the band when the album was released but it is still a timeless song with or with out this knowledge.  Type O Negative None More Negative.
0440211727|2.0|This is the second John Grisham book that I have read and found it very boring and very slow moving. During the first one hundred pages things are actually happening, but after that this book got very old, very fast.<br />A young black girl gets raped by two white boys who are drunk and high. They get arrested after trying to kill the girl, and then the dad comes along and kills them both. Throughout the next four hundred pages it is all about the trials and tribulations of the black man and his lawyer.<br />I would not recommend this book to someone who has previously read or this is their first John Grisham book. It is slow and looses you after page one hundred.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Less of an album-album than Kid A (in my opinion their best album - up until this gem!); as such, the songs are more consistently good - rather than being just an integral part of the tapestry.<br />Hail to the Thief is less alienating that either Kid A or Amnesiac because its outcry against oppression this time has a distinct focus, namely, the state of the world as evidenced by Dubya's election `theft'. I think this is at the core of why Hail to the Thief works so well.<br />Their last three studio albums (OK Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac) have opened with an electronic tune (Airbag, Everything..., and Sardines..., respectively). The fact that Hail to the Thief does not - \\"2+2=5\\" is an organic, punk-rock number - hails new areas of musical exploration for the band.<br />The dynamics of the album are fascinating - the sounds are intense. It's not until \\"We suck Young Blood\\" that the opening aural onslaught subsides. That track, only barely interesting enough for my mind, is nevertheless a great foray into some kind of goth-jazz sound and a display of Thom Yorke's distinctly refined whining (beautiful though it is).<br />It's easy to call them this generation's Pink Floyd when on some tracks (notably, \\"Where I End and You Begin\\") they even sound like them - as others have said before.<br />Hail to the Thief is as inventive as Kid A, and somehow as accessible as OK Computer. It does not excel in any new direction, but it is a solid work that will certainly broaden the credibility of Radiohead as a bunch of geniuses.<br />Standouts: \\"Sit down. Stand up.\\" (for intensity); \\"A Punchup at a Wedding\\" (for proof that even Radiohead can do `funk') + many other songs.
B00008PC2O|1.0|Being a huge Terminator fan, I was disappointed to buy this DVD and find out that many of the features such as the two other versions of the film (theatrical and special extended version) are only available on DVD ROM.  If you are playing this DVD in your \\"home\\" DVD player like I am, all you get is one version of the film - the \\"Special Edition\\" which includes 16 added minutes.  Some of those added 16 minutes are good, but some of it (Sarah's dream sequences with Kyle) were rightly cut in the first place.  I definitely think the theatrical version should be available for play on a \\"regular\\" DVD player, such as with the \\"Independence Day\\" DVD.  If you are playing this T2 Extreme DVD on your home DVD player (no DVD ROM), all you get are two documentaries, one version of the film, filmmaker commentary, and an interactive mode (and the regulars: subtitles, etc.)  All of those extras are fine, but nothing more than recent DVDs I have purchased and not really worth all the hype.  I suppose most people watch their DVDs on their PCs, but for those of us who don't, this DVD might be a disappointment.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I would just like to say that since the release of this DVD, I haven't been able to watch anything else. It is by far the best DVD Led Zeppelin has released. With songs such as &quot;Bring It On Home&quot; and &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; and the rare press footageit is a classic. It is an ideal piece of history that any Led Zeppelin fan should have.
076790592X|3.0|I'm the odd duck who didn't LOVE this book. Yeah, yeah, it was sad and sweet and touching and all that. But it's a cliche to have an old man on his deathbed imparting hard-earned wisdom to a brash young comer. I probably would have liked Morrie, actually, but I think I'd have emphasized a different side of him, if I'd been writing about him. This reads too much like the ubiquitous Chicken Soup series. Too much of a good thing, even truly good things, is still too much. I'm over it.
B000089RVX|5.0|I could not believe how good this CD was when i first listened to it. I couldn't STOP listening to it, and when i lost my CD, i almost bursted into tears (but i found it under the couch). I advise you buy the CD without second thoughts. It's amazing, especially if you like (kinda) gothic rock with a voice that seduces you into listening to it over and over again!
1400034779|4.0|It ain't great literature, but nobody promised it was, and besides, it's a great beach read, and you learn quite a bit about Botswana in the bargain.<BR>Premise is that a woman sets up a one-lady detective agency, not only the #1 agency of its kind, but the ONLY agency of its kind. Written as a series of vignettes focusing on the cases that come along, the author explores and enlightens her readers at a leisurely pace, which is just perfect for sitting on the warm sand and glancing up every now and then to check on the children playing at water's edge. <BR>Written with wit and wisdom, this is a book to be read, savored, and then passed on to a friend.

0679745203|5.0|Don't miss this - and don't miss the movie, either.<BR>The English Patient is a completely enthralling novel of war, honor, romance, and courage. The parts written in the point of view of the English patient while under the effects of morphine are especially difficult, but just as especially lyrical, dense, and captivating.<BR>Wow.
0440237688|3.0|The Giver is an okay book, it wasn't something that I would read again, it was kind of like a one-time read.  It had good parts but I liked some of Louis Lowry's other books better, the ending isn't great but if you have an \\"open mind\\" it should make sense.  It's a good book except the reading level was a little low and the ending wasnt very good, but besides that it was okay.
0385504209|4.0|I just finished reading this novel and I enjoyed it from beginning to end.  I could not put this book down.  I thought it was very provocative and insightful.  I am also a Christian, but I am sufficiently secure in my beliefs to understand this is a work of fiction, and it should be taken as so.  If you are not mature enough to read a book that might challenge your belief system,  or give you an alternate perspective to spirituality, stay away from this genre.  This is a mystery novel wrapped around a very interesting historical subject.  I have recommended this book to many people and they all have loved it.<br />Happy reading!
B00008LDPU|5.0|This is for Anime fans and Matrix fans alike. Well thought out stories and simply stunning animation are combined to create one amazing DVD. If the next all CGI movie is as good as &quot;The Last Flight of the Osiris&quot;, then I cannot wait to see it. The other short films are all as good or better than the Osiris story. <br />This is what I would call &quot;Essential&quot; viewing.
6305537321|5.0|It's hard to summarize this movie.  Audrey Hepburn plays Holly, a character running as fast as she can from her humble roots.  She is totally enchanting and I can't imagine any one else being able to pull this off...  With other actresses I can see the portryal of Holly coming off harsh and trashy.  I understand that originally Marilyn Monroe was to play Holly.  I cant see this being the same movie if she had.<br />Miss Hepburn plays it with such innocent wit and vulnerability it is totally on the mark.  Initially, her life looks like a constant party...  No feelings go beyond the surface.  All people are just props...  But as the film progresses you see the the feelings beyond the surface.  They seem to emerge after she meets the george peppard character...  someone with dark issues of his own. A *kept* writer with a married woman paying the bills.<br />The relationship between peppard and hepburn reminds me a bit of two siblings clutching eachother for safety while an unsafe world spins around them.  For me, george peppard was a bit flat.  I am not sure if it is the character or the portrayal...or just comparing him to Ms hepburns preformance.<br />Buddy Ebsen's part in the film always confused me.  I suppose he is there to show where holly came from, why she is running, etc.  But I never found that part of the movie to fit in for me.  It seemed to come out of left field.<br />If you havent ever seen this, you need to see it at least once.  If only for the *style* of the movie and the great characters in it...<br />The movie, much like Hollys life is a grand escape.
B000002LND|3.0|At first glance, my 3 Star rating may seem a bit harsh, but I'll explain my thinking instead of just saying simply &quot;The remixes are bad&quot; or &quot;It's missing songs&quot;. <br />Right off the bat, I deduct one star for the well-known hits that aren't present, and another for the severely altered tracks that were included, which is much to the dismay of a purist a la moi. (More on these points later on). <br />Needless to say, what's here is outstanding, the ideal opener is &quot;Lucky Star&quot;. A steady bass line fuels &quot;Borderline&quot;. &quot;Material Girl&quot; was one of the decades top anthems and is still Mrs. Ciccone/Penn/Richie's nickname some 20 odd years later. As the decade wore on Madonna's music took on more socially conscious fare, as evidenced on &quot;Papa don't preach&quot; which dealt with pregnancy, backed up by a winding bass line and orchestra arrangement. <br />&quot;Like a prayer&quot; boasts a soaring chorus, and you may know a thing or two about the video, which was controversial (depicting crosses burning and a smooch session between her and a priest) and got her dropped from a Pepsi ad campaign. The piano driven &quot;Vogue&quot; is also stellar. <br />However, as I said earlier there's a few tremendous drawbacks. A few tracks fade out far too early, while others are nearly ruined by tacky dance sections which were added on. <br />In addition there Is the glaring absence of many well-known hits (some reaching the Top 10): &quot;Burning up&quot;, &quot;Dress you up in my love&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, Who's that Girl&quot;, &quot;True Blue&quot; and &quot;Causing a commotion&quot;. The fact these songs were overlooked is unforgivable. <br />New track &quot;Justify my Love&quot; is decent but not great. <BR>Heck, I find it difficult to justify it's presence given the missing hits (pardon the pun.) Penned by Lenny Kravitz, the lyrics are sleazy, and the music has a light and moody feel. In hindsight it foreshadowed the careerpath Madonna would soon take. Anyone else remember on Saturday Night Live's &quot;Wayne's World&quot; sketch, they did a HILARIOUS parody of &quot;Justify my love's&quot; video? <br />For Casual fans wanting an adequate snapshot of Mach 1 of Madonna's career, &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; fits the bill very well and lives up to it's promise. Fans who want a more thorough, complete picture obviously would be better serviced by the actual albums. Anyone stuck in between these two categories should weigh the factors I mentioned before splurging.
0312305060|1.0|Does anyone remember what Ayn Rand said in the Fountain Head?  In her book there is a character that writes a poorly written, no plotted, ridiculous book.  Some how it is published, and all of NYC and beyond go wild for it in social settings.  However, no one actually believes it to be a good book, they are all just too afraid that they'll show some weakness or defect within themselves if they admit to its lack of anything stimulating.  <br />This is the only reasonable explanation for Michael Cunningham's The Hours.  I can not fathom why anyone would think this to be a good book, unless of course they are just caught up in the hype and too afraid to untangle themselves. <br />I feared that this book I had purchased would be passed down and fall into the wrong hands causing someone to spiral down into a pit of despair.  So immediately upon finishing it, I closed the cover, took a deep breath, walked over to the woodstove and threw it in.  Something I'd never done before or since.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|I purchased the 2003 Re-issued version of this album on Cassette. I was so glad to see they were still making 'em!

Side 2 starts with &quot;TNT&quot; whose opening chords you may be familiar with. This song is still a live pillar today, and with good reason, as it's qualities are anthemic. <br />On &quot;Can I sit next to you Girl&quot; the guitars briskly wind, followed by &quot;Little Lover&quot; which is bluesy to the core. If your head doesn't nod to the enormous groove of this track, I really coundn't help you. To top it all off, Bon's lyrics are Genius: <br />&quot;Little lover, I can't get you off my mind <BR>Little Lover, I've been trying hard to find <BR>someone to give me the things that I need, ow! <br />You had my picture <BR>On your bedroom wall <BR>Next to Gary Glitter, yeah <BR>I was standing on the stage <BR>Playing rock 'n' roll <BR>I was a guitar picker, yeah <BR>Never had a record <BR>Never had a hit <BR>Oh baby <BR>You didn't mind a bit&quot; <br />&quot;She's got balls&quot; has sleazy lyrics, backed by a distorted crunch. The closing title track rocks out splendidly.<br />&quot;High Voltage&quot; is an undeniable classic, for newcomers I'd recommend this as your first Bon Scott-Era album.
B000093BDX|4.0|Much like The Beatles' 1, you cannot quibble about the contents- all the songs presented here were top forty hits. However...this could have been truly definitive by including the two top forty entries that are not here- &quot;The Little Girl I Once Knew&quot; and &quot;It's OK&quot; (Yes, I'm aware &quot;Caroline, No&quot; also fits the bill, but technically speaking, that single was credited to Brian Wilson and not The Beach Boys). All thirty-two tracks could have been fitted onto one disc, as long as you include the mono single versions and not the stereo mixes of certain songs, which have been used here. Yes, this is the best single disc compilation out there, but my advice is to wait for the proposed double disc set &quot;40 Top 40s&quot; (including international chart hits), which will hopefully paint the complete picture.

This song is still a live pillar today, and with good reason, as it's qualities are anthemic. <br />On &quot;Can I sit next to you Girl&quot; the guitars briskly wind, followed by &quot;Little Lover&quot; which is bluesy to the core. If your head doesn't nod to the enormous groove of this track, I really coundn't help you. To top it all off, Bon's lyrics are Genius: <br />&quot;Little lover, I can't get you off my mind <BR>Little Lover, I've been trying hard to find <BR>someone to give me the things that I need, ow! <br />You had my picture <BR>On your bedroom wall <BR>Next to Gary Glitter, yeah <BR>I was standing on the stage <BR>Playing rock 'n' roll <BR>I was a guitar picker, yeah <BR>Never had a record <BR>Never had a hit <BR>Oh baby <BR>You didn't mind a bit&quot; <br />&quot;She's got balls&quot; has sleazy lyrics, backed by a distorted crunch. The closing title track rocks out splendidly.
B000084T18|5.0|This is the best album I have heard since 2pac came out. He's the major hardcore rapper out there right now. Buy this album! It's worth the money!
B000092ZYY|5.0|As with many of their other albums, 'Hail to the thief' is a musical work of art. A MUST if u already have 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac'. If you don't have them, this album is a good place to start but be sure to buy them too (you will be compelled to anyhow). Fans of the band's early work (OK Comp and Bends era) will not be disappointed (how could we be), this band has delivered time and time again.<br />The album is multi-layered, in sound and in philosophy, and it took me 3 full listens to actually like the album (not uncommon, even for the hardcore fans. got to get our pre-album expectations out of our system u know). But after a few good runs, the album takes on new meaning and easily rates as one of my favourite albums of all time. <br />Hey, but don't just take it from me, they'll be winning some Grammys for this, I'm quite certain.
B00008K7AM|2.0|As I sit here about to write a review for this latest adventure that pits Rob Schneider into some kind of comedic lunacy, I have to wonder what kind of cartoonish situation Hollywood will put him in next. He's already been a gigolo, an animal, and now he's a teenage girl. What's next?. Rob Schneider as Martha Stewart?!. I think I would actually watch that. This film, like every other Schneider movie, is a film to watch and best be enjoyed if you turn your brain completely off. Like \\"Deuce Bigalow\\" and \\"The Animal\\" before it, the movie's premise is somewhat funny when you think of Schneider doing it. It always starts off rather fun and laughable, and kind of entertaining. But, as usual, the movie wears out it's premise too thin by the middle or so, and it reaches the conclusion wheezing and gagging. Barely making it to the end with the comedic touch it had in the beginning. This is the way it is with all his movies, and this one is definitley no exception. The movie has a popular, pretty, sexy teenaged girl named Jessica(Rachel McAdams), who is the queen of the school. You know the type. She has her clique of other popular, pretty girls along with her. After Jessica gets some ancient, magical earrings at a store at the mall, she changes bodies with a low life crook named Clive(Schneider), after a run in with him at a gas station. She has one earring, and he got the other. They both wake up the next morning in each other's bodies. This does set up some funny situations, but it also stirs up some predictable ones you can see a mile away. Jessica, in Clive's body, gets the help of her closest friend(played by Anna Faris, who appeared in both \\"Scary Movie\\" pics), in hopes of finding out what happened and get back into her own body. Along the way, Faris begins to fall for Schneider, even though it's really her friend Jessica. Like we didn't see that coming. Being trapped in the man's body opens Jessica up to the things around her. Her friends, her boyfriend(Matthew Lawrence), love, and the troubled relationship of her parents. By the way, her mom is hot!. It's the usual lesson we have seen a million times when a rude, selfish person sees what they were so oblivious too. As I had said before, the movie's premise is quite fun at the start, but it soon becomes rather repetitive the longer it goes on. The things that made you laugh earlier are now gone, and in it's place are limp jokes and sight gags that seem rather desperate to make you laugh, or to even smile. When it finally ends, it ends sufferably, and you just want to put it out of it's misery. The cast, tho, all seem game and seem to be having a fun time making the movie. Wouldn't you?. Schneider has always come across as a likeable guy, and can be rather funny when given the right material. Sadly, he hasn't been given the right material vey much. Anna Faris is a real sweetheart. I can't exactly put my finger on it, but she has a real sweet charm and quality to her. She is adorable with an extremely lovely and loveable presence. She was the only one that gave the 'Scary Movie' films some kind of solid credibility. Plus, she looks great as a blonde. Michael 'O' Keefe(\\"Caddyshack\\" and \\"Roseanne\\"), plays Jessica's father, and Adam Sandler, one of the film's producers, pops up in a rather unfunny and annoying cameo. This movie is innocent fun. There is nothing here that says that this is a movie that is anything but stupid fun. Stupid?. Yes. Fun?. At times. These movies are harmless, and they will always have a place in the theaters. I, and most others, still have that part of ourselves that will see these movies and still have a couple of chuckles come out. I hope we never lose those parts of ourself. It would be quite boring. However, it would be so much better if the movies themselves, like this one, put a little more effort into it.
B00005YU1O|2.0|The 'story' is non-existent, only following one guy around as he goes from place to place wandering aimlessly.  I do not exaggerate.  What follows is nothing more than over-intellectualized psycho-babble about the meaning of life.  Heavy on the babble.  Heavy on the psycho.  Only 2-3 snippets, as far as I remember, featured \\"the common man\\"'s plight...  The conversations didn't even spark my interest in the subject matter because it all sounded so pretensious.  A perfectly intolerable film.  Avoid this one.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This 3 CD collection is an explosion of stereophonic bliss. Until now, the mainstay of acquaintance with Led Zeppelin's live performance abilities was 1976's `The Song Remains The Same' live album and film. Although amazing musically, this album left much to be desired with regards to the overall quality of the recording. Hard core fans kept yearning for more, fruitlessly praying for more live Zeppelin. That day is now. `How The West Was Won' is superior to `The Song Remains the Same' in every conceivable way. The quality of the recording sounds as if it was recorded in a studio. Musically, this album is beyond words. The many layers of musical ecstasy envelope the listener for hours of endless satisfaction. This IS what \\"live\\" should be. From the solid drumming, thumbing bass, searing guitar, to the dynamic vocals, this album is a veritable compendium of live rock. This album is a \\"must have\\" for any music lover. For all your Zeppelin needs, I also recommend the new DVD, and of course the 'Complete Studio Recordings' box set. This 3-disc set is definitely a masterpiece, and a hell of a lot of fun. Rock On!
B00006CXSS|5.0|After witnessing Saving Private Ryan, I never thought war film could get better. While this isn't a film, it still deserves to be the greatest war motion picture ever. The main reason I believe this is better is simply, the length. With 2 and a half hours, as in SPR, you really only get the look and a small hint of the soldiers lives. 10 episodes covers so much more about the characters personality and lives. Where they have been, what they will do after the war and how it effects them each psychologically. After watching it on TV, I felt so sad that it was over yet glad that the surviours were going home to thier loved ones. The instant that I heard it was going to be released on DVD, I reserved a copy. This series draws you in so much you get to know the characters, what they are like and how they reacted to war. It's an unparalleled look at what young boys had to go through to save us from the evil that was Hitler.<BR>As you would have noticed, I keep referring to Saving Private Ryan. The reason being that it looks similar to Band Of Brothers. As we think of most great War films early in cinema history like The Longest Day, they are in black and white. We associate war films with black and white because the films of that era were. So in post production they did colour diluting which gives the feel of black n white in colour. It's a very effective way of manipulating your mind into thinking you're there. As far as the DVD itself is concerned, it's packaged beautifully and the extras are awsome. Hours and hours of behind the scene stuff which is what I love. It also contains a 1 and a half hour interview with the soldiers themselves. It's a moving experience to listen first hand, to the unbelievable stories told with such emotion.<BR>Anyone who is a history buff or just into war movies, needs this in thier collection. A true masterpiece. Many people ask me why I take great joy in films about so much suffering. It took me a while to answer that question myself. ButI now realise that our way of honoring the great veterens and the poor souls who perished, is to understand what they had to go through. They did it so we don't have to. Band Of Brothers is a truly great achievement and will be remembered as the great war story of our lives.
6305127646|5.0|The chemistry between Elisabeth Shue and Val Kilmer was great! <BR>Great entertaiment and a fabulous soundtrack, my fav is the Duran Duran song. <BR>Buy the movie and the soundtrack!
B000002MP2|5.0|well i didn't buy it when it came out but this one of the first rock cds i bought which was a very long time ago almost 10 years.  these guys are still rockin' with american idiot although not my favorite green day cd but it still is very good.  punk/pop is not my favorite type of music to listen to but green day are exceptional.  everyone has to own this cd by now.  if this is the only one u own by green day i would recommend insomniac, and nimrod.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This movie never gets enough credit! This is one of the best war time movies ever and with Mr. Peck's passing this is a must see for Peck fans who have not seen this movie. Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer in one of his best roles play a cat and mouse game during WW2. The acting is fantastic and there is a lot of suspense! A must see!
B00004Z459|5.0|I have to admit I use to HATE all the NEW metal bands...Such as Linkin Park, Kid Rock, Slipknot, &amp; Mudvayne.  As time grew on, I heard a couple of LPs songs on the radio and for some reason they started to grow on to me.  The thing that stood out the most on this CD that all the songs didn't sound the same like some bands out there like CREED.  They each had a different style and all of em wasn't rock or rap.  The only reason I like there new CD is because it's less rap and more ROCK which is underrated these days.  I think Linkin Park is starting to end up like Pearl Jam because I don't think LP will ever be able to top Hybrid Theory.  Thats my opinion anyway, you may hate them and you may wish they would never exist but take a chance like me and discover what they are really all about.
0393057658|5.0|For any baseball fan, this is required reading.  The novel follows the Oakland A's front office as they try to change the way baseball is played.  Author Lewis' main point is that the way that the history of baseball has been recorded is flawed, that the stats every fan has read for their whole lives do not paint an accurate picture of the game. Lewis spends the first few chapters setting the stage, how A's General Manager Billy Beane was a prototypical can't miss prospect who failed miserably, how statistician Bill James' gospel reached the masses.  The book really picks up steam when Lewis goes in depth of how Beane and his staff implement their vision, epecially in the chapeters on the 2002 draft and 2002 trade deadline.  <br />My main flaw is that Lewis tends to take a very pro-Beane perspective, rarely accounting where his decisions did not pan out.  For example, in the 2001 draft, Beane physically berated a scout for wanting to draft Jeremy Bonderman, a high school pitcher.  In 2003, Bonderman is playing in the Major Leages.  In the 2002 draft, Beane ridiculed the Mets for drafting hight school pitcher Scott Kazmir, who has torn through the Mets system and is rated as one of the top prospects in baseball.<br />For all his flaws, Beane has come up with a system that has allowed him to challenge the rules that allow rich teams to compete at the highest levels.
B00006M183|4.0|This may be there best work since Vitalogy.  After Vitalogy Pearl Jam has gone downhill.  Except for No Code I really liked that one but it is underrated.  Alot of the songs sound great on Live On Two Legs.  As for this CD I'm not sure, but I can assure you it is worth buying. The songs that I like on this album are &quot;Green Disease&quot;, &quot;Get Right&quot;, &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot;, &quot;I Am Mine&quot; &quot;Save You&quot;, &amp; &quot;Ghost&quot;.  Those songs stand out the most and the rest are pretty much forgettable or boring.  And don't buy this if your not open minded and are looking for another TEN because this is Vitalogy part 2 with the singles.  If you are looking for another TEN try Vs. cuz that is the closest your ever gonna get.
B00006G8G1|5.0|What can I say but,<br />this is a brilliant live concert DVD from one of the world's greatest bands!<br />The song lineup is fabulous,the sound & picture quality really good and the band rocks!<br />Unlike other reviewers I have seen here, I DID NOT have a problem with the film editing- it was fast, but not annoying and simply kept things going at a good steady pace.<br />I recommend this DVD to all lovers of real metal-<br />Up The Irons!!
B00006RU5B|4.0|What can I say about this album other than it kicks major ...!  One of the best albums of 2,002!  I've waited for this album for a long time & I can't say it is a disappointment. Although I am kind of sick of \\"Cochise\\" & \\"Like A Stone\\".  My favorite song off the cd is the most likely unknown song on the album called \\"Shadow of the Sun\\".  I also like the ballad \\"I Am The Highway\\" only on the account of its not getting that much radio play but I have heard it a couple of times including \\"Show Me How To Live\\".  Those are all great tracks as well but you can't forget about \\"Gasoline\\", \\"What You Are\\", \\"Set It Off\\", & the one I have already mentioned \\"Shadow of the Sun\\".  All I can say that this the first half of the CD is really good then it starts to go downhill.
B000002UA0|4.0|This album is the perfect balance between sheer lunacy and sheer genius. No one will ever successfully duplicate what Syd Barrett accomplished on this one-of-a-kind album, which in my opinion, set the Beatles and Sgt. Pepper in their place as being the most psychedelic album of our time.
B000071ZZI|5.0|All I can say it is a great movie...Although I haven't read the book or seen the last film I must say that this film kicks major [butt]!  I'm not a huge Matt Damon fan either but he was pretty good.  This movie is boring in the begginning but it is action-packed like you wouldn't believe.  I have to say that this is the best movie of 2002.  Although as of now it is tied with Die Another Day.  Which is another great action-packed type of movie.  As for the dvd goes it is filled with bonuses, extras, deleted scenes just like your typical dvd, which by the way isn't bad.  You may or may not be disappointed with this movie because I'm not familiar with the other book or movie my advice to you is just give this movie a shot, you may like it...
B000096I9G|5.0|Not only is this a great Cure concert film, this is one of the best concert films I have ever seen.  The band spared no expense on this release.  From the high definition video to the 5.1 digital sound, every last detail is magnificent.  If you are a huge fan of The Cure or merely somewhat interested in any of these albums it would be a crime not to own this DVD.
B00005QXXO|5.0|Truly an essential album - Radiohead takes song that might seem impossible to perfrom live and make them intense, warm, and energetic. <br />&quot;The National Anthem&quot; is one of the highpoints of the album. I like this version as much as the album version - instead of crazy jazz players we get frantic loops and samples. <br />&quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; is my favorite track on the album - we get beautiful, subdued piano version with understandable lyrics in Tom's best singing voice. <br />&quot;Idioteque&quot; has an intensity that only live performance can give - the double-tempo section is amazing.<br />&quot;I Might be Wrong&quot; and &quot;Morning Bell&quot; are quiet similar to the album versions - this EP is very well engineered, so much so that at times it sounds like a studio album.<br />&quot;Dollars and Cents&quot; is also similar to the album version, but has   a more concrete, less dreamy feel of a  live show.<br />&quot;True Love Waits&quot; is an older, acoustic guitar-based song. Lyrically beautiful, but in my opinion the weakest track on the album.
B00008OWZC|5.0|The Cranky Reviewer is either a schlock pop record company's dream, or he is putting us on. Duran Duran better than Led Zepplin? LeBon remembered long after Page? Excuse me?<BR>Then I read the rest of his reviews, and that explained everything. Cranky, do yourself and us a favor and lock yourself in a basement with all your Celine Dion records.<BR>Stick to reviewing stuff you like, because your reviews of bands that many, many, many other people like do no good for anyone.
B00005JLSE|5.0|As I write this review, and note that any format would be an awesome purchase in my opinion!, I think \\"did I see this as a play or a movie?\\". So well produced - Rob Marshall created a masterpiece of bringing theater to the big screen but with a twist of flashbacks through the eyes and mind of Renee's character, Roxie Hart. My congrats to their Academy Awards - totally deserved! I hear the songs in my head, see the characters singing them - Catherine Zeta Jones is fantastic and any doubt that Rene Zellweger or Richard Gere can pull off the characters and the vocals is dashed. And Queen Latifah! She, as Momma Morton, well, I can't say enough! Another 5 stars, just for her! Do I need to say I enjoyed this movie!? It is superb entertainment! I recommend it highly and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Since this is pre-DVD release review, I must wait for August 19th. I am anxious for this DVD to be in my collection! Enjoy the show!
B00005JM1F|5.0|I took my wife to see this by accident.  I hate Will Ferrall and I thought that the commercials looked stupid.  We thought that we were going to see \\"Bringing Down The House\\" however I screwed up and thought this was that film.  After initially being angry for my mistake, I laughed almost non stop for most of the film.  My wife is a bit stuffy and usually not interested in this type of raucus humor and even she was laughing uncontrollably.  Vince Vaughn (Ear Muffs!) was fantastic and I became an instant Will Ferrall fan after his streaking scene.  This movie was foolish and very funny for a former frat boy who at the age of 40 remembered many of the dumb things college kids do with very fond memories.  See this movie.
B00003CX97|5.0|This is a great movie about a great story.  It was a big budget movie featuring awesome scenery and cinamatography. As if that were not enough, the film is embellished with bravo performances by William Holden, Alec Guiness, Jack Hawkins, Sessue Hayakawa and others.  No wonder &quot;Kwai&quot; won no fewer than seven academy awards in 1957 including Best Picture.<br />The story is brutally simple.  British (and one or two American) POWs in Southeast Asia are being forced to work in railway gangs for the Japanese.  The struggle between the British POWs and the Japanese makes for a great story, as the British Senior POW and the Japanese commander engage in a battle of wills.  The outcome of the film packs a wallop, and I found it to be very satisfying.  This movie never drags, and is punctuated with humor although the overall tone is deadly serious.<br />One nice thing about this film is that although it does not in any way glorify war or whitewash the awful consequences of war, it also avoids gratuitous violence, and is suitable for fairly young viewers to watch.<br />This is quite possibly the greatest war movie ever made.  What more can one say?
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is the live Zeppelin recording that we all knew was hiding on tape somewhere.  We knew it had to come out someday.  It also has benefited from from a thorough modern cleansing.  You can hear everything and there's great dynamic range.  This is the band at their peak.  They're still young, but they have the chops to do what they want.  I originally wasn't going to buy it because the past live releases from this band have been less than great.  I like the BBC sessions, but they're shortened/sanitized for radio.  &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; is bad.  This is the real thing.  I was 18 when this was done, I sure wish I had been there.  This will probably be considered the standard for Zeppelin live recordings. . . .now I can retire all the old bootleg l.p.'s.
B00006RINF|5.0|The singer of my band put this in his truck and played track 7, a song called &quot;Tight Rope.&quot;  About 30 seconds into the song, I already knew I'd like this band because it remined me a little of Paradise Lost (who are among my favorite bands of all time... but that's another review...).  A few seconds later, the chorus begins -- a sweeping, epic, melodic and angelic voice from Cristina.  I swear the hair on my arm stood up.  The next day I bought this disc, mercilessly repeated it in my various dics players, and still haven't come close to becoming tired of it.  A few weeks ago, I saw them live and they won over everyone in the room.  I think that anyone who gives this disc a listen will quickly consider Lacuna Coil among the greatest in the world.  Don't believe me?  Buy this disc and go to track 7 ...
B00005JMK6|4.0|I saw \\"The Spanish Apartment\\" (L'Auberge Espagnole) while I was in Madrid in the fall of 2002.  I loved it, especially because it is the story of what I was going through.  Xavier studies in BARCELONA, not Madrid.  Barcelona is a beautiful city full of historic buildings and near the ocean where Madrid is land-locked, still beautiful, but very different.  Xavier leaves behind his family and girlfriend in France, and after a long search for an apartment in Spain, he lives with with a group of other students from various places.  The film is called \\"La casa de los locos\\" in Spanish (translated House of the crazy people).  <br />I really like that this film is in different languages.  The characters mostly use Spanish, English, and French.  It is interesting to watch them all switch back and forth between languages.  I also loved the great shots of Barcelona, but my favorite part is the climax, so you really have to watch this film to the end.  I won't give anything away, but it's just nice to see how all of the members of the house come together.  I would not say they will be friends for life, but Xavier definitely took some great memories and a better understanding of himself home with him (just like I did).
B000092ZYX|5.0|after hearing about half the songs from *ahem* bootleg mp3s, i expected this album to be good but it really exceeded my expectations when i finally bought it a few days after it came out. Its a really great listen all the way through and while it does borrow a lot from OK computer and Amnesiac, the overall mood of this album is a lot different than any radiohead album before it. it is much darker than ok computer even and seems to focus on corruption and the hopeless state that the members of the band perceive the world to be in. the whole album sounds like a journey through a dark forest with gnarled trees, which is an idea illustrated in previous liner notes art and their video for \\"there there\\", but finally they give this idea a musical score. heres a breakdown of all the songs:<br />\\"2+2=5\\" is a great song to start this album out with. The spooky harmony and dark guitar parts really set the tone for the rest of the album, and about a minute and a half through the song they just throw down and rock the place<br />\\"sit down, stand up\\" is a song that really surprised me the first time i heard it because its something that radiohead has really never done before but sounds like something theyve been meaning to do for a while. this song finally blows up in a crazy techno beat at the end.<br />\\"sail to the moon\\" is GREAT. imagine that the best parts of paranoid subterranian android and pyramid song were somehow spliced into one great song. if that gets you excited, check this album out.<br />\\"backdrifts\\" sounds a lot like something off of amnesiac, sort of a disjointed sounded electronic sound with pretty oscillating synths in the background and a funky beat.<br />\\"Go to sleep\\" is an important song because it is a sudden change to something very upbeat and guitar driven. not one of the best songs though, and not anything terribly original.<br />\\"Where I end and You Begin\\": I think this may become one of my favorite songs on this album after a while. Everytime i hear this song i get kind of excited and turn the volume up. It has haunting effects and is a sad song but a great rock song at the same time<br />\\"We Suck Young Blood\\" Ooh, man this is what this album is all about i think. VERY dark and moving, but the best part is when they go nuts about 3 minutes in.<br />\\"The Gloaming\\" shows you once again where theyre progressing to from amnesiac. Very dark again, but has a similar electronic beat to songs in amnesiac and best of all, a crazy bass that will blow out your woofers.<br />\\"There There\\" is my favorite song on this album right now, and i think its a great choice for a single even though the radio edit isnt nearly as powerful as the one on the album. Starts out with a beat that sounds familiar somehow but is totally original, and just keeps moving and pulling you in until it reaches an awesome climax you can feel coming from the get go<br />\\"I will\\" sounded REALLY familiar, like something off of amnesiac or maybe OK computer somehow. maybe thats just evidence that its a great song because it sounds so natural<br />\\"A Punchup at a wedding\\" is a really complex arrangement of pianos and singing with a groovy bass and a nice beat. Im kind of disappointed it doesnt change up more but its still a good song<br />Hearing \\"Myxamatosis\\" reminded me of the first time I heard Idioteque for the first time. I was a little bit confused but i could tell I had just witnessed something of real genius and i just couldnt quite appreciate it completely. So i was intrigued and listened to it more and sure enough, its awesome. I really like the breaks<br />\\"Scatterbrain\\" is just a good solid, beautiful haunting song that calms things down a bit after myxamatosis and reestablishes the more common theme in this album<br />Ive noticed that the last songs on radiohead albums are almost always really strange and/or surprising. Sometimes they can be the best songs on the whole album by far like on pablo honey, sometimes they just make the whole album more confusing like the jazzy glass house song at the end of amnesiac. I couldn't imagine a better ending to this album than \\"a wolf at the door\\" though, because its like a few rays of hope finally come through and you think for a second, despite the still haunting feeling you get, that maybe the storm is over.
0515123447|1.0|Simply awful.  When I finally finished this \\"book\\", I was suprised to see a picture of the author at the end.  I was expecting a 7 or 8 year old.  The writing is that bad.  He uses short sentences to explain everything.  It is very distracting and takes you out of the story.  You are suppose to lose yourself in a story, not keep being distracted by bad writing. <br /> It says that Lee Child used to be a TV writer.  Well, you would think that he would be good at writing dialogue.  He's not.  Every character talks the same.  If someone is asked a question, they shrug and then speak in short sentences.  Everyone shrugs all the time.  It's almost funny how much the word is used.  <br />As for the plot, I guessed the secret very early.  Mainly because it was already used in Robert Crais' \\"Indigo Slam.\\"  The handling of the end of the relationship between Reacher and Roscoe was poorly handled and should have been given more attention since it was a major part of the book.  <br />All in all, Reacher does have potential as a character, but he needs a better writer to handle him.  If want to read great writing, read Robert Crais.
037542217X|4.0|The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency has problems--a new competitor run by a man has opened in town. And with Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni returning from his long bout with depression, there's the problem of how to pay Mma. Makutsi--who has served as assistant detective and also acting manager of Matekoni's garage. Still, although the competitor threatens to steal some of their business, Mma. Ramotswe has some detecting jobs to do--including finding the people a client wronged many years before and whether a husband is cheating on his wife. In the meantime, Mma. Makutsi comes up with a brilliant idea--a typing school for men--men who wouldn't be caught dead in a secretarial college like Mma. Makutsi attended, but who need keyboard skills for their jobs. It's an ideal solution to her money problems and also a convenient way for the single Makutsi to discover a man.<br />Author Alexander McCall Smith loves Africa, its traditional ways of life, and the ways that its people (at least the people of Botswana) treat one another. His No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series, including THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN are practically poetic in their praises of this traditional way of life. Mma. Ramotswe is the protagonist in these stories and the central pillar for tradition. Her detecting and the solutions to her clients problems flow from these African traditions (as interpreted by Smith) and prove heart-warming even in the midst of poverty and the AIDS crisis that has destroyed so much of Africa (AIDS is not mentioned by name in this novel but its impact is clear to see). Whether Smith's view of Africa has anything to do with the real continent is something I won't even attempt to decide, but it is certainly his view and his love for this Africa is obvious and compelling.<br />Smith's beautiful writing makes KALAHARI an enjoyable read that can be savored or swallowed in a gulp. The characters of Mma. Makutsi and Mma. Ramotswe are well drawn and interesting. KALAHARI is anything but a thriller, but it makes a wonderful diversion from the everyday.t a thriller, but it makes a wonderful diversion from the everyday.

B00005QY5Y|4.0|Ryan Adams found a lot of success on his debut album HEARTBREAKER. He came back a year later with his second solo album GOLD. GOLD is a lot more mainstream than HEARTBREAKER is. GOLD finds Adams pushing the creative buttons again and trying new things. This album is a little less country and a lot more rock. 16 tracks which clocks in at over 70 minutes, it's a lot to digest, but patient and willing listeners will be best advised to do so, because there's truly some brilliant moments on GOLD. While it's definately not as captivating as HEARTBREAKER is, he's also not trying to make a record like that. GOLD is completely different. The album seems to draw from artists like Van Morrison, The Rolling Stones, and Neil Young, to name a few.<br />The album opens with the spectacular &quot;New York New York&quot;, the albums first single. Mistaken as a post-9-11 song, the song is actually about a breakup, but served as a healer for many people (even indirectly). &quot;Somehow, Someday&quot; and &quot;When The Stars Go Blue&quot; stand as some of the best from this CD. The album closer &quot;Goodnight, Hollywood Blvd&quot; is very moody and striking, but a good note to end the album with. There's certainly a lot to take in here. The only problem with the album is, it does lack the spirit and emotional support that his debut did, but still it did win him a lot of new fans, and it's not all that bad anyway. Give it a chance.
0688163173|5.0|If you have a taste for really good books, and a willingness to trust a very fine author, than you have to give yourself the pleasure of reading Dennis Lehane's compelling suspense/mystery SHUTTER ISLAND.  The book starts with a seemingly can't miss set of circumstances:  U.S. Marshall Terry Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule set out by Ferry Boat for Shuttter Island, an isolated psychiatric prison/hospital for the criminally insane.  Their official objective is to find a patient who has seemingly escaped into thin air.  But Daniels, a man tormented by a violent and sad past, has other reasons for accepting the assignment.  He is in search for the person potentiaaly reponsible for his wife's death.  And also hopes to find evidence of unethical psychiatric surgical practices for a U. S. Senator.  The island and it's cast of character's - from the creepy but somewhat kind Dr. Crawley, to the mysterious and unavailable prison warden - are classic Gothic Horror.  But from the time they arrive on the island nothing is quite as it seems.  When a hurricane strikes the island all hell brakes loose and just as magically the missing patient is found.  I wont give any more away.  But it is safe to say that at this point the story takes more twists and turns than a modern roller coaster.  Lehane carries the story along with beautiful prose and flexes his lierary muscle, as the story corkscrews it's way to an amazing but equaling shocking ending.  This is by no means a feel good book, nor is it a \\"light\\" read as some might think.  But if you are willing to put yourself in the hands of the author you will be richly rewarded.  I can't think of a single book to really compare it to.  It has faint similarities to William Wharton's cult classic BIRDY.  And as I read the book I couldn't help but think of Doris Lessing's THE FIFTH CHILD for mood and distinctive language.  The great thing about this book is the ending is highly ambitious but Lehane pulls it off beautifully.  I feel fortunate that this is the fisrt Lehane book for me.  Because I don't bring any preconceived hopes for the book that longtime fans of his detective series seem to have.  I don't have any base of reference to be disapointed in comparison.  This is a terrific book on many levels.  It's so cliched,, but I literally stayed up all night reading this book from cover to cover.  There never seemed a good place to put the book down.  If you are looking for a good read that has more to it than preformulated fluff,  Thin SHUTTER ISLAND is a nust read.fortunate that this is the fisrt Lehane book for me.

B00008LDPU|4.0|Personally, I love the Animatrix, and I believe the Wachowski brothers repay a large debt of gratitude and creative license to the Japanese animation industry by exposing so many talented animators and directors through this collection.<br />However, those hoping to get all of their Matrix-universe questions answered before the release of \\"Matrix: Revolutions\\" may be sorely disappointed by this showcase.  Although some short films provide backstory (more in the descriptions below), they are also standalone pieces.  The strength of this collection is in the strength of its contributors, and it provides a diverse cross-section of modern Japanese anime which will give the uninitiated an opportunity to see what's being produced.<br />The short films in the collection are:<br />\\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" - This short produced by Square (also the production company for some of the best video games of the past decade, and the \\"Final Fantasy\\" film) provides an almost creepy example of \\"digital actors\\" whose skin texture, bounce and movement are nearly impossible to distinguish from the real thing.  Only their lip sync gives it away.  The story involves the captain and pilot of the Osiris, the doomed ship which (in the Reloaded timeline) sends the warning to Zion that the machines are digging.  It is also a direct introduction to the \\"Enter the Matrix\\" video game, as it depicts the drop of the letter which Niobe or Ghost must retrieve from a post office in the first act of the game.<br />\\"The Second Renaissance, Parts I and II\\" - If one can overlook the fact that more information is contained in this \\"Zion Archive file\\" than Morpheus told Neo the humans knew, these two short films provide a compelling and lushly illustrated history of the fall of humanity and the rise of the machines.  In particular, the fluid art style and the haunting voice-over make this an easy 18 minutes to spend, and it invokes more sympathy for the machines than you'll get from the human-centric viewpoint of the Matrix films.<br />\\"Program\\" is the weakest film in the series; mercifully, it is short.  Although the animation style is as classic in the world of anime as \\"Snow White\\" is in the world of Disney, the story line is weak.  I enjoy this more if I turn down the sound and just watch.<br />\\"World Record\\" attempts to illustrate what happens to a human in the Matrix whose desire to accomplish something physically pushes him to the brink of the reality he thinks he knows.  The art design is not for everyone, but is beautifully realized with tremendous detail in every cell.  The music is also a plus.  This won't add much to your \\"Matrix IQ\\" but is a very creative exploration of what happens to people whose minds are not freed by the Zionists, and who do not find their way out through a computer.<br />\\"Kid's Story\\" is one of my two favorites on the disc.  It ties into \\"Matrix: Reloaded\\" by telling us how the annoying kid in Zion came to know and love Neo.  It's no secret to those who have seen the film that the kid \\"self-substantiates\\", or gets himself out of the Matrix without help.  His journey to that point, though, is detailed in a lush, deliberately-paced, gorgeously-scored piece of animation that will leave you breathless. One of two films directed by Shinichiro Watanabe of \\"Cowboy Bebop\\" fame.<br />\\"Beyond\\" - Koji Morimoto (an assistant animator on the legendary \\"Akira\\") turns in the most inventive and beautiful short piece of the disc.  It takes a simple question - what would happen if the Matrix's physical rules malfunctioned in some locations? - and explores the answer, from the bizarre physical happenings that children call hauntings to the arrival of futuristic wrecking equipment that razes and rewrites the affected locale.  This, along with \\"Kid's Story\\", makes the DVD worth the price of admission.<br />\\"Detective Story\\" - this black-and-white second entry from director Shinichiro Watanabe plays like a Sam Spade film.  Its comic book style is starkand beautiful, and the addition of Carrie-Anne Moss's voice really grounds it in the Matrix universe.  At the end of the day the story doesn't matter much, but it's an enjoyable nine minutes all the same.<br />\\"Matriculated\\" - Peter Chung (of Aeon Flux) shows a real flair here for art, but tells a somewhat convaluted story of humans who try to get machines to \\"choose\\" to betray their own kind.  My complaint with this piece is not its technical execution, which is brilliant and shows that Chung dedicated himself to improving an already great talent, but rather in its plot.  Like \\"Program\\", watch this one for the art.and beautiful, and the addition of Carrie-Anne Moss's voice really grounds it in the Matrix universe.

B000092ZYX|4.0|With this effort, Radiohead have returned to accessibility (at least music-wise) of &quot;OK COMPUTER&quot; for the sake of getting the cat out of the bag.  Some of the songs are even radio friendly, a development any faithful listener of &quot;KID A&quot; would find absolutely shocking.  Why are they returning to guitars and the catchy hooks of &quot;Paranoid Android?&quot;  It may have something to do with the fact the this world has slowly decayed into a dismal place, with injustices afloat, and if we don't watch out, &quot;tiny&quot; endeavors like letting the Bush administration infiltrate/explode Iraq will morph into bigger catastophes that could have been prevented had we not let too much power in one country's hands.  This has happened countless times thoroughout history, and it can happen again.  &quot;HAIL TO THE THIEF,&quot; (at least, to me) is a warning.    <br />I didn't want to review this album until I had completely absorbed it like a sponge.  But its overall tone and texture has captured me so, that I must encourage all former Radioheads to consider purchasing it as soon as possible.  <br />I actually got my hands on an advanced copy a couple weeks ago, but as with all previous albums, I need the lyrics to fully understand and marvel at the strength of each song.  &quot;HAIL TO THE THIEF&quot; is very paranoid, ironic in its paranoia, anti-Republican/corporate-greed-infastructure, and anti-ignorance, but this is all done through using gorgeous hooks, plenty of advantageous, meaningful use of the music technology featured in &quot;KID A&quot; and &quot;AMNESIAC,&quot; and, best of all, Thom Yorke's heavenly voice brings stark irony to every paranoid, dismal word sung on the album's sonic landscape.  <br />So although because the simple lack of time and resources have prevented me from even beginning to soak up and analyze this album as of yet, I would presume that any Radiohead fan out here would not have to think twice before picking up &quot;HAILTO THE THIEF.&quot; The title is enough enticement for anyone who has believed in the Radiohead cause all along.  <br />So, until the inevitable live album comes out, let your eardrums enjoy this challenging maze of gems shining amid the barren desert of alt-rap-corporate rock clogging the airwaves and Best Buy CD racks...because the non-Republoican Presidential hopefuls are definitely not stepping up to the plate.
B00004XONN|5.0|On Kid A, Radiohead doesn't just abandon their previous sound, they abandon everything that makes a rock band a rock band.  Guitars are replaced with keyboards and effects, drums are replaced with programmed beats, hooks are replaced with nonsensical lyrics and hard-to-discern melodies.  With that being said, the music on Kid A is intriguing.  On the first listen, the album is impossible to decipher.  The electronic songs seemingly go nowhere and the only inklings of clarity come through &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; and &quot;Optimistic&quot;.  After a few more listens, the melodies start to poke through like rays of sunlight through clouds.  Before you know it, the album makes perfect sense and you are addicted, all you have to do is perservere.    It's not to say that Kid A will please everyone, however.  Many who enjoyed Radiohead's earlier albums hate this and believe the band is soiling their good name, but most of these people only gave Kid A one spin before judging it.  I've listened to Kid A countless times and I love this album. <br />What makes the CD so intriguing is not only the electronic instrumentation, but the strong songwriting.  Much of the album would sound like a bunch of guys jerking-off-in a musical sense of course- if it weren't apparent that the songs are all extremely well written.  Everything In It's Right Place is a great opener for the album, establishing the sound and throwing in enough hooks to be accessible.  The subsequent title track is one of my personal favorites, consising of unintelligible lyrics sung through some type of machine strewn across a childlike melody, making for an interesting and moving listen.  The National Anthem consists of the band and an entire horn section going nuts over a simple bass riff.  How To Disappear Completely provides respite for those craving guitars, as they abound in this hauntingly beautiful acoustic piece.  The only true downside to the CD is Treefingers.  This &quot;song&quot; is basically 3-4 minutes of pleasant noise that apparently came from a guitar.  Yeah guys, that was probably pretty fun to make, but unfortunatey there is nothing to the track and it interrupts the CD's terrific flow (although it can provide a nice breather to go get a bottle of water or something).  After that the CD picks the pace back up with the guitar driven rocker entitled Optimistic, complete with wonderful lyrics and melody.  In Limbo is a continuation of Optimistic but by no means the same song.  The chorus of &quot;You're living in a fantasy world&quot; sung by Thom Yorke is truly menacing.  Next is Idioteque which is dominated by a club beat and melodic synthesizer line; the vocals on this song are something to behold.  The album begins to wind down with Morning Bell, a subdued but intense key-driven song (no surprise there) with graphic lyrics.  The album closer is the astonishing Motion Picture Soundtrack, which is one of Thom Yorke's favorite songs.  The song is sparse but very moving and a fitting end to an enigma of a CD.  <br />I have but one complaint about Kid A:  it is apparent that the band is self conscious about letting some hooks slip out.  Case in point: Morning Bell.  There is a wonderful moment where the song is blown open and given some room to breathe, an immediately appealing &quot;hook&quot;.  Before this section of the song can really take flight, it's abruptly ended and the song carries on like before.  It seems like the members of Radiohead were concsciously trying to make the song &quot;difficult&quot;.  Unfortunately, this is one of the times that beauty is ignored.  Other than that small point, this CD is a knockout.  It marked the future of Radiohead and solidified them as more than just a flash in the pan with one spectacular album (OK Computer).  If you are looking to become a Radiohead fan don't start here, get The Bends or OK Computer first.  If you like those albums and are willing to embrace Radiohead's artistic vision and challenge yourself with Kid A, buy this CD without hesitation.  Thanks for the read.  <br />Dan
B000092Q7O|5.0|As cheesy and cliche as it sounds, this movie made me laugh, cry, and swear at the television when Chicago won Best Picture at the Acadamy Awards instead of this amazing piece of history. Unlike some other dolled up accounts of the Holocaust, this movie was terribly honest, showing brutal deaths, and even more brutal survivals, which this movie is about. <BR>The Pianist tells the story of Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, who's at the beginning of a promising piano career and a romance with a Christian woman when he and his family are cruelly forced into the ghettos, seperated by a thick brick wall from the rest of society. He manages to evade being sent to a concentration camp, but faces even worse horrors in the death of his family, his time spent at a ghetto work camp, and the hidden apartments that he lives in while waiting for the end of the war. <BR>The entire movie is backed by gorgeous music (piano, naturally) that is perfectly suited for the scene in which it is placed. Stunning camera shots also capture the horrors of the Holocaust, without becoming too cheesy or overdone. <BR>Although the movie's score and cinematography are excellent, the real heart of the movie is in Adrien Brody, the previously unkown Best Actor. He carries off the role flawlessly in every word, movement, and facial expression. I found myself crying with him, feeling terror when he felt terror, and even feeling hungry when he felt that way. This will definately be a movie to buy, and watch over and over again.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this after I got tickets to go to one of Norah's concerts (though I had only ever heard her sing &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;). When I first listened to it, I didn't get what all the &quot;hype&quot; was about (all the awards, etc.). However, I have now listened to this disc close to 40 times, and it is on my list of favorites. It's great for relaxing, and I listen to it constantly while I'm at work, since it isn't at all distracting. Norah's voice has a very sultry appeal, and nothing seems forced, which is a nice change from a lot of music that's out there now. I especially like &quot;Don't Know Why,&quot; &quot;Seven Years,&quot; &quot;Feelin' the Same Way,&quot; &quot;Come Away with Me,&quot;......oh wait...I especially like them all! (though if I had to choose, I'd say I'm not as big of a fan of &quot;I've Got to See You Again&quot; or &quot;Lonestar.&quot;) This is a great addition to anyone's collection.
B00006JDVV|2.0|I passionately agree with all the bashing this major RIP-OFF has been getting.  Remember those scary posters of dragons burning out London as Apache Copters do intense battle with them?  Or that compelling trailer of the flying monsters destroying the world?  Well, SURPRISE!, none of that is here! And thereby, hangs the [problem]!The opening scene where the first male dragon escapes from an underground excavation site was generating some fearsome suspense.  HOWEVER, we are then shot ahead twenty years later - after everything BAD has already happened; like most of the world being incinerated by hordes of more fire-breathers, which is ineptly restricted to a (count um) ONE minute montage of old clippings you can barely read. BUMMER! THAT was the story I wanted to see.  How could it have not delivered, being if it had a decent script and compelling characters.  I like Bale and McConaughey, they show some real acting potential, but give them better roles in a more intriguing story that would have delivered the action, thrills and overwhelming sense of dread and terror.  It's called EXCITING!!!I wanted to see those crucial attacks on civilization and the destruction of all the world's major cities. Who wouldn't?  Doesn't sound too dull or insignificant.  With so much justified criticisms of how most films today are overloaded with too many F/X, this is one unique case that NEEDED far more startling visuals.  It's no longer the matter that \\"it can't be done.\\"  DO IT!!!Also, it would have been cool to have that shocking scene where the scientists finally realize that the dragons caused the dinosaur's extinction and began the ice age.  That was an interesting idea by itself, but it just gets skipped over like it's 'no big deal.'  How about an eerie flashback that SHOWS this 'historical' event.  Too many dismal films indulge that 'much ado about nothing' notion.  THIS film indulges 'little ado about everything'.  Those are the wrong kind of ironies.  ROF had so much potential.  You could produce a whole epic of how the human race fought the dragon invasion - and eventually lost.  On ROF's 'message board' are some interesting ideas of how this vast disappointment could have been solved. If interested, I suggest you check it. I know of many discerning viewers who would love to see an awesome PREQUAL that could do full justice with this strong potential.  Sad to say, since this mess bombed, that great unmade movie will probably never materialize, but it still should be seriously considered.  DRAG WARS could really fly.  I rest my frustrated case.
0441003257|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but while reading I kept wondering how the story was going to be dragged out all the way to the end of the book. The story itself didn't really have a dragged on feel, I would just look at how far I was in the book and what was going on. Good book. I had gotten used to the Discworld and was momentarialy set of balance to find that this is not related. The riders of the apocalypse are not quite the same as the ones I had gotten used to on the Discworld.

B00008H2LB|5.0|I suppose I should start off by saying I wasn't going to give this album five stars because of one factor: the length of the CD. I felt it was just too short to warrant an absolutely perfect review, but after listening to 75 droning minutes of Metallica's new record, I suddenly find that I have no problems giving this five stars. Definitely Quality over quantity.<br />I enjoy the way Linkin Park have risen above the mundane sound of rock/rap, a combination I otherwise despise. Somehow Linkin Park manage to make it sound so natural, seamless and effortless. Good lyrics, great melodies mixed with some heavy beats and pretty good muscianship by all the guys in the band. These guys know their stuff, they're just not interested in showing off and being flash players for all and sundry to admire. And it's because of that attitude that everything in Meteora flows together beautifully. A big, big plus point for me is the distinct absence of profanity on the CD. It's absolute bliss to listen to great music without the distractions and frankly irritations of swear words punctuating each thought and idea. <br />Why should you buy Meteora? Simple, because this is a CD that you can play dozens of times over and not get fed up with it. With each listen, every song takes on another texture. Meteora is like an onion, each layer reveals yet another layer, and another and another, resulting in a CD that is rich in sound and depth.  <br />Meteora might be short but it's oh so very sweet.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Radiohead's new album \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is everything i expected. To me it's a mixture of \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Ok Computer.\\"  This CD is filled with great songs.  \\"A Wolf at the Door\\" is my favorite song on the CD.  EXCELLENT!!!
B000001ESP|5.0|Moving Pictures is considered by many to be Rush's masterpiece. I can't argue that statement. The sound they achieved on this record is pure. All instruments sound relentless in capturing sonic perfection.Rush had just finished touring for their last album Permenant Waves, and without taking much of a break headed into Le Studio to record. As a band I believe they were peaking creatively.Expanding upon a newer sound they had developed from PW.More synthesizers are being used.Neil's drumming is the most powerful, technical, creative,wicked, compositions to date.Geddy's bass playing is precise and heavy. Alex has perfected his signature sound.Wow!!! Awesome record!!!<BR>   1. Tom Sawyer- The most identifiable rush song ever.If I here this song on the radio I still get pumped up, turn volume to 36, and speed away. Classic raw energy rush. Neil's drum rolls during instumental section knock your socks off.Lyrics are cool too.    10/10<BR>   2. Red Barchetta-Awesome song about the beauty of joyriding in a classic car in the future. Song takes you away to the fuutuuure!!Band plays flawlesly.    10/10<BR>   3. Limelight-Song continues at classic rush pace. Trials of being in the spotlight and having to give up freedom for dreams of expressing yourself publiclly. The guitar solo is one of alex's best ever.   10/10<BR>   4. YYZ-Instumental that Jams. YOu listen to it you gotta move your body(preferably with a female rush fan)   10/10<BR>   5. The Camera Eye-Side 2- Their last long song jam. About the differences of london and new york. But both share a common beauty.The song flows nicely.   8/10<BR>   6. Witch Hunt(part 3 of fear)-Scary intro leads to keyboard heavy ending. About fear leading to mob mentality.Their scariest song ever.   8/10<BR>   7. Vital Signs-It's all about deviating from the norm. Step in a different direction more so like next album Signals. Snthesizer looped into song is rockin.   10/10<BR>         This album is flawless,and don't fear it definatley will have you headbangin. The definitive Rush album!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I went and bought this the day it came out and it is an absolute masterpiece.  Every single song on this record is just amazing.  Faceless is probably one of the greatest metal songs to come out in a while.  Sullys vocal are just unbelievable, the guitars are as heavy as I have ever heard them, drums are amazing, and the bass is kickin.<BR>   This is A great album.....and I recommend it to everyone. Cya
B000002UEB|5.0|I know it's been said here many times, but this really is one of the best hard rock CDs you can buy.  It is so phenominal I can't even find words to do it justice.  This is a concept CD - meaning there is a full-length story being told in music form.  It's like watching a movie, only you're listening to it in music form instead.  These guys have always impressed me with their intelligent lyrics and artistic music.  I was introduced to this group with this release back in college, and today, it still remains my all-time favorite hard rock CD.  There is not a single dud on this disc - even the real short songs add so much to the whole experience.  I guess if I had to pick favorite songs, it would be \\"Speak\\", \\"Spreading the Disease\\", \\"I Don't Believe in Love\\", and \\"Breaking the Silence\\".  There is an incredible story being told here and I won't spoil it for anyone - you need to figure it out for yourself - that's part of the fun.  I have found many people who have differing opinions about what certain elements in the story mean, which is very cool and smart of Queensryche to write them that way.  I will admit, though, this is a disc that kind of grows on you with each listen, so don't just listen to it once and say you don't like it.  If you stick with it; you'll be amazed how much you will like it!!
B00005JLRT|2.0|A very unsatisfying entry into the Trek saga. It falls into the same trap that Die Another Day fell into around the same time. The film makers seem to be trying to reinvent the franchises in a mould they think will appeal to the 'new generation'. By doing so they lose all the things that made the earlier films so popular and entertaining. Bond films aren't Die Hard. Trek films aren't Solaris. People want to know why this film made the least money of all. What's the mystery? It's a dull, slow, uninvolving movie.<br />Don't get me wrong, I'm all for Trek exploring deeper themes and I'm not saying they all have to be light hearted romps. But a balance of tone is crucial in any movie. And that's where this film falls down. It's just not fun to watch. Surely, whatever the story or themes, Star Trek should always be fun to watch.<br />**POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD**<br />And the greatest disappointment of all is the throwaway death of one of the main characters. Frankly you can see it coming from early on and the fact that the 'death' is clearly set up at the end to be non-lasting merely robs it of any emotional impact. Compare it to the end of Wrath of Khan to see what I mean. Even though we know Spock comes back, that film still packs an emotional wallop after many viewings.<br />It reminds me, obscurely enough, of a Doctor Who episode where he farewells his robot dog K9 then goes back into the TARDIS and pulls out a box labeled K9: Mark 2.<br />You'll know what I mean when you see it.<br />It was a sad disservice to a beloved character and indicative of the weakness of this film overall. Rent it, don't buy it.
B000002MU3|4.0|I was very glad when R.E.M. released &quot;Monster&quot;, which was such a departure from their previous two releases.  While certainly not their best, it once again proves to everyone that these guys can do ANY kind of music and it works for them.  This was a departure from the mainstream, which did excite some long-time fans.  I love almost every song on here, especially &quot;I Don't Sleep, I Dream&quot; and &quot;Circus Envy&quot;.  While the very best of R.E.M. can be found pre-&quot;Out of Time&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot; was a welcomed change of pace from mainstream and very full of noise, but Michael's lyrics are as strong as ever and carry each song in the midst of all the noise.
0446608955|5.0|This book is sooooo different from the movie! It's so different, that it almost seems like a completely different story. This book is even set in the 50s or 60s, but the movie was set in recent times because the producers wanted the viewers to connect on a more personal basis. While I enjoyed the movie better than the book, the book is still very good. So, I recommend it! :)
B00008GKEG|4.0|It would be hard to single out any other  musical group whose appeal and impact cut across several generations -- from contemporaries who listened to songs that were \\"hits before your mother was born\\" to today's hip-hop generation.<br />The Beatles pervaded politics, religion, economics and lifestyles world-wide( although not everybody agrees with them) -- yet, their greatest impact is still the intensity and timelessness of their music: Yesterday, In my Life, Twist and Shout, Help, Strawberry Fields Forever, A Day in the Life, I-me-mine,etc.  with the 5.1 DTS system bringing them to life like no other.<br />The DVD contains encyclopedic trivia that may not be so trivial to die-hard fans: \\"When I'm 64\\", was written by John when he was 16; Eleanor Rigby's name came from a Tombstone, etc.; No, it's not true that the Beatles are more popular than Jesus; Yes, they snubbed the Marcoses but not the people; Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is not that, and more.<br />For a mix of nostalgic fun and an ambivalent reminder of the wonder years in each of us, this DVD is much like the Beatles -- a classic.
B000092ZYX|2.0|During the sessions for this album, the word was that this was going to be Radiohead's return to guitar-based rock.  Well, no such luck.  Hail To The Thief is a continuation of the experimental leanings heard on Kid A and Amnesiac, but with diminishing returns.  The band is still staying away from anything resembling traditional verse-chorus-verse songs, and your enthusiasm for the album will be in direct proportion to your tolerance for the direction their music has taken.  Even so, this is not a strong set of songs; the music is simply unmemorable, with little to draw the listener in and stay in the mind.  Atmospheric and impressionistic, but ultimately self-indulgent and snooze-inducing, it's their weakest album.
B00006LLNU|5.0|And none of them give this album enough credit.  Scarier still, they are even better live.  <br />I've read many negative reviews.  I guess this band is hard to get into, but after I heard Track 4 for the first time, I was hooked.  Maybe it's just that we are in a pop world devoid of any dynamics that makes them sing out to me.  Maybe I'm tired of the same old verse-chorus-verse-chorus-(maybe solo)-chorus two-minute deal that seems to be the current formula of music...<br />But this album talks to me.  With words that I don't know.  I have listened to this album 40 times over waiting in a Cincinatti Airport waiting for my standby tickets to clear... and I never tired of it.<br />My only gripe (If there was a 4.5 stars) is that songs 1-4 and 8 sing out so well that 5-7 falls into a bit of a lull.  They're not bad by any means, but I think the others are just stronger.
B000092ZYX|5.0|All I feel about this album has already been said - I just wanted to voice my agreement.  Hail to the Thief = nice.
B00004XONN|5.0|Where's my guitar rock?  What happened to OK Computer?  It's gone!  This is in its place....???<br />Some people listened to it, and others blocked it out.<br />I can grab the guitar and play anything on OK Computer and get some cheers and some grumbles.  Sing &quot;In Limbo&quot; off this album into any woman's ear and she'll melt.  There's an eerie power behind the music on this CD.  I heard originally the last track was supposed to much longer.  I wish it was.<br />If all bands evolved the way Radiohead did (That is, the overall change from the beginning album to the current album...not necesserily the same genre path), I would be much happier with music right now.<br />Still one of the CD's I go back to constantly on the 400 CD changer.  Has not died out on me in the least.  Usually play it right after some early Talking Heads.<br />If you like this album, I strongly suggest seeing this band live.  They take these songs and change them, add things, delete things...you get mutations, and all of them are great.
B00005JLH2|5.0|This was a GREAT film and it really showed African American universities in a new refreshing way!  No one ever did a film highlighting the AWESOME bands in traditionally black colleges.  This film did an OUSTANDING job in that and the actors were perfect for their roles!
B00005B36H|3.0|Now I've listened to this album many times, have had it forced down my throat many more times, but I still come to the same conclusion:  It's not up to the Tool standard.<br />The most amazing thing about Tool's previoius albums were how much each instrument (including vocals) were integral in each song.  Stand alone, each part is interesting;  As a whole, it's phenomonal.  On Lateralus, however, many things fall apart.  Most notably are the lead vocals in my opinion.  Many times I find Maynard just singing what the guitar is playing...Schism being the most obvious example of it.  Are there moments of Tool Genious?  There sure are.  Does anything on this album compare to the feeling you get after listening to all of Undertow, or the amazement in your eyes after lying on the floor listening to Third Eye blaring out of your speakers?  Not for me.  My expectations were high, but not unreasonable.  Tool has fallen from being an experience and is now a mortal band.
B000058T5E|4.0|When I first listened to this album, I really didn't like it except for a few standout tracks (Blackbird, Rosebud, Roy's Toy, and a couple others). Now that I've been listening to it off and on for awhile now, I've liked it more, but comparing it to such ingenious albums as Blow by Blow, Wired, and Guitar Shop is ridiculous. While 90% of the material by Jeff Beck conquers (almost) anything by a modern guitarist (that emphatically includes Clapton's recent material), the genious of Beck must be put to the test of his more skillful outtings. This is quite experimental, but there's really nothing new or 'experimental' done here, just a lot of loops and repeating riffs (spectacular though they are). <BR>So the end result for me is that if you're a Jeff Beck fan then get this CD by all means (but make sure you've heard Blow by Blow, Guitar Shop, and Wired first - to appreciate Beck's full genious), but if you're new to Beck then listen to the aforementioned albums first. Not a bad album at all actually.
B000002LRX|5.0|Many people have covered this album to a full extent...<br />The title of the album definitely leads me to believe where the delusional feel to half the songs come from...ok maybe all the songs.<br />Caffeine picks you up and tosses you around, refusing to let you go.<br />Jizzlobber is my favorite on the album.  I'm a sucker for an organ and singers forgetting where reality is.<br />Each song is glorious.
B00005AREQ|5.0|The first album someone interested in hearing Jeff Beck's musical genious should get (yes, pass up any greatest hits or best of selections). It's funk, fusion, jazz - with healthy doses of rock and blues. The great thing about the band on this album is that they're all very good at their respective instruments. Of course we all know that Beck is going to be great, but it's surprising when fellow band members can equal the equivalent of his talent on their own instruments. This is, in my opinion, Beck's best album - and in saying that I mean one that showcases his versatility and intelligent playing. All these songs sound like jams, but they don't have the rawness or 'rough areas' of jams - wow.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Take your pick on what Radiohead should have done.  Should they have made a double album?  Should they have made a &quot;Best of&quot; this and Kid A?  Should they have swapped some songs around?<br />It's tough to tell, but Amnesiac didn't fulfill me as much as Kid A.  I think half the problem is, once the album is on, I know there are good songs before Dollars and Cents, but it's hard not to just skip to that song.  It blows me away.  I've played this song to the older, classic rock generation (Anything 80's and later is garbage), and to classical musicians (Pop music is terrible)... they all are impressed.<br />I really fell for &quot;I Might be Wrong&quot;, but then when I heard the live version, I wondered why they played it so slow on the album.  The live version has a better feel to it, in my opinion.<br />I was impressed, but expected just a little more.

B000002HD5|5.0|This album does not sound like anything else, it is quite unique. I see people call it R&B and Soul but I don't find at all as I can hardly listen that kind of music. I cannot find connections to any group. Definitively alternative. <br />Songs have catchy melodies, but suddendly somewhere in the song, they all degenerate in a hard and inharmonic way. I think it fit pretty well with the lyrics which are very self-degenerating and not harmonic with the general conception of love. You really have to listen to understand. Avoid \\"when we two parted\\" and \\"I keep coming back\\".
B000092ZYX|5.0|\\"Hail to the Thief\\". I...can't...resist...awesome...music!!!! HTTT is, so far, after 10 listens, an EXCELLENT CD.<br />Standout tracks for me so far:<BR>2+2=5 Opens up with the familiar sound of goofing around with the pickup switch on the guitar, but it sounds like something's wrong. Threw me off right at the beginning. Then, rolling guitar comes in and Thom singing near and at falsetto. Beautiful. Then, 180 degrees turn into a great punk-type song which, dare I say it...rocks.<br />Sit Down, Stand Up. The opening beat sounds like a cheap Casio synth drum loop. Then a hypnotic piano part comes in and I'm lost in this song. It turns into urgent chaos later with a sped up, almost latin beat, another surprise that I totally dig.<br />Go To Sleep. So far, by far, my FAVORITE track on the CD. A beautiful acoustic guitar intro with a bass line bouncing around. Alternate tuning for sure. Then, a steady beat comes in with the bass line driving everything. The KICKER comes in at 1:32. Those syncopated chords and notes are just too cool for words. I can't explain how it makes me feel other than I feel like I can take over the world with this song. By the CD for this song.<br />There, There. Opening tom-toms kicking out a slick, jazzy beat. Cool all the way through.<br />Myxomatosis. I looked it up. A disease which infects rabbits. This has to be the best song about that disease ever made. Well, that's not saying much. However, with the fuzz bass and the off-beat drums driving this one, you can't resist this one.<br />I'm not a great reviewer of CDs, but this CD is excellent in my opinion. Radiohead continues to push the envelope, creating music that is listenable, but full of art, ideas, jams, melancholy, joy, fear, and blinding brilliance. If you want to get into something that without question blows away what everyone else is doing, pick up this CD and listen to it about 5 times.
0738206679|5.0|Frankly, I found this to be an unusually challenging book to read the first time and therefore re-read it before organizing my thoughts for this review. The Five Star rating correctly indicates my high regard for what Barabasi has accomplished as he attempts to help his reader to think in terms of networks in new and different (probably unfamiliar) ways. His book \\"is about how networks emerge, what they look like, and how they evolve.\\" With meticulous care, he presents \\"a Web-based view of nature, society, and business, a new framework for understanding issues ranging from democracy on the Web to vulnerability of the Internet and the spread of deadly viruses.\\" Along the way, Barabasi challenges the concept of \\"The Random Universe,\\" asserting instead that everything is connected to everything else. He devotes most of his book to explaining the significance of that global interconnectedness to business, science, and everyday life.<br />As a non-scientist, I am unqualified to comment on much of the material which Barabasi shares. Perhaps he wrote this book for non-scientists such as I who nonetheless struggle to understand what Barabasi characterizes as the \\"mystery of life\\" which begins with the intricate web of interactions and thereby integrates the millions of molecules within each organism. \\"The enigma of the society starts with the convoluted structure of the social network....[For that reason] networks are the prerequisite for describing any complex system, indicating that complexity theory must inevitably stand on the shoulders of network theory. It is tempting to step in the footsteps of some of my predecessors and predict whether and when we will tame complexity.\\" Given all that has been accomplished thus far with regard to disentangling the networks following the discovery of scale-free networks, Barabasi concludes, \\"Once we stumble across the right vision of complexity, it will take little to bring it to fruition. When [in italics] that will happen is one of the mysteries that keeps many of us going.\\"<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Mark Buchanan's Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks, Stanley Kaufman's At Home in the Universe: The Search for Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity as well as The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution, Steven Strogatz' Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order, Duncan J. Watts' Six Degrees: the Science of a Connected Age, and Stephen Wolfram's A New Kind of Science.<br />I probably should add Ed Regis' The Info Mesa: Science, Business, and the New Alchemy on the Santa Fe Plateau. Regis devotes almost all of his attention to individuals and events who and which, over several decades, had a profound impact on essentially the same subjects as those discussed in the books previously recommended. Also, Regis examines in much greater detail than do the other authors how core concepts about networks and their complexity were introduced to the commercial marketplace by various entrepreneurs.f the mysteries that keeps many of us going.\\"<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Mark Buchanan's Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks, Stanley Kaufman's At Home in the Universe: The Search for Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity as well as The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution, Steven Strogatz' Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order, Duncan J.

B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol's 'Turn On The Bright Lights' is simply an amazing album.  I am not a huge fan of Joy Division, the Cure, and other bands Interpol is compared to, but that didn't matter when I started listening.  From the hypnotic opener, \\"Untitled,\\" to the closing \\"Leif Erikson,\\" this disc is brimming with beautiful music.  Minimalist at times, complex and overbearing at others, it straddles melody and off-tune, off-kilter chaos.  Just when you think a song is over, it veers off into another rewarding direction.  PDA, NYC, Obstacle 1, Roland... they are all incredible.  The best $... loss-leader CD I've ever purchased at Best Buy.  On a side note, see them live if you can--for me they were the standout at this year's WBCN River Rave, in an otherwise disappointing lineup.  Their tight performance was totally unexpected and it blew me away.
0688163173|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Dennis Lehane but I'm sure it won't be the last.  On \\"Shutter Island\\" Lehane has his two investigators, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule investigating the disapperance of a patient at a mental hospital on Shutter Island.  However, prudence forbids me to go any further with the plot because I wouldn't want to give any of it away.  Suffice it to say, it kept me spellbound as few books have done recently.  I was always wanting to pick it up to see what's going to happen to the investigators or their situations.  The amazing ending threw me for a loop as I never saw it coming.  As for those people who say its too dark or depressing--hey, not everything is moonlight and canoes.  That's life.  If you can't handle it, don't critize the writer for writing it.  Go buy a comic book instead.  But if you want a good story, with a really good ending, buy \\"Shutter Island.\\"
B00005JLPK|5.0|Many people I know who are long-time admirers of the life and times of the great Mexican artist, Frida Kahlo, have mixed feelings about this film.  On one hand, they admire the way the whole film itself looks like some of her paintings, but they are upset with the fact that it focuses more on her sex life than anything else.<br />While this may be true, there are more than enough strong elements in this film to make it a dazzling success and, in my opinion, one of the best films of 2002.<br />Director Julie Taymor seems to have mastered the art of mise-en-scene with this film.  Everything the viewer is subjected to is nothing short of stunning.  Like Kahlo, Taymor uses a palate with so many different colors to shade this film.<br />Salma Hayek, who championed this project, gives the performance of her career.  Whether she is playing the young, awkward, teenage Kahlo at the beginning of the film, the sassy and bold Kahlo in her twenties and thirties, or the frail, aging, yet determined Kahlo at the end of the film, Hayek is always convincing and intense.<br />As good as Hayek is, Alfred Molina, as Diego Rivera, all but steals the show.  Molina has to be one of the most underrated actors out there.  He perfectly captures the eccentric, moody, yet extremely lovable artist that Rivera was.  Having put on tremendous weight for the role (or just wearing lots of padding), Molina portrays Rivera as an inspirational and lovable ladies man.  How the Academy didn't even give him a nomination is beyond me.<br />Geoffrey Rush appears later in the film giving yet another excellent performance, this time as the Russian exile Trotsky.  In addition, look for great cameos by the likes of Edward Norton, Ashley Judd and Antonio Banderas.<br />Some may be put off by FRIDA, thinking it to be just another biopic about a dead artist.  This film is much more.  Rivera was the communist party chairman for some time in Mexico and got into some trouble for his beliefs when he was in the US for a  while, so besides giving the viewer insights to different aspects of Kahlo's life, this film also touches on the politics and history of not just Mexico, but the entire world during the 1930's and 1940's.<br />This is an important and daring film that comes off incredibly well.  I highly recommend it!so besides giving the viewer insights to different aspects of Kahlo's life, this film also touches on the politics and history of not just Mexico, but the entire world during the 1930's and 1940's.  <BR>This is an important and daring film that comes off incredibly well.

B00005JM93|3.0|Got the DVD and seems I was wrong about the ending and also wrong about whether or not the Tenia cashes in his chips. I love the warning on the cover about flashing lights. No warning about the sordid violence giving you a heart attack. Sign of the times? Originally thought the film was some sort of throwback to the radical feminist rants of the seventies but subsequently discovered it was all improvised (rather well, in fact.) Overall, my memory of this film will be, despite it's horrors, one of laughter. Black comedy slowly giving away to the more lighthearted and touching humour of human relationships. The sixties decor of the lover's flat which I took to be a subtext of the permissivness of the sixties leading to ultimate disaster may be no more than a tribute to the director's favourite director. Sometimes you can read too much into things. 'Irreversible' is definately worth a look.
B000002UA2|4.0|All in all this album is great.  There's nothing wrong with it, which is whats wrong with it.  All the songs are good, but they don't create the mood like most other Pink Floyd albums.  Wish You Were Here, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon and most of their other work you can't put in for backround music.  They demand listening attention in a dark room with surround sound or a great pair of headphones.  This album on the other hand can be backround music, there's nothing bold or expiriemental about it.  Its a fantastic listen, every song is great, just not as thought provoking as the rest of the Pink Floyd catalogue.  I'd actually recommend this album to people new to the band who find their more complex work a little too artsy.  This is still patented Pink Floyd, just done in a hurry.
B000096I9G|5.0|The Cure is arguably one of the most underrated bands on the planet.  Although many people have a vague notion of the Cure as a poppy 80's band (Boys Don't Cry, Just Like Heaven) the true musical genius of the band shines on epics like 100 Years and The Same Deep Water As You.  This DVD showcases the darker side of the Cure that has made them legendary.  It contains absolutely stunning complete performances of arguably their 3 best recordings (Pornography, Disintegration and Bloodflowers).  <br />The editing is very well done in my opinion.  Unlike many 'music video' type DVDs the editing doesn't get in the way of the performance.  If anything it enhances it.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this masterpiece and recommend it whole-heartedly.
B00000K0E5|5.0|After a six-year hiatus from the silver screen, James Bond returned fresher than ever in the 1995 Bond flick, Goldeneye.  Bond also returned with a fresh face in Irish-born Pierce Brosnan of Remington Steele fame, who is the perfect cross between the consummate professional no-nonsense approach of Connery and the debonair, over-the-top playboy superspy persona of Moore.  Discontinuing the trend of the gritty throwbacks of Dalton, the storyline is a lot more involved, swerving back into the scheme of global domination, only with a smarter, reasonable, post-Cold War story.<br />The movie begins at the peak of the Cold War, serving as a background story within a story.  Bond raids a top-secret Soviet chemical weapons facility, along with his partner and close friend, Alec Trevelyan, a.k.a. Agent 006.  Despite losing his best friend, 007 is dedicated to the mission and in a death-defying escape, Bond is successful in destroying the weapons facility.  Nine years later, Bond is on the trail of an ex-Soviet fighter pilot, Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), who works for the Janus crime syndicate and eventually hijacks the Tiger Helicopter, an aircraft which could withstand electromagnetic pulses.  It turns out a Russian defector, General Ouroumov (Gottfried John) of whom also \\"killed\\" Trevelyan nine years prior, is also a frontman for Janus and he tags along with Onatopp as they snatch a top-secret space satellite device dubbed Goldeneye, destroy the facility in Severnaya home to the Goldeneye, and utilize the Tiger Helicopter as a getaway chopper.  Bond is led to St. Petersburg, where the Tiger was last sighted, to take down Janus and his minions.  The task gets a lot harder for Bond as he finds out Janus, his worst enemy is his best friend, Alec Trevelyan.  To seek revenge on the British for betraying his people, the Cossack Russians in the Second World War, Trevelyan plans to use the Goldeneye to liquidate the British banks and to efface London.  Bond and his lady friend, aSevernaya technician, Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) are off to Cuba to thwart Trevelyan.<br />Brosnan's debut as Bond does not disappoint, as he displays the ruthlessness of Connery and the charm of Moore very well.  Bean portrays Janus/Trevelyan masterfully, a worthy adversary to Bond.  The Bond ladies are worthy additions to the bevy of Bond series, and are solid actresses.  The supporting cast, in particular, Ouroumov, a general with an honorable track record and a tarnished reputation, and Boris Grishenko, the comical computer nerd, is excellent.  The storyline is perfectly executed, urgent but not over-the-top and the action sequences are also first-rate, with Bond's St. Petersburg chase in a military tank and the Bond/Janus fight as the primary highlights.  Overall, Goldeneye is a worthy contender to the title of best Bond film ever.

B000092T56|4.0|&#34;Frida&#34; follows the life of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo from her university days in 1922 until her death in 1954. While still in school, Frida (Salma Hayek) is severely injured in a trolley accident from which she would never fully recover. She lived the rest of her life in pain as a result of the innumerable broken bones she suffered in that accident. Determined to earn a living in spite of her physical condition, she asks artist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) to tell her if her work is good enough to sell. Rivera admires Frida's work very much and takes her on, at first as a protege, then as a lover, then as a wife. The film follows Frida and Rivera's relationship over the course of 25 years of marriage, divorce, and remarriage. We witness Rivera's artistic success and then commercial failure in the United States. And we see Frida's success abroad and, finally, at home in Mexico as she always wished, but which came only shortly before her death. Frida Kahlo's life was haunted -if not consumed- by pain and loss. It was shaped by a fateful accident in her youth. Ironically, if not for the accident, she probably would never have painted. And since she did, we can see the conditions under which she lived expressed in her many paintings.<br /><br />&#34;Frida&#34; is based on Hayden Herrera's biography of Frida Kahlo and is filmed in a largely conventional biopic style in spite of its unconventional subject. At times, Salma Hayek is admirable in her ability to convey how much Frida Kahlo's constant physical pain shaped her life and work. At other times, Hayek's Frida is too agile to be a self-described cripple.  The film does not shy away from depicting Diego Rivera's or Frida Kahlo's Marxist political convictions. But it does place Diego Rivera in a more sympathetic light than I usually see him described. I was under the impression that he was considerably more self-obsessed and dogmatic than he is in &#34;Frida&#34;. But I find no fault with Rivera's character in the movie since the film sees Rivera through his wife's eyes, which love may have blinded to some of his faults.  Salma Hayek is a great admirer of Frida Kahlo and produced &#34;Frida&#34; herself. Many of her Hollywood friends contributed by taking small roles in the film. Edward Norton appears as Nelson Rockafeller, Ashley Judd as photographer Tina Modotti, and Antonio Banderas as David Alfaro Siqueiros. This film doesn't come close to painting a complete picture of Frida Kahlo's character. But it is a solid effort that attempts to bring Kahlo's work to a wider audience. I recommend &#34;Frida&#34; for Salma Hayek's  solid -although overtly self-promoting- performance and for the insight it provides into Frida's Kahlo's work.ie since the film sees Rivera through his wife's eyes, which love may have blinded to some of his faults.

What I call mature readers are not necessarily adults but people who are evolved enough to want a story that is lifelike and not always the stuff where all the 'good' heroes always survived in the end and the 'evil' characters are always defeated but manage to come back in the next instalment. In this book I have been to all the specter of emotions... I couldn't read a new page after Robb was murdered in the most abject and un-hero like fashion... However after a time I continue and accepted the loss and the story gets you up again with Joffrey's death and the lannister's demise from internal conflict, or what happens on the wall and the rise of Samwell the Slayer :)<BR>So if you like linear stories where the bad people wins in the beginning and lose in the end, then this book is definately not for you, go read Jordan or Goodkind and you'll have your fill.  But if you like more evolved stories, then go ahead : schedule a few sleepless nights and read this book :)

0786868694|5.0|I really loved the Lemon Risotto. It turned out great. I like Nigella's style of writing as well, so informal. She doesn't make cooking seem like some competition.  You're free to improvise on her recipes and she even tells you how you can make up your own concoctions for marinades.  I never knew why chicken needed to have some acidic ingredient like lemon or vinegar in the marinade but now I do.  The books reads as if she is talking to you, really cool.

B00000F566|5.0|I have always loved this movie and when I decided to buy this DVD I didn't expect to get the movie, music videos, concert, how the movie was made and lots of other things! It is truly collector's edition. <BR>The movie itself is a beautiful love story with a girl and a boy which we can all be. I think it wakes the best in us.<BR>And one more important thing: after this movie you'll go to dancing lessons, definetly!
B000092ZYX|3.0|Good for Radiohead for making an album that DIDN'T return to the sound of OK Computer and The Bends. Did anything in the history of Radiohead actually make people believe that this would happen.....EVER?  Would we respect and love Radiohead as much if they did do this?  I don't think so.<BR>That being said, I give this album 3 stars because it pretty much sounds like what you would expect from Radiohead after Kid A/Amnesiac.  What's worse, is that none of the songs really stand out for me.  Even with the much maligned Amnesiac (which I liked slightly better than this) had some shining moments like Pyramid Song, Glass House, and Knives Out.  HTTT just kind of meanders a long with some relatively interesting moments, but for the most part, doesn't really grab me.  Almost like I've heard all of this before.  And the electronic experimentation on these albums is definitely getting tiresome, especially when you compare it to some of the great electronic music that is out there these days, such as Boards of Canada.  <BR>I would rate this as their 5th best album, which in a catalog like Radiohead's, definitely means it's worth a listen.  Just not too many listens.
B00005JL78|4.0|'Minority Report' takes place around 50 years from now in a Washington, DC where the Justice System has become an efficient but unfeelingly flawless institution. An experimental program called \\"Pre-Crime\\" has been instated in order to illuminate murder by arresting the murderers before they commit the crime. The program is built around the powers of three psychic teenagers who are never entirely wrong about the murders they predict, but very occasionally will disagree. The dissenting account is called a minority report. <BR>The action of the movie centers on John Anderton (Cruise), a pre-crime officer who lost a child six years prior to the beginning of the movie. Anderton is forced to see the darker side of pre-crime when the pre-cogs predict that he, himself, will murder a man he has never heard of. The plot takes a few more twists and turns before the movie's over, and the writer does a good job of purposefully misleading the audience in order to make the end a surprise.<BR>The best part of this movie is the plot. Interesting and unpredictable, the screen play is near flawless and even ventures into the land of philosophy asking questions such as: \\"Would it be fair to arrest someone for something they never did?\\" I feel this movie deserves four stars largely because I was so impressed with the storyline and philosophical undertones. However, as a whole this movie is not quite there. My personal opinion of Tom Cruise is not a bad one, I certainly think he is attractive and find him a decent actor but for whatever reason in this role I just didn't think he got the job done. <BR>My other big pet peeve was Speilburg's neglect toward providing any explanation for the world his characters are living in. I didn't realize it until I sat down to think about what it was that was bothering me about 'Minority Report', but I walked away from this movie feeling like there was no setting. It was just never set up, and as a result you feel less able to relate to the characters,and more like a spectator. <BR>This movie wasn't awful, but after thinking about it I realized it was something of a disappointment, considering how good I think it could have been.

This album is like a F6(over 300mph) tornado going through a trailer park. There is nothing left when the album is done!<BR>The new album is absolutly terrible! Try not being like Korn and come out with something more original like ...And Justice For All. Possibly though I don't think they will ever top this album!

0151008116|1.0|The Life of Pi may well be the most prominent victim of book hype 2003. Artistically unremarkable dribble about religion and spirituality ends inconclusively and is followed by a pointless survival story. Filled with irrelevant and oftentimes misleading or plainly false comments about zoolifeand biology in general, it seems that some reviewer got carried away by latest wave of &quot;ethnic&quot; authors. Fortunately, lack of talent brings with it a soothing brevity and lack of detail that shortens the ordeal of reading.
B000002HH2|5.0|possibly maybe best work ever done by Bjork,Post is a crossover of idm,trip hop and whatever dance music in the middle 90's is meant to be.From the marvellous orchestration of Isobel,to the exuberance of I miss you Bjork proves there's nothing she can do less than perfect
B000092ZYY|5.0|Disclaimer: I have owned a \\"leaked out onto the internet\\" copy of this album for a few months now, and there are some minute changes to some of the songs on the official record, none of which are bad.  All I can say about this album is that it doesn't surprise me how good it is.  It works much of the same kind of magic on its listener that previous Radiohead albums have done by making it get better and better with each listen.  Upon first listen, no Radiohead album, much less a song, can be truly appreciated.  Sure, one might say \\"hey, that sounds cool\\" or \\"yeah, I like this\\", but only upon repeated sittings can the band's musical genius and depth be fully explored.  This record still has some of the electronic traces of Kid A and its sister album Amnesiac, but it draws more heavily from something new.  It does not sound like OK Computer's surreal dreaminess, but rather it has a much darker, more down-to-earth sound.  To even suggest that the band is drawing from something it has already done would be blasphemy, especially if they were drawing from barely post-pubescent early albums like Pablo Honey and The Bends.  Let's hope they never go down that road again.  Alright, enough rambling; down to the album itself:<BR>     The album's opener \\"2+2=5\\", an allusion to Orwell's \\"1984\\" quickly sets the mood for the entire album and is one of the most well-placed and well-written songs in recent history.  Take what you will about this song's meaning, not to mention the album's meaning; you may or may not believe it is about the Bush administration.  That was the band's intention, much like Icelanders Sigur Ros creating an album sung in gibberish with blank lyrics pages: come up with your own conclusions.  \\"Sit Down. Stand Up\\" is probably my favorite song on the record because of the way it builds and builds with intensity until finally reaching a sensory overload-inducing climax of hyperactive electronica and Thom Yorke saying \\"the raindrops\\" 46 times.  It's irresistable.\\"Sail to the Moon\\" is a relaxer after the first two tracks, and it sort of reminds me of the ethereal sounds of OK Computer.  \\"Backdrifts\\"'s intro may sound reminiscent of Kid A's frigid-atmosphere keyboard and laptop sounds, but it shifts into the darker, more twisted, Grinch smile-inducing that can only be characterized fully on this album.  \\"Go to Sleep\\", rumored to be the next single after \\"There There\\", is a real Thom Yorke dance song, making full use of a beautiful accoustic guitar and Phil Selway's tactful yet catchy drumwork.  \\"Where I End and You Begin\\" takes the listener back to creepy mode, repeating the mumbling of \\"I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive\\".  Somehow that unsettles me.  \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" is somewhat similar to some of the slower tracks on Amnesiac like \\"Pyramid Song\\" and \\"You and Whose Army?\\", and it's even scarier to boot.  The lyrics are phenomenal on this track.  \\"The Gloaming\\", which was the original name of the album, will be the one song out of the entire album to exasperate all of the rock music purists who detest the use of electronics.  The whole song consists of synthesized, dubbed tape looping with Yorke's voice on top.  Nothing this seemingly simplistic has ever been so profoundly tantalizing to the ear.  \\"There There\\", the band's first single from the album, reminds me of nothing I've ever heard by the band.  The intro sounds akin to a dark, wet tavern.  \\"I Will\\".  What can I say about this song?  It's one of Radiohead's most tear-jerkingly, jaw dropping beautiful songs, second perhaps to the \\"I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings\\" non-electronic version of \\"Like Spinning Plates\\".  Or maybe \\"True Love Waits\\".  \\"A Punch-Up at a Wedding\\" is clear evidence of why Yorke calls this album \\"good music to shag to\\".  It sounds slightly in the vein with some of the electro-chill work of Air on the \\"Snatch\\" soundtrack.  Excellent and very catchy song with great bass and piano comping.  \\"Myxamatosis\\", which was actually a virus used in England during the 1950's to wipe out rabbit populations, is a tough song to pick apart.  Yorke has said that many of the lyrics on this album mean absolutely nothing beside the fact that they sound good, and this track just may prove that approach to be true.  \\"Scatterbrain\\" is probably the weakest track on the record, which is saying a lot, because the record is virtually flawless.  It is not a bad song, but it's not quite the best of songs.  \\"A Wolf at the Door\\", whose intro is often accused of sounding like The Animals' \\"House of the Rising Sun\\", ends the album on its familiar dark and scary note, repeating something about flan in the face.  It leaves the album on a somewhat pondering note, not quite resting the listener at peace like \\"The Tourist\\" did on OK Computer.  <BR>     This is one of the first records in a LONG time that has been highly anticipated and has lived up to the hype.  Also, it's refreshing to see that \\"early to mid-90's\\" bands like Radiohead, as well as bands such as Pearl Jam and REM, are still making music that defies the world's expectations of how good a band can be and how good music should sound.  This is a chapter in the chronicle of a band that has grown more and more with each album they make, outdoing both themselves, their fans, and all of our CD players.  Get this record as soon as possible.  Save yourself from nu-metal and emo pop punk before it's too late.
B00005JKN9|1.0|I HATED this movie!  It starts with brutality, extreme violence, bloodshed and plays that theme over and over again throughout the movie.  The killing is drawn out and overemphasized. The costuming for the first scene was also outrageously stylized and inauthentic with too many people wearing them. Nudity and sex is also overdone.  Breasts all over the place, triage, women hanging on men over and over again.  Too much of everything, except story.  The only two positive things I can comment about this movie is that Daniel Day-Lewis put in a wonderful performance as \\"The Butcher\\" and that I learned that Five Points was abysmally poor, a violent and iniquitous place.  I suspect this movie does not fully represent all the population.  There had to be poor immigrants who were desperately trying to live honest lives and had some sense of decency.  I suspect this movie wants to emphasize the violence and corruption, which it does to overplay.
B00004R9A4|4.0|I remembered this from several years ago, when I decided to purchase the DVD. I always loved it(especially Miss Price. To me she was a strong character, and it's probably due to the fact that she was portrayed by the exquisite Angela Lansbury...no one can top her.) It gave me chills when I was little!<BR> The songs are catchy, and everytime I watch it(which, is usually every other day), I walk around singing \\"Substitutiary Locomotion\\" \\"Beautiful Briny Sea\\" and \\"Eglantine!\\" The tunes spread to everyone in the house!<BR> It's hard to say what my favorite part of this DVD is, but I really do enjoy the \\"Music Magic\\" documentary with the Sherman brothers (as well as comments from the glorious Ms. Lansbury). It had been so long since the last time I watched it, I didn't really notice what was new and what was there before. Being a music lover of sorts, I also immensely enjoyed what footage they found of Angela Lansbury's song, \\"A Step in the Right Direction!\\"<BR> The ONLY thing that took my rating down, was the dubbed voices. It would've been okay if it had been one of two lines, but, at one point...there was almost a whole scene with a totally fake, dubbed \\"David Tomlinson\\" voice, which sounds nothing like him--and he's not the only one that been dubbed. Oh, no...Charles, the 11-going-on-12-year old boy...at one point sounded like a four year old!<BR> However, it IS a splendid movie to watch, and it's easily enjoyable!
B00005JKZV|5.0|Hi,<br />I have read all the books of The Lord Of The Rings, and I must say that this movie gives you an incredible look in the world of Middle Earth. I believe that this movie is the best movie I have ever seen. Great actors, nice effects. To keep it short, this movie has everything that a LOTR fan wants! I you ever duobted i you should see the movie, just go and see it. Before seeing this movie it is good to see The Fellowship of The Ring first.<br />A great fan of LOTR waiting for the 3th part,<br />Sincerly Fat Tony
B00008OWZC|5.0|Dude, What??? This band(Led Zeppelin)is one of the most influental bands of all times! Haven't heard to many successfull bands quote Duran, Duran as one of the most important bands ever. You better re-think your comments. This music is great! Bonham kicks serious butt on this album. That's all I can say, he was the best drummer ever!! Buy this album! I have to go now, I have to go listen to my Wham album! Amateurs!
B000005RFI|5.0|Black Sabbath are often dismissed as being unintelligent schlock music. Ignore anyone who tells you that. The simple truth is that if you only count their first 6 albums (post sabotage there are few redeeming moments) they were simply the finest band of their era. Kicking off with War Pigs, which surely must be counted as one of the top 5 opening tracks of all time, Paranoid is a tour deforce of brutal riffs, thundering drums, and dark but meaningful lyrics pefectly eschewed by Ozzy's ghostly wail. Paranoid the title track is perhaps the single most potent 2:40 ever recorded. People seem to forgett that these lads from Birmingham were from among the most poverty stricken backgrounds in England (Birmingham itself is perhaps the worst city in England, if you ever go there you'll understand where the imagery of desolation and oppression came from). These lads knew what it was like to be down, as opposed to say punks like the Clash (Strummer was the son of a British diplomat, Jones and Simonon both attended university, which no member of Sabbath could have ever hoped to do growing up). And as for claims of being overly proggish and bloat this album (and all of the first 6 clock in around the 40 minute mark) which is shorter the the supposedly revolutionary stripped down punk of the Sex Pistols. More over Sabbath demonstrated they were not simply a blues band with distorted lound guitars. Planet Caravel is one of the finest folk songs ever, ethereal, melancholy, and more over beautiful. Iron Man provides perhaps the most perfect riff of all time, while telling the thinly veiled story of Butlers experience of rejection from the establishment the created him. And just to prove their diversity Fairies Wear Boots is a dark humour song about the bands over indulgence in narcotics. Really what more could you ask for?
B00004VXF2|5.0|\\"Metal Machine Music\\" is probably Lou Reed's most talked-about and legendary album. It's legendary because of the story behind it. This is Lou Reed giving his musical middle finger to his record label, his management and the entire music business in general. It's absolutely hilarious, annoying and entertaining all at the same time.<br />The album consists of nothing but endless drones and shreiks of guitar feedback piled on top of each other. AND it goes on for 64-minutes straight. The music doesn't get any quieter or louder as it goes on. It slams you in the face right at the beginning and stays there for its entire duration. Believe it or not, this album can serve as some excellent background music when played at a lower volume. When played at a higher volume, it's an excellent tool for getting that certain person you can't stand to leave the room instantly. It also serves as THE perfect substitute for alcohol and drugs when you're depressed. I know this from experience. I played my original LP of \\"Metal Machine Music\\" daily in the months that followed my Mom's passing. Trust me, it works!!<br />The newly remastered version of this album includes the original artwork and liner notes plus an excellent historical essay which gives the full details on how this album came to be. Even if you don't like the music, it's worth buying for the essay.<br />\\"Metal Machine Music\\" has also gained noteriety for being possibly the first 'industrial music' album. Many artists in the industrial and harder-techno field have cited this album as an influence. Like it or not, \\"Metal Machine Music\\" was ahead of its time and despite the effort behind it, has turned into a major work-of-art.
B00008J4P5|2.0|Why the White Stripes would take the very qualities that made them unique and exciting and kill the goose that laid the golden egg is beyond me, but they've surely gone and done it with this disappointing release. \\"De Stijl\\" and \\"White Blood Cells\\" rocked with simple and direct appeal - I loved their raw, uncluttered, straightforward presentation, and although neither Jack nor Meg are accomplished musicians, they at least seemed to have the sense to play within themselves, and did what they did very well indeed.<br />  Until now, that is. So, now they've got a bass player? hmmm. In and of itself, that could be worked with, and perhaps even cause their sound to mature. BUT there are some serious flaws lurking here. Listening to Jack trying to tackle a Burt Bacharach classic makes me think of Eric Cartman trying to sing opera. Also, their previously-unpretentious presentation is now gone, replaced by studio sheen and goofy tricks. And while I could forgive Meg for not being the most, um, interesting drummer out there, her attempt at singing just leaves an awful aftertaste. Couple that with less-interesting and less-catchy material, and this metaphor-mixing \\"elephant\\" lays a decidedly NON-golden egg. I guess this is where I get off the bus.
0688163173|4.0|This is an unusual story, and well worth your time.  LeHane is a master of building suspense, and keeping the reader hooked. That's all you can ask of someone in this genre.

B000092ZYX|5.0|...that hasn't already been said?<br />there is no other band in the world that makes music this epic, this despondent, this erudite, this raging, this nervous, this eerie, this fully realized, this eminently satisfying. HTTT is a stunning, draining listen from start to finish.<br />for evidence, try the queasy accusations in &quot;a punchup at a wedding,&quot; the breathless, ominous &quot;a wolf at the door,&quot; thom's defiant tone in &quot;go to sleep,&quot; the lurching &quot;myxomatosis,&quot; the howling denouement to &quot;there there,&quot; the sinuous groove of &quot;where i end and you begin,&quot; or the skittering, hypnotic outro to &quot;sit down. stand up.&quot; and that's just the beginning.<br />it's high time the radiohead obsession began anew. HTTT, like its four immediate predecessors, will no doubt be pored over for decades--and is definitely one for the ages. cheers.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I've been waiting for this for years.  I've been stuck with the version of the Beatles anthology that I taped off the TV.  I couldn't bring myself to fork over [the money] for the VHS set.  Now it's on DVD, much more reasonably priced and well worth the money.  It's a brilliant documentary and there is more footage than was shown when the show ran on the television.  It might be a little too much information for casual fans but for diehards like me it's fantastic.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Este disco de Beck muestra esa faceta que todos algun dia tendremos en nuestras vidas, un album el cual esta lleno de ricos sonidos y que atraen a la melancolia extrema. The Golden Age tiene un sonido puro y refrescante para la memoria que esta exahusta de tanta basura musical que esta rondando por el planeta. la mejor de todas es Lost Cause una cancin facil para decirle a un amor que siempre ha estado perdido que no vuelva si es que algun dia estuvo. Buen punto el que este artista al lado de un buen productor (Nigel Godrich) hacen para alegrar las almas tristes que hay en este desesperado mundo.
B000000W9Z|5.0|I've always been intrigued by David Bowie's music without ever investigating his back-catalogue. The greatest hits packages were where I thought Bowie ruled.     Recently, however, I've started buying his albums and I can't believe the quality of Bowie's music. The reason I feel compelled to write about 'Outside' is that this was the first album I can remember being released with any significance since the mid-80's. I remember not being very impressed with the singles \\"Heart's Filthy Lesson\\" (not included on the 'Se7en' soundtrack) and \\"Hallo Spaceboy\\", so I dismissed this CD.    How wrong I was! 'Outside' is one of Bowie's best albums.    'Outside' is a concept album based on an investigation by Bowie's alter-ego PI Nathan Adler and is one of the most tremendous and audacious undertakings in rock history. It combines different styles of music including predominantly the 'industrial' sound which was made popular at the time by NIN (I recall Bowie even toured the US with Trent Reznor). The tracks flow together brilliantly with various segues performed by Bowie, resulting in much more than just a collection of songs. The stand-out tracks include mellow and melodic \\"I'm Deranged\\" (the opening track to David Lynch's film 'The Lost Highway') and the catchy \\"I Have Not Been to Oxford Town\\" (heard in the film 'Starship Troopers') - demonstrating how impressionable this album was and still is. I wouldn't be suprised to find alot of people having heard these songs and not attributing them to this album or perhaps even to David Bowie. Other stand-out tracks include the most typical Bowie tune \\"Strangers When We Meet\\" and the dark and smooth \\"No Control\\".     But, if you do treat this album as only a series of songs, then you will miss out, as there have not been many concept albums of this quality. Use the production skills of Brian Eno (yes! Eno is back on deck) and the song writing flexibility of David Bowie to enjoy one of rock's best collaborations. You will not be disappointed if you are a true lover of Bowie's music or one who enjoys quality work.
0694003611|5.0|As a former elementary school teacher, I knew all of the popular books out there.  This one, however, slipped by me until I received it as a gift for my baby shower.  I proudly displayed it among all of my daughter's books and didn't think much of it the first time I read it.  I knew it was a classic, but I didn't see what was so exciting until my 12 month old began to request it be read each and every night.  At 18 months we are still reading it every night...only she helps out by reading several words!  We have memorized the book by now and know that it will forever be one of our favorites.  We love it so much that we give it to everyone we know who is having a baby.  This is a definite must have for any child's collection.

1587990717|2.0|To steal one of the author's illustrations, if you give a 1000 monkeys a 1000 years on a 1000 typewriters, they're likely to type out a better written book than this by mere chance.  The egotistical author (Nassim Taleb) is very long-winded and spends the vast majority of the book boasting of his extensive worldly knowledge and his close personal relationships with highly influential people.  When it comes down to the crux of the author's arguments, however, the examples he uses are written in a way that even a third grader could comprehend.  That would be great if this were a children's book, but for the audience he is trying to address, the book comes across as nothing more than a bunch of fluff that completely fails to address (at least with any stastical rigor) the very statistical abberations he presumably set out to explain.  He makes a few worthwhile points (e.g., highly unlikely events are systematically mispriced by the market) but does not bother to back up any of his assertions with evidence (only anecdotal parables).  Moreover, if you have done any reading at all on the subjects of behavioral finance and risk management, you will find the book contains little you haven't already read elsewhere.<br />If you are looking for a light read that weaves philosophy, physics, literature, etc. with investing (Taleb seemed to be trying to do just this), try \\"Latticework: The New Investing\\" by Robert Hagstrom; it is far and away a much better use of your time.  Likewise, it its a reversion to the mean / efficient market type of reading you're after, \\"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\\" by Burton Malkiel is far and away a better choice than the FBR title.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|I love this Film! It contains eight Dreams, Sunshine Through the Rain, The Peach Orchard, The Blizzard, The Tunnel, Crows, Mount Fuji in Red, The Weeping Demon and Village of the Watermills. Every Dream is unique, beautifull and Breathtaking. <br />The Dreams shows us how destructive humans are towards the nature and ourselves. Kurosawa criticizes the past, the presence and the future.<br />Kurosawa (not the real kurosawa) plays in every Dream, from when he was a child in Sunshine through the Rain to when he is old and visits the Village of the Watermills.<br />All in all This is the best film ever and my personal favorite Kurosawa film. Its Beauty is so splendid and I loved every single Dream. I encourage everyone in the world to watch this film. The Masters Masterpiece

0780018664|5.0|All the reviews I've read here are so good that all I can add is the image of the balloon floating in the air.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This album is excellent, a great listen all the way through, and radiohead proves that they reign supreme amongst the rest of the mainstream world, in their own subtle ways. Thom Yorke's voice and the entire band's amazing chemistry proves to make them one of the best bands in the last 25 years.<br />1. 2+2=5: I didn't know if this album could get any better after I heard this song. The constant change in flow, the guitars, the quick and heavy, yet catchy chords thrown in between, Thom's screaming and desperation, all adds up to an excellent song. Rating: 5<br />2. Sit Down. Stand up.: A mellow beat which picks up its tune as you listen along, with outstanding piano that Radiohead picks up from previous masterpieces such as the Pyramid Song and the rendition of Like Spinning Plates. Rating: 5<br />3. Sail to the Moon: Johnny's guitar never cease to astound me. He introduces the song with some amazing rhythm, and the vocals and piano are done in complete tune with each other. An excellent song that'll make you forget a long day's work and sing along with it. Rating: 5<br />4. Backdrifts: Revives old Radiohead methods, with its quick complications making this song another classic mesmorizer. Rating: 5<br />5. Go To Sleep: The gentle strumming of a guitar becomes furious scratches as this one progresses. The bass becomes a great compliment, and the slow drums accompany the song very well. Rating: 5<br />6. Where I End and You Begin - Thom sings \\"Dinosaurs that roam the Earth\\" reviving Optimistic beats and rhythms that we loved in the Kid A smash. Frustrations take over, and Thom talks about eating you alive. Leaves you curious at the end. Rating: 5<br />7. We Such Young Blood: Maybe my favorite track off the album, with gorgeous piano and dumbfounding vocals. The vocals in this track are astounding, and make you want to listen to it again and again. The simple \\"Ooooooooohs\\" during the chorus make it a work of art by its lonesome. Melodic clapping grabs you by the tongue and pull you along with it. Rating: 5<br />8. The Gloaming: The small echoes venture throughout this song, alarming you that your alarm bells should be ringing, over and over again. Behind that sounds like a boiling, throwing various thoughts into your mind. Rating: 5<br />9. There There: What will be a smash hit of a single, There There is introduced by pounding of the drums followed by a few notes of the guitar. The ending for this song is the best part in my opinion, with Thom telling the world \\"We are all accidents waiting to happen.\\" Rating: 5<br />10. I Will - A song that reminds me of the Jews and the holocaust, another song where the vocals make it. Apparently it's a backwards version of Like Spinning Plates, and we're lucky to have it on the album. \\"Little babies eyes\\" being repeated over and over again in its conclusion makes you grateful we live in this world, not matter what's going on. Rating: 5<br />11. A Punchup at the Wedding: A combination of sounds enter this song, including what sounds like a marching band. Another good song, however, one of the lesser songs on the album. Still, an excellent song. Rating: 5<br />12. Myxamatosis - A static song with a funky beat and symbol clashing leading you onto a journey along with it. Thom changes his voice completely to go with the low beat of the song, and eerie melodies during his silence makes this a song worth listening to. Rating: 5<br />13. Scatterbrain: One of the highlights of this album, the guitar is beautiful. Once I heard this song I had to learn it on my guitar, whenever you're looking for the most beautiful guitar notes you'll ever hear, you can always turn to Radiohead. Rating: 5<br />14. A Wolf at the Door: A great way to end the album, with Thom's constant rambling all coming together, fearing the wolf at the door and his constant threats. Making another song a keeper, and slow melodic notes transforming to quick beats make it a perfect way to end an album that has everything in it. Rating:5<br />This is an album you must purchase, you will not regret it. It's been said before, but all hail to the thief.
B00008YLV2|5.0|This is the version that should have been released in the first place!
B000092ZYX|5.0|My first taste of Radiohead was Amnesiac, probably their least accessible, yet fun to listen to in certain moods. Since then I acquired OK Computer and Kid A...Both excellent records, and yet pretty different from each other while Kid A began their period of experimentation with the beats, bleeps, and psychadelia of electronic music, OK Computer was a brilliant example of imaginative progressive rock and great songwriting. After Amnesiac, I found myself wondering, who will Radiohead be now? The anthemic prog rockers of OK Computer, or the avant-garde electronic soundscaping of Amnesiac?...Hail to the Thief answers this question by boldly asserting that Radiohead is both. An amazing merging of the two different sounds, and yet a unique group of well crafted songs in their own right, Hail to the Thief is Radiohead's best, and probably the best album to come out so far this century. No matter which Radiohead sound you prefer, I highly recommend you buy this CD (unless you think that Amnesiac was the perfect Radiohead record and that they should move ahead only in that direction)...other bands I like are Tool, Pink Floyd, Collide, Led Zepelin, System of A Down, Aphex Twin, The Doors, Linkin Park, and Crystal Method...just so you know where i'm coming from.
0385504209|5.0|This is in the same vein as \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" but without Pynchon's sought-after style. Nevertheless, \\"The da Vinci Code\\" delivers a page-turning, mind-churning bonanza. Brown's passion for detail is admirable, but his research is less than superior. Nevertheless, one delves not only into a captivating adventure but also an intellectual spree. The connections between different information a la any mystery novel is especially eye-raising and interesting. Albeit the denoument is somewhat lacking, the rest of the action definitely makes up for it. Hence the 5 stars...
0930289234|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said in the last 15+ years about this? As a bit of background, this book was originally going to feature the Charlton Comics Company heroes (Blue Beetle, The Question, Captain Atom) but when DC Comics bought the rights to these characters, they decided that they really didn't want Alan Moore to tinker with and kill them off. So if you are familiar with those characters, it's easy to connect the dots to \\"who's who\\" in middle age here.<br />  In both the panels and the normal text interludes, Moore \\"re-imagines\\" how costumed vigilantes would have behaved and how the world would react to them. It's refreshing and startling that this really hadn't been done to a great degree before. Unlike most of the \\"grim and gritty\\" writing of the mid-to-late 80's this book stands up to (nearly requires) repeat readings over time. In risk of saying too much, if you don't already have it, PLEASE do yourself a favor and buy it if you love or used to love comics.
B00008BXJF|5.0|After the muddy TCOL a lot of the long time Crimheads were left wondering if the best musical adventures were behind Fripp &amp; Co. I am here to say- absolutely not! Trey Gunn steps up to the plate and belts it out of the park. The Warr guitar sounds sinister and Pat's drumming makes all the folks who yearned for a Bruford return to put that idea on the backburner. Fripp and Belew interlock guitar harmonies and soundscapes better than any duo out there. Belew comes up with some hilariously biting lyrics at the music industry but yet also has some very serious contributions as well. I have heard some say this is the best since Thrak or Discipline. I will just state that this is a monster Crimson release and should be in your collection. Rumor has it this will be their final release as Mr. Fripp is retiring. I only hope that we will get some live releases from this last tour because these four guys are playing better than they ever have. As great as the double trio was, this lineup, right now in 2003, might be stronger!
B00006L83N|5.0|Don't hesitate on buying this!!! This is my favourite Symphony X album, as is their heaviest, as is their least noe-classical. They have basicly dropped there whole neo-classical/power metal previously heard by Symphony X. With the Odessey thay have contrasted the more symphonic, epic, conceptual \\"V\\" (which is still amazing)<BR>The vocals of Russell Allan is harsher than ever. His agressive \\"snarls\\" are to die for. But is still melodic enogh to cry for. His versitilty and range is wider than ever. Probably my fav' metal singer. The guitar playing by Mike Romeo is another thing. He has escaped his more neo-classical playing (harmonic minor/phrigian dominant ect...) with more tastful and mature playing. But doses out with mind-blowing shreddage. this album has some of the coolest riffs aswell. Mike pinnela is unfortunately more in the background in this release. This is to make it that headbanging sound. But his soling is better than ever with his tone, phrasing and licks. The drums of Jason Rullo are great also. He knows when to lay bank and go with the groove and when to go technical. Bass player Mike Lepond (the 3rd Mike) is often with not-to-not synchopation with the riffery of Romeo. A band of fully accomplished musicians...<br />Heres a track by track review.<BR>INFERNO: One of my favourite heavy songs by SyX. This has the heaviest riffery by Romeo and harshest vocals by Allan. A headbangin', shred-fest. the riff is one of the best riffs ever.<BR>WICKED: The opening riff is mega-cool. A highlight vocal performance by Allan. A melodic chorus and intricate arrangments. Great lyrics about a traveller meeting a seductive woman with twists.<BR>INCANTATIONS OF THE APPRENTICE: WOAHHH!!!the inro is crazy!!! but unfortunately pulled down by the stop-start verse. If I would have to pick the weakest song on the album, it would probably be this one. But kick-ass never the less.<BR>ACCOLADE II: Inner beauty! one of the softest songs on the album.The sequel to the accolade onthe Devine Wings.. CD. A total masterpeice. The melodies are just devine. Masterpeice. the solo by Romeo is his most mature, emotional, well...perfect solo's he's done.<BR>KING OF TERRORS: the beauty of Accolade II is made up for in this one with the heavyness. This (along with Inferno) is probably the heaviest songs in the SyX catalog. The riff is repeated alot but manages to be intriging and interesting the whole way. The synchopation between the rhythm guitars, lead guitars and keyboards and drums in the solo section screams \\"PROOOG!!\\"<BR>THE TURNING: probably the most underated Sy-X songs out there. It has all the classic SyX elements. But not any stand out elements apart from the amazing solo. Probably the best guitar/keyboard interplay (NOT dual) EVER!!! Shred-head's heads wil blow off alfter hearing this.<BR>AWAKENINGS: The opening piano lines with Russ's \\"crying\\" voacals is beautiful before going into the more progressive song on the album. This is probably my fav' song on the album (other than the epic) Pinnela shines in this song, in the middle section he showes his jazz-knowledge! \\"Hahahah\\" you say, \\"Why the hell would a heavy prog-band do JAZZ??!?! It's a parody\\" Well let me tell you, it fits! it just adds beauty, emotion and brilliance to this song. There is also Romeo's flying shred runs all over. MASTERPEICE!<BR>THE ODESSEY: !!!!!!!! This is the 24-minute epic. i pefure this over the epic \\"Devine Wings'....\\". Romeo has some of his best moments in this. The opening orchestration showes he's way more than a \\"shredder\\". I won't even start to review this song as it has so many elements and perspectives to say. One of my favourite songs ever. After you take the time to listen to this you come out of the opus saying \\"WOAH!\\". Better than \\"A change of Seasons\\" for all you DT fans. But then again, thats in my opinion only.<br />Don't be put off by the heaviness if you don't normally like the headbanging aspect of prog. This album is a true masterpeice. It hasalot more elements than the heaviness of this. I think this is a good place to start for a newbie (along with \\"V\\"). So .... what are you doing - wasting your time to read this review! just get up off your arse and BUY it!
B00005AQF7|5.0|This CD is like the sequel to Dre's Chronic, which is my all-time favorite CD.  This is a MUST BUY if you like Chronic as it has the same subject matter with Dre's master beats only this time with Snoop rapping mostly.  GREAT CD.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is by far the best album I have ever heard! There is not one song on it that I don't like! If you don't already know, this is Tool's third album and their best album in their musical career. Maynard James Keenan is probably the best songwriter in our time talking about loss of feelings and emotions in the song \\"Stinkfist\\", talking about how he sees and feels about Los Angeles(listen to the lyrics to understand) in the song \\"Aenema\\",and talking about how he feels about being called a sellout by a fan in the song \\"Hooker with a Penis.\\"<BR>The best song on the album is the song \\"Third Eye\\", which is at least thirteen minutes long. The song is so good that you don't even know that thirteen minutes go by! Tool certainly has a dark sense of humor which is displayed on the track \\"Dier Eier von Satan\\", which is a cookie recipe read in german. Adam Jones' guitar playing is excellent, especially on this album. I have never heard this kind of guitar playing by a rock band like this. He knows how to twist and distort what you hear being played. If you don't have this album, then do yourself a favor and go buy this album! I promise you will not be disappointed.
B000094DUP|5.0|Delta Goodrem is no ordinary singer...she can play the piano, sing, write songs and even act in shows.<BR>She started piano lessons at 8 years of age and began writing songs when she was 12. She hails from Australia where previous stars like Kylie Minogue & Holly Valance are groomed.<br />She's different from her fellow predecessors Kylie & Holly<BR>in that she already was an accomplished singer before she was asked to act in Neighbours, Australia's popular soap drama. She is a talented 18 year old individual and an inspiration to many. She has a wonderful personality! You don't need to strip half-naked to gain success. Her debut album says it all...great songs with meaningful lyrics. 2 songs already have topped the charts for many weeks namely Born To Try and Lost Without You. On the way is also Innocent Eyes that is making it's way to the top too!<br />Once you place the CD in the player, you won't want to stop it...all songs are just right for each other in the album. Songs like Butterfly, Predicatable, Not Me Not I, Running Away, Longer, In My Own Time, This Is Not Me, My Big Mistake are great too!<br />This album is a sure-get!! Delta is the next, big rising star!
1559408855|4.0|I am into subject matter of this kind and I never heard of this film until I found out about it on the internet. When I finally watched it, I realized that it is not that bad. This is a abstract piece of art that I found to be visually interesting. The director certainly did have the guts to release this to the public and most likely got killed because of it(the director was killed after the release of this film). The plot is that four men of power in 1944 fascist Italy kidnap a group of boys and girls and expose them to a lifestyle that involves sadism and control. They had no freedoms and no say in what they were forced to do. One segment had the group being forced to eat human excrement as part of a sexual experience that was explained to them. In the end, anyone who was rebellious or disobedient in any way were punished by torture and death. This film shows how much power religious and political leaders have. They did it for their own amusement and satisfaction. The torture scenes are not for the weak-stomached. They are pretty graphic, although I think they could have been alot worse than it was. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU GET OFFENDED EASILY!!!! You will not make it through the first half of the film because not only are there torture scenes; there are also scenes of homosexuality and sex fetishes. I recommend this film to anyone who likes films with artistic integrity and a political message, which is that fascism is wrong and that moral redemption is nothing but a myth. People have to realize that stuff like this does and has happened before. Whether it happens in prisons or in a torture chamber, people are exposed to this in real life. This film shows it in an extreme way. 4 stars.
0393057658|3.0|Moneyball was a good read in many aspects. It was interesting to get a insight of how a baseball GM works. The best part of the book was reading about how the front office processed who they should choose in the among all of those eligible in the draft and the scouting of reliever Chad Bradford and the signing of Scott Hatteberg. You got a sense that Beane and the A's always had constraints concerning player transactions, and they had to be careful with every move because there is not any disposable money to throw around. <br />Moneyball also had brief passages describing several baseball theorists, that Oakland uses when looking at potential ballplayers. It gave you something to think about, if you are a big baseball fan.<BR>However, I thought the book lacked in a certain area. It never talked about any of Billy Beane's &quot;mistakes&quot;. There had to be at least one move that backfired on him! Moneyball almost made it seem like these theories are bulletproof. Yes, they work in baseball, but it made it seem that if you subscribed to these scouting techniques, everything WILL work for you.<BR>That being said, I still enjoyed Moneyball. It actually gave me something to think about when I watch baseball.
B000094J5T|4.0|Early on in this film, I thought to myself: \\"Just another holocaust film. So what?\\" I'd seen and read it all, from the enslavement of the Jews (and their initial inability to cope with the reality of what was happening all around them) to the liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto. It bothered me a little that I wasn't seeing anything new. But then again, I reminded myself, this wasn't fantasy-- this was history.<br />However, by the end of the film, I realized that this film does come up with something essential.<br />The key to this movie is the utter helplessness and claustrophobia of its protagonist. Mr. Szpilman struggles to obtain a work card for his elderly father, only to watch his family packed onto the train bound for Treblinka anyway. He's only saved by dumb luck-- a Jewish collaborator grabs him and throws him behind police lines, enabling him to get away. Why? Apparently because of his musical talent; the one thing that seperates him from the rest of the victims, and also something he had no control over.<br />Following his escape, the protagonist moves from refuge to refuge, and barely manages to elude the Gestapo. He gets sick, grows a beard, and eventually degenerates to the point where he's barely recognizable. In the end he wanders hopelessly through the burned remains of the ghetto, where he runs across something rare indeed: a Nazi commander with a heart of gold, who spares him-- once again-- because of his musical talent. Later, this officer is killed by the Russians, in spite of his courageous actions.<br />The moral of this story?<br />None, unless it's that no good deed goes unpunished, and that our actions have no relationship whatsoever to our destinies. But why should this film has a moral? Real life doesn't concern itself with messages; it is what it is. Ultimately this film is a brooding, ironic tale of a man who's forced to watch through one window or another as the world destroys itself. In the end, he survives by pure accident-- and perhapsthat in itself is the message both of this film, and of the holocaust.
B000002V0Q|5.0|NO ONE mentions this song! NO ONE!  In all the reviews, no one talks about the greatness that is this song!  It's my favorite megadeth song of all time, and that's saying a lot because they have so many great songs.  This cd came off of their thrash metal period and they did supringly well.   Although Youthanasia is my favorite non-thrash megadeth album this one is almost as good.  Architecture Of Aggression, Countdown to extinction, ashes in your mouth, and captive honour are worth the price of this album alone and for what amazon is selling it for, i suggest you click that buy button right now!  11 tracks of heavy frickin metal.
B00008CLOA|1.0|A great album never dies, but this is not one! Let's stop wasting our time, shall we?
B000002UAC|4.0|This album showed us a couple of things -- that the Beatles could come up with first-rate ORIGINAL material -- and that they could do cover versions of other people's stuff that were better than the original.   George Harrison lets loose on Chuck Berry's &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; so convincingly that some people today think he wrote it, while John Lennon's larynx-shredding delivery of &quot;Money&quot; is almost as powerful as his work on &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; was on the band's previous album.   John shows his other side on Smokey Robinson's &quot;You Really Got a Hold On Me&quot; -- a spellbinding performance that shows how gifted a vocalist Lennon was.  Paul McCartney locked up his &quot;balladeer&quot; credentials on &quot;Til There Was You&quot;, and the track was further bolstered by George's melodic acoustic solo.  And the band does such a great job on &quot;Please Mr Postman&quot; that, as far as I'm concerned, this is a Beatles song -- no matter that somebody else wrote it!  As for the originals, the best is Paul's &quot;All My Loving&quot;.  No wonder the Beatles opened with this number when they conquered America on The Ed Sullivan Show. George's C&amp;W solo has often been praised (and rightly so) on this song, but for me, what really moves it along is Lennon's double-timed rhythm.  It's hard to imagine &quot;All My Loving&quot; without it.  George's debut composition is also excellent.  I've never understood why, in later years, he refered to &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot; as &quot;crummy&quot;.  I think it's one of his best ever songs -- and the band really hits a groove on it.  Just a personal note here:  this was the first Beatles album I ever heard -- released in Canada as &quot;Beatlemania! With the Beatles&quot;.  My older sisters bought it when I was just a 6-year-old kid, and I fell in love with the band that night.   And I remain a fan to this day!   I challenge today's 6-year-olds to still be fans of whatever they are listening to now,in the year 2043!
B000092ZYY|5.0|Okay... so i've had this cd for about 6 weeks now (yeah yeah yeah... so i caved and downloaded it.. i couldn't wait, okay??)  Anyways... I had listened to it a couple times, and my first impression of it was pretty much... \\"huh?\\"    It just felt, weird.  Nothing stood out to me... the songs just felt messy, the album didn't seem to have any coherent tone, the lyrics made no sense, and didn't strike any chords inside of me.  It was like the music was just going in one ear and out the other.  <br />But... like any good Radiohead fan knows... I realized it would take several listens to get into the album. (Amnesiac being by far the most difficult to 'like', it took me about 20 listens, although it was immediately intriguing.)  So i hadn't touched 'Hail to the Theif' in about a month, but after reading the reviews of it now that it has been released, i decided to give it another listen.  I put on the headphones, turned off the lights, and let the cd do its work.  WOW.<br />Now...i don't know if its a 'Masterpiece' on the level of 'The Bends' and 'OK Computer'... but it is an amazing piece of work.  The album is filled with gorgeous piano melodies, amazing production, and interesting electronic effects (that add to the songs, never distract).  Radiohead's songwriting is still top-notch... there are many stand-out tracks:  2 + 2 = 5, Sail to the Moon, There There, Myxamatosis, The Gloaming (for its sheer wierdness)  as well as some not so great ones- We Suck Young Blood (not a huge fan of this one yet).  But its actually the songs that i had completely forgotten about that stood out the most this time:  i love 'Scatterbrain' 'Punch-up at a wedding' and the closing track 'Wolf at the Door'... all amazing.<br />I still feel that this cd is kind of a mess- but in a good way.  Some of the jumps between tracks are huge changes in tone, which can be jarring.. but the songs are all great.  The cd is definitely a must have for fans... even if you weren't impressed by the Kid A /Amnesiac period.  For fans that have trouble getting into it... just let it take over you, don't try too hard to 'get it'... it'll come to you.   :)
0380002930|5.0|i read this book when i first started my second semester english class because it was lying around and i couldnt find another book to read, but now, im glad i did read it. its a wonderful book, full of adventure of thrill.. it really left me on the edge of my seat, wanting to know what was going to happen next with Hazel and his friends, and the dictionary in the back is fun to look at when u dont know what one of the authors words mean. Best of all, kids of all ages can relate to the book, and even if your not a kid, its still a good book to read in your spare time. i reccomend this book to people who have nothing better to do.. enjoy a good story once in a while.. even if it is about a fantasy world of rabbits and their society.. although i did get wrapped up in the book, because the author uses imagery strongly, leaving you with an almost movie like version of the book playing in your head.. buy this book.. not becuase you can, but becuase i said so...
B000092ZYX|5.0|How do they do it?!<BR>Hail To The Thief is a real masterpiece!<br />Radiohead are an oasis in the middle of the musical desert we've been living in.<br />I only had time to listen to the new album a couple of times, but god!, it feels good! The last song, &quot;A Wolf At The Door&quot;, really scared me! And I got the Special Edition... I spent two hours just looking at the cover!<br />This has nothing to do with the old OK Computer (don't get me wrong, i consider it the best album of the 90's) or Kid A (astonishing!). It's more like an evolution from Amnesiac (I almost died listening to some of the songs in this one!).<br />Hail To The Thief is beautiful! I can't find the words to describe it. And I think I'll be descovering it for the next few months...<br />wow!...<br />* * * * * * * * * * - My rating is ten stars out of five.
B00000I07P|5.0|I was very pleased with this Bon Jovi CD... no complaints here!
B0000027RL|5.0|This is the first PJ album i got and i really liked it.It has their big hits Alive,Black,Jeremy and Even Flow,but also some other great songs that never got a chance to hit radio stations.Once,the first track on the album is superocking and probably my favorite song on the album,Garden is a heart wrenching ballad with great lyrics and guitar and Porch is a hur<BR>ricane,Why Go is excellent to.<BR>pick this up if you like rock!
B00004U2EZ|5.0|I first saw this musical in my French class...we were watching it because we had nothing else to do, and on came Bruno singing &quot;Le Temps des Cathedrales&quot; and I was absoluted mesmerized by this music and the intensity of the words and the dramatic climbs and outstanding beats... after the first song I went out and bought the CD... I would recommend this to anyone who has an appreciation for music...even if you don't know French... I haven't heard the english version yet, but I'm perfectly fine listening the the French, emotions have no language barriers.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a must have DVD.  It has terrific sound and amazing special effects.  If you own a DVD player then this movie should be in your collection.  The story is very compelling and the movie pulls it off nicely with only a few cliches and quirks.  This is not the best movie I have seen (especially in the acting department), but if you look at the intriguing storyline, the action scenes and the great special effects, it adds up to one great DVD.  Buy it today!
B000096I9G|5.0|Ver este DVD es una experiencia cercana al climax de estar frente a frente a uno de los iconos del siglo. La presentacion en vivo esta hecha para impactar visualmente haciendo sobresalir a Robert Smith, no solo en su interpretacion vocal, sino ademas en sus peculiares gestos. Ademas concierto muestra la evolucion de un grupo que supo adaptarse al tiempo, lastima que sea el fin............
B00009V7P8|5.0|Although Damien Rice has been compared to David Gray, the similarities end at &quot;singer-songwriter.&quot; Mr. Rice sings with passion, meaning, and conviction, and is certainly more credible than Mr. Gray, as he weaves tales of love, hurt, and anger, clearly from the bottom of his own tortured heart.<br />The songs are beautifully arranged, and show that when an artist's sole desire is not money, the truth will shine. Do yourself a favor and buy this record.  It may well change your life.
B00005JLR2|4.0|Wonderful movie! Lots of action - great animation - wonderful story!  Adults and kids alike will enjoy this movie.  It caters to kids older than 6 however, the younger ones may not stay as interested as it takes a bit of following to understand it.<br />This is an awesome adaption of the book Treasure Planet! If you even remotely liked the book (and even if you didn't like the book) you should thoroughly enjoy this movie! It is a story of a boy who sets out to find Treasure Planet--and along the way finds much more!<br />The little morph is my favorite!!-he can take the shape of anything and is adoreable!-I want one for myself!! I recommend this movie to all thrill seekers!<br /><br />1smileycat :-)
B000096I9G|5.0|This is the best live release the Cure has ever done, and way up there as concert films go in general.<br />I was in Berlin for both nights of the filming.  Although the DVD could never capture the \\"essense\\" of the cigarrete smoke filled room (gasp!), far more detail is revealed in sound and vision on the DVD.<br />I was very impressed the the filming, particularly some of the side stage shots where Robert, Simon and Perry are all in focus, as well as the editing which really captured the frenetic portions of songs like The Kiss.  Very ocasionally video effects were used, but only on Pornography did I think it was over done.  (Interestingly, although the the huge floor to ceiling projections were integral to the show, the dramatic images are lost since there are very few full stage scenes.)<BR> <BR>The sound was pristine, and for once Jason's drum sound had a powerful punch that I feel has been missing on the least few tours.  My only fault with Trilogy is that the audio is so clean that at times it does not sound \\"live\\".  This opinion is based on the stereo audio track.  Perhaps the 5.1 audio track captures more of the ambience of the venue.
B00005JLEU|5.0|\\"Spirited Away\\" could never be confused with a traditional Disney flick.  After taking a wrong turn on the way to their new house, Chihiro and her parents stumble upon what they believe is a deserted theme park. In a terrifying scene, they are ripped apart  - the parents transformed into obscenely greedy pigs and Chihiro literally fading away. Rescued by Haku, the apprentice to the witch Yubaba, Chihiro soon discovers she is trapped in a bathhouse for spirits and gods.  Many hilarious, other frighteningly evil, these spirits give the bathhouse an eery surreality that Chihiro comes to embrace.<br />Using his considerable talent, Miyazaki has once again created an inspired, stunningly animated film.  Those raised on Disney might find themselves off-balance without the moralistic overtones, but Miyazaki does not create his films for young children.  As with ?Princess Mononoke,? this film is far too intense and complex for those under eight.  Miyazaki's films are about story and visual delights - and ?Spirited Away? is no exception.  His characters are well-defined and multi-dimensional, often charming in an off-beat way.  Chihiro makes an irresistible heroine, and Haku is a magnetic, appropriately mysterious hero.  Even the comedic giant baby (I laugh as I think of him) fills the screen with life.<br />The dubbed version of this movie is actually better than most dubbed versions of Japanese movies, with added lines to help those not familiar with Japanese culture orient themselves. For example, the Sumo-like radish god is named in the English, but not in the subtitled version.  Also in the English, the parents grunt like pigs before they morph, foreshadowing their fate in a way the Japanese language edition does not.  Although I?m a purist and always prefer the original language version, those watching the dubbed will still be rewarded.<br />I highly recommend this film for everyone over eight years old.  Don't confuse animation with simplicity because \\"Spirited Away\\" is anything but two-dimensional.  Treat yourself to this remarkable film.  I doubt you'll regret the entry into Miyazaki's fantastical world.\\" is anything but two-dimensional.  Treat yourself to this remarkable film.

0345350499|5.0|This book was really well written, and was the turning point for my history with fantasy. I have to admit, this was my first real fantasy. It turned me on to female dominant writing, and helped me see into the eyes of &quot;the real&quot; King Arthur. The story told behind the women make it seem way more real, and show that we are always what is behind the making of big things, even if the men can't see it or even some women. Anyway, the book had a really believable story line that matched up with everything else I have learned in history class. My only problem was that I had no idea what to read first and so on. I started with this one, only to find out I should have read a different one first. So, where do I go now, was my main question.
0385504209|2.0|After hearing a friend rave about how complex and interesting this book was, I decided to sit down and read it.  Considering that there are so many great books around with similar concepts, this was pretty much a waste of time.  I would much rather have spent the time rereading Eco's &quot;Name of the Rose&quot; or Wilton Bernhardt's &quot;Gospel,&quot; both of which pull off the religious-mystery concept far, far better than this book.
0446691437|5.0|This is one of the most effective kicks in the rear you'll ever have. It's very self-confronting, and I had to literally set the book down between it's very brief chapters just to sort of catch my breath, and face the truth within myself. It's sort of a creative artist's self-help book with a very masculine, warrior sort of a flavor to it. This book pulls no punches. It can help change your life no matter what you're calling. I hope everyone in the world reads it, and takes it to heart.
B000089RW0|2.0|Again, I was made to sit and watch yet another horror<br />movie. I'm chosing the next one we watch! Alas, here is<br />a story of a ship lost for 40 years that all of a sudden<br />appears in the Bering Sea, just waiting for a salvage crew to<br />get all the goodies on board.<br />  It starts out all sweet and pretty.  Dancing and smiling<br />passangers soon turn into a bloody mess. Come on! Gross me out!<br />Again I got mad at the characters for doing stupid things instead of getting out of there quickly! However, if they had<br />there won't be a movie, but maybe that won't be such a bad thing!<br />Sorry folks, this just wasn't my cup of tea!
6305907439|3.0|It is blasphemy! Steve Morse butchers the songs with his funky off pitch string bending. He has the most horrible vibrato. If no one else notices it they need their ears checked. Steve Morse is left handed but plays righty which is the problem with his vibrato that cannot be ignored. Yngwie Malmsteen would be better fitting in Deep Purple but he is too into himself and his controlling other players to have joined this legendary band.
078322947X|5.0|A forgotten classic - the scenes in the jungle (no CGI here) simply take your breath away - NOT TO BE MISSED!
B0000009TJ|5.0|this is the sister cd to make a jazz noise here.  Both of these cd's are way worth the money.  Lets go over some of the songs:<br />Disc One:<br />1.  Heavy Duty Judy.  what a bunch of shredding by frank.  Totally the most aggressive he has ever played this song.  It is hard to believe he never picked up the guitar before going on this tour.  Frank is deadly on this song.<br />2.  Ring of Fire/Cosmic Debris.  good songs, and Ring Of Fire is worth the price of admission with all the tongue in cheeck giggling going on during this song.<br />3. Find Her Finer/WNTBP are good outings.  Perhaps a bit overdone, but musically good.<br />4.  I left my HISF.  Very good. ODD but good in the way that it is ODD.  I do remember as a kid that my mother liked this song a lot, so it is odd to hear M. Keneally butcher it in a total FZ way.<br />5.  Zomby Wolf.  Great.  I love this song, and this version is worth the money.  Put this song and 'City Of Tiny Lights' from make a jazz noise here together on an MP3 player.  Quite good indeed.<br />6.  Bolero/Zoot Allures.  This is very pleasant.  I really liked the FZ version of Bolero a lot.  Quite good indeed.  I think he did total justice to the song.  ZA is always great.<br />7. Mr Green Jeans - Sofa... these are very passionaltly played, and they could really be a suite.  Sofa is interesting with this band, the fill it up nicely.<br />Disc Two<br />1.  Purple Haze/ Sunshine o Your love.  Funny, dada and total frank.  Ike really shines.<br />2. LMTC.  What a song.  this is really great, and FZ finds another way to shine this up and make it great.<br />3. the rest of the cd, all the way up to STH is jokes and music.  Both intertwined into gags about Jimmy Swaggart.  Now, if you don't like the gag jokes that FZ does from cd to cd, you won't like this.  I like it, but if MAKE A JAZZ NOISE HERE was not released, I would not like this cd as much.  This cd gives you a light hearted look at the musical prowess of the 88 band, but in all reality, MAJNH should have been a 5 cd release including the Broadway the Hard way songs.  Lather2.  ...ty, MAJNH should have been a 5 cd release including the Broadway the Hard way songs.  Lather2.  ...
B00005YUPO|3.0|While my 11 month old daughter has enjoyed many of the offerings from Baby Einstein, this particular DVD has not 'wowed' her as much as some of the others have done.  The music, as usual, is pleasant and enjoyable (I personally am a fan of Bach) and the visual aspects appealing, but she has responded with more enthusiasm to Baby Van Gogh and Baby Mozart, quite honestly.  We will keep this in our library of 'baby friendly' videos, without question, but would probably reach for a more 'tried and true' favorite first before Baby Bach.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|this is a really good cd. i woudl recomend this to almost everyone, its really good,  i especitally lyke the beat to some of the songz.. it really gets you into it. this CD is a definate
B000092Q7O|2.0|This was one of the most disappointing movies I have seen in a long time.  The events that it portrayed are horrible and tragic, but the movie and its presentation of the events were severely lacking considering the awards it was given and the huge budget that it must have taken to make the movie.  There was nothing that has not already been said repeatedly from Hollywood, and the movie spent more time highlighting bloody scenes than any sort of plot line.  I realize that it is unpopular to say that anything portraying the Holocaust is not magnificent, but this movie was tragically lacking in anything like substance or quality.<br />In my opinion, if you've seen ANY other Holocaust movie in the last 10 years, save your money and the 2 1/2 hours for a movie that has something new to say and says it with intelligence.
0060512806|5.0|At first I was daunted by the 900+ page book. Books this size tend to be a chore to read through, ala Infinite Jest. No so for this book. If you live in San Jose and/or are a programmer, this will resonate with you. Stephenson understands our culture. It is also structurally rich, with parallels to the WWII generation. Also, it contains one of the shortest sex scenes in all of literature, outside of Thomas Hardy.
B00008K7AM|4.0|I got dragged to see this movie by one of my good friends who has a thing for Matthew Lawrence (mind you she is 25 years old!) Anyhoo, I made sure to get comfy before the movie because I was prepared to sleep through it. I'm not a big fan of slapstick humor and Rob Schneider is the king of stupid movies. But I was surprised to see this movie is actually very funny! I found myself laughing out loud through most of the movie. I was also pleasantly surprised to see all of the extras on the DVD including an alternate ending. Check this movie out
B00005JLEU|5.0|My 8 and 12 year old are anime fans, but because of their age had rather been limited to Dragon Ball Z (so much anime is R-rated)and needless to say I haven't gotten interested in DBZ. But then we discovered Miyazaki! Spirited Away is even better than Princess Monokoke in my opinion - with a richer storyline and the artwork even more amazing. My kids and I still discuss the movie's themes of overcoming your fears, the power of love, that beauty and/or good can be found within almost anyone, etc. Yes, there are some scary parts (pig parents and No-Face)but I think any kid over 8 would be fine - and some younger (Lord of the Rings is MUCH scarier and certainly more violent). AND, this is absolutely a movie that you will love to watch with your child - in case they are scared, to discuss the sophisticated themes, and HECK just cause its a GREAT movie! I can't wait to see the other Miyazaki movies - oh, and I'm sure my kids are looking forward to it too!!
B00008LDPU|2.0|I saw the Final Flight of the Osiris in the theater and I thought it was great. It had a great story and the animation was awesome. When the DVD came out I ran and bought it. OOPS!!! I started watching it and I loved the animation, they had some of the top Anime artists. The problem was the story lines, some of them just seemed pointless and you were just left saying ummmm ok. This would be a good DVD to rent, but don't buy it!!
B00003CX8N|5.0|She leads a lonely life in NY. He dwells in a silent marriage in a London suburb. She, a self-taught book connoisseur, is intereseted in out-of-print books advertised by his company (Marks & Company Antiquarian Booksellers, 84 Charing Cross Road) in a US newspaper. So she sends for the books.<br />And thus with a quaint common literary interest begins an epistolary addiction for 30 years that weaves a tapestry of mutual admiration and love. Sounds like a somewhat flimsy strand to base a movie on, but this is anything but a maudlin trans-atlantic love story.<br />When he writes of the devastated post-war England, she sends him care packages of ham. He sends precious hardbound editions of Boswell, Chesterton and Cardinal Newman. After many years, he dies. She finally goes to London and visits the now-empty bookstore. A sweet pang of unrequited love.<br />By turns witty and romantic, the letters themselves carry the movie! The times are beautifully captured with the immaculate cinematography (ps: 4 Oscars) and the implied contrast between NY and Britain is quite evident (as it was in the book).<br />For bibliophiles like myself, the very idea of seeing a sauve Hopkins behind his dusty register is reason enough to swoon about this movie. But the film's stunning achivement is in the absolutely platonic love that the two protagonists evoke. Without ever needing to meet they create a microcosm of their own that infuses something special into their lives.<br />A wonderful look at how simple love really has to be. A MUST for your collections.
0385504209|5.0|Through a very ingenious mystery plot, Dan Brown tries to present  the complex roots of modern Christianity.  The book makes one wonder why women were cast out of most modern religions, so it is not the &quot;normal&quot; dogma that we are used to, and may explain some of the more negative &amp; emotional reviews.<br />Contrary to those reviews, this book is NOT an anti-religion tome.  It celebrates and is very respectful of human spirituality, in all its forms.  It tries to explain, in a historical context, how religions came to be what they are today.<br />The end is particularly wonderful, with a final analysis that should leave everyone feeling good about their beliefs, whatever they are.<br />BUT, let me emphasize, The Da Vinci Code it isn't *just* about religion -- it is also a thrilling detective story.  Despite a great opening page, I do agree that the beginning is just a tiny bit slow, but is more than compensated for, later on.<br />It is so well written, that I could not figure out who the &quot;bad guy&quot; was even at the very end!  Dan Brown weaves a twisting and turning plot that finishes elegantly, without lowering itself to explaining a bunch of loose ends, in the final chapter!<br />I can't wait for the movie to come out!
B000067G3C|1.0|This thing was terrible and I thought it couldn't get any worse until I was forced by my wife to watch Speed 2!
B00004T37H|4.0|Princess Mononoke is one of the best animes ive seen in a while.It's very easy to keep up with and understand.It is also a very original anime.About the only bad thing about Princess Mononoke is that,at times,it starts to lose interest,but always ends up regaining interest and then some.Princess Mononoke will have you hooked from beginning to end!!
B000005RXD|4.0|A worthy addition to the KISS collection.  Give it a try, it ROCKS!
B00005JG6R|3.0|Prior to viewing Akira,I had heard only good things about it.Now,keep in mind that I very seldom find an anime I dont like(I have seen hundreds)but,I was very dissapointed by Akira.The storyline is fairly good and completely original,and the graphics are mostly well-done,but I just did not understand(for the most part) where the story was going until almost the end(which is very unusual for me because I usually can understand a story from the first few minutes).But,after watching it a second time,I understood it much better.Although you may have to watch it a few times,Akira is loaded with killer music and a pretty good plot.
B00006GFAB|1.0|Go to the Studio once in a while for Pete's sake.  Did I see someone say &quot;good girl gone bad&quot; should be on a compilation?  That song should even be played again let alone re-released.
B00005JM03|5.0|I am a big fan of the first movie, and I love the ending. I heard about a remake and I knew that they would have to have a different ending this time, but I didn't expect a completely different movie. Wow! Seth Green plays the usual excellent supporting character. The scene with him in the car watching Rob put the moves on the cabin repair woman was bust a gut funny. <br />If you have never seen the original, see it before or after this movie. Never spoils the other.
B000002ITW|4.0|The best thing about the cd is they added more material and the S. Stills' Black Queen, is superb acoustic blues. All the graphics from the lp is included with the cd and all the words to the songs. They'll never be able to duplicate this sound again but there is a throw-back like introducing Neil Young twice on the first disk.All-in all, you'll never hear anything like this again. So pick up a copy today.
B00008LDPU|5.0|The Animatrix is one of the best anime films I've ever seen.  It's nine segments are all intriguing, plunging you further into the world of The Matrix.  The first four segments are based on the story written by the Wachowski brothers, the remaining five are simply random tales from the mythology of The Matrix. <br />FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS - Visually stunning (can we expect anything less from SquareSoft?) and an integral part of The Matrix story...especially if you've played the Enter The Matrix video game.<br />THE SECOND RENAISSANCE PART I AND II - An in-depth look at how machines took over the world.  It's in-your-face violence and depiction adds a huge impact on the story.<br />KID'S STORY - Remember the young kid in Matrix Reloaded that Neo saved?  This is his story.  It's animation style is reminiscent of the film Waking Life and features the voice of Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss.  <br />PROGRAM - A very short piece involving a sparring program.  The animation style is traditional anime.<br />WORLD RECORD - Not my favorite, but still an alright story of a runner who accidentally discovers the matrix while trying to break a world record.  <br />BEYOND - There's a house where the program of the matrix is not entirely stable and some kids enjoy the effects of this glitch.  Very cute story.<br />A DETECTIVE'S STORY - An agent hires a private eye within the matrix to find a hacker called Trinity.  A very dark style.  Also features Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity.<br />MATRICULATED - This is my absolute favorite.  Some rebels try to convince some machines to defect to the human side by jacking them in to a human-generated program.  The visuals in this segment are breathtaking and trippy.  This is from the animators of Aeon Flux.  <br />Overall, a great DVD.  Bad-[rear] soundtrack and better-than-average surround sound.  The picture quality is crystal-clear.  If you have a 16:9 TV or even just component video hooked up this will be a fantastic ride.  Enjoy!
B000002GQG|5.0|I recently bought the mellenium collection--very awesome but it misses on RIDE MY SEE-SAW. So I got this on cd for the first time in years and this cd is awesome. Why they steered away from this format I'll never know but I think they suffered on the remainder of their works. There's no other music like this so the band has stood the test of time. Don't forget to buy this re-mastered work for your collection. Get it now!

What a drag .<BR>The text itself is often meandering .<BR>The author frequently starts off on one point , and then sidetracks into another .<BR>There are very many musical examples given to illustrate the text .... too many IMO .

What I really Like is St. Patrick's Day because of the reference to Christmas. Buy this because I guarantee you will enjoy it and play it again-and-again for his words and and style. Don't have the volumn set high on the 1st song---the first words might crackle in your boxes. 31/2 stars---A nice first effort.
0425152251|4.0|This book does a good job at acquainting the reader with the basic trends of philosophy (even if Nietzsche is briefly mentioned in only one nonsensical paragraph).  The plot -- which is not what I bought the book for in the first place -- is contrived and lame-o for the first 200 pages, and after that just turns bizaare but readable.  Some minor annoyances: the author clearly believes in Jesus, which was a turnoff for me.  Then after several informative pages on Darwin, the author shows a complete misunderstanding of Darwin, by saying first that there \\"obviously\\" must be a creator, since there has been a trend to complexity in life since its primordial beginnings, and then says that the eye's delicate structure is proof of a creator.  The philosophy is what I wanted, though, and philosophy's what I got.
B000088E6D|5.0|I many types of music but always find my way back to the easy listening of Sinatra (that my parents played during my childhood).  This CD is wonderful.  Buble is a talent to be enjoyed by everyone for years to come.  I am anxiously awaiting CD #2.  Also, we saw him in concert last night and he was even better!  Enjoy.
B00005JL96|1.0|Whoever buys this DVD to see the A*Teens Music Video \\"I Can't Help Falling in Love With You\\" will be very disappointed. They don't know how to show the original version of the music video because they only showed bits and pieces of it and that's unfair to everybody who buys the DVD so they can see the music video. I saw the original music video and I thought I was really getting something by adding this to my collection of A*Teens music videos. But no! I get ripped off instead!
B00005JKN9|5.0|Excellent movie.  Great themes.  If only people could look past the length and get to the deep roots of the story. Get to the struggle that the people had at the times.  I thought that this was a great movie and Daniel Day-Lewis is an amazing actor.  He really blew me away...
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium is a brilliant film.  The acting, directing, writing, score, and cinematography are all excellent.  The fight scenes are original and spectacular. Of course, there is the oldest battle in the history of time, good vs. evil.  This movie centers around the very quality which makes us human, emotions, and what might happen if everyone repressed them.  The timing of the story is impeccable. If there was ever a moment in the movie when I thought I might get bored, an unexpected twist occurred to glue me to the screen again.  As soon as I finished watching it, I wanted to watch it again and again, the true test of a great film!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Just trying to give this album an extra push to 5 stars, which is what it deserves. Simply an amazing peice of work, not a bad track on it.
B000092Q4U|5.0|Where do I start?  Just a fantastic...brutal....heavy sound.  Nothing else out there like it.  Probably the best metal CD I've bought in years.  I just ordered their first album, &quot;New American Gospel&quot;, and I can't wait to hear it.<br />If you like metal, just buy it.  You won't be dissapointed.
B000002MUQ|5.0|This album is quite possibly Hagar's best since 5150, there are many rockers such as the title track and the silly but brilliant Amsterdam. Also the ballads Can't Stop Lovin You and Not Enough are pretty good listening. I recommend every fan of the Hagar era of Van Halen to get this album.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Hey its anime and it has the  a short flim from the maker of Cowboy Bebop.  It gets a 5.
0066214122|2.0|Reading this book I got the feeling that I was reading a movie script that wanted to combine Alien with Outbreak. The story was formula. It appears the author was attempting to write a script that would allow a director to make use of particle animation technology along with a number of other special effects. If what you want to read is science fluff, this is your book. On the other hand, I'd wait till the movie comes out (bet on it).
B00005JLEU|5.0|OMG Spirited Away was such a good movie!  I don't own it yet but I'll buy it sometime.  I've been dying to see it, because it was like the movie of the year in Japan.  It also won an Oscar for Best Animated Flim.  It is such a good movie and if you have ever seen Kiki's Delivery Service it is made by the same author.  The movie is just breathe taking and it had great story line, good voice overs including the same girl from Lilo and Stitch.  It's the best cartoon movie I ever seen, it's worth every penny.
0321146530|3.0|I like the way Kent Beck writes his books. And it's sometimes thrilling to read his strange ideas. Having seen so many projects skip unit testing completely the idea of writing tests first strikes me as very good. Mr Beck presents his ideas very clearly and leads the reader through all subtleties and traps of a small example. That's exactly the point where things become interesting for me: How does the academic idea scale when being faced with Web apps, EJBs, XML/XSLT and so on? Hardly any hints about that which makes me wondering if the approach can be used for real projects.
0451457994|5.0|This is an amazing journey phisically and spiritually for human being.  Many surprising ideas that made me hold my breathe for a moment.  I really enjoy the plot and also the richness of philosophy of human life position in the universe.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I thought it would be nearly impossible to come up with a follow up to HYBRID THEORY, but they pulled it of. I'm a HUGE fan of Linkin Park and this is the best cd I own! I would recommend this to any rock fan out there! In my opinion, Hit the Floor is the best and heaviest track along with Faint. But the whole cd is just so damn cool! They once again have pulled off an awesome cd and I'm looking forward to hopefully a next cd!
B00006LLLN|4.0|I really loved their earlier CD So Long, So Wrong with its beautiful vocals and great instrumentals so I was really expecting a continuation of good things here. All I can say that it really wasn't as good. I don't know if Alison was tired or had a cold but her voice didn't have that pure tone like it did on So Long... It's not a bad CD but its not great either.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Forget the ideas and notions of Radiohead \\"returning to the rock\\", because that is just not going to happen. Although there are more guitars present, almost every song on HTTT builds into an explosive finale without the aid of simple rock song structuring. I myself can't see Radiohead trying to do something exactly like The Bends, it just wouldn't work. They are a much different band in a much different musical climate these days anyway. So why go back when there is so much ahead.  Hail To The Thief starts off with a bang titled, \\"2+2=5\\", it's a great mid to fast tempo tune that really explodes with rocking guitars and pounding drums, reminds me of the harder portion of \\"Paranoid Android.\\" The next few songs are a natural extension to what was going on in Kid A and Amnesiac. Electronic wizardry gets all dazzled up with a more structured song arc on things like, \\"Stand Up Sit Down and Backdrifting.\\" While a tune like \\"Sail To The Moon\\" is as haunting as the band has ever been. That particular song is very much in the vein of \\"The Tourist or How To Disappear Completely.\\" \\"We Suck Young Blood\\", is a new song complete with handclaps and a ghostly vocal, it really paints quite the picture of Hollywood (the song was written about the band's impression of the city). The high moments just keep on pounding without any let up what-so-ever. Tracks like The Gloaming and I Will are as draining as they are uplifting. It's this now classic Radiohead dynamic which makes listening to this band such a treat. Even a song as straight forward as the single, \\"There There\\", becomes bigger and more lush with each listen. The whole record does the same and a closing track like \\"Wolf At The Door\\" leaves you wanting more, a little abused, and a little spellbound too. This record is nearly their best work and is as good as Kid A and The Bends. Now is it OK Computer? Well, no, but it doesn't need to be. Simply put, this band can do no wrong at this point.
B000094A6A|1.0|So this is what Will Ferrell has been doing since leaving NBC's Saturday Night Live.  Will Certainly likes to reveal his talents doesn't he?  Jeremy Piven  has been known to do  university students-act-like-kids movies, but this time he is a Dean.  Vince Vaughn plays a smart-aleck.
B000005ALN|5.0|A unique album from a unique artist. Haunting songs that are both timeless and deeply meaningfull. His unique song writing proves to remain timeless. I cannot think of any other artist that combines beauty and truth so profoundly, and does so with such natural ability. The quality of the voice and writing simply has no peers. He has the unique ability to write in a way that is never tiring on repeat listening, and every listen proves more insightfull.<br /> This album was hugely understated when it was released. Along with Listen without.... these 2 albums are what makes michael who he is today. This maybe classified as pop or whatever, but it is really something without barriers or limits.
6305538018|2.0|I'm usually easily entertained by movies, especially Sci-Fi ones, but this one just didn't work for me, and some parts I just thought were pretty silly. And that's despite my usually liking Cronenberg films. For example, I thought his Naked Lunch and Crash were terrific, two movies with the sort of dark, disturbing, and sinister themes that Cronenberg knows how to make the most of. But this one just seemed to fall flat, including the existential reality-questioning aspect of the movie, and the puzzles that arise from that, which might have been really fun. For example, at one point toward the end of the film it's hard to determine whether the characters are actually in their \\"normal\\" reality or whether they're in some cyberpunk alternative reality. As I said, that might have been really fun if done differently, but unfortunately the film gets pretty cliched at that point and starts going downhill from there. I hate to say it, because I'm usually a fan of his movies, but at that point this one really just turns into a turkey. I mean a serious one. It was still gobbling, scratching, and pecking when I left the theater. There should have been a food kiosk in the theater serving turkey dressing and cranberry sauce so people could have had it with the movie. Oh well, sorry about that David. I really am usually a fan of your movies.
055357342X|5.0|Hardly slept through any of the books. Very well written with incredible story. Well developed characters are either love them or hate them but you do care one way or the other. Only complaint is waiting for the next book. The series started strong from page one and has gotten better through each chapter.  All hail George R R Martin the new king of fantasy!
B000002NIW|5.0|Wow. This is an Amazing Cd. I love the Deftones. They are one of the best bands out there and this is the best of their four cds. Chino, despite the fact that he is not VOCALLY talented, he works with what he has and creates some of the most emotional from the heart versailte vocals I have ever heard, despite not being very MUSICALLY talented. As I've said before, I dont think very highly of their drummer, his playing is decent on this cd. This is the perfect balance of melody and aggression and one of the best cds ever
B00005QIPH|1.0|The title says it all, after listening to the hype then the disc you'll be asking yourself the same question......&quot;Is this it&quot;?
B000092ZYX|5.0|I've been anticipating this album for a few months, and I bought it two days ago.  After listening to it, I realized that those few months were MORE THAN worth the wait.  Their work on this album is pure genius!  Their signature experimental sound digs into deeper levels on every track.  &quot;There There&quot; is sure to be a hit, as will this album!  Their synthesizer sound has an additional unique rhythm as their previous efforts.  Anybody who can pull off playing a track backwards, &quot;Backtrack&quot;, is always worth the listen.  Now, there's only one debate: which album of Radiohead's is better, &quot;Ok Computer&quot; or &quot;Hail To the Thief&quot;.  If you're reading this, I'd like to hear your opinion because this is a tough debate to settle, and I cannot do this by myself.....Anyone?
0440237688|5.0|Jonas has the perfect life.  There is no war, no pain, no unemployment - everyone is assigned a job in the community.  Everything is taken care of.  When Jonas turns twelve, he is assigned to the lonely but highly honored job of Receiver of Memory.  In his new life he discovers that his Utopian lifestyle has not been around forever, that before his day there was more than this.  There was war, there was pain, poverty, joy, colors, happiness; much more feeling than anyone in his lifestyle has ever experienced.  The Giver, who is giving Jonas all the memories of the past, is training him so that the community can call upon Jonas when they need wisdom.  Jonas later becomes confused, because he is to bear the burden of the past while the mindless drones in the community continue their `perfect' lives.  He wonders if one person is to bear this burden while the others continue not knowing anything, or if everyone should know the truth of the past.  He discusses his feelings with The Giver, and they hatch a plan.  Want to find out more? Read the book!
B00000K0EA|3.0|The 18th Bond entry doesn't have quite the invigorated feel of Goldeneye but still manages to thrill. The plot is a bit contrived (but aren't all Bond films)with a villan that isn't as threatening as others because he doesn't do much in the way of his own dirty deeds. Still, it's an interesting comment on the globalization of the media when the bad guy can be a Rupert Murdoch type zillonaire.<br />Tomorrow works best when Brosnan and co-star Michelle Yeoh are on screen together. While they don't always boast the best chemistry, their stunt and action sequences together are quite dazzling. Bond fits Brosnan like a well tailored suit in his second appearence. He inhabits the role and makes it his own. There isn't quite as much depth or angst evident in the bulk of the film to compare to meeting his ex-lover (Terri Hatcher), his discovery of her fate and his own execution of \\"The Doctor\\".<br />The commentary by director Roger Spottiswoode wasn't half as interesting to me as that provided by the second unit crew. Spottiswoode shows that he does have a knack for action films which is surprising given his background as a director of character driven films. That background, though, comes to the fore during several important scenes and his ease with the actors is evident by the performances turned in by Jonathan Pryce.<br />The stunts are dazzling particularly the impossible one pulled off when Yeoh and Bronsnan must leap from the top of a skyscraper. Their ingenius (and highly unlikely) solution to escape works due to deft editing and photography. Although not the best of the Brosnan Bonds (and, yes, it's going to be just as hard to replace him as it was Connery), it has its moments.
B00005JLT5|1.0|This movie is about A jew that survives the whole bloody war. In the end some German finds him , feels sorry for him and lets him live. He also goes on on play the Piano after all the $*** he has been through. Sorry if I messed up the ending but what can I say.......
B000065VA1|5.0|Que este disco no esté puntuado con 5 estrellas en esta web lo único que demuestra es que el sistema de puntuación no está muy depurado que digamos.<br />Es uno de los mejores discos que he oído. Imprescindible.
B00004U2GH|5.0|This album is simply amazing!  I grew up on Johnny Cash, I must have worn out my parents Orange Blossom special record playing over and over.  I am rediscovering this awesome musical legend.  The Man in Black is simply the best.  He is much bigger than country music itself.  He is an institution and can not be duplicated!<br />This particular album, Live at San Quentin is striking... it is a brisk trip back to the sixties with a 37 year old performer who let's it all hang out.  What a great thing Johnny did for these prisoners at San Quentin, when he decided to give a concert for them.<br />Johnny Cash has never been afraid to dip deep into the fallen nature of man and take on the darkest parts of our nature. Many of his best songs explore these areas of our lives. He is also a compassionate man who cares deeply about the downtrodden.  That is seen so well in this live concert.<br />Johnny is at his best on the classic tracks, &quot;I walk the Line&quot; and &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;.  But also takes on some tough tasks. He wrote a song especially for the prisoners entitled, &quot;San Quentin&quot; and it literally brought the house down!  They made him sing it twice!<br />Johnny also shares a song he wrote with Bob Dylan, &quot; Wanted Man&quot; and covers a John Sebastion song, &quot;Darling Companion&quot;.  Both are excellent songs.<br />One of my favorites is his first live performance of the now classic song, &quot;A Boy Named Sue.&quot;  It is hilarious.  I can't believe Shel Silverstein wrote it :-)<br />The guests he brought with him: June Carter Cash, The Carter Family Singers, Carl Perkins and the Statler Brothers really add to the depth of quality in this concert.  They all are unique artists and have a real opportunity to shine with Johnny!<br />I highly recommend this worthy album.  It is an excellent recording!
6305842442|3.0|I found the narative of the theactrical cut to help the film along better than without it.  I still enjoyed the movie though.  I wish I could find a theactrical version, but it seems they all just disappeared.  Someone tell me if they know where I can get that version.  Blade Runner is one of the finest science fiction films that I have seen.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books of all time! Although it was written about 2 centuries ago, it doesn't matter because it tells a timeless and believable story. All 5 Bennet daughters need to find husbands, preferably rich ones. How they go about it and how Elizabeth learns to love Mr. Darcy is absolutely fascinating, not only because of the way it is told, but because it shows people as they really are when something important is at stake. Fabulous!
B000092ZYX|1.0|I am sorry, but i am so sick of reading bogus raving reviews of Radioheads latest effort claiming how brilliant it is. Hail to the thief is recycled ... from them and not in the least way brilliant. They repeat themselves from albums past with death marches such as \\"Sail to the moon\\" which is basically a bad version of \\"Tourist\\" from o.k. computer, or take your pic of about 3 other absolute death marches. Radiohead is a band that has its head so far up its own patoot that they forgot how to write songs in favor of trying to create sonic landscapes from hell and doing bad impersanations of autechre and sigur ros. It seems thom yorke has basically completely given up on singing in favor of droning like a digeridoo. Melodies are conspicously missing for the 2nd straight album. I keep waiting for Radiohead to get overthemselves and fulfill their promise that they showed earlier in their career with such great albums like the bends and ok computer. They had rock royalty written all over them and now theyve become so self indulgent i fear thatwill never come to fruition.
006092988X|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a novel that I read when I was a young girl and one that I've reread several times since then. I love Francie Nolan's story and the descriptions of Brooklyn, NY in bygone years. I love the character because she's growing up practically without any guidance. And I enjoy her guts and her determination to become a writer. The affection she feels for her father is touching and something that many people even today can relate to. All in all, a great book!
0385504209|4.0|I bought this book after watching Dan Brown interviewed by Matt on the Today Show. It was a good interview and the premise of a religious symbologist as a main character interested me.  That coupled with my interest in the Knights Templar and the Catholic Church made it a necessary read for me.<br />It was a good read.  The premises it played with were fun, thoughtful and on occasion the author even managed to confuse me a little with his twists.  I mean confusion in a good way.  However, there were certain &quot;symbols&quot; which arose that I picked up on immediately and which took his main character far to long considering his profession.  The cryptograms were fun to play with and the final twist was delicious although that was telegraphed a little as well.<br />The writing is fast paced, very literate and I never got the feeling that the author was trying to show how bright he is, which is often the case in this type of thriller.<br />It's a good, fun read...I recommend it.  This was my first novel of Dan Brown's and I have just ordered Angels and Demons.  He's not Umberto Eco...but who is?

0783225857|5.0|When I ordered the TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD DVD from Amazon.com last week, little did I know that Gregory Peck would be gone just a day after it arrived in my mailbox.  Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch is one of the greatest cinematic characters of all-time!  He had what many of today's Hollywood actors sorely lack - INTEGRITY, MORALITY, CHARACTER and HONOR!  If you don't own any other movie in your DVD collection, YOU NEED TO GET THIS ONE!!!
B00000ILBK|2.0|Repeat after me---<br />Star Trek is NOT a comedy!<br />Star Trek is NOT a musical!<br />Star Trek is about exploring strange new worlds and exciting adventures...which this is NOT!<br />An revengeful alien wants to remove some peaceable people from off &quot;his planet&quot;.<br />Not even F. Murray Abraham can save this movie!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Now, I'm not a t.A.T.u. or Tatu basher like many of the 450-or-so reviewers who have shared their opinion about the group, in fact, I gave the CD 4 stars which it deserves. This album is pure techno-pop, I won't even be afraid to call it Euro-cheese, yet I found it so refreshing to hear.  There are so many pre-manufactured bands or singers in America who start out with this sweet-girl-next-door image and then try to prove that they're edgier by taking off their clothes.  Tatu consists of two cute Russian girls who are the complete opposite of American acts. They explode onto the music scene with a CD which they haven't produced or written and a lesbian-gimmick, which really worked, although the girls claim they are bisexual these days. Many have complained about these facts but I still prefer it to some Orange County native singing about a boy leaving her or a boy she wants to have over and over in 13 songs. The album is short, but all the songs are very good and most of them are highly danceable.<br />Here's the tracklist:<br />1-Not Gonna Get Us: Annoying song which gets stuck into your head for days and you end up loving it after a few listens.<BR>2-All The Things She Said: This song speaks for itself.<BR>3-Show Me Love: Less annoying than Not Gonna Get Us but still not to be listened to if you have a headache.<BR>4-30 Minutes: A nice calm ballad with wicked lyrics, beautiful song.<BR>5-How Soon Is Now?: Smiths' cover, very well done, it's nice to see Tatu explore a \\"rockier\\" sound which I hope they will pursue in next albums.<BR>6-Clowns (Can You See Me Now?): Very catchy song, very fast and techno-ish.<BR>7-Malchik Gay: Song about a girl who has unrequitted feelings for a gay guy. Very different perspective and catchy as hell.<BR>8-Stars: The masterpiece of this album, different sound. The freshest Tatu song, it will leave you craving more.<BR>9-Ya Soshla S Uma: Russian All The Things She Said, better than the English version, Tatu seem to put more emotion intotheir Russian songs.<BR>10-Nas Ne Dogoniat: Russian Not Gonna Get Us, same opinion as 9.<BR>11-Show Me Love (Extended): More Show Me Love if you haven't had enough already.<br />In reality, the CD only showcases 8 songs which leave you wanting more and more. My advice to the avid Tatu fan is to get the Russian versions to all the songs, they are even better than the English ones. Plus check out other untranslated songs like Prostie Dvizhenya and Ne Ver' Ne Boisya (Eurovision 3rd place winner in 2003).<br />Finally, I admit that the singers have limited vocal abilities live, but they deliver all they promise, just plain good pop music. I hope other Russian singers can follow in the footsteps of Tatu minus the gimmicks, if you're interested check out ALSOU, a genuinely talented singer who should have enjoyed world success long ago.
B00007BH5C|5.0|This is another amazing blend of musical excellency for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. These combined styles of music bring out the emotion and action in the movie of J. R. R. Tolien's &quot;The Two Towers.&quot; It is filled with surprise in dynamics, tune and pronunciation. As I listen to it on my stereo, I can acually recall the parts of the movie that went with them, having seen it three times. The music is very well defined and I would recommend it to any avid &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; or classical music collector.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Amazing.  Different from any other album but still has some leanings on ok to amn. I don't like the gloaming but what can you do.
B000002HRE|1.0|This album is not only a let down for Metallica fans, its a let down for music in general. I have been a Metallica for many many years and this is obviously the worst, even worse than Load, which at least had a couple decent tunes. Its a bad album by music standards as well, I put it right up there with Gruntruck's wreck of a first album. The album is unlistenable too. St. Anger is ok, at least they are raw and aggressive like the old days in the music. Reload is just plain Horrible.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I just wanted to comment on a previous review regarding the static in the center channel.  I experienced the exact same thing, after a few songs, on Disc 1.  Just in Dolby 5.1--not with DTS or Dolby 2.0.  And Disc 2 sounds great in 5.1, no static that I notice.  I thought it was just my system at first.  Annoying but because DTS sounds so good it's not really a big issue for me.  I just listen in DTS for Albert Hall and Dolby 5.1 for the rest.  Outstanding DVD otherwise, I am in rock heaven...
B00006CXXU|5.0|Face it.  In 1998, when Ms. Aguilera if you will, burst on the scene, she was a teenager, as were most of her fans.  But with her 2002 release, STRIPPED, she puts out another CD her fans will like, and manages to realize her fans aren't the same age that they were, but is the same age she is.  If Christina gets noted for anything, it is surely the video for \\"Dirrty\\", the pure popness of \\"Beautiful\\" and the fierce \\"Fighter\\".  The next single \\"Can't Hold Us Down (Feat. L'il Kim)\\" is just as hot as the artists who are in it.  Here's to the new Mariah, hopefully without the emotional breakdown.  Thank You Xtina.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Sabrina (played by Julia Ormond) was a geeky loner who sat up in a tree watching and fantasizing about a man named David (played by Greg Kinnear) - a lovable, charming ladies' man. She later spends a few years in Paris, and upon her return home, she is transformed into a sensual, sophisticated woman. Unknowingly, David picks her up after she was seen hitchhiking (albeit with a different appearance), and slowly begins to fall for her. They both seem to get the chance to have what they (or rather Sabrina) wanted a few years back.<br />And here is where the story takes a few twists. David's older, wiser, and seemingly callous businessman brother Linus (played by Harrison Ford) notices the sparks between David and Sabrina, and immediately concocts a scheme to break them apart. The reason for this is because the business of which Linus is involved, was going to reach an agreement for a nice business deal involving the parents of David's then-fianc&eacute;e, Liz (played by Lauren Holly), but soon realizes if David falls for Sabrina, then he'll no longer have much interest in Liz, and therefore, the deal would be jeopardized. So, Linus takes it upon himself to try his best to get Sabrina out of the picture. He goes to low lengths in trying to keep David and Sabrina apart - one of them is the darkly hilarious scheme which involved keeping David on heavy sedatives, which were really intended to be minor painkillers due to an unfortunate accident involving drinking glasses. These would keep him bed-ridden and disoriented. Inbetween all of this, Linus manipulates Sabrina by trying to pass himself off as a subtly charming and romantic guy, which in return gains her affections. But, something goes haywire in the scheme -- Linus starts to fall in love with her.<br />It must be mentioned that the ending scene (the one before Linus flies off to Paris to find Sabrina) was quite clever, spellbindingly &amp; inexplicably funny, but in a subtle, classy, European manner. Doesn't seem like the kind of thing you see in many films, especially in the romantic heading.<br />As of yet, I haven't seen the original version of this starring Audrey Hepburn, so I won't bother making any comparisons. The story is quite charming, and features a nice amalgamation of humor, wit, romance and intelligence. The performances were all well-done, and Julia Ormond was quite lovable as the perceptive, innocent, elegant and vulnerable Sabrina. Harrison Ford gave a nice performance as the cold, scheming, lackadaisical-in-temperament Linus, which really doesn't seem like much of a stretch for him (the temperament part anyway), and Greg Kinnear as always is charming and charismatic. Also features Hollywood legend Angie Dickinson. An enjoyable, sophisticated romantic film.

078322608X|4.0|As with most Terry Gilliam films, this one is dense, somewhat complex, and often confusing.  The upshot is that it never cheats - everything that happens is in character and within the logic of the world Gilliam has created.  Unfortunately, the density causes the first viewing to be overwhelming, but adds to its replayability.  It is a film enjoyed more the second and third time than the first.<br />The story: an engineered virus is released in the 90's that eventually wipes out most of the human race.  The remnants flee underground to a system of caves and sewers to escape the virus.  Due to the rapid mutation of the virus, no cure or vaccine can be developed without a sample of the original virus from the 90's.  Therefore, they must send someone back in time to obtain the sample; that person is Cole, played by Bruce Willis.  Naturally, he is mistaken for a mental patient and locked up where he meets Dr. Reilly (Madeline Stowe) and fellow inmate Goines (Brad Pitt), whose father happens to be a molecular biologist specialising in viruses.<br />This sets up the hunt for the perpetrators of the virus release, thought to go by the name of &quot;the Army of the 12 Monkeys.&quot;  Is it Goines and his animal-rights friends?  Is it his father, the virus expert?  Or is it actually Cole himself in some sort of time-paradox?  We are left guessing until the end, and if you haven't been paying attention, it might seem that the story has cheated, but in fact it hasn't.  You can't guess the solution (there isn't enough information), but it is logical.<br />There are a number of great touches, one of which I'll mention here.  Cole has nightmares about a shooting that he witnessed as a child.  The people in the dream occasionally change faces, however, based on who Cole is suspicious of at the time.  This is both misleading and accurate - memory is subjective, and it's only logical that a child's memory of a traumatic event would be fluxional.<br />These types of details are the rewards of repeated watchings.  Also rewarding are the performances of the three principles.  This DVD version is of good quality, including a 90-minute making-of feature that is interesting in that it was filmed while the production was occurring, allowing an inside glimpse of the tension and creative differences between actors, director, and producer.
B00008PX8P|5.0|To A viewer from nyc:<BR>I too found some high pitched static coming from the center channel in Dolby 5.1 mode, particularly during the Earl's Court set at high-pitched segments (like Plant's vocals-maybe his pants were too tight :)). But Page's violin bow thing during the Albert Hall set did not produce static. I've had this happen before, but I forget which DVD. <br />What I liked most about these performances is I can tell what parts of the music get the band off the most. Page loves to boogie and Bonzo the human metronome loves to hammer away one minute and tiptoe through the tulips the next-a good appreciation of dynamics basically. To see the band playing through the years really shows them as ordinary blokes having a romp instead of as rock gods.
B000001FE0|4.0|Maybe the most ambitious Bee Gees album? There is certainly some wonderful late 60s pop here. Originally released in 1969 as a double LP with luxurious gold lettering on faux red velvet foldout cover. The seven and a half minute title track is a mini-suite that's almost worth the price of admission in itself. There are also well integrated country influences (like everyone else they were listening to The Band), heartbreaking melodies worthy of Abba at their best, Spectoresque layer cakes of melody and grandeur, trippy Beach Boys influenced harmonies, and much much more. Does it all hold together as a cohesive whole? No, not really but there are so many fine things here that any self respecting explorer of '60s pop at it's most imaginative, owes it to themselves to delve within.

B00000DGXN|5.0|The only odd thing may be that Corea's piano sounds a little electric or off at times. This could be from the mix it could be form the piano tuner or manufacturer. Chick plays it very well as usual though. As a pianist of 35 years, I think its the piano more than anything, the voicing of the piano 2nd, and the mix 3rd.<br />This album is about two things: a light vibrant and brilliant instrumentation (opposite of heavy sounding) and  musical interplay. If you listen carefully to the cymbals, the vibe, the guitar youll get the idea. Holland holds up the low end beautifully with resonant tone and musical involvement. Corea serves as the catalyst for much of interaction. There is a lot of point and counterpoint in terms of free ideas interwoven within the melody. This album is far from a jamm session. <br />If you are into the thought that goes behind the playing, then you'll really enjoy this album. If you listen to it like Jazz Improv 101 at the community college (we play the head then we all take a few choruses) then youll hate it.<br />Cognition, Timbre and Interplay all set a beautiful mood for the album's entirety.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Where to begin?<br />2 months ago I downloaded the demos that were leaked -- fell in love with the album, constantly playing it over and over and over...<br />I picked up the special edition, and played the cd -- there are a few mixes different from the demos... but none the less, perfection all along...<br />I'm going to point out the songs that I think are standouts;<br />'2+2=5' -- think of it as 'Airbag' meets 'Planet Telex', it's incredible, and proves Radiohead can still rock out.<br />'Go To Sleep' -- Sort of like 'The Bends' meets 'Subterranean Homesick Alien' it's a great acoustic song with it's rock bits mixed in there. <br />'We Suck Young Blood' -- at first the song wasn't a standout for me, but after repeated playings of this song, it grew on me. The piano/claps/vocals are just amazing -- it's a simple song, and then halfway through they jam it up, then slow back down... talk about a ride...<br />'There There' -- the single from the album, it's got a feel of 'Lucky' to it, it's incredibly well done, and it begins out funky -- then builds to this incredible jam, loud guitars, Thom's vocals... just incredible...<br />'A Punch-Up At A Wedding' -- this is a song that can't be compared to anything really -- it's new, and I love it -- the beeps/drums, piano and bass on this song are smooth. It's like a calm way of telling someone you [upset] them off... another great song<br />'Myxomatosis' -- think of 'I Might Be Wrong' meets 'Everything In It's Right Place' it's got a electronic/rock feel to it, it feels like a Kid A/Amnesiac song.<br />'Scatterbrain' -- This is another one that can't be compared, it's just amazing -- Thom singing his heart out loud -- it's like a hopeless realistic song, \\"Somewhere I got Scatterbrain\\" like it's a song of realizing it's hopeless...<br />'Wolf At The Door' -- Just like 'Life In A Glass House' this has sort of a jazzy feel to it, and Thom's vocals are different in this one. Great back up vocals accompany this song, and the song maintains an 'eerie' feel to it, but none the less, great way to end the album.<br />Thom's vocals on this album are very similiar to OK Computer, Ed and Johnny's guitar playing are incredible on this one. Instead of experimenting on the previous two records, they return to rock. The piano playing on this album are flawless, and Phil's drumming is topnotch.<br />So if you're looking for a different, refreshing yet rocking album -- pick up this cd NOW! You won't be disappointed.

B000069AUI|5.0|How to describe this one...<br />If you thought 'Parachutes' was not rocking enough, or too mellow -- prepare to be amazed at 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head'<br />This album pushes Coldplay to their limits. If you want an idea of what they album is like, thinking of \\"Don't Panic\\" meets \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Trouble\\" , the music is more piano based in this one. But that doesn't mean that they've gone soft. <br />Opening track \\"Politik\\" -- is a hard hit in your face track, where it begins like thunder, then calms down, then goes back into a powerful song. Chris Martin gives his soul in this song, as a plea to the world to 'Open up your eyes' a realization of what is going around in the world now.<br />\\"In My Place\\" -- begins with a drum beat, then blossoms like a flower opening to the sun light. Chris humbly sings \\"In my place / Where lines I couldn't change / I was lost oh yeah\\" the song goes into a \\"uplifting\\" chorus when Chris sings \\"How long will you wait for it? / How much will you pay for it? \\" Jonny Buckland's riff in this song is incredibly addictive, which you have you doing an air guitar to the song. The song ends sweetly with Chris repeating the first line of song.<br />\\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" -- feels like Yellow pt2, but a more hipper, uplifting track. The guitars and drums are flowing nicely, to make you want to headbang to the song. Chris sings \\"I have to say / I wasted all your time / Honey-honey\\" which is probably the coolest lyric I've heard in a while. <br />\\"The Scientist\\" -- at first I couldn't feel what other people where saying about this track. Then eventually, I felt it -- this track reminded me of a relationship in which it was a mistake. It feels like \\"Trouble\\" pt2, The piano, acoustic guitar and has sort of a \\"string\\" feel to it, it is beautifully well done. Chris sings \\"I'm going back to start\\" as like it's hopeless and is going to try again. The song is very beautiful and ends with Chris \\"oo-ing\\" at the end, and the song ends beautifully.<br />\\"Clocks\\" -- Begins with a beautiful piano piece, then the band joins in for a nice mix of the song. Chris sings a story book to us, with descriptive lines like \\"Shoot an apple off my / Trouble that can't be maimed / The tigers waiting to be tamed\\" There is also a string feel to this one. At the end, Chris sings \\"Home / Home / Where I wanted to go\\" and the song gloriously fades out at a high note.<br />\\"Daylight\\" -- Don't know about this one, sort of like Clocks -- it also has a U2 \\"Beautiful Day\\" feel to it also.<br />\\"Green Eyes\\" -- Feels like Yellow pt3, Chris sings in praisal \\"Green Eyes / Yeah the spotlight shines upon you / And anyone who tries to deny you / Must be out of their mind\\" like a song about one special person.<br />\\"Warning Sign\\" -- Begins with a guitar strum, then piano and strings come in -- and just blend together to delievery a sad, dark, yet warm ballad. Chris sings \\"A Warning Sign / I missed the good part / And I realized / I started looking / And the bubbled burst / I started looking for excuses\\" It's like a song where you could've let go in a relationship, but didn't and now you feel the consequence for it. Chris pleads, as most people would do to get someone back, \\"Come on in / I got to tell you what a state I'm in / I have to tell you in my loudest tongues / That I started looking for a warning sign\\" then the song builds up to it's chorus, which it has a confessional \\" Well the truth is / I miss you / Yeah the truth is / I miss you so\\" The song ends with the chorus and Chris sings \\" And I'm tired / I should've let you go\\" then softly plays the piano and a warm, sort of \\"get together\\" feeling at the end song forms, Chris sings \\"So I crawl back into your open arms\\" and the song fades out with Chris singing that line... Gorgeous song, without a doubt the best song on the album.<br />\\"A Whisper\\" -- Somewhat comparable to Radiohead's \\"Electroneering\\" but with a piano, it's got sort of a big air feel to it. Not as great as 'Clocks' or 'TheScientist'<br />\\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" -- Chris begins by singing \\" Said I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down / I'm going to put this six feet underground \\" Like it's a threat, think of Travis's \\"Last Train\\" this song is also like a promise to get revenge on someone or something that happened. Chris sings \\"I'm going to buy a gun and start a war / If you can tell me something worth fighting for \\" Which powerful questions the point of war, let alone violence. The chorus is like an explanation for the \\"break down\\" feel to the song. A powerful song with a powerful message. <br />\\"Amsterdam\\" -- Think of Trouble, this song is about relief, almost has a \\"Let It Be\\" feeling to it. Chris makes the reference \\"You came along and you cut me free\\" which sounds like it's about getting away from a dangerous situation. Jonny's guitar piece at the end and Chris's piano playing end this song perfectly.<br />So this is definitely a step up from Parachutes, I'd say it's like taking Parachutes and doubling it. It's going to be interesting to see Coldplay's third album top this. <br />If you can't get enough of this album, check out the B-sides to the singles; \\"One I Love\\" \\"1.36\\" \\"I Ran Away\\" \\"Crest Of Waves\\" \\"I Bloom Blaum\\" and the newly recorded \\"Animals\\" <br />If you don't have this cd, GET IT NOW! Easily one of the best releases of 2002 -- if not, the ESSENTIAL of 2002.
B000067DNC|5.0|From the first season to the sixth season it been great.  I can say only the best of things for stargate.  I belive that stargate Sg-1 has the makings for many season to come.  I love the polt and Love the cast. I can't wait for tonights season 7 permire. I will be a loyal customer for every.  But love every single season and hopefuly i can say the same thing about the new season.<br /> Thanks for leting me voice my review.
B00005QDW1|3.0|I've never, at any point, been a fan of No Doubt. I always found their music grating and irritating. That why, through gritted teeth, I have to painfully admit that this CD is actually ... pretty good.<br />I hope all of you No doubt fans enjoy this one too, because judging by the ammount of collaborations that Gwen has done recently, she looks like she being set up as a solo act.<br />I hope the rest of the band invested in a good 401K ...
B00003CX8U|5.0|And so they do in what is arguably the most electrifying erotic sequence captured on film. Nope, it's not an orgy nor a  couple faking  passion---It's a  dance number.<br />Surprised?<br />Do you dance? I mean have you ever really, really gotten into it at a party or a nightclub?  When it clicks, the gods take hold. Dionysus made flesh.<br />With the phenomenal success of \\"Chicago\\" a new generation has been re-discovering the director of 'Cabaret' and 'All That Jazz'---Broadway's greatest choreographer, Bob Fosse. <br />Dead for nearly two decades, his influence continues to grow. Many have tried but no one has been able to match his style.<br />Ok, so what's the plot of the movie? <br />Roy Schreider plays Joe Gideon, a thinly disguised Fosse. He's the director and choreographer of a Broadway musical who is  fighting the clock to come up with original ideas before opening night.<br /> Ruthlessly self driven,  He pops amphetamines, so he can be always 'on.' (It's Showtime!)  Destructive towards his health, he ends up fighting the clock in more ways than one.<br />Though Gideon states that his only belief, his only certainty is the reality of death, he's really a woshipper of The Goddess. To call him a womanizer is to miss the point.  Women are his religion. <br />Thus we have Jessica Lange,  a sexy and bemused Angel of Death, who is is mythically woven in 'dream sequences' with the real  women in Gideon's life:  A threefold Muse arrangement comprised of his young daughter, his current girlfriend and his older ex-wife.  Men are not important. There is no secondary male lead.<br />The music is spectacular. The dancing even more so. Schreider and the supporting cast are superb. The flaboyant show biz world, contrasted by the intimate scenes at home work well to pull the audience into Gideon's mind.<br />Many a good film is derivative from an earlier classic. The Nutty Professor is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Jaws is Moby Dick and \\"All That Jazz\\" is Chaplin's bittersweet masterpiece of soul, \\"Limelight.\\" Too many similarities to explore, so  I'll confine myself to two: Both are love letters to artists and both are the 'last will and testament' of the director, a tribute of his life.<br /> (Moral: If you're going to steal, steal from the best.)<br />People, you've got to see this film!
B000066I6N|4.0|I bought this album today, along with Mark Knopfler's &quot;The Ragpicker's Dream&quot; and Ben Harper's &quot;Diamonds On The Inside&quot;. When I came home, it was the first one which went into the CD player. I was very curious to see if Plant and his fellow musicians would rock again as they did with five-star &quot;Fate of Nations&quot; in 1993. I've always liked Led Zeppelin but never been a big fan of them, and have only one Plant solo album, but what led me to buy &quot;Dreamland&quot; is the expectation of another great album like Fate Of Nations. Although this one is a little bit different in style, I liked it instantly just because the musicianship is first-rate and all songs are a class of their own. Being familiar with Dylan's &quot;One More Cup Of Coffee&quot; only, my knowledge about these old pieces was limited. But I liked them all a lot. My favorites are, in no particular order, &quot;Darkness Darkness&quot;, &quot;Win My Train Fare Home&quot;, &quot;Morning Dew&quot; and &quot;Song To The Siren&quot;. These latter two are excellent ballads which employ some beautiful string parts, much to my enjoyment. &quot;Song To The Siren&quot; is probably the lushest sounding piece of the album, having strings, pedal steel &amp; acoustic guitars respect and complement each other so well. I think if there's just one song here which may get skipped by me time to time, it's &quot;Hey Joe&quot;. I know it's one of the stronger moments of the album as the musical unity of the band is at the peaks, but it's a little bit too much psychedelic for my tastes, being at the more experimental side. As for the band, bassist Charlie Jones is the only member from the good old times of &quot;Fate Of Nations&quot;, but the new ones are equally capable, especially it is a delight to listen Porl Thompson (ex-The Cure guitarist) at the top of his form. The unique and lovely sound of his guitar was one of the main attractions which turned me into a big The Cure follower at &quot;The Disintegration&quot; and &quot;Wish&quot; days. Now back into subject and here is my closing words: If you're gonna buy this album, you can expect a well-preserved, well-aged and more-matured voice from Robert Plant, beautifully crafted songs, virtuoso musicianship and it won't disappoint you. My personal advice is : Put the CD in your player, start with track 5, listen to it and the next two tracks at once. They are the jewels in this album and you'll love them.
B000092ZYY|5.0|This is a group of musicians, true artists, who better themselves each and every album and this is their next evolution.  They continue to challenge themselves, and their fans, to follow them along for the ride.  True Radiohead fans know this, trendy \\"Creep-y Bends-y\\" types will not understand the genius behind this masterwork.  This is their best album, hands down (which varies from my personal favorite, OK Computer, but I am still willing to admit Hail.... to be their best.).  If you want to listen to REAL MUSIC, you MUST pick this album up NOW.  If not, then lock yourself up in your room and watch your TRL and keep listening to your cookie-cutter, wanna-be emo, flash in the pan bands.
B000096I9G|4.0|Concise, accurate review from a long-time Cure fan who is VERY familiar with their live work:<br />1)Sound quality - Excellent.<br />2)Video quality - Average. Very \\"VHS-quality,\\" and not sharp.<br />3)Editing quality - Poor.  Whoever assembled this video felt the need to rotate between all 12 camera views as quickly as possible for much of the show.  It's very disorienting, and makes all of the musicians' subtle nuances look like stereotypical posing.<br />4)Performance quality - Varied.  I have to disagree with the \\"official\\" review here almost completely.  The Pornography and Bloodflowers performances were the best, overall.<br />The Disintegration set, on the other hand, suffered from poor tones (Simon's bass tone was too raw and harsh, Robert's Bass VI was very weak in volume and somewhat scratchy, and Roger's keyboards were often not loud enough).  These same problems also affected the 2 encore songs, \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\" and \\"The Kiss.\\"<br />That all being said, this is a worthwhile purchase for any Cure fan, though it may not be the best introduction for those not familiar with the band.  I would recommend the \\"Show\\" video for someone looking for a more representative (and better filmed) performance.
0446608955|1.0|This is one of the worst books i've had the misfortune of reading.  It is your run of the mill oprah book club type books where two totally incompatible people fall in love against the odds, and then one dies of cancer.  Could it be any more predictable.  A truly original ending would have had Jaime turn out to be a cyborg.  Just because a book is on the New York Times Bestseller list doesn't mean its a great literary work.  Get a clue you Lemmings!  Go read Hamlet, Pride and Prejudice is a romance novel but at it was well written.  For a great novel that has romance, passion and tragedy try Anna Karenina!  I only gave this book one star because zero wasn't an option.
B000089RVX|5.0|Fallen is the best album of the year so far, i love evry song and dont skip any songs at all, the cover is interesting and that is what made me buy the cd.  I especially like bring me to life and my immortal, but it asnt got a bad song on it,
B00008H2LB|5.0|This album is 100% hardcore listening to please the pickiest listener. It is just as good as their fist album \\"Hybrid Theory.\\" I loved this album! It was loud, but it expressed feelings and issues that i can relate to. I first bought Linkin Park's first album in January and listened to that CD for 3 months straight! Honestly, I didn't have anything else in my discman. I then invested in both \\"Reanimation\\" and \\"Meteora\\" and they havn't failed to disappoint me. This album is extremely good and I can really relate to the message put out by each song. For example, the last song on the album, \\"Numb\\" goes \\"tired of being what you want me to be, feeling so faithless, lost under the surface..\\" As a teen, I've felt like this countless times but listening to any of their CD's picks me right up. My friends are mostly teenyboppers whose idea of punk rock is \\"Hero\\" by Chad Kroeger, so naturally they all think Im on the brink of insanity. I BEG you, buy this album and you will LOVE it as much as I do.
B000058983|5.0|Forever Changes is an album I'd heard of for a very long time.  Finally I decided to buy it, and realized that all the hype about it being an 'overlooked masterpiece' were quite correct.  The mood varies with a sense of irony from playful, to ominous, to, ultimately, life-affirming.  <br />The bonus tracks are of historical interest.  But they should be skipped in order to properly experience the album.
1587990717|2.0|This book motivated me to write a review for the first time.  In full disclosure I should state that I have been in finance for over 15 years, including the last 13 years in trading.  (This included time on the CME in Chicago in the FX Options pits at the same time as the author, although I do not know him personally.)<br />Starting with the positive, I found the subject matter very interesting.  Similar to what I could gather about the author, I lean toward a more intuitive analysis of the markets.  Therefore I found his style, theories and explanations easy to read, and good at keeping my interest.  He often uses an intersting anecdote or method to explain his ideas on probability.  It caused me to think about things in a different way, which is a good thing.  <br />The problem for me starts when he begins to talk about himself or his life philosophy.  Anyone who has been in trading for an extended period of time has seen the trader who takes big risks and makes big profits, only to see him blow-up down the road when his trading style is no longer in vogue.  Taleb covers the subject as if he is 'outing' this guy as a fraud (not exactly a revelation).  And then proceeds to imply that most trading success can also be explained more by luck than skill.  Yet somehow his own personal strategy  (buy low-delta options and wait for a big event because these events are mis-priced) is clearly in the realm of skill-based trading.<br />When Taleb delves outside the world of trading it only gets worse.  He proceeds to put down anyone who does not spend their afternoons sitting in a Paris cafe discussing the ancient philosophers, which of course he does.  In one section he belittles anyone who has an MBA (which I do not), irritatingly generalizing about tens of thousands of people, only to justify it by saying that he also has an MBA, so he knows what he's talking about (although he is different than the other MBAs of course).<br />All in all, the number of times Taleb engagesin this type of intellectual and/or lifestyle superiority is so unbelievably high it fatally detracted from my ability to enjoy the book.  There seems to be a driving need on the part of the author to build himself up at the expense of others.  What his statement about how 'all emerging market traders enjoy fine wine and opera', and how 'his interests are more admirable' has to do with \\"Randomness\\" was lost on me.  He claims to be uniquely aware of his flaws as a trader, it's too bad he does not have the same awareness when it comes to his flaws as a human.  It is a shame as I enjoy the subject matter and his style of mathamatical explanations.  If you are someone who is not as bothered by these things as I obviously am, I think the book has many redeeming qualities.  But for me, when I read a book I am spending time with the author, and I have to like him at least a little.
B00008BXJF|5.0|Well, a lot of you disliked _The ConstruKction of Light_ but I think it is one of the best King Crimson albums, a great accomplishment in musical art, and downright profound. At this point I prefer TCOL to _The Power to Believe_ but at the same time I feel comparison is unfair, because I currently feel that perhaps, as a listener, I am too \\"there\\" with the album to fully grasp it. _The ConstruKction of Light_ was released back in 2000 so we have had years to unravel it.<br />Comparison and contrast with past King Crimson albums is most effective with TCOL because it has the same lineup and is similar in many ways. Many of the pieces here were culled from live works before the recording of the album, and they have been carefully developed and adapted to different contexts which expand their effect and power. Sonically, there are also similarities: the instrumental juxtaposition of light (Belew's and Fripp's scintillating guitars) and dark (the deep, brooding bass of Gunn and Mastelotto's grave, hypertight drumming), and a tendency towards fearsome heaviness that would make most prog metal bands weep. Likewise the album's flow: distinct feelings of polar moods. The sequencing is more ambiguous in purpose than TCOL, which was symmetrical in the way it balanced darkness and light. Here, the band has a similar light-dark dynamic but the flow is split up differently, and I do not understand the entire relevance of \\"The Power to Believe\\" theme. However, there is still a sense of unity throughout with thematically macrocompositional tonal centers, althouugh their layout is very complex. The music itself is basically unreal and refers to past Crimson developments -- unfathomable metrical complexity, interlocking guitar dialogue, pointillist rock gamelan, progressive tonality, et cetera.<br />An ethereal a capella intro by Belew disappears into \\"Level Five\\". This is one of the nastiest Crimson tunes EVER, and it's really something everyone has to hear. A tangled yet sensible mesh of multiple tempo and key changes fuels this bulldozer which underscores the brutal essence of the Crimson King (which I'm starting to think is some schizophrenic, infernal angel-demon hybrid). The sublime lyrical element of King Crimson that we hear on \\"One Time\\" or \\"Walking on Air\\" returns from  its TCOL hiatus with \\"Eyes Wide Open\\". This gorgeous piece sounds like Pink Floyd were they to attain divinity. \\"Facts of Life\\" sounds like an evil machine coming to life, with Belew's voice heavily distorted and guitars screeching like twisted metal in a car crash. The weird funky interlude and blaring guitar solo are CRAZY. That Belew was able to make a catchy song out of such evil twisted rock music is amazing. \\"Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With\\" is more machine rock that hides numerous intricacies in its catchy refrains. The chilling instrumental \\"Dangerous Curves\\" flattens me every time with its nerve-racking crescendo, and \\"Elektrik\\" is one of the most ineffably addicting Crim tunes.<br />The recurring \\"The Power to Believe\\" theme takes on a different form each time. The intro is merely Belew's vocorder. \\"The Power to Believe II\\" is one of the most weirdly enchanting King Crimson songs, along with \\"Moonchild\\" and \\"Nuages\\". It is also reminds me of \\"Sartrori in Tangier\\" or \\"The Sheltering Sky\\", which are a like distorted reflections of neoprimitivism. \\"The Power to Believe II\\" similar, a gnarled parallel to music of a more Eastern nature, I suppose. Part III is a ambiance from another plane of existence captured and entombed in steel, and the minimalist, spellbinding coda hangs in the air like a ghost. \\"She carries me through days of apathy   She washes over me   She saved my life in a manner of speaking   When she gave me back the power to believe.\\"<br />Then it is over, satisfying and peaceful, like coming down from a hallucinogenic trip. Your mind feels more vast, like the album has unlocked gateways that remain open even when the music is over. Yet asmuch as I love it now, King Crimson always defies quick judgments, so I still have a ways to go with _The Power to Believe_. In two years, I think I will have come to grasp TPTB more fully, and again see how Fripp & co. are musical leaders and mentors, leading the true ethic of progressive music into the 21st century.much as I love it now, King Crimson always defies quick judgments, so I still have a ways to go with _The Power to Believe_.

B00005JKN9|5.0|Imagine a time when you wake up and that is the best part of your day. Martin Scorsese's immense film, Gangs of NY, is a decent into hell. A trip into a world so very unlike any we've encountered in the 20th century. The brutality is shocking and the way of life even more so. Indeed Mr Scorsese's intentions were to educate and this he does unabashedly. We all know Scorsese's city is New York. From Mean Streets to Age of Innocence, from Bringing out the Dead to Goodfellas, he has explored this city which so enthralls him. Perhaps it is these explorations which led him to Gangs. He had done a period piece based in NYC in Age, but now we're faced with something different. Gangs is a period piece, yes, but unlike any other. It's a period of forgotten time, of a time that was meant to be forgotten. However, Scorsese digs deep. he bases his characters on real-life old-world New Yorkers. Leo DiCaprio's Amsterdam Vallon is our hero. Son of a slain local hero, Vallon is bent on avenging his father's death years later. Enter Bill the Butcher, portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis, the killer of Vallon's father and the true star of the film. Vallon works to gain Bill's trust and does, thus raising questions from the audience as to Vallon's true intentions. The plot is character driven but the scenary is what one must appreciate in this film. The opening shots are, in a word, spectacular. Scorsese recreates 19th century NYC so vividly, you imagine a place like this does exist. Five stars for gutsy, original, and captivating story-telling. The acting of Lewis is bar none and Scorsese's direction will lead you to the edge of your seat. Simply riveting.
B00004XONN|5.0|_OK Computer_ was almost universally the darling of critics, mainstream listeners, and hardcore rock fans alike. _Kid A_, on the other hand, drew wildly varying responses, with a good share of acclaim and derision. In most cases, it probably upset everyone's expectations, whatever they were. _Kid A_ was marketed from the beginning as a daring experiment, which is appropriate given that it is very detached from mainstream sensibilities. For one thing, _Kid A_ is barely even rock music. Instead, this release is dominated by electronics that have an almost threatening austerity. The stuttered \\"Idioteque\\" and the hypnotic, chiming title track in particular are cool slabs of electronic concrete, with elusive, blurry melodies. Thom Yorke's vocals sounds like they are being voiced without conscious effort, a vague mumble where most words are indistinct (no help from the band either -- the CD booklet has no lyrics). The music is heavily processed and cold, simulating a stark, abandoned mood even though Radiohead's distinctive textural quality is unfurled more than ever.<br />So it's not really rock. We could ask \\"Um, what is it?\\" but the question isn't necessarily important. Coming from a *rock* band, it's very...different, but it is still Radiohead at the core. It is an absorbing experience, paranoid and lonely and emotional -- there seems to be a story being told, yet it resolves itself on some weird dimension that makes it difficult to realize. This is reinforced by the sonic atmosphere of _Kid A_ -- what is Yorke mumbling? what instruments are making these sounds? what sort of structures do these songs have? Although, maybe that's the point -- the album title, according to Yorke, refers to the first human clone. \\"Everything Is In Its Right Place\\" -- opening the album with like some electroencephalograph going out-of-whack; cold, abstract synthesizer zigzagging about and \\"b'bluh bluh b'b'bluh\\" being whimpered -- frames a feeling of confusion as a produced clone child awakens. The milieu is confusing, just as the album's sound is contrary to one's confidence, just like the sable soundscapes of \\"Morning Bell\\" are concurrently claustrophobic and vast. When the album gets under your skin, it can be pretty fun to listen to. \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" is a beautiful piece of icy gossamer strains that floats along a silvery current, one of the most pleasant ballads I can think of; the pulpy funk in \\"The National Anthem\\" collapses before a bufuddled, atonal brass section (i like that kind of stuff); \\"Idioteque\\"'s urgent, polar techno is very catchy even though I haven't got a clue what Yorke is saying.<br />_Kid A_ is not perfect, but beautiful, artistic, challenging, and in the end very worthwhile.

B000007T1M|1.0|Totally disappointed ! Its for sale although its so BADDDDDD' I really should SMASH it with a 'jackhammer'. They are laughing ALL the way to the bank. DON'T buy it...:(
B000092ZYX|2.0|Don't get me wrong...this is a good album. But, it falls short of the great albums that started from the Bends to this point. I enjoy the music ....but it falls flat compared to those. The highlights are There There, Where I End, ScatterBrain, A Wolf at the Door, Sail to the Moon & I'll throw in 2+2. But they are few and far between and not as soul stirring as their other work. The low spot of the disc was We Suck young Blood- A boring ditty that contains about 10 seconds of genius during a tempo break, otherwise your stuck with some clapping and not so good ramblings.<BR>This is actually a 3 Star review..but it needed to be a notch down to drop the hype reviews.
B0000020C4|5.0|I saw the performance of Les Miserables on Broadway last year and couldn't imagine a recording whose performances could come close to the performance of the actor who played Valjean <BR>(embarrassed that I cannot recall his name).  He was absolutely awesome.  Well, this one does it for me - not only is Colm Wilkinson outstanding(believe it or not the Broadway actor was every bit as good), but the performances of the other lead actors and actresses are far superior to what I saw and heard in person.   Ruthie Henshall's Fantine brings tears to your eyes, and Lea Solonga, a favorite from &quot;The King and I&quot; with Julie Andrews, does the best &quot;On My Own&quot; I have ever heard - without a doubt a MUST OWN for any Les Miz fan, or for that matter any audiophile with taste for great music.
B000092ZYX|5.0|i am suprised people have given it such bad reveiws. after listening to radiohead album a 100 times i have recognized that they are back. i have to saw that \\"A Wolf At The Door\\" is the best song on the album.this cd is not as good as the bends. almost as good as ok computer. it is better still that pablo, amestic, and kid a. i have to say that backdrifts and gloaming ruined the album. but the album is better then most of ok computer.<BR>1. 2+2=5- 10/10<BR>2.

0385504209|3.0|A fun read, and a tremendous stylistic improvement over his earlier, mind-numbing \\"Digital Fortress\\", which was too reminiscent of the (very) early Michener.  But, inexcusable factual errors show up a bit too early; on page 36, read:<br />\\"As a young astronomy student, Langdon had been stunned to learn the planet Venus traced a perfect pentacle across the ecliptic sky every four years.\\"<br />Not so! The Venus synodic cycle of five (5) equidistant occultations occuring each 584 days, or 1.6 years, takes eight (8) years to complete -- 8/5 = 1.6, approximating the mathematical ratio 1.618, labelled Phi, also known as the \\"Golden Mean\\"...<br />But it is a fun read.
B00006JDSI|5.0|There are a number of versions of the original Murnau film \\"Nosferatu\\" floating around out there, and as a big fan of the film, I've bought most of them and will discuss them so that you don't have to waste time and money trying to decide which to buy. Unfortunately, I am only going to compare the current DVD releases however, and only those in my part of the globe - Region 1. By all means, avoid the embarrassingly bad VHS version with the modern score by \\"Type-O-Negative\\".<br />This is a black & white silent film for those who don't know. Sound wasn't invented for another five years after this film was made and color wasn't introduced for another ten to twelve after that. Bram Stoker's widow successfully had most copies of this film destroyed by infringement of copyright during the twenties, so the few existing prints today are sadly in poor condition. Most films in the silent era were color-tinted, and rarely viewed as pure black & white (so don't put all the blame on Ted Turner for starting that trend). As there was no soundtrack in those days, live orchestras performed the music behind the film. Today, if the original score is not known, (as is the case with Nosferatu), then we try and \\"fake it\\" with a modern composition recorded onto the cassette, laserdisc, or DVD. Some modern scores are fitting and appropriate, while others just stink (such as the Type-O-Negative score). The other problem with older films is that projectors weren't standardized yet, so people produced films at all sorts of different \\"running speeds\\". Today, all film is photographed at 24 frames a second, but back then it was 20, 18, 30, whatever...this is why many films of that era, when translated to present day film, run speedy like a bad episode of the \\"Keystone Cops\\".<br />Basically, there are only two DVD versions available that you should consider if you are at all serious about adding this legendary classic to your home collection.<br />First, there's the IMAGE Entertainment version, which has two musical scores: one score is kind of lame and silly, while the second organ score is the better of the two. The DVD in tinted brightly as well. The real gem on this version is an outstanding commentary soundtrack by a German film expert that is so educational.<br />Second, is the best version available, which is produced by Kino. This version has the sharper picture, a slightly better running speed and contains a few scenes not seen in other version (Kino's is also the longest running version available). The Kino version also comes with two scores. The first score is my favorite available and would be perfect if not for a few \\"vocal\\" improvisations of a woman gasping when the actress onscreen is scared. It's embarrassing and cheezy. The second score is a completely inappropriate \\"techno\\" version that sounds more like a cheap Nine-Inch-Nails rip-off and doesn't fit the film at all. (I don't understand why people insist on giving this film a modern musical score to emphasize it's horror aspects when all they do is demean it). The Kino version sadly does not have a commentary track or it would be perfect. The Kino version is also color-tinted. I would personally like to see a version without color-tinting as I just find that annoying.<br />But as of this date, June 2003, the Kino version of the original 1922 Nosferatu is the one to buy. But if you want the wonderful commentary soundtrack, then go with the IMAGE Entertainment version instead.hich has two musical scores: one score is kind of lame and silly, while the second organ score is the better of the two.

B000002J09|4.0|This is an awsome album but it is far from being Led Zeppelins best album, though it is probly their most popular.<br />-Black Dog, has a cool blues swagger about it that your sure to love and has a way cool guitar riff! 5/5<br />-Rock And Roll, is just that a great hard rock and roll song with great drumming and one of Jimmy Pages best guitar riffs ever! 5/5<br />-The Battle Of The Evermore, it will take a couple of listens but you'll get it 3/5<br />-Stairway To Heaven, I know you have heard it 400 times so I dont need to say anything and if you havent all you need to know is that it has one of Jimmy Pages best solos and killer drumming by Bonzo and some of Robert Plants best lyrics! 5/5<br />-Misty Mountain Hop, Its a great song but its one of the weaker tracks on the album because there really is nothing special about this song 3/5<br />-Four Sticks, this song is awsome I love this song with every fiber of my bean! And John Paul Jones' basss playing is at the top of his game 5/5<br />-Going To California, shows why Robert Plant has such a good voice! 5/5<br />-When the Leave Breaks, this song alone show why Bonzo (John Bonham) is the greatest drummer in the world!<br /> So you have heard ever one of these songs on the classic rock, and hard rock radio stations and you know you love them so pick up this album!

When I first bought this album, I let my dad borrow it(He and I both are Jazz and blues lovers). He's absolutely crazy about it! Even my step witch who hates jazz loves this album! Norah Jones has extremely good talent! I wish I could play the piano as well as she does! I even think she's better at that than Vanessa Carlton!

B00008LDPU|4.0|Animatrix is a welcome twist in the Matrix series.  Those of us who are the true fans of Matrix world will find this series of episodes to be a creative elaboration on the concept of the Matrix universe.  It could also be a device used by Warchovski's to keep our hunger to see Matrix Revolutions at bay.<br />   While some episodes are free standing, Kid's Story and Final Flight of Osiris are intimately linked to the events of the Matrix: Reloaded.  Those of us who loved the Matrix have to admit; the idea of machines creating an artificial reality is a great one.  Warchowski's were not the first ones to come up with the idea of dream skepticism but their execution of it makes for a fascinating concept.  The idea of the Matrix is filled with mystery, danger, fear, and much of unknown and unexplored.  <br />The use of the animation was a great idea to address some of the plot holes of the Matrix series as well as to create more entertainment for those of us who want to see Matrix without Keanu Revees.  What makes Animatrix a good DVD is that it incorporates nine wholly different stories and styles of presentation.  While some will dislike particular episode or episodes most of us will walk away with at least one element or a story as profoundly touching.  In other words, you might not like all, but at least something here.<br />   As for myself, there are two particular episodes I loved.  They are Matriculated and Program.  Even though both of these episodes do not seem to appeal to general liking I find them particularly profound.  Matriculated is very abstract piece and unlike some other episodes its message is not spoon feed directly to the audience.  The visual imagery was stunning and memorable and was intended to make us come up with our own interpretations of what seemed bizarre.  Perhaps Matriculated yields a hint at what will happen in Matrix Revolutions, I can't wait.

B00000DC10|5.0|just like everyone else that wrote a review i have to say that this album is amazing. i bought this when it came out and am only now rediscovering it. amazing. this is some fist clenching hardcore. but not empty hardcore. think of rage against the machine politics, or dare i say even more radical than RATM. but this album also has some amazing mellow songs such as \\"apollo\\" which features a squeeze organ and the song tannhauser which has a violin. either way you get this album youll like it. eventually. you need a right mindset. i listen to this when i need to focus on some intese project. i also recomend the (international) noise conspiracy. lead singer from refused in a more poppy less hard core version of refeused<br />cheers

6304696566|5.0|The Searchers is considered by many to be one of the best westerns ever made, and I cannot disagree with them.  The story follows the efforts of two men trying to track down a kidnapped girl from Comanches over the course of five years.  The men tracking the tribe are a Confederate veteran and the girl's uncle and the other a family friend and also part Cherokee.  The film is beautifully shot as all John Ford westerns are, which adds to the overall mood of the movie.  There is a vastness to some scenes which show the futility of tracking down this girl after so many years.  The Searchers is a classic that provided John Wayne with a role that was different from any other he had previously played.<br />  John Wayne stars as Ethan Edwards, the Confederate veteran trying to track down his niece after his brother's family is slaughtered by a Comanche raiding party.  He plays the role of the racist veteran to perfection.  At times it is startling to see him in a role that differs so greatly from most other movies he had done.  Jeffrey Hunter plays Martin Pawley, the Duke's partner in his search for the kidnapped girl. He plays a good sidekick to Wayne throughout since they have such differing personalities in the movie.  Also starring are Natalie Wood, Ward Bond, Harry Carey JR, Patrick Wayne, Hank Worden, Ken Curtis and plenty of other Wayne stock actors.  The DVD is good but could have been much better.  You can view the movie in fullscreen or widescreen, with trailers included alongside four documentary shorts.  A must have for western fans that is up there with Shane and The Wild Bunch as some of the greatest westerns of all time!
0007158998|5.0|The &quot;SAS Survival Handbook&quot; is the most comprehensive survival handbook I have ever seen.  Most books have some basic advice (the importance of the correct mental attitude, finding water and shelter, etc.), a handful of edible plants, and a couple of ways to start a fire.  While this book covers all those areas, it also has sections on camp craft, determining directions, rescue signals, dealing with different climates and terrains, reading clouds for weather prediction, and many others.  A good example of the thoroughness of the coverage would be the food section.  It covers your energy needs and how they are met from various foods, testing unknown plants in desperate situations, plants to avoid, identification of plants, using animals for food, extensive and detailed trapping mechanisms, fishing, gutting and cleaning, and other advice.  The number, types, and detail on the various traps are amazing.  I've never seen so many different designs.  It includes several that I have not seen anywhere else before.  I would consider this the authoritative text on survival skills in the wild and give it the highest recommendation for anyone interested in survival techniques.
B00004RF9B|4.0|Leslie Nielsen as the captain of intrepid purebred horny spacemen ? Robbie the Robot ? A long-lost civilization ? This romp to planet Altair, besieged by an unknown evil force, is unbelievably hilarious for its pulp and sixties sensibility. The movie always threatens to morph into a weird episode of some sixties sitcom with a name like \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" in outer space. Bonus points for having a story that actually makes sense and manages to be interesting, despite the movie being hilarious. Definitively to watch if you love bad movies.
B000083C49|5.0|Star Trek IV Review<br />With the success of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, writer-producer Harve Bennett and director Leonard Nimoy were given the green light by Paramount to wrap up the storyline that began with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.  There were several plot strands left to tie up, after all, what with Spock having to be re-educated and Kirk and his crew facing a court-martial for the actions they took in the rescue of their half-Vulcan comrade.<br />Set barely three months after the events of the third film, Star Trek IV opens with a mysterious alien probe cruising toward the Terran system. Its passage immobilizes any starship it passes as it inexorably makes its way to Earth.<br />Meanwhile, on Vulcan, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) hurriedly undergoes retraining of his mind. In a wonderfully written scene, the former Enterprise science officer breezes through the quizzes a computer tosses at him until he is stumped by the question \\"How do you feel?\\"<br />Spock's human mother, Amanda (Jane Wyatt, reprising her role from The Original Series' \\"Journey to Babel\\") hears the computer repeating the question over and over and sidles over to her son. \\"What's wrong?\\"<br />\\"I do not understand the question, Mother,\\" says a puzzled Spock.<br />Amanda explains that the retraining of Spock's mind has been in the Vulcan way, but that the computer knows that Spock is half-human, and that his feelings will surface.  Spock is skeptical about the concept of having human emotions (since in the series he strived to be more Vulcan-than-thou), but his mother explains that he is alive at that moment because his friends acted out of their emotional nature, disregarding the \\"logic\\" of simply obeying Starfleet orders and refraining from fetching Spock from the Genesis planet.<br />On Earth, the Klingon ambassador (John Schuck) warns the Federation that there will be no peace while Kirk remains alive and unpunished for stealing the Klingon Bird-of-Prey and defeating its crew (preventing Cmdr. Kruge from obtaining the secrets of Genesis).  The Federation president promises there will be a court martial, but the Klingons scoff at this.<br />Even as the Enterprise crew - aboard their stolen Klingon vessel -  races home to face the consequences of their actions, the alien probe arrives.  Sending a signal to Earth's ocean, it disrupts the planet's climate, causing chaos and world-wide disasters.<br />The Voyage Home had a tortuous development.  At first, the original screenplay by Peter Krikes and Steve Meerson focused on a time travel story tailor-made for guest star Eddie Murphy.  Fans heard about this and - as with the death of Spock and the destruction of the Enterprise - protested.  Paramount also resisted the idea of mixing two of the studio's franchises, so Murphy and Star Trek never did mix.  There was also some nasty behind-the-scenes wrangling about the screenplay, because the Krikes-Meerson version was heavily rewritten by Nicholas Meyer and Harve Bennett - an incident overlooked in the documentaries and commentaries. Eventually the original writers won shared credit for the screenplay, and The Voyage Home was released in the summer of 1986.  Notably, this more light-hearted film had major crossover appeal, charming not only Star Trek fans, but also wider audiences.<br />With its clever script and wonderful mix of sci-fi adventure, social commentary, comedy, romance, and drama, Star Trek IV became the most popular entry of the 10 movies made between 1979 and 2002.<br />This Collector's Edition offers one disc with the theatrical cut of the movie, enhanced with a new menu, Dolby surround sound, a commentary track by director Leonard Nimoy and actor William Shatner, plus a text commentary by Star Trek Encyclopedia authors Mike and Denise Okuda.  The second disc comes with the usual documentaries, interviews, and the theatrical trailer.enting Cmdr. Kruge from obtaining the secrets of Genesis).

0671027344|5.0|The ending (last 2 pages) made me want to shake the bee-jeezes out of Charlie. The fact he feels no hatred, no anger, no \\"woo-is-me\\" emotions makes me catch my breath. I will not ruin the ending for you, but two sentences in the near end really got to me. Maybe it was how calm he seem. This is no \\"Sex, sex, sex\\" sterotypical teenage boy. Charlie is far more complex than that. He goes through things that many adults don't want to believe happens. Being a teenager in high school myself, it shocked me how realistic this was. I've never read a book that stated \\"I'm up to ten cigarettes a day,\\" so openly. Usually, people try to tiptoe around those topics like some taboo.<br />If you want a glimpse at the real world of a teen, read this. I'm not saying we're all a bunch of potheads, but things like that happens. Believe me.

Perfect for a rainy day...or any day for that matter.
0792839730|4.0|A Bridge Too Far is a huge epic movie detailing the preparation and execution of the biggest paratrooper invasion in history, Operation Market Garden.  In an effort to end the war sooner, the Allied High Command plans an attack that will drop thousands of paratroopers behind enemy lines and then send the armour in to meet up with them and take over several strategic German positions.  The film does at times try to do to much, but it still maintains a sense of reality and how futile the whole plan actually was. There are excellent action sequences, fairly graphic for the time, very good cast, and a musical score that will stick in your head for several days.<br /> A Bridge Too Far boasts an excellent cast full of big name stars.  The movie stars Dirk Bogarde, James Caan, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Edward Fox, Elliott Gould, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, Hardy Kruger, Laurence Olivier, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford, Maximilian Schell and Liv Ullmann.  While all of them are pretty good, James Caan sticks out as the sergeant who promises his lieutenant that he won't let him die, and Anthony Hopkins as the leader of the paratroopers trapped in Arnhem.  Based on the novel by Cornelius Ryan, this is a very good movie that does succeed in doing many things that it set out to do.  The DVD is very good with widescreen presentation, original theatrical trailer, and an 8-page booklet included.  Excellent World War II epic!  Check it out!<br /> Also, look for John Ratzenberger, Cliff from Cheers, in a small role as one of Robert Redford's men.  Look fast because he doesn't survive for very long.
B00006X06U|2.0|I love Joni to death, but find this album just plain unfocused and messy. Many of the obscure and \\"undiscovered\\" tracks revisted her from Don Juan and Mingus remain as contrived and just plain weird as the original recordings. Also, instead of enhancing the material, the orchestral arrangements tend to suck the life out of the songs, the result being great classics such as Hejira and The Sire of Sorrow feel weighed down and hampered. Also, I don't feel Joni's sincerity on this release. Only on the last song, \\"The Circle Game,\\" did I connect with the music, and feel she had truly \\"recreated\\" one of her songs. Not worth the price of admission, though.

B000002KHF|5.0|Moondance is one of my favorite Van Morrison albums, a classic on a level with Astral Weeks and Tupelo Honey. There's a moving description of the numinous experience in the song And It Stoned Me which recounts an experience with a childhood friend. The playful arrangement of the title track with its jazzy infusions celebrates a different kind of magic. His voice turns tender and subdued for the gentle love song Crazy Love but goes into full R&amp;B mode for the soulful Caravan. Every note seems to be in exactly the right place on this masterpiece of an album with its exquisite arrangements whilst the words are sheer poetry, as in the yearning Into The Mystic. Slower songs like Mystic and faster ones like the buoyant ditty Come Running alternate with great effect. Every composition is special and memorable, whether it's a love song like These Dreams Of You or a more overtly devotional piece like Brand New Day. The poetic lyrics, evocative melodies and Van's varied vocal styles all contribute to the sonic splendour of Moondance.
B000092ZYX|3.0|From the first listens of this album I didnt really get hooked.  After subsequent listens I could start to see that this album wasnt as great as their previous stuff.  The rumour is that this album took a little over a week to record, and it shows.  But some people like that about albums, I however do not.  I like albums that are intricate and complex (i.e. Ok Computer, Kid A).  This album, although it sounds nothing like the bends, it not complex or intricate much like that album.  Most of this album is strictly pop music.  The first 3 tracks are the only ones worth mentioning.  But the album falters after them, and no other tracks equals their greatness.  To me, Radiohead started out going in the so-called 'ambient' direction with Ok Computer.  They then furthered it with Kid A and Amnesiac.  What I would have liked to see is a full blown epic ambient Radiohead album, now that would be something!
B000005RS0|5.0|Tina Turner's classic album from 1984 has been substantially enhanced with the addition of seven tracks, including wonderful extended versions of What's Love Gotta Do With It, Better Be Good To Me and I Can't Stand The Rain. This makes Private Dancer even more of an essential album as it remains Turner's masterpiece from the eighties, an album of brilliant material<br />exquisitely interpreted. It's a concept album loosely based on a stripper's life and it amply showcases Tina Turner's multifaceted talents. The bitter What's Love Got To Do With It and the melancholy title track, both passionate ballads, were massive hits. Better Be Good To Me and Steel Claw are scorching rockers while she really adds a new dimension to her covers of Help and Let's Stay Together, another top 10 hit. I love Tina's interpretation of the Anne Peebles song I Can't Stand The Rain which was also a hit for Eruption way back in 1978. Private Dancer is a triumph of epic proportions, not only Turner's comeback album but a timeless masterpiece of exceptional songs infused with enough raunch to please her hardcore fans from the early days and enough pop appeal for the mainstream. Never before had her voice been wrapped around such quality but accessible and melodic material as on Private Dancer, making for a consistently enjoyable album with broad appeal. This reissue with the extra tracks is superb value for money - get it!
B00006RAKP|4.0|Let us start with with this: If you do not like Elton John, then you must not like music. Elton may not be my personal favorite artist either, but when you begin to wonder which popular songs of the 20th century have the potential to live forever, there's absolutely no doubt...THIS is the man!!!<br />The one thing which knocks this disc down from a perfect score was the over-emphasis of the late 80's-to-present music. To think that some of his classic oldies had to be left out just to make room for newer, lesser known tracks was not just disappointing, but also contradictory to the CD title itself. Elton has written some fine music in recent years, but we all know it isn't nearly at the same caliber as when he was younger.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This band has wowed me . I was so anxious to hear what the next album would be like . After animation , i was missing the rock side of this band . They pulled this record off great , it has all the creativeness that is Linkin Park . The first album will always be the classic one but this one is good for a third album . Allot of bands fall off track when they release more albums but Linkin Park has stayed true to the game , they are unique and the music is growing . I wonder whats next to come :) ... I find myself wanting more songs , they make such great songs .I can hear the pain in the music and it reminds me of many memories .  here whats going in the cd in a nutshell ...you may want the cd to sound like the first but it doesnt really hold that feeling you get from the variety the first cd had . Though each song on this cd has been done very well , i dont have a least liked song . If i had to pick my least liked song it would be the one they play on mtv , not cuase i dislike mtv or anything but i hear it too many times on the radio/mtv.My favorite song is ''its easier to run'' track .. not sure exactley what to say , this is just how i feel .pick up this cd and expand your horizens .
0312955006|5.0|The Concrete Blonde is about the fifth Michael Connelly work I have read and while I have loved them all--this one is definitely the best I have read so far.  This is the third installment in the Harry Bosch chronicles and is a court room drama and police procedural rolled into one, complete with terrific dialogue, an excellent plot and expert pacing.  Before this series opened, Harry took out the Dollmaker, a notorious LA serial killer.  Harry is now on trial, in civil court, accused of violating the civil rights of the murderer.  During the trial, evidence surfaces that causes Harry to doubt whether he shot the wrong man--could the Dollmaker still be at large?  Connelly handles this story quite well, weaving the stories of the trial and the criminal investigation seamlessly.  This is a well-done escape.  Enjoy.
B000092ZYX|5.0|You are greeted by an electric hum, the supposed sound of Johnny Greenwood; Radiohead's resident gifted multi instrumentalist/ weird noise maker, plugging in his guitar on the first day of the bands two week recording session for their sixth full length lp Hail to the Thief. For 56 minutes you are dragged away to a land of jangling guitars, electronic hums and the bittersweet croons of vocalist Thom Yorke. Ranging from the sonic melancholy of \\"Where I End and You Begin\\" to the chugging bass and tingling guitars of \\"There There\\" \\"Hail to the Thief\\" takes the listener deep into a lush soundscape of psuedo-break beat drums, haunting vocals and weeping electronics. Although the band admits the current bad blood of politics  lingering in the global air influenced the recording, they deny the title itself comes from a popular phrase describing the \\"sweeping\\" victory of George W Bush in the 2000 presidential elections, \\"If the motivation for naming our album had been solely based on the U.S election, I'd find that to be pretty shallow.\\" Yorke explains, \\"To me it's about forces that aren't necessarily human, forces that are creating in this climate of fear. While making this record, I became obsessed with how certain people are able to inflict this incredible pain on others while believing they're doing the right thing. They're taking people's souls before their even dead. I was just overcome with all this fear and darkness. And that fear is the `Thief'.\\" The `fear', of which Yorke speaks manifests itself quite clearly, in fact,\\"Hail to the Thief\\" is chock full of that good `ole satirical doom we have all come to love and except from Yorke and company. Sound wise, the album is a leap back to the more formal math rock format of Ok Computer, still, the album is still shrouded in the electronic blips and moody synthesizers that dominated of the band's twin 2000 releases Kid A and Amnesiac. Yorke attributes this mainly to the band learning how to play electronic material live.\\"It was the tension between what's human and what's coming from the machines. That was the stuff we were getting into.\\".  At times the instruments on \\"Hail to the Thief\\" seem to be dueling with one another, friction creating static, static creating a sonically charged wall of sound that sparks the senses. \\"Hail to the Thief\\" possesses a kind of raw energy and sarcastic anger that we haven't seen from Radiohead in years, and no one is arguing that it is back. \\"Hail to the Thief\\" opens with the track \\"2+2=5\\", a title ripped straight from the pages of George Orwell's 1984. Yorke sings in a sugary falsetto, \\"It's the devils way now, there is no way out\\" moments later he transmogrifies into a tea drinking English Jello Biafra screaming, \\"Because you have not been paying attention!\\". \\"Hail to the Thief\\" plays out like a tectonic plate on speed, rapidly switching from one thought to the next, one sound eaten by another. Drummer Phil Selway's beats sound as if they have been carefully arranged, ripped to shreds, then looped back together again and  Yorke's lyrics are fragmented. He never fully states his point, he only implies that it exists, leaving the listener to decide for themselves what the meaning is. The song \\"Myxomatosis\\" (the european virus created to dwindle the swelling rabbit population in the 1950's)  is narrated by a \\"Mongrel cat holding half a head\\" who speaks of the distortions of the media amidst industrial synthesizers and pulsing drums. In the song \\"Sit down, stand up\\" Yorke barks nonsense orders, then, accompanied by a drum machine, proceeds to repeats the phrase \\"and the raindrops\\" 46 times. \\"I just liked the way it sounded.\\" is his explanation. <BR> Dripping with, delicious ambiguity, haunting melodies,  schizophrenic love songs, and warm feedback Radiohead's \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is the grayish light cutting through all the emo-rock-rap-bubble-gum-poppy-punk noise that seems to have crowded the music industry. A complex album with layers upon layers ofsound and meaning, \\"Hail to the Thief\\" may take a few listens before any deeper meaning can be pulled from it's jumbled content. This, however, is what makes it such a spectacular album. It's meanings can change to suit the listener. We are all allowed to take away what is pertinent to our own lives. The obscurity of the material leaves it wide open for interruption. So maybe we still don't completely understand it, but, by God, we appreciate it.
B000093BDX|5.0|Beach Boy fans who've walked past collections from three 60s best-ofs to &quot;Endless Summer&quot; in the 1970s to two sets of re-release two-fers, box and rarity sets as countless as sands on the seashore....finally have their ultimate one-disc greatest hits. &quot;Sounds of Summer&quot; gives the Beach Boys a comprehensive hits collection to rest beside hisorical rock figures from Elvis to the Beatles to Elton John.<br />Attractively packaged and sequenced, &quot;Sounds of Summer&quot;  features a cool, sweet but ultimately vanilla Anthony de Curtis essay. (Beach Boy historians David Leaf and Mark Elliot have written better mini-histories of the band on other compilations.)  Ultimately, these three-minute West Coast symphonies and California mimi vacations (&quot;Surfin USA,&quot; &quot;Sloop John B,&quot; &quot;California Girls,&quot; &quot;I Get Around&quot;) at least retain some freshness more than 40 years later.<br />It's the hits, nothing but. Longtime Beach Boy fans could easily name a favorite &quot;Endless Summer&quot; or other LP track missing here. But like &quot;Beatles 1&quot; and &quot;Elvis' 30 Greatest Hits,&quot; this Beach Boys set ultimately introduces the band's legendary singles to the youngest music fans, many of whom were just learning to wade when &quot;Kokomo&quot; topped the charts in 1988. Buy &quot;Sounds of Summer&quot; for your children who can't wait for June, then buy &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; for yourself to prepare for their adolescence.
B00007BK2N|5.0|Great movie, it chronicles both the birth and death of Joy Division and the start of the rave scene, both of whitch happened in Manchester, England over the course of a few years.  If you like that kooky Brit humor, are a New Order/Joy Division fan, and you want to see how the rave scene was born, get this movie.

0679777547|4.0|The Club Dumas isn't your typical mystery.  Lucas Corso isn't your typical detective.  So if you would enjoy something outside of the formulic mystery genre this novel will keep you reading late into the night.  I couldn't put this book down.  Like the main character Lucas Corso, I just kept getting more into the \\"game\\" as the story went on.  Arturo Perez-Reverte has created an intriguing novel about about the world of antique booksellers and dealers. The reader is treated to details about the literary world and the quirky people who inhabit it.  Lucas Corso describes himself as a literary mercenary who could possibly sell his soul to get the best aquisition.  We follow him as he begins the story helping his only friend Flavio Lapont by authenticating a manuscript written by Dumas himself.  Simultaneously, he is hired by a client to verify the fact that the book The Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows is a forgery.  Somehow these missions become intertwined as Corso's life becomes enmeshed in the mystery of the Dumas manuscript \\"The Three Musketeers\\" and the satanic significance of the Nine Doors novel.  During his quest, Corso encounters a mysterious female  and various characters that he names after characters from the \\"Three Musketeers.\\"  As the mysteries become more sinister and life threatening the pace picks up and the reader is swept into the bizarre world of the people who hold the other copies of the Nine Doors book and the simultaneously flowing plot about the Dumas manuscript.  This isn't a light read but heavy on inferences with an ending that may leave some unsatisfied. I loved the detailed story with the references to historical facts interwoven with fantasy about the devil.  An excellent novel.

B000089RVX|5.0|Very Gothic, Dark and yet extremely powerful and uplifting.  I just bought this CD and liked every song on it the first time I listened to it.  Now that I have listened to it several times I absolutely love it.  This Amy Lee has a very powerful voice that ranges from very dark gothic to melodic.  I hear and feel a lot of Tori Amos and an occasional Ozzie Osborne style.  It's nice to buy a CD and love every song and this one falls into that category.  If you love the piano as I do and well orchestrated music, and great female voice then you should like this as well.
B00000IMCW|1.0|This movie was soo gory! Not that I care that it's gory, it's just that the blood was more orangish yellow than red. The acting was weak and the special effects that everyone is raving about is pathetic. They even used the same dead people throughout the film that already got blown up!!My advice is to skip this cheesey horror flick.
6303534422|5.0|The last time I'd seen this was back in 8th grade. I just recently found the video in my old closet while unpacking a bunch of clothes, and I decided to watch it. Now I'm going into 12th grade, and man, I can't believe I still find this movie enjoyable! I remembered when I first saw this movie, I noticed that Max and the problems he had to go through were just like me and my problems. Like Max, I thought my dad was embarrasing, and I kinda resembled Max in a strange way. Heck, I even thought(and kinda still do) that Roxanne was cute! XD<BR> But anyway, the movie is still funny after all these years; especially the songs. There was a particular scene were Max, thanks to his father Goofy, gets dragged into some little kid show that stars some old run-down opossum robots, that was pretty funny. And it kinda contradicted that Disneyland ride, 'It's a Small World'. The animation was okay, and the story had enough gags to keep you interested, especially if you're a kid. Though there are some parts that seem overly sappy, like when Goofy and Max get stuck down a canyon on their car. Either way, this movie is AT LEAST a rental if you're not sure abuot buying it; and if you've ever seen this when you were a kid, it'd be nice to revisit some old memories, wouldn't it?
B000092ZYX|5.0|With this album Thom Yorke and his band show us their full maturity, as the Beatles did with the White Album. Radiohead play their songs in complete harmony: they create a perfect alchemy and Yorke is one of the most passionate, inspired singers of the last 50 years. The first track, \\"2+2=5\\", is a very powerful musical explosion: with this song, the band tells us that R'n'R is not dead-but it isn't Bill Haley any more. The world changes and music reflects its growing inhumanity. HTTT is not only about politics and corruption: it is a poetical analysis of human condition. There are bitter critics about social problems, but there never is the immaturity of \\"Electioneering\\": lyrics always are imaginative and each line has several meanings. The band reaches incredible heights of lyricism with tracks like \\"Sail to the moon\\", \\"I will\\", \\"A punchup at a wedding\\". \\"We suck young blood\\" is, in my opinion, one of the most interesting songs: it is simple like a traditional ballad and you can hear echoes from Kurt Weill's music. In this song, the rhythm is emphasized by slow claps that create a gloomy atmosphere, as if we were on a slave ship. Electronic sounds, electric guitars, croons and shouts mix together and the result is an impressive and intense album: a great masterpiece. When you listen to these songs, you reflect on the tangled catacombs of modern life and on the unfathomable abyss of subconscious. The music speaks for itself: this is a great work of art.

0671027387|5.0|It's been quite some time since I've read a book as tight, exciting, and twisty as Deception Point. I think the last author to bowl me over so quickly was Dean Koontz (his early years, not now). This novel has just about everything you need for a stay-up-all-night read and absolutely nothing you don't need. It's very well-paced, and I swear this is one of the hardest books to put down. Until I read his debut novel, Digital Fortress, and was bowled over again by this new author. He just has a knack for getting you hooked right from the start and not weighing you down with a lot of character development until you're ready. And by this I mean he doesn't spend the first 50-100 pages introducing the main players and boring the socks off of you like a lot of authors do now. He gradually unveils each character over the course of the novel, so like in real life, you get to know them over a period of time. Dan Brown reminds me so much of when Koontz used to write like this, but now all his books are all about the character, and the action, plot, and narrative are secondary. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for character development, but I simply can't remember all there is to know about a person when 50 pages are devoted to them back to back. Just doesn't work, at least for me.<br />So, read the plot outline above, and if sounds like a genre that will appeal to you, give it a go. I will say that Dan Brown can take the most complicated subject matter and boil it down into something completely understandable. And when I look up some of the things he writes about, I find that all his plot devices are based in fact. How refreshing! So when his prologue or author's note says such-and-such are real places and/or devices, believe him. This is one author who does his homework, and the reader is the beneficiary of all this knowledge. You will walk away from his books feeling completely refreshed, not ripped off, and ready to find his next little gem tucked away somewhere on Amazon!
B00004Z459|5.0|So ur contemplating on buying Hybrid Theory. You say well it is the best selling record of 2001 maybe I should buy it. But I don't want to jump on the bandwagon. Maybe it's not all that good. Well let me tell you this, It's no strange phenomena that Hybrid Theory is one of the highest selling albums ever. Many people don't like rap and it's understandable. It's not everyone's cup of tea. But Hybrid Theory PERFECTLY blends the rock and the rap. I don't like placing Linkin Park in this \\"nu-metal\\" category for they are in a league of their own. Mike Shindoa and Chester Bennington are polar opposites of each other both muscially and physically and it's the contrast between them that makes it work. I could go into detail about each track and why they are so awesome, but Linkin Park's music is not one to be justified through words, but rather through emotions, and unless you can feel what I feel. GO BUY THE CD!!!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|In the mid 80s I lost interest in rock music - it all seemed derivative and boring. It was then that I discovered jazz and I didn't buy a rock album for 15 years. A couple of years ago I heard jazz pianist Brad Mehldau play Radiohead covers (Exit Theme and Paranoid Android)so I bought OK Computer. What a revelation! OK -I can do without the teenage angst lyrics, but the music is wonderful. Now I've come back I hope some Radiohead listeners give Brad Mehldau a try.
B00003CXXM|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw \\"The Bourne Identity.\\" Having never read the book or seen the TV miniseries, I knew little about the premise. In addition, I wasn't sure how well Matt Damon would do playing an action hero.<br />What I saw was an excellent movie with a great cast and terrific acting.<br />Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, an amnesiac who knows his name only because it was on a passport he found with his picture on it. He doesn't know where he has been, where he lives, or what he does for a living. The only thing he knows is that he found a safety deposit box that belongs to him with tens of thousands of dollars of money, several more passports, and a gun. Oh yeah.... and people keep trying to kill him.<br />Although the movie starts a little on the slow side (which was necessary to set up the premise), once it gets started it keeps going with barely a chance to catch your breath.<br />Another reason to like this movie: the director did not mess it up by inserting a pointless and unneeded love sequence. Yes, you know the two main characters will get together at some point. However, once we see that they are going to get together, we don't see them going at it. No scenes of them falling into bed together, and no scenes of them waking up together the next morning. More movies need to comprehend the idea of less is more.<br />This DVD Collector's Edition also contains several great extras. One of my favorites is the alternate ending which was apparently filmed and then, wisely, scrapped. In addition, you can view four deleted scenes which had been, also wisely, scrapped, and an extended farmhouse scene. There is also a \\"Making Of\\" commentary in this section.<br />If you are a Matt Damon or an action fan, this is one movie that you are going to want to see.
B00007J5VN|4.0|In 1966, Bob Fosse scored one of his greatest personal triumphs when he directed and choreographed the original Broadway production of &quot;Sweet Charity.&quot;  But when he made his directorial debut with the film version three years later, things didn't go as well.  Most critics felt he wasn't so much an auteur as a kid who'd been unleashed in a cinematic candy store, going overboard with zoom shots, montages, and cross-cuts, basically clobbering the delicate, whimsical tone of his Broadway show with slam-bang, razzle-dazzle overkill.  And despite a few positive reviews, the film failed at the box office; it would be years before any studio gave him the chance to direct another movie - but as we all know, he would rebound with a vengeance, snaring Academy Award nominations for &quot;Lenny&quot; and &quot;All That Jazz,&quot; and winning the Oscar for &quot;Cabaret.&quot;  And now that it's been released on DVD, a second look at &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; is in order.  Were the criticisms directed at the film justified?  In some cases, yes.  Is it worth buying?  Well, if you're a connoisseur of the movie musical - ABSOLUTELY.<br />To start with, you've got some seriously talented women working at peak form here.  Shirley MacLaine may not entirely fill Gwen Verdon's dancing shoes - who could? - but she makes a delightful Charity nonetheless.  If you're looking for proof, simply watch the opening credits; not since Audrey Hepburn in &quot;Breakfast At Tiffany's&quot; has an actress so thoroughly nailed a character in her first few minutes of screen time.  There may be some overly cute moments here and there (for which the director and/or screenwriter must share resposibility), but there's no denying MacLaine gives a very real and touching performance.  As for Chita Rivera, she's so hot in &quot;There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This&quot; she practically burns a hole in the screen.  Paula Kelly has some pretty hot moves too, not to mention a great way with a one-liner (&quot;Oh girl, do you know how many guys are running around this city carrying pocket books?&quot;).  And though Suzanne Charny may not be a household name, she dances her way into silver screen immortality with &quot;Rich Man's Frug&quot; - after you've seen her in this number, I doubt you'll ever forget her (and keep an eye out for a dynamic young Ben Vereen in the ensemble).<br />Which brings us to the musical numbers, most of which are dynamite - which isn't too surprising, considering Fosse was not only a great choreographer, but also a veteran of the hallowed MGM Movie Musical era.  The aforementioned &quot;Rich Man's Frug&quot; and &quot;There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This&quot; are both showstoppers, as are &quot;Big Spender,&quot; &quot;If My Friends Could See Me Now,&quot; and &quot;I'm A Brass Band&quot; (imaginative use of NYC locations like the Brooklyn Bridge, Yankee Stadium, Lincoln Center, and Wall Street make the latter number truly spectacular).  &quot;The Rhythm Of Life&quot; and &quot;I Love To Cry At Weddings&quot; are still a chore to sit through (despite Sammy Davis Jr.'s presence in the former), but with a click of your DVD remote you can easily skip those sequences.<br />Finally, one of the best reasons for buying the &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; DVD is that it contains the film's alternate ending which, as far as I'm concerned, is far superior to the one used in 1969.  I know there are many who feel that concluding the movie with Charity being dumped yet again is truer to the spirit of the Fellini film on which its based (&quot;Nights Of Cabiria&quot;), but using flower children in the finale was a ghastly, self-conscious idea that looked out-of-date within hours of the film's release (at least the Broadway show displayed some wit when Charity encountered the Good Fairy, who turned out to be an advertising plug for a TV show).  Fosse was right in wanting to avoid sentimentality and the happily-ever-after cliche, but I don't think he took into account the unexpectedly strong chemistry between Shirley MacLaine and John McMartin (their courtship scenes are genuinely charming), or how much the audiences wanted Charity to cop a break - even if it didn't last forever.  The alternate ending, therefore, is a suprisingly shrewd one; not only does it add a nice touch of symmetry (with another plunge in the lake), but it manages to bring Charity and Oscar together without creating any illusions about their future.  As the dialogue makes clear:<br />OSCAR: The odds against us are at least a hundred to one.<br />CHARITY: Those are the best odds I ever had.<br />And so they walk off together - maybe for a few months, maybe for a few years, maybe forever - who knows?  But at least they have some hope, and I think they deserve it.  I think the audience deserves it, too.<br />But alternate ending or not - that's your call - &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; is one of the better film musicals you'll find.

B00005OBSD|4.0|If you're a Free fan then this album is a must have. It's their Genesis album, their musical launch pad. Before the hype, before the egos, before the drugs... there was Tons of Sobs. A technically raw album, it provides a fascinating glimpse into the energetic, early potential of this group. The album is a Sgt Pepper's style journey, beginning and ending with the haunting 'Over the Green Hills' Some great performances are wedged in between... Worry, Walk in my shadow, I'm a mover, and the classic Hunter. Kossoff's fluid guitar work, intense vibrato laden lead work dominates while Kirke and Fraser provide a solid musical backing. Rodgers voice is gritty, with his distinctive phrasing punctuating the riff laden tracks. Close your eyes and be transported back to a time when the music and the vibe did the talking...
B000092ZYX|5.0|In Herman Hesse's Siddharta,  Siddharta was looking for enlightenment.  First he tried the hard life, a life of prayer and absentance, then he tried the wealthy life, a life or riches and sensual pleasure.  But Siddharta did not find enlightenment, until he went down the path inbetween.  Radiohead head has tried popular rock, Radiohead has tried Experimental soundscapes, and now with Hail to the Thief they have combined elements from all thier deverse musical experiences, and compiled them into 14 beautiful songs.  <br />The album has a political tone to it, but its not about any one countries system, the songs focus on broad themes rather than actual issues.  Yes, some songs apply to america, but they apply just as much to other countries as well. <br />2+2=5 and Sit Down Stand Up are written from the standpoint of the mentality of leaders.  Claiming that the state of things is because we \\"Don't pay attention\\" and that we should follow them \\"into the jaws of hell\\".<br />I Will, is about a parent who is at their lowest but catchs sight of his baby child's eyes and rises up to see the beauty of the world and declare that \\"I won't let this happen to my children\\"  Rise up for the good of the children.<br />We Suck Young Blood is basically about how we prey off of each other and take advantage of unknowing and weary.<br />Myxomatosis is about a person who feels like a diseased rodent after trying to express his views to others<br />The tone is dark, and the lyrics are cryptic, which is nothing knew for a radiohead album.  <br />The two electronic tracks aren't quite as abstract as those on Kid A and Amnesiac.  The rest of the tracks focus around a mixture of piano and guitar.  Thoms vocals are beautiful, especially on 2+2=5, Sail to the Moon, and There there.  There were some less captivating moments on the album, specifically Go to sleep and scatterbrain.<br />Overall, its less abstract than their other recent albums, but is defintely a step forward, not backwards.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is the greatest Tool CD yet.  Aenima is awesome as well (I don't even know how many times I stayed up 'till 3:00 AM listening to it just spun out in my room), especially H., Jimmy and Third Eye, but it just doesn't match the vision of Lateralus.  I could be wrong but it seems to me that Tool is simmering down from the \\"pissed off at the world and lost\\" mentality to one that I would even call holistic.  But the genious is not lost in the positivity of this album.  This one, rather than sustaining that angry-desperate-yelling sound found in so many metal (or whatever genra you want to place Tool in, I personally don't think they fit anything out there) songs, goes utterly beyond.  It's like this group has been disillusioned (earliest works), become suspicious that there is more to life(Aenima), and finally enlightened (Lateralus).  This CD combines blunt and sometimes brutal truths (Grudge, Schism, Ticks and Leaches) with brilliant patience, peace, insight, and even wholehearted gratitude (Patient, Parabole, Lateralus).  <br />In the perfect world, no one would be allowed to die without experiencing this music.
B00009P1O0|4.0|Been listening to vinyl and tape versions of this one for many years now. I think I speak for most Neil fans when I say it's about time. Personal favorites include See The Sky About To Rain, On The Beach, Motion Pictures., and Ambulance Blues. The Bside is a much more mellow set of songs.   For those who are familiar, this is the third record of the mid 70's trilogy of albums he put out after the death of his bandmate Danny Whitten.  Starts with \\"Time Fades Away\\"  (another reissue), follows with the all time classic \\"Tonights the Night\\" and then finishes with \\"On the beach\\".  Sort of a Fall, Winter, Spring thing.  They were never released in the order they were recorded. Neil likes to sit on stuff for a while; which reminds me, where is that Archives collection Neil?

In a Sunburned Country is not his best, best book, but it's right up there.<BR>Bryson is in his favorite element when confronted with oddities of whatever area of the planet he's exploring. If there's one place on this planet that's filled with enough oddities to keep a curious man on the tips of his toes, it's Australia. The place abounds with critters that exist nowhere else on earth, including its people. As usual, for at least part of the way he is accompanied by a memorable companion, which gives him an opportunity to talk to his reading audience via dialogue with the guy sharing his motel room or sitting next to him in a car traveling thousands of miles through sere terrain.<BR>This is travel writing at its best, with a HUGE dose of humor.
B00005JM1F|3.0|Old School has its good points and its bad points. The movie is good, although they revealed way too much in the trailers. It is not nearly as funny as Road Trip or other college comedies. I was slightly annoyed at how they pumped this movie up so much, and it wasn't that funny. Anyways, the DVD is better. The &quot;UNRATED&quot; EDITION features nothing more than a few more women walking around topless and a scene that is rauchier. Nothing spectacular. The Extra features are good. The extended scenes are hilarious, and I wonder why the didn't put these in the movie...it would have made the movie funnier. Also, the blooper reel is very funny. There are a couple of standard 8 minute documentaries and the normal trailers and cast etc. Nothing spectacular. The menus get very repetitive and the music is VERY ANNOYING. IN conclusion, if you loved this movie, you'll love this dvd. If you thought the movie was okay...save your money.

B00000I8UF|5.0|This is some fine hard bop. The title track is legendary, but Blakey keeps everything hot. &quot;Moanin'&quot; is another fine Blue Note purchase, and while it can't quite equal the genius of Monk or Mingus or Miles, it can hold its own against any other jazz effort. A soulful, restless classic.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is one of the best albums by Tool. It has metal mixed with incredible lyrics that twist your thinking. At a first listen to the album you may find it complex and hard to understand but it soon grows on you. Of course if you don't like heavy metal don't by the album at all. You may also think that some of the songs do not fit with it but as I said before it grows on you. The tracks on the album range from heavy metal like \\"Hooker with a penis\\" to hard rock like \\"Stinkfist\\". There are also tracks with weird sounds in them...Die Eier Von Satan- a machine in the backround and a person talking in some langage, or (-) Ions- it sounds like a crash of an alien spacecraft with a very strange langage at one part of the track. I love Maynard's lyrics because they are different and not just the same \\"I love you why don't you love me\\" crap. There is also their artwork...wonderful and breathtaking. There is a picture of an alien with strange alien babies floating around the alien. There is also the Bill Hicks painting. Like many bands forget about their artwork Tool doesn't and makes it stand out along with their pounding drums that are not the same beats but complex tom and snare beats. One of the best things about Tool on all their albums is their music. I highly recomend this album for all people that like Tool's other albums...Opiate, Undertow, Salival, Lateralus, or like metal in the twisted form of Tool.

In this day and age, we are fortunate to be able to view such awesome footage of zeppelin concerts, spanning the early years to the end. people just have to keep in mind that this footage is 30 years old, so quality may not always be at its peak. Who cares its zeppelin!! you still get live versions of some of their best work. Earl's court was by far the best segment. the final verses in the dvd's book insert says it all &quot;this glimpse of the music and the performance of four musicians who transported their gift from a small basement room in chinatown, london, on to a wild rollercoaster ride through the clubs, festivals, and stadiums of the world of pop culture is quite remarkable. it is a stirring and dynamic insight into a unique entity.&quot;  zeppelin lives on...
B000092ZYX|1.0|Are we as stupid as they think we are? Can y'all hear the lyrics in that frumpy accent?<br />A pasty, emaciated, walleyed Euro warbles gibber-jabber to an imitation Massive Attack rhythm and you cows hail him a genius while he hails your president a thief. What am I missing? <br />What are you missing?<br />York should put to pasture alongside Pearl Jam, the Dixie Chicks, Hollywood, and France.<br />Shut up and sing.
B00005221L|4.0|Well here we are agian with arnie here to save a young woman from getting ripped to pieces from a deadly alien that looks uglier then monica lewisinsky. (That lady has problems)<BR>I liked it because of three things: One Arnie is in it, Two Apollo Creed is in it so that kicks your moms A...., and last but not least it is pretty cool.<BR>PARENTAL WARNING: THERE IS STRONG LANGUAGE AND SOME NASTY VIOLENCE<br />Colin Nickell
0783228317|1.0|This movie is so wierd, there isn't a story and if there is, it's really hard to find. All the people seem mad and the movie is boring because you do undersand what is happening because there's no logic. I bought this movie because I saw that Cameron Diaz was acting in it (I've got all her movies)but she appears during exactly 1.27 minutes!! I'd return it if it wouldn't be that 1.27 minutes of Cameron's appearance. It's such a shame that you don't see her more, it's a terrible loss! IF YOU DON'T COLLECT CAMERON DIAZ MOVIES, DON'T BUY THIS, IT'S A COMPLETE LOSS OF MONEY.
B00005JKZV|4.0|Alright I'll say it: THIS MOVIE ROCKS! I liked it because it was a great action move with all of the war scenes. BUT it had no like connection with the book but some of the main points. So Their isn't really anything else to say but that I recommend this to anyone who likes a good war movie.
B0000797IO|3.0|If youre looking for a friends kind of movie then dont get this one, rent Picture Perfect or just Friends. <BR>This is a movie that is all about the acting. I knew Jake could do it cause he played a similar character in Donnie Darko but i was not sure Jennifer could do it. But Jennifer surely prooved her worth and she got rid of the Rachel image right away. <BR>I belived the characters in the film and that matters a lot.<BR>This movie is wery tragic but still wery happy at times. The plot is good and the ending was surprising.
B00000J7L8|5.0|One of the more introspective and personal albums I've heard, The Hurting did very well for its remastering.  I listened to the original CD release recently then replaced it with this one, and it's a welcome change to hear a bit more life in this recording as well as some nuances completely lost on the original CD.  I did not notice a change in the speed, as someone else noted, but I have not done an A/B comparison.  The additional tracks are interesting and nice to have, but they don't add all that much to the original album.  &quot;The Way You Are&quot; is an oddity; it does not belong with this set except for its timeline (pre-&quot;Songs From the Big Chair&quot;).  Instead it's what happens when &quot;Tears for Fears&quot; tries to be &quot;WHAM!&quot;, which is a real break from the rest of the album's more early 80's synth/guitar pop sound.<br />But don't let that one track stop you from updating your current CD to this remastered edition if you are someone who finds this album important and meaningful.  This album will click with those who grew up in a world where love and acceptance either did not exist or were conditional at best and will be spending the rest of their lives looking for what they lost.  Musically and lyrically it is not heavy; it is surprisingly light and listenable despite the message underneath.
B00008LDPU|4.0|To my fellow basement dwellers, and Matrix plug-ins...<br />I strongly recommend ANIMATRIX -- some awesome shorts, with different, but sweet range of the new CG stuff/animation!   Must be some independent filmmakers drippin on acid directed these things.<br />It really ties a bunch on loose facts and actually make the Matrix plausible.  You know, the \\"ONE\\" concept, and the ZION (underground city undetected, yea).  OK here goes a short out-take to interest you.<br />Part I -- the the movie AI,  Man develops arificial intel and it starts to think.  All that Asic Asminov, stuff on artificial \\"feelings\\".  But now the oppression by man turns those basic machine feelings into \\"less pure thoughts\\" and war begins.<br />Part II --  Think T2 - Judgment Day -- in the war machines prove too much for humans.  So what do they do --> boom out come the nukes.  Only think is, who survives the nuclear winters easier...machines don't sweat the temp and the radiation, just the lack of solar energy.  Good war stuff.<br />Part III - think Core - well, kind of.  Now a small group of men's best and brightest left come up with the only plan they can think --- tunnel down at least 20,000 ft and build a shelter/bio- dome (soon to become Zion).  Detonate all that's left, let all the radiation in and smoke the machines.   Yea, it sucks, but we'll be wiped out anyway and let's go down swingin.<br />Part IV - nay,I'll leave the rest for you to see, but trust me, they're good.<br />((hell, I meant to get some bills paid, and all I've done is watch these things.))
B00003CXAT|5.0|To tell you the truth, if it weren't for a couple of elements, this movie wouldn't have been as popular as it became if it weren't for two things: forget Jeff Goldbrick, Or Sam Nelly, they were just there to give the voice of reason and the scientific background (respectfully). Okay, sure the CGI work was beautifully done, but they would have meant nothing without somebody to play against them. What really made the movie work were the young actress picked to play Lex (the beautiful Ariana Richards) and the music written By John Williams, which paced the ariel and dinosaur sequences nicely.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This CD is good.  Im not sure its better than the 71 live bbc cd they released a couple years back, but it has a few more tracks, and the sound quality is a little better, a little less bass heavy as well.  Page was ripping and Plant still had a great voice.  Only a year later at the NY Madison shows (Song Remains the Same material) Plant had lost the top end off his voice (thats why you dont hear Immigrant Song or the high parts of rock and roll etc...).  So this in my opinion is one of the last great zepplin tours.  From 73 on it seems the crew were pretty into drugs, bonham is fat, plant's voice is cracking all the time, page is sloppy.  Listen to the bootlegs and you'll see.  But this is a great show, as were almost all shows before and up to 72.  That dumb [*] who said Duran Duran was a better band and better musicians needs a beating.
B000002OOY|5.0|If someone ask's you why you think made John Williams so great. Ask them to hum out any piece of music from almost any movie... 90 chances out of 100, it will be from one of the following: Jaws, Superman, Star Wars, Indiana Jones or Jurassic Park or something derrived from or artistically similar to one of those themes. Even the Star Trek franchise couldn't have survived...or rather revived without John Williams. Okay, I know that John Williams didn't write a note of music for Trek...but think about it, the Motion Picture was supposed to be an answer to...Star Wars, and thusly the music was made to sound similar to the themes of Star Wars.<br />The music from Jurassic Park almost instantly became one of the most recognizable themes just over 10 years ago from this writing (June 9, 1993 marked the opening of the movie) and 10 years later, fans of the movie still thrill over watching the kids (Ariana Richards & Joseph Mazzello) get chased around the island in the visual medium, and my belief is that the movie wouldn't have been as good without two things: the beautifully played out looks of terror on Ariana's face and of course the background music to pace the entire things.
B00003BDXG|5.0|Sorry if you are swayed by the bad reviews, but this movie is a fine movie if you can look deeper into it and see the art for what it is.  Never have seen anything like it, never will. One of a kind, I am going to have it in my collection of great ones.<BR>Keep this movie away from the mentaly disturbed, and small children
B00008H2LB|3.0|I'll admit it. When Hybrid Theory came out, I got it, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was different at the time, and still remains a decent album. The problem is that Linkin Park knew this, and didn't really go anywhere else. This is really more of a Hybrid Theory Part 2 than a new album. The sound has changed very slightly, mostly just sounding more produced.<br />Not a very bad CD, in fact, it's a fun listen. Short, but fun. Nothing spectacular, nothing amazing, not even close to innovative or groundbreaking.<br />In short, while many people will enjoy this CD, it's not worth all the hype it got. With all the attention and tension leading up to it's release, you would think it would blow their previous efforts out of the water. Instead, they choose to do more of the same, and they will undoubtedly stagnate. If you want something truly groundbreaking, go listen to the Blood Brothers.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I do believe that a lot of Tatu's worldwide popularity has been achieved through the whole teen lesbian image. I suppose it's away to get teen boys interested. Well, I'm a teen and I'm a boy but I sure as hell didn't buy this for the image. The songs are actually pretty decent...mainly the first four tracks.<br />&quot;All the Things She Said&quot; was their American break-through. It's been one of the catchiest and most popular pop songs of the last year. It's impossible not to sing along to. &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; is the 2nd single and has generated some club play and light radio rotation thus far. It's a good song...great for dancing as is &quot;Show Me Love.&quot; &quot;30 Minutes&quot; is a haunting sort of ballad. I love the piano at the beginning. The other tracks are so-so but still worth a listen.<br />Now, I strongly doubt Tatu will have any longevity. In fact, I'll be surprised if they get through another album. However, as far as dance pop goes, this isn't all that bad. It's worth a listen.
0609610570|5.0|I found this book to be extremely useful. Larry Bossidy's view is that the main function of a CEO is to manage the nexus between strategy, operations, and people. He outlines practical techniques to do this that are simple to implement, and may seem obvious to some, but will result in measurable performance improvement in your business. Your staff will be happier with clear goals and Rewards linked to Performance, communication will improve, and things will get done.<br />Most companies I have seen, be they large or small, have a big gap between what the Board is trying to do strategically and what people actually do day to day. There are many examples of companies whose strategies sounded great but never really happened, resulting in catastrophic loss of value (eg the AOL Time Warner merger). This is the only management book out of hundreds I have read that tells you how to fill this gap, and make your business achieve its strategic goals.<br />Others here have mentioned Jim Collins. While Built To Last and Good to Great were interesting case studies of successful large companies, they gave me nothing that I could implement immediately in my business. Larry and Ram's book let me bring world class business practices into my small company, as soon as I had finished reading it.
B00005QDW5|3.0|I bought this CD as a sort of preview of Pink Floyd.  At first I found this collection to be a satisfying mix of tunes.  Then, I got a chance to hear part of the original DARK SIDE OF THE MOOON and THE WALL.  What a difference!  I found a beautifuly woven, intricate message that was composed of songs that were not only meant to be listened to as individuals but also flow into each other in a larger story.  <BR>This collection does include the best songs, but takes away some of their value due to the fact that they were taken out of context.  Pink Floyd set up many of their albums as complete works.  If any of these songs were taken out of order, they make much less sense.  I feel that the beautiful, intricate, and stunning musical message is nearly completely destroyed.  I recommend that first-time listeners dive in and go for THE WALL or DARK SIDE OF THE MOON instead of this.
B00004Z459|4.0|you guys that gave a one star to likin park heres my lil messesge to you get a job you bums.ok ok they may not be like the best metal band but give them some credit come on you losers. this time actully listens to them and you love it.why do you hate it man>?well this album is great and i have it hell yea man.
B00008DDJT|2.0|I hate to say it, but it was the flashy movie poster with tempting imagery of fire breath dragons demolishing London that drew me to this movie.  Unfortunately, the first few moments told me that I wasn't going to see what I expected.  In fact, the most you see of the dragons themselves are often shadows or brief glimpses.  When you do see them in full view, the special effects are quite good.  But I've seen much better.  The story had too many plot-holes.  The script was really lousy.  The actors did what good they could with what they had.  The best part was when they made fun of \\"Empire Strikes Back\\".  For a good dragon movie see... come to think of it, no good dragon movie comes to mind.
0316666343|2.0|I wish that I hadn't been taken in by the hype for this book as I think reading it was mostly a waste of time.  I was initially interested because I thought it would provide insight into the grieving process, but it really offers nothing new that previous Oprah-type books haven't already covered.  The best  work of fiction to deal with grief, in my opinion, is A. S. Byatt's  Still Life, the second work in her Francesca tetralogy.  There you see the blaming, the rage, the debilitating sorrow that are usually part of the process. This book 's problem is that the family at its core is too conventional  and uninteresting.<br />The book begins in a lurid fashion --but at least this section seems heartfelt and powerful.  The book  then descends into romantic mysticism and sentimentality, but unfortunately these qualities probably account for its popularity.  Instead of probing and exploring the reality of death, the book unconsciously  is a denial of it at the deepest level.  This is why it can't be taken seriously as literature. The book has a young-adult feel;  I'm  shocked that the author who has experienced a rape in which she almost died hasn't shown more maturity here.  She is obviously intelligent and talented, but I think real wisdom has eluded her as the sentiments expressed in the novel seem adolescent.<br />Why is it that the adult women characters in books of this type who are leading unfulfilled lives think that working in a place such as a winery is more fulfilling? Why would a woman abandon her other children at the time they need her the most? Why is there so little sense of the culture of the 70's in this novel?  Why are the characters so uninterested in anything but their domestic lives--no politics, no intellectual pursuits? Why are the characters so flat, so lacking in personality? Why are books of this type so popular?<br />There are many novels available that challenge one's preconceived notions and rise above the banal. I suggest Ian McEwan's  Atonement for a book that moves you and is intellectually stimulating.
0316666343|5.0|49 weeks on the LA Times best selling books for FICTION tells you that talented author, Alice Sebold has crafted a good story that stemmed from a horrendous murder of a 14 year old girl.<br />I'll cut to the chase on why this book is worth your time --  it tells seldom - told secrets about death, Heaven and souls that occupy our world.  Places like convalescent homes, hospitals, old theaters and old restaraunts feel so familiar and friendly to the living because our departed family members and good friends still hover over them...not all the time....but Sebold expands on the possibility of what the dearly departed do with all their spare time.  It's creativly written with kindness of heart and gentleness of the soul....and it encourages us all to believe in the goodness of angels near and far.<br />Sebold explains in a comforting way what Heaven will be like for us all on our fateful departure from Earth...<br />Heaven is unique to each individual - it is the stuff of our simplest dreams...and every Heaven is expandable and you make new friends....FAMILY however, is always family and there can never be additions to it unless it is created on Earth.<br />There is a lot of sadness surrounding young Susie Salmon's death --- but life goes on --- life goes on ---<br />and the dead never want us to be saddened by our loss of them.<br />I think this book could help those who've lost loved ones to violence....its a real winner.
B00008OWZC|5.0|IT IS LED ZEPPELIN AT IT'S FINEST. SOLID 3 CD SET AND GREAT CLASSIC ROCK AND ROLL! RECOMMEND HIGHLY.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This movie is great. I like this movie on the grounds that the new perspective of Cinderella minus the magical aspect is just great. It seems more realistic to me, regardless of the British accent that the artists may have while this film is set in France. Drew Barrymore is wonderful in her acting, and so does Anjelica Houston. They all get good lines, and the ending is truly funny. I've seen many stories of cinderella that has been written, including the mediocre and humorous work of Whitney Houston and Brandy (Eugh). This story is much more realistic/though erroneous of historical reference. It's a story you'll always fall in love with.
B000002JS6|5.0|I admit I'm a huge AC/DC fan, has all there cds, including the live one, but Brian Johnson really stands out the most in this one.  Unliike Fly On The Wall, or Blow Up Your Video his vocals, & lyrics stick out the most on this album.  For Those About To Rock was good but it doesn't define him like this album.  Don't let the 10 songs fool you it is a kick a$$ CD.  Songs like Let Me Put My Love Into You and Given the Dog A Bone takes a few listens to get use to but then after that you can listen to the whole album without stopping.  They are really good in concert even 20 years later.  The reissue is awesome as well but for some reason they don't have any at amazon...If this CD isn't in your collection , what have you been doing the last 20 years anyway?  And whoever gave this CD 1 star must be crazy or really high cuz I don't know how anybody can give it 1 star thats just crazy talk!  Just listen to the whole thing theres no need for skipping any tracks!
6300215512|5.0|Forget every movie you've ever seen. Forget who won the Best Picture Oscars. Forget the AFI lists of the &quot;best&quot; movies. Sunset Boulevard tops them all.<BR>What is the plot, you ask? It is a story of both sides off Hollywood. The realistic side is represented by Joe Gillis, a struggling screenwriter who is in debt to almost everyone (his landlord, the bank, etc.). To hide his car from repo men, he pulls into the garage of a house he thinks is deserted. He is spotted by the residents, a forgotten star named Norma Desmond and her butler, Max. Norma is angry at first when she learns he isn't the man who was supposed to deliver a coffin for her deceased pet chimpanzee, but when she learns he is a writer, hires him to edit her script (&quot;Salome&quot;). As soon as he accepts the offer, Joe begins sliding down a slippery slope: from writer to gigolo. When he finally realizes what he has become, he tries to leave, but Norma, unable to bear the thought that he doesn't love her, kills him.<BR>With the exception of a few other movies (i.e. &quot;Sadie Thompson,&quot; the best silent movie I've ever seen and also starring Gloria Swanson, and &quot;The Matrix,&quot; which has the most intriguing concept since &quot;Dark City&quot; and beautiful execution), it is the best film ever made.
B000002J09|5.0|First released in 1974 and almost 30 years later it still is a hit!  Although Stairway to Heaven is the most overrated song on this cd it certainly isn't the best song.  Black Dog, Rock N' Roll, &amp; When The Levee Breaks are one of the 3 best songs recorded in the past 30 years.  Going To California is also really good.  Although u may not be able to listen to every song on the cd, on the account of them being VERY long...but beware they are even longer live trust me..  I have a couple of there live cd's as well.  It is an enjoyable album to listen to and if your're a fan of LZ than this is a must have!
B00005QZWI|5.0|I have never seen this movie, but I got a taste of the music when the band I play in played a song titled &quot;Highlights from Lord Of the Rings-Fellowship of the Rings&quot;. My music score had titles of each segment of the song we played so naturally I went online to listen to the full songs. All of them are absolutely terrific! The segments we played were &quot;Many Meetings&quot;, &quot;The Great River&quot;, and &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot;. There were a few others we had played that weren't mentioned on the soundtrack list such as &quot;Gollum&quot; and &quot;Beginnings&quot;. Anyone who enjoys powerful music would enjoy listening to this music.
B000002JS8|5.0|This is without a doubt yet again another overrated AC/DC CD...Including Back In Black, and For Those About To Rock.  Although this CD kicks a$$ theres a few outstanding tracks such as, Shot Down In Flames, Girls Got Rythm, Highway To Hell & If You Want Blood (You've Got It!).  It's a great CD to crank up on your CD player or while your driving you car or while your relaxing by the pool.  Just buy the CD you won't be disappointed if you're an AC/DC fan, but if you are an AC/DC fan .... why don't u have it?
0140277447|1.0|This book exemplifies the adversity of racism and prejudice. Chang offers a story based on her own racism and hatred of a successful modern freedom loving country. This is evident, among many things, her apparent delibrate inaccurate accounts of esp. regarding japanese history. She paints the japanese \\"race\\" with a broad brush - as inheritely evil. This is simply absurd! I've reviewed \\"evidence\\" of this alledged incident from many sources, including this book, and the reviewer below does make some decent points.<BR>1. Standard issue for a jap soldier that served in China was a bolt action rifle/various sword types. This is compared to standard issue for a Jap soldier fighting Allied forces in the pacific - machine gun.<BR>2. Japan had only one division in Nanking. How do 5000 soldiers kill 300,000 women and kids within a few weeks by chopping their heads off? Can anyone really believe this?!<BR>3. It's documented by US historians that China fought a guerilla warfare. This means that alot of the soldiers didn't wear uniforms. This, in violation of international law. \\"civilians\\" killed were in fact, combatants. <BR>4. The population of Nanking was nowhere near 300,000. Probably closer to 100,000. <BR>5. More than 200 foreign journalists were in the area at the time. NOBODY reported any kind of atrocity during that time. Theres no way something this big can be hidden. This story only came out AFTER the war.... by the Chinese for propaganda purposes.<br />While it's true that Imperial Japan had no concept of treating military prisoners humanly, however, this book isn't about that.<BR>I'd agree with the reviewer below who said maybe 2000 or 3000 civilians were killed. This sort of collateral damage happens in any war. On the subject of racism and discrimination, keep in mind that the Chinese populations outnumber the Japanese by 1.2 BILLION. I simply don't see the glory of a people that outnumber another people by 1.2 BILLION, to bring back a \\"story\\" that came out AFTERWW2 by communist Chinese. How is a small minority supposed to defend itself if an enormous majority decides to attack them?? Sorry, this \\"story\\" doesnt fly...mao-ists with an agenda, plain and simple.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Sure its been 30 years since the original release of this CD.  Sure you already may own it.  Sure you may have listened to it over and over again.  But if your a Pink Floyd fan and don't have the reissue you don't know what your're missing.  The remaster of this CD sounds superb and is a must-have for any Pink Floyd fan.  Sure you may have heard the classics such as &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;On The Run&quot;, &amp;  &quot;The Great Gig In The Sky&quot; but why not give it another try?  There's nothing much different except for the fact that it comes in a different casing than your average jewel case.  The songs are digitally remastered x 10 it sounds great.  Trust me on this one....you won't be disappointed.
0440237688|4.0|This book was read in our English class, and I fully enjoyed it. Lois Lowry is an amazing author, and her story of The Giver, kept all our attention. The way she wrote of the future is unbelievable. Jonas' world was perfect until he became The Receiver. Then he learned of pain and war. Although many people are not sure what happened to Jonas at the end and have some \\"unanswered questions\\" I believe that Jonas and Gabriel died. When they are on the sled they talk about Elsewhere and they become warm and joyful.  This is a wondeful book, though, that EVERYONE should read.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is truely another amazing beautiful masterpiece by the chili peppers.  I bought Californication back in 99' when it was first released and I thought it was there best work since BSSM....I was wrong until this came out!  It has that Californication feel but some of it takes you back to the BSSM days like Throw Away Your Television, By The Way, Can't Stop, etc.  And song like Dosed, Zephyr Song, and This Is The Place take you back to the Californication days.  Now I must review each song one by one...<br />1)  By The Way - By the way it is a great opener nice lyrics vocals and bass lines .... way overplayed 10/10<br />2)  Universally Speaking - Kinda slow, mellow, you will start to like it the more you listen to it, nice guitar work 8/10<br />3)  This Is The Place - This was one of the songs that I liked the first time I listened to it great vocals and bass on this one 10/10<br />4)  Dosed - At first I thought this was another slow one but it actually picks up the pace during the song excellent guitar work at the end, bravo! Reminds me of Californication the song 10/10<br />5)  Don't Forget Me - Another good song, not good enough to be a single but still you shouldn't skip this one 8/10<br />6)  The Zephyr Song - Weird vocals, weird beginning, but all in all it is a good song, it can get boring after awhile, but good guitar/bass on this one 9/10<br />7)  Can't Stop - The third and maybe the last single on the CD, good drumming, bass, guitar, reminds takes you back to BSSM 10/10<br />8)  I Could Die For You - I didn't like this one at first but it sorta grew on me on 7/10<br />9)  Midnight - This is one of the non-listenable ones but it is still good enough for a chili peppers song 6/10<br />10)  Throw Away Your Television - Could've been a single but the message isn't radio-friendly.  Although it does remind me of the BSSM days...and cuz of that i'll give it a 9/10<br />11)  Cabron - I didn't like it at first it reminded me of mexican or jamacian music, but giveit a try...8/10<br />12)  Tear - Still worthy enough of a chili peppers song but it is worthy enough to skip 6/10<br />13)  On Mercury - An ok song, but worthy enough to skip 6/10<br />14)  Minor Thing - Also an ok song, but not listenable 6/10<br />15)  Warm Tape - I didn't like it at first but thats probably why they put it at the end 7/10<br />16)  Venice Queen - 15 & 16 are both good ways to end the cd to bad its already done 7/10<br />As you can see the 1-10 had all good ratings but the rest kinda went downhill this could be the next californication but I hope on there next cd they try and go back to there older roots instead of there recent stuff.  It's an enjoyable cd to listen to no swearing, great vocals, great bass, drums, guitar work etc...worth the money if your a new chili pepper fan but as for old ones this might not be your favorite of all time.
6304011431|5.0|An awesome and thought-provoking film.  I loved it, and came away wanting to be better than I am, and was reminded to be better to others.  I am drawn back to it over and over, and each time it touches my heart.  I am only sorry I missed it at the theater.  Take a break from the usual and treat yourself to a viewing of this movie.  As for the bad reviews---well, not all will be touched by it.  However, I think all will remember it.  See it.
0375703861|1.0|Yes, I understand that seems like a contradiction, but it was the exact feeling I had when reading this book.  Tehre were so many stories and subplots and new plots getting introduced near the completion of the book.  Suffice it to say I was greatly dissapointed with this read.<br />To give a summary, I am not even sure where to start. It actually did start out pretty strong.  With tales of an old friends and their distinctions, I thought it would at least be a well thought out book about friendship.  About a quarter of the way through, things take a turn for the worse and never really get back to the zealous and picturesque story telling that occured in the beginning. By time I was about 2/3 of the way away from completion, I couldn't wait to put it down.  Because I always finish books, I stuck it out, but believe me it was a chore.  There were a few moments of clarity where I thought things from the end would somehow tie into things for the beginning, but really that never happened.  I mean in the end we find the entire basis of the book, the only redeeming quality of life long friendship,  was a fallacy in the first place, and instead of expanding on this- even a little bit, the author just ends the book.  I mean really, what was the point?
B00005JM03|5.0|This is one cool movie! Everything about this movie is perfect! The action is hot! The cast us in top notch. And the score is so good. I loved this movie and I can't wait for the DVD! Defenitly see it its so much fun!
B00008PW3Q|3.0|This CD reminds me of Behind the Mask-- missing band members = uninspired music.  I think part of the chemistry that made so many of their true hits can only be found on the albums where all members are present.  If you're a hardcore fan, buy it... if you're looking for something like Rumors-- forget about it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead has got to be one of the greatest bands this generation has seen.  Very few bands are able to release the that Radiohead has been able to over the past decade; albums that are complete, they are albums, not just one single and a bunch of filler, but enough songs to warrant the purchase price.  When you pick one of their cd's up from the store, you don't feel ripped off because you are paying almost 20 bucks for one or two songs.<br />I believe that the best part about their songs is the lyrics; if you have not read them, you should, if for anything just to decipher what Thom Yorke is saying.  Once you are able to understand him, don't wonder what he is trying to say, try to find how the lyrics fit into your life, apply them to yourself.  Whether you are angry, sad, happy, whatever, you can find something in their catalog that will appeal to you, no matter what the intention of the band was.  This is so backwards from most of today's music; you can easily grasp what they are trying to say, and if it doesn't quite fit with your life, then oh well, look for something else to listen to.  Radiohead can be interpreted in about 1000 ways, everybody can listen and feel something different.  That is art, and this is a beautiful, lush album that I believe is the best major rock release since Tool's Lateralus two years ago, and I believe this tops that album.  Although not quite as good as OK Computer, it certainly doesn't fall too short.<BR>So go get it.  Now.  You must.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I can't describe it, what i feel, i guess almost like you guys. It doesn't matter if you saw Led Zepp sometime, THIS is a document you must to feel. The performances, photography, edition, and the sound are astonishing...this is the rock and roll document of the decade. you'll remember that.<br />and yes, there some interference in 5.1, and 2.0 dolby is fine. But later it may stabilized. There such a lot of rock power!
B00005YW4H|2.0|A couple of friends told me they thought I'd enjoy this album--maybe because I'm a big Madeleine Peyroux fan--but when I received it as a gift I found it dull. Monotonous. Soporific. Limp. Depressing.<br />Jones has a good voice, sure, but to my ear, she sings without feeling or nuance, like she's giving a recital at school. She sounds bored, and she certainly bored me.
B00006JKOM|4.0|Unusual Even for Tull - 4 Stars<br />While this album was supposedly a concept album, it takes a lot of effort to follow the story.  This album also departs from Tull's usual styling, which is an unusual comment given that I have emphasized in other reviews of Tull CDs that Tull has always followed their own musical path.<br />\\"Quizz Kid\\" starts out mellow and slow with strings and an easy electric guitar riff.  However, indicative of the punk age of the time, bass and electric guitar riffs push themselves to the front, and this song sounds like a punk-influenced hard rock song.  The lyrics are about going on a game show with the hopes of winning big.<br />\\"Crazed Institution\\" does not try to mislead you.  From the very beginning the beat of this song speaks rock.  By this song you are under the impression that Ian Anderson was striving for a harder edge on this album as compared to Tull's earlier folk-flavored offerings.  The lyrics in this song are about celebrity and fame and the insanity that such status causes a person's life.<br />\\"Salamander\\" provides the first real flavor of Jethro Tull as the group had been known up to this time.  Clever acoustic guitar picking takes you halfway through the piece until a heavily echoed Ian Anderson brings on the vocals.  The contrast between the acoustic and folk-flavored music and the echoed voice is interesting and makes me wish that Ian had explored this song in greater depth.<br />From a lyrical viewpoint, \\"Taxi Grab\\" is a relatively lightweight offering, and is not a fan favorite.  From a musical viewpoint, this song is a rocker, bass and harmonica driven, a blues-flavored hard rock song.  The music is pretty good, but the weak lyrics detract a bit.<br />\\"From a Dead Beat to an Old Greaser\\" begins in a traditional Tull style, dirge-like and acoustic.  The lyrics tell a story of someone sinking further and further into the depths, perhaps becoming the character of Aqualung.  The music remains acoustic until the end, keeping the dirge-like tune, though a saxophone-flavored bridge gives the song an interesting style.<br />\\"Bad-Eyed and Loveless\\" gives you the viewpoint of a woman as an old man thinks he would have seen her as a young man.  The instruments backing this song are minimal, principally an acoustic guitar.  This song continues the theme of someone who has degraded into the character of Aqualung; you have to wonder how much deeper into the depths this person can go.<br />\\"Big Dipper\\" shakes off the acoustics and allows the electric guitars to stretch their licks once more.  There are interesting percussion effects in this song as well as an instrument that I believe was a Vako Orchestron, a synthesizer.  The musical effects are unique.  The lyrics are all about fun and sex, the theme deceptively lightweight, hiding perhaps a sinister undertone.<br />I enjoy \\"Too Old to Rock `N' Roll:  Too Young to Die\\".  This song is bombastic, and perhaps the only song on this CD that shows much progressive rock influence.  The instruments are dramatic and strident, punctuating the notes in harmony rather than any extensive counterpoint.  Lyrically this song is about aging rockers when they get too old for the perceived style of rock that has historically emphasized youth, and of course they have many years left to live.  I wonder what Ian Anderson thinks of this song today.<br />\\"Pied Piper\\" has just a touch of folk-rock flavoring mixed into a rock beat.  The Vako Orchestron makes another easily discerned appearance, providing an unusual musical voice.  Because of the synthesizer sound, this song makes me think that perhaps Ian Anderson was influenced by Walter Carlos, who created \\"Switched-On Bach\\" and several other all synthesizer albums.  Lyrically, the character that sank to the depths of despair has been patched up and made anew, and now eyes young girls lasciviously.<br />The album finishes with \\"The Chequered Flag\\", a song that provides some soaring music and vocals, and yet is abitter-sweet ending.  The lyrics are about the incompletion of life.  The unfinished symphonies, the unread books, the tasks imagined and never satisfactorily accomplished.  The music is mellow, synthesizer and strings providing the core sound.<br />While Jethro Tull has historically combined folk and rock, this album is more a product of its time.  A synthesizer is clearly heard in several songs.  Several songs are clearly hard rock.  The Jethro Tull of \\"Thick as a Brick\\", \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Songs from the Wood\\" has temporarily taken on the mantle of contemporary rocker.  If Tull had not created the other albums for comparison, a listener might readily enjoy this one.  However, even Tull with their eclectic style moved too much to center for many fans, and perhaps lost a few fans as a result.  However, this album is, while not comparable to the best of Tull, a good 70s rock album.  While I am unable to provide a strong recommendation for this album, for Tull fans it is a must own.  For casual listeners, I recommend the previously mentioned albums, along with others that have a strong folk-rock and progressive influence.bitter-sweet ending.

B000002JAX|4.0|Unfortunately, I did it the other way around--heard her gorgeous, heartbreaking singing at a little Red Cross benefit in October 2001 and then picked up the record, which is beautiful but almost sterile by comparison. Hence the loss of a star.<br />I do listen to _Dreamland_ whenever MP hasn't done a local gig for a while, and it tides me over, but I try to go see her whenever I can (find gig listings at madeleinepeyroux.com). I took my parents to hear her, and my dad--a lifelong Billie Holiday fan--literally had tears rolling down his face, he was so happy. Every foot in the place was tapping. She is so much The Real Thing.<br />MP does keep saying that the new album's coming soon. I hope that it includes more of her own songs, as the ones I've heard are beautiful.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Kubrick's last film is a testament to the Kubrickesque moments that we have grown accustomed to over the years. Kubrick is a genius of the craft of film. Every film he has done is not alike. Kubrick is a maker of different genres. He creates and tantalizes audiences with film of each genre be it horror(The Shining), Sci-Fi(2001), Anti-War(Paths of Glory), black comedy(Dr. Strangeglove), period piece drama(Barry Lyndon), social commentary(Clockwork Orange), Vietnam(Full Metal Jacket), and the bible(Spartacus).<BR>     This is a masterpiece of cinematic craft. This is full of bravura imagery that is so definitive of Kubrick. He uses the reverse and forward dolly track shots and does not focus on characterization but instead on the issues so central in all of his films and that is the dehumanization of the characters. In this case the dehumanization is of the psychosexual that is inherent in all of us. He asks us the imposing question of can you retain some type of sanity in marriage and not deviate and plunge into the darker world of infedility and promiscious behaviour. How does one do that? Is it possible? There are the temptations that draw us into the world of ritualistic sexual behaviour. We tie ourselves down into the drudgery of the banality of the middle class American dream without even thinking about what we have enslaved ourselves into. Is there a way to breach the bonds of virtue and dwelve deeper into a world where there does exist a plain of sexual freedom?<BR>     Kubrick takes the issue of fidelity and liberation into the dreamscape panorama involving one man who dares to go on the journey. Does it involve one night of soliciting prostitution and strange, mystical ritual behaviour in a mansion on the outskirts of upper class New York or is this the hidden psycho-sexual yearnings that all feel and continually perpetuate throughout life? <BR>     Kubrick's last film has come full circle with regard to the hidden senses and underlying yearnings of all mankind in this master-crafted technincal masterpiece of cinema that is Eyes Wide Shut.
B000002LK1|5.0|This is the most I have ever played a CD. You will be able to listen to this CD back to front over and over and over... I would say this cd had to be worth hundreds of dollars to me... thanks DM
B00004U45G|5.0|When this album first came out, it had several strikes against it in my book: first, the album was comprised of classic tunes remade by someone else. Second, the album was comprised of classic tunes remade by one of their original creators long after the fact. Finally,it's a live album, and live albums rarely either provide good sound quality or recapture the excitement of a live show. And I'm a longtime fan of both Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes.<br />But I was very, very wrong.<br />First, the excitement and sound quality are definitely there. Kevin Shirley's production and mixing are top notch --- almost as if the man had master producer Jimmy Page looking over his shoulder the entire time. Second, the renditions of the old Zep tunes accomplish the near-impossible task of being both faithful to the original (Chris Robinson makes an eerily dead-on Robert Plant) and standing on the quality of their own musicianship. Finally, the partnership of Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes is brilliant. The chemistry is powerful, and the musicianship, both individually and collectively, is mindblowing.<br />My only regret is not having been in L.A. to catch the show!
0385504209|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I've read in a very long time and I am an avid reader.  I will have to say I picked it up and didn't literally put it down until the end. Where would you stop?  The author isn't against the Christain faith as some have written. I believe he actually confirms it.  Many scientists, artists and brilliant minds were ridiculed in their day and have been clearly accepted today.  Is it a book of controversy?  Absolutely.  Does it make you think, look and pick up copies of old masters to see what you've never seen before.  Definitely. Does it get people talking around the coffepot about a subject long forgotten?  You bet.  It is exhilirating. My favorite line  was about the greatest book ever written - &quot;you mean Harry Potter is about the Holy Grail?&quot; - &quot;I was speaking of the Bible.&quot;  I would love to meet this writer.  Kudos to you sir. And thanks from a female fan. May your tribe increase.
B00006690G|4.0|at first I thought this album was a little disapointing but after really listening to the lyrics and realizing his genius I gave the album the credit it deserves. cop this u should have it alreayd tho
B00008DDSC|5.0|Absolutely and utterly brilliant.  Period.
B0000508U6|5.0|First let me say I don't like to give a product five stars.  I try to reserve this honor for my favorite items.  That said let me say that this cd is definatly worthy of being in your collection.  The songs are very well written and I am difinately a fan of coldplays singing.  Although the guys sing higher than most guys can, their voices are never whiny and are easy to listen to and sing along with.  Among the highlights of this album (in my opinion) are Shiver, Spies, and Yellow.  Yellow is probably my favorite.  It has wonderful music and is easy to hum or sing. It's memorable.  Shiver is easy to relate to, even though I'm a girl so a lot of the songs on all guy band cd's aren't.  Spies shows coldplays &quot;story-telling&quot; skill in how the music and words change slightly to the end affecting the meaning.  But the songs aren't as overly deep as I make them sound.  They all have an excellent guitar background which works wonderfully with the singing.  You don't have to listen to the lyrics too carefully to enjoy the music.  Personally I often listen to this cd while I'm jogging or even at partys.  I highly recommend this cd regardless of your music genre interests.
0066214122|3.0|I have to admit, on the most basic level I really enjoyed Prey. The subject of nanotechnology is really interesting to me. Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age is a great peek into a semi-far future after nanotechnology has become common. Prey hooked me fairly quickly and I read it in less than a week. But as much as I like Michael Crichton's &quot;technology out of control&quot; books (Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, Prey, etc.), as I read Prey I couldn't shake this nagging feeling that I was reading the novelization of a movie. The way Crichton described some scenes seemed almost to be screenplay notes to an FX department, and I pictured in my head how a CGI team would implement them. I think Michael Crichton is a very good author, I'm just worried that he is starting to write books with the intention that they will be made into movies. And that is a formula for disaster.
B00008X5J3|5.0|I am very much a theater fan, and I thought this movie was a brilliant, gaudy, wonderful version of the musical Chicago.  I understand that the voices were not the most beautiful, but they were not supposed to be.  I thought the voices, faces, and acting abilities were perfectly matched to the characters.  I hated Moulin Rouge, could barely sit through it.  Chicago is a play that is based on the old vaudville routine, so no, there's not a plot.  It's not meant to be a story, and in fact this movie has nuch more of a plot than the play does.  I particularly adored Cell Block Tango, and thought it was a wonderful version.  I can't wait for it to come out on video, but I'll be sad not to see it on the big screen.  Truly an awesome movie!!
1400031354|3.0|My comments apply to all three of the authors books. You get no feeling of Botswana at all. People go to lunch at the Presidents Hotel, teenagers have &quot;attitude&quot;, homes have all the usual middle class western acouterments like tubs, sweaters of real wool are appreicated over &quot;polyester&quot;. These are all concerns and needs of a middle class English citizen where the author hails from and not that of a middle class Botswana citizen. This is not the Botswana I am seeing in the news nor does it feel real. Ok the book is fun to read to but by the second one you will be annoyed at its lack of authenticity and forced and phony simplicity.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Julie Taymor truly fascinates me. I was blown away by her knockout film debut Titus, and now she has created this excellent follow up, Frida. I loved Frida's artwork and was very excited to see this film, and was there in the theater opening weekend. I have to say I was not let down at all. Most of the audience enjoyed the movie too from what I overheard after the film ended. <br />I loved the lush colors, as many other reviews has stated. But, a lot of the color schemes were beautiful as well. For example, the scene where Frida is in Paris with the singing woman (which she spent the night with) was excellent. I loved the washed golden pallet used for that part. <br />Also, the bus collision toward the films opening was perfectly done. I loved all the little details such as the blue bird, oranges, and gold. The shot of Frida covered in blood as the goled dust covered her was truly haunting. Other things were nice as well like the New York collage, and the way Frida's paintings blended into her real life showed the emotional aspect from where the artwork came from. One part that is truly heartbreaking was the painting with her in the back brace, when the stone pillar that represented her spine crackles into many disjointed sections, and water wells up in the paintings eyes like tears. Artwork like that packs a powerful punch. <br />True, it may seem that the movie is more of a \\"highlights\\" or \\"greatest hits\\" of Frida's life rather then a textured novel. The movie dances from one event to the other. But, then again, it probably felt that way to Frida herself. <br />On another note, Salma Hayek was excellent in this role. I remember during Oscar season when everyone said she was the first one out of the race for Best Actress. After watching this again, I storngly disagree. You can honestly see Frida morph from a young wild girl, into the artist and woman, and finally into a angry cripple that still retained her humor. Hayek did this role justice. I shudder to think that Madonna and Jennifer Lopez wanted to play the famed painter in competing projects. <br />Finally to round out this review I would like to compliment this wonderful 2 Disc Dvd set. Julie Taymor has embraced the format to full extent with Titus, and now with Frida. Nothing but top quality from her. Bravo!
B000062XFG|3.0|I'm a big trekkie, but I'll have to say that this is probably one of the weaker seasons.  The short season had to do with the writer strike, which is fine.  But because of this by the end of the season it ended on a very weak episode which was mostly footage from past shows.  This is the one that most people complain about.  But I also couldn't quite see the point of The Royale.  I mean, it didn't didn't really give us a better understanding of the ship or the people, not exacly.  I've also heard about people not liking Dr. Pulaski.  That's too bad.  Diana Muldaur actually does a good job, but I guess she just never really meshed too well with the crew.  She reminds me of the crusty Bones though, whom I liked very much.  (Just wish she wouldn't have picked on Data just because he's an android.  Maybe that's why people didn't like her.  I mean, Data is quite the popular android, no?)    I've bought all the boxed sets because, well, I'm a trekkie, and I wanted a complete collection, but I'd have been much happier if Paramount had not charged so much for this season at least, especially since it has less content.  OK, I'd have been happier if they charged less for all the sets in general :-) , but in particular this one.  Heck, if Stargate SG 1 is only half the price.....  Ya know what I mean?  I think it was just following the trend set by X-Files or something.  Sigh.<BR>But at least by the second season everyone is more established, so things have settled down a bit.  Q is always good.
038572179X|5.0|A warm summer day in 1935: thirteen-year old Briony Tallis has written her first play in honour of her brother Leon returning home, but her niece and nephews are not up to performing it. While she is sulking in her room, she sees her sister Cecilia strip of her clothes and jump into a fountain in front of the cleaning lady's son Robbie. Her ample imagination turns this scene into something it is absolutely not and when at night something awful happens she interprets it completely wrong, an interpretation that will change the lifes of herself, Cecilia and Robbie.<BR> <br />The second and third parts of the book are situated at the beginning of the war: the horrors of the evacuation of the British army at Dunkirk and the life at a London hospital. Finally in the fourth part, set in 1999, it becomes clear that this book is indeed one big atonement.<BR> <br />This is an incredibly rich book and very smoothly written. It begged me to continue reading, even though the setting of the first part (a rich English family in the thirties) is not particularly interesting to me. The second and third parts very vividly describe the horrors of war and the fourth part glues the whole book together and on the other hand also provides an unexpected twist that puts part of the story in a whole new perspective. An absolute must-read.
078062582X|1.0|I can't believe this was 'based' on a book. In reading other reviews, they say it dosen't really follow the book though.<br />So maybe it's alright?<br />Because, this movie was absolute CRAP!
B000021XR5|5.0|To start off I have to say this is a great album.  I think it's one of Stp's best if not the best.  When I first heard the cd I didn't know what to think and I thought there were alot of filler songs that really didn't matter.  But this is a cd that grows on you and you have to give it a chance otherwise it won't grow on you and you'll feel like you wasted your money.  Songs that do grip you are ones like Sour girl and Down but after a little listening you will find that all the songs are good in different ways.  I will say the way the cd is set up is kind of strange.  Let me explain, There are times you go from a soft melodic song to a hard rock song.  Like I got you and MC5.  Other then that little weirdness this cd is classic.  The more you listen to it the more you will realise it is one of the best Stone Temple Pilots albums ever.
B00005JKN9|2.0|I've been a great fan of Scorsese's films, and I appreciate how deep he go into his films to portray a certain story in the past. However, \\"Gangs of New York\\" is not about NYC's past, or history, is about a family feud between two misfits who fight for the same reasons that every current war derives, including Mr. Bush's. Well, I think for this period of time is a political correct movie, but for someone who gave us \\"Taxi Driver\\", \\"Mean Streets\\", \\"Last Temptation of Christ\\", \\"Goodfellas\\", \\"The end of Innocence\\", among others, is definitly a step back, just like or current world.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Before you even get to the musical brilliance contained within, you're struck by the packaging: beautiful photography, cleanly typeset, elegantly opening to the information you want and the discs inside. Then you realize, than unlike \\"How the West Was Won,\\" (genius) this DVD contains not one or two concerts but a Zeppelin fan's dream collection of live sets and promo clips. The biggest Zep fan in the world couldn't have done better, nor asked for more. I would have paid three times as much for this embarrassment of riches. I would have paid three times as much for mono bootlegs of this stuff-- and it's in DTS!!!!!! It's shocking that in this day and age, Atlantic cared enough to give this mammoth band such royal treatment. This DVD leaves the comprehensive Queen and Bowie DVD collections in the dust, it's really that good. To all the artists and record companies and DVD manufacturers out there: Don't release another music DVD until you study Led Zeppelin DVD CAREFULLY and commit to reaching this standard. It really is special.
0312265859|4.0|8th in the series. Trenton, New Jersey's Stephanie Plum, bond enforcement officer, a.k.a. bounty hunter, has her hands full with a charity case. Evelyn Soder and her daughter Annie are on the run. Her ex-husband is threatening to collect on a child custody bond that will force repossession on Evelyn's grandmother's house. As always, nobody's telling the whole truth. There's always more to Stephanie's cases than meets the eye. Eddie Abruzzi, Evelyn's landlord, has threatened Stephanie to stay away from Evelyn and her house. What's it to him?<br />On the side, Stephanie's also looking to bring in Laura Minello-auto theft, and Andy Bender-domestic violence. As always, Lula, ex-lady-of-the-evening, rides shotgun with Steph, along with Albert Kloughn, Evelyn's divorce lawyer. Kloughn is like a pain-in-the-butt little sibling, always latching onto you. But he may have the hots for Steph's sister.<br />Trenton cop, Joe Morelli, is still trying to decide if he wants to continue as Stephanie's love-interest. While he's deciding, he's always there for her, to help out or just grin. And then there's Ranger, the best bounty hunter ever. Ranger's the Wizard \\"because he's magic. He mysteriously passes through locked doors. He seems to read minds. He's able to refuse dessert. And he can give me a hot flash with the touch of a fingertip.\\"<br />A new character is also introduced. Jeanne Ellen Burrows, the female equivalent of Ranger, sporting a black, leather Donna Karan catwoman outfit. I'd like to see her again in future books. What else? Snakes, tarantulas and a 6-foot killer bunny. Yes. A 6-foot killer bunny.<br />Like other reviewers, I agree that Hard Eight was a bit more light-hearted than the first seven books, but only through the first two-thirds. I couldn't put it down for the last 100 or so pages, constantly laughing out loud and dropping my lower jaw. There's much more emotion and reflection on Stephanie's part. The reader really gets into her head with sympathy and understanding. Don't misunderstand. It's funny. I was also shocked by so many actions by so many characters, like Steph's Mom, her sister Valerie, Ranger and Grandma Mazur, as always. Steph's Dad gave us a few sentences longer than 2 words. Shocking. Bring on number 9!
B000096I9G|5.0|Fantastic picture shot on HD video.  Great sound with Dobly 5.1 or 2-channel 48 kHz PCM.  Three great albums.  The Cure have never sounded (or looked) better.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I bought this CD not expecting what I was going to get. But after listening to it, my ears liked what they heard! Christina has a very powerful voice and she really puts herself in the song. My favorite songs were Fighter and Beautiful. Even though she runs around in basically nothing and has how many body piercings, her CD still kicks butt!
B000089CJI|5.0|though ive yet to purchase the cd (hard to find in my area) ive heard most all the songs and know alot about the band... i just wanted to note that Jimmy and Ben arent the only members of the postal service-- Jenny Lewis, front girl for Rilo Kiley, was invited to be a member when they needed a angelic female voice.  i abosolutly love postal service and i VERY highly reccomend Rilo Kiley to all. thanku the end.
B00005LLK8|5.0|A young lad decides he likes ballet better than boxing. This does not sit well with his father, a very macho man who works in the mines. And what we have is-- in the best sense of the word-- an extremely &quot;sweet&quot; movie. On the eve of Father's Day, this is a great movie to celebrate fathers for Billy's father grows and changes and come to appreciate his son's great talent. Anyone who has known the pangs associated with being different and not fitting in can relate to this fine movie.<br />I have seen this movie again and again. The poignant ending still makes my eyes water.<br />What makes this movie even more meaningful is that it is based on a real little boy's experience. Additionally, I read recently that for the first time ever the Royal Ballet has more young men enrolled than young girls and all because of this great little movie.<br />If you haven't seen this gem, go rent it today. Or better still, purchase it. You'll want to see it again and again.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is an amazing album.  To the reviewer who thought it sounded like a couple of kids banging pots and pans, it might a little, but they'd have to be pretty damn talented kids.  Songs like Girl You Have No Faith in Medicine and Hypnotize are great for riding in your car with the volume jacked up.  Until i met up with the White Stripes my favorite rock band was Blink 182.  Thank you Jack and Meg for making such kickass music.
B00005ATQC|4.0|I have seen this movie three times and am happy to say it has grown on me. I'm still not sure I understand the movie but perhaps I'm not supposed to. There are unanswered questions when the movie ends, at least for me. It's certainly about the subconscious, sexual fantasy, dreams, reality, etc. I'm not sure Kidman and Cruise, though both beautiful and easy on the eyes, were the best choice for the lead actors. They appear to be playing themselves. I notice that a lot of people thought there was too much nudity. There's plenty of that, at least female. My biggest complaint is that parts of the movie are tedious and dull;(the movie is too long) I'm thinking in particular of the scene where Kidman and Cruise get stoned. High people are dull; these two are no exception.<br />The movie, however, is beautifully filmed. The scenery is lush and rich in detail, particularly the interior shots. There is great suspense here. The section of the movie at the masked \\"orgy\\" is brilliant and the best part of the movie. Parts of this movie will haunt you long after you see it.<br />This is not Kubrick's best movie; but even when he's not at his best, he's better than most other directors.
B00008H2LB|1.0|How can people listen to this godawful crap?  I thought rap metal was finally dead then these bastards show up and begin selling millions of albums to folks with more money than brains.  If you want to listen to some white guy rapping buy an Eminem record.  At least he's got some talent.  If you'd like to hear kickass rock buy the album White Bood Cells or Elephant by the White Stripes.  Or buy any rock album, chances are it will be better than this Lincoln Logs record.  Or Linkin Park.  Whatever the hell they're called.  This band is the toilet of rock.  Please don't buy their music.
0425129616|4.0|Agatha Christie's first Hercule Poirot mystery is the ever-delightful The Mysterious Affair at Styles.  All of her trademarks are right here from the beginning in the character of Poirot and his brilliant gray matter and the delightful Hastings (before he become completely stuffy, as in the later books).  There are red herrings aplenty and everyone seems to be up to something suspicious, much like one would want from an English country house.  I have taken a summer vow to re-read all of the Poirot books that I read over the past four decades but this time to read them in the order they were written.  The sole advantage of memory loss may be the ability to read these books again without a clue as to who did it.  Maybe growing older will not be so bad.  This book makes a perfect start to the series and to my summer.  A bon-bon of Belgian chocolate.
B00006LSM3|5.0|This album was definately George's best. It is so unfortunate that this was his last because despite hearing this one, his future work could have just as good, if not better. George was obviously surrounded by experts who helped him make such a terrific album (guitar and production by his son, Dhanni and Jeff Lynne. Not to mention the wonderfully distinct drumming by Jim Keltner.) Throughout this album, George sings about his life and his security with his religion, giving an optomistic view about his inevitable death. I can conclude by saying that this is easily George's best work in years and when you listen to it, you will definately think the same.
B00005B36H|5.0|It's the only album from Tool that lives up to my expectations- my expectations which are set in the clouds they are so high.  This ia a by-product of the hyperbole the fans spew about this band.  This album is the only one that could be labeled as &quot;one of the best albums ever, period.&quot;  You know, that cocky tool fan tone.  Yes, this album is that.  I enjoy playing it on guitar, singing it, and trembling in fear from the last track, WHICH by the way has provoked tears to flow out of my eyes several times for reasons unknown.  Get it.  Get the album, I'm amazed and you will be too.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This will be kept simple:<BR>  Have you forgoten what rock sounds like?  How about: what's cool, what rocks, what brings it, what rock stars look like, how bands should play and simply what kicks a#s!<br />  Well, Zeppelin and this video is what you need...What a band!  I bought a $$$ surround sound system just to support this DVD set. My wife and 8 year son love it!<br />Scott
B000002LEE|5.0|how do you describe the best studio cd from the best art-metal band ever???... what words would do it justice???... hmmm... if you've never jumped out of an airplane or surfed a 15 foot wave - it's ok... just listen to this cd loud, b/c it will have the same effect - pure adrenaline.  you will feel like you just got shot out of a cannon..., and you will truly start to believe you can fly...  it's sick...  <br />just be careful, b/c you need to know 2 things before listening to this:  1. it will take you about 5-10 full listens at high volume to \\"get it\\"... and 2. once you do, be careful... b/c you will start to sweat, shake, slobber, etc. when listening - i'm really not kidding - and old people will hate your guts for listening to this irreverant art, b/c it scares the hell out of them... <br />i love music, and i appreciate all kinds of music, from mellow to hard... and this cd is probably my FAVORITE cd of ALL TIME... the reason being is, it does not sound \\"dated\\" even to this day... as a matter of fact - i really don't know of anything more current in this genre that could even hold a candle to this masterpiece.(Nirvana, Tool, Korn, Deftones, Rage, RHCP, Pumpkins, Pixies - I love em' all, and they are all great in their own way, but to me - they don't compare to Jane's)  buy it - you will start to worship at the altar of Jane's.... these guys truly are way ahead of their time - it really will change your life.  EPIC cd...
B00005JKPF|5.0|When I was a teenager I would sometimes close my eyes and try to imagine what would a movie about the X-Men would look like. I would try to picture how the characters would look, the costumes, and the different situations I would put my favorite Marvel Mutants in ( being mind numbingly bored by the New Haven, CT public schools, I naturally had alot of time to think about such flights of fancy). Now after seeing X2: X-Men United, I'm starting to think that director Bryan Singer must have been a mind reader. This movie is EXACTLY how I envisioned the X-Men on the big screen.<br />X2: X-Men united picks up the story shortly after the conclusion of 2000's X-Men film. Magneto has been defeated and is now imprisoned. Wolverine is in search of his past in Canada. And all is seemingly quiet at the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters in Salem Center, NY. But things are about to take a sinester turn. A rogue goverment element led by a William Stryker, is plotting the destruction of all mutant kind. He has more personal reasons for wanting to destroy mutants it seems, and also a personal score to settle with Charles Xavier. The story is based on the 1983 Marvel X-Men graphic novel called \\"God Loves, Man Kills\\". Director Bryan Singer has gone out of his way to deliver a spectacular film presentation of the story. A few changes here and there are noticable, but on the whole they work in the context of the story and are forgivable. What the story does so well ( and what I felt that the X-Men have always done) is illustrate that the battle lines, in the war of Humans vs. Mutants, are not always clearly defined. The \\"bad guys\\" aren't intrinsically evil. And some of the \\"good guys\\" don't always do the right thing. Where a character like Superman is strictly \\"hero\\", the X-Men are the definition of \\"Anti-Heros\\". They don't want to save the world, they have to because no one else can. And no X-Man more clearly fits that description than Wolverine. The majority of the film is spent on Wolverine delving into his past. He's trying to figure out exactly who he is and where he comes from. Along the way he's aided by his fellow X-Men, and even by Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants. <br />The special effects are extremely well integrated into the action. At no time does X-Men descend into a \\"special effects\\" film. The main thrust is always the story. The pacing of the story is also very even. Starting slowly then building ultimately to a crescendo. The story does have a feeling finality to it but it leaves the door wide open for a sequal. Some may not understand what exactly happens at the end of the film. All you need to know the BEST is yet to come.<br />This is probably one of the best two disc DVD sets to be released this year. Crips audio, great transfer, nicely laid out menus and a ton of extras make this a must buy. There is also a directors commentary by director Bryan Singer that gives you alot of insight into the making of the film. This is truley a fitting DVD release for this film.<br />I can't say enough good things about this movie. If you haven't seen it, then get yourself to a movie theater right now and do so. If you have seen it, see it again! At a time when the comic book movie has gone from a \\"genre\\" film to a big budget Hollywood epic, X2 will set a standard that comic book movies will have to live up to for a very long time to come.
B00008OWZC|2.0|This concert was recorded way way back in 1972 and sure sounds like it. This is the flatest sounding CD I've ever heard. No bass, no high end, and little seperation! I was hoping that the digital processing could have put some of the magic back in the music but I guess the Jimmy Page the producer was aiming for something else.<br />My Klipsch THX speakers are just sitting there limp waiting for the music to come though but there just isn't anything there. <br />This is a slice of history and all the classic 'Zepp songs are here just not with the punch that I remember them having so long ago.
0345440900|5.0|This is just simply a wonderful, wonderful book.  With a ton of parenting books out there, it's so comforting to know there is one that presents totally unbiased views and leads you to make your own decisions and conclusions.  I feel so much more prepared than I did going into my first child being born (this is my second) having read this book because I know that with the help outlined here, I can finally KNOW a way to listen to my baby and communicate with him!<br />In response to the reviewer who ranted about the information being useless, I completely and fervently disagree.  The author never once touts one method over another and presents all sides equally, which to me discounts what the reviewer stated.  <br />Obviously, if you have hard and fast ideas about how parenting \\"should be\\", this book is probably not for you.  However, if you want to educate yourself by exploring all avenues and make up your own mind instead of being rolled over by a lot of the \\"you should do this or you're no good\\" attitude that a lot of books an so-called experts emit, then this book is perfect for you.  Parenting is different for everyone, and this book explains that and helps you make the most of what type of parent you want to be.  IT'S ALL YOU NEED!!!!
B00008DDXL|5.0|This movie was great. The actors were great. Everything was so realistic. It was like you were standing right there in the middle of everything. Dobby looked so real. This movie is filled with adventure and action. People of all ages will love it, I'm telling you. There's not one boring part in it. Once one exciting thing is over, another exciting adventure begins. If you want a movie with numerous adventures in it, realistic creatures, magic, suspense, wonder, and action in it, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the movie to get.
0393057658|3.0|This book has a lot of funny moments, and makes some interesting points, but it is just an extended article that doesn't prove a point, and seems to be more about the author exploiting baseball fans ...than giving them something memorable.  <br />We learn about Billy Beane's mania and that OBP is important to scoring runs, and signing guys that walk a lot is cheaper than signing 5 tool players with good jawlines.  So what?<br />The A's win a lot of games because they have 3 great, not good, starters.  This could not be disproven by any of Bill James' suckup labrats.  How is winning 100 games during the regular season not to Hudson, Zito, and Mulder's credit, but losing to the Twins is Hudson's fault?  The A's are like the Braves from the previous decade.  Like the Braves, the A's don't hit that well.  Unlike the Braves, they probably won't keep the 3 star pitchers around, and guys like Scott Hatteberg can not walk their way to championships while giving up 8 runs a game.<br />Theories are great, but who has more World Series rings, Sparky Anderson and Joe Morgan put together, or Bill James and Billy Beane put together?<br />Just as Billy Beane uses a relief pitcher's hot streak to temporarily inflate his value, Lewis has used the A's 2-year hot streak to inflate the value of his ideas and to sell books.  Not that it's a bad book, it just isn't convincing.
0385504209|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read!  It was a first<br />Dan Brown for me and certainly won't be my last.  After reading it, I immediately ordered a copy to be shipped to two of my out of town friends, insisting they read it. This book is so entertaining and so thought provoking. I found every word to be SO interesting and could not put it down. The story was fast paced and exciting, but I especially loved all of the factual stuff in it.  I was online immediately, excitedly looking up the works of art, math facts and the religious societies the book discusses. I haven't been so excited about recommending a book in a long time.  This is a great book, no matter what your reading taste is.  Truly a book for everyone.  Thank you Dan Brown.
B00008WG3U|1.0|As a fan of punk I was sad and just disturbed to here this album.  I mean this album spits in the face of all the bands who have tried to make a diffrence.  This album severely underminds the attempts of Good Riddance and Anti Flag, bans who truly believe what they write, and live it.  All the NOFX did was read some Noam Chomsky and decided to jump on the bandwaggon.  The sophmoric lyrics were very entertaining with all there other albums.  The punk-ska-pop mixture worked real well in all the other albums.  I just feel that when music is used to try to make a statement you have to be more serious with it.  This album is too popy to have any effect on anyone who listens to it.  This kind of punk just holds back all the attempts of other bands to point out the faults of what is going on in America.  Franco-un-American is a poor attempt to try to point out the faults of America.  For one Michael Moore is and idiot, the other Noam Chomsky is just overused in all aspects, and are they donating half of the profits from their album to a good source, no.  If you want to get some punk that actually makes a diffrence you need to start with Good Riddance \\"Songs For the Modern Rebellion\\" or Anti-Flag \\"Underground Network.\\"  This is a terrible album.  The two previous mentioned donate like a dollar from their album sales to food not bombs.  Dont buy this, for two reasons.  One it sucks, and two it underminds bands who really try to make a diffrence.
1582432678|5.0|Maybe the term &quot;great American novel&quot; is too shopworn and  turgid to describe Lionel Shriver's &quot;We Need to Talk About Kevin.&quot; Yet by any contemporary standard, Shriver's novel is both great and profoundly American; i.e., it has important and true things to say about the way Americans lead their lives, pursue their careers, struggle with their marriages and, above all, raise their children.<br />Shriver's theme, as other reviews make clear, is the high school massacre of the Pearl-Paducah-Columbine variety. Michael Moore tried to plumb the subject in &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;: the result was a tendentious, thoroughly manipulative documentary aimed against the usual suspects. <br />Shriver's book, too, easily could have descended into polemic or cliche. Instead, Shriver chooses the teenage murderer's mother Eva as her narrator, and Eva isn't about to scapegoat anyone except possibly herself to account for her son Kevin killing nine of his classmates. How did it happen? How did this child, raised in upper class comfort with doting and educated parents, turn out as he did? Is it Eva's fault? Is it the fault of &quot;society&quot;? Or was Kevin just born bad?<br />Shriver asks the right questions, thinks them through the right way, plots her story smartly, and puts it all together in compulsively readable prose. It's a novel that should be at the top of any intelligent person's summer reading list.
B00008LDPU|2.0|further proof that at the heart of the Matrix is... little more than that revealed in the first film. The sequel and this animation shift emphasis from the notion that &quot;reality is a dream&quot; and emphasizes a by-now hackneyed &quot;man versus machine&quot; formula.  Is this the world of the Matrix, or a preview of Terminator 3? The background &quot;Second Renaissance&quot; is third-tier Asimov at best, and Last Flight of the Osiris is not more successful at accomplishing anything than Final Fantasy. As for the others -- come on... Are a series of &quot;Tone Poems&quot; already the only things they could cobble together with such a rich concept?<br />All in all, I suspect the Animatrix is the shape of things to come for the Matrix... but fortunately, we'll only have to go back there one more time...
B00000K0EA|2.0|After resurrecting the Bond franchise singlehandedly with a bang in 1995's Goldeneye, Brosnan hits the big screen for his sophomore outing as the larger-than-life superspy James Bond 007 in 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies.  Despite the hype of commercial endorsements and Teri Hatcher's highly anticipated appearance as a Bond girl, Tomorrow Never Dies was a rather surprising setback to the Bond series.<br />In this eighteenth Bond flick, Bond is off to investigate an incident off the South China Sea, where a British ship appeared to have crossed Chinese waters, eliciting a warning from the Chinese military, which amounted to retaliation on both sides.  Deducing that one of the media sources, the Carver Media Group had released the news of the incident in question suspiciously earlier, Bond deduces that Eliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), the media magnate and owner of the Carver Media Group, had something to do with this international incident.  It turns out that Carver is manipulating the news, in some way, shape or form to start a World War III for astronomical worldwide television ratings.  Bond must stop further escalation of war by thwarting Carver's plans.  <br />Tomorrow Never Dies is not exactly up to par with the Bond movies of the past, as a rather incompetent cast, an extremely over-the-top storyline, and a horrifically dull screenplay drag what could have been a solid Bond film into a forgetful disaster.  Brosnan is probably the only saving grace of the film, as he turned in a decent Bond outing, although his performance in Goldeneye was far more superb.  The blame does not lie squarely on Brosnan's shoulders as his supporting cast was a big letdown.  Michelle Yeoh of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fame is a solid martial artist, but rather static in personality, making her lines corny in the process.  Teri Hatcher portrays the forlorn, tragic Paris, Eliot Carver's husband and Bond's old flame and it is quite disappointing that she is not only not the leading lady,but that she will go down as an uneventful Bond girl, since she does not get a whole lot of screen time in this film.  As for Eliot Carver himself, he is the most disappointing character of the film as he is quite undeveloped and he winds up being a wimpy, whiny control freak megalomaniac.  His henchmen aren't that much better either.  Carver's main henchman, Stamper (Gotz Otto) relies too much on his machismo, hence more unimaginative and plastic in his dialogue and portrayal.  The short-lived Dr. Kauffman comes across as a formidable henchman, but becomes nothing but comic relief villiany fodder.<br />As for the story itself, it is rather complex, in the sense that it alienates the viewer into ever being involved in the film's purpose.  The screenplay and dialogue are surprisingly poor and they drag on.  However, Tomorrow Never Dies scores points for ingenious gadgets, in particular the trackpad-controlled, voice-activated BMW 540i and Carver's boat drill.  The action sequences are solid, with the pre-title sequence and the motorcycle chase standing out as highlights.  In summing Tomorrow Never Dies up, it is not a bad film to watch and relax to on a Saturday night, but there are even better Bond flicks to not only sit back and enjoy, but to get you involved in the film.
0783222955|5.0|I've watched this film 2 to 3 times a year since 1962 and never get sick of it.  Peck's Atticus Finch is without a doubt the greatest hero of all time.  The multiple plots from Boo Radley to Tom Robinson to Truman &quot;Dill&quot; Capote keep your attention from beginning to end. Harper Lee wrote a masterpiece, and, even though some characters such as Aunt Alexandria and Mrs. DuBose were minimized in the film, it too was a masterpiece.
B00005JLXC|2.0|I just want to roll my eyes, sorry comic fans but this is completely disturbing. I've included some spoilers. <br />Its a complete failure in my opinion. Yes the movie is dark, it has the feel of those \\"Batman\\" movies, but I was completely disgusted at the fact that this movie promotes vengeance rather than justice. <br />When Matt can't win cases in the courtroom, he decides to go out and teach them a lesson. That's not justice, that's vengeance. In one scene he finds the man and puts him on the subway tracks to die. Its quite interesting 'cause in the end of the movie, he decides to show mercy to Kingpin. He should have shown mercy much sooner in the movie. <br />If your analyzing the movie, I guess it means that his character grown from the person that he used to be early in the movie. Whatever, I liked \\"Spider-Man\\" much better, at least \\"Spider-Man\\" learned faster. <br />This movie is also more graphic with its violence and I was disgusted at some of the stuff that I saw. Like the fact that Bullseye kills people with pencils, chokes a lady with a peanut, and other disgusting things just because Bullseye doesn't like them. He gets a thrill out of killing people. <br />At one point a weapon goes through Elektra's hand and through Bullseye's hands too. <br />Honestly, the Green Goblin from the movie \\"Spider-Man\\" seems to be a boyscout compared to Bullseye. There's not that much special effects here and I was disappointed at one time when Matt decides to have sex with Elektra even when he hears a call for help.<br />That is just completely disgusting! Go, help them first and then do whatever you want!! This movie is dark on so many levels. I was disgusted and disappointed. I like action movies and their a whole lot of fun but when the characters are more noble like \\"Spider-Man.\\"<br />I think this movie was trying to emulate \\"Spider-Man,\\" however it just fails miserably and I was disappointed. Don't make the mistake of renting it.
B000008LOV|3.0|The Traveling Wilburys (Vol. 1) sounds like a terrific concept: five accomplished musicians from various musical genres (and generations) uniting to form a short-lived band. Although the band sounds unified, they manage to fail quite often in the \\"excitement\\" category.<br />Producer Jeff Lynne gives the album an overall lavish treatment. This orchestra and guitar combination works well when fronted by the aching and melodramatic voice of Roy Orbison. The \\"only the lonely\\" legend adds a heartbreaking touch to the tender \\"Handle Me With Care.\\" Again, on the cha-cha \\"Not Alone Anymore,\\" his performance is classic Orbison. The song includes some sterling (if uncredited) lead guitar work. Both \\"Heading For The Light\\" and \\"End Of The Line\\" shimmer with vitality.<br />On the other hand, \\"Dirty World\\" and \\"Rattled\\" are dull shuffles (is there such a thing as an exciting shuffle?). The reggae-like \\"Last Night\\" and dreary \\"Congratulations\\" plod along.<br />Perhaps I would have been satisfied with a Roy Orbison album produced by Jeff Lynne.
B00005JLEU|5.0|First i must say.. Mayazaki ROCKS!!  He is that good.. i loved this movie, yes a little scary for my brothers at some parts (except they are really babyish) so dont' hesitate on buying it because of that.  it teaches good morals, and they did an awesome job on the dubbing (except personally i like it in japanese and subtitled) but thats just me.  I dont' want to get into the story and spoil it for you, but this is definitally an awesome movie!!!!!<br />p.s. Don't forget to see princess monoke, castle in the sky (which I loved) and kiki's delivery service.

0385504209|4.0|I thought this was a good book.  Of course most of the book will turn most conservative people way off, but it was fun to hear some thoughts on the other side of things, some of the items talked about could very of well happened.  Look for yourself at the &quot;Last Supper&quot;, I was surprised I didn't catch one of the things before.  Overall a good chase mystery novel.<br />The author is not &quot;pushing&quot; any particular views on you, it is just a novel afterall.
0316666343|1.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" belongs in a teenage babysitter series. It pulls its punches from the beginning and asks its readers to suspend both belief and intellect. I understand the romantic appeal to the gushy-gushy set, but unless you loved the movie \\"Beaches,\\" stay away.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Another excellent album. So glad I bought it. Thoroughly enjoy listening to it play after play. But I think the second half tracks are easier to listen to then the first half?? My favorite tracks are A Wolf at the Door (which I am singing along too like crazy) and A Punchup at a Wedding. The lyric book is so amazing to read. The special limited ed. poster is a real bonus too. Other tracks i have to mention are The Gloaming and There There. Brilliant music. By the way if nobody has mentioned it yet - Warning this cd is copy controlled.
0790743507|5.0|Singin' in the Rain (1952)   103 minutes<br />Studio: Warner Studios      Director: Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen<br />Debbie  Reynold - Donald O'Connor - Gene  Kelly - Millard  Mithchell - Joan  Hagan - Cyd  Charisse<br />    The  setting  is  1927  in  Hollywood.  The  story  is  about  a  man  trying to  keep  his  movies  going  without  any  sound.  Don  Lockwood  is  the  movie  star  that  acts  with  a  leading  lady  of  Hollywood  and  they  have  to  become  what  the  people  want,  so  they  act  as  a  couple.  The  problem  is  that  he  can't  stand  her.  He  finds  a  woman  in  the  movie  that  he  is  smitten  by.  Her  name  is  Cathy,  and  she  is  a  show  girl.  <BR>     <BR>     I  loved  this  movie.  It  have  more  talent  in  this  one  movie  than  all  of  the  movies  I  have  seen  in  my  time.  To  bad  I  am  to  young  to  really  appreciate  the  times  that  it  came  from.<br />     The  movie  was  in  color  and  to  bad  they  changed  it  because  it  would  have  been  good  in  black  and  white  also.  <br />     Don  falls  in  love  with  Cathy  and  Lina  is  upset  that  it  is  not  her  that  he  has  fell.  When  they  make  their  first  movie  with  sound  it  is  a  flop,  so  they  decide  to  remake  parts  of  the  movie  to  make  sure  they keep  their  audience.  They  decide  to  make  it  a  musical  and  to  have  Cathy  be  the  voice  over  for  Lina.  Lina  has  an  awful  high  pitched  voice.  Lina  at  the  showing  of  the  movie  shows  her  true  colors  and  blows  her  own  cover  about  her  voice.  The  movie  was  The  Dancing  Cavalier.  In  the  end  everyone  is  happy  and  the  talkies  took  over  the  business  of  Hollywood. <br />     A  great  musical  for  the  whole  family.  I  am  giving  many   stars,  because  so  many  movies  don't  have  the  talent  they  used  to  have  to  bring  people  in  to  watch  the  best.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Ever since Kid A I've approached each new Radiohead release with some kind of scientific skepticism. Something in me just doesn't believe that they can keep putting out such quality work.<br />And there's also that part of me that, while absolutely adoring the beautiful calmness of Kid A and the fluid weirdness of Amnesiac, has been totally craving a return to the intense energy of OK Computer.<br />Well... here it is, and here it ain't. Hail to the Thief combines the electronica elements of Kid A and Amnesiac with the guitar-driven frenzy of OK Computer, and mixes in a whole new dimension of lyrical/vocal and synthesized exploration. <br />Things I love about this album: the blending of real drums with techno beats; the more intimate sound of the vocals; the more liberal use of vocal harmonies; and the superb energy in the more  aggressive songs - \\"Myxomatosis\\" is probably their most rocking song since \\"Paranoid Android.\\" <br />But, the flip side is that for every aggressive song, there are two \\"soft-n-slow\\" ones - and of late these are veering away from the strong ballads Radiohead used to write, and going more in the direction of \\"Thom Yorke whines with guitar or keyboard accompaniment.\\" There are exceptions, but most of the slower songs get pretty annoying pretty fast. This CD could easily have been pared down to 8 or 9 tracks without losing anything.<br />So... it makes me a little sad, because this album seems to cement the direction Radiohead started taking with \\"Amnesiac\\" as their new sound. But the more energy-laden songs are still fresh and exciting to me, so who knows? Maybe there is still hope after all.
038572179X|2.0|Not on my best-seller list!<br />I really had to trudge through the first 50-80 pages to gain a sense of direction.  Too much time and attention was devoted to unncessary scenery and minutiae at the characters' expense.  Only from the book jacket did I get a real grasp of the time frame for the story.  Was the over-wrought description of the vase really necessary?  Did it lend anything to the story?  I just didn't find the characters well-developed -- given the lack of dialogue and interaction.   <br />Part II felt very much like a reincarnation of &quot;Birdsong&quot; by Sebastian Faulks.  <br />The book's only saving grace was the juxtaposition of the final section, and the questions left to ponder.  Hardly enough, in my humble estimation, to warrant the first 150 pages.
B000002I7H|5.0|Unbelievable! This album is awesome. If you like the electric blues guitar, Albert King is your man and this album is his best. Excellent guitar solos accompaniad by great deep vocals. Only one song i don't love. An attempt at a slow song, &quot;I almost lost my mind&quot;. It is Albert King tryin to be what he is not. The rest of this album is the best collection of blues i have ever heard. Three words.....BUY THIS ALBUM!!
0553573403|5.0|Now, I've read a lot of Sci Fi/ Fantacy. When reading a genre such as this, there are two different categories: the good, and the bad. There is no maybe here. With the Game of Thrones, Martin has outdone himself. One thing I loved was that, you could never tell what would happen next. There were times when I wanted to put it down, just because I couldn't stand what was happening to the characters, but, Martin has a way of wrapping it all up, though not entirely prettily, even though so much \\"bad\\" has happened. I am amazed by the book. If possible, I would give it as many stars as are in the sky. A book well written, Martin. A job well done.
B000005J08|5.0|The work of John Zorn spans a seemingly infinite array of genres and runs the gamut from complete crap to complete genius. For someone interested in buying their first Zorn recording, simply going to the record store and grabbing a random CD out of the bin would be tantamount to putting a hand in the shark tank hoping to catch a salmon. <br />Luckily, there's an answer for you: the debut Naked City album.<br />It would be difficult to rave about this incredible CD enough. It is mind blowing in every way. And unlike many other Zorn offerings, it is fun and accessible, provided you can get past Zorn's saxophone shrieks. And I'll sympathize with you if you can't, because they can get irritating; but if you can't get past them, then you might as well throw in the towel now, because few Zorn recordings come without them.<br />In my opinion, the musicians in Naked City are absolutely the best Zorn has worked with in any of his projects. Bill Frisell's guitar playing screams with rage and whimpers with beauty; Fred Frith's elegant and fluid bass playing is unmatched in the world of genre-jumbling bands, as is the insane drumming of Joey Baron; and Wayne Horvitz glides masterfully between styles on his multitudes of keyboards like a juggler tossing executioner axes on a unicycle. Boredoms vocalist Yamatsuka Eye also appears on a few tracks here, and like the shrieking saxophone, he takes some getting used to; but the comedic and dramatic elements he brings to the table are vast and powerful.<br />Lots of other reviews have talked about specific tracks, so I won't rehash them here other than to add that my favorites are the bizarre pairing of Ornette Coleman's \\"Lonely Woman\\" to the bass line from Roy Orbison's \\"Pretty Woman,\\" and the assorted short hardcore tracks in the middle, which really kick.<br />If you do get this album and like it, you should proceed in short order to Torture Garden (or better yet, the Black Box set, which includes Leng T'Che) and Radio. Avoid Absinthe and Heretic, which boast less of the craziness that make Zorn's music wonderful, and more of the avant-garde pretentiousness that make it annoying.
B00008NRI9|1.0|Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are nice to look at, as are many of the supporting cast.  Some beautiful&sexy outfits, too.  Looking at their pictures in a magazine would be a better use of time. <BR>Thin plot;  unbelievable behaviors for supposedly  professional<BR>lawyers and wealthy businessmen.  I guess the stars' names helped pay for the cost of making this film.  In a nutshell:  <BR>Thoroughly beyond belief, and  rarely/lamely funny.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I read about how it takes a few listen to's to get into it but I got into it as soon as i popped the cd into my stereo.I just bought the new cd &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; and it does take me a while to get into it and my girlfriend hates it.I told her to not focus on Thom's voice just listen how it goes with the music.Oh well...........bottom line is this cd goes up there with the greatest of all time!Period!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This is truly an awesome work of art..It is amazing to me that Fleetwood Mac is still making relevant music after all this time.  And yes, Christine is missed, but the magic between Stevie and Lindsey on this album more than makes up for it.  Stand out tracks include the haunting 'Illume', 'Thrown Down', 'Silver Girl', 'Goodbye Baby', and 'Come'...Lindsey really lets go on 'Come', amazng guitar playing, he is so underrated. And yeah,there are couple of songs that border on metal, but Lindsey makes it sound great! So what if it doesn't fit the mold, thats what I've always liked about FM, always different. 'Whats the World Coming To' and 'Miranda' are classic Mac - couldv'e easily been on Tusk. About the album being too long, there are a couple of tracks that shouldv'e been left off like 'Bleed To Love Her', we heard this song on The Dance and the studio version wasn't exactly compelling, but overall, I think its a great package that blends the solo sounds of Lindsey and Stevie backed up by the awesome ryhthm section of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. I saw them live a couple weeks ago over in Jersey and they just rocked! best concert in years..my 15 year old brother who loves Linkin Park and Tool even likes this album...a must have for any FM fan new or old
B00006AVRK|5.0|The only annoying thing about these DVD's is the fact that several key characters are portrayed by different actors in subsequent seasons.  Fortunately, Jeeves and wooster remain constant, and they of course are the selling point.  You just have to get used to the aunts, cousins and wacky friends changing actors and it is manageable once you get used to the idea and roll with it.  Every episode is hilarious and the setting and ambiance are fantastic.  I like the music too.  You will definitely get your moneys worth, even if you are new to Jeeves and Wooster.  The P.G Wodehouse books about the same pair are fantastic and should be read to more fully enjoy the shows.  If you are into Brit comedy &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; with John Cleese is great too.  But I digress.  This DVD set is great, with no useless and annoying frills, just a heaping helping of hilarity.
B0000039LE|5.0|I LOVE Halloween! The plot is fantastic, and I really like all of the characters, and felt sorry for them when some of them died. I enjoyed Jamie's character, Laurie Strode, because I too am a babysitter and can relate to how she feels about certain things.<br />None of the other Halloween films have, in my opinion, been nearly as good as this one, which uses suspense and scare instead of blood and gore. I encourage everyone to watch Halloween .. it's my all-time favorite, and I hope it will be yours as well!
B00005JM1F|5.0|I absolutley love this movie. I saw it the night it came out and laughed my bum off all through the movie. It has some very funny scenes and Will Ferrel adds his charisma wonderfully in Old School. I recommend this not because it was a great movie but its funny every single time you see it, and to me thats worth buying the DVD.
0385504209|5.0|Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down! It was captivating. I can't wait to read another of Dan Brown's books.
B00005OAIE|5.0|So I checked out John Mayer because I dug the chick in the wonderland video...the song grew on me...bought the cd and haven't taken it out of the cd player. Have purchased his first cd &quot;Inside Wants Out&quot; and newest material &quot;Any Given Thursday&quot; on CD and DVD, the guy rocks! I'm sure if you sit and listen to each of his songs you'll end up finding some correlation with an event in your life and it amplifies each track. This CD keeps me in a good mood at all times and you must purchase it!
B00005LC6Z|3.0|I loved the first movie because it was all suspense and scare with no blood or special effects, but the second one was basically just gory .. i didn't get scared at all! Also, in the first movie, we all liked and understood all the characters, making it much more powerful when they died. The second Halloween made no effort whatsoever to make us like and empathize with the characters, making us care very little whether they live or die. The second movie, however, is pivotal to the series, considering the fact that we learn of Micheal's and Laurie's relationship. And, I don't think that Jimmy and Laurie got enough time together in Halloween II .. it would have been nice to have a little romance between them .. I hope that this review was helpful to you!
B000006CCG|5.0|There have been a lot of albums I've loved throughout my life, but few are those that last as time goes by. Usually I will listen to them for a few months, then shelf it and maybe listen to it again a few months later, eventually as the years go by I listen to it again and wonder what I thought was so great about it in the first place. Fewer are those that I still like after years. And rarest of all are those that I still love as much now as back then. WASP - WASP is one of those albums.<br />Although not every song on this album blows me away, those ones that are merely good are outweighed by the truely great songs.<br />The album starts out with one of the greatest WASP songs ever, and one that defined their drive for decades to come. I wanna be somebody is the kind of song you can just sing along to as loud as you can. Sure, it's a bit cheesy, but let yourself get into the energy of the music and it's just plain fun.<br />There are tons of great songs here; LOVE Machine, Hellion, Sleeping in the Fire and School Daze.<br />On your Knees and The Torture Never Stops are my personal favorites. They still rank up with the best songs of all time.<br />The two added songs are great as well. I'm still getting used to there being two songs after the album I am so familiar with ends but I'm glad I bought this version (even though I had the original one already), it was well worth it.
B000003489|5.0|Coltrane's work on this album is still impressive even after forty years since its release. The title track still sends shudders down the backs of the most experienced in the jazz realm. After absorbing the entire album, you will have a better understanding of how jazz is a personal, expressive artform that has no boundaries. I recommend this album to anyone who wants to explore the many possibilites that Jazz offers to the musician and listener alike.
B00008LDPU|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this DVD after suffering through the horrible &quot;Director's Cut&quot;-style editing of &quot;Matrix: Reloaded&quot; (despite the Wachowsky brothers' enthusiasm for Japanese anime, they have not caught on to the philosophy of minimalism).  However, I feel that they have redeemed themselves with this creative effort through their favorite medium - anime.<br />What is so brilliant about this collection?  It would help to remember all the movie-based cartoons that were aired on TV.  The animators were restricted to plots that were solely made to market the franchise (do you remember any Star Wars based cartoon that left any impresson on you?).  The results were invariably a derivative of the live-action original.  Instead, the brothers respectfully allowed each producers to interpret their world in the producer's own style.  The result is simply amazing - the collection's central theme is a framework rather than restriction, and the creativity and the skills of these animators really shine through.<br />The collection is good for the most part.  There are some weak points:  Matriculated relied too much on visual elements that were better told in spoken words (besides, robots do understand words and reason, don't they?  And so does the audience).  Detective Story was stylish but got choppy and was hastily ended at the scene on the train.  The Program was the most disappointing, with many repeating visual elements that points to lack of effort, and the quality falls far short of the producer's earlier work, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;.  The rest is okay.<br />The most outstanding work is &quot;The Second Renaissance I &amp; II&quot;.  It deals with the one of the main theme of the Matrix series - the fraility of human kind.  The compressed imagery has the pace of an Osamu-styled (a la &quot;The Phoenix&quot;) manga - many of the scenes are taken from our recent history but re-styled for cohesive storytelling.  This will explain why many youngviewers will not understand the message that is conveyed by the choice of imagery.  <br />Also, the origins of the idea of interdependence of man and machine (also presented in Matrix2) is presented as the rational extension that follows the miseries brought on by both sides - an idea that confused many revieweres here.  <br />As far as violent nature of the imageries goes - since many images are re-take of the actual events in human history (just replace humans with robots), it is far from gratuitous and it is meant to get your hands dirty.  I would understand that children and the undereducated will have a hard time understanding this.  That said, just take it easy and enjoy the ride, this is simply an entertainment!
B000092ZYX|5.0|first off, i think that this is the logical sequel to OK Computer. It could fit in between that and Kid A. Which makes it nothing short of brilliant. i have to describe this song by song:<br />1. 2+2=5- This song is a great opener, you hear the guitars kick in with some really paranoid and angry sounding lyrics. Definitely a short but passionate adrenaline rush.<br />2. Sit Down Stand Up- this song will hypnotize you with luscious Kid A-esque soundscapes and Ok Computer type melody. There are also some electronic blips and effects.<br />3. Sail To The Moon- has one of the most haunting piano lines theyve ever done, with the guitar blending over it. Really cool and soothing.<br />4. Backdrifts- its electronic swooshing will remind you of Like Spinning Plates most likely. probably the trippiest song on the album. very melodic though nonetheless.<br />5. Go To Sleep- this will be their 2nd single, and i know it will be huge. its a catchy acoustic number that will surely get stuck in your head and will remind you of \\"the Bends\\".<br />6. Where I End and You Begin- reminiscent of 60's progressive rock, itll take a couple of listens to get into, very good.<br />7. We Suck Young Blood- twisted lyrics sung over a strange yet cool piano line. the climax of this song is really exciting and great.<br />8. The Gloaming- This will most likely remind you of \\"Amnesiac\\" or \\"kid A\\", its almost entirely electronic with some synth soundscapes in the background but its still incredibly melodic and a great listen.<br />9. There There- the first single, very guitar rock oriented. unlike most of their other guitar ballads because it also possesses an ambient quality.<br />10. I Will- i think this song was too short but its still a good song. Nice little guitar ballad.<br />11. A Punchup At A Wedding- an awesome song that is centered around a funky bass line. its lyrics are very angry and frustrated and thom sings them with with that passion. I found my head bobbing along to it.<br />12. Mxymatosis- This song doesnt even sound like radiohead to me. it has a heavily distorted bass riff that sounds like it could've come out of an electronica rock hybrid band or something. i love the song and its lyrics, i think its a great step in the right direction for radiohead.<br />13. Scatterbrain- softer ballad that calms the album down a bit. not the best here, but very good.<br />14. A Wolf At The Door- this song is really creepy, it has alot of lyrics in it and it has a rap like flow to it. i love it and i think its a great album closer.<br />im not sure if i should rank this with radiohead's other albums yet but i do know that it is superb in its own right and a worthy purchase. itll take a couple listens to absorb it completely.nt even sound like radiohead to me. it has a heavily distorted bass riff that sounds like it could've come out of an electronica rock hybrid band or something. i love the song and its lyrics, i think its a great step in the right direction for radiohead.<BR>13.

B00004RFFL|3.0|As others have already skewered this movie on their petards pretty thoroughly I just wanted to make a few comments.<br /><br />This film is sort of like a weird combination of The Right Stuff and Rosemary's Baby. In another review I once said The English Patient was sort of like a combination of the Elephant Man and Lawrence of Arabia, except that movie actually worked, but this one really doesn't, although I did appreciate the stylish cinematography--I'll give them credit for that.<br /><br />I didn't think the acting was as bad as some of the other reviewers here thought, but the premise is pretty silly--aliens erasing a couple of astronaut's brains with a powerful radio signal and then taking over their minds themselves--and even getting their wives pregnant with supposedly alien babies. Why all of this is so sinister is never really revealed, since most of the time the Johnny Depp character is helping his new employer design a new plane. And the babies are expected to be pilots some day. So what? This is supposed to be some sort of evil alien invasion or plot? Snore. Call me when the sky starts falling down.<br /><br />Still, the overall ambience was adequately creepy almost from the start to the end, and the special effects with the Depp/alien creature at the end getting fried were pretty cool--with some effects reminiscent of the Ark of the Convenant scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark. I give it 3 stars for the nice cinematography and overall weirdness factor. Otherwise it might only be a 2. I say wait for this one on HBO and don't Bogart the popcorn.
6304508611|1.0|The first Stephen King book I read was Carrie..then being the movie freak that I am, I saw the movie right afterwards..THE MOVIE [wasn't good]!!  The novel is worth a 2-3 hour movie..not a 90 min teen horror flick that had 10 minutes of useless nudity at the begining..and then because there wasn't much time left, the ending was changed TOTALLY!!  The book was perfect but the movie was REALLY bad..for a more accurate movie, watch the NBC TV remake of the movie..it's not accurate either (being in the 1990s/2000s and all) but it's closer than the original movie..In other words: READ THE BOOK!!
B00009APK1|5.0|Im a really big fan of the lord of the rings and even though the whole book could not be put into the films i am still apeased by the film's quality.  I have one thing to say about this Dvd... just rent it and wait for the special ed which will have a ton more goodies in it as well as the hour + of deleted scenes
0385504209|5.0|This novel is a amsterful work that combines a realistic story of fiction with an amazing buffet of facts. I love books that take common knowledge and show how it could be/in fact is otherwise. This book fits that description in every chapter within. I hope to read his other works as soon as possible.
B00006BTCA|5.0|What sets this album apart is the band's incredible knack for creating tension and resolution (ok, their hooks are great too).  These guys build, peak and resolve like no one else.  The arrangements are impeccable.  If someone doesn't like this album it's because they didn't give it a chance (4 or 5 listens).  Every song is a gift (including The Specialist, which is a must add-on).
B000002MX7|4.0|Should have more Rufus tunes on it to be a real best of collection.  Still, Chaka has had her share of great songs.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This could possibly be the toughest item I've ever tried to review.  Why?  Because words alone could not describe the magic that blossomed from this quartet from Liverpool.  One needs to take this set of discs, sit down for 10 hours and watch the series in its entirety.  That is the only true way to appreciate the Beatles' story, life and music.<br /><br />That said, there is plenty here to satisfy even the most dedicated fans.  You will see concerts and interviews, home movies and newsreels, and the beauty of it is, you will not find this stuff anywhere else (except bootlegs, of course).<br /><br />There are many exciting moments found in this set.  Here are some of my personal favorite moments:<br /><br />*1962 - \\"Some Other Guy\\" from the Cavern Club<br />*1964 - \\"She Loves You\\" from Washington DC<br />*1964 - \\"All My Loving\\" from the Hollywood Bowl<br />*1965 - \\"I'm Down\\" from Shea Stadium<br />*1966 - \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" from Japan<br />*1968 - \\"Revolution\\" from the Smothers Brothers Show<br />*1969 - \\"Get Back\\" from the Apple Rooftop<br /><br />Another aspect of the Beatles Anthology is that, sprinked throughout the series, you will find musicians other than the Beatles singing either Beatles songs, or songs that influenced the Beatles.  For example, the Rolling Stones singing \\"I Wanna Be Your Man,\\" Bob Dylan singing \\"The Times They Are A-Changing,\\" or Jimi Hendrix singing \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\"  These are very interesting.<br /><br />One more thing that absolutely thrills me is that during two moments in the series (Washington DC and Japan), fan-shot footage is substituted for the footage that everybody knows.  You will not find that ANYWHERE else.  It is moments  like these that put me in Heaven every time I watch them.<br /><br />I could rave forever about the Beatles Anthology.  But now I think it's your turn to enjoy it.
B00005JM1F|4.0|For all of you reading thinking &quot;how in the world is this getting a 5star from some and 1star from others?!?!?&quot;  Have no fear, THIS IS A FUNNY MOVIE.  I love Animal House, this is not animal house, but this FUNNY.  I was rolling on the ground while watching it.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Say what you want but take Mr. Potato head and remove some of his parts...the nose, the eyes, that freaky Cliff Claven mustache, and he looks downright...well freaky.  So that is the question with Fleetwood Mac, remove one of their parts and what do you have?  Remove Christie McVie and will the music hold?  Or are you left with a freaky eye-less potato head begging to stare at you from a gothic canvas of blank brown.<br />Where Lindsey Buckingham leads, Fleetwood Mac here still shines.  However, as much as I hate to say it, where Stevie Nicks takes over without the balance of McVie, \\"Say You Will,\\" says it falters.  Nick's songs sound like a post-apocalypse solo effort.  She has had one too many cigarettes...one too many fatties.  Her voice shows.  What was once an endearing enchanting falsetto becomes a worn-out chain-smoking relic of self-absorbed conversation.  On \\"Say You Will,\\" it is no longer endearing, it's Mr. Potato Head without a nose.<br />Nick's isn't all bad, but the songs she sings could easily be on yet another solo album.  \\"Say You Will,\\" is too long and suffers from it.  \\"What's the World Coming To,\\" is every bit of pop brilliance that \\"Hold Me,\\" was from \\"Mirage.\\"  \\"Murrow Turning Over in His Grave,\\" has a \\"Tusk,\\" feel to it. In fact throughout where Fleetwood Mac performs as a group and Buckinham's songwriting and guitar-work leads the way, Fleetwood Mac is still vital, still vibrant.  Strip away Nick's fare and cut a solo and then you'll have a emergence with \\"Say You Will.\\"
B000002JSP|2.0|After ten years of ruling the roost, the mighty Zeppelin finally crashed and burned in '79. John Paul Jones (the quiet one) dominates this record with a phalanx of ill-advised synthesizers and sappy piano work. Bonzo sounds good, but even the Mighty Bonham couldn't save the execrable synth-prog of &quot;Carouselambra&quot;. The opening drone of &quot;In the Evening&quot; is reminiscent of &quot;In the Light&quot; and seems to indicate that the holding-pattern of &quot;Presence&quot; was just a fluke. Nope. Instead of Zep's tried-and-true, Wagnerian riff-rock Valhallah, we get ... synth rock?! Huh? Page's tremelo-warped riff is nice, but the corny synths dominate and ultimately detract from what could have been Zeppelin's last great rocker. The &quot;dreamy&quot; bridge was a great idea, but the slick production and artless, el cheapo synths ruin the magic. Unfortunately, &quot;In the Evening&quot; is the best thing on this flaccid album. &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; smells like a dry-run for Plant's turgid solo career. Disappointing to say the least.
B00005NWRS|4.0|The obvious hit here is track 2, &quot;Firecracker,&quot; with it's country come rock swagger, but is it enough to carry the work up to the level that the name of Ryan Adams has generated to the throne of alt-country.  Almost, but not quite.  There is elements of the Eagles here, elements of Paul Westerberg and the Ghost of the Replacements, Van Morrison...all good company to be in.  But Ryan Adams has yet to find his voice, which may be a good thing.<br />He is brilliant in places but not super stellar overdrive brilliant.  Give him time folks, after breaking through in Whiskeytown as the Nirvana of Alt-country Adams is due some respect.  Adams is a songcrafter at heart, but needs some seasoning and boundaries to reach greatness.<br />What do boundaries have to do with musical greatness you may ask, but I offer as exhibit A, Prince Roger Nelson as an example of songwriting excess.  So it is with Ryan Adam, on &quot;Gold&quot; he has a lot of ideas, now he just needs focus to obtain brilliance...oh yeah and leave the overblown dramatics of track 16 &quot;Goodnight Hollywood Boulevard,&quot; behind...far behind.

B00006J3WH|5.0|To discover that one man wrote all the lyrics and music of this powerful musical only made the strong impact the show had on me even stronger.  Anyone who has ever:  written anything, had their basic values challenged, lost anyone, faced a Big Bad of their own, been depressed, or wanted to compose a whole musical in their lifetime:  buy it.  You might have to listen to it a few times if you're not a Scooby and don't know the story line.  But it will be worth it.  And if you are a Scooby,  why are you even reading this before you buy it?  Joss Whedon's a genious.  Trust the man.  Buy the CD.
0805062971|5.0|I'm a big fan of violent books, and violence in general--as long as no one gets hurt.  I've never actually inflicted any violence on a person myself, except for one time that I tried to fight a guy on the side of the road after a fender bender.  He started it, after I said something unpleasant; and then I didn't fare very well.  To make a long story short, I had to have my jaw re-wired, and I couldn't eat solid foods for a long time.  So the point I'm getting at is: I like violence, as long as I'm not directly involved in it.  This book was ideal for someone like me.  It was a rush of adrenaline, and I can still eat solid foods.  Bravo.

B000002H33|5.0|Put quite simply, Metallica has never been better. From the ear-wrenching opener \\"Battery\\" to the brutal stampede that is \\"Damage, Inc.\\", the album's final track, James, Lars, Cliff, and Kirk deliver a true masterpiece. The album is quite long-three songs clock in at over eight minutes, and \\"Battery\\", at over five, is the shortest. What makes this the finest offering from Metallica's deep catalog? A combination of blistering speed, complex arrangements, harmonies, Hetfield's continually maturing vocal talents, and sheer musical brilliance put this album over the top. <BR>Puppets is no doubt the band's finest song-for-song effort. \\"Leper Messiah\\" is a bit substandard, but it's much better than just about all of Metallica's more recent offerings (see Load, ReLoad, and the atrocious St. Anger). \\"Battery\\", a lashing assault on the ears that purely defines speed metal, remains a fan favorite and live staple. The title track, penned by all four members, is widely regarded as one of the band's best songs. Speed and time changes, a beautiful interlude showcasing the band's melodic side, and a vicious main riff mark this epic. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" is a ballad in the mold of \\"One\\" (off 1988's ...And Justice for All), beginning with a fine intro by Hammett and ending in pure rage and riffage. \\"Orion\\", the album's instrumental offering, features a brilliant break halfway through, full of harmonies and melody penned almost entirely by the late Burton. \\"Disposable Heroes\\" and \\"Damage, Inc.\\" are fast-paced thrashers, sure to please fans of Kill `Em All, while \\"The Thing that Should Not Be\\" is brooding and incredibly heavy.<BR>Following Burton's untimely death in September of 1986, Metallica would never be the same, and had he not passed away, it's interesting to project on the direction the band would have taken. At any rate, Puppets is unquestionably Metallica's best album and a true standard bearer for their legacy.
B00006ADG8|5.0|The difference between Law and Justice was driven home to me by this film.  I was a junior at Cal when I first saw it.  Every inflection, every nuance is just perfect - it is truly as if you are there.  A parable, a ripping yarn, to see it is to be stunned by it.  I graduated and went to law school, now I am among the top 11% of lawyers in the country [Martindale-Hubbell &quot;av&quot;] and the story this movie tells still sticks in my mind as the perfect example of why the law can not always achieve justice.  A real trial lawyers movie - up there with 12 Angry Men, Judgment at Neurenburg, etc
B000002H6C|5.0|Following the release of 1986's epic Master of Puppets, Metallica lost legendary bassist Cliff Burton in a tragic bus accident while touring. Recruited was now-departed thrasher Jason Newsted, and the band entered the studio to follow up on their landmark effort. Despite Justice being slightly under the standard Puppets set, it's nothing short of an outstanding release.<BR>\\"Blackened\\", the opener and one of the few `Tallica tracks actually penned by Newsted, ranks among the band's best songs. It's heavy, wickedly fast, and full of brilliant work by axeman Kirk Hammett and drummer Lars Ulrich. \\"Eye of the Beholder\\", though a bit repetitive, is incredibly heavy with a killer groove; frontman James Hetfield's voice sounds outstanding during the bridges. \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\", Metallica's most violent offering ever, also has a place among their best tunes. It's heavy, mean, and packed with riffs. \\"To Live is to Die\\" is another animal, however. Essentially a compilation of unreleased material written by Burton before his untimely death, it's a ten-minute opus arranged by Hetfield and Ulrich. No less than thirteen different riffs are found. The melodic interlude halfway through is vintage Burton and hearkens back to the Puppets days. \\"One\\" is a truly brilliant offering, and many consider it to be Metallica's best song ever. It begins with the sound of machine gun fire, followed by a beautiful crystalline intro. The last four minutes of the song are vintage Metallica, full of blazing speed, heavy riffing, fantastic solos by Hammett, and harmonies. Finally, \\"Dyers Eve\\" is genuinely vicious and bears comparison to \\"Damage Inc.\\", the closer from Puppets. It's five-plus minutes of pure thrash and will no doubt please fans of Kill `Em All.<BR>Justice undoubtedly includes Ulrich's finest work, and Hetfield's signature growl is at near perfection throughout. The song structure is incredibly complex nearly everywhere on the album, and the harmonies used by the band on Puppets areset to a meaner, heavier, faster groove here. \\"The Shortest Straw\\" is the only track that disappoints. Despite being buried in the middle of the album, \\"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\\" is an above-average offering that bests nearly everything Metallica has recently released. The title song, while a bit drawn out at nearly ten minutes, is another fine track. In short, Justice no doubt ranks among the band's top three releases.
B000059HAI|5.0|I bought this DVD for my Dad for father's day and he was ecstatic.  This movie was far ahead of its time for movie making and war filming in particular.  If you enjoyed &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; you will totally dig this DVD.  Based on a battle during WWII, this movie will draw you in and spit you out with a better understanding of the Japanese mindset prior and during WWII.  I know my Dad enjoyed this DVD and so will you.  A<br />Joseph Dworak
B000092ZYY|5.0|'The Bends' and 'OK Computer' are (and have always been) two of my favourite albums, and Radiohead are undoubtedly the best live act I've ever seen. Subsequently, each time they have released a new album, I have experienced anticipatory excitement, followed by bitter disappointment upon listening. After two disappointing albums, most bands would have lost me. However, I always hoped that Radiohead would win me back. They have certainly done so with 'Hail to the Thief'. Regardless of whether this marks a regression in the band's sound or the next logical progression, it's basically a great album to listen to. I recommend it to anyone who stopped following the band as a result of 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac'. I was a little dubious during the first listen, but I absolutely loved it by the second. Stand out tracks for me include 'There There' and 'A Wolf at the Door'. If you once loved Radiohead but got lost somewhere along the way, come back! This is great!
B00005AQF7|5.0|I heard the hype for years so I finally decided to get this album for myself.  After one listen I agree with everyone, this album is amazing.  The \\"sequel\\" to Dre's Chronic is a more than worthy follow up.  <br />My favorite song on this CD and all-time: Murder Was the Case<br />I would be satisfied with this CD if ONLY that song was on it, BEST EVER.<br />There is not legitely bad song on this CD, you can pop it in your car and listen through the whole thing.  The skits before the songs are funny and not annoying.  This is a must buy.
0790736918|5.0|Unbelievably, I have just seen this film for the first time, which is an embarressing admission from someone who fancies themself something of a classic film buff. Westerns have never been my favorite, other than Roy Rogers shorts. I can usually watch them for about an hour, and then a dusty boredom starts to set in. But this film totally captivated me. The director Ford/star Wayne pairing was a famous collaboration, starting with \\"Stagecoach\\", another classic, in 1939. In this film, they both reach their peak. Though I grew up watching John Wayne movies, and had a kind of mildly amused understanding of his legend, I always got the impression he was just barreling his way through his roles. In this film, everything he was and represented comes together in a portrayal of steel determination, you DON'T mess with John Wayne. As the man on a mission to avenge the slaughter of his brother's family by \\"The Indians\\", and the search for his kidnapped little niece, his performance is totally enthralling. Jeffery Hunter, who was probably the prettiest of all the pretty boys (John Derek, Robert Wagner, Tony Curtis, etc....) that rose to stardom in the 1950's, convincingly plays the adopted part Indian nephew, who escaped the slaughter of Wayne's brother's family, and joins him on his search. Natalie Wood, though her  role is small as the grown kidnapped \\"Debbie\\", never the less was a fitting choice for the sympathetic portrayal, as she was the 1950's girl that everyone wanted for a daughter. The supporting cast is a \\"Who's -Who\\" of great character actors. The famous cinematography totally lives up to it's legend, it's desert hues are breathtaking. And, the famous final shot, which I guess everyone in the world but myself has already seen, well, I choked watching it, not only because of the visual impact of that moment, but for the realization of the irretrievable passing of this kind of film, star, director...This is a wonderful movie experience, that has AMERICAN written all over it, and totally explains the fascination with and the exalted place in movie history of \\"The Duke.\\"over it, and totally explains the fascination with and the exalted place in movie history of \\"The Duke.\\"
B00008S2VG|4.0|I do not like this yet but I know Madonna has to grow on you. I already used one piece in class for discussion and got some very interesting responses going! Want to argue against materialism? Maybe this is a great way to get the class going. Be careful! Maybe I should have gotten the clean version -- my old ears missed some of the words but the class caught them.
B00005JLT5|5.0|There have been many films over the years dealing with the Holocaust and the atrocities in Europe during the Second World War. The best known of course is, Schindler's List. While Schindler's List will be the film by which all other films about this dark period of history will be judged, it has met its match in The Pianist. While Schindler gave us the viewers the story of one very flawed man who saved many lives in the guise of Jewish Labor, The Pianist is far different. The story of one man who managed to survive Warsaw during the Occupation and was ultimately the reciepant of some kindness from the most unlikely person,a German solider. The difference between the two films is that while Schindler's took a rather aneseptic and 'Hollywood' view of the flawed man Oskar Schindler, The Pianist drew on the real life experiences of its director to make the film much more personal. It  not only becomes personal to the director himself, but to the viewer. Polanski himself was a boy during the Occupation, injected small things that he remembered during the Occuapation into the film. Little things like someone telling Spzilman not to run as he is pulled from the lines of people, including his family, being forced into cattle cars on their way to a certain death.It is things like this that bring the viewer closer to the characters and even to the director. Adrien Brody gave the performance of his life in this film. It deserved every Oscar it got and  it is a true masterpiece to be treasured.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Everyone who knows rock, and the majorty who don't, know of Led Zeppelin.  They will forever be a massive impact on music history and a shining example of a sum being greater than its parts.  Much like The Beatles, it's hard to believe how much of an impact they had in their relatively short span.<br />For any Zeppelin fan or indeed any music fan, this DVD is a must.  I find it quite amazing that this 2 DVD set is as cheap as it is because the content is priceless and in this day and age, a rare example of true value for money.  Although the set is packed with glorious moments I am very partial to the opening of the second DVD, an absolutely stunning version of 'Immigrant Song' that makes the album version seem, dare I say...lame.  It's just an absolute stunner and, honestly, I would've started off the whole package with it myself because it's a real mood-setter for the rest of the content.  I recommend turning that volume knob as high as you can get away with when you insert the second DVD and be prepared to sit there slack-jawed. <br />Another thing I found very interesting and that cracked a huge smile on my face is one of the bonus materials that's included on the first DVD which is of them doing a 4-song set (which runs for an amazing 31 minutes) for Danmarks Radio in 1969.  About 30 teenagers get to sit cross-legged around them (my God, little did they know the history they were getting to watch unfold before them) and at first they're not too sure what to make of it but by the end they're bobbing their heads and the band have them eating out of their hands.  It's just very funny if you look at it from a historical aspect and what would happen to the bands popularity and the impact they would have on people throughout their career; talk about a precursor.  In this pathetically sad era of manufactured, corporate rock and rap rubbish that's spewed out and forced onto radio and T.V. in an effort to make money one only has to watch this little 4-song set to see what real charisma, talent, dedication and musicianship can do.  Led Zeppelin won over that little audience in a matter of 30 minute's with no advertising, colouring books, clothes, pens, backpacks and all the other b.s. you can't help but trip over these days.<br />It's all about the music...and to word play off one Mr. Robert Plant on the DVD in 'Stairway to Heaven':<br />\\"Do you remember Led Zeppelin?  Priceless.\\"
B000002UJQ|3.0|I used to like this a lot more. It is a good album (not as good as the bends however) but somehow it has not aged well. I find myself not playing it a lot nowadays.<br />Other milestones have aged better (Dark side, Automatic for the people, Time out of mind etc)
0452282152|1.0|I read this on the recommendation of several friends and, even a passerby who saw me reading it, all of whom were very enthusiastic about it.  So, I was extremely disappointed to discover that it wasn't very good.<br />I found the central character, Griet, to be a pompous, priggish young woman with an overinflated sense of her own position in society and far too calculating for the persona she is supposed to be.  Nearly everyone else was without any substance.  Vermeer is very cold, almost mute and there is no clue to his thoughts at all.  He just comes and goes as if he's in a trance.  His wife is one-dimensionally nasty.  The children, Griet's family and the other maid are stock characters (the bully, the good child, the baby, the threatened co-worker, the poor but proud parents, etc.).  About the only real personalities are Vermeer's mother-in-law and the butcher's son who eventually marries Griet.  I actually liked the mother in law best.  She seemed to have some three dimensionality.<br />However, I did think the description of the housework they had to do was interesting.  Presumably, this is due to the influence of Simon Schama's excellent book \\"The Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretaion of Dutch Culture in the Golden Age\\".<br />On the other hand, I found her description of the camera obscura almost unintelligible, even though, as an art historian, I've had the opportunity to see the view through one. (I'm a 17th century specialist, altough my area of specialization is Italian and French art, not Dutch).  A great opportunity for a good scene was missed there.  Ms. Chevalier's Vermeer could have explained how he used the projected image in preparing and painting his pictures, but this wasn't done.<br />If you want to know something about 17th Century Holland, read Schama's book and there are many excellent art historical studies of Vermeer.  Don't waste your money on this book.

B00005B36H|4.0|I just recentally got into Tool, so I am going to frame this review with that frame of mind, so if there are any other people out there reading this who are just getting into Tool, or are curious about them and want to know more, I might be able to give you a good idea about them.<BR>     &quot;Lateralus&quot; at first seems pretty repetitive.  The first listen of this album, as with any Tool effort, is the hardest to get through.  It's difficult to see what the appeal is.  But this CD, like most of the great art in the world, {yes, I said art}, has to grow on you, and grow it did.<BR>     The lyrics are simply amazing.  There are very few lyricists in music today that can compare to Maynard, he has wonderful insight and a terrific sense of poetry, {ex. lyrics, from 'The Grudge': &quot;Let the waters kiss and transmutate these leaden grudes into gold.&quot; &quot;Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity, calculate what we will or will not tolerate, desperate to control all and everything, unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.&quot;} For a better idea, check out the band's website and look at the lyrics, {toolband.com} and you'll see how good they are.  Maynard sings them with unrestrained passion.<BR>     The music is amazing.  It really does take you on a journey, and some of the concepts on the album are pretty out there, {see the songs &quot;Disposition&quot;, &quot;Triad&quot;, &quot;Reflection&quot;, which make up the climax and resolution to the album, an opus that lasts over twenty minutes, followed by a truly creepy epilogue, &quot;Faaid De Oiad.}  The band doesn't really stray too far out of the usual musical ideals {a la Nine Inch Nails} but they use their drums, guitar and bass to full effect.  Indeed they do try to cross threshholds here, and really try to make you think outside the lines.<BR>     One of my personal favorite songs on the album is &quot;The Patient&quot;, a song that is very positive {in my interpreatation anyway}, a song that is very indicitive of the rest of the album.  Whereas their last effort, &quot;AEnima&quot; was a negative, brooding opus that seemed to want to flush out the bad, this one is the aftermath of the cleansing.  There is a certain feel to this album, one of grab life by the arm and run as fast as you can, if that makes any sense.  Seize the moment, enjoy this life for what it is, and try to see beyond the boundaries of the human condition.<BR>     If all this sounds kind of far out and exaggerated, just check out the album, and you'll see that Tool really do explore these concepts and more, and break new ground in a tired old genre.
B00006AW2M|2.0|I admit, for a long time I underestimated RS 60's output from Aftermath onward. <br />However, on this album they jump the bandwagon and sound like a drunk cliche. Not only un-Stones like or badly played (which can be excusable if the material is great or if the energy is there) but it's like a 6th generation carbon copy of good trippy music. <br />Hello boys! In abandoning regular rock song structure, please replace it with something more than this. Only she's a rainbow stands the test of time (and is a really fun / great song)

The graphics [were] so bad, it wouldn't even scare a little kid, it would probably make him laugh. My advice don't rent this movie or buy it, but if you like horrible actors and really bad graphics then go for it, but you'll regret watching it, trust me. P.S. don't watch the second one either.
B00006AW2G|4.0|Together with Beggars'Banquet, this is one of the most varied RS albums: rock, ballads, country, coupled with great playing.<br />I only bought it recently, having more focused on Sticky fingers, Exile and beyond, but this is really one of the better albums of the 60's

B0000025T6|5.0|Sometimes you can listen to a particular music album many times and just get the same feeling from it over and over again. But  yet in just one listen you feel as if it really hits you in the \\"right place\\".  I've just finished listening to Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska and that has just happened to me.  I've come to the conclusion that Nebraska in a sense is probably springsteen's finest hour...although, musically speaking, I still leave Darkness On the Edge of Town just slightly above it.  On Nebraska Bruce I think opens up himself in a way like he has never done before or since.  By telling these \\"stories\\" of hard times and spiritual desolation he is in essence talking about his own darkness and tribulations that have followed him for most of his own life. What literally scares me about this album is that I think in certain ways it is honestly and brutally reflective of many many people in this country at this particular time.  I guess being from N.J.I feel a strong sense of where springsteen is coming from (I guess literally LOL) but actually what he's trying to say about the horrific aftermath of a troubled economy and just simply trying to keep up with a FAST paced world.  I think Bruce is really trying to carry us on his shoulders with this one and tries to really make the point of what it feels like to be walking on a thin thin line, pretty much a synonym for the state that this country seems to be in right now.  But the album not only works lyrically but musically as well.  The dark sounds of the harmonica and a subtle guitar really capture a lonely and emotionally wrenching atmosphere.  I mean with Bruce just by himself one can sense with the sound and the lyrics of the record as if he's almost cutting himself off from the rest of the world which can easily become reflective of the feeling of the characters on the album.  All I can say is that I highly reccomend this c.d. because I think it really sums up what Bruce Springsteen is all about. And through anysorrow or hard times anybody might be going through I think Bruce wants everybody to know in this darkness we will ultimatly find our own reason to believe!
B00007LTIL|4.0|They go back to their roots here, sound like a rough version of CSN (&amp;Y) who taught them harmonies, and they actually write some good songs. <br />Live, they would morph into altogether different beasts but this album stands out as one of their best (and un-GD) albums: concise, i.e. present the musical ideas, but not work out the myriad of different variations on the theme, as they would do live. Great easy listening.
B00005TT77|5.0|Even before I bought this album, I was surprised at the comparative lack of obvious covers. Of the songs featured here, perhaps the most frequently covered are Let it be, We can work it out and Nowhere man. Yesterday and In my life are conspicuous by their absence. Classic songs like Strawberry fields forever and Lucy in the sky with diamonds are rarely covered, so their inclusion here is most welcome.<br />Having listened to it, what really surprised me about this album is how mellow it is. Most of the album seems to have been recorded with a certain amount of restraint, even where the pace picks up a little as on I'm looking through you. This is a very modern album in which the songs sound very different to the original versions, but that (at least) is what expected..<br />With various artists albums, favorite tracks often depend on who your established opinion of the various performers. I haven't followed rock music as closely in recent years as I once did so I am not familiar with their other work. I was particularly impressed with Sarah McLachlan, who recorded Blackbird. However, many of the other tracks are also impressive.<br />I have a number of Beatles tribute albums and while this is not my favorite, it is very interesting. It will help to remind young people of the Beatles' legacy, as so many of the performers here will be familiar to them. It will also tell oldies like me that contemporary rock, at its best, has plenty to offer.
B00006AW2J|4.0|Together with Let it bleed one of the most varied RS albums. Buy it today and enjoy. What actually stands out is the production: in the 70's they often soudend somewhat muddy on studio albums (except for acoustic ballads like Angie) but here they sound crisp and clean. Great!
6305907145|5.0|I rate this movie five stars only because of it's cast and filming and in no way how true it is to the book. If I were to judge the movie based on it's accuracy it would recieve one star. If you are wanting to see this movie because you have not the time to read the book by all means see the movie but know that it is flawed in most ways and is very decieving as to the actual characters Jane Austen invented. Fanny Price was one of Austens least favorite characters and was acutally very irritating to most of her readers. Unlike in the movie where she is a very agreeable character. Most of the characters in the movie were protrayed very differently then the book. But if you wanting to see this movie for the sake of just enjoying it then it is such a great movie. The casting was wonderful right down to the evil Mrs. Norris.
B00008S2VG|3.0|After RAY OF LIGHT, it had seemed that Madonna could do no wrong--even when she did (her silly cover of \\"American Pie\\"), she seemed to get away with it unscathed. RAY OF LIGHT's sequel, MUSIC, seemed to push Madonna's talent even further, with her brand of dance-pop, laced with electronic beats. AMERICAN LIFE, however does not push ahead, as the other RAY or MUSIC do--in fact, the album seems to show Madonna screeching to a halt. As if there's nothing left for her to do with the techno-pop blend, Madonna seems to be at a stalemate. What is especially frustrating with this record, is that at its best, there is some of Madonna's best work on it--but the peaks are far too few and in between.<BR>The title track, is interesting, although rather self-involved. The rap does sound silly, but again, as with some missteps before, she does pull it off. What is admirable is the lyrics, questioning the values that Madonna herself, seem to embody. The risks and the candor are breathtaking, and the song would be great, if it were not for the singer's smug delivery. The other song in which Madonna tries for Debbie Harry-rap is \\"Mother and Father\\"--which works--incredibly. One of her strongest, and most introspective tunes, the song's lyrics are moody ruminations on her mother's death, and her father's reaction afterwards. Instead of being a morose ballad, however, the lyrics are encased in a candy-disco beat, with girlish-icy vocals, that stop the song from being maudlin. The other high points include \\"Nothing Fails,\\" a stirring ballad, with a gorgeous backing choir, and the dance-ditty \\"Nobody Knows Me,\\" which is the only song that seems to have a chance to become a dance-club hit. The other songs (including the monotonous hit, \\"Die Another Day\\"), all seem to show Madonna at her worse. The ballads, including \\"Hollywood\\" and \\"Easy Ride\\" show the Material Girl trying to be a Joni Mitchell-type singer-songwriter, when she does not possess neither the lyrical prowess, nor the vocal talent to pull it off. The songs are sung in her tinny thin voice, and are backed by a guitar that usually strums the same two or three chords--which makes one suspect that Madonna herself is trying to play the guitar on the record. <BR>The high points on the album are remarkable, and show how interesting and provocative Madonna can be. She also shows that unlike Whitney Houston, Prince or Michael Jackson, she is one of the few pop music icons, that can still make relevant music, independent of hype and image. Unfortunately, the majority of the record shows Madonna at her worst--pretentious and self-important.
B0000026SF|4.0|Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fun to rip on &quot;80s metal&quot; - but this is an overlooked gem. Before Europe went commercial, this -- and the follow up, Wings Of Tomorrow -- are their two best and hold up very well critically if you can be open minded and get past your anti-&quot;hair metal&quot; sentiments. Of course, if you're reading this, you probably don't have those sentiments - but anyway.  If you want to be surprised - or you heard &quot;Final Countdown&quot; and want something more - get this.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Bleep bleep.  Gurgle gurgle.  KerPLUNK.  Wiggle wibble.  So started the last two Radiohead studio albums to much bemusement and head-scratching by the critics and record buying public alike.  As signals of intention they were not misleading. Although by far the most electronically influenced of the tracks on either of the albums, they still indicated a restless band who had grown weary of the four to the floor dynamics/constraints of a rock band.<br />In contrast, Hail To The Thief kicks off with \\"2 + 2 = 5\\".  A quiet, moody introduction with drum patters and intricate guitar lines clambering all over Thom's voice suddenly does the unimaginable after a minute and a half.  Someone stabs a syringe into the band members' hearts and pumps them with a buzzing adrenaline shot.  Thom spits out \\"You have not been paying attention\\" leaving the rest of the band with nothing to do but savagely attack their instruments in a rock and roll orgy of violence and paranoia.  It becomes easily one of the most exciting moments of Radiohead's recorded history.  If on the second listen the freak out fry up is less of a surprise, it is none the less satisfying as the build-up tantalises and teases before unleashing and releasing the monster.<br />The sound is raw and natural, and comes back throughout the album.  Jonny Greenwood does things to the guitar that probably warrant sexual harassment law-suits during \\"Go To Sleep\\".  \\"Where I End And You Begin\\" sees a serial-killer stalker of a bassline snuggle up to The Edge's industrial guitars circa Achtung Baby to mesmerising effect.  \\"Myxomatosis\\" sounds like Queens of the Stone Age having a drunken grapple with a Euro techno-trance floor-filler inside Thom's head (or possibly headache).  Nagging backing vocals weave between colossal, continental drift drums and Yorke's lonely voice, stitching the two delicately together on \\"There There\\".<br />Other songs are beautifully sung, bittersweet lullabies designed to paralyse.  None has quite the immediate grab of a \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" or \\"True Love Waits\\", but \\"Sail To The Moon\\"'s haggard, woozy, scrunched-up-ball of a tune haunts the memory.  Meanwhile, Thom's duet with the voices in his head on the devoted \\"I Will\\" is nothing short of stunning.<br />Even more gripping is \\"We Suck Young Blood\\"'s return to the smoky, jazz-flecked stylings of Amnesiac's \\"Life in a Glasshouse\\".  Over a mournful piano Radiohead suddenly come up with the sound of one hand clapping, and it's fair to say that it is somewhat less than half as joyful as those on The Undertones' \\"Teenage Kicks\\".  Yorke's vocals and lyrics portray some crazed devil tempting poor earthly souls, and indeed three-fifths of the way in the music twists and gives us an insight into the flame-licked, scorching after-party for all of ten seconds.  Then it cuts back to Thom, singing sweetly for your pity while secretly stealing your purse.<br />This is not to say the record is flawless.  When the electronics take over, rather than support, the more conventional sounds the results are merely cold and unmoving.  The lack of emotion is completely unrepresentative of the album as a whole, but leaves a nasty aftertaste that can detract from other tracks.  \\"The Gloaming\\" and \\"Backdrifts\\" are particularly frustrating in this regard, as they are nestled in such places as to pull the plug on any build up of momentum, making the whole record a curiously, and infuriatingly, stop-start affair.<br />Only with the final songs does Hail To The Thief find a track it can stick to without toppling off, resulting in the glorious reward of the finale, \\"A Wolf At The Door\\".  Over a faintly psychotic fairground-waltz setting, Thom launches into a hypnotically rhythmic rant.  Then the refrain arrives and for some absurdly fantastic reason, such is the sheer joy of the melody, it sounds faintly as if Julie Andrews is guest starring.  Well, a drugged-up Julie Andrews who hasn't slept for 4 months, singing, \\"I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up calls me on the phone tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up - Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom and I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops...\\".<br />It provides a perfect ending to a record that is sad, lonely, angry, paranoid and all the more accurate for being so ragingly inarticulate.  Moreover, it cements Radiohead as the one of the very few rock bands out there, who aren't afraid of getting their wings singed for the pay-off of rocketing into the Sun.  And for that we should be thankful.
B00000264F|4.0|Top to bottom, the best Europe release, by far. If you're a fan of '80s metal, but aren't sure about Europe because all you heard was the schlock of Final Countdown (good schlock, but schlock nonetheless), buy this.  Not a bad track here.  Guitarist John Norum is outstanding.  Check out his outstanding solo CD as well, called &quot;Total Control&quot; ... Went on to be a quite able replacement for George Lynch in Dokken.<br />This CD holds the original version of &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; which was bastardized two CDs later. &quot;Aphasia&quot; is one of the best metal instrumentals of all time - and &quot;Dreamer&quot; is one of my favorite mellow tunes of the era/genre.
B00009P1O0|5.0|Finally, Finally...4 of the lost 6 are available on CD. 'On The Beach', once deemed subpar upon release and ignored, has now gained legendary status among critics and Neil's fans, probably in large part to its &quot;vinyl only&quot; status--not even available on cassette! 'On The Beach', 'Time Fades Away' and 'Tonights The Night' are Neil's greatest trilogy, each hated when they came out since everyone wanted another 'Harvest'. Now everyone knows differently. I have come to prefer the harrowing songs of 'On The Beach' more than the more popular 'Night.' (save for the greatest road song ever written, &quot;Albuquerque.&quot;) The deeply expressive &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; involves many things--Neil's personal trials regarding the people around him, the end of the 60's, and Watergate. &quot;Revolution Blues&quot; and &quot;On The Beach&quot; evoke an anger at the society of the times and represent Neil's most effective songwriting. <br />If you are curious about all four of these formerly &quot;lost&quot; albums, but not sure which to buy, make certain &quot;On The Beach&quot; is the first. The other three are not nearly as artistically strong or interesting, save for &quot;Like A Hurricane&quot; on 'American Stars and Bars', a collection of unreleased tracks in 1977. However, all four are still essential to Neil's fans or completists. Hopefully they will be able to get &quot;Time Fades Away&quot; remastered eventually--the master tapes, I've heard, have some mastering problems that can't be overcome at the moment.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|I was hoping for something original from this movie. What is the point of merely rehashing Wells' &quot;Time Machine?&quot; I thought this movie would show some new perspective, some interesting nuance, a dimension of the future I have not even thought about. I was disappointed. <br />While intellectually this movie is vacant, it has decent special effects and good, albeit short, acting by Jeremy Irons. Look, H.G. Wells was scandalized by two important world-historic events that took place in Victorian England: the widespread scientific acceptance of the theory of evolution and the transformation of society due to the Industrial Revolution. His original &quot;Time Machine&quot; is an imaginative and socially conscious fusion of these occurrences presented in the form of the written word. But why would the movie made in 2002, made as it was in a different historical era, divorced from the same historical circumstances, would want to agonize over Victorian fears? The fears of which the current generation as a whole has no inkling. What do 99 percent of the people living in America today know of the horrors of 19th century factories, miserable working class lifestyles, and the shock to the conscience of decent God-fear proper people triggered by the spread of the theory of evolution?<br />There is a minor new twist in this film. I want to be completely fair, you see. The movie does not blame class division or industrialization per se for the catastrophe of the human race being divided into two: one effete and docile, another predatory and unconscionable. But greed and the desire for good life are blamed. Apparently some corporation was building a resort on the Moon, and the explosion conducted as a part of the construction process, broke the whole Moon into several pieces, changing the orbit of the Earth and its climate. Those greedy corporations with their constant hunt for profits! And what about the decadent people who fuel the demand for their services! Imagine, these lazy, conspicuous consumption folks--they want to vacation on the Moon!<br />In the end, I did not care. The Morlocks could eat all the Eloi, if they wanted to. What's it to me? Near the end of this fiasco, Guy Pearce lectures Jeremy Irons about the &quot;human cost&quot; involved in the food chain arrangement on Earth. That is such a 20th century liberal phrase, that upon hearing it, I became even more conscious that this movie does not take its viewers 800,0000 years forward. It simply takes them back into the ideology of the Left. Hollywood don't preach. I love your movies, just do not lecture me.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Ok, if you haven't already seen Fight Club, then go out to a parking lot and beat yourself silly. If you have seen Fight Club, you got that.<br />Ed Norton plays the narrator, a nameless character who's dissappointed by his professional life, his love life, and the world he lives in. A character who could be any one of us. Enter Tyler Durden. Tyler is a man who scoffs at rules, society, and social norms. Tyler is a man who is dangerously smart, and even more dangerously charming.<br />When a series of events bring the two together, things begin to happen.<br />Men once tested their valor and courage in battle, but of late we've been taught that fighting is wrong, to avoid confrontation.<br />But Tyler encourages a generation of disenchanted men to embrace their aggression, to channel it, and to make use of it.<br />Only problem is, Tyler has big plans for society, and there's little to stop him.<br />Learn the frightening ease with which soap can be made deadly. Learn the art of self-destruction.<br />Most of all, get some aspirin for the twist ending if you're watching this for the first time.
B000001Y5D|4.0|I really enjoy the sound of the 4 Non-Blondes.  Their earnest, pleading and straight forward singing style really makes for good listening.  My favorites are of course &quot;What's Up&quot; but I also really enjoy &quot;Spaceman&quot; and &quot;Drifting&quot;.<br />These songs make for great road music.  You'll find yourself belting out the lyrics as though you wrote them.  I hope this group reforms even if only for one reunion album.  It's been over a decade since this album came out but it has stood the test of time and is still as good to as it was then
B000089RVX|4.0|I have to disagree with what people say that is is \\"goth\\" rock. I would say this is more like Theater rock. You know, the type of songs you would find in a movie or a stage performance (and with authority. The single \\"Bring Me To Life\\" is on the Daredevil soundtrack). And the team up of someone writing the songs for his friend (?) seems something like the team up of Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman when they released Bat Out Of Hell in 1977, though a little darker, not as overblown, and not as long as any Steinman song out there. However, the writer of these tracks, Ben Moody, could've written these just for the voice of  Amy Lee, who makes a perfect performance on this CD, with minor downfalls which shouldn't let you down any.<br />The best tracks are, of course, the single, Bring Me To Life (just don't turn on the radio. We know how much those people want to play it to death), My Immortal, Hello, Whisper, and Tourniqueit.  The stand out track for me is My Immortal. It is bone chilling and saddening (plus, the overlay of this track on the WWE's farewell video to \\"Classie\\" Freddy Blassie (he died just last week) made that video a tear-jerker), plus it is Amy's best performance on the CD. That song was written especially for her voice, it seems, and it sounds like she knows what she is doing in the studio. <br />The other tracks are great, but the guitar riffs sometimes overpower Amy's voice, which is what this CD should've carried on throughout. Not to say that the guitars weren't good, but I want to hear Amy once more. Also, it seems that some tracks do seem like they blend with each other. This would be good for a Broadway show, or another type of stage show, but in today's CD market, some people will dismiss it as not being original.<br />Still, this theater rock is a new presence, and a breath of fresh air. With a bit more effort and more desire ton use Amy's voice to carry a tune rather than the combination of gutiars and her, it would be Ben and Amy that could pulloff another Jim and Meat. Don't let the haters nor the overplay of the single from it scare you off. This is one of the best acts to come into the limelight in a long time, and one in which you will enjoy.
B000MV8ABS|4.0|Viewed: 6/03, 10/07, 6/11<br />Rate: 7<br /><br />10/07: Phantasm is an excellently directed horror picture but suffers from being minimalist in an abstract way. If what had happened through Phantasm is a dream, then what I saw must be either a waste of time or the boy has an overstretched imagination. I think Phantasm had the elements right on in order to make an effective horror picture, and sometimes it is frightening. But much of the time, Phantasm is tedious. The brotherly relationship between Jody and Mike is one of the best parts of Phantasm. Then, there is the Tall Man, played by Angus Scrimm, who is widely considered the most memorable of the Phantasm series. But to me, the more memorable villain of the picture is the steel ball. I could never forget the steel ball's impact on Phantasm. One scene is especially unforgettable is when the steel ball flies in the air and stings the groundskeeper in the head before drilling through his forehead and pumping blood out. When I think of that, the special effects work has to be first rate in Phantasm. However, the story is almost nonexistent. It's also a bizarre movie to watch (which is probably not a negative), and Phantasm works well with very minimal story. Sometimes, I couldn't help but feel that if some meat is added to Phantasm, it would have been a great picture. Of course, I am not going to see any film that starts off with two young adults having sex in a cemetery. Why would anyone do that? As far as the series goes, there is very, very little clarification what does the whole thing all mean. I hope there will be Phantasm V sometime in the future that will explain it all. Regardless, Phantasm belongs on the list of great horror films. Different, unique, and odd, Phantasm manages to impress me in different ways yet I can't explain what the movie is all about. Now, cue in the Tall Man, B-O-O-O-O-Y-Y-Y!<br /><br />6/11: Remember one thing when you see Phantasm: it's all a dream as the title indicates. Of course, nothing in the film makes sense. That's why Phantasm remains one of the most bizarre films to date. It's easy to come back to it again and again and try to make sense of it all. Once again, not a lot of it makes sense except it's only an illusion. I wish that the three sequels would explain more of the mystery but turned out to be full of air. There is a lot of memorable parts about the film, but I have my own set: the random sex in cemetery, the famous steel ball, and the dwarves getting Michael in bed while The Tall Man is lurking over behind. Some of the lines are still easily memorized. One of them is, \\"You play a good game boy, but the game is finished. Now you die.\\" All in all, Phantasm remains a worthy film to see just to experience its bizarreness.lm makes sense. That's why Phantasm remains one of the most bizarre films to date.

0140186395|5.0|Steinbeck surely created a masterpiece here as he explored themes such as love, hate, and knowledge. He wove an intricate web of characters and plots into a beautiful tapestry of american writing. <BR>The story follows the interaction of 3 families: the Trasks, Hamitons, and the whorehouse owned by \\"Cathy Trask\\". The Trask family is bound to horribly repeat the story of Cain and Abel over and over again. It teaches us of our most devestating flaws and our most vital goods. This is a must read for any lover of great literature!!
B00008OWZC|5.0|Man! what a great cd. this shows led zeppelin in their prime! led zeppelin is one of the greatest bands ever. this has all their great hits plus other tracks that you'll love. if your new to led zeppelin this is a great live cd of theirs to get. if your not new to zeppelin it's a great one to add to the collection. LED ZEPPELIN ROCKS!!
B00006RCSR|5.0|No magic (real life fiction).  A short movie, I only wish it was at least three hours long and it would have everything.<br />I fell in love with this movie. It is that good.  I also bought the book which closly follows the movie. The book too, should have been longer.<br />The stepmother is someone you will love to hate.  Perhaps also, the selffish shallow stepsister so favored by her stepmother.  You will be pleased with what happens to them near the end.  The other stepsister was also mistreated by her mother but all is well at the end.<br />Awful things happen in the movie but the ending makes it a feel-good movie.
B0000028M7|5.0|Great bands often make great albums, but rarely does a band create an album of perfection in which every note, every lyric flawlessly falls into place. Maybe the stars were aligned just right for Alice in Chains on this project. While I am not a huge fan of all of the band's music, DIRT is simply irresistable from start to finish (and man!, what a finish--&quot;Would?&quot; is one of the greatest songs ever recorded, by ANY band, period!). FACELIFT (released before DIRT) is a tad monotonous, while later releases sound a bit lost and unfocussed. DIRT, however, is a gem, a true must-have, that sounds as great today as it did when it came out.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This live set is one of the greatest in history. I remember when I was in the 7th grade and our music teacher let us bring in a new album each friday. I chose my brand new copy of Led Zeppelin II. My teacher thought Jesus Christ Superstar was just magnificant, so you could just imagine his reaction to Zeppelin { he called it crap, and acid rock}.I knew I was on to something great. This 3 cd set has brought back many of the memories of that age, it is viberant, fresh, and a sonic powerhouse, far superior to \\" The Song Remains the Same\\" soundtrack, which I found somewhat ponderous. How anyone could listen to this masterpeice then go back to listening to 90's era criticly acclaimed dreck like Dave Mathews Band is beyond me. This is not only a testiment to 70's era rock, but also points out how todays rock is banal, empty, and lacking in originality, as proven by the new Metallica cd.
B000069AUI|4.0|Definitely not as good as parachutes. not nearly as good. some songls, like clocks nd the scientist, are completely awesome, but others like the title track are below par for coldplay. every song on parachutes was perfect. I like that on rush of blood they're experimenting with radiohead-esque styles, branching out, but sometimes they go too far. chris martin's voice is beautiful and musical and works better on more lyrical songs... oh i will marry that man someday. anyway. this cd is definitely getting some spin time in my player, but a revisitation to older styles my make me very happy with their next record. sigh.
0783229011|4.0|You have kids.<br />You're kids like to read stories (and watch movies) 1,000 of times over and over and over............<br />If ya gotta watch a story several time, this movie is a sure-winner.  There's lots of things in here for both parents and kids.<br />:-)
630521610X|3.0|This movie was an okay (borderline &quot;clever&quot;) idea to begin with, but if it's horror you're looking for, it will simply not be delivered.  It's just too modernized, too hip to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed the light comedy and the countless references to horror movies, but this isn't a masterpiece.  It also doesn't help that the main stalker (&quot;Ghostface&quot;) just seems too down-to-Earth, and I think that any of the teens could (with a little luck) have escaped him, or even murdered him.  Another low factor was that Neve Cambell's character sometimes turned this into a laughable melodrama.  It's a fun movie, but probably not worth a buy.
B00005JKZV|2.0|First off I'm not a purist. I have read the books a half dozen or so times, but I'm OK when the film version deviates from the books... PROVIDED 1) It makes sense and 2) It works. In the first film I was kind of bummed that they didn't have the Barrow-Wight sequence, but you know what? They couldn't have done that without the whole Tom Bombadil thing and that just would not have worked in a movie. So they ditched it. So what. It worked. They substituted characters for the chase where Frodo is wounded and trying to make Rivendell. That's OK too. Because it made sense and it worked.<br />The Two Towers is a mish-mash of bastardized characters, plot points that didn't happen and exised plot points that could have and should have happened (Shelob) and a veering of the plot that, in Tolkien's world, would have rendered the 3rd part impossible to accomplish (showing the ring directly to a Ring Wraith at a time when the forces of darkness assume it's lost and have stopped looking for it.)<br />They screwed up Faramir beyond belief. Gimli is reduced to comic relief. Innocent civilians are brought to the front line of a war when they would have remained safe if they were left behind. They made the Ents out to be so stupid they couldn't tell when their own forest is under attack and sent Frodo and Sam into a part of the world where they have no business being. None of it works and none of it makes any sense.<br />Gollum is done well though which is why this gets 2 stars instead of 1. Part 1 though? 5 stars. Solid. No doubt about it. Here's hoping part 3 is better.
B00001OH7P|5.0|What a great album! This is the one that really got me into David Bowie. I enjoy every song on here, from the rockin' riff in &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot; to the rockin' riff (once again) in &quot;Suffragette City&quot;. I only wish I would've been alive at the time this was released &amp; Bowie was on tour supporting this.
B000000OUE|5.0|Three years after the groundbreaking success of \\"La Sexorcisto Devil Music Volume 1.\\" (A legendarily poor effort in my opinion), White Zombie recorded \\"Astro Creep\\". Many of the fans that had enjoyed \\"La Sexorcisto Devil Music Volume 1\\" expected \\"La Sexorcisto Devil Music Volume 2\\". Many were turned off by the much darker sound of the lead single \\"More Human Than Human\\" in comparison to \\"Thunderkiss 65'\\". The whole album was different than anything they had done since they began in the 1980's.<br />\\"Astro Creep 2000\\" is White Zombie's masterpiece. Whereas \\"La Sexorcisto\\" sounded like backround music and failed to hold my attention, \\"Astro Creep\\" sounds powerful, heavy, and clear. The production on this disc by Terry Date is superb. J's guitar-riffs are loud and clear, and his guitar-lines are memorable and catchy. Sean Yselt gives a good bassy sound throughout. John Temptesta (who debuts here) gives appropriate rhythms. Rob Zombie's vocals are brilliant as he growls his bizarre lyrics.<br />Lyrics are provocative and ridiculous at the same time. They don't deal with anything important. The booklet with the lyrics is odd pornographic stuff, as there are pictures of monsters and naked women. To say that it is weird is an understatement. <br />Standouts: Every song is great. This is too consistent for words, so I will describe each track. \\"Electric Head Part 1\\" starts with sampling for a minute, then explodes into a three minute edge-of-your-seat-intense barrage of guitar riffs. The chorus is catchy if you can understand it. A brilliant opener. \\"Supercharger Heaven\\" has a feel-good vibe and is definitely a fast-driving song. Although the song is structured in a near cliché fashion, it's lyrics are the main point-of-interest here. Lines like, \\"Jesus lived his life in a cheap hotel on the edge of route 66,\\" are just plain silly. Others are rather provocative depending on your point of view. The samples are genius. \\"Real Solution #9\\" starts with a repeating sample of a young woman saying, \\"I'm already dead\\". Then the amazing, ominous main guitar-riff breaks through the speaker. Rob Zombie's vocals will not be understood by someone who is listening for the first time, as they sound robotic. Reading the lyrics will help though. This is an utterly brilliant song, that is a required listen for any White Zombie fan. \\"Creature Of The Wheel\\" has an even more ominous main guitar-riff, and is probably the heaviest song here. Rob Zombie's practically-screaming vocals are a great addition. The samples are genius. \\"Electric Head Part 2\\" is nowhere near as good as part 1, and is the worst song here. But some excellent lyrics and a bouncy guitar-line keep it from being a complete loss. However, this does not take away from the rest of the album. \\"Grease Paint and Monkey Brains\\" takes a little while to get used to. It has a slower backdrop, and sounds a bit like Marilyn Manson. But the rhythm is catchy, and they are very creepy. \\"I, Zombie\\" lulls you in with calm samples. As soon as you hear a woman scream, the guitars crack your skull along with Sean Yselt's bass. It's a similar speed is similar to \\"Electric Head Part 1\\". A definite classic. \\"More Human Than Human\\" has catchy riffs and strange lyrics. It allows Sean Yselt to stand-out, as her work is clearly heard here. \\"El Phantasmo and the Chicken-Run Blast-O-Rama\\"  has a similar vibe to that of \\"Supercharger Heaven\\", and has a forceful guitar-line and screeched vocals from Rob. Although the middle of the song is overlong, and detracts a bit from the actually song, it comes back furious. \\"Blur The Technicolor\\" opens with a suspenseful 20 seconds of drums. The guitar riff begins to interplay with real drums from Temptesta, and then we hear a very strange sounding guitar. I can't quite describe it. The song has a rather complex structure, and intense vocals. To top this off, \\"Blood, Milk, And Sky\\" is a melodic but extremely heavy semi-closer, with some haunting Arabian samples that literally blew my mind the first time I heard it. It's the longest song, clocking at 5:40, but there is a secret track. At 8:40 of the track, you hear an guitar/bass/drumming instrumental that screams \\"applause!\\" It has a very strange and loud piece with Alien sounds, and the final seconds of the song will leave you stunned, as the album comes to a close.<br />Overall, \\"Astro Creep 2000\\" is probably one of the best albums I have ever heard, and is well as a vast improvement over \\"La Sexorcisto\\". Highly recommended.<br />Overall: 5 stars
B0000013G9|5.0|This is an amazing album. \\"Creep\\", \\"Red Light Special\\", and \\"Waterfalls\\" were released when I was in 8th grade, which was in 1994/95, and they are still some of my favorite songs to this date. Nothing compares to the sultry voice of T. Boz in \\"Red Light Special\\", which is THE song to get you and your special someone into the mood... All the songs have great beats and great lyrics and vocals. Favorite songs for me have to be (as mentioned before)\\"Creep, Red Light Special, Waterfalls, Kick Your Game, & Case of the Fake People\\". This is recommended to anyone, regardless of musical tastes. Just about every song on here is accessible to anyone.

B0000683WG|5.0|I only own two T. Rex albums (I know, what a shame...), but out of the two, this is my favorite. Don't get me wrong, Electric Warrior is equally as good, but the songs on this one are a bit more catchy, in my opinion. Maybe it's just me. Either way, T. Rex have some great music.
B00006RU5B|2.0|I'm guessing most of the people who were excited about this album fall in the same categor as me.  We grew up with such bands and Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Pumpkins, and of course Soundgarden and Rage.  Both were great bands, I was never a huge rage fan, but Soundgarden's Superunknown was an incredible album.  But I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but somewhere between Soundgarden's split up and present day, Chris Cornell started to [be bad]. He forgot how to write creative music, and lyrics for that matter.  Anyhow, thats only half my problem with this album.  Its not that Audioslave is a horrible listen.  My problem is that it sounds exactly how you expect it to sound.  There's no creativity here, and the end result is a a series of songs that are either completely forgettable, or will become that radio single that you wish would just go away at the end of summer (a la Staind \\"Its been awhile\\", Nickelback anything, etc).  My advice to you waining grungsters, turn off your radio, stop putting all your eggs in the baskets of the bands that are slowly fading away,  and get on the net check into some of the indie rock thats coming out nowadays (and alls not lost, at least we still have Radiohead)

What great musicians they really are...Throw Down...And They Should Be Together...<br />Thanks Stevie, John, Mick and Lindsey...You just made living in the new millennium fun!  The effort and thought you put into this album brought all of us back to a better place musically, when music meant something and we all felt better for the experience.<br />We are looking forward to seeing you from the 21st row in Portland!<br />This Album Is Fleetwood Mac At Its Best!<BR>Jeff &amp; Ann
B000092ZYX|5.0|After a number of listenings:<BR>Unlike some of the other critics, I would not analyze this record song-by-song, nor would I care to position it on the OK Computer - Kid A continuum. <BR>This record deserves its own place and recognition as one complete work. It has a pace, an ebb-and-flow, that conveys you through the entire record almost without noticing the passage of time. The musical content is solid both on the conventional and &quot;electronic&quot; side of things. <BR>A landmark recording that rivals The Bends and OK Computer as their very best work.

Ed Itzoe u are an idiot becuase u think this is like the actual encounter. this movie is BASED on the true story. the real story may be intresting but this movie is really good. enough about this moron lets talk about the movie. this movie is about a man who is somewhat captured by aliens, and has multiple flashbacks after he is. its a scary movie to see what the aliens do.
0385495323|5.0|Simon Singh can describe tails of drama, history, and common mathematical sense into a great book.  While most people take cryptography for granted, Singh provides historical and simple examples to illustrate it's importance to mathematics and history.  He details it's use in wars, especially World War 2, and commerce.  He even delves into the political ramifications of strong versus weak encryption when discussing PGP.<br />Singh also provides easy to understand ways on how encryption works and even more intriguing, how to break it.  He shows how all various encryption algorithms are done, and then how code breakers can decipher them, both in practical and historical consequences.<br />In the end, he even provides a challenge for would be decipherers out there.  Granted, it's already been solved, it's still education and exciting that he offered a considerable amount of money for this challenge ($15000).<br />All in all, it's a fascinating book that will capture anyone's imagination, even if they hate history or math.

B000002NBY|4.0|It may sound silly, but I was inspired to pick up a copy of this CD after buying The Wild Tornberrys' soundtrack. I'm surprised I didn't buy it in the '80s. I knew most of the &quot;Hits&quot;from the Album  back then, I guess I just never got around to it. It still is quite likable, if not a tad long.If you liked &quot;Father and Daughter&quot; from Thornberrys, you'll love every minute of this CD guarenteed!
1400034779|4.0|I read several Amazon reviews of THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY before picking up a copy myself. It's not often I read a book cover to cover in one sitting, but I couldn't help myself with A.M. Smith's first in this charming series featuring Precious Ramotswe.<br />The biggest plus of the book is the author's descriptions of Precious' life as she sets up her detective agency, after selling livestock left to her by her father. She says that as a young woman, she took a job as a bookkeeper, which showed her she had a knack for figuring not only numbers, but problems in everyday life. Thus the motive for turning her talents to detective work.<br />In this first episode, Precious investigates a man accused of medical fraud, a husband suspected of adultery and another man accused of a horrendous murder. The murder suspect's story was the most disturbing in a book that has an overall playful and cheerful tone. The descriptions are not graphic; rather it is the circumstances of the murder I found unsettling because of the victim's age.<br />Looking very much forward to reading the next books in the series. I do hope Mr. Smith has several more planned beyond the four he has already written.
B00008LDPU|5.0|It was violent, insane, graphic and in some parts grotesque.  I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.  This is what animation should be like in america, not that junk they show you on Cartoon Network or The WB.  The dvd has 9 short films about The Matrix, not the movie but the place (although 4 of the films are tangled into the first 2 matrix films, Final Flight of the Osiris, The Second Renaissance I & II and Kid's story).  I'll be rating the films individualy, as in Amazon.com the highest score is 5 stars, lets begin.     <br />1. The first film \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" tells you who sent Jada Pinket Smiths character the info about the machines digging in \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\".  All CGI, great animation and great story (5 stars).     <br />2. The Second Renaissance I and II- This tells the story of how the machines came into power.  This is the one that is graphic and not really for kids but I let my 5 and 10 year old cousins see it and they seemed to like it.  What they didn't understand I explained to them and it sounds like most of you people who didn't like this DVD need to come over to my house so I can explain all of these 'simple to understand if your above 10 years old' plots for you. Great animation and great story (5 stars for both).     <br />3. Kids Story-  It's about a teen that knows there's something more out there.  He knows about Neo, Trinity and the rest but he doesn't know how to get to them.  I liked the action on the skateboard and the kind of animation they used was new to me, I had not seen animation like that before (5 stars).     <br />4. Program- A women is in a training program and her Boyfriend enters, telling her that he is tired of living in the real world.  He tells her that he knows a way back to the Matrix and asks her to come along.  Kind of like the Cypher character in the first Matrix movie.  When she declines, he decides not to take no for an answer.  He then decides if she's not leaving with him then shes not leaving the program alive.  Cool story and great fight scenes (5 stars).     <br />5. World Record- A man entering a race in the Olympics races to beat the world record.  But as he races on he wakes up in and out of the Matrix and the real world.  The Agents around him do there best to keep him in the real world, going so far as to destroying all the muscles in his legs making him unable to walk again.  Great animation and a pretty neat premise (5 stars).     <br />6. Beyond- A girl looking for her cat in her neighborhood finds an abandoned house which gives her and some neighborhood children special powers (floating, breaking and repairing a glass bottle, seeing rain fall were there are no clouds).  The premise of the story is that the house is basicly a glich in the Matrix and soon Agents come to fix this glich.  It was ok and the animation was pretty good too but there was something about this film that I just didn't like, I don't know why, maybe it was just to cutesie for me (I'd say between 3 and 3 1/2 stars)     <br />7. A Detective Story-  The Agents are having trouble finding a hacker named Trinity, so they hire the services of a local P.I.  So far three Investigators have tried looking for her.  One killed himself, one went insane and the other vanished into thin air.  It's gotta 1940's feel to it (like a Humphrey Bogart movie) and it's all in black and white (some color).  It's like a 40's period piece but the charcters use todays technology.  I liked the script and the black and white went well with the feeling of the film.  Also great animation and I love 1940's period type films (5 stars).     <br />And finally 8. Matriculated- Some people in the real world take down and capture a machine sent to hunt and destroy.  They then take the machine and download it and them selves into an alternite reality (kind of like a Matrix for Machines) to try and convince it to join them in their fight.  The animation has a weird feeling to it in the alternate wolrd sequence and it is a littlecreepy and I still don't really get the ending (I had to watch it a few times before I understood most of it, I think the machine falls in love with one of the girls) but I did like the tribute to Warner Bros. cartoons (you'll know it when you see it).  It was well made and had great looking machines (3 to 3 1/2 stars).     <br />There are only commentaries for four of the films, The Second Renaissance I and II, Program and World Record.  There's a feature called \\"From Scrolls to Screen\\", it's basicaly about the history of anime.  The Creators feature are Bios about the creators of the films (directors, script writers, etc.) and the Execution feature gives you a film about the individual director and script writer of the movie they made.  They also give you a glimps of the \\"Enter the Matrix\\" video game.  You can also put this in your dvd-rom for more features.  <br />So if you enjoy Anime and The Matrix then I suggest you buy this DVD.  If you don't like Anime, you just might after you see these films (DVD- 5 STARS).
0553573403|5.0|Not often these days does one find a series that jumps out in living, breathing characterization.  The players in this epic are believable, the dialog staggering in its realism.  Martin has grasped the concept of point and counterpoint between characters so well that I was convinced right away.  Martin seems to have actually LIVED these dozens of lives himself.  A must read for fantasy fans.
B000002WPI|4.0|This CD definitely deserves to be called a masterpiece. It is far better than any of the BS being dished out by poor excuses for rappers nowadays (ahem...DMX). Every track is listenable, and only two are not great. 36 Chambers contains so many new ideas that have never been seen before in the hip hop world, such as the martial arts themes, which go perfectly with the adrenaline-rushing, chest-thumping hardcore tracks and the fast and frequent mic exchanges. All in all, I categorize this as a classic. I didn't give it 5 stars because I can't give it the same score as Snoop's Doggystyle, which is much better than even this excellent album.<br />This CD, along with other classics like Dr. Dre's The Chronic and Snoop's Doggystyle, is a must have for any regular and even non-regular rap listener,
B00007JMCX|2.0|First off, let me say that I am a huge Bowie fan, owning and loving all of his original albums. But I simply did not enjoy this movie. Not at all really.<br />  The story itself is neat, but it takes, well, a paragraph to describe (which I'll let you read in other reviews), and then you've got it. There's nothing more to it, there are no plot twists, nothing amazing or new. The movie moves so slow, it seems to go on for hours, and it's never exciting, just boring.<br />  The acting from all performers in the movie is just fine, but the way the movie was put together is pretty bad. The script is barely there at all, the cinematography is dull and unoriginal, the alien design seems much older than it is, and doesn't impress. There's also a lot of sex in this movie, which I have no objections to, but it's put together in such odd ways, and never really makes sense that it's in there.<br />  To put it simply, I guarantee you that if this movie didn't have David Bowie it wouldn't be remembered at all. The only thing neat about this movie is that I saw where the cover for \\"Station to Station\\" and \\"Low\\" came from. Sadly, you're really not missing anything, but if you're a huge fan like me, you'll have to see it for yourself.
B000002MFN|5.0|This isn't her best album but it deserves to be listened because it's really great. It's danceable (Fever, Deeper and Deeper), funny (Bye Bye Baby, Theif of hearts), sexy (Erotica, Go Down) and deep (Why's it so hard, In this life) and \\"Bad Girl\\" is probably one of Madonna's most underestimated singles. Buy it, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00005YU1O|1.0|I heard such fantastic things, but I couldn't even finish it.  I felt like I was sitting and listening to one of those guys you knew in college who talked and talked about postmodernism and existentialism, but never actually SAID anything.      Further, reviewers keep writing \\"Not for everyone\\" or \\"Not everyone will understand.\\"  I get it, just like I can \\"understand\\" the movie Gigli, but that doesn't mean it's smart or sophisticated, or worth watching or that it even has a point!    Do not waste two precious hours of your life on this!
B000002LGQ|5.0|This is the album that every singer would love to record, it was released in 1989 and after 14 years, it still sounds fresh and innovative. I basically grew up listening to this album and I still think that it's one of the best albums ever made in history. There are crazy songs you can dance to like Express Yourself, songs you can cry to like Promise To Try and masterpieces like Till Death Do Us Apart and Oh Father. When I'm in a bad mood, listening to this album always makes me feel better.... Madonna at her best.
B00005JLRT|1.0|My God, how I weep for this generation's appalling propensity to accept any third-rate studio-spewed filth with &quot;kewl&quot; cgi explosions as legitimate, worthwhile products of the cinema. The only challenging element of 'Nemesis' is the challenge to decide which component of the &quot;creative&quot; process produced the worst contribution to the whole. The script was a convoluted, amateurish mess, producing (admittedly derivative) tripe that was not so much an homage to Trek's history, as it was hard evidence of how far the franchise has fallen.<br />Stuart Baird, a legendary film editor, shows us all why you should stick to what you're good at. His puzzling overuse of EXTREME closeups makes one wonder if he was playing with a new camera and didn't realize that it was &quot;on&quot;, and the &quot;empathic trance&quot; scene with Troi was so poorly lit and photographed, it looked like an OUTTAKE from an Ed Wood film (&quot;Nah, I'd be embarrased to have people see that!&quot;). Of the ten Trek &quot;films&quot;, only three (The Motion Picture, II, and VI) were made by actual FILM DIRECTORS, and it shows.<br />Save your money, and buy copies of the director's editions of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, or Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (the only two legitimate &quot;films&quot; of the ten entries in this <BR>woefully underachieving franchise). If you already have copies of TMP and TWOK, buy more and ship them to the people who think that Nemesis somehow qualifies as good cinema, or even DECENT Star Trek. <br />If anyone wonders if this film franchise is dead, consider this: it began with Gene Roddenberry and Robert Wise in charge. 'Nemesis' gave us Rick Berman and Stuart Baird. <br />Nuff said.
B000002NJS|4.0|With &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, Madonna tried to please all the people who act intellectual, that is the reason why this album has been so succesful, because since this kind of music sounds &quot;oh so mature&quot;, people felt intellectual if they liked it. That's why I give it 4 stars and not 5. Don't misunderstand me, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is a great album but for some reasons, I don't believe that Madonna was completely sincere when she made it. It still remains a very good album with great lyrics and amazing music so if you don't have it, buy it.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Britney Spears is oh so over hyped.  Her musical vision for the most part is oh so limited to 10-15 year olds.<br />There are a few creative twists here and there with Britney rapping with her friends.  The beat is pretty cool but certainly gets stale after a while.  And the lyrics are oh so juvenile.  I like the opening track and a few other songs are decent.  However, the artifical unoriginal musical arrangment makes the impression tolerable at best.
B000000W5N|5.0|Wow!  Does it get any better than this?  One great performance after another (well, okay, &quot;Sway&quot; isn't great).  Here we have the Rolling Stones at their peak.  What more needs to be said?
B00005YW4H|5.0|I've listened to this over and over again....and I'm still not tired of it!  I purchased it based on Come Away With Me and the rest of the CD is just as good!  A definate must have!!!!
0790729725|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  I have seen it, literally, about 10 times in the last 9 months.  The scenes in this movie are very vivid; they stick with you.  It's hard to forget the climactic scenes that show the day Henry Hill is caught selling drugs, for instance.<br />This movie has been accused by some of glorifying the Mafia life. I think the opposite is the case. Although in the beginning of the movie clearly it looks good to be a gangster, that all changes when Hill is caught with drugs and has his life threatened by his best friends.<br />I'm having trouble getting across how wonderful I think this movie is.  Let me sum up by saying that if you are interested in the Mafia at all, especially in seeing how a blue collar Mob guy lived, you should check out GoodFellas.
B00006JJ1O|1.0|The lyrics speak for themselves. All these girls do is scream the same line over and over and OVER again until it is relentlessly ANNOYING.<br />Here are some of the lyrics to &quot;Not Gonna Get Us.&quot; The lyrics alone prove a valid point to NOT buying this terrible CD.<br />Not gonna get us<BR>They're not gonna get us<BR>Not gonna get us<BR>Not gonna get us<br />They're not gonna get us<BR>They're not gonna get us<BR>Not gonna get us<BR>They're not gonna get us<BR>Not gonna get us<br />Nothing can stop this, not now I love you<BR>They're not gonna get us<BR>They're not gonna get us<BR>Nothing can stop this, not now I love you<BR>They're not gonna get us<BR>They're not gonna get us<BR>They're not gonna get us<BR>They're not gonna get us<BR>They're not gonna get us<br />Not gonna get us<BR>Not gonna get us<BR>Not gonna get us<BR>Not gonna get us<BR>Get us <BR>Not gonna get us
B00008LDPU|3.0|The Animatrix is a collection of nine animations commissioned and produced by the Matrix writer-directors Larry and Andy Wachowski. The animations vary from fairly simple &quot;A Detective Story&quot; to state-of-the-art &quot;The Last Flight of the Osiris. <br />I found the collection of animations to be quite interesting -- both from an artistic point of view and from a storyline point of view. Even though &quot;A Detective Story&quot; is the least sophisticated piece technique-wise, I found the story the most enjoyable. The realism of &quot;The Last Flight&quot; was just incredible. &quot;The Second Renaissance&quot; and &quot;Kids Story&quot; give a lot of background to the Matrix storyline. <br />This DVD is great for fans of &quot;The Matrix&quot; looking for additional background as well as people who like animation. Those like me (who found &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; a bit long in the tooth) will most likely find the DVD just OK. If you haven't seen &quot;The Matrix&quot;, then skip this DVD.  <br />There isn't much in the way of DVD extras - only some director's commentary for a few of the animations. The one I watched had English subtitles. Interesting, if you have the time to watch but it didn't do much for me. <br />Recommend: Yes to Matrix/Animation fans<BR>Watch again: Probably not
B00008OWZC|5.0|I once posted a review discouraging everyone (even my worst enemy) from purchasing the SONG REMAINS THE SAME Sountrack.  In addition I cried out my desire for a GOOD live album to do a band as amazing as Led Zeppelin justice.  My prayers have been answered and so have millions of fans around the world.  We are FINALLY blessed with a spectacular live album!  This should definitely be brought down in history as one of the best live rock albums.  Rivaling \\"Live After Death,\\" \\"KISS ALIVE,\\" \\"AC/DC LIVE,\\" or any other classic live albums you could possibly think of. <BR>The quality is relatively good and the song choices are even better.  So PLEASE get this and not \\"Song Remains the Same,\\" you'll know where the money went!  I recommend this to new or veteran Zeppelin fans alike.  The best album of any sort released in the past few years!  EVERY Member is in top form, especially Jimmy though.  He plays chords more brilliantly than I've ever heard them.  I now have so much faith in their live ability (although we might never witness it again).  JUST GET THIS ALBUM!!!<BR>Oh, and who's with me on pounding the snot out of the reviewer that compared this album to Duran Duran's Live Album?!
B00005QGAT|5.0|Well, I wore the tape out twice through playing it so much. I then decided to use my common sense and buy the CD. <br />You spoil us Mr. Jackson. The world does not deserve such a great artist as yourself. Man, every song on this album is fantastic. EVERY TIME that I listen to Off the Wall I hear new things and this is 21 years since i first owned it. I was 5 when I first heard it. FIVE! And it rocked then. Most of the recordings I listened to when I was five I've ditched, but this one has stayed with me. This is like my nursery rhymes, man. This is my musical education. You turned a FIVE year old on to the funk. THANK YOU!
0790729652|5.0|The first time I saw Batman I was 5 years old.I fell in love with the movie,after that I became a huge Batman fan.Then I started buying the toys,seeing all the cartoons and movies,also reading his comic books.Tim Burton does a great job in capturing the darkness of Batman unlike joel schumacher did in Batman forever,especially in batman and Robin.Michael Keaton does his best performance of his life as batman and bruce Wayne,jack nicholson does a great performance as joker in this movie.I give it a 5/5 rate.buy it you won't regret it at all.
B000002U8G|4.0|Let me be the first to say that Meddle is indeed a classic and must have for Floyd fans. Let me also be the first to say that it is in my opinion by far not their best. It does contain some filler which is rare for the Floyd (except for perhaps The Wall), but it also contains some of Dave, Roger, Rick, and Nicks best work to date. Here is my personal feelings about each song and their rating:<BR>    <BR>One of these Days: Classic Instrumental with that ever so scary phrase by Nick Mason. This is by far Pink Floyd's most action packed work of art. 5/5<br />A Pillow of Winds: Definitely not my favorite, but far from bad. Sometimes I like this song and sometimes I don't. 3/5<BR>    <BR>Fearless: Aside from Echoes, best song on the album. I especially like the crowd singing &quot;I will carry You&quot; 5/5<BR>    <BR>San Tropez: Roger's contribution to the album definitely feels out of place and isn't very memorable, but it can be fun nonetheless. 3.5/5<BR>    <BR>Seamus: Classic definiton of Filler. Really has no place on this album and isn't very enjoyable listening. Definitely a skip over. 1/5<BR>    <BR>Echoes: The absolute best song by Pink Floyd. Fantastic listening and mesmerizing lyrics. It is too short even at 23 minutes. The reason to buy this album. 6/5<br />To make a long story short. Meddle is a flawed but nevertheless great album.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Apparently, musicals are back in style these days. Last year's, Moulin Rouge hinted the return of the genre in Hollywood. This year, it is back in full form with much flair in Rob Marshall's Chicago. <BR>   Musical used to be a staple of Hollywood during its golden age. At its peak , it produced such unforgettable classics such as  My Fair Lady, Mary Poppins, and the Sound of Music. However, in the late sixties the genre started to lose its steam and since then it was slowly phased out from the silver screen. Those in the film industry attributed the  main cause of its demise to the audience's change of taste. The audience had simply grown tired of the form. Others cited problems with the budget which tended to snowball in most movie adaptations of a stage production. Whatever its reason , it seemed true that musical was finally dead. However, after decades of hiatus, people are once again ready to embrace the genre, and for the most part, Chicago does not disappoint us.<BR>  The film revolves around two murderesses, a somewhat famous chorus singer named Velma Kelly(played by Catherine Zeta-jone) and a nonentity called Roxie Hart(played by Renee Zellweger) who aspires to perform on stage just like Velma. Coincidentally, fate has it that both of them end up in jail for murdering their lovers who had done them wrong. At first there's no doubt that they are on a sure-fire track to the gallows. But then a publicity-seeking hot shot lawyer by the name of William Flynn (played by Richard Gere) takes an interest in their case. At first, Velma receives much of the attention since she already had a semi-celebrity status. However Flynn starts to discover Roxie's talent in dazzling the public. As the story progresses, the two vixens vie against one another to hog the attention of their lawyer and more importantly , the spotlight from the public. Soon the crimes they committed  start to become less important than what they are wearing for their trial.<BR>      The movie brims with mordant criticism of how the American trial system can be susceptible to the influence of the media. Such critiques aren't exactly covering new territory. During the past decade, we saw a surge of such criticism in the wake of the O.J. Simpson's case, Lorena Bobbitt's case, Tanya Harding's case and numerous others. There have been movies made about it too. In Gus Van Sant's To Die For, Nicole Kidman played a similar type of publicity-addict. In Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, a pair of mass murderers were given the spotlight.<BR>The movie Chicago is based on a famous Broadway play during the 70's which is in turn based on a novel. The novel itself is said to draw as its source from a real life event in the 20's with a story similar to Roxie and Velma's. As one can see, the bond between  crimes and the media goes back a long time.<BR>     So how does the movie fare? As I said before it does not disappoint us. The two leads , Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones throw themselves out there with a palpable conviction. There's no question that these two stars invested a lot of time in getting their dance routines right. Equally impressive is the supporting ensemble cast, including Ricahrd Gere as the smarmy lawyer, Queen Latifah as the 'matron Momma', John C. Reilly as the cuckold husband, and Christine Baranski as the sycophantic reporter. If my count is correct, there are about ten musical numbers, nine of which that takes place in Roxie's imagination. Credits should be given to the script writers for coming up with such a clever story device. As for the singing, however, my feelings are divided. Some of them are excellent. Queen Latifah is naturally good (she's better known for her music career after all), John C. Reilly delivers a surprisingly luscious voice, and as for Catherine Zeta-Jones, to hear her belt out the opening tune 'All that jazz', should alone be worth the admission price of 7000 wons. But Renee Zellweger's singing leaves much to be desired. Although it isn't exactly bad, it's not all that impressive either. She suffers from the same problem Nicole Kidman faced in Moulin Rouge. She simply doesn't have a strong enough voice. However compared to Richard Gere's singing, hers is Pavarotti. I expect the audience to cringe as I did when he gets his voice running. Some people should just not be allowed to sing.<BR>      At the moment, Chicago is the front runner in the Oscar race with thirteen nominations including Best Picture. I expect the film to win the coveted Best Picture Oscar, not because I believe the film is a masterpiece, but because the competition is so weak. Although I do not feel the picture deserves a space on the mantelpiece alongside the likes of The God Father or Schindler's List, I do admit to having enjoyed two hours of good entertainment. 5,6,7,8..hit it! \\"All that jaaazzzz!\\"
