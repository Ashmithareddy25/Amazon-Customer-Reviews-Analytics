B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I hate writing reviews but felt Evermore was deserving. I love that I can use it on my iphone, my Kindle Fire, and my laptop and it's all synched. It's increased my productivity and creativity. Know matter where I go, Evermore is always one memory maker, list taker away.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|just what a i need , very good app. works fine .....way to go amazon for this application. no problems so far.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing I dont understand why people rate low then they say perfect game or something like that
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|I read the other reviews and decided to try it, I loved the way the white color looked, but less than two weeks using is just inside home, I find that the base is veryunstable, and its already very scratched just for having it lyin around. The thin that annoys me the most, is that its begginning to peel in the edges, as if the plastic was of very poor quality.  I include some pictures so you can see the strange peeling I´ve been experiencing, for that price, I wouldn´t reccomend it at all!  [...]  [...]  [...]  [...]  [...]
B0036CYKQE|5.0|Having never seen the series on television and at this point not caring what the network did or didn't do -- This was a great season end episode.  Get your hankies out, and go through a little romance, a lot of excitement, have your heartstrings tugged and get some issues that weren't clarified wrapped up.  This is well written, well acted and is well worth the cost of purchase.  It is intriguing enough that I will be watching it again (several times) just to discover any of the fine points I missed in the first viewing.  This is the writer's work at his best.  And then I'll be sharing it with several girlfriends for chick flick night and crying over certain scenes again.  I do have to add that it was also appreciated by my husband and my 20-something son so it is not strictly a woman's film.  I won't spoil the ending for you but definitely do watch this!
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I have been searching for a Calendar app for my Kindle Fire to sync my Google calendars and finally found it. CalenGoo is very easy to setup, syncs all of your google calendars and not just the default calendar like most. My only complaint at this time is the font in the monthly view seems a little out of focused and can be hard to read at times but a workaround is going to the weekly view. Hopefully they will come out with HD version soon. I am satisfied and would recommend.
B000RHFZ9C|5.0|I was a little worried buying a used LP that didn't have too much of a description, but I took a chance since my son really wanted a Sgt Pepper's record for Christmas.  I was very pleased with the speed of the delivery and the quality of the record.  The seller described it as being in \\"excellent condition\\" and it was.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|Not a bad looking app at all but it lacks a few features as well as some date bugs. As other people have mentioned a major missing feature would be sub groups or categories. In the calendar reminder Jan has 32 days and Feb this year is leap year so we should have 29 days but it only goes up to the 28th. In the 30 minutes using the app I feel that for free it can be used as an acceptable quick task reminder. At the advertised $4.99 price I would say that it falls below the justification.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Works well. Good GUI. Notes: must use in portrait mode because certain options in pop-ups are not visible in landscape. Also, why does January have 32 days?
B0067R0APK|4.0|Gives pretty accurate weather forecasts in a non cluttered easy to use window. I love the daily forecasts with precipitation levels monitored by day and night. I say you cannot go wrong here.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it has been super useful at work for organizing  notes and tasks.  it works well on my kindle fire.  I really like the search feature.
0141192410|5.0|Every year I give my eleven year old daughter a book for Christmas so this year I bought \\"Little Women\\" and I was very pleased with the book.  I love the cloth cover and graphics. It was a great value for what I paid for it. It looks great on the bookshelf and of course who doesn't love \\"Little Women\\", a great classic!!  My daughter also received a Kindle Fire for Christmas which she loves but I still love to see children with a book in their hands.
B005UKJX4E|3.0|My main issue is that I did love Malick's Thin Red Line, but now I doubt I'll ever be able to appreciate it fully again, as after seeing the Tree of Life the very similar rambling metaphysics, obsession with the struggle in nature, unusual camera angles and abrupt transitions just feel like a gimmick.  For me these techniques and themes worked very well against the sharp contrast of a war story, but ... now in the Tree of Life, they feel like a hangover.  Too self indulgent for a mainstream movie.  Would work streamed constantly in an art house with ample beer, or as a strong first attempt by a young unknown director.  Says something sad about Hollywood that it takes a mature director to gather the power to make bold failures like this.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|You can watch Marines whispering when no whispering is needed (a standard device Hollywood uses to pluck the heartstrings of gullible viewers).  You can watch Marines get in touch with their feelings and love each other when they should be fighting the enemy.  You can watch them shouting and losing control when they should be concentrating their efforts on an alien invasion.  Semper Fi sweetheart.
B000GFLKF8|3.0|The storyline of \\"Inside Man\\" could have been much better told by someone other than Spike Lee.  Lee, a professional race-baiter with no discernible talent, manages to destroy what might have been a good heist flick if not ruined with his signature stupidities.    Ron Howard was originally set to direct this film, but pulled out to do \\"Cinderella Man\\".  The movie suffers as a result of the decision to allow Lee to work his social justice \\"magic\\" on the production.      Maybe, one day, the movie industry will wake up to the fact that allowing Spike Lee access to big budget film directing is a sure recipe for ruination of a project.  Lee could go back to doing his silly little indie projects which show his view of the world.    Lee's signature stupidities in this film include the shot of a character on rails speeding toward the camera with a deadpan expression, and the depiction of a drunkard clutching a 40 with fins on the cap to make it look like a bomb.  Lee seems to think that these elements are essential to any film he directs.    \\"Inside Man\\" misses by a mile, mainly due to the director.
1451627289|5.0|Another of King's enchanting stories.  King has a real talent for characterization and placing one in a particular time period.  Baby boomers will appreciate this tale.  I'll bet you still remember what you were doing on November 22, 1963.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this game much better than regular solitaire. easy to play but still challenging. could do without the ads though.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I was so excited to find all 8 Harry Potter movies for just $40! True, they don't have any bonus features, but I don't really watch those anyway. I think that if you don't care about having all the extras, this set is great and it's a great price!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is entertaining for awhile. But sometimes you need a break from it, and start playing again the next day. Not addictive like many games.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|loved the game it was awsome but a limitless hard on some of the game some are trickyer than others but over it was a good game :)

0307891372|5.0|I'm one of those guys who are iffy about purchasing strategy guides because I usually end up finding everything and anything I want, and most times the strategy guides aren't thorough or well designed. So I did some research to find out the best guide possible. Lo and behold I stumble upon this book, it is so much more and beyond I expected, it is definitely worth every penny.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|My nephew LOVED this watch.  He informed me that today was his first day back to school with his new watch.  He has been taking it apart and changing the pieces out.  Perfect gift for a little boy!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I'm still getting used to my new gtablet but the Spider Solitaire app was easy to download and play. This is my favorite card game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Though some find it hard or tediouse due to not always being able to win but that just makes it a challenge to both your mind and patience. To thoughs who understand, a challenge is fun.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|Great game (I love majong) but keeps freezing &amp; shutting down on my Droid X. Glad I got this on the free offer day or I'd be cursing the purchase!
0062082353|5.0|Great autobiography about a truly inspirational man, soldier, husband and friend.  Great insight to both his life as a solider but also as everyday American.
B004EPZ084|5.0|THis was entertaining and funny.  The antagonists are such perfect jerks, really top notch cast.  Jennifer Anniston has never looked hotter which helps too.  Recommend.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|sometimes it will be slow loading and sometimes when it's done loading when I try to pull back on the sling shot it zooms in and out. but I think it's a fun game if its not doing any of that
B0054JZC6E|3.0|there are directions before the game but you have to press the &quot;?&quot; button to retrieve them. also I agree the controls for some of the games need work!!!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Very addictive game! The levels are nice and updates keep the game fresh! It its def worth the money so give it a try.
0307959856|1.0|As a fervent fan of both Jane Austin and P.D. James, I waited for the book with impatience and promised myself a few delightful afternoons in the company of my favorite ladies.  But, alas, the disappointment was huge. I had to struggle and force myself to finish the much expected book! I'm sorry to say that the plot is weak, the style is artificial, the characters are flat and the author's use of other Jane Austin characters in order to explain her heroes' actions is cumbersome and even pathetic.  Such a superb writer like P.D.James should know that Jane Austin is unique and each attempt to imitate her is doomed to failure.  I'm waiting now for another book of the \\"mistery queen\\" to make me forget  this one. Meanwhile , I'll go back to Pemberley in company of Jane Austin .
B0063IH60K|5.0|A fun easy implementation of the old Klondike solitaire. l've had a great time playing this. l recommend it for those moments when you need some 'mindless entertainment.'
B000002P5W|5.0|Many bands often suffer from the dreaded \\"sophomore slump\\" when producing their 2nd album, especially when that album follows a highly successful and critically acclaimed debut.  Fortunately for the Jimi Hendrix Experience, that was not the case on the band's 2nd album Axis: Bold As Love.  Not only was it \\"not the case\\" but on the contrary, it was anything but, as Axis turned out to be one of the greatest follow-up albums of all-time.   This feat is all the more impressive considering the fact that it followed what many people consider to be the greatest debut album in the history of rock music: Are You Experienced.  For a band to capture lightning in a bottle twice is incredibly impressive, but then again, this was no ordinary band.  This was The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and Axis: Bold as Love finds the group picking up right where they left off from their debut album, producing a fresh set of songs just as catchy and groundbreaking as those found on their debut.  That said, Axis generally feels slightly less ambitious than Are You Experienced, basically sounding like a more concise version of that album.  It could be said that Axis is simply Are You Experienced \\"Part II\\" although that would probably be oversimplifying the record too much.  Although the albums sound fairly similar (probably because they were both released in the same year), Axis finds the band stretching out somewhat and continuing the experimental nature that made their debut such a fresh and exhilarating listen.  The album opens with a brief skit about aliens before transitioning into the incredibly cool and jazzy \\"Up From the Skies\\".  This song is one of the most underrated Hendrix songs out there, probably because it's so chill and mellow.  It may sound somewhat underwhelming compared to some of the band's other material, but this song is \\"cool\\" personified.  After that subdued opener, the band kicks the door off the hinges with the explosive \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\", which is quite simply one ofthe most hard-rocking songs in the band's catalog.  Simply put, it kicks ass.  Nuff said.  The following track is another under-the-radar Hendrix classic \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\".  This song is easy to listen to, melodic, has a great beat, and is catchy as hell.  It's sweet and smooth as silk, and one of my personal favorite songs from the band.  After that, the band kicks up the tempo again with the next track, \\"Ain't No Telling\\".  It's a short song, clocking in at under 2 minutes, but it's quite possibly one of the best under 2 minute songs you'll ever hear, as Hendrix and the band jam away at a delightfully dizzying pace.  It's a tight song and everything flows along perfectly, with each member of the band clicking on all cylinders.  Very cool song.  The following track is not only the best song on the album, but also one of the best songs of all-time.  \\"Little Wing\\" is short and sweet, clocking in at just over 2 minutes, but its melody is sublime.  It's an incredibly beautiful song, inspiring the likes of Stevie Ray Vaughan and many others to cover it in future decades.  One of the sweetest songs ever made, and a great example of Hendrix's unique and endearing spirit.  The band follows up that classic with yet another classic, albeit with a much different vibe.  \\"If 6 Was 9\\" finds the band delving into more psychedelic territory, and as opposed to the sensitive and sweet Hendrix found on \\"Little Wing\\" here we find him in a much more fatalistic and rebellious mood.  His lyrical commentary is sarcastic and biting \\"white collar conservative walking down the street, pointing his plastic finger at me...\\" as well as fatalistic with this now haunting line \\"I'm the one that's got to die when it's time for me to die, so let me live my life, the way I want to...play-on Jimi\\"...  And play-on he does, closing out the song with some wickedly surreal and otherworldly psychedelic guitar-playing awesomeness.  Fantastic.  The band then switches gears with the next track \\"You Got Me Floating\\", which sports a more up-tempo, borderline danceable sound.  The song has a great rhythm and a fun vibe, sounding a little refreshing after the somewhat intense nature of \\"If 6 Was 9\\".  Another outstanding track.  Yet another classic song soon follows with \\"Castles Made of Sand\\".  Similar in sound and vibe to \\"Little Wing\\" it too is an incredibly beautiful and melodic piece, proving that Hendrix was just as good when he was writing sensitive ballads as he was when playing mindblowingly awesome guitar.  For this reviewer, he was at his best focusing on the melody, and songs like \\"Castles Made of Sand\\" are a perfect example of that.  Hendrix actually takes a break from the microphone on the next track \\"She's So Fine\\" as Noel Redding steps in to deliver the vocals.  He does a great job on the mic, and the band delivers the goods as well, giving the song a very light and breezy feel.  Another great melodic track.  The band continues to explore their melodic tendencies on the next track \\"One Rainy Wish\\".  This song almost sounds like a classic 60s soul song.  Really beautiful, really melodic, and very sweet.  Again, yet another example of how good Hendrix was at crafting beautiful and sensitive melodies, something that largely gets overlooked because of his guitar virtuosity.  Speaking of, the next track \\"Little Miss Lover\\" sees Hendrix rocking out in the vein of \\"Foxey Lady\\".  It's a good song, no doubt, but it's not quite as good as \\"Foxey Lady\\" sounding more like a rehash of that song than something new and fresh.  That said, it still has a great swagger, a distinctive Hendrix swagger.  Lastly, the album closes out with the title track, which is similar in sound to the soulful \\"One Rainy Wish\\".  \\"Axis: Bold As Love\\" sports a more passionate vibe however, and the song closes out with one of the most mindblowing Hendrix solos of all-time, literally sounding like he and the band are blasting off into outer space.  A fitting way to end and album that loosely has that \\"outer space\\" theme going on.  So overall, as a whole, Axis: Bold As Love is a stellar follow-up to Are You Experienced.  Because Axis is sandwiched between the aforementioned debut and the infamously mindblowing Electric Ladyland that followed it, the album unfortunately seems to get lost in the shuffle when discussing some of the best albums of the 60s.  Axis: Bold As Love is probably Hendrix's most accessible album, and while it may sound slightly underwhelming compared the album that proceeded it and the one that followed (both for very different reasons) it certainly stands on its own as not only a great album, but one of the greatest albums of the entire decade to boot.
0547258305|5.0|I really enjoyed this story. The characters are fabulous - Katsa & Po pull at your heartstrings. I loved the way the plot developed - never in a straight line and never quite what you expected. Great writing!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've got close to a dozen sharpeners including an electric model that costs over $100 and this one is the best value for the money. I keep several of these around; they are compact and effective.  Yes, I have some that are better, but they cost 3X the price.  I also have some that cost more and don't work near as well.
068484267X|4.0|Och.  It's a word you see alot of in this book.  Also the repetition of a familiar theme:  Drunken father comes home in middle of the night after drinking his wages (or his dole money) at the pub and wakes his children up.  Forces them to stand or march in place as he offers them a penny to die for Ireland.  What precedes this madness is dysfunctional, codependent mom waiting hopefully, then less hopefully as time goes by, for said husband to come home with wages.  Och, och indeed.  In between this sad tale we have the McCourt children, in constant need of food, milk, coal, housing, and most of all, sane parenting.  The miracle of this book is that McCourt finds the humor, the blessed humor in what otherwise would be one of the most depressing tales since Dickens.  Their poverty is just plain awful to read about.  Three of the McCourt children die in infancy or a little beyond, because their parents do not get medical care in time.    It's a tale of survival, a lyrical jaunt through the madness of dysfunction, ignorance, and threadbare familial love.  You could see it as a tale of hope, if only you don't wonder what damage was done to these McCourt child survivors that can never be repaired.  If your childhood was tough, this book is for you.  However bad it was, this might make you feel like you did a lot better.  Cheers to McCourt for this bitter tale of woe with a pinch of hope thrown in.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finished reading this novek this morning and the brutality behind Collin's plot really creates likeable, believable characters and an understanding from the audience's perspective that is far beyong even some of the greatest fantasy novels! This is a must read for everyone, children and adults alike!
B004S2XNU0|5.0|After reading Game of Thrones I had high expectations for A Clash of Kings.  My lofty expectations were surpassed because this book was great.  It starts off slower than Game of Thrones but once the story gets rolling there was no turning back.  Every page is better than the next.  I look forward to the 3rd book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great app...I'm addicted! very smooth game play...easy to understand too...I love that you can exit the came and then come back to the same spot later
B004FOA84A|5.0|loved this short game. definately left me wanting MORE! I was always a fan of Myst games and this has that same gameplay. it was even a little creepy. perfection.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|saw someone complained about different permissions and the needcl for gos but apparently they aren't needed on the fire. are you guys even trying these apps before reviewing? I keep seeing ridiculous complaints.anyway this app is the best alarm clock ive ever had and I consider myself an alarm junkie! I only wanted to read reviews to see what's the difference between the paid and the free? I do notice a tiny ad but if that's all I will keep the free but I'm sure the paid is worth the dollar they ask for it. I also just got an update for it which surprised me because I keep seeing reviews that say. amazon does not update their apps but maybe its a developer thing. rambling loo great clock wish I could do more Color combos but im weird like that. fun to play with and likes that I can listen to whole songs while debating whether to hit snooze! good music to wake up to :) try it you'll love it I'm gonna see what else they have I need a good fun calendar too
B000AGTPUK|1.0|The condition of the DVD is terrible. When viewing it for the first time it skipped in several places.  It appears to be a very \\"used\\" DVD.
B00275EHJG|1.0|I agree with apparently the minority in saying that this movie is too dark, depressing and hopeless for too long and I wouldn't recommend it for children.  Spoiler alert:  It has a theme running through it that deals with abandonment, concentration camp like places and near incineration.    Does my 3 year old need to see this or do I?  We skipped past alot then just turned it off but our boy still acted out a little bit.    Was screaming a little after the movie.  And was shy the next day.  And we turned it off as soon as things started going badly.  I don't know what the moral of the story is but I don't think it has any correlation with reality.    Ending was short and felt unreal like a dream.  Overall not at all redeeming or rewarding.   And why get desensitized and/ or instill fear in your child?    Personally, I would rather spend time with my family doing something more worthwhile.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|Movie was cute, sad and had a point. I don't think most young children understand the true significance of the story.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|Love the game and music - very soothing - but am frustrated with the unexpected closings - has happened every time I played.  I have sent it to the \\"Cloud\\" in disgust!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is very good. there is nothing wrongs with it! but u have to have a certain amount of coins to get a different game!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I guess this is a good cd. The only thing I can tell you is that I bought it for my wife and she hasn't complained. Sorry, not the best review.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|i absolutly loved this book! i read the firat couple of shopaholic books but i think i enjoyed this one a bit more.  i found myself relting more to Emma a lotmore and puttting myself in he shoes. I will defintely suggest this book.  it's, like i want more books of this story line.
B003L77GH4|5.0|A really excellent series.  Twilight takes a back seat to The Vampire Diaries for me.  It has a lot of action and when a vampire is evil - they are evil.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is addictive.  It is a fairly simple game, but requires logic and a little luck.  Great for the family, especially on these cold winter nights.
1439156816|5.0|As this was a Christmas gift, I cannot really comment.  My daughter was thrilled to get the book and as we are both Stephen King fans, I'm sure she will find the book useful.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The set of HP blu-rays arrived as projected by the seller.  We are now ready for an HP marathon some weekend soon.  Thank you.
0143170104|5.0|I read &lt;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo> and immediately came and ordered &lt;The Girl Who Played With Fire> and &lt;The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest>. These are very good books. Too bad Steig died and cannot continue the series. It does come to a satisfactory end of the story though so while there could have been more it doesn't leave you hanging from a cliff FOREVER.
1419702238|5.0|This book was the first thing requested on my nephews Christmas list. He has the entire series. It  is very true to every day life as a young teen,trying  to find out what's  their place in the world. It lets them know they are not alone.I find him reading instead of playing video games. That is a great feeling.  Get this series you will be thankful you did.  As will the young person you love. Amazon makes shopping easy, extremely reliable, fast, and saves time for the fun times in life. My favorite way to shop.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I was a little hesitant to buy this at first, by all the reviews about broken bands and constant scratching or constant beeping, but i can tell you for sure that anyone who had a problem with this headset either doesnt understand how 2.4 ghz spectrum works or just lazily placed it anywhere, If you are having a problem with scratching or popping place the transmitter infront of wireless access points like laptops phones or your xbox, Also this headset came with all the wires i would need like a spdif wire and a usb power wire. for 139.99 on amazon i thought it was an amazing deal, and the quality for this is amazing, you can hear anything and everything, and you will notice audio details in games and movies that you wouldnt have before, you can also hear WHERE everything comes from, its simply awesome and amazing. Great Purchase.
B004W2UBYW|1.0|I started reading this and only got into about 60 pages and got bored. I will try again since I'm a huge Apple fan.
B006FLGBGA|4.0|I must say I was not a fan of the original planet of the apes so was reluctant to watch this one. I was pleasantly suprised. It had a good story line lots of action and very realistic. Enjoyed the movie.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|This is a decent app. But please fix your calendar in the due date. It shows January has 32nd day.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|I've grown increasingly impatient watching recent movies. Most of them just don't have what it takes to keep my eyes on the screen with the movie, instead of the screen on my computer or the book in my lap. \\"Inside Man\\", I am happy to say, kept my attention throughout its running time - and then for a while after as I picked the story apart.<br /><br />  From almost the outset, it feels heavily influenced by \\"The Usual Suspects\\".<br /><br />  All the performances are excellent, the direction - with one notable exception - is solid and the script relentlessly forward. The Jodie Foster character, however,is unbelievable. It feels like the original idea for the character was altered in the course of making the movie to serve as sort of a Greek chorus whenever Spike Lee ran into a problem telling the story.<br /><br />  The movie is heavily dependent on cinematic tricks, such as exaggerated split focus. (There's a name for the effect, which I can't remember.) Surprisingly it is clumsily used, especially in a scene with Denzel Washington.<br /><br />  The basic story is simple: we are introduced to the bad guy, played by Clive Owen, who promises us that he is going yo pull off the perfect bank robbery. Lee employs flashforwards and flashbacks and real time to tell the story.<br /><br />  It is a taut and suspenseful storytelling - a very satisfying movie viewing experience.<br /><br />  The problem, at least for me, is that afterward I recognized that the story is full of holes. To Spike Lee's credit, like a magician, he keeps things moving so fast you don't latch on to the gaps while watching the movie. But afterwards, the holes were apparent.<br /><br />  Overall, though, the after-experience doesn't detract from the fact that this is an excellent piece of movie making.<br /><br />Jerry

0316069353|4.0|For me this was an enjoyable read, but I'm biased as I really like the writing of Michael Connelly. Fast paced action with the usual twists and turns. I enjoyed reading the court room drama and like the way Connelly gets you to root for the defense and the various tactics the defense team uses to win.   I've read all previous Michael Connelly books and I feel this is well worth a read especially if you like the character Mickey Haller. I've dropped a star as it's not one of my favourite Connelly books (I'm a Harry Bosch fan).
B0000020C4|5.0|I tried to purchase this item two seperate times. Both times the order had been cancelled!! I know the music is AMAZING because I have the dvd. The sellers just weren't very good!! The item gets 5 stars, but Amazon gets 0! On one item I got an email telling me that the item had shipped, only to find out it was cancelled instead!!
B004EBT5CU|3.0|Great singer, great voice, but mediocre songs which sound the same, repetitive chord changes, repetitive ideas.  Needs to seek out some good songwriters and perform some good tunes.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|The ultimate gladiator experience. Great depiction of roman society and it's ruthless and blood thirsty nature. Excellent acting as well. I highly recommend this series for anyone that likes drama and great fight scenes, but if you don't like to see excessive amount of blood then it's not for you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|using free version on Kindle Fire.  Like the way cards move.  Interest that you can have it deal a winning hand. Don't. Takes the real feel out of it.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I am absolutely addicted to this game. Its an amazing game and the developers have a lot of talent. I got my kindle fire for Christmas and was so excited to get this game on it. It will not download on my kindle though. I was shocked. I checked my Internet connection thinking that was the problem but it was fine. I asked some of my friends if they were having any trouble with their kindles but they already had around 20 different games on it. I tried other games and they didn't work either.if anyone has an idea about what's wrong email me at jamanji9000@Yahoo.com

B0054JZC6E|4.0|some really fun games on here, however, there seems to bear lag on the drag and click games. other than that its quite addicting
B006MHWXMS|1.0|Agreed, this app needs to follow the U.S. date format of mm-dd-yyyy if the developers actually want users in this country to USE it.  Some may not care, but many will.  The \\"January 32nd\\" is just pretty much a ridiculous oversight that shows sloppiness on the developer's part.  The inability to have sub-tasks nested is also going to drive away more users, the type that need a To-Do list for much more than simple lists with one heading.  Syncing constantly while the app is open is yet another downfall -- needs to have the ability to not sync until the user tells it to do so.  As far as only working with a Google gmail account, there are conflicting reports about that... but seriously LOL, this IS the ANDROID market, and if Google isn't your thing, maybe you should get an iPhone. Google is the nucleus of Android, and the full benefits of integration of Google products is one of the great benefits and draws of getting an Android phone in the first place.  I won't start actually putting in my precious tasks and giving this app a shot at being my primary To-Do list unless these critical changes are made.  Therefore, it has to become yet another \\"download but don't install yet\\" app just hanging there in my Amazon apps list until/unless it becomes ready for prime time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy the game. it is rather simple, however sometimes that all a person needs! works great, some days that's just what I need! Thank you
B000YJ6736|3.0|This book should be under the horror category.  I'll be brief, the story is nice and short.  I read it a while ago and it think it was about five chapters and fairly quick to get thru.   The writing is beautiful, gruesome, harsh, and lovely...  I didnt particularly care for the political bits...british parties and such in the 1940's/50's/60's is not my strong suit or interest (sorry)  But this story, as all of Mr. McEwan's books (atleast the one's I've read anyhow) have this strange sort of trauma and it lingers with you long after the book has been put away.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Most of these games are actually very addictive :) The controls are easy and responsive, the ads aren't overly annoying and the rewards are satisfying enough to keep you playing way longer than you originally intended lol. Any fan of Angry Birds needs to give this app a try.
B005K2LNZ4|5.0|It truly is a shame it's been over 13 years without any new material from Hollis, since he made music of such an amazing quality. From what I have read, though, he has retired completely from music. The background of Talk Talk is enticing, especially in their later years following the recording of Spirit of Eden. Furthermore, Mark Hollis underwent such a magnificent metamorphosis from a pop-star into a dark and religious musician who made some heart-breaking and dreadfully beautiful music. It actually seems like less of a metamorphosis, and more of a sort of maturity that needed to happen, since it seems he was never quite satisfied with the earlier Talk Talk albums, stating on television that many of his fans have an inferior taste.   This is the only album I can enjoy anywhere near as much as Laughing Stock. Luckily, the style is much similar in terms of atmosphere, production and instrumentation, which can not be said for many other records. The use of silence is immaculate, and is only better yet demonstrated on the vinyl pressing. Mark's vocal style is just as developed, if not more, as it appears on Laughing Stock, with amazingly original melodies, lyrics, and dynamics. Apparently this album is 100% acoustic, making it feel even more personal, and dare I say, transcendental.    My favorite part of this album would have to be the use of the piano & the melodica, because even on Laughing Stock it has such a delicate use of these two, and on this record it feels as if it is an extension of that style. Reading over the lyrics, I am blown away by how few of words Mark uses on this record. He is doubtlessly one of my favorite vocalists for pulling off such style in the way he spaces out his words and melodies. Often there are moments on this album that are exceedingly instrumental, which demonstrates Hollis as more of a musician than just a singer.   As for the item itself, it is packaged much like the CD, all black and white and with the artwork printed very small. The record is very quiet, which is suitable for the material, and it has great pace & feeling. I have played it many times, and it has not diminished in quality at all.   Definitely get this pressing before it's too late, or becomes too expensive. This is one of the few perfect albums out there.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Thor is the essence of what makes Marvel the best superhero comic company. It deftly combines ancient mythology with modern comic hero mythology.The film has great cinematography and the wardrobe and sets blend with the CGI to make the world believable. The story is compelling and the acting WAY above what I expected. Of course Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Odin but I never saw Tom Hiddleston coming as a brilliantly manipulative Loki. The lead Chris Hemsworth fits the bill as action hero who catches us off guard with his humor. He also has a couple of heartfelt moments with Natalie Portman whose Jane Foster finds more depth in this one film than Padme did in 3 Star Wars flicks. You don't have to like comics to like Thor, a blockbuster that lives up to the billing.
B005K2Z2O2|3.0|I received a Kindle Touch for Christmas so I needed to order a new case.  This one stated that it would fit my Kindle and it was a style I liked so I ordered it.  When it came it looked far too big for the Kindle Touch.  I put Kindle in there and it floated around inside the pouch. I grabbed my other Kindle (second generation) and it fit perfectly.  This is more like a generic Kindle case.  So if you're looking for something more specific, which I was since I already have two Kindle cases for my other Kindle I could use, then this isn't for you.  I ended up returning it.<br /><br />Other then not being what I wanted, it seemed like it was made well and would do the job.  I wish it worked for my application needs.
0312641893|4.0|I love fairy tales.  Always have, always will.  And I love Cinderella (hello, my wedding theme this past June was Cinderella's carriage..although the carriage in this story was really a beat up orange car which doesn't exist in this world anymore.)  But anyways.  Even though this type of book wouldn't normally interest me, I knew I had to read it since it was based off one of my favorite princess stories.  I have to admit.  I had to look up was a cyborg was.  I had no idea!  This book is so out of what I am used to.  But it held my interest.  I loved looking for ways of how this story matched up to the Cinderella story that I grew up with.  We had the evil stepmother and the stepsisters, although only one was evil.  You had Cinder working an unglamorous job and pretty much slaving away for the step mother.  I'm not really sure who the fairy godmother would be.  Maybe the closest would be the android that was a close friend to Cinder.  There was the shoe that fell off (with the foot).  And of course you had the prince. But aside of that you have an evil Queen from another planet and a horrible disease plaguing Earth.    There was a major surprise at the end.  Well, at least I think it was supposed to be a surprise, but I figured it out right from the beginning.  But it leaves for a nice cliffhanger.  This book is the first in a quartet and I will definitely be picking up the next book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these games are short and simple, but they're fun to kill a few minutes. each one is different so you get to do a lot of different things
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I wasn't familiar with Michael Buble until I listened to some excerpts from this CD at Amazon.com.  I liked what I heard, so I ordered it.  This music is for the young and old alike.  My 87-year old mother liked it just as much as my 20-something nephew!  The music and singing style of Michael Buble really puts you in the right spirit for the Christmas holiday.  I highly recommend it!
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I love the colorful, new, interesting textures and rhythms to this new CD, Coldplay knocks it out of the park once again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have played several versions of classic solitaire. I like the features of this app. The tap feature is my favorite feature, though, as it takes away all the drag and drop frustrations that you usually experience with card games. Hours of fun for even a novice solitaire player.
B005GSVFAK|2.0|According to website of this product, a Blu Ray disc should be 3D with Spanish subtitles or dubbed into Spanish. I received 2 promotions amazon this film (with 5 disks each), but nowhere came the 3D movie dubbed or subtitled in Spanish. It was false advertising.
B001HN6922|1.0|Ok, so they kept the same characters, but the relationship between the original \\"Cars\\" (which I LOVE!!) and this one is, well, almost nonexistent! My 3-yr-old daughter (who also loves the original \\"Cars\\") and I TOTALLY LOST INTEREST within 5-10 minutes, and NOTHING brought us back, despite sitting in the same room with her father (who DID like - but not REALLY like - the movie!) throughout the rest of the movie (she went on to play with her Legos, Play-Doh, etc, rarely peeking at the screen)!!!! Yes, as one reviewer commented, it's VERY JAMES BOND-LIKE, so if you like that crap (I don't), then you may like this movie! But James Bond movies have a much more COMPLICATED PLOT than any kids movie, so......how's a kid supposed to be able to follow that - or CARE TO?? DUMB DUMB DUMB idea for this movie!! Definitely NOT a movie made for kids (unless they're so hooked on the characters from the original \\"Cars\\" movie that they're willing to sit dumbly and watch them zip around on the screen for an hour and a half)!!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|fun but mostly the same as the original. no fantastic new features added but the gameplay is still engaging and addictive.
B0061S073A|5.0|I love this app.  I'm so glad someone mentioned it.  I've had my kindle since it came out but had to hide it so my sons wouldn't ask to play it. even though I got it for my boys. well know I have no problem letting both play with it.  Thank you for making this app.  My favorite app.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|Don't really have any complaints about the BluRay and it's content, not a perfect saga, but really enjoy watching it....
B00555X8OA|5.0|Those who like behavioral economics books like \\"Nudge\\", \\"Black Swan\\" and \\"The Tipping Point\\" will love this book.  Any reader with an interest in the social sciences will be impressed with Kahneman's  very thorough and wide ranging academic references.  His concepts are rigorously supported.  But, more importantly for the broader audience, Kahneman's social science depth and range is nicely balanced with common sense and a natural style of writing to the layman.  The often-cited work on thinking 'biases' and people's misguided application of probability and statistics is a nice challenge to any thoughtful reader.  Furthermore, his down-to-earth way of explaining his thought-model is a pleasure to read.  His concept of \\"What you see is all there is\\" could have been taken from your mother's adage that first impressions are important.  Any reader will finish this book...and will have a range of useful insights on how we think and make decisions.  I loved it!
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I thought this would be a good way to play 2-player in the 6-7 feet of play space I have in front of my TV.  While it does allow two people to fit into a smaller space and get closer to the screen, I am finding that it severely affects the accuracy of the sensor.  Sometimes it will allow a decent experience in games that don't require as much accuracy (Dance Central, Kinect Adventures), but even then there will be times where the sensor just completely loses someone or the hand icon jumps all over the screen no matter how steady you hold your hand.  And forget using this for games which are much more dependent on accurately tracking your movements (Kinect Sports 1 & 2, Gunstringer, Child of Eden).  The Zoom completely ruins the experience for these games and makes them unplayable.  If you, like me, were looking to enjoy Kinect in a limited space, look elsewhere because this doesn't work.  I had more success with the plastic clip to put the sensor on the top of my TV - Adds about the equivalent of a foot of play space. [[ASIN:B004XV6ST4 Kinect TV Mount Clip]]
B00012QM8G|5.0|This was a great deal. To get a great price & free shipping almost made this a \\"free\\" DVD. The DVD was exactly as advertised & delivered within a week of ordering.
0446573019|5.0|Just finished possibly the best Baldacci book ever.  This new chracter of his had everything you could want.  From start to finish I would have to say that he has crafted a book that rivals the oliver stone series.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Free. Fast. Fun. One cannot really complain about a game such as Spider, which offers a clean and enjoyable app for no charge.
B00000064G|5.0|Was not supposed to arrive until the new year...came early and made in time for Christmas!! Amazing value better buying on line than in the mall.
0446560073|5.0|Excellent condition.  Great service. What I expected. Would use again and recommend to anyone.  Good shopping experience and would use again.
B0042KA58G|5.0|I missed part of Vampires Season 2 and was upset I couldn't tivo it. Thank God Amazon has an instant video on demand service. Season 2 is so much better than 1 because Caroline is a vampire and is much nicer. Damon is obviously more smitten by Elena, but he can't act on it because of Stefan. I especially like the addition of Katherine.  This is one of my favorite tv shows to watch. I like it better than the books honestly because Damon has some real possibilities with Elena on the show.
B004H4XLR4|5.0|We got this airplane for my almost 4 year old son for Christmas.  He's a big Cars 2 fan.  This present upstaged everything and provided hours of fun on Christmas.  My son really gets into the whole imagination/action game with this airplane.  Amazon had a great price, for a toy that has been played with over and over.  If your kid/grandkid loves Cars 2, they will appreciate this airplane.  My son loves that it shoots things, and you can open it up and drive the cars in just like Mater and Finn did.
B000654YRY|5.0|I bought \\"On The Night\\" having heard only a few samples. I hoped it wouldn't be an all-too-typical filmed concert - weird cinematography, indifferent sound quality, and no sense of the concert experience. I needn't have worried: this is a FABULOUS concert recording! The music, the audio quality, the cinematography, and the production values are superb. Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits were on the band's final tour, and the group was honed to perfection on every level. The musicians, song selection and ambiance combine to make a fantastic whole. Knopfler is shown at the very top of his superb best - by turns tasty, dynamic, driving, understated, but always with the audience totally captivated. Other musicians include Alan Clarke, Phil Palmer, Guy Fletcher, and pedal steel guitar wizard Paul Franklin. All give stellar performances, with Knopfler highlighting everyone's talents and at the same time leading hot and tight. Knopfler's guitar style had evolved from Alchemy (1984) with a \\"less is better than more\\" subtlety,  matured in both technique and musicality. The song selection is brilliant, alternating between hard-driving rock and introspective ballad. The closing number, \\"Going Home\\", brought tears to my eyes and held the audience breathless. My only criticism of this DVD is that it's too short. The concert tour's song selections could easily have made \\"On The Night\\" a full 2-DVD set. I recommend \\"On The Night\\" wholeheartedly: this is Dire Straits presented at their very best. You will not be disappointed.
0439023491|4.0|After I finished \\"The Hunger Games\\" in one sitting, I quickly realized that I would have to get the second and third book of the series. \\"Catching Fire\\" is the second book of \\"The Hunger Games\\" Trilogy. Like the first, the drama and the story line was engaging and I read this in one sitting as well. I ended up liking this one better than the first. I found myself better able to understand the characters and really identifying with the questions and concerns that Katniss faces as she find herself the unwitting leader of a rebellion that she didn't even plan.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has an incredible way of crafting a story. She builds suspense in all the right places and keeps the story line moving throughout. Again, I would caution that the descriptions of the battle scenes would have me give this a PG-13 rating.<br /><br />Kristi Burchfiel, author of applicable Bible studies and devotionals.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is a really fun game. I like that it has several games in one and that I don't have to go to several games to play what I want.
0439023521|4.0|I received this book as a Christmas present. I had never even heard of the book, but noticed that there is a movie coming out this year. I started reading it that evening before bed and told myself that I'd stop at the first good stopping place. Six hours later I finally found the last page of the book and decided that was the best stopping point I could find.   This book was intriguing. I can see why this was picked up as a movie. The story line is engaging and moves quickly. There is a lot of drama and action. Katniss is a 16 year old who grows up in a world where children are forced to participate in a fight-to-the-death \\"game\\" that occurs every year. When her younger sister's name is pulled as a participant this year, Katniss volunteers to take her place. I was drawn to her character. Author Suzanne Collins has crafted an intriguing story that moves quickly and keeps people wondering how this story will turn out. One word of caution, the depictions of the battle scenes are descriptive, so I would certainly think a PG-13 rating would apply to this book.   Kristi Burchfiel, author of applicable Bible studies and devotionals.
B003O86FMW|2.0|I really did enjoy the Hunger Games, it was dark, suspenseful, emotional, dramatic, exciting, had interesting characters and painted a fantastic world.<br /><br />Catching Fire seems to continue this.  Katniss is fresh of the victory and show of rebellion from the 74th Hunger Games, and a half year later we see her getting ready for her victory tour.  She first visits District 11 and we get to see how that differs from District 12 and Katniss has a dramatic moment with the people, further inciting rebellion.  So far so good.  Then, huh? Wha? why?  We zip through the districts, learn nothing about them or their people, then to the Capitol where a string of plot twists that evokes after school special starts rolling through.  Historic events, locations and characters are introduced only when they are relevant to the ever-twisting plot, because Collins thinks you might forget them later (although maybe she is right, this is marketed towards the ADD YA of today).  New characters are cardboard, and the old ones don't change aside from Katniss herself.  And don't bother to read the third book, it continues this streak and never reverts to the immersiveness of the original.<br /><br />The albatross of a love triangle still hangs off this book.  On one hand we have the childhood friend Gale; handsome, resourceful, smart, and always right, his only downside that he knows it.  Then there is Peeta pathetically, hopelessly in love, yet with no other noticeable flaws.  Where in the Hunger Games (first book) he seemed to be torn between wanting to \\"keep things on his terms\\" and not kill anyone verses focusing on preserving Katniss, he now is hellbent on saving her.  The whole thing becomes quite dull as it is brought up again and again with no change.<br /><br />There are a few redeeming qualities; the themes for one are at least interesting.  And the writing style itself is good, but mostly I stuck with it to see what happened.  I should have just read a plot summary.
0439023513|3.0|Mockingjay, the final book of The Hunger Games Trilogy, was again, one that I read in one setting. I had so thoroughly enjoyed the first two books that I had really high expectations for the finale. Unfortunately, I was not as thrilled with the final book. I liked the plot line for the most part. I felt let down by the main character Katniss. Through the first two books, Katniss had really been angry with her mother for how she got depressed following the death of Katniss's father. However, in this book, Katniss seems to follow in her mother's footsteps and just didn't seem to have the same qualities that had seemed to be portrayed throughout the first two books. Still, as this is the end of the trilogy, it is an essential read to finish the series, still I was disappointed.  Overall, I enjoyed the trilogy and I am a new Suzanne Collins fan. As with the other two books, I would give this a PG-13 rating due to the descriptions of the battle scenes.  Kristi Burchfiel, author of applicable Bible Studies and devotionals
B004N66XYE|4.0|The English class system is endlessly fascinating, especially when contrasting the difference between those in the drawing room and those behind the green baize door. This is why Upstairs Downstairs, both the original and the update, Manor House and Gosford Park have been so popular. Viewers can put themselves in the shoes of those both up and down.<br /><br />The new Upstairs Downstairs seeks to update a beloved classic and does a good job. Indeed, my only complaint is that this series was only three episodes long and we didn't get enough complexity in the stories. The story begins with aristocratic newlyweds moving into the family mansion on Eaton Place. The house is re-decorated in the moderne style and that and the costumes are worth the price of admission, especially to lovers of deco. The family is rounded out by relatives who come to stay, in this case, the husband's overbearing mother and the wife's trouble-making sister. German fascists were courting the English aristocracy throughout the thirties and into the forties and the English flirtation with fascism makes an appearance in the person of German Ambassador Ribbentrop and the attendance of the sister and chauffeur at fascist meetings. Jewish refugees come to the household in the form of a university professor turned upstairs maid and her daughter. The class system that will be completely swept away by the end of the war is examined from every perspective. The infamous Mrs. Simpson makes a delightful appearance and English ambivalence to her person and her role is well-played here.<br /><br />All of the elements of a great story are here, but the series is just too short. Episodes need to be longer and stories need to be further developed. Everything felt rushed. Comparison with the superior Downton Abbey are inevitable, but I think this has the potential to be just as good, provided the second season expands on the groundwork laid here.<br /><br />High marks to the costumer and set designer.
B000H2NA30|5.0|This book was fascinating. I read most of it with a lump in my throat. Edith's story is so moving and well written. I especially loved her honesty even in the darkest times of her life. Even if you don't particularly enjoy historical novels, you will certainly enjoy this.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|I found this book to have great dialog (reminiscent of Jack Vance), interesting characters, a picturesque setting with good world building, and a good plot.  It is a great first effort for a new author.  I would give it 5 stars except it dragged a bit for me and perhaps could have been better presented in a slightly shorter length.  Never the less, I look forward to tackling the sequel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is great because if you download this app,you wont have to ever download anymore game apps ever again. when I downloaded this app,I thought it would have cheap easy games,well I was wrong. all of the games are addicting and you could never get bored because there are a lot of games. so if you want about 120 addicting games in one app,for the best part that are FREE and shouldn't be cause there so good, this is the best app in the market and I don't regret buying it.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|When I think about the documentary \\"Inside Job\\" thoughts go through my mind like \\"wish I would have known this years ago.\\"    I wish every American could view \\"Inside Job.\\"  It was really an eye opener for me.  After viewing this documentary I can see the problem(s) are on both sides of the isle, democrat and republican.  If re-enforces the idea of term limits for our political leaders.   If the Wall Street \\"occupiers\\" could see this documentary they would not be on Wall Street, but would be in Washington D.C.  We need to get those bums out of office and start fresh, both sides of the isle.   I recommend \\"Inside Job\\" for every American to see.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I like this app because it makes you think and remember things you have seen and also take a closer look at things you might have ignored before!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this app has me and my brothers busy all day, and has us wake up early just to play it. great app!
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I was definitely a little disappointed with the pacific after loving band of brothers and anticipating what I thought would be an even greater \\"sequel\\" of some kind. I could never really articulate specifically why though. But, after reading other reviews I found many criticisms I agree with. I found the sporadicness of the settings, protagonists, and timeline to be a major detraction. I also had trouble relating to and caring about the characters. Devoting entire episodes to the love interests of Leckie and Basilone subtracted from the message and historical value of the series. If you're trying to fit the entire pacific theatre into ten episodes then they really could have made better use of the time. (Next time I watch it I'll probably skip the entire australia episode.) I've seen the series 2 and a half times now and I still can't remember more than 3 or 4 characters names, the scope of characters is so broad and they try to develop them, but fall short on time to do it and squander the time they do have. I also missed having the narrations that were peppered throughout band of brothers. They provided insight, perspective and intimacy with the characters that was lacking in the pacific. At the end of the day though, it was still a brilliant work of art that I will watch again and again and recommend it to anyone who's never seen it. It was just a bit of a let down after band of brothers. My expectations were high and I was expecting something as good or better. Finally, I'd like to note that the sex, violence and profanity in the series did NOT bother me at all and I was shocked to hear others complain about it their reviews. This was meant to be real and in your face. Yeah, maybe you shouldn't have let your 8 year old watch it. But if you've ever heard of HBO or Spielberg in your life than you'd know they're not big on censorship. If you didn't know, check out Saving Private Ryan, and every HBO series ever made.
0062082353|5.0|An engrossing insider's account of how the battles for the towns and villages of Iraq that we've all read about were fought. Despite the serious nature of its subject, the book is filled with humor and pathos with descriptions of Chris Kyle's feelings for his fellow warriors who he is assigned to protect from ambush in the Iraqui streets.  Comments of his wife Taya vividly illustrate the sacrifices our military has made, not only in terms of the dangers they face, but the repeated separations from family and loved ones. Highly recommended.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I received a gift card for signing up for the visa credit card when I purchased my first order. I had ordered two of the first item and only one was in stock, so the gift card was applied to the CD and it covered the shipping as well. Thank you.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good, basic version of solitaire. It was very intuitive and quite easy to learn. My only dislike is the option for different deal types. I would prefer that all deals be of the simple, random version. Let the cards fall where they may and allow the players success to be dependent upon their skill and the random deal of the cards.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga Book 4)Stephanie Meyer has written another masterpiece of the \\"Twilight Saga\\". She's brought together all of the final components in this vampire love story. Striking descriptions of some scenes almost made you want to stop reading because of the gore, but of course you can't stop, not now. Jacob's true self and feelings towards Bella are finally revealed. Bella continues her raising levels of romance with her lover, Edward. This book is a novel at its finest. Give my compliments to Meyer, bravo.<br /><br />Check It Out! rachelsbookreviews.webs.com

B006MHWXMS|5.0|I would never pay for a to-do list, but when its free you cant argue with that now can you? :3
B0063IH60K|5.0|An excellent game of solitaire.  The ability to select a &quot;winning&quot; hand is a good ego boost when the random deal has beat you a few too many times in a row.  The ads they have are quite unobtrusive and actually come with a skip button unlike a lot of apps.  Highly recommended, and one of the better ports to boot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I WOULD RECOMMMEND THIS SERIES TO EVERYONE.. I love Peeta and Katniss.. and Haymitch. Kindle Rocks too. Oh ya buddy
B004S49Z3W|3.0|After loving the movie, I assumed that the book would be equally enjoyable. Unfortunately, like a few other readers, I found the diary style to become a bit tedious after a while. For some, Bridget Jones was self-indulgent and whiny, but I feel that her \\"imperfections\\" - the paranoia, obsessiveness and self doubt - created a character that seemed authentic, with a 'telling it like it is' approach. Although not in such a way that enforces an unflattering stereotype of single women aged 30+. Granted, Bridget's methods of how to cope with complications with relatioships (between friends and family, as well as certain males) are not ideal, but they provide a window for readers and show what it may be like to have sunk so emotionally low. Overall, it was a good book that was humourous and light, however, the somewhat sudden 'turn around' at the end which was wrapped up in just a few pages made it considerably less believeable.  Maybe not for readers with a strict moral compass.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome app,love this for my HTC inspire. Very easy to use and understand. Great tools too! Can keep track of verses easily and even self study with cool note tool. I recommend this to anyone that loves learning the Truth.

B006BN93JE|1.0|Our Godson asked for this for Christmas. It is an expensive piece of junk with no educational value. My 25 year old daughter, an engineer, played the game with our Godson, 6 years old, on Christmas day.  Within minutes, the door fell off one of the pieces. Additionally, she had difficulty keeping the pieces from falling down when trying to follow the pattern on the cards. Examining the pieces, she noted the plastic was warped on the \\"ice\\" and not cut uniformly. Our Godson quickly became disenchanted as it was too difficult for him to piece together and he was frustrated that the game was not what he expected. It was certainly not for lack of trying. He spent a good deal of time with my daughter and they finally decided it wasn't worth trying to deal with the cheap plastic.  As for the price, it not worth the money whatsoever. For learning, dexterity and imagination, this is a complete zero. I got him a set of Lincoln Logs since this was such a dud. He is having a great time building, creating and using his imagination.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This series is even better in Blu ray.  I love the BBC collection.  The other one with Oprah Winfrey is not very good.  My only wish is this series was in 3D!
030788743X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, especially since it took me back in to my childhood.  Playing a vast amount of Atari games, playing on Tandy's and Commodore 64's with 5 1/4\\" disks that took around five disks just to play Ghostbusters and G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero.  Plenty of references to 80's music, pop culture, and things to help you remember the good ol' days for some.
B0041T52S6|4.0|I loved Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World--I thought it was a pretty good adaptation of the books in addition to being an entertaining movie. It stayed true to the core story and the spirit of the narrative, while taking some licenses with the plot. The styling was perfect for a movie based on a graphic novel based on music nerds and game enthusiasts.  Unfortunately, the special features aren't terribly special. The deleted scenes are mostly just slightly different or less-polished versions of the originals, and the bloopers are turbo lame.
0140120416|5.0|This book is hands down the best text I have found for teaching yourself Russian.  The lessons are broken up into small manageable chunks which clearly explain Russian grammar in a logical manner.  The text starts by explaining the Russian alphabet and ends up with a full-length story in Russian.  This book allows the reader to build a sufficient vocabulary while learning a grammar that is significantly different that English.  Every few chapters the book will give review exercises so the reader can retain what they have learned.  The best part of this book is the extensive answer key.  Unlike other books, the book has an answer and translation for every exercise in the book.  The book was written by a British author so Americans will have to adjust to the English language differences, but that is a very minor issue.  This is an excellent resource for anyone attempting to learn the Russian language.  You won't find anything better.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|This movie is another in a series of movies that link up with Ironman. It's well done bittersweet ending though. This was a lot of fun to watch visually dark but a great start-up story for Captain America.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|This album, while not as strong as Fallen, is still incredible.  By far the best song on the cd is Sweet Sacrifice followed by Snow White Queen.  My least favorite song is Lithium.  But I tend to like the harder rocking, fast paced songs rather than the ballads.  Evanescence has changed their sound somewhat from their debut album, but they still retain the goth metal flavor with orchestral and classical overtones.  Music is not a one-size-fits-all, but if you like darker music with a metal edge (think Within Temptation or Flyleaf) this album is for you.
0312641893|5.0|A sophisticated YA cinderella story and dystopian treat with some very interesting twists: cyborgs, androids, the plague, plus moon people with powers and a kingdom on the moon all work well. I loved this amazing retelling of a fairy tale and especially the details of Cinder's cyborgness and that, as a mechanic, she builds her own \\"coach\\" that eventually gets her to the ball.<br /><br />When her fairy godmother gets smashed and the doctor isn't much help, You'll be hoping Cinder finds love and luxury in a castle. Although the story was satisfying, I missed the HEA. Not even a happy for now. Will have to wait for #2.

0385523912|5.0|I had been waiting to read this book for a while now, and I'm extremely sorry I waited. This book was PHENOMENAL. I was fascinated by every page. The book is so easy to read, despite the extremely serious content. It is structured around the stories of 6 defectors (and their families) and reads almost like a novel.   I am left wanting to read more and more about this topic. This is such a great book for anyone even remotely interested in North Korea.

B005HP2JAM|4.0|As far as 3D is concerned: nothing is unbelievable. Most of the 3D images are repeated images of the same art work contained in the caves over, over, over and over again. After you have seen a run-through of the cave art for the first time, you have seen anything that is special about this long documentary.  Not much changes throughout the entire film. Additionally, due to filming constraints, the camera can only get so close to the caves & their artwork. This limits what you can actually see.    Would have been much more compelling had the film been shortened and the 3D pieces been used more effectively.  Much of the time, you may have trouble correlating what the tour guides are referring or talking about to the actual filming and artwork.  Nothing GREAT, but also nothing bad. Could have been shorter with more effective use of 3D (as in not showing the same pictures over and over and over again).  Not bad.
0486284735|1.0|I am not satisfied with the book`s cover image. I would have greatly prefered to have the movie image as a cover, since I greatly appreciated the movie, and since we are in the 21 century, were we do not have this kind of image. I would have bought the book if the movie image was featured on it.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|If I had to choose my favorite character in this film it would definitely be Ruby (Renee Zellweger). From the moment Ruby appears and rescues Ada (Nicole Kidman) from an aggressive rooster, cranks his head around until you hear a squawk as his neck breaks, to the end of the movie, Ruby is a delight, and was a great part of what made this film so terrific.  Ada was the perfect contrast to Ruby's take-charge, can-do attitude.  I've read some criticism of Jude Law's performance, but I thought his \\"Inman\\" worked out quite well, as did the supporting actors such as Ruby's father and his friends.  Of course there are \\"bad guys\\" in the story, but since good guys usually prevail in a good story, their skulduggery is dealt with in the end.  While this movie is characterized as a Civil War movie, there's very little of the war in it.  A scene or two of what I believe was the Battle of the Crater at Petersburg, is all I recall.  Other than that, the violence is pretty much confined to a few short scenes.  Most of the story is about the woman left behind and how Ada and Ruby survived a difficult time period in our national history.  Both women have their victories. For Ruby, it is a reunion with the father who abandoned her as a child; for Ada it is the eventual return of the man she loves.  Since I'm one who loves happy endings, this story/film ended in a way not expected, and not as happy perhaps as it might have been.  Yet the final scenes were about love, family, friendship, children and acceptance. For Ada, Inman will be always young, strong, and forever protecting her. The sadness passes, memories are cherished, and life is good.
1451648537|2.0|I love biographies and have read many prior to reading this one.  I felt as if this was more of a tale of the rise and fall and rise of Apple instead of the life story of Steve Jobs.  Yes, Apple was Steve Jobs (or, Steve Jobs was Apple) - I do understand that! But Isaacson spent more time on the business aspect of Steve Jobs vs the personal aspect.  Saying that this book did not flow is an understatement. It was all over the place and at times confusing.  The author would jump from one time period to another often.   Isaacson did a terrible job of telling the family story of Steve Jobs. He totally dissed Job's adopted sister and one of his kids.  He barely made mention of the adopted sister - made one reference that they weren't close.  So what? They weren't close but Jobs grew up with this girl and no other mention?  And the daughter that Issacson claims he couldn't connect with?  I'm not referring to the child he had out of wedlock. I'm referring to the daughter he had with his wife. He made note twice that Job's had a problem with her but never really elaborated. Because of this Isaacson made it sound as if Job's didn't like the kid because she wasn't feisty.  And what about his adoptive dad?  The beginning of the book gave credit to this man.  Mentioned that Jobs was such a perfectionist because this was the way his dad was.  Yet there was no other mention of him later on.  His relationship with his dad after he became established was never even touched nor was it even mentioned what happened to his dad years later.  How will Job's kids know their father better by reading this book?  Was that not Job's wish?    Bottom line: if you want to know how Steve Jobs worked Apple buy the book!  If you are looking for a personal in depth biography of the man, you will not find it here.

I also appreciate the fact that I can read passages in various versions of the Bible within YouVersion.  It's a great app, you won't be disappointed.

That being said, it is very difficult to keep up motivation after the first week if you are one who easily bores with repetative workouts. I personally loved this DVD, however, my sister absolutely hates it! If you are a fan of Jillian and her personal style of telling it like it is, you should greatly enjoy this workout. If you're not a fan, look elsewhere! Also, be prepared to BURN after your first workout (if you make it all of the way through the first one) if you don't work out regularly!!

1451627289|5.0|When I was a kid of about 13 I started to read pretty much everything with Kings name on it. That was until \\"IT\\". Man, what a book that was! It brought me in and I felt as if I was in Derry with them being scared out of my wits aong with the characters. But, I will never forget where I was at the end of that book. My dad was driving and we were on our way to St.Louis to visit family when I got to the spider! A spider? Really? 1100 pages of literary greatness and that is what he came up with? My dad yelled at me when I threw the book out the window of the car yelling \\"What a waste of my time!\\" I didn't read anything of Kings after that and vowed to myself that I would never again waste my valuable reading time........................Until 11/22/63.<br />  I must have picked this book up eighteen times reading the synopsis in the cover. I always put it down reminding myself to stick to my vow. I was fight =ing the temptation to buy it because it seemed great. I just kept telling myself that somehow he will ruin the premise of saving Kennedy. It wasn't until my grandmother asked me what I waanted for Christmas that I caved. Hey, I said to myself, I didn't buy it and if she gave it to me I would have to at least honor my wonderful sweet grandmother and actually READ the book.<br />  I was in the middle of one of my in-between book phases I go through by the way. You know, nothing seems good? I recieved this book in the mail on the 23rd of December and finished it on the 28th. (I have 4 kids so that is a very fast read btw) King did this story perfectly. I found myself wishing I lived in the sixties! TIme travel, love, action, drama, history lessons all wrapped up into probably one of the best books I have read in a very, very long time. I would give a perfect score on any sccale! Good job King and I request another!!

1451648537|5.0|Hello,  I have a little story of my own concerning the Mac.  I began my computer usage using the Mac at work even though it seemed that the  majority of of people had PCs and I wondered why.  If I wanted to take a class concerning an application, the class was usually taught using a PC computer.  So, to make things easier for myself, I went out and bought a PC laptop even though I've always had a Mac Desktop.  I hated it.  For me, it was confusing, there was too much going on at once, and the only thing I thought it had going for it was the networking ability since so many others had the same computer plus more software was available for it.  I just started finding applications for the Mac even though it was a little more expensive which bothered me at the time.  I knew virtually very little about Steve Jobs, the man behind the Mac.  However, when he died, I became profoundly sad and  could not understand why.  So sad that I suddenly wanted to know everything about him.  It started with a few articles in magazines, some TV man of the year show, and then I saw the biography.  I was so happy I found something to really learn about it and boy was I surprised.  I have my theories about Mr. Jobs, but I'm not here to analyze Steve - I'm here to tell you that I think 1) that the book was very well written by the author; and 2) I can only read 50 pages at a time, and during this time I was completely mesmerized by who this genius was.  I regret that I never thought to meet him or to come to one of his many releases of his products.  At first I thought the technical part would be boring, but I absorbed every word and sometimes read paragraphs over since they touched me so.  I even started underlying what I considered the most important aspects of Steve's life, quotes, and his own self-reflections.  I have 200 pages to go, and I just don't want it to end.  The more I read, the sadder I get that he has passed on without my getting a chance to see his mesmerizing stare.  I thought to myself, if I had ever worked for someone like him I would have come home crying every day and got ulcers and like the whole Apple industry, Jobs was different and the words \\"Think Different\\" refer to not only his products but to him as well.  Some could consider them weird.  He had the right to be weird because of his genius and I think he did all he did for the people.  He has certainly made me a Mac person for the rest of my life.  Anyone else who I've met that has read this book shares something with me and we have talked hours about Steve Jobs life.  I can't seem to stop talking about it.  A control freak, yes, but look what  he created for all of us including the beautiful atmosphere of his retail stores.  Now I go into them and get a total different feeling.   Again, I could go on & on about this book, but instead I implore you to read it and hopefully get as much out of it as I did (especially for Mac users).  I just read a sentence where Bill Gates was looking at the newly launched iPod and stared at it for a long time.  Finally he said, is this only for Macs?  You'd have to read the book to see why this is amusing.  This is one of the best books I've read in my life - and I only wish it could go on & on.  I was never bored for an instant.  A fan that chooses to love Steve Jobs besides his unkind behavior at times.  Trudi
B0041B4B8G|5.0|This version was a Best Buy Exclusive and is now SOLD OUT, YOU CAN NOT get it online or anywhere else. You might find it on a Best Buy shelf at some out of the way location but more than likely they have all been sold.  Amazon and/or Ebay are the only way to get it now without driving cross country to check all the Best Buy stores.  This was not available at any other retail store like FYE, Wal-Mart or Target as the previous review suggests.

B000008LOV|2.0|A little too hokey pokey and sing song for my taste. I think that the group just basically rested on their individual laurels as performing artists. If you listen to the words of most of the songs it sounds like they just went into the studio to record without having any forethought. I would think that recording artists of this caliber would be able to to at least sound like just didn't drop into the studio just to jam and produce whatever. It sounds disjointed, like they are not connected to each other musically. Overall, rather disapointing after you get over the initial excitement of the combination of the artists. Not a CD that makes me want to listen to it again and again,how about you?
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Lots of fun for the budding artist. Our daughter spends a long time creating her masterpieces. It could use more options for materials to work with and pictures.

0312641893|5.0|Linh Cinder makes a living in New Beijing as a mechanic. More accurately, she makes money for her stepmother, a cruel and selfish woman who hates Cinder for being a cyborg. Cinder may not know how she came to be this way, part mechanical and only part human, but she knows there's nothing she can do to change who she is. She's mostly resigned herself to a life of being treated as a second class citizen when Prince Kai approaches her market stall and asks her to fix his android. What Cinder doesn't know is that there's more to Prince Kai and his android than meet the eye, and that by accepting this job, she's going to become entangled in a high stakes game of disease, deceit, and diplomacy. In a world ravaged by a deadly plague and threatened by a malicious race of lunar people, who would ever think that one cyborg could be so important to the fate of the Earth? Cinder certainly didn't, but now she's about to find out.  Cinder was one of my favorite books read last year, and it will likely continue to be a favorite in the years to come. This is a book that I've been raving about for approximately half a year before its publication because I just couldn't wait for others to see what I was so excited about. It boils down to this: Cinder is one spectacularly written, incredibly imaginative and romantic, futuristic fairytale retelling. Ordinarily, Cinderella as a cyborg is a concept that sounds a little odd to me, but debut author Meyer makes it work wonderfully. Her worldbuilding feels so effortless and integrated that everything from androids to an evolved race of people living on the moon to an unusually deadly plague feels completely natural within the story. This is a novel that readers will find easy to become invested in, because of the vivid characters, the futuristic setting, and the irresistibility of such a good story. I am so thrilled that Cinder marks the first installment in a new quartet, The Lunar Chronicles, and I desperately hope that Cinder makes a reappearance in later books because as much as I'd love to see where Meyer will take us next, I really don't want Cinder's story to be over.  Cinder will be enjoyed by all readers, especially those who also liked the A Great and Terrible Beauty trilogy by Libba Bray, the Poison Study trilogy by Maria V. Snyder, and The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins.

0142419400|5.0|The last thing that Anna Oliphant wants is to spend her senior year of high school at the School of America in Paris. Sure, Europe seems glamorous, but no one seems to be taking into account that Europe means leaving her friends and family back in Atlanta. Besides, Anna can barely speak a word of French. Anna's convinced that her one and only boarding school experience is going to be nothing short of a nightmare--that is, until she meets Étienne St. Clair. He is probably the most prefect specimen of a guy that Anna has ever met: charismatic, charming, gorgeous, effortlessly Parisian, and with a sexy British accent--just utterly irresistible. Too bad Étienne already has a girlfriend. Too bad Anna is still kind of involved with a guy back home. But as the year progresses, Anna and Étienne's easy friendship starts to turn into something more. Will they be able to weather all the drama and find the courage to go after what they really want?  I was a little wary of reading Anna and the French Kiss, only because I have seen people literally go gaga for this book, and I was afraid that I would be disappointed if my own reading experience was nothing short of spectacular. I am pleased to say that while I wasn't totally and completely blown away, I was still wholeheartedly charmed by this sweet and romantic story. Young adult romances are usually my go-to books whenever I feel like smiling (which is basically all the time), and there's no doubt that Anna and the French Kiss should be situated somewhere at the pinnacle of this subgenre. This romance really defies any of my previous conceptions of what YA romance should be; Perkins works around stereotypes and clichés so that her story settles comfortably within the realm of completely realistic. And the best part is that all her characters fit so well there: both Anna and Étienne are perfectly flawed. No emotion is left unexplored, for either Anna or Étienne (finally, a guy not afraid to express his feelings!). In all,Anna and the French Kiss sure is an utterly delightful and truly charming story that gives a good name to frothy romance.   Anna and the French Kiss will appeal to readers who enjoyed Sixteenth Summer by Michelle Dalton, Dash & Lily's Book of Dares by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan, and Beautiful Americans by Lucy Silag.
B000UJBYD8|4.0|I'm puzzled at all the negative reviews around \\"Born Into This.\\"  I purchased this CD the day it was released, and have from the beginning loved it.  It's a very solid, worthwhile CD that anyone listening with open ears should be able to really enjoy.  And I find myself still listening to this fairly often even now four years since its release.    \\"Born Into This\\" may not break a lot of new ground, but who cares when the overall results are so strong.  There are four *exceptional* tracks, a bunch of very good ones, and only one clunker (\\"Holy Mountain\\").  The first of the killer tracks is \\"Diamonds.\\"  Unlike \\"I Assassin\\" which I had an immediate visceral response to, \\"Diamonds\\" initially seemed merely \\"fine\\" but didn't really bite me until about the 3rd listen.  I pay no attention to the lyrics of this song (they seem indistinctive), but musically there's something very different in \\"Diamonds\\" than I've heard in any other song by The Cult.  There's a hungry, nervous energy that drives the song, with musical effects that remind me of giant bells tolling.  I don't know of any other Cult song like it, and it's outstanding.  \\"Diamonds\\" opens with a drum machine beating away in the background, and then commences with crunching, bell-tolling guitars that set the very dark mood of the song.  Four years later, I can say without hesitation that \\"Diamonds\\" is one of my very favorite Cult songs.  \\"I Assassin\\" is a visceral, brutal, crunching song that represents The Cult at their very best.  \\"Illuminated\\" is also a great song, starting in the major key and then quickly turning darker as it shifts into the minor minor key once Ian starts his particularly impassioned singing.  And I love \\"Sound of Destruction,\\" a strong finish to a strong record.    Interestingly, \\"Dirty Little Rockstar\\" is a song that I always thought was \\"OK\\", but after having heard The Cult play it live several times, my appreciation for the song has gone up (and it was definitely one of those rare songs thatcomes across better live).  The title track opens strongly, but I think the chorus is weak compared to the intro/verse music.    The musicianship on \\"Born Into This\\" is excellent.  Ian Astbury is not even a little bit dialing it in, and sings with commitment, passion, and at times as if his life depended on it.  Billy Duffy's guitar work is as excellent as it always is, and the rhythm section is outstanding (my appreciation for John Tempesta as one of rock's best current drummers always goes up every time I see these guys live).  I rank \\"Born Into This\\" in the upper-tier of The Cult's body of work.  I'm not saying it's the best thing they've done (it's not--that CD is their self-titled CD), but I do listen to it more than many of their other CDs.

The five, four, and three star reviews are absolutely incomprehensible to anyone who loves Austen and James.  Granted, Ms. James is 90 years old, but where, oh where, were the editors? Don't buy it, don't even read it, even if someone gives you a copy. It will only make you very, very sad that Jane and James have been so poorly served.

It changes from past to present but both stories were compelling & entwined and kept me turning the pages so that I finished in 2 days right before Christmas (my busiest time of year). Just couldnt put it down.<br /><br />I want to send a bouquet to Vanessa- it would consist of<br />Bird of Paradise, pink Carnations, Coriander, Freesia, Lupine, Peach & Tulips<br /><br />& now that I'm finished reading... I need zinnia - lots of zinnia. (I mourn your absence).
B006JIVRYA|3.0|I have watched this series from the beginning and I still am not sure how I feel about it, I fine the show just kinda ok. I kept watching it wondering if it was going to get better (it really didn't in my opinion). I had to order this one because I missed the TV airing and I couldn't find it free online. I don't think I'll waste my time with season 2 (if there is a season 2). As I recall this one actually one of the better episodes in the season for what it's worth.

B006DHAT5K|2.0|girl revists 20 ex-boyfriends to see if one of them was her true love and discovers she has feelings for the guy next door who has one night stands and can't stay in a committed relationship. together they find their true selves & they live happy ever after. anna feris and chris evans have good chemestry on screen and their relationship is the only thing that makes the movie work, the rest of the movie is confused at what its trying to be. is it a chick flick or a slightly ranchy film? the movie suffers from crude dialogue and pleanty of sex jokes that just don't work. I laughed at some things but I would say its very mediocre, it has it moments but has some problems.
0312641893|5.0|In New Beijing, Cinderella does not dance with Prince Charming in glass, sparkling slippers. Cinder lives in a society plagued by fast and fatal diseases. She is a futuristic Cinderella,a cyborg and mechanic, who has no memories of her past and lives with a cruel stepmother and two stepsisters. Cinder wants to escape; she is tired of giving her stepmother all her money and being belittled and looked down on. Then, before Cinder can flee, her kind, younger stepsister contracts the plague; her stepmother sells her to a team of royal scientists hoping to cure the mysterious disease.<br /><br />Dr. Erland, head scientist, discovers that Cinder just may be the cyborg he was looking for. With this discovery, Cinder could be the key to unlocking a cure that would save both her young stepsister Peony and the King of New Beijing. Coming back to the palace would also give Cinder a chance to continue seeing Prince Kai, the kingdom heartthrob who does not know Cinder is cyborg. Even with the potential for all these good things, Cinder senses that Dr. Erland is keeping a secret from her; Queen Levana from the moon is threatening war on all of Earth.<br /><br />Smart, funny, and brave, Cinder is noble. She works to protect the people she loves and tries to follow her dreams. Marissa Meyer was extremely creative and wove an intriguing twist on this well known fairytale. Although Meyer's work follows all the tenets of a Cinderella story, Cinder is completely unique. Ages thirteen and up would definitely enjoy Cinder. The noble heroine and moral issues proposed give readers food for their thoughts. This book is too captivating to put down. Cinder earns five out of five stars for its memorable heroine and Meyer's creativity.<br /><br />*Complimentary copy received for this review, does not affect my opinion in any way*
B006MHWXMS|3.0|On a honeycomb tablet, app has a nice layout. However, some glaring oversights mar this app: 1) Doesn't pick up the localized date format, 2) Mishandles the calendar for Leap Year, 3) must re-edit a task to make it a recurring task, and 4) the widget doesn't support semi-transparent backgrounds or other options that most of us expect when configuring our widgets.

098357670X|5.0|I was really searching for such a book, that exactly gave me what I wanted.  I bumped into Tom Richmonds book and WebSite, when I was searching for support to re-activate my sleeping talent of drawing. I can tell you, it really woke me up!  After watching the review on YouTube, it was clear, that I need this book.  It took some weeks to get it to Germany, but the bigger was the fun and happyness when I had it in the mail and in my hands.  Beneath its excellent drawings of well known artists and other VIP´s it provides simple descriptions and hints how to draw a charicature. Step by step, Tom gives an analytical view on all parts of the humans face and the typical features that makes a face unique. He gives out a set of rules and tools on drawing charicatures, that will keep you well equiped to start your hobby or improve your drawing skills.   It is so motivating, that you really will feel pain if pencil and paper is out of reach. If drawing addiction is not a desease yet, this book could create it.   The book lays open all the secrets about caricature drawing and gives you the right key to the door. You just need to learn how to handle it ... practice, practice, practice ... that is the only thing the book can´t give.   Even if you are not a graphical artist, this book is a peace of art and worth to buy.   By the way, I have ordered two copies to be on the save side ... GERMAN ANGST ;-)
B005FITIGO|5.0|From the start, when the 'hatchet guys' showed up..everybody waited in anticipation and dread. \\"Am I still employed or now fired?\\"  I remember that day many years ago..when we were unceremoniously 'downsized' from a corporate, impersonal decision.  Then, straight from that to the uncovering of being over-leveraged and in deep trouble. ( Sounds like the Lehman Brothers meltdown..) All the characters were incredible. You find yourself caring about them and their dilemmas.<br />Well worth watching. Also, gives some insight about the crash of 2008.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I'll admit that I read through this entire book in less than 2 days.  It was very intriguing and certainly kept me captivated.  However, the plot was somewhat predictable and just slightly redundant.  That being the case, it brought so much clarity and yet more questions to the characters you've come to know and love.  If you're a fan of the first book you will likely enjoy the second.  Just don't be surprised if you find yourself saying, \\"Haven't I seen this before?\\"

0307474259|1.0|This was a good read. Another great research to confirm that refined grains and sugar are indeed poisons. But recommending sausages, pepperoni and hot dogs as daily eats? Good luck... There is a similarly mind boggling praise to lard somewhere in the book (no kidding). Author brings Inuit people's diet of 100% meat and animal fat with no veggies or fruits in a life time. But he forgets to mention that Inuit, Eskimo or Chukchi etc. people are considered (AND DO LOOK THE PART) old men after 30. So good luck with that too.

1451648537|5.0|I can see why Steve Jobs requested this author to do his biography.  It has to be one of the most well written books I have read and I am a pretty consumate reader.  I highly recommend it just for the pure history of technology and the players, as well as the quirkiness and innovation of Steve Jobs and the use of his reality distortion field.  Very interesting and contemporary.
B00008RH3L|3.0|This is not a bad movie, but The Godfather was made a while ago. You can't improve on genius. Also, there's something about British actors trying to speak in an American accent that doesn't quite work. Albert Finney is a terrific actor but doesn't quite work here. You can see the Coen Brothers honing their skills, though. It's worth watching for that alone.

B005NS0VNU|3.0|The copy of this disc that 1 received had 2 serious glitches on cd #1. Track 2 and track 10 both have similar problems. Radio Free Europe's hiccup occurs at 2:05 and Fall On Me at 1:25. This was a store bought copy and not a download.<br /><br />Further, the track listing on the label of both discs were identical, making it impossible to detect if you were playing disc 1 or 2.<br /><br />Pretty inexcusable sloppy work on the part of WB.<br /><br />Check your copies and pitch a fit if you hear these blunders.

Everything they do is great, whether it's covers of Junior Kimbrough or hip hop with Wu Tang or rock/pop with Danger Mouse.
0525421580|2.0|Reading level: Ages 14 and up?  i'd say more like 14 and under, and if you've read john green's other books already then more like just not at all. there's a lot of banal scene setting, establishing the main character, who is exactly the same as the main character of his last two novels. and yes he is rewriting his high school life again so the awkward geek gets the cool girl but in this case the girl is a less central character.   at the halfway point there's some setups for the characters daily lives to change but instead the second half of the book is the journey of putting everything back the way it was at the start. solving their new problems so they can get back to worrying about the ones they started with.   we're reminded almost every page of the irony of Tiny's name. it turns out he's a pretty big guy. like really large. and he's named tiny. did you know tiny is a big guy? i don't know if we've covered the fact that tiny is a big guy. isn't that hilarious? i just need to reiterate again that tiny is in fact a really big guy.   also it turns out gay teenage boys aren't horny, just really into love and romance. just like all John Green's main characters. but they're also free to go out at any time of day or night without their parents expecting much of an explanation. he's struck the perfect middle ground between John Hughes and Disney. it gets more and more like a PSA about respecting your parents and peers and being forgiving because making peace is always the right choice as it goes on. the characters who were previously governed by pride and insecurity suddenly just do the noble highroad thing for no apparent reason other than setting a good example for the kids.   David Levithan doesn't patronize his readers to the same extent as John Green. his character is darker and more substancial, but even he becomes formulaic with the same cynical musings on society, one-liners and alienated self-reflection recurring to the point of tedium without much changing orprogressing.
B0053O89KG|2.0|This is easily one of the best productions anywhere in terms of the characters, their interaction, the intrigue and the writing quality for the show. However I am constantly intrigued as to why in an age when just about every household has by now at least one 1920 x 1080P capable large screen TV that we see productions the likes of this released on DVD only. Guys, DVD was released in 1995 (yes 17 years ago) to replace VHS to improve the picture quality on 68cm cathode ray tubes that had a resolution of 576 lines. Believe it or not we have moved on. In Australia we get this broadcast in what can only be described as pitiful resolution and unfortunately having purchased season 1 and 2 on DVD apart from having 5.1 sound as opposed to stereo there is little benefit as the picture quality on DVD is little better. I have purchased the likes of Hawaii Five 0, The Mentalist and White Collar on Blu-Ray and the picture quality is fantastic, why on earth can we not have the best show about on the same format? Amazon have had season 3 Blu Ray listed since adam was a boy and still no sign of this being available. So ABC and Buena Vista Home Entertainment how about it? And while you are at it season 1 and 2 as well! I won't be buying any more until you do!

1439102732|5.0|SING YOU HOME BY JODI PICOULT is a very good listen, although at some points I was inclined to stop listening because of the seeming first approaches to the main issues.Jodi is one of my favorite authors because in all her excellent novels, she deals with very real social concerns of our times and portrays characters coming from all different sides of the issues.  Her novels always have great depth of research and great depth of character and the people who live in her novels act out all kinds of situations that keep the reader/listener breathless in the various situations and the ways in which they deal with them.  This one shows the heartaches of family relationships and these are set against some of the most pressing moral issues of our times and the legalities involved in various difficult court cases.  To tell more of this story would spoil the novel for you, but it is an EXCELLENT and COMPELLING listen/read.  Stick with it all the way to its surprise ending. I was glad I did.
B005M5OSBK|4.0|This is a nifty compilation of some of Pink Martini's choicest tunes, ideal both for avid fans of the mercurial musicians or for business owners merely seeking an ideal 70-plus minute disc of heady background sounds to lure customers into their establishments.<br /><br />While \\"A Retrospective\\" does not necessarily contain all of Pink Martini's best work - all the better to get the casual fans to look toward the back catalogue - it works in providing an excellent, well-oiled sampling of the sprawling range of the group, with nearly all their thus-far conceived sonic palletes well-represented throughout the 21 tracks.<br /><br />Some non-instrumental which feature vocalist China Forbes' vocals upfront in the mix, such as the oddball, pretentious \\"Hey Eugene,\\" do not fit in as well or measure up to the quality of softer, more meditative sounds (\\"Aspettami,\\" \\"Kikuchiyo to Mohshimasu\\"). However, such is often the case with compilations.<br /><br />The 13-member orchestra have certainly carved out an esteemed niche for themselves among record buyers who enjoy their genuine versatility, cool, lush sounds, world music beats and eclecticism.  \\"A Retrospective\\" is therefore not only a compilation for the casual listener but a celebration of Pink Martini's success in a fickle music industry.<br /><br />Until Pink Martini returns with a new full-length effort, \\"A Retrospective\\" should tide over listeners nicely.
B004WR125O|1.0|I purchased this adapter along with an Onkyo 609 receiver. The receiver has been working fine ( still figuring out its quirks and how to use much of its features ) and now I just plugged in the adapter to try to connect to my home network. It autmatically brought up the wireless setup screen but the screen was frozen. I could not use the remote to select an option or exit the screen. If I hit 'setup' to go to the main menu, it would do so but then quickly revert to the wireless setup menu. I tried restarting the receiver, unplugging and plugging the adapter back in, turning the receiver on and off both with the adapter in and not, but nothing helped. I took out the adapter and can now access the receiver's functions but the remote can no longer control the volume. Mute and all other buttons work fine but I have to use the dial on the receiver to adjust the volume. The red light on the remote flashes when I hit the volume button but nothing changes. I will contact Onkyo in the morning but this is aggravating. I hope they can resolve this for me. Will update if any changes.
B0061JPYX2|4.0|It is something to note that the late and wonderful Amy Winehouse's versatility was such that, at the time of her death, she had collaborations with both Tony Bennett and Nas which had yet to see release. They are among many fine recordings featured on the unfortunately-titled \\"Lioness: Hidden Treasures.\\" That she sounds equally at home with a trailblazing rapper and the Great American Songbook's greatest living representative speaks to her uniqueness and far reach in the music world.<br /><br />\\"Lioness...\\" is not a follow-up to Winehouse's final album, the career-making marvel that was \\"Back to Black,\\" but a compilation of previously unreleased material. This means some of it was intended for release, while other songs were not meant to see the light of day. While it is easy to see which tracks fit which criteria, the results are worth a listen because Winehouse was a compelling, enigmatic singers who forced listeners to care.<br /><br />Tracks such as \\"Half Time\\" and \\"Wake Up Alone\\" are mere table scraps when seen in the light of material more polished and fully-realized. However, when in the context of \\"Tears Dry,\\" a relatively lackluster original take on what would evolve to be her masterpiece \\"Tears Dry on Their Own,\\" it is likely they could have progressed into being masterpieces of their own. She was by all means a thoughtful songwriter to whom verve, nuance and soul came naturally.<br /><br />Winehouse is in her element when wringing out the emotion of every syllable on \\"Body and Soul,\\" alongside Tony Bennett, or wrapping her warm, velvety instrument around Leon Russell's evergreen \\"A Song for You.\\" The only problem is that the latter is moderately inhibited by over-busy production, with too much percussion and her vocals mixed down too low.<br /><br />How lovely, though, that she recorded this absolute gem of a song - a singer's merit can often be judged by his or her interpretation of \\"A Song for You,\\" and hers is not only a joy but uniquely hers.<br /><br />While \\"Lioness: Hidden Treasures\\" is not a flawless release, it is certainly a necessary one. It reminds of Winehouse's uncanny talent and unrequited potential. We can only hope a few more gems drip out of the vault.wless release, it is certainly a necessary one.

B001HN6918|3.0|The original Kung Fu Panda movie gets five stars and ranks among my favorite animated films despite what some have called a formulaic storyline.  It combines a well-executed story with heart, impressive animation, creative action scenes, strong characters voiced by a great cast, and is topped off with a lush score by Hans Zimmer.  I was happy when I heard there was going to be a sequel.  Kung Fu Panda 2 is a decent movie, but, sadly, feels more like an attempt to cash in on the success of its predecessor than an honest effort to craft another fine tale from the elements of the first.  We are quickly shown a backstory, using 2D animation, to get us to the central conflict of the story, which, strangely, seems like an indirect threat to our heros at best and someone else's problem at worst.  Gone from this sequel's storyline is a theme worthy of the original's: \\"There is no secret ingredient--it's just you.\\"  That thoughtful subtext was cleverly arrived at through two story elements: The secret-ingredient soup and the film's MacGuffin--the Dragon Scroll.  In KFP2, we're treated to Po's journey for \\"inner peace\\"--which really just falls in his lap at the end rather than developing naturally from his experiences in the film.  There is a side story about Po's attempt to find out who his biological family is, which helps flesh out his backstory.  However, the development of the other characters is more shallow this time around; the villain especially feels underdeveloped.  Even the humor falls short of the original.  The animation looks very good, but there's nothing to top the creatively choreographed action of the first, such as Tai Lung's exciting jail-break or Po's showdown with him later.  In checking KFP2's credits, I see that the screenwriters are the same as for the original, but there's a new director: Jennifer Yuh, who is a relative newcomer to directing.  It's hard to say if the blame falls with her or with the screenwriters who were just unable to capture lightning in a bottle for a second time.  KFP2's ending suggests we're in for a third installment.  I'm hopeful a third film will have a lot more of the magic found in the first one.

B004QK5N5W|4.0|Product worked as described with no hassles at all; however, due to the weight of the two end connectors alone and the additional weight when the HDMI cable is connected I can see the stress on the cable itself.  With this stress on the cable I don't see the cable lasting too long as many of the Apple USB cables do break apart due to the same problem.  I wish Apple would put a 1\\" stress relief on each end of the cable by the connectors to solve this problem.  How do you notice the stress issue is the cable if it's hanging on the iPad side will fall off/disconnect and you'll go ballistic especially if you're on NetFlix.

B0063GORYU|4.0|I love this game and this is a good solid version. My only complaint is that the tap sometimes moves cards to odd places instead of what would make the most logical sense - like a queen moved to an empty slot instead of the open king right next to it. Since part of your stats are # of moves, this can be frustrating. The ads before every deal are annoying, but, hey, FREE.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|I love the UI and if I only had one Google account this app  would be a perfect 5 stars! But I need support for multiple Google accounts like 'Google Tasks Organizer' provides. I give it +3 stars for nice UI and excellent functionality and -2 stars for lack of real world capabilities.<br /><br />Conclusion: Definitely worth buying if you only have one Google account to sync (5 stars in that scenario.) Definitely not the app for you you have multiple Google accounts to sync.

B00393SFU2|5.0|This movie is more than 80 years old.  It is in German.  It is an early film to make use of sound.  Yet for all that, it could not be more modern.  The writing is flawless, the acting phenomenal, the editing a marvel.  The camera work is a bit sketchy by modern standards, yet it also breaks new ground for its day.  In every way M is a delight to watch.  It explores the psyche of a sociopath.  It portrays morality in shades of black, white, and gray.  And, interestingly, as a movie to come out of Germany in 1931 it deals with subjects and images that really call to mind the upcoming Nazi immergence (goose-stepping policemen, \\"papers please,\\" a public willing to give up rights for security, etc.).  Truly a masterpiece of early cinema.  The blu-ray transfer is also very good.  There are of course artifacts and other issues with the picture, and at times the sound is less than perfect.  But I have no doubt that the quality is as good as you will ever find for this film.  Remember, it is 80 years old!
B0015DROBO|3.0|Larsson does it right in this great mystery!  I kept wondering what the hype was about the \\"girl with the dragon tattoo\\" was all about because it wasn't until about halfway through the book that she started to take center stage.<br /><br />I read the book first, then watched the movie and really enjoyed the ride.  I had my own view of the characters and to see what they did with the movie gave me a different perspective.<br /><br />Larsson wove a deep web that was hard to follow at first, plus the foreign names made it a tad bit confusing, but not impossible.<br /><br />As the mystery unfolded Larsson added just enough to give the reader a good feeling by the end, even if the protagonist walks way heartbroken (actually I have a hard time calling Salander the main character even though she is the namesake of the book).<br /><br />Finally, I think I have a much better feeling about the book because I backed it up by seeing the movie.  The long road to the meat of the novel seemed worth it once I got their and forgot about the uphill road it took to get there.

Supergroup, Chickenfoot, composed of former Van Halen members Sammy Hagar (vocals) and Michael Anthony (bass), solo artist Joe Satriani (guitar) and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, know how to keep folks guessing.<br />First off they dispell the label supergroup. \\"We're not a supergroup, we like hanging out together and the music is a bonus. We just happen to be in other groups,\\" Sammy said.<br />Second, they say Chickenfoot was just a name they used until they could come up with something better. But fans started hearing it and interpeted it as a weird looking peace sign \\"footprint of the chicken.\\" So the guys stuck with it.<br />Third, they recorded the self-titled Chickenfoot (2009). They released Chickenfoot III a little while ago. There was no album between one and three.<br />Sammy Hagar - released a video that playfully speculated whatever happened to the seemingly overlooked Chickenfoot II album:  \\"Behind the Foot: The Truth Behind Chickenfoot II.\\"<br />Joe said, \\"We promised never to talk about it so I'm surprised we're talking about it now.\\"<br />They know how to play us, but in reality don't have to.<br />This is some of the best rock to come around in years especially the heartfelt unemployed anthem, \\"Three and a Half Letters\\" and the down and dirty \\"Different Devil.\\"
B0063T12RM|5.0|Finally an important show of Great Pina's work. But, why $ 37.98 for a zone 2 dvd - plus shipment charges? You could get it direct from the British Amazon site for 8.99 english sterling pounds - plus about $ 5,00 shipment, which altogether is about half the price what the other sellers for this item are requesting. So far, there is available even a 3D blu-ray - and a regular 2D blu ray - in blu-ray-zone 2. Why not for the USA - blu-ray zone 1? Ah!, the merchants ... When will this nonsense about dvd and blu-ray regions stop. Greed is godd and necessary, but excesive greed is bad and stupid for everybody.
1904994679|5.0|I have been buying these for my son as a Christmas gift for about 10 years (he's 30 now and has come to expect them each year). He really enjoys both reading and collecting the books. I have also found out that I paid too much by making the mistake of buying this book a few of the early years from a bookstore or even Walmart for much more than Amazon charges for it. I never get my books anywhere but Amazon anymore. The prices and quick shipping (plus free shipping when available) cannot be beat by any other retailer, brick & mortar or online.
1451627289|5.0|Enough has been said about the plot of this novel, so I don't need to go there but suffice it to say, this is an incredible book. I suppose my fascination with the book had to do with the fact that I grew up during the time of the Kennedy assassination and remember that day so well. The times were so much simplier then that many younger readers will find it almost impossible to imagine how we lived in the 60's. It was an awesome time to grow up!  In my opinion, this is some of King's best work. He did an incredible amount of research to write this novel. Buy it and read it; you won't regret doing so!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Extremely realistic, soothing app. Love the 3 layer effect with 80 sounds from which to choose. Works perfectly on the Kindle Fire.
1451648537|5.0|I have always admired Steve Jobs and his passion for his work. He was a genius with a dark side that surfaced with many of the people around and close to him; this trait, however, did not interfere with his gift of coming up with ideas for the most incredible electronics the world has ever known during his lifetime. I loved this book and learned so much about the creation and progression of what would become Apple. Too bad he died so terribly young; the world lost a great man!  A highly recommended read!
B005I6EU48|5.0|Having just purchased my very first kindle (touch) I knew a cover of some sort was a necessity if I was to carry it with me in my purse.  I searched every store I went into and did a lot of online window shopping trying to decide which one I liked, which one fit my needs, which one would hold up in quality and workmanship and which one would fit my particular device.  I picked this one up and set it back down several times in the stores.  I loved the way it looked and felt but I wasn't sure about those little elastic straps on the corners to hold my kindle in.  I thought they might be loose or flimsy and that would negate the entire use of the cover.  Eventually Christmas came and this one ended up under the tree for me.  Now that I have it on my kindle and am using it I LOVE THIS COVER.  I still like the way it looks and feels.  Closed it looks like a nice old book, classy in appearance, and feels like hard bound leather.  open it feels like a book... the old fashioned kind with pages that you turn.  The cover is sturdy and strong and I can't find any flaws in the workmanship.  The inside is a soft material that I can't stop rubbing my hands across and I know will protect my device.  And those elastic corners that I was worried about?  Snug and strong.  This is a quality elastic, not the cheap stuff that falls apart after a few uses or loses its elasticity.  My Kindle Touch doesn't budge in this case.  Just a warning, the magnet that you think this device has holding it shut when you pick it up in the store is simply packaging.  Once the packaging is removed the magnet is gone.  I don't have any problems with this cover staying shut, even without a strap or latch of any sort. The cover is weighty enough that the strap isn't necessary.
1451627289|3.0|I'm not a Stephen King fan.  I've only read Misery and that only after seeing the film.  What drew me to this book was the idea of someone witnessing the lead up and aftermath of the Kennedy assassination.  11/22/63 caught my attention right away and I thought the wormhole into the past was extremely well done.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the loving details of life pre-Internet, pre-birth control and pre-cable TV.  King does an excellent job of placing the reader back in time.<br /><br />The problem is that there were too many pages.  Too many murders and beatings that add up to nothing and that have nothing to do with Oswald or Kennedy.  By the time Sadie and Jake are racing to stop Oswald it felt anti-climatic.  We have seen a variation on this theme several times already.<br /><br />Finally, I'm not sure of what 11/22/63 is saying.  That we shouldn't try to change the past?  That the past is as perilous as the present just that we have forgotten?  That JFK was killed by lone assassin?  It was readable I give you that but it didn't make me want to run out and buy, \\"The Shining.\\"
B000MD9UJC|3.0|I really wanted to modernize my 15+ year old mini-MAGs because it shamed me to waste them in favor of higher-output, more efficient, but cheap and junky LEDs. I was enthused so much that I knowingly ignored another review for this product that already said what I'll say again.  This product may be exactly what you want but you may find you didn't want *this* one!  Its coffin is nailed entirely by its own surprisingly poor workmanship! (And, once again, I really wanted to like this thing!) I immediately noticed the push-button in the tailcap audibly rattles within the assembly. Then I observed the button cap's sloppy fit.  I wouldn't expect the switch to bear normal use for long. Regarding the switch there is [what I view to be] a design flaw that will annoy some people. The kit doesn't address the original power switching mechanism; you can turn your flashlight off three ways (OFF, OFF) (ON, OFF), (OFF, ON) and on only one (ON, ON). If you just pick up the light and you don't know its switch states, you'll be playing around to turn the light on.  For poor quality and the switch \\"uncertainty\\" I do not even consider using this switch at all.  The LED is really quite bright (enough for my needs) and the reflector is adequate. I'm not a connoisseur. The problem with these is their fit into the head assembly. I installed the kit (like a regular light bulb, but mind polarity!) and as I replaced the head I heard plastic grinding. The LED leads were twisted around each other; the attached reflector didn't stay clear of the rotating head. I tried many more times, trying hard to center it as best I could. Funny that I was resolved to give up, and on that final attempt there was no grinding.  The light seems to work well and I'm not going to take it apart. The LED better last as long as they say it will!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I love the Hunger Games series. I followed till the end. Now I am giving everyone fair warning. Katniss is now flickering out. The girl you knew is torn up, burned, juiced, and ground up by the beginning. Now take in the wash, rinse, and repeat. And repeat. And repeat. Add a little more smoldering. Repeat. By the end she is in ruins from an almost literal volcanic explosion. She finally decides what will get her through the mess and The End. Now with this in mind, you must go and read the book. Do not let my jurisdictions stop you. Set store to my warning and you will love the book. On My Honor. Enjoy!!!
B0041XXQ4Y|4.0|I got this as a gift for my friend. I was a lazy reader and wasn't expecting it to be a scroll poster, but I think that added to the surprise. The only problem that came to our mind was that we didn't have a way to hang it up. There are no holders or string or anything, so she'll probably have to glue some string onto the sides. Other than that, it is awesome.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great app esp considering it is free. I have it on both my phone and my kindle.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I think that this item is way overpriced for the quality of what you get.  The pink outer shell is very sturdy.  However, the black flap part is flimsy.  I do like the band that wraps around and keeps everything tight and secure.  I also think it is uncomfortable to type while using this product. The Fire Kindle is a not meant to type emails, etc.- just an outlet to Amazon's resources.  I think that the product should be priced cheaper and be more durable.  I would probably buy this item again only because I researched this item and it seemed the best for the money.  No funny smells or weird textures.
1588167461|5.0|I received this book yesterday and have read through the first couple of chapters. I am a typical nerdy engineer type with very little dress sense. However, I have recently decided to change that and have been shamelessly asking help from my wife and her friends. This book is a great combination of 'cookbook' (X works better with Y than Z) and guide (this is why X works better with Y than Z). Not all things are explained in detail, but it's a good start.  I think the lack of color photos adds rather than detracts from the experience. The book is NOT about current fashion trends, but on acquiring a timeless style. As such, the black-and-white pictures are extremely helpful in seeing the fundamental style of the clothes, which was exactly my goal here. Another huge plus is that it does not recommend specific brands or expensive gear. It's all about a very minimalist wardrobe with a few well-chosen items that can be mixed-and-matched for a wide range of occasions. I also highly appreciate the cleaning and maintenance tips for different kinds of clothing.  I think this is a great purchase for somebody who wants to look a million bucks without being gimmicky (and without spending that amount!).
B0041C09Y0|5.0|Fairly violent, but very entertaining show.  I found it on prime and watched the first season in just a few days.  The characters are all good in that they are all torn/broken in one way or another.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|not that great. hard to control. I had hoped for games that were more skill based instead of just tapping your finger or moving your finger and hoping that it works. some fun games but some just really hard to.control. and a lot of ads.
0307387178|2.0|Krakauer obviously thought that his Outside magazine article on Chris McCandless would make him a few more bucks published as a book.  In a nutshell: An idealistic, naïve young college graduate who has neither survival training nor any practical experience in the outdoors rejects his comfortable middle-class upbringing, gives all his savings to charity, re-christens himself with a new BS name (Alexander Supertramp), and after wandering around out West for a while hitchhikes to Alaska, hikes into the Alaskan wilderness alone and starves to death.   Not really worth your time to read. Krakauer's other book, Into Thin Air, is far better.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I researched information on this product before I made my purchase. When I received it, The back seemed very secure and protective of my kindle. The problem with it is that the face cover is extremely flimsey and poorly made. After reading previous reviews and hearing what a great product this was, I was dissapointed.  The cover never stays shut and how the \\"stand\\" works is the flimsey cover folds in half and about half way up the back of said product is a factory cut. The cover gets placed into the cut and, that's it. It falls over easily.   I rated this product with two stars instead of one because it seems like the back half is going to be protected fine.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I tries Google Task after using this app and I found it is easier to use than Google task for example the task is allowed to repeated daily, weekly and monthly.  I am hopping it also has the function to record the percentage completed.  I will use this app to track my new year resolutions.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|In my opinion, this is best Amy Winehouse CD.  I love her new Hidden Treasures and can sing along to every song on Back to Black.  But Frank is my favorite of the 3.

B0063IH60K|4.0|good functionality.  responsive and quick. I like playing it and listening to music stored on cloud. one touch is cool too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app its one of my favorite apps I have I play it all the time. I reccomend it for really good gamers.
1451648537|2.0|While I love the subject, the book is shallow and repetitive. What was said in 630 pages could have been done in less than 200. At the same time many interesting angles were left unexplored. For instance, rather than repeating one liners about Jobs' personality it would have been interesting to get a perspective with some psychological depth.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I loved \\"My So Called Life\\". I watched this series when it was on ABC in 1994-1995.  It was an excellent series; well written, well acted, wonderful story's each week, but short lived.  Sorry to have seen it end as quickly as it did.  I would like to see it return as a modern day series. It touches on so many issues for young and older generations who can relate to even today.  I was so happy to be able to get the entire season on DVD.  It is about the trials of a teenager Angelia Chase and her new found friendships with Rayann and Ricky as well as the love of her life Jordan.  The emotions run deep with all of the characters in the series including excellent story's surrounding Angelia's parents and their search for who they are and their struggles in life, love, friendship and ambitions.  Sometimes the stories between Angelia and her friends and her parents lives parallel each other.
B0052OZJQO|5.0|The soundtrack to the movie Pina is as vital and exciting as Pina was, and all of her company continues to be! Wim Wenders knows how to translate the magic of one form exquisitely into another. A passionate selection of music that reminds us why were are alive. We are here to experience this.
B005K2YXHO|5.0|Just what I needed. Kindle fits snugly. Fabric is high quality and colors are true to the picture. Inside is soft and lined so that the Kindle won't get scratched.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I caved and finally got this set because it is after all Star Wars on Blu-Ray. The picture and sound quality were great. I saw detail I had never seen in any previous viewings. I did however cringe at some of the changes made and found them distracting...took me out of the movies for a time, but I still think it's a worthy buy because it's the only offering from Lucas on Blu-ray at the moment.
0545265355|5.0|The books were a good price, they arrived quickly and they were just what we ordered- a boxed set. My daughter loved them and I have read the first one as well.
B001IFZL50|5.0|Great for someone not looking for another Rambo. It reminds me of Jarhead and Blackhawk Down put together. So if that sounds intriguing you'll love it.
B0002BO05S|5.0|I am completely satisfied with the dvd that I ordered from amazon. Ordering it was extremely easy and I received it in a timely matter. I would definitely order again from Amazon.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This item was shipped super fast, and in awesome condition!  LOVE this movie!  Watch it all the time LOL!  Very well done, and of course the actors and all the Secretariats that were used, very well done... Great Flick
B00144VBBS|5.0|Great CD - all the songs we love were there. Toby Keith has an excellent voice and the songs bring back loads of good memories.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun to play. Nicely laid out and very responsive. And to think, Ai used to play this with a worn deck of cards.
0375842209|3.0|I know that this is an immensely popular book and that I will upset some people, but I have to say that I found it to be just okay. I liked the unique perspective of having Death be a first person narrator. That seemed to be the main hook to the story.  The adventures that Rudy and Liesel had were entertaining and my favourite part of the plotline. The rest of the story? Meh. It was slow and rambling often without any clear direction.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I thought this was a great game and its free. who could ask for a better deal? I enjoy it.

B002BWP49C|4.0|Although I am a Twilight Fan, I feel this movie was the most different from the book.  It included more than 1 scene of Bella and Edward playing a board game on their honeymoon, but did not show them snorkeling with fish or playing with dolphins.. scenes that was so visual in the book; didn't show the Bella vomiting blood before her transformation; we did not hear her thoughts and pain after she got Edwards's venom.... Lots of scenes different in this movie than the brilliant Breaking Dawn book; more so than any of the other previous Twilight movies made me wonder \\" where did that scene come from?\\".  I think all the leads did an incredible job with their rolls Kristen Stewart, Rob Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner were all brilliant as was Ashley Greene. The wedding was beautifully filmed; but outside versus inside like the book.  I think the film director and way the scenes were cut made the difference...didn't flow well like the other movies even though there were different directors in the first 3 installments.  In my opinion this movie had too many in-significant/ different scenes and omitted many important scenes in this movie versus the Breaking Dawn Book.  Hopefully Breaking Dawn Part 2 will be more true to the book.
0143034901|5.0|I haven't been this entrapped in a book since... well... i can't remember :-) Amazing book even though this is an English translation!
B00001OH1S|5.0|Very fast shipping!!! I'm impressed! :) And even better . . . I ordered a \\"used-like new\\" product and it was actually brand new. . . You can't beat that!! Two thumbs up!
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|First, I want to say that this watch is very impressive looking.  It's face is HUGE! My husband is not really tall (about 5'9\\" and it looks a little too big on him IMO.  Even though the face is large the smaller displays on the face may be hard to read)..it just seems kinda busy on the clock face.  The band is okay looking even though I would have preferred the finish to have been leather also (the inside is leather). We didn't fix the date on it because my husband couldn't even see the small window on it so its a day behind.  But overall its a nice watch especially if you're a big guy.
B005C9YZIW|4.0|This review is for the Six Disc, Special Edition Blu Ray set of Planet Earth.<br /><br />Excellent product, and this package includes not only the 'on location' behind the scenes videos, but also several bonus videos. Anyone considering buying this is most likely already familiar with the incredible episodes themselves. I have only a couple of gripes with the set.<br /><br />First, the menu navigation has not improved. It's not intuitive to watch just one episode. You can play all the episodes on the disc, but in order to play a single episode, you effectively have to go into the scene selection for that episode, then navigate to Chapter 1, and play from there. Also, on the DVD set, I'm pretty sure it would auto play the behind the scenes video for each episode after the credits rolled. On this set, you again need to navigate through the bonus features menu screens to find the on location short for the episode you just watched. Now, with a normal movie, this is fine, because most people will rarely watch these features. But since Planet Earth is episodic, and documentary style, it makes much more sense to pair each episode's companion mini-documentary together and auto play them instead of separating them by many menus.<br /><br />Second is the packaging. I am never a fan of the clever cardboard 'slide-in' cases. As dust and other foreign particles get in the cardboard slots, sliding the discs in and out of the tight space will likely begin to scratch the surface of the discs. Only thing to do is try to be careful.<br /><br />Aside from these two issues, the actual content is excellent, high-quality, and everything I was hoping for.
B006H06IJO|3.0|I was expecting this movie to be so much better than it was. It wasn't that funny nor was the story that great. Very disappointing imo.
B000PMG16U|1.0|How can you mess up Star Wars? Well, here's how; Make a fantastic trilogy, take a break, and then years later decide you want to tell everyone the back-story, but just pretend your audience are a bunch of retards! With the first prequel make people wonder what the hell did they just watch. Then with the second feature just really get in there and give it to them like a swift kick in the crotch! That's how you do it! That's how you mess up Star Wars!<br /><br />You think Blu-ray is really going to save these films? Please.....It's like shining a turd. Don't fool yourself with the SW branding. Leave it to this film (even on Blu-ray) to prove to you that watching SW can sometimes just be painful.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Just because its overly complex doesnt make it cool, but this movie is awesome! Awesome story, amazing characters and actors. Must see.
B00003CX5P|2.0|This is really a mediocre Star Wars film. You only want it to complete your collection. Even then consider sticking with just the original trilogy. Now that's Star Wars.
B006O5Y75Y|3.0|After a few friends recommended this movie to me and seeing how the CGI looked amazing I decided to rent it. I can honestly say Ill have no desire to EVER watch it again. Definitely better than the first movie but still not that great.
B005KJZDXK|4.0|I bought this album as I love Zooey Deschanel but had never heard \\"She & Him\\" before. I was THRILLED with the perchase. The songs are not ones that are overly used on albums and were sung beautifully. The only reason I didn't give this 5 Stars was there were no original songs, which I would have liked to see.
006029129X|5.0|Such a good book for kids, my daughter loves it. It's a classic and every family should own this book.
0307959856|5.0|A danger in writing a pastiche is that, in the wrong hands, the attempt renders the original work unrecognizable and the writer who attempts it an opportunist.  I am delighted to write such is not the case in Death Comes to Pemberley. I can only imagine the delight P.D. James felt as she crafted this delightful story.  At this stage in her impressive career, it seems as though she wrote a story just for the fun of it.  Both James fans, among whom I count myself for over twenty years, and Jane Austen fans, among whom I, again count myself, will not be disappointed in this book.  Readers not familiar with either author will enjoy a stand alone mystery, but will miss the extraordinary ability of Ms James to extend the lives of some of Ms Austen's most memorable characters in a way that does justice to each character and leads them toward a future that Ms. Austen could have envisioned and appreciated.  All of the personalities of Pride and Prejudice are resurrected by the adroit power of Ms James in such a way that this book could have been a sequel to the original.  Life has altered each of them as the years have past but in ways that are wholly consistent with what one could have imagined.  How Ms James must have delighted in reconstructing the style, syntax, and grammar of the 19 century.  Readers unfamiliar with Jane Austen's writings may have wondered about the exaggerated language.  Austen readers, however, are once again drawn into a comfortable world they thought they had left behind.  I do not wish to outline the story here, other writers will do that.  I must confess, however, that as I approached the denouement I had a fleeting \\"Oh my God!  This is going to be an Agatha Christie ending and ruin the whole effort.\\"  I should have known better and I apologize to the Baroness for my unfaithfulness.  True to her respect for her readers, she pulls the strings together that she has casually laid by throughout the novel and brings the mystery to a satisfying conclusion.  Only Jane Austen readers, however, will appreciate her brief inclusion at the end of the story of other Jane Austen characters from another novel in tidying up some loose ends.  P.D. James writes in the introduction of this book that Jane Austen might have written it better.  I don't think so: which is a tribute to both writers.on.

B005KELS6Q|4.0|When I bought my first Kindle, I also bought a case for around $30. I forget what brand it is, but it was coarse, hard to zip, and the Kindle barely fit inside. The Belkin Grip sleeve is cheaper, I love the soft material, and I have never had a hard time zipping or unzipping it. I got it in pink, and I was pleasantly surprised by the color. It isn't a loud and obnoxious pink, rather it is a muted coral pink. It also fits a Nook (although I strongly prefer the Kindle). This would be a great travel case, easy to pack and easy to carry.

0545265355|5.0|I finally succumbed to The Hunger Games trilogy. I found out that a high school in New Jersey had their entire 9-12 grade student body read The Hunger Games for their summer reading program, so I finally gave in. I flew through them-I honestly didn't want the trilogy to come to an end. And I'll admit that I didn't want to love them, but I did.<br /><br />There are certain books I steer clear of becuase everyone else is reading them. And these are technically young adult, which was another turn off initially. But The Hunger Games, other than being free of profanity and sex, didn't scream young adult read to me. The themes of death, love and grief were pretty heavy throughout the books.<br /><br />The books are set in the future, when the United States as we know it has collapsed. The new world, Panem, consists of 12 Districts (most of which are very poor) and a Capitol. Years ago, the Districts waged war against the Capitol and lost, so each year the Capitol hosts, \\"The Hunger Games,\\" a live, televised event to remind the Districts who is in charge. Each District is forced to host a lottery to choose one male and female teen or child, known as a tribute, to participate in the games, where the participants essentially battle to the death until just one competitor prevails. Katniss volunteers to represent District 12 when her younger sister Prim's name is called, and then Peeta, a boy she vaguely remembers from elementary school, is selected.<br /><br />Katniss is a tough and determined tomboy...she and her best friend Gale often sneak outside the District 12 fence to hunt for food for their families and the local black market (a skill that will come in handy in The Hunger Games).

0545265355|5.0|Interesting concept for a trilogy... I actually read the complete series because so many of my teenage clients were mesmerized by the books. As a school based therapist at a school for children with learning differences, I heartily recommend the series, particularly since it appeals to students who are often reluctant to read. The first book especially, seems to grab their interest and they have a hard time putting the book down.
0756405890|5.0|I've read very few books that make the rest of the books I own pale in comparison or that I finish and immediately want to read again. But The Name of the Wind was that good!<br /><br />The prologue alone almost gave me goosebumps. Then the story begins in the present with Kvothe, the main character, as an innkeeper at the Waystone Inn in Newarre. We quickly learn he's not an ordinary innkeeper and Newarre isn't in the world we know, when spider-demons are lurking on the outskirts of town and attack a local. Then we meet Chronicler, a well-known collector of stories, when he arrives in Newarre having followed a rumor into town about the infamous \\"Kvothe Kingkiller.\\" Chronicler, like many others, assumes that the story of Kvothe is a myth and that there's no man who doesn't bleed, learned a language in a day, is fearless, killed an angel, etc., or perhaps that Kvothe is real, but dead. But Chronicler not only finds Kvothe, he convinces him to tell his story.<br /><br />From here, most of The Name of the Wind is set in the past, as Kvothe tells the first part of his life story and his search for the name of the wind. Kvothe details his early childhood, his introduction to magic from Abenthy the arcanist, his quest to learn more about the legendary, evil Chandrian and his early years at the University. I can't say too much about his story without giving away key parts of the plot -- but once Kvothe starts his storytelling, you'll find it hard to put the book down.<br /><br />The world Rothfuss created feels so real and is so absorbing that you almost don't realize that you're reading fantasy. What's always held me back from the fantasy genre is the difficulty most authors have in creating an alternate world that means anything or feels at all \\"real.\\" But Rothfuss creates a world that's has just enough magic and mythical elements to be intriguing and just enough parallels to our world to relate to. And the characters, especially Kvothe, leap off the page. Kvothe's heroic...he's overcome so much in his youth and we see him grow as a character...but at the same time, there's an inclination here about his capacity for evil and it'll be interesting to see what the rest of this trilogy shows us.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind was leaps and bounds better than most books I've read in the past few years.c...he's overcome so much in his youth and we see him grow as a character...but at the same time, there's an inclination here about his capacity for evil and it'll be interesting to see what the rest of this trilogy shows us.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind was leaps and bounds better than most books I've read in the past few years.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Quite fun and has a good veriety of games that allows hours of enjoyment. I can't wait to see the future games are available upon unlocking.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|Yeah, I was very disappointed with this. Such a great premise ultimately wasted - in my opinion. If you're a fan of the Blair Witch type 'found/recovered' footage thing, this is for you. I was ok with it up to a point, but then it became irritating. A little of that goes a long ways but they went way past the jumpy blurry wrecked-edit threshold. On the plus side, it was a great recreation and the mood was definitely creepy. I got a sense, no matter how contrived, of what it might be like to be there under those conditions. As many other people have commented, don't bother with a Blu-ray version: it's a waste as virtually all of the footage has been so distressed, you'd only be seeing the distortion and flaws in a higher res.  If you're into Lunar conspiracies, I'd instead recommend the fantastic book by Jed Mucurio, 'Ascent.' Perhaps that'll be made into a movie someday. In the right hands it'd be brilliant.
B0028R3G5O|4.0|This budget 2-CD compilation from Australia is an almost perfect overview of Cyndi Lauper's career, and features practically every hit single, plus some album cuts you may not have thought about before.  The Pros:  1. The sound mastering seems pretty good to my amateur ears. Not sure what audiophiles would think, but I didn't really notice any issues.  2. A generous helping of 36 tracks. Disc 1 contains most of the hits. Every track from the US issue of [[ASIN:B00008PX8X The Essential Cyndi Lauper]] is here, and many more. This collection covers Cyndi's career from [[ASIN:B000051Y0G She's So Unusual]] to [[ASIN:B0000071IP Sisters Of Avalon]].  3. A few rarities are found here too - namely The World Is Stone, Hole In My Heart, and The Goonies 'R' Good Enough.  The Cons:  1. I think a few more tracks could have fit onto this collection - namely the singles \\"Ballad Of Cleo And Joe,\\" \\"Disco Inferno,\\" \\"Into The Nightlife,\\" \\"At Last,\\" \\"Shine,\\" and maybe one of the tracks from [[ASIN:B00452J5AU The Body Acoustic]], which would have truly made this a career-spanning retrospective, not to mention providing an additional rarity, since as far as I know, \\"Disco Inferno\\" has only been available on [[ASIN:B00000JSB8 CD single]] and the soundtrack to [[ASIN:B00000C2BU A Night At The Roxbury]]. This collection was released in 2009, but doesn't go past 1997, ignoring three (four if you count the Japanese release of [[ASIN:B0001N1OI8 Shine]]) studio albums between 1997 and 2009.  2. The insert contains no information on the songs whatsoever, and the biography isn't that well-written. Very minor quibble, this is a compilation from Sony's budget label, but I've definitely seen budget releases go the extra mile for their inserts.  3. This could be either a pro or a con, depending on how you look at it. Two almost-complete albums are included. \\"911\\" and \\"One Track Mind\\" are the only songs from [[ASIN:B0012GMWNO True Colors]] that aren't on here, and almost the entire [[ASIN:B0000026KU ANight To Remember]] album is presented in sequence on disc 2, with the exception of the intro, title track, \\"Insecurious,\\" and \\"I Drove All Night,\\" the latter of which is on disc 1. While these songs are all fantastic, these albums are still readily available - do we need two near complete albums taking up space that could have been filled by more singles and a few more rarities?  If you want a great overview of Cyndi's career, you'll be hard-pressed to find anything much better. Despite the fact that it ignores anything she did after 1997 and contains two almost-complete albums that are readily available, as opposed to making more room for singles and rarities, this collection still outdoes The Essential by a mile by giving you everything from that collection and more.

B003XQRZ7E|5.0|Being a music fan all my life it's nice to see 3 seperate people get together for one great sound!  What attracted me the most was Joe Bonamassa and his style of playing,Glenn Hughes and Jason Bonham I had'nt heard in awhile what a pleasant blend.Derek Sherinian adds alot to the full sound of this band.  They are very good to watch live(on one of the music channels,or the DVD that comes with theCD) if you have the chance! Very good purchase looking forward to more of their music.

0385534639|1.0|Ever since Harry Potter finished up there has been a spree of books that many many people love but that actually suck. (Hint: Twilight)<br /><br />Ok. I'm not all the way through the book yet but I had to stop to check if it'd ever get better than this and it looks like it's not from what I'm seeing.<br /><br />The girl character is pretty lifeless like a rag-doll and yet has this immense power to do awesome shiz. Her mother's dead, her father abuses her, and she just takes it. At first I was kinda hoping she was gonna be like that chic in Great Expectations, Estella, but that def didn't happen. It doesn't seem like she cares about anything really.<br /><br />The guy character acts like your average joe kinda. There is nothing special about him. And for some reason he turns out more normal despite being in an orphanage and then raised in isolation. He should be a super damaged weirdo (though at least he wasn't emo or something.) Anyway, we don't get to know either of the main characters well but that's the read I get on them.<br /><br />The plot sounds really cool but then ends up being worse than watching paint dry. The author really misses the opportunity for a lot of cool points. She sets up all this excuse for competition, aggression, and drama between the two main characters and instead they don't even care about the parameters of the story. They resolve any issues they have with each other (if any) by the middle so then it's all, ho hum after that.<br /><br />Since both main characters suck, you can pretty much tell how the romance went. >.&lt;; I feel bad for any guy who had to read this (I'm usually more inclined towards guy books so I'm really feeling their pain and lack of cajones atm.)<br /><br />Here is a related but better idea for this book. (I always think about how a book coulda been better.):<br /><br />Girl is raised by strict guardian, is raised with extreme discipline for her craft and turns into a brilliant but cold young adult (or a sexy manipulative bitch either is fine).<br />Guy is raised on the streets or something until he is picked up by a traveling circus and made a magician for the competition, having already developed street magic. He is quirky, brash, but very sincere or something.<br />The rivalry at first makes them totally hate each other and they go at it with fireworks and everything they've got. Then after that they fight dirty. Then after that some other crap goes down and they are stuck fighting on the same side for five seconds. Then they realize each other are really hot and get down with it (also realizing half the hate before was just tension). Then they realize their guardians suck balls for manipulating them. Then they tear it up. The End.<br /><br />PS: You know your grammar sucks when it makes me give a crap, cause normally I do NOT care. If a books fails my grammar tolerance test, it has just got to be driving most book worms nuts. Since when do chairs look like trapezes?? What the hell is magical air?? And what circus isn't only open at night? I've never seen a circus do shows during the day...until he is picked up by a traveling circus and made a magician for the competition, having already developed street magic.

B0015DROBO|4.0|I am obsessed with Lisbeth Salander's character.  She fascinates me more than I can say.  I agree with those who say that there are very slow parts of the book throughout the journalistic side of Mikael Blomkvist's story, but then I remember that Stieg Larsson himself played a part as a journalist at one time.  I expect that the few holes that there were throughout the book will be understood later in the trilogy.  Some claim that the relationship between Salander and Mikael was contrived.  I disagree.  When you've had life experiences that Lis has had, it's no surprise that she clings to the one man who is good natured and kind hearted to her without a \\"price\\" to pay.  Thought this book was incredible.  I was surprised multiple times throughout.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its not bad, but I wish it were easier to unlock games. They should have it so you can either buy the unlock or complete a certain amount and it unlocks.

0553801503|3.0|I've just finished \\"Feast\\" and it was a slog.  You get the feeling that all these characters are building up to some exciting climax but then it all fizzles.  At this moment I almost wish I hadn't loved the first three books so much.  What started promisingly is now only puttering along.  I am dismayed that I now have to suffer through the other half of book 4 before we can get anywhere near a climax.  At the rate the story progresses I'll be too old to truly appreciate what a rip roaring saga this could have been.

0807014273|5.0|The original purpose-filled motivational book and a timeless masterpiece.<br />Viktor Frankl was a Jewish neurologist, psychiatrist, and philosopher, whose work was interrupted by the advent of World War II.<br />There are two sections to the English edition of this book.  The first is an account of Viktor Frankl's experiences in four different concentration camps, (but often just referred to as Auschwitz).<br />As a psychiatrist, he objectively analyzes the motivation and behaviors of everyone in the camps; prisoners and captors alike.  Surprisingly, not all prisoners are \\"good\\", and not all captors are \\"bad\\".<br />The second half of this book explains Logotherapy, defined as healing through finding meaning.  It was dubbed the third Viennese school of psychotherapy.  Rather than Freud's pleasure principle or Adler's power principle, Logotherapy is based on the principle that finding a meaning in one's life is the most important and powerful force for all human beings.<br />\\"There is nothing in the world that can so much enable a person to overcome outer difficulties and inner troubles as the awareness of having a mission in life.\\"<br />Is it possible to find meaning in the camps?  Viktor claims meaning can be found in three ways; through love; through work or deeds; and through suffering.  This book proves his theories.<br />\\"Ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for.\\"<br />This is the best book I have ever read, and re-read.

B002RSDW80|5.0|I got this movie for my wife as she loved the Julia Child in France portion. It has a real feeling for the period and Meryl Streep is wonderful as always. Amy Adams is also terrific but her story line is not as well defined.
B0059XTUEK|5.0|I think this movie is amazing and Michelle Williams is absolutely fabulous and her portrayal of this Icon is absolutely breathtaking.. If you haven't seen this movie I suggest going to see it or when it comes out March 6th buy it or rent it it's absolutely amazing I'm in total awe the rest of the cast is just fantastic.. A+++
B004EPYZOO|5.0|The movie was on time and in very good condition. I will definitely be using them again. for a new company they are very impressive
B005ORVN1Y|2.0|I've read reviews saying how muffled other remasterings were. Do you folks not remember how the stuff sounded on vinyl. It had punch and power. That's the sound of rock music. It's not muffled. Turn it up and it comes alive. The '97 remasters deliver some of that. Fly By Night is representative of that. Exist Stage Left...also. Of the later releases Counter Parts and Test for Echo get it done. Signals is one of my favs also, but with the '97 remaster I had to do a remaster of my own with my CD recorder and my 7 band EQ to add some punch and power. Did that with 2112, Moving Picture and Grace Under Pressure. Now those shake the room like Fly By Night does. You get the point. This stuff about crisp, clean and clear has ruined countless remaster over the years. Sadly the Sector Sets are also a victim of the crisp and clear crap. Love the idea though. But don't leave out the punch and power!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this app because there is a wide variety of games. It keeps you entertained for a long car,train,bus,or plane ride. I would recommend this to you.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|This is actually a good little app. I have looked at several of these apps the past few weeks, and this is one of the better ones I've seen. Several people have complained that this doesn't do repeat tasks, but it does. You add the task, then you tap it to edit it, and there you can specify how you want the task to repeat.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is really fun and addicting. I don't have it on my kindle yet but I have played it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a game you can play that doesn't require hyperactive speed or too much brain power. a game to relax with.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|This movie was decent.  It was worth Amazon's 99 cent weekend sale price.  I didn't expect much with the Nordic god premise, but I generally approve of Marvel/superhero flicks, so I was willing to give this a try.  I really didn't have any expectations.  I am familiar with Kat Dennings and Natalie Portman, so I was overall looking forward to this movie.  And going in with no real expectations at all, I must say that I wasn't dissatisfied.  It was good enough.  It wasn't great or amazing, but it was entertaining.

B0063IH60K|5.0|It's a great game.  It is very easy to play and the graphics look good.  I would highly recommend it.
B003I55BIA|4.0|I found this story refreshing in a lot of ways. I liked that the author told two sides of this story, unearthing similarities between people who are so culturally and economically different. While the characterizations were prototypical and at times cliche, they offer deeper insight that other stories ignore.<br /><br />This story is slightly racier than others in the genre; however, I do not think it was done for shock value as much as to create the image of an authentic experience.<br /><br />I took issue with the epilogue and some of the obvious White vs. Hispanic cultural portrayals; however, the characters demonstrate a very real reflexivity.

0738727326|5.0|As the title says, I bought these gorgeous cards for creative writing. I must be clear that I do not read the cards for tarot purposes, and in fact, I have no knowledge of how to do this, and have only seen it done once, years ago now. So, I have no idea whether they are good, bad, or indifferent for tarot readings. I think they probably are good, based on the other reviewers, but I have no personal knowledge to that effect.   That said, I am very glad I bought these. I was looking for a set of cards to use to help me brainstorm with my fantasy writing. Cards like these can help with 'writer's block', plotting, character development, and so on. These are excellent for the purpose. The cards are just beautiful, richly detailed, and inspiring. I won't go into my 'method' for this, though I'd be happy to share it if someone wants to leave a comment here requesting me to do so.   There is a good balance of cards, by which I mean, they aren't all peace and joy, and they aren't all dark and frightening. That's good from the perspective of writing (though I like happy endings, myself, I can't let the characters get there unscathed, after all). While these lend themselves particularly well to a fantasy novel, short story, or poetry, I think you could make them work for anything fiction.   Like the other reviewers said, the cards are a tad smaller then they could have been (I wouldn't have noticed if the illustrations weren't so absorbing), but I wouldn't personally let that stop me from getting them. They are still worth every penny.   I hope this helps!
B004ECDNJU|3.0|I enjoyed this game.A dragon head spits out fire and you have to figure out the direction to send the fire. Sometimes is is tricky. It is nice way to pass time!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|What can you say about it that hasn't already been said?  The movie is great.  If you didn't like it, then you probably won't be reading this review anyway, and that's fair enough -- you won't be interested.  But if you DO like it, or love it, then you can't go far wrong here.  On blu-ray, Avatar is immensely impressive, with a wealth of detail picked out, and the extended version only adds a little extra to the movie.  It does feel somehow a shade more complete even than the original cinematic version, which was already excellent.<br /><br />I've not yet had time to browse through the special features, but there are two whole discs, and if you ever wanted to see what went on behind the scenes of making a movie, this would be on a level with The Matrix in terms of curiosity; the technical achievement alone is impressive, and I'm looking forward to seeing it.  But those features aren't why I'm recommending this set.  The movie is good enough to earn that on its own.
B001GCUO4S|4.0|The Final Destination series is really only about one simple formula: Guy/Girl has a premonition of a disaster, gets a bunch of his friends and some other people to safety, then the disaster happens and everyone dies except them. Cue Death, who steps in to finish the job, since those people were supposed to die then and didn't, and Death does not like that one bit. Death then goes around one-by-one and sets up catastrophic and hidden \\"accidents\\" for each person that survived.  Death is clearly a sadist, since he could just, like, give them an aneurism or something, but instead he tries much more painful and sadistic methods to get his work done. So here we are, at the fourth movie, after three films of a whole lot of teenagers dying in freak accidents. For those who want more, here you go.  Really, this one isn't exactly terrible and the death scenes do show a little originality, but the previous three really get the job done much better. Death #1, which, if I remember correctly, involves a tow truck and someone being set on fire, isn't all that great. There's very little suspense, as it all happens very quickly, and you never get that suspense you really want from the scenes in which you know someone's going to bite it somehow. The first death scene is a little over the top, and isn't constructed with much suspense. He's there, then he dies with a little help from Death, but not a lot. There's nothing special about the character himself, and the death is over quickly and isn't all that exciting.  The second one is a bit of a curveball, since the whole time you're expecting something else to kill the character, but then she randomly dies from something completely different. That \\"something\\" happens to be a goddamned stone, but whatever. It's not very good, particularly since the character in question dies immediately and without knowing what hit her. It kind of leaves you disappointed at how little the scene really adds up to.  Number three is probably the weakest in the whole series. It doesn't work on any level at all. I can stand a lack of realism for stuff like this, but only to a point, since it's pretty hard to die from being in a damned swimming pool. Somehow, the pressure when draining the pool is on the level of a singularity, and causes the character's intestines to be ripped from his...uh...underside. It's really stupid, honestly, and a total throwaway.  Then we've got the rest of them. Again, nothing special for any of them. Often, like the others, they're over far too quickly, with no room for suspense, and it's pretty clear they went for quantity over quality here. There are more deaths here than any other FD film, but they're also far shorter and less carefully constructed. One after another, they inevitably go down, until the final climax when the day is supposedly saved (everyone knows by now it never is and Death doesn't just give up because you're determined enough to avoid it--even Clear Rivers learned that the hard way, and she was voluntarily placed in a padded cell to keep herself safe, and she still ended up dying early), and then the remaining characters all die in a spectacular fashion. Really, the climax of this movie is the best part. It's big, explosive, violent, and exciting. It loses a few points for avoidably poor realism (one does not bleed out their mouth from having their foot crushed), but at least it's hectic, and then the ending was supposed to conclude the series...until they made a fifth one. But it still works.  This is probably the worst FD movie thanks to too many deaths with too little suspense involved in them. I've heard some people complain about the opening disaster, but I didn't have a problem with it, I just had a problem with everything after it.  So, let's check off the things that really matter to the majority of us!  Level of gore: 7/10. The stuff that's implied to be extra horrific is censored, but it's still bloody and gory. It gets the job done well enough.  Creativity in kills: 3/10. No good. Very little suspense, and it's nothing all that exciting. It gets a couple points for the kills at the very end with the main characters, which was nicely done...they die twice.  Character variety: 1/10. Yuck. Cardboard cutout stereotypes all around, with not one single person we should care about. Kind of a shame, really, considering the previous FDs had characters we gave a damn about. There isn't a single one here that is worth noting, though, including our main character, who is just a kid with no discernible traits worth mentioning. He's a generic good guy who has the premonition, and that's about all we care about from then on.  Overall satsisfaction: 6/10. Again, it's not awful, and at least the kills are gory, but the suspense is seriously missing. Final Destination 2 this certainly isn't. Some say FD 3 was the worst one, but I have to disagree. This one shows even less creativity.  Other problems: Sorry kids, no Tony Todd this time around. A real shame, since he's a staple of FD, and the one single recurring character up to this point. Even the one person who survives into the second film, Clear Rivers, ended up biting it in that one, to some people's dismay, as they wanted her to be a recurring character, too. I mean, if anyone could survive, she could...but no one can survive, so that's sort of a moot point. She went up against Death itself, for Christ's sake. How did she expect to win? But yeah, no Tony Todd. Lame.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I ran into the same update problem that many others had. After uninstalling the game and re-downloading it, I was able to log in and play. In spite of this MAJOR problem from Gameloft the game is great.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|It's been a while since I watched this flick and I figured now would be as good a time as any to revisit.  I won't get too wordy, because everyone and their mother knows this movie inside and out.  It was one of the most influential flicks when it was first released, especially in the terms of visual computer effects.  The effects still hold up, after all this time.  James Cameron, Stan Winston and the team of practical and visual effect folks on this movie are at the top of their game, delivering a movie that looks better than a lot of todays FX fests.   I'm one of the few that actually prefer the first one over this one.  To me, the original Terminator was scarier and creepier.  The thought of an unstoppable killing machine on your trail with the only human (yet very resourceful) Kyle Reese to protect you was a terrifying one.  It was more of sci-fi meets horror and it was extremely effective in what it set out to do.  The sequel is more of a blockbuster sci-fi action movie that does what it sets out to do just as effectively, so which one you prefer probably depends on what genre you prefer your Terminator in.  That said, Terminator 2: Judgement Day is still flat out full of awesome.  It does a lot of things right; you have Arnold at the very top of his game, Robert Patrick makes a very worthy opponent as the liquid metal T-1000.  The action is top notch and delivers the goods in very satisfying ways.  The major flaw I find in the film is that it suffers \\"Annoying Kid Syndrome.\\"  I understand that John Conner is an important part of the story and in fact what drives the story along.  But man does he come off as a whiny little brat.  Cameron has a little too much fun trying to make Conner the quintessential early 90s rebel teenager with all the outdated slang and annoying attitude that goes along with it.  Sorry, it just seems too self aware and corny, especially for this day and age.  That aside, I did like the relationship John developed with the Terminator, I felt that part of the story rang true.  A boy and his killer robot.  Like I said, though, I won't get too wordy, you already know if you like this movie or not.  The blu ray portion of the movie, I feel is kind of a mixed bag.  I've always like the blue-tinged look of the movie and it's about as sharp and crisp as I've ever seen it.  I'm currently in between surround sound systems at the moment, so it would have been nice to have a 2.0 audio option to help out with the sound on my TV.  I'll be honest, I don't have the ideal setup to fully take advantage of the Blu Ray experience, but I would imagine that the surround sound audio option is fantastic for those that have it.  For those with wireless internet turned on, the menu (while it does take a loooong time to load) becomes unsettling, as it takes on the persona of Skynet who is tracking your every move.  It's almost durn near convincing as I find myself looking over my shoulder now to see if Skynet is hovering behind me somewhere watching me type this out.  Of course, it's probably in my personal computer too.  Dang.  Anyways, I thought that was a nice touch to give it a feel of Terminator conspiracy.   The special features are where I feel a little cheated.  Now there are directors and crew commentaries, and that's always nice, but other than that, there's a few deleted scenes and promotional trailers for the film.  The regular DVD had a ton of special features and I love me some special features.  I will say that the Blu Ray Live portion of this DVD has the most stuff I've seen in my meager Blu Ray collection.  You can watch a nice 30 minute making of doc, another doc that takes you behind the scenes of the \\"extended version\\" of the movie with all the scenes put back in and whatnot.  There's some Japanese promotional trailer material and stuff of that sort.  It sort of makes up for the lack of special features and docs on the main disc, but it would have been nice to see a more current in depth look at the making of the movie with the people involved in the movie.  Despite the gripes, I enjoyed the Terminator 2: Skynet Edition Blu Ray immensely.  It's a fun action movie on a great format for that type of movie that you can find for an outstanding price at the moment.
B000S057X2|5.0|I remember when i was young and collecting Comic Books and enjoying the thrill of the hunt for them , the way they smelled and when some one (usually a Parent or relative) commented on them , they tried to hurt my feelings.  Well , in my own way i did not take it to heart , and kept on doing my search for them.  I used to travel with my two - wheeled bike at least 3 or 4 towns over , take part of the morning and the after noon just to travel to these stores to purchase them.  I might of been tired , but when i went into that store , i was invigorated and could not wait to take them home with me.  At that time , they were 12 cents each (or 8 for 96 cents plus tax) and again could not wait to start the whole journey over again next wk.  I say all this because Ghost Rider was always my favorite and i still love him (even more) than when i was a kid. This DVD set is wonderful with different box art and some features not included on other Ghost Rider DVDS.  Want to thank the seller and Best Wishes to them.  J Korotie
B006C1DH92|5.0|While this is pretty much Fruit Ninja plus, with the voice of Puss In Boots, it is a lot of fun and offers new activities to the typical Fruit Ninja game.  I love the Bandito Mode, which is a completely different take on standard Fruit Ninja.  In this mode you get three lives to work your way through several levels of very specific fruit slashing tasks.  Some of them are easy, while others are quite difficult.  I've never completely slashed up the massive passion fruit!  There are also different backdrops from the movie and slashing objects that you can acquire, which makes gameplay even more fun.  Highly recommended!
B0000793ZB|4.0|I first bought this way back in 1985 when it was originally released. It is one of the albums that I feel, perfectly exemplifies the spirit of the 1980s. I listened to this over and over and over on my car stereo! My girlfriend loved it too at the time. A lot of good memories from hearing this again. My favourite stand-out tracks are the title track,\\"Once Upon A Time\\"; \\"Alive And Kicking\\";\\"Everything She Said\\"; and \\"Wish You Were Here\\". Great tunes! The kind I never get tired of hearing. Simple Minds were definitely at the top of their game when they released this, one of the best releases of the 1980s as far as I'm concerned. I was able to see them in the spring of 1986 on the \\"Once Upon A Time\\" tour. They were excellent in concert and perfectly reproduced the songs in a live setting.

B0001FR3IQ|1.0|Silly, forgettable non-thriller of the dime-a-dozen potboiler variety, whose only redeeming attraction is the lovely face and give-it-all-ya-got acting of Halle Berry.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr.'s one-expression countenance and wooden acting was insufferable. Porcine Charles S. Dutton as Berry's husband should have gotten the casting director fired. The \\"surprise\\" villain at the end is as predictable as a drought in a parched desert.

1601251505|5.0|I have played all the D&D versions from D&D Basic, Expert, Companion, Master, Immortal to AD&D, 2ed, 3ed, 3.5, and 4e.  I firmly believe that 4e is neat, but way to WoWish and not enough core D&D.  It takes a lot from 3.5e, but what you fail to see is that it doesn't just build on it, but makes it what it should have been.  It takes a lot of the rules and basically simplifies them.  Like a previous poster said, it makes each character class level matter to the player.  It's makes it worthy of making a level because YOU always improve on something or get something new each level.  This book is really is what 3.5e SHOULD have been.<br />  Now for the balance issues people are bringing up.  If anyone remembers playing the old school D&D or AD&D..players well were NOT balanced and were not really meant to.  NOWHERE in any of the D&D books did it state classes would be balanced. Fighters starting were WAY more powerful than starting wizard or caster classes, save Clerics.  You got one spell (maybe two for the DAY) and well that is it and lets not even talk Hit Points, because a simple rock could knock out a wizard with a 1d4 HP lol.  So the point being is that wizards or even other casters would become more powerful as LONG as they survived to get to those upper levels..and yes with the powers casters wield they would actually become more powerful than their martial counter parts.  The point is casters start out weak and grow powerful, while melees start powerful and do get more powerful, but just like most RPG and MMOs it's about gear for melee classes and being able to resist spells or mind effects through gear.  While casters are ACTUALLY getting more powerful based on knowledge or arcane or divine powers ALONG with magical gear.  Also, why do we remember great warrior characters? Isn't always what stats say..it's about the personality behind the characters...how well they lead or stand by their beliefs.  Most warriors ARE the leaders of parties because they take the punishment that would drop casters in a heartbeat.<br />  This is not to say that martial classes are without a need.  Against very powerful foes a good warrior, paladin, monk, ranger etc is still extremely helpful and against magical or horribly destructive mundane traps or even to find out seedy information a good rogue is extremely useful.  Because even with all the power some casters wield it is still impossible to take on some tasks without a good warrior leading the charge or just like all D&D games require...to take on task with a good group of diverse individuals.  Furthermore, D&D was meant to go beyond the mechanics in that D&D was about building character like from a good novel and not just stats.  Which is what all great D&D games are about.punishment that would drop casters in a heartbeat.<br />  This is not to say that martial classes are without a need.

0374275637|1.0|I am not qualified to know if Dr Kahneman earned his nobel prize or not; however, as a work of didactic english prose, this book sucks.  The experiments are unconvincing; people are asked artificial questions in artificial settings, and Kahneman never really nails down the experments; he doesn't tie diff parts of the book together,   and,  I think, most of the book is work he did that isn't that orignal; only the last part about homo economicus and homo psychologist is really different.  He is also arrogant beyond belief; I mean, how many times do you have to tell your reader that you , or your coworkers, won a nobel prize ? a dozen ?  I guess I'm going overboard cause it is a case of the King has clothes, they are just as fancy as everyone makes them out to be  And the index is terrible, key terms are introduced, but not defined, and the index is not helpful
B000W745CU|5.0|This full-screen movie is exactly what I needed to complete the series.  It's just a DVD though; I am not going to eat it or sleep on it.  Unlike the other DVDs in the series, the plot was so-so, but the DVD itself is in great condition, and being an older movie, the price was definitely right ----- about $4 including shipping.  The seller was great, and as I said, I needed it to complete the series.

1440503257|5.0|My eldest niece is a HUGE Potter fan and was so excited to see this book when she visited for the holiday.<br /><br />Here is her review:<br />This is an awesome book. I love the whole look of it.<br /><br />The recipes seem very easy to follow and easy to make.<br /><br />It looks exactly how you would expect a Harry Potter Cookbook to look.<br /><br />I cannot wait to make Harry's First Birthday Cake and I am looking forward to hosting a Potter theme party for my friends over the summer.<br /><br />The only thing missing is a recipe I have been meaning to try since reading it. Butter Beer. Why wasn't this in there?<br /><br />I seriously wish there were pictures in here because I would have loved to see the recipes brought to life.<br /><br />Going to try Sweet Orange Marmalade (Orange, Sugar and Water) . Sounds easy.<br /><br />I love cooking and can't wait to try these recipes.<br /><br />Great gift for Potter fans or anyone who enjoys cooking.<br /><br />If my lovely Aunt doesn't hand this book over to me, she had better be getting it for my birthday this month.
193413712X|1.0|I just got this book as a Christmas gift... I read the cover &#34;Pulitzer Prize Winner&#34;  so I dove in.  But soon found I just was too bored to read it straight thru. I skipped ahead/around to find a few interesting parts.  He did create empathy for Howard (dying man George's father) and touching descriptions of his epileptic condition/seizures and the heartbreak/turmoil they caused his family...but how could George (who lay dying) know so much about his long lost father Howard & his second wife when he only met him once for a moment for Christmas in 1953? And Howard didn't share details of that wife (Megan) and her unconditional love for him  as compared to that of his first wife--George's mother Kathleen--who couldn't handle the fits anymore and was going to have him committed?  (I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler, because the plot really can't be spoiled as it's so disjointed.) Maybe I got confused and they had a father/son relationship later where somehow George learned all this so his deathbed flashbacks made sense?  I can't believe it was written by a Harvard English professor because 1) it violates that rule of story telling to &#34;show don't tell&#34; ... 2) he hardly uses any dialogue/quotation marks at all and 3) there are so many run on sentences and confusing time lines and holes in the action/growth of the characters. 4) And some gross descriptions that I found very unappealing (George's infirmaries caused his legs to feel wooden to his wife in bed--ugh.  TMI. Yet not enough I. i.e., How about more description of the men & their relationships w/ their wives and how/why they fell in love?  And if &#34;our hero&#34; George could build/rewire an entire house but &#34;hated/avoided exercise of any kind&#34;  that made him sound  lazy not an admirable character we were supposed to care about... (and in contradiction to the fact that building a house IS exercise  and that this was in the days before remote controls and before computers and jobs thatwere so sedentary. Living was harder back then so it's unlikely that a tinker could survive to old age if he avoided even walking short distances as the author describes. George's habits...it just didn't make sense and bugged me.  In English writing I was always told: Use action rather than passive verbs when you can, avoid overly long descriptions...and the flashback method is very difficult to pull off successfully w/out confusing your reader.  This book could've been SO much better if he'd just written it in chronological order. Instead it reminds me of the  dream sequences in musicals that, yes, can be danced beautifully and show off the talent of the actors/actresses/dancers...so I guess I can see why SOME &#34;literary minded&#34; readers might like the overly looooonnnnngg descriptions/prose in the way some appreciate the ballet in the dream sequence. But most of us get restless/annoyed at the break in the action and just want to get back to some dialogue and the story advance the plot.  This book reminds me of  literary achievements  that I hated that I had to read in college ( Wm. Faulkner's As I lay dying) which I  disliked because it was disjointed and depressing and about old people dying ... It's not that I have anything against old people (I'm one now)--but young love is usually much more interesting to read about. The author needs to make us _care_ about the old man he's writing about!  Ironic that Nicolas Sparks (so often dismissed as lightweight writer) DID make me care and cry with The Notebook which was written in a similar style...but Sparks had a gimmick (the Notebook/diary was being read by & to the old people) which made the flashback work for the reader (we loved those two old people! We WANTED her to remember!) I didn't feel  attached to George or Howard in the same way...yet this is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel?!  Update: I thought I was the only one who hated this book, I mentioned it to a friend and she said Tinkers? Yea, my book groupcalled it STINKERS. And I felt less alone in my opinon. To each his own, but with so many great books in the world, I'm sorry I wasted time on this one.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I purchased this because it was not expensive, and I liked the design. While it does its job, it does feel flimsy and a little on the cheap side. I also wish that the cover/case was larger so that the on/off switch was not quite so easy to accidentally hit.  Other than that, it works.

B005FVFWOI|5.0|This CD is not your usual remaster!  Alternate tracks from a classic album, excellent remixing and wonderful sound breathe new life into a timeless composition.  Liner notes are too small to read bur would frustratingly appear to add much to the CD.  If the liner notes and lyrics on alternate takes of songs were available to read for those without super human vision this would be perfect!

B005OSUKSA|5.0|Addition to my original review:  Last night, I attended our city's symphony orchestra featuring Beethoven's Violin Concerto.  Later I listened to my Legacy CD with David Garrett playing the concerto. It reminded of the astonishing power he conveys when he plays. What an amazing talent.<br /><br />I understood the release date of Legacy to be November 4th, but it turned out to be a European release date.  As I didn't wish to wait, I bought the album from amazon.de and it was well worth the rush.  David Garrett plays every piece with elegance and skill and with the passion we expect whenever he picks up his violin.  The Beethoven violin concerto and especially the Kreisler Praeludium & Allegro are beautiful and beautifully played.

B000FC2ROU|3.0|I thought it was an ok novel but if you read this one you have read most of his other novels. It seems he takes the same story and replaces the characters names and locations and he has a new novel. He is the Japanese version of Dan Brown. But if one wants to read a Haruki Murakami this is the one to choose in, my opinion it seems somewhat deeper and filled with symbolism.<br /><br />If you own a kindle do not buy this novel, instead I suggest downloading Calibre-Library and going to ebookee (.) com and downloading it. Calibre will do the rest.

0307279189|5.0|Although it is a running book, or better written a book about running, this is one of the greatest books I´ve read. It is fun, it is interesting, it is daring, and full of magical details, like the value of friendship, having a culturally open mind, respect, courage of doing or pursuing whatever it is you love, courage of loving those around you even when you cant communicate with them. It is thrilling, funny, serious sometimes.  And well, it truly portraits a deep respect for the Raramuri. Not many people have the opportunity to get to know them if even just a  bit, even less, having an opportunity to run and make friends with them. But even less people   have the guts to pull what the author did; wonder into la Sierra Madre Tarahumara and nobody might hear from you ever again...yet he not only ran an Ultra, but got personally enriched along the way.  My respect to Mcdougall from a Chihuahua local who has never had contact with the misterious Raramuri apart from fleeing flahses of them when they come to the city.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|\\"A thousand Years\\" is on repeat ever since I received this CD. The other songs are great also- especially Flightless Bird. Don't know why Bruno Mars is viewed or listened to more because Christina Perri's voice is authentic. Lovely song.

B005TQAI6G|1.0|I was at this concert and thought it was pretty amazing.  The DVD, however, is totally lackluster.  There is no reason why a good director/editor couldn't edit this show to be much more exciting and high-energy. Instead, Britney appears slow and disinterested in the entire performance. Also she looks like she is completely off in her lip-synching, which is ridiculous because even if she WASN'T lip-synching perfectly live, the editor should have been able to match her lips up to the audio track.

0446547654|5.0|Many wonderful moments and hope for a happy ending; another great love story from the best format love story writer of our time. A slightly different ending, not totally unexpected. I own them all and bought them from Amazon. These are the kinds of books you like to share or read again. or better yet, see the movie which is never quite as good as the book.
B001HN6922|5.0|Very pleased with the movie.  I had read that it wasn't as good as the first so I was prepared to be disappointed.  I WAS NOT.  Very good.  Lots of twists and turns.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This game is just a little to easy. Have played others that were a little more challenging, thats why I gave it a three.
1584282584|5.0|I really have enjoyed this book.  I have always been leery of using my speedlight attached to my camera.  I don't like the pinhole catchlights and it's ugly lighting.  But I really didn't know much about bouncing the light around.  I've been playing more and have really liked the results.  I'm not sure I want to try and pull this off anytime at a wedding but this book has given me a lot more confidence and made me not afraid of using flash onboard (I do a lot of OCF work too).  I need to figure out how to make the little black half snoot thingy he mentions though....
B005KMX866|5.0|chriss isaak recreats the 1950's era country/rockabilly  sounds of early sun records. i sometimes thought i had  an elvis presley CD playing. it is great.
B005J4TLN4|3.0|I thought the movie was good, but I got it or my daughter, who is a rabid horror movie fan. She likes it very much so it was on her christmas wish list.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I have been a fan of George R.R. Martin for several years now, and I think it would be accurate to label me a Martin \\"Fan Boy.\\"  I have read [[ASIN:0553386794 A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One]] four times, been active on message boards, followed his blog for years and practically pulled my hair out in frustration at reading countless posts about the New York Jets and [[ASIN:0765326159 Wild Cards I]] while waiting anxiously for [[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five]] to finally be released. At the news that HBO had picked up the rights to Thrones to adapt to a series, I couldn't have been more excited.  A 13 episode series, from a company like HBO, was fantastic news.  While you might presume that authors like Martin would love fans like me, we are a double edged (Dothrakian) sword.  Although we will eagerly consume everything Martin's world creates, that adoration also comes with an overwhelming amount of scrutiny, which authors and production companies can almost find it impossible to live up to (e.g, Tom Bombadil and the Scouring of the Shire from [[ASIN:B00552986K Lord of the Rings, The: The Fellowship of the Ring - Extended Edition]]). I followed the development of this series with other fans from the initial announcement until the final trailer.  Even though I saw those same type of demands and expectations from fans, I can say that HBO produced not only the closest adaptation of a book I have seen, but even managed to surpass Martin's original story in some aspects.<br /><br />Told over the course of ten one-hour episodes, HBO's Game of Thrones might seem at first glance to simply be a high fantasy adventure story, but it can more aptly be described as a political drama.  Taking place in an alternate medieval world, the series focuses more on the characters and their interactions with each other than on the adventure aspect.  Character development, and Martin's refusal to write a conventional story, ensure that the viewer is always kept on the edge of their seat. I remember finishing one of the first chapters of the book and sitting up in my bed in shock, thinking about what had just happened and trying to figure out how Martin could have done that.  I have no doubt that viewers of the first episode will feel the same way.  The acting, especially performances by Sean Bean (as Ned Stark) and Peter Dinklage (as Tyrion Lannister) is superb.  Production value on the show is nothing less than amazing and it looks more like a feature film than a cable series (especially the opening sequence).<br /><br />If I had to name any criticisms of the show, all I could say is that some of the acting, particularly Emilia Clarke (Daenerys) and Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark), was a little stiff.  I know Martin includes a lot of sex in his books, but it seemed like some of the scenes were designed a little more toward shock value.  Tyrion was not nearly ugly enough  (if at all).  I know that sounds like a nitpick, but I think it's important to his character to mirror the misshapen appearance in the books, to draw more attention to his wits.  And lastly, it can be very difficult for a new viewer to keep track of all the characters and families without a cheat sheet. Even after reading all of the books I still had to look some people up.<br /><br />The first season of Game of Thrones is amazing writing combined with above-average acting and amazing production design and direction. Not only is it everything fans could hope for in a series, but it helps to bring Martin's work to a new audience, who might be turned off at the idea of reading a long and complicated fantasy series. Producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have done an excellent job of faithfully transitioning Martin's work to the small screen while keeping fans happy and introducing millions of new fans to the Seven Kingdoms.that the viewer is always kept on the edge of their seat.

0545265355|2.0|The first book is ok, the remaining 2 go from ok to bad really fast.  The idea for the books is good, but the creativity stops there.  Also, I don't think this is teen/young adult fiction.  It is extremely gruesome and I would highly suggest parents think before allowing children to read these books.
B0063IH60K|4.0|for having a 200$ Kindle fire, this is what I do with it mostly. I would remove the option to only play a winning hand.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I don't know why everyone is saying these don't work on the kindle fire it so works on my kindle!
B000050FEN|5.0|I have to give this movie a 5 out of 5 because I find it to be one of the best films of the genre. I read a one star review complaining that there was no \\"catharsis\\" in the ending of the film. I would argue that there is catharsis, not just a very optimistic one. This is a dark thread of a view of society as a whole that is followed throughout the film. The acting by the primaries is great...Freeeman, Pitt, and Spacey. The production and cinematography are also 1st rate.  This particulr Platinum Seriers release is great with 4 different audio commentaries and 2nd disk with lots of suplimental material. Other lower ratings complained of having to flip the disk over to watch the whole movie or problems with the blue ray running on PS3. No problems here with particular device or quality. Spend the extra money and skip the Blue Ray version. So far this is the definitive release of this film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game game ever because you dont have to take up space with games because you can play all on one app.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|Would have returned the one that didn't work, but didn't keep receipt. my girls were so excited to each get one. One I bought from a local record store, and it worked, the one I bought online, no sound. SONIC screwdriver, yeah, sound is important! My daughter was so bummed out.
B0055SWM08|4.0|this game is really fun, I enjoy puzzles such as these and they are easy enough to complete but challenging enough to be interesting.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is beautifully written and was unable to put it down from the first page until the last.  Absolutely magically!
B00000I14Z|5.0|This is of course, an iconic jazz album. It was a gift for my dad and he loved it! Just in case anyone is wondering though, this edition does not have the famous vocals in Faubus Fables.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|The book was a pretty mediocre fiction book, and horribly written. Its' authors were as equally mediocre. Finally, the people that worship this book are fraudulent, hypocritical murderers that hide behind their governments in fake innocence.
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|The DVD arrived ahead of the due date and was indeed brand new.  This was bought as a gift and the recipient was delighted!!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|BEST GAME EVER MADE ON THE APP STORE! I have downloaded many maany games but none come close to being as good as cut the rope.
B0006AAS5G|3.0|This watch is huge!  Not only will I have to pay to get several links removed from the band, but even then this watch is heavy!  It is a nice looking watch, but a lot of useless features unless you use your watch as an analog stop watch.  The quality seems to be excellent, but not the type of watch I was expecting.  This is more sporty than dressy.  Im not sure I can even wear it with a suit, it looks like a watch for the gym, not the board room.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Really fun hide &amp; seek game with clues!  The only disappointing thing was the end.  Cannot wait for the next one!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am 40+ and this game can be addictive. LOL. I read other reviews and I have played this for hours. I haven't seen one ad as stated in other reviews????I have downloaded several of the FREE games...this is my favorite one so far.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Truly a fantastic device, not heavy at all even with a ps3 or Xbox in it! Video quality is amazing sounds great. Must buy for traveling gamers.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|Its a great app don't get me wrong but it needs some polishing. The biggest problem I have is that when I change how the app sorts out my tasks, and then I close the app and get back on again, the app does not save how I would like my tasks to be sorted and it goes back to the default sort. That is the biggest problem in my mind. Otherwise pretty decent app. Handy Apps, please stop this problem from happening!!!!!!
B005MYEPXC|1.0|I am having the same  problem with the DVD.....no sound in dialogue. I also have a Samsung player and I have not experienced any problems until I played this disc. This is the second copy I have gotten from Amazon and the 2nd copy is the same as the 1st copy...no dialogue. Samsung sent me a software disc to correct the problem and it is not fixed. I called them again yesterday and they said there is another software disc coming out that should hopefully correct the problem...WE WILL SEEE.
B0061S073A|5.0|Whenever my kids want to play with my Kindle Fire, I swtich to the Kids Place app to let them play.  I don't need to worry about them download or buy something online because they are locked in the Kids Place playing only the games or read the books I have selected for them.
B005I0DLXK|3.0|With some strong singles - it's probably worth $5, but I find the lyrics overly repetitive (yes I know this is a pop album).  Definitely a kinkier edge, most likely designed to play off her situation with Chris Brown.  I guess all pop singers need their 'dirty' phase and this is it for her.
0385335997|2.0|I wanted SO much to like this book!  I loved the fact that it was a romantic series - especially with historical influence - but by the time anything interesting happened, I just did not care anymore.  I would recommend reading this from the beginning if you suffer from insomnia.
B005XRU62C|5.0|She has the best live voice I have heard in a concert.  I heard her perform at the Greek Theatre at UC - Berkeley.  Simply amazing.  Her vocals are just as good live as on the album.  A true talent.  For $5 - a total steal.
B004LROUNG|3.0|This is not an edge of your seat thriller that you might expect from Grisham but it is a good story. [[ASIN:0385535139 The Litigators]]
B0058U0EEO|5.0|Melodic and chill - I love to play this while at work.  Very cool vibe music.  The cover doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me - it's not really 'getting it on music' - at least not for me. :)  Well worth $5.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is so much fun and it's addicting! once you start playing it wont want to put it down.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I love this game. the game is so classic and fun.  I had to take a road trip with my bratty little sister but I had this game and I was entertained all the way.  I let my little sister play for about 10 minutes and it got her to shut up for the whole length of the car ride.  I HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0062082353|5.0|i thought this book was outstanding...i'd put it right there at the top with ml's lone survivor...kinda interesting how this book mirrored hw' seal team six...what with all the product placement(please note that i'm not trying to to take anything away from ck's fantastic account here)...in short, this book's amazing and fun to read...
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I don't care fore it but I cant give it a bad rating because of my game preferences.  I think it has everything you could possibly want in a game of mahjong.  I reccomend it to mahjong lovers not haters.  respect the game!!!!!!!!!!
B000ZELISO|5.0|The package arrived quickly and in mint condition. It is another fantastic movie in the Harry Potter series! It's incredible how Daniel Radcliff has aged throughout the years right along with the characters in the novels.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|this game is fun yet very simple it seems like an version of some sort of older game.  it seems like something that would be on addicting games and most definatly on cool math.  it takes a lot of skill and coordination of with way the fire will have to go. it is a challenge but the time that it takes to do it fills in a space of boredom. highly recommend
1451627289|5.0|Many more people have written better reviews of this book than I can but I absolutely loved it. King's construction of the physics involved in time-travel is mind-bending. His imagining of what might have happened had JFK lived -- a worst-case scenario -- is genuinely horrible. But above everything is the love story between Jake and Sadie. The last scene is about as beautiful as anything I have ever read. Love this book!

1594203059|4.0|Niall Ferguson has written a readable macro view of what he believes are the six \\"killer apps\\" that allowed the west to dominate the world militarily, technologically, and culturally.  These six factors (competition, science, property, medicine, consumption, and work ethic) allowed a \\"backward\\" Western Europe, with its micro states backed up against the Atlantic, to expand across the oceans and rule the majority of the world.  Within each of the book's sections, Ferguson goes into detail on what made this factor unique to the west within a historical context, and why or why not other cultures could not or did not take advantage of, or develop, the factor.  Of course, given the broad nature of the subject and time covered (500 years), there's plenty of room for disagreement, especially on the details.  At the same time, it's probably impossible to identify all the variables that allowed the west to dominate, and it's not possible to measure the impact of one variable on the other - and none of these are independent variables. However, overall the book does bring a legitimate perspective to the subject, but should be read in conjunction with other studies on the same subject.
0439023521|5.0|I consider myself, unfortunately, a picky reader. I reluctantly yet desirably at the same time bought a Kindle. I had put off buying one and was reluctant for the mere fact that it is extremely (understated) difficult for me to find books to read. I had one friend, who had told me 6 months ago, that she was reading The Hunger Games and recommended for me. I thought, fine, it is only $5 for the Kindle book version, so even if I don't like it, it's not like it is a $25 book and a lot of money lost.   Quite honestly, I do not know why this book is so cheap for the excellent quality of it in itself. I found it a steal - I read this in who knows how many hours, but it only took a few days. I couldn't put it down. I had considered buying all three books from the get-go but thought I should wait until I finished the first book before I wasted my money. Let me tell you - I bought the second book no more than 50 pages into the first one. I had already decided that it would be worth it.  The story is definitely different, yet still enlightening and joyous of that of a young girl with mixed emotions as she expects the end of her life nearing. SPOILER ALERT: The only thing that I thought was written weirdly are the scenes between her and Peeta regarding the kissing and fake love in the beginning. I understand that to some point, because of the reasoning behind the affection, it should be awkward, but it seemed almost too awkward - I think it could have been written a bit different.  Other than that, like I said previously, I consider myself an extremely picky read, and this was by far one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure to read. I have told everyone in my life about it and have recommended it to everyone. I also recommend it to adults - the story is mature enough for adults to enjoy the read as well.  BTW: I cannot wait until the movie comes out. I am excited to see how it is portrayed.   But I must say, a lot of people are dissapointed by the movies that come out based on books because they pictured the characters differently in their minds. I watched the preview for the movie first for this book, that way, I used the actors in the movie when I pictured the characters while reading - that way, I won't be dissapointed by the casting choice,e tc.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a very fun app to play. I reccomend it. It is fun but the ads are annoying, but if you don't like them just get the paid version.
1423140591|5.0|Delivery was perfect, book was as advertised! And Rick wrote yet another great book in the series! Can't wait for the next one!
1451648537|4.0|Found the book fascinating! Granted it's tough to chronicle the life of such a complex individual but the interviews with Jobs are incredibly revealing. This book may not cover \\"everything\\" around how to be a great entrepreneur but I think it does a great job of covering key issues.  If you want to build a better life, personally and professionally there are books to help you - whether you are looking to pick a [new] career,  assess your strengths and weaknesses, etc. (For those topics, I recommend [[ASIN:0983797706 Igniting Your True Purpose and Passion: A Businesslike Guide to Fulfill Your Professional Goals and Personal Dreams]]) - it's a compelling autobiography, packed with sound advice from someone who has achieved tremendous success... Nevertheless, Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson was long but compelling.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|We bought this after watching the video of the Les Mis concert at Royal Albert Hall 10 years ago.  This is an incredible performance, using the best of the best and the performances are world class.  However, the use of the Jonas brother (he's OK, not great), showed me that they spotlighted performers based on their fame, not solely on their skill.  But, if you are a Les Mis fan,you're going to love this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its pretty awesome and it keeps me busy so yeah even my little sister has it and its her vgfavorite game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a great way to pass the time, and it's easy. I really like it, and the games are fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is wonderful!  Easy to operate and move through.  Great tool for word on the go.  This app is good for a study tool, helpful tool for reading the word throughout the year.  I also love the audible feature.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|this is kinda a not real quality I was surprised when it arrived I must say I expected more but oh well I asume Made in China  ...................
B0057UA4FY|5.0|I got this as a gift and they absolutely loved it!!!! :D  It was awesome and I would recommend it to anyone looking to buy!!
B003L77GGK|5.0|We started watching and got hook on this show from day one.<br />The story lines are good and effects are done very well,great combo and the<br />classic rock tunes that are played in the background are something we can relate to.<br />To many shows today are kind of corny or over the top,\\"This one is not\\" this one has it all.<br />Thanks,<br />Robert
B000W7JWUA|4.0|My son and daughter in law and I have played this almost every night while they have been visiting. Depending on your plan of attack the game is different every time.  There is just one complaint the outer pieces do not fit well.
B004QSQML8|5.0|This is one movie I feel that never was giving the credit that it should have gotten.<br />The effects are great and Tim curry as the Dark lord was just Awesome!!.<br />Anytime that I have told someone about this movie and has watch it says the same thing.<br />This one is a Classic for me.<br />Thanks,<br />Robert
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game easy to learn and play, great for the short line situation where you have enough time to get a few gamed in.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app and keeps track of my reading plans on multiple devices - iPhone and Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is great! so many little games to keep you occupied for hours! very fun! the only problem for me is that the rules for each game aren't openly displayed, of explained. you have to actively ask for help, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
B000CNFC76|5.0|This movie is great!  My family never gets tired of watching it. You don't even need to be a golfer to like it.  My mom didn't watch it for a long time because she doesn't like sports movies.  I finally got her to watch it and she LOVED it!<br />I have TVGuardian which filters out any bad language so I don't know the extent of it, but I don't think there is much to worry about.<br />This is not a \\"just about sports\\" movie. It's a true story about individual people, their families, and their fight to not be judged by their class and how much money they did or didn't have, but by who they were as people living in the early 1900s.<br />The thing that I like most about this movie, which you don't find in most sports movies, is the character's good morals and the fact that everyone close to the character doesn't measure his worth by whether he wins or not.  The story is very up lifting and touching at the same time.  My dad and I get a little choked up every time we watch it. Your family will really enjoy this film!
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|ELO has to be one of the most underrated bands that ever existed. Just got Out of the Blue on CD and I absolutely love it! We had this album on vinyl when I was a kid, I loved it then, I love it more now. It's just good, infectious, quality music that gets you in a good mood! Jeff Lynne got an Ivor Novello award in England with this album, and the songs Turn to Stone, Sweet Talkin' Woman, and Mr. Blue Sky were chart toppers on both sides of the pond. I don't consider myself an audiophile, the CD sounds great to me. Jeff Lynne wrote the songs for this album in less than a month, and when the album hit the market, it sold quickly and went platinum almost overnight. It's just brilliant, good music.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|Seems to be interesting but I cannot give it a good testing because it does not allow me to sign in with my corporate gmail account.  I'll check back later to see if they add that support.
0316056863|5.0|Loved this book a lot! It was very humorous and easy to read! I already love Tina Fey and this just made it even better! My friends want to borrow this book because it's so good. I recommend it to anyone that has a bit of free time and wants a laugh.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the user interface. It's fun and easy, even customizable! If you are looking to play an easy game of solitaire on a simple app, then look no further.
B004VQFQ2Q|3.0|If you guys want the best version of this album get the West German Vertigo non-remastered release from the 80s. It has the best sound (if you can call it that) that is available.
B00650SSWG|1.0|Gotta be the worst video stream on Amazon. And to think I switched from NetFlix for this? Regarding the movie content, it's what one would expect from Timberlake. Wish he could find some depth of character.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Like so many others, I bought this to be a cheap, yet high performing, replacement to my stock Intel CPU cooler. My i7 960 would oftentimes get into the red and this was without me every playing anything too CPU intensive. As soon as I mounted this new cooler/heat sink on, I noticed a 20 degree (Fahrenheit) drop and that was shocking. After applying 5 passes of Intel's \\"burn in\\" software, it never rose above 136 (again, Fahrenheit). With that said, I would, and do already, recommended this to ANYone who is seeking a cheap alternative to their stock CPU coolers. It's a pretty safe bet that you will love what you buy.
B004N70MH2|4.0|Every American should read this book! I really wanted a copy and this copy is in very good shape. Highly recommended!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Great movie from a great book.  The quality is breathtaking.  We don't usually purchase movies, but we're glad to own this one!
1451648537|4.0|Walter Isaacson isn't my favorite biographer, but he is easy to read and he chooses interesting personalities.  Steve Jobs is his best so far.  I really enjoyed this book.
1401307450|5.0|such a good book and a good look into the life of anthony kiedis. so happy with the book couldnt put it down.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible application is excellent. I have a kindle fire, and it loads very quickly, which is perfect for church and Bible study when you need to look up a specific verse. With all of the different versions included, it is far more versatile than even my own ESV copy. It is so much easier than lugging around 3/4 copies of the Bible! 5/5.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This app is pretty fantastic. It's far more accurate than the stock keyboard, even the Ice Cream Sandwich version... However the lack of customizability is really beginning to weigh it down. For example, my biggest gripe? The bottom row is unbelievably cramped,  and there's nothing I can possibly do about it! It makes for an incredibly tiny space bar,  meaning I hit the period or comma key on accident almost 50% of the time. It essentially ruins the whole experience. Also,  only 4 skins? What?   Please, fix these silly issues. All I'm asking for is a reasonable bottom row of keys. The dedicated (and useless) SwiftKey button, the question mark which no other keyboard has... Even other keyboards make the period and comma optional to adjust the space bar size. At this point the space bar is barely larger than a few normal keys.  Fix it.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|This game is the perfect touchscreen game. PQ2 takes the bejewed game-style and turns it into an RPG. You choose from multiple classes with different playstyles, level them up and do battle against all sorts of monsters who all fight you differently. Battles are played like bejeweled but with spells and weapons used from the jewels you match. I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME ENOUGH. Ive spent over 20 hours on this game and when I beat it I'm going to create another character and go again.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|game ok. get what you pay for! its free after all. needs better graphics. works on kindle fire ok. not bad.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I was first introduced to this game, by a friend of mine on his IPad. I was excited and happy to see that it was available for my KF when I bought back in November 2011. This is by far one of the best games available and it encompasses what tablet gaming is and should be all about.<br />It has a permanent spot on my VERY limited hard drive.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|First off I bought this cd because I am a die hard Metallica fan they are my favorite band and I check out everything they release. After lestening to this compilation a few times i will say this is not Metallica finest hour but its not that bad on the first listen nothing really stands out but I thnk you have to put songs such as \\"Iced Honey\\" and \\"The View\\" in consideration especialy the View that song has an excellent riff to it coming from the riff master James Hetfield! I think this cd captures some of the rawness that the album \\"St. Anger\\" has which I liked and alot of people hated but the thing I love about these guys is they are not afraid to experiment with different sounds and they dont care what the critcs say and they still satisfy their fans to the fullest. I think its pretty special for Metallica to want to do this kinda thing with a lefendary singer such as Lou Reed Metallica has alot of respect for musicians and singers before them which i think makes them a class act and a very talented bunch of musicians they are full of surprises no doubt. If you love Metallica as much as I do you will check this cd out and you may not like it just yet but you will appreciate it down the road dont write these guys off because they are icons and in my mind they are truly one of the greatest bands to ever walk the face of the planet. I'm very excited that these guys are very busy at the moment we have Lulu, Beyond Magnetic EP (Bonus tracks from Death Magnetic sessions)coming out soon on cd and their 10th studio album possibly coming out in 2012 to early 2013!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This series deserves more than five stars.  The set was beautifully done -- a perfect representation of Dicken's early 19th Century London. The acting was magnificent and the actors well chosen.  My husband enjoyed watching it every bit as much as I.  We had the misfortune to watch the Derek Jacobi \\"Little Dorrit\\" after watching this one and bailed within the first hour...it PALES in comparison! We need more of this sort of quality programming...again from the BBC...and let it be a sterling example for other program producers as to what a movie or series should be like. Thank you!

0312641893|5.0|Fairytales are supposed to have happy endings. And a Cinderella story is no exception.<br /><br />But when the heroine is a cyborg who would prefer to save herself rather than be rescued by a Prince, things get complicated.<br /><br />And when the Prince has more important things to worry about, like saving his country from a deadly plague and trying to forge an alliance with the leader of a cruel race of Lunar people, finding his Princess and falling in love seem trivial.<br /><br />With time quickly running out, finding a cure and deterring a powerful and evil Queen who has her sights set on the Prince seem much more important than happiness.<br /><br />So, unless there really is some kind of magic wand that can make all of it disappear, survival must win out over love.<br /><br />So much for happily ever after. But then again this is not your average Cinderella story.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Cinder is the instantly captivating, wonderfully imaginative and immensely entertaining first book in the Lunar Chronicles. This clever retelling of the classic Cinderella story is even more enchanting than the original, offering more twists and turns, thrills and excitement.<br /><br />It may start with a \\"once upon a time,\\" but this first book in the series won't stop at \\"happily ever after.\\"<br /><br />The fairytale will immediately draw readers in, but it is the charming, adorable and frightening new characters, the futuristic setting of New Beijing, the deadly threats in this new world, and all the fascinating changes and additions to this story that will keep readers utterly spellbound.<br /><br />This enchanting story is at once familiar and strange. Cinder is a mechanic. Forced to work to support her stepmother and stepsisters, only the youngest who is kindhearted, she is hoping one day to gain her freedom.<br /><br />Though freedom is not something so easily given to someone like her. Someone not entirely human. Cinder is a cyborg. Part human, part machine. Looked upon with disgust, she is not seen as an equal.<br /><br />But when she meets the Prince, he only sees the girl, not the machine. And for a brief moment, Cinder can dream of a better life.<br /><br />However, there are bigger problems in New Beijing. A plague that has been ravaging the planet has reached the city, attacking people close to Cinder and the Prince. And with the unsettling arrival of the Lunar Queen, there are far more important things to deal with than falling in love. Even if her not-entirely-human heart says otherwise.<br /><br />Author Marissa Meyer has completely transformed this classic story. While still recognizable, giving readers that feeling of familiarity, the author altered the characters, the setting and the world to make it feel new and different and a lot more danger-filled and suspenseful.<br /><br />By adding in the unexpected, giving the story a depth it didn't before have, and creating such memorable characters, the author has breathed new life into this fairytale story with a book that will leave readers anxiously awaiting the next installment.<br /><br />Cinder is a fast-paced, incredibly addictive start to this new series that is a must read for fans of strong heroines, handsome princes, evil stepmothers, wicked queens and for those who enjoy their fairytales with a twist.machine.

0553801473|4.0|This book happens about the same time period as Feast of Crows, only it has all the characters missed in feast. There is a lot of travel and more worldbuilding describing the Free Cities and the Rhoyne. Some of the characters make some pretty stupid mistakes and suffer for it. Some of the chapters annoyed me and I wanted to smack some sense into the characters but I'm sure martin will do that in Winds of Winter when the perverbial $&!# will hit the fan.Some new characters emerged and at first I wondered why but I enjoyed the hell out of this book as I'm addicted to Westeros. I'm listening to the chapters on audiobook every day and it seems I learn more and more with each day I listen. I love this world. Keep it coming George!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was lucky to get it through Amazon's daily free app.  But my phone's origial ROM on the EPIC didn't seem correctly specified for this game and would crash the phone phone after a few minutes of play.  Luckily amazon kept record of this game when I downloaded it the first time and allowed me to download it again once I put a new ROM(ERA EI22 BETA 4.0.1) on the phone.  After flashing this new ROM the phone was able to play this game almost flawlessly.  It times it will lag the game and even cause the phone to reset itself.  But the new ROM rarely ever allows the phone to crash so hard that I have to pull the battery to reset it.  It seems that the ROM will avoid that type of crash and do a soft reset instead.<br /><br />I have beaten the game twice and won all achievement awards as well.  My 9 year old beat the boss the first time around and really surprised me that he did.  He is very addicted to it as well  ; >  , some good leverage to get him to do his homework with minimum fuss ; p
B000V5SIFS|5.0|To start this I had read the reviews and this episode sounded like others in TNG and such but I found out it was quite different from any other episode i've seen so far.  So many emotional turning points until the very end of the episode.  Seems this is going to be one of the best episodes of the whole series.

0312641893|5.0|The new series The Lunar Chronicles has received a lot of hype the last couple of  months and after reading Cinder: Book One, I do have to agree with the hype. I cannot wait to see what happens in book two.  I was not able to put the book down.<br /><br />In this new twist on Cinderella, Cinder is a cyborg who wants to go to the ball but again her stepmother will not allow her to go. Cinder meets Prince Kai when he brings her an android to repair. There seems to be some sort of attaction but Cinder realizes if the Prince realizes she is a cyborg he will never like her. Prince Kai has other things to worry about such as Queen Levana of Lunar who would like an alliance with him through marriage.<br /><br />Cinder has a lot of anger and trust issues but it is understandable because of the way she has been treated. She also is very fuzzy about her background before becoming a cyborg.<br /><br />As I was reading the book, I was able to imagine the world of New Beijing. This is an action packed book with vivid characters. There were monents of predictably in the book and I think the reader may be able to figure out who Cinder really is. Even so, I recommended checking out Cinder. You won't be disappointed.
0345522478|5.0|I am absolutely delighted to find such a fun new author who has already published 3 novels. I will certainly be reading the next 2 immediately. Reminiscent of Ilona Andrews Magic series and Simon R Green's Nightside & Drood series. I wish I could find more Authors like Kevin Hearne (and a dog like Oberon).

0385341008|1.0|I'm going to keep this simple.  This book is terrible.  This book is written in form of letters going back and forth between a group of people, but yet, it sounded like one person wrote all the letters.  The book threw me off when I saw two authors, I figured it would be written in a way that the reader can see different writing styles. NOPE. Even the \\"simple folks\\" write like they were college professors. The story/plot is not bad.  But the way it's done is boring and it doesn't really have any character development. I mean, give me a reason to care at least.  If you take half the characters out, the book will still tell the same story and make it's point.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the reading plans and that it will remind you when to read. Need a Greek or Hebrew Bible, its in there!

Dave Grohl is such a performer and has an awesome engaging personality. And the rest of the band (Chris, Tyler, Nate) are all such talented musicians!  If you even like the Foo Fighters...definitely get this! :)

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Mr. King has shown in 11/22/63 that his best years are not in the distant past.  Well written, thoughtful and while bleak and dark in places it is tender and hopeful in others.<br /><br />Thank you Stephen - it was worth every penny.<br /><br />The closest thing I have to a criticism is that in the middle of the book there's a bit of a slog -  the stuff where the main character is studying Oswald.  But don't let that stop you from getting it.  You'll also note that if you look at my other reviews I don't give 5 stars for just anything and certainly not for all of King's work.  This deserves every one of those 5 stars!<br /><br />The real artistry comes in knowing how to end such a long story and that's where King proves to be a master of his craft.  I thought he'd missed it by not just leaving things a bit up in the air, but actually I found the last pages wonderful and elegant and sentimental.  Perhaps those aren't words that everyone associates with King, but there it is.<br /><br />Well done and timeless!

0618918248|5.0|This is a great book for the atheist and those that are about to abandon religion. I recommend this book also for the religious.
0670022411|3.0|This book has much to like and you can read about the plot, characters, mentions of science history and mythology, and great atmosphere in other reviews.  But it is an ambitious novel that needed much editing before its release.  The descriptions of tastes, smells and everyday activities can go on forever so I almost gave up on it the book during way-too-long passage about of the taste of very old wine.  I only kept going because I was listening to it on CD while on a trip.      This is the second book I've \\"read\\" recently that was released in what I consider to be a draft format - with a plot that needs to be tightened, uneven character development and descriptions that need to meet the delete button.  By rushing to publish instead of working with the author to shape and polish the work, I think the publisher deprived us of a much better book.  We can only hope that a good editor works with Deborah Harkness on the sequels.
B006G2NVCA|5.0|While it isn't quite Option 30's cover of \\"Der Kommissar\\", I've decided to review Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score for \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" anyway.     The temperature is lowered a hundred degrees the second we hear the hollow wind at the start of the album. It doesn't get much warmer. Yes, there's sunlight to contrast the icy, creeping dark, and, sometimes it serves to warm us, but, more often than not, it's cold sunlight, too far away to do more than hurt our eyes.     Practically every track has a wash of sound or some sort of distorted warble, sometimes they detract, like in \\"One Particular Moment\\", but, in almost every other case, it adds tension, distress and, most importantly, cold.   I've discovered how Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross managed to get such a desolate, cold feeling on the majority of this album: the use of instrumentation (the hammered dulcimer is simple, beautiful instrument, but they make it chilly and unnerving by doing something that sounds like hooking one up to an old modem receiving an error message) and scant vocals of Mariqueen Maandig, plus the keys and pitches at which things are played.  Most everything sounds just a little wrong.  Very alienating and cold.     David Fincher now has his very own Ghosts.        Disc 1     1. Immigrant Song - After the empty howling of the frozen North wind sweeps down upon you, the drums kick in, their surface crusted with ice that's shattered with each blow and yet reforms almost as fast as it's being destroyed. The vocals, like a frozen blade slash across your face and, just as you're certain you'll be lost forever under the huge, apocalyptic avalanche of ice and sound at the end, it's finished, you're finished...and the album, the thirty-nine track, two hour and fifty three minute score has just begun.    2. She Reminds Me Of You - There's something predatory about this. The wailing, lost moan speaks of things vast and beautiful and dangerous, like a moonlit plain, pocked with holescovered in snow, waiting to break your ankle and strand you there to die of exposure.  3. People Lie All The Time - A diseased thrum pervades this piece like blows sounding on a massive, stone door. The scrambling, wavering strings serve as a warning: don't open this door. A huge note at the end signifies that we're too late, the door was opened and everything is undone. There's a stunning sense of finality to this, even though it's only the third track on the album.   4. Pinned and Mounted - This track goes to a few different places; none of them places you'd want to go. A piping organ towards the end creeps up on you like something small and deadly, a psychotic child with a knife.  5. Perihelion - One of the most disturbing tracks on the album. It opens like a glowing, infected eye, spilling its poisoned light on fields of atrocities. Towards the end, when that rusted, metallic cry comes in and then the half digital, half demonic chattering madness...it's hard to keep listening, an aurora borealis over Hell. This is a strong argument for Trent and Atticus to score a horror movie.  6. What If We Could? - Could this be the only warm track on the entire album? The only piece that isn't comprised of icicles in the dark and shallow pools of gray water covered by particle-thin sheets of frost? For a moment, for this moment, everything's okay, everything's going to work out. There's hope. A sad hope, but that still counts. Then the light at the end of the tunnel turns red...  7. With The Flies - Some tracks on the album work when placed next to one another, but none as much as \\"What If We Could?\\" and \\"With The Flies\\", if only for the juxtaposition. The creeping terror inherent here is just so unsettling.  Both the title and the content indicate something horrible has taken place. This and \\"Perihelion\\" are both reminiscent of Akira Yamaoka's work on the Silent Hill video game series.  8. Hidden In Snow - The background is tar and the hammered dulcimer is insects trappedand dying on its surface. Listen to this on the right set of speakers and the pervasive bass will alter your brainwave patterns. There is a sickness here.    9. A Thousand Details - A bit reminiscent of \\"Driver Down\\" from the \\"Lost Highway\\" soundtrack, there's a wonderful sense of desperation, of pursuit taking place within this track. Feel that crunchy guitar. This one is all about disaster, explosions and the motherf***ing end of days.  10. One Particular Moment - Out of the wailing, teeth-gritting void comes some of the most beautiful piano on the album. Eventually, some simple, effective strings are added and the melody emerges from the cloud of dissonance like the sun on a cold day. Only for a moment though, before it's swallowed up by a huge wave of fuzzed out synth. At the very end though, if you listen closely, after the wave has receded, you can still hear the ghost of that melody, floating off into nothing.  11. I Can't Take It Anymore - Mariqueen's gauzy vocalizations add to the cold of an already frigid piece.  12. How Brittle The Bones - On a disc of dynamic, fluid, interesting tracks, this one stands out by not standing out. A simple, dull interlude.  13. Please Take Your Hand Away - This is both reassuring and unsettling. The big, slightly blurred piano offers solemnity and resolve, but everything else around it is jittery, unsure of itself. Something about those tumbling, falling notes at the end sound like giving up in a state of confusion. This is a great ending to the first act of Reznor and Ross' latest opus.      Disc 2     1. Cut Into Pieces - Brings you right back in. It's sharp and uncomfortable, more technological that anything we've seen so far. The ending is zombie crickets and cell phone interference   2. The Splinter - A lot like \\"How Brittle The Bones\\" as far as it's unimpressive.   3. An Itch - Everything happening in this track is great. The sound of sound itself tearing that pings back and forth, the paranoid pacing, the slightly detuned piano which runs throughout...one of the best tracks on the album.   4. Hypomania - Some thing is following you down a dark, wet tunnel. Something lumbering, inexorable. You run because you're terrified, but it doesn't have to because there's only one exit and it's standing between you and it. At the end of the piece, you face a bricked-over doorway and feel hot breath on your neck...  5. Under The Midnight Sun - Something broken stumbling across vast, empty, freezing tundra. You can actually feel the wind when you listen to this. The end is pure Silent Hill, as the limping thing returns to its lair and dies.   6. Aphelion - This begins with the sounds of space rushing at you, but not empty space. There's something there, waiting. Then a small, insistent melody. Delicate. Too delicate for a place like this. Suddenly, the space is shut out and you're confronted with the melody, but just for a moment. There's a music box buried under ashes somewhere in the wasteland...  7. You're Here - A juxtaposition of high, fragile sounds and a heavy, thudding bass beat. There isn't enough development for this to become interesting.  8. The Same As The Others - The high, lonely squeal off to the right combined with the deep, cavernous rumbling is pure Yamaoka. The melody has a ponderous, lost feel to it, also very Silent Hill.  9. A Pause For Reflection - The skittering, sparkling, dancing hammered dulcimer (like light) is given form by the simply thudding and depth by the roaring ocean in the background. When that glacial background comes forward and the rest recedes, something interesting happens. This is a track that goes from small to large, shallow to deep; like a body of water. A body of water under a sheet of ice.  10. While Waiting - Mariqueen Maandig's voice works wonderfully paired up with the bells on this. The track is short, but it accomplishes what it sets out to accomplish: it tells of the deep, rising, of something under the sun-dappled surface of the water, something old, something hungry.   11. The Seconds Drag - One of the most straightforward and literal tracks on the album. A clock ticks as, well, the seconds drag. More percussive than most. Eventually, there's some light programming that weaves into the ticking, but, in the end, the title says it all.  12. Later Into The Night - Plodding and deliberate. The use of a simple, repeated melody really you to feel the passage of time. There's a sense of maybe you're closer to the machinery than you should be. Broken jack-in-the-box. All this, but it feels a bit thin, like something's missing.   13. Parallel Timeline With Alternate Outcome - The name is more interesting than the music, but just barely. One of the most varied tracks on the album, starting and ending in totally different places. It's restful at first, warm, everything bad is happening on the outside, in the cold. This is like walking through a forest, beautiful yet eerie, then finding a body...first a cloud of flies, then a bloodstained shoe, then a second shoe with a foot still inside it... then a whole pile of bodies. The end guitar is f***ing terrifying. Another great end to an act.     Disc 3     1. Another Way Of Caring - This is a rape carnival. Plinking, wandering notes taken right from a child's nightmare meander throughout this along with big, disharmonious strings and creepy, out of tune piano, scaring the s*** out of anyone happening by. Welcome to the final act/disc...we're having some problems.    2. A Viable Construct - More tech sounding than most of what we've heard thus far. Somehow feels reminiscent of `The Terminator'...  3. Revealed In The Thaw - The last patch of warmth on a very cold, very bleak journey. We're not quite safe yet. Maybe we've found a place to catch our breath, but that incessant thudding let's us know it isn't over yet, there's still something outside...and we'll have to face it before all this is over/   4. Millennia - The passage of time as see from a great height.  5. We Could Wait Forever - Another tech-heavy track, one with a lot of error messages. One can envision a large, rubbery tube leading into a room full of malfunctioning mainframes. Perhaps there was a Freon leak, because everything is tinted blue.   6. Oraculum - Does Industrial Bhangra make sense? This is the most energetic (and longest) track on the album and is so disparate from anything else...I have no idea where it's coming from or where it's going...but I'm willing to bet they serve couscous there. One can almost dance to this, if there tried hard enough.  7. Great Bird Of Prey - After the most energetic track, we now have the most literal. One can actually hear majestic, deadly birds circling high in the air... And just as things start to sound like they're getting typical around the end...the track explodes.  8. The Heretics - Yet another techy track on a disc full of techy tracks. I can't help but think of \\"Ringfinger\\" when I hear this. This would be the most interesting piece on someone else's project, but on this album, among the others jewels found here, it's merely good. You can really feel the space that Reznor and Ross talked about in this track.  9. A Pair Of Doves - Just as airy and graceful as the title denotes...but short. An interlude almost.  10. Infiltrator - Here's another electronic track. There's a great, loose bolt sound in this. It creates a sense of \\"if we keep going at this speed, something is going to fall apart\\".   11. The Sound Of Forgetting - The sound of someone slamming a tool against the obdurate past. The sound of forgetting, not forgiving. The high notes alleviate some of the guilt and pain, but nothing can erase it.  12. Of Secrets - To end the album, which is comprised mostly of odd, obsolete, frozen instruments, there's hardly any instrumentation at all, just a rising and falling of static; building to a climax, then pulling back, like a frozen sea, only to rise and rise and rise until...nothing. A simple and amazing ending to one of the most incredible sonic sojourns you'll ever take.  13. Is Your Love Strong Enough? - A coda.

1423107233|5.0|I asked for The Archive Series: Story for Christmas, and to my delight it appeared under the tree.  As an aspiring animator, I am fascinated by the storytelling processes of the professionals, and the material featured in the book was inspiring (especially the Glen Keane gems).<br /><br />The book includes a board for one scene per hand-drawn Disney classic, all the way up to Lilo & Stitch (2002).  In many cases, different many artists were responsible for certain panels of a scene, as the boards are compiled from multiple stages of production to generally parallel the final film version.  The artists are accredited in an alphabetical film index at the end of the book.<br /><br />Even without sophisticated animation knowledge or artistic sensibility, The Archive Series: Story is more than just a glorified picture book.  Anyone can enjoy perusing the panels that follow a scrubbing Cinderella and holding the book next to the film to pick out the similarities.  Pure character overflows out of the original drawings; their personality is so rich, they will challenge the classic \\"I can't even draw a stick man\\" mentality.  The artist within is anxious to be unlocked by the key that is The Archive Series: Story.
B005FITIF0|5.0|I feel very fortunate to be one of the few people who was able to see Machine Gun Preacher in the theater, since it was not shown in very many places!! (For some UNEXPLAINED reason!?!)  It was an EXCELLENT movie........very moving, POWERFUL, thought-provoking, and well-acted by everyone.....especially Gerard Butler!  He absolutely nailed the character of Sam Childers.  He was not a very likeable person in the beginning, as he was just plain no-good....into drugs, crime, etc.  After a missionary trip to Africa, his whole focus changed into wanting to save the children from the LRA. It was an AMAZING transformation and one that really should be shared.  Although it does have parts that are sad to watch, it IS based on a true story and it does make people aware of the unimaginable atrocities that still occur around the world! I can't wait until it comes out on DVD so that I can watch it again!!
B000000H57|5.0|There is nothing else to be said.  I can play this album front to end and then back again with no hesitation.  I've read many of the other comments and can't agree more with what everyone said.  I could talk forever and give reasons why I love this band so much but there is no need.  Buy, listen to it and feel the words...you'll understand immediately was TON fans are so passionate.

It works great on my Droid X and I love the level of interaction (highlight and make notes, connect to your free youversion account and it will work across many platforms).<br /><br />I also love that there are so many versions of the Bible available for download, so you are likely to find a Bible that really speaks in your language.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|This movie certainly reveals the behavior of the French during the German occupation of WWII. As many will already know, many Jews were betrayed and sent into the hell of the extermination camps by the French and many other nationalities during WWII. This is the story of one group, those who helped, those who betrayed. The Holocaust theme has been well-done in numerous movies. This represents yet another remarkable testament to the powers of evil and good in a dreadful situation.<br /><br />The story of a young girl, and her struggles through the Holocaust, with a dreadful added twist. The story is presented in an interesting manner using a modern, parallel storyline. All revolves around an apartment in Paris. The movie is quite intense, not recommended for younger viewers. But, this is a gripping tale and I highly recommend the watching of this movie.

Ishmael Beah is awesome!
0545265355|5.0|at last! a complete trilogy edition set! what i don't like sometimes on trilogies, is the fact that they are so good that they kinda keeps you hanging, which for me is the downfall, but if you have a complete edition like this then there wouldn't be any problem..
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I just received my Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover! I love it! First off, I thought the white may be a little cheap looking but I was wrong... I love the look. The strap seems durable and it was very easy to put the Kindle in!
1846144841|4.0|I'm confused--what is the difference between this \\"Boomerang\\" and the other listed here (one has has subtitle \\"travels to the third world\\" and the other \\"financial tourist..or something). I've read all the negative reviews (especially on the other book), and I can understand why someone who had read most of the text in a magazine would be upset. For those of us who haven't, it was a refreshing take on why things have gone so screwy in the financial realm. Like many, he partly puts the blame on the teachings of Milton Friedman, but his main point is to find out what drives humans of various stripes to get themselves into such predicaments. Some reviewers here find he is being condescending, but I see his irreverent portrayals as something like a political cartoon--they are funny precisely because there is a hunk of truth to them.  I live in Europe and I love the Greeks, and I didn't get upset with his portrayal of them. In fact, I think he is pretty good at narrowing in on the \\"Zeitgeist\\" in just about every story, however crudely delivered. What I missed in the book was a comman denominator, a final treatise that tied the various chapters together.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great Solitaire game for the Kindle Fire!!! I really enjoy playing it!!! Love the card shuffling sounds &amp; the fluid handling of the cards. You won't be disappointed!!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a great cover. It is thin and light so it doesn't add to the weight or bulk of my Kindle. The stand feature works well. Would definitely recommend this cover.
B004ZQBP3Q|5.0|I learned about LMFAO and listened to their songs.  Wow!  I'm a rock and roll fan, but I've changed my mind after listening to LMFAO.  I'm also learning how to shuffle.  This album is fantastic.  I'm going to get the next one.  Amazon.com also rocks because I trust the security when I order from them.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun but no instructions so some games were a little hard to figure out. overall I find it great so far but it coould definetly be better
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I struggle to find time to read the Bible between grad work, regular work, and life. I have found this app to make it easier to find the time! I have it read to me while I am getting ready in the morning and during lunch I am able to read some plans with ease.

B004SJ3BCI|1.0|it has been a while since i played angry birds but this is ridiculous. it is polluted with so many ads its not even fun. as if they aren't making enough money with all the toys and other marketing schemes they have, they could have at least cut back on some of the ads. there are alot!!!

B000UBMWG4|5.0|This is a great edition and I had no problem with the discs number 1 and 3, as other people had. Now, my problem was that I wanted to buy the Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition on Blu-ray, which is really expensive. I though that this was a lot of money, specially with all the problems that other buyers have reported on the Blu-Ray edition. So, what did I do? I bought the Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition (Blu-ray) and the Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition on HD DVD.  They together cost me almost the HALF than the Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition on Blu-ray. Even cheaper than the same edition on DVD. I think this is ridiculous but, I got what I wanted whit a much more affordable price. Anyway, the quality of the blu ray edition is amazing
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Fast reader! Seamlessly synge with Google Reader and easily switches between reader and web view. I would pay for this app.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|i found this the best of the series... but that doesn't mean it was good. i gave 3 stars because it was the best of them...  how can bella become pregnant if edward is dead? made no sense...
B0063IH60K|3.0|I thought the graphics were a bit limited, as were the options. I have another free solitaire app where the graphics look better, and it has a very large number of games available.<br />  I can see where Iphone users would like this,  but honestly it is a bit limited and cheesy looking for an Android app.<br />  Samsung Exhibit 4G.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|Wont run on my MyTouch 4G.  Worth a try if it is free, but think twice if paying $ for it.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Cinder<br /><br />My First Impression...<br /><br />Uncertainty...will it be about weird robots?<br /><br />Retelling...rather tired of retellings...<br /><br />Fairy tale...heard variations of this one too many times...<br /><br />Upon completion of Cinder...<br /><br />In a tiny nutshell...Cinders is not human, she has parts and pieces that are cyborg.<br />She has been orphaned and lives with a guardian who treats her like a servant and isn't really that fond of her.  Her world is one of Hovercrafts and ID chips and is plagued literally by a plague that is wiping out the people of her nation.<br />Oh...I almost forgot the best parts...a handsome Prince who is interested in Cinder and an evil Lunar Queen who is interested in Cinder, too...but not in a good way.<br /><br />And although there are tons of wonderful people and cyborgs and robotic creatures in this book...it's a toss up as to whom is more evil...the Lunar Queen or Cinder's guardian,  Adri.<br /><br />There is a dramatic conclusion...at the ball, of course...a frightful secret revealed to Cinder...and she is given an immense choice to make.<br /><br />Loved it...I did not find it to be slow or geared to a much younger audience.<br />From the start I was fascinated with Cinder and her strength and resilience.<br />She did not seem overly predictable and I actually loved the way the pieces of her story...her life...sort of gave little hints as to her true identity.<br /><br />This is an exciting book...one of four, I believe and by the way this book concluded...the next book will be even more exciting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it! Very fun and easy to use. The games are all different so you're 100% sure to find one you're in love with. definitely something you want to get.

0307891372|5.0|This guide it's absolutely AWESOME... i can't believe the care they put on this master work. I mean it, this guide it's an   essential tool if you really want explore every corner of Skyrim's world... I bought the paperback edition, i'm not regret   of that, but i didn't expect this quality of content, and now, i wish ordered the hardcover edition instead.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is great! just when you get the hang of it and you decide your bored, a whole new aspect is introduced and you feel obligated to master it.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|There are many negative reviews regarding this product.  I must say there was no problem at all getting my Kindle Fire to fit!  The elastic streched enough for more than easy \\"installation\\" of my Fire.  Great Product!  There is a slight \\"smell\\"  but am not worried at all that this will fade with use.
B002ZE85YW|5.0|I have been hooked on the Terminator series since the 1st and this one did not disappoint at all.  Special effects and the acting were excellent!  Christain Bale never lets me down - he has become one of my favorite actors ever since American Psycho.
B000QUUD60|5.0|Exceptional product especially considering it has added footage not available in the original.  Elvis seemed to have so much fun working.
0446691437|4.0|This book is helpful in an original, quirky kind of way. I can identify with many of the author's 'resistant' issues but I need to do further exploration into finding the satisfaction of a muse. I long to experience the spiritual certainty of persistence.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|It's been a long time since I read a truly heart wrenching book.  I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B00511PTWM|3.0|The dual-port swivel adapter is okay. I have had to readjust it a few times because it stopped supplying power to my devices. That is the only reason I did not give it a four star rating.  The frustration-free packaging is great.
0307949486|3.0|The book was a good read.  It took a while to pick up, but once it did the plot kept me thoroughly engrossed.  However, there's an annoying amount of sexuality in it.  at one point the main character is sleeping with three women on a casual basis...and they just happen to know about each other, are fine with it, and in some cases get along with each other.  Right...<br />Like my title states, for this reason it often felt like I was reading the author's sexual fantasies.  It was an annoying distraction from an otherwise good read.
8862937148|1.0|I cannot believe that I am still waiting for this item to arrive.  I ordered this item before New Years.  At the point of submitting this order there were plenty in stock. 1-week later I found out that the item was then out of stock and have been waiting patiently for it to arrive ever since.  This is not the way to do business.  DO NOT ORDER from these people.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|An excellent dvd, with one of the best voices in the world. Excelent sound, and excelent image.  The perfect gift for a girlfriend!
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|Here's Real Steel in a nutshell. Remember that old board game called Rock Em' Sock 'Em Robots? Well now it's a movie. I mean the old game was just two robots fighting it out in a boxing ring. That's Real Steel. Rocky with hydraulic fluid. Your average underdog story. Add a love interest tired of her beau staying the underdog and a dysfunctional father/son relationship and you pretty much hit all the standard marks for an average plot line. I know that's what I thought when I was hearing about the movie. However when I saw the trailers something about it told me this was going to be a really fun movie to watch. Sure enough it was.  So Real Steel is essentially the same, tired old story told that has been spun in Hollywood over and over again, but with robots. Sounds mediocre, huh? Unoriginal plot points is actually the norm these days. Only Real Steel hits these marks with such gusto and polish that it really stands out in that rat race. It's not a masterpiece of script and story, mind you. But then again that's not the intent. This is a feel good, popcorn movie through and through. It's good to see one that at least takes its audience seriously enough to make a well thought out escape.  Lets start off with our main character Charlie (Hugh Jackman). To put it simply he is a jerk for better half of the movie. I mean the kind of jerk you just simply cannot like. Eventually the jerk gets a clue and starts to become the kind of guy you can't help but root for. This takes take a well written script and a talented actor to make the jerk and his eventual turnaround believable. You gotta give Jackman credit for his portrayal of Charlie. It's a character with a lot of heart, even when you hate him.  Next character of focus is Charlie's estranged son Max (Dakota Goyo). As kid actors go we have a winner. Enough teen indignant defiance to carry the family feuding and enough big eyed wonder of a child to carry the story. From there you have a very good ensemble of supporting actors. Again good, solid acting with very few boughs of melodrama (most of which just feels like it was needed).  Since this is a movie about fighting robots the \\"real\\" stars have to be just as good as the live actors. The robots in the film all come in a wide variety of designs and demeanor. More so the designs also give off a lot of character. The starring robot, Atom, has just enough characteristics to make him the likeable robot with stuff like rounded features on the face and glowing blue 'eyes'. It's not just with the look of the robot that keep you interested, which can range from junkyard mean to dark and polished shiny monsters, but also with other qualities like poise and stance, how they walk, even how they fight. The production used motion capture technology used in the movie Avatar and had boxing star Suger-Ray Leonard advise in the fight scenes. Again the results show a refinement in design and execution that makes the whole experience with the 'bot feel more real and organic.  The story flows with good pacing. It's not all fights all the time, and the off-time is worth watching. The underdog success story at first feels like it stays in the under part for a while, but then again that's part of the charm as you see just how much Charlie screws up his life. When we are full on in the big leagues is where all the previous stuff really pays off with the big exciting fight and all that feel-good emotions you would be used to by now on movies like this. The only segment in Real Steel that I have a gripe about is the middle when they start the transition from underdog to rising star. There simply isn't any significant robots fights in between. We don't really see Atom build up his reputation with any additional matches. This is a shame because the movie is really at its best showing these fights. You don't even get a decent fight montage. Still that's my only gripe for an otherwise very entertaining movie.  The Blu-Ray release will of course be in 1080p and have a DTS-HD 7.1 Master Audio soundtrack. DVD will have Dolby Digital 2.0. Both the DVD and Blu-Ray are announced with a host of features with the Blu-Ray rounding out some nice extra features. Here are the list list of extras (* denotes Blu-Ray exclusive):  Audio Commentary With Director Shawn Levy*  Countdown to the Fight: The Charlie Kenton Story* - An ESPN-esque expose set right before Atom's big fight with the champ. It covers Charlie's boxing career with interviews with key characters in the film. It also talk about Atom from a sports commentator perspective. Pretty neat little featurette.  Sugar Ray Leonard: Cornerman's Champ* - Really cool featurette on Sugar Ray and his involvement with the movie. Hearing him talk in the interviews and hearing how the producers and actors take to his direction gives me a renewed level of respect for the boxing champ. Probably the most feel-good extra in the bunch.  Making of Metal Valley - Behind the scenes of the what it took to create the robot junk yard as well as the development of the biggest stunt in the movie in said junkyard.  Building the Bots - Interest, if short, making of documentary on the robots. Most of the 'bots were built as well as computer generated and there is a lot of talk about the virtues of using practical effects. Only problem is you don't see enough of the practical effects in action on this feature.  Deleted and extended scenes - One of each. There is a slightly extended scene with Charlie's first robot Ambush that has more stuff with the kids. I can see why they took most of the stuff out, but there is a second of footage here and there that would have done well to stay on the final cut. Next is not so much a deleted scene as a set of deleted or extended scenes that follow a particular story arc. Again I agree with the deletion, but I have to admit there was some nice scenes taken out (even if they did mess with the flow of the movie).  Bloopers and outtakes - Just as it sounds. A montage of mess-ups for you to enjoy. Not much in the way of belly busting funny, but if you like the behind the scenes camaraderie that you usually see in stuff like this it will satisfy.  Real Steel Second Screen: Ringside With Director Shawn Levy*  - This is to access interactive content on your PC or iPad while simultaneously watching the movie. It's worthless if you do not have a device to sync to.  I am normally the type of person who shies away from \\"popcorn flicks\\" but this one is very well worth making the exception. It's fun and excitement for the whole family. If you ever liked underdog sports movies you gotta check this one out.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I felt about this book as I did the first (Matched), a little slow. After reading the first novel, I felt compelled to follow the story. I found myself getting frustrated that chapter after chapter drug on without much excitment. The end got a little better and I'm interested to see how it ends in book 3. I will continue with the series out of curiosity but was disappointed that Crossed did not prove more entertaining. I'm hoping that book 3 is better.
1451627289|5.0|Stephen King had me hooked from the very first page of '11/22/63' and left me wanting more upon my completion of reading his novel.  A beautiful story told in the first-person narriative of its instantly likeable protagonist Jake Epping/George Amberson, King so brilliantly combines elements of science fiction, history, suspense, action, drama, romance, comedy and even undertones of horror into one sweeping epic of a novel that is impossible to put down.    A stroke of true genius can not be forced, and no element of any genre is forced into this novel.  '11/22/63' is the product of a genius at work, plain and simple.  The consistency and intensity of the story that Stephen King was able to maintain for a bit over 800 pages left me in awe.  I am not a person who must finish reading a novel no matter what, even if my interest were completely lost.  I would not have continued reading '11/22/63' if I felt I were wasting my time.  On the contrary, I tried to read it as slowly as I could because, while I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next, I honestly didn't want the story to end.    Don't hesitate.  Buy '11/22/63', read it and hopefully you will fall in love wth it the way I idd.  It was a true pleasure to read and I will undoubtedly be going back to it.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I bought this as a christmas present for my husband. We went to see it when it came out at the movies. He loved it and thought it was a very good and funny movie. He was very happy to receive it as a gift for christmas. We recommend the movie!
B00000251N|5.0|This is the masterwork from Neil Diamond. Wonderfully orchestrated, written and executed. Part pop, part classical but totally Neil Diamond. This recording was a spiritual and artistic culmination of Neil's body of work up to this release. The man who was lost between two shores found peace within. His work never got so introspective again. Even his most recent works are more reflective than introspective. He no longer felt fear of being Done To Soon. Neil got his own Traveling Salvation Show and didn't need Brother Love's anymore. He no longer felt the need to engage the store bought women Cracklin Rosie. He no longer needed to hold Sweet Caroline to release the hurt. After this album, Beautiful Noise and the middle aged beautiful music scene for Neil. His days at MCA/Universal records were over. Bang Records and the Brill building become distant memories. From here on out he would lament not being brought flowers, enjoy Tennessee Moons, all while staying Forever in Blue Jeans. Rarely do single recordings demark such a career turning point. I sense he flew with that little gull and simply moved on. I enjoy this album today as much as the day it was released. Really does not get any better from Neil Diamond.
B000002J5K|4.0|This is my husbands 3rd copy of this CD! First one got destroyed; second one got left in his old truck when he sold it! So, maybe the third time is a charm! LOL! I bought this to replace the last one for christmas. He laughed and was happy to see it. We both recommend this CD!
B004EPYZXU|3.0|do not, i repete, do not watch this film before going to bed.  you will spend the nite, if luckey, trying to talk folks out of killing you.  luckily i tried talking them out of it, by demanding that i be aloud to write a will.   on one dream. and telling the folks id infecy them if tried.   thankfully i woke up on those ocasions to wiz.  thank god for beer!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|This game is fun but it repeatedly lost my game progress, which was not that great.  I prefer not to repeat levels over and over, which is why I uninstalled the game.
0060873027|2.0|This doesn't feel anything like the previous Crichton books.  It is clear that it was unfinished and the author who ended up finishing the book didn't seem to be familiar with other works.
B002MU4NLI|5.0|I love this movie! The packaging is so pretty and well wonderful! It's really a great buy, a must have in any movie collection.
B000G759LW|5.0|This is a really great album. I understand why people don't like this, because they are use to hear christina as a pop singer with pop hit songs. In this album, shows  off her talent, she has a beautiful loud voice & vocals, that ain't nothing wrong about, she's very talented. She plays tribute to one of her favorite artists & inspirations, Etta James, and it really sounds like her. If you like Etta James, Aretha, Blues, Soul, R&B, Jazz, (only modern) you will love this album. But if you're used to hear pop songs & to see Christina as a pop artist, you'll find this album boring. Great Album, Great Vocals, Great Songs. It's a good tribute to soul & blues music.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Ihe math settings are great! I can't just hit a tab and roll over and fall back to sleep. Love this app!
B005TBN3EU|1.0|I loved the Hangover movie. The first movie was so hilarious! It made me laugh until the end of the movie. The Hanover part II came out- I was so excited to watch it. Then I was disappointed with the movie... it did not make me laugh at all. I felt that there were many parts in the movie where people had to suffer pain. I did not find it funny at all. Do not buy it. It would save you a lot of money- trust me.
B004QDCZ3M|4.0|Save three dollars by buying the standard edition of the CD.  The added CD in the \\"deluxe\\" edition is Florence's clunkers and near-clunkers.  I loved the standard CD and played it six times.  I almost lost my dinner when I played the extra CD in the \\"deluxe\\" edition. For completists only.
0937381888|5.0|This book is an excellent guide for the home brewer.  I appreciate Mr. Palmer's explanations of what is going on during the stages of brewing.  I feel I really understand the whole process after reading this book.  I especially like the last part of section 4, \\"Is my beer ruined?\\" where he gives you advice about what could go wrong and how to correct it.  Cheers!

0765365278|2.0|Alright, I'm about 500 pages into this book and frankly I don't see the hype throwing it into a number of best \\"Epic Fantasy\\" Top 10 lists.<br /><br />The story is slow, for 200 pages it seems that Dallinar is having visions going nowhere, arguing with his son, confused and thinking too much...while Kaladin is breaking his neck trying to improve the bridgemen.  The plot moves at a snail's pace, similar to The Wheel of Time (IMHO) which is why I gave up on that series after the fifth or sixth book.<br /><br />This fantasy world is crazy and some things are really annoying.  For example,<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />1.  It is beneath men to read, they are read to by women.  Now, tell me how this works for a general during a battle?  True, they use glyphs all the time, but still...reading maps without written text, troop formations, troop numbers, names of battle sites, etc. etc.  I don't know, maybe I'm crazy by not thinking that glyphs could cover all of this.<br /><br />2.  I'm tired of all the 'spren which seem to emote with anything that happens (flesh rot, working hard, creativity, fear, anger, etc.).  I think I've seen some 'spren around me emoting \\"BORED\\"!<br /><br />3.  The text \\"Storms\\" is used too frequently.  Stormfather!  Highstorms!  Stormlight!  Storms!  Okay, I acknowledge that the series is \\"The Stormlight Archive\\", but can't it be toned down.<br /><br />4.  There isn't enough history given of the fantasy world.  The book started off with some history and you get pieces here and there of the Voidbringers, Radiants, etc. but it's infrequent and disappointing because it could add so much to the book/series.<br /><br />5.  The war with the Parshendi is tiresome and filled with the dilemma of bridges, bridge runners, crustaceans pulling bridge siege engines, falling into chasms, etc. - when are decisive battles going to appear?  Finally, something new appeared with Dallinar noticing that a Parshendi general was wearing Shardplate.  Wow!  Something cool!  Kaladin finally discovered that the Parshendi are crustaceans themselves.  Wow!  Weird and reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean and the crew of Davy Jones.  The Shardplate, Shardblades - very interesting and the opening battle in the book was awesome.<br /><br />I'm not impressed with \\"The Way of Kings\\" and seeing how this is the first Brandon Sanderson novel I've read, I was expecting a lot more.  The book is over 1200 pages and it moves so slowly that it should have been truncated to 600 pages.  I'm too far in to let myself quit, but for now I cannot place it in the Top 10 \\"Epic Fantasy\\" list.  The \\"Kingkiller Chronicles\\" and \\"Malazan Empire\\" series are so much better.  I truly hope it improves.<br /><br />My 2.5 cents...<br /><br />Big D!Wow!  Weird and reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean and the crew of Davy Jones.

B002TLSSXO|5.0|These utensils are great. I got them for my girlfriend for Christmas, and she said they work really well, she loves the vibrant colors. And they seem very sturdy and solid. We have only had them for about a month but they seem like they will last a long time. It is funny that the \\"elevate\\" feature hasn't been seen anywhere else. It seems so simple and basic, but it was a great idea that works really well.  Overall, I am glad I purchased this set over any other set out there, and I would recommend them to anyone.

B004MC8CA2|3.0|When I got my kf, I wanted most of all to be able to read and take notes on scripture. This YouVersion app makes that very effective. My biggest complaint is that the notes require you to be nonlinear to take, which prevents me from using that feature during service.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I have finished this series in a week which is uncommon for me. I was terribly disappointed by this last book. It seemed rushed and thrown together, especially at the end. Read the first two and then let your mind make up the rest!
0375413405|5.0|I was so intimidated to try this book, but after finally ordering it, I love it!  It's not only a different way of cooking; it's a different way of looking at food. Well worth the wait!

B005HS4CUY|1.0|When we received the set of Toy Story, 2 & 3 for my grand daughter, as her Christmas gift, we were full of excitement that she'd have the fun of her life seeing her favorite movies on 3D. We have a full 3D setup with a 51\\" Samsung 3D-TV, a Samsung Blu-ray HD, 3D DVD player and the 3D glasses that came with this set. We had excellent viewing of other 3D DVDs that we had purchased, but not this time.  All three DVDs have flaws as they stop/ repeat the scenes frequently. It is quite annoying, as we have to use a \\"work around\\" to continue viewing!! We don't have the receipt for the purchase we made directly from Amazon, and it has been a chore finding someone at Amazon to talk to about this problem, and perhaps a solution for it.  The \\"work around\\" we found is to use the \\"Forward\\" button when the hiccups happen. This would make the DVD go beyond the hiccup points, but the interruptions are still annoying and a turnoff. She has managed to view all 3 DVDs using this work around. But, it is a cumbersome solution for a 6-year old!!   PLEASE KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS AND DELIVERY PACKAGE JUST IN CASE YOU EXPERIENCE THIS PROBLEM. We try to purchase our future DVDs from other sources, like the Disney stores, etc. -- Amazon's products' quality is questionable.
B002QGUFWE|2.0|Just so everyone knows, the album cover photo may vary.  It is the deluxe edition, but the album cover photo might not be the same.  This caused confusion in my house, and I found it aggravating.
030788743X|5.0|This book is a must read for any fans of games, movies, or television, especially if they are science fiction or fantasy related.<br /><br />The novel is not wholly reliant on plot because it takes time to give us moments with the characters that reveal their lives and the world that surrounds them. A great amount of detail is given to describing the the world of the main character and the various technology that he uses which makes even the smallest actions more engaging.
B00007KWHG|5.0|No problems at all with the order.  The selection of music is great.  The quality is great too.  I think this CD is a good choice if you want a good quality selection of Frankie Valli's music.

B000K2Q5X4|5.0|I had been ripped off before, but not on this one.  Yes, it was expensive, but I really wanted this CD.  I should have never thrown out the old tape before checking the availability of the CD!
B003Y5H5HY|2.0|I don't why I wanted to see this. I've never read the book or seen the original Swedish movie. I know they wanted to establish character development for Daniel Craig's character, Mikael, and Lisbeth Salander but it took forever for something interesting to finally happen. The film is told by two story lines at first, then finally meet up at about 90 minutes in. First off, I thought Daniel Craig's storyline was a little boring. He's asked by a man named Henrik to solve the murder of his niece that happened 40 years earlier. (You can have a drinking game when Daniel Craig puts his glasses on and takes them off every time he finds another piece of the puzzle) Then we have Rooney Mara's hot awkward Gothic character, Lisbeth Salander. I loved her storyline and her character. She is the only good thing about this movie. She's a computer hacker that deals with mental issues and rape. Later in the movie, she becomes Mikael's assistant in finding a murderer. I probably wouldn't recommend THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO!!!
0553573403|3.0|I'm deep into the third of the series, and I'm getting tired of reading it.  It's sad to make it so far, but I kinda don't care what happens anymore.  Martin writes well, and his characters are interesting.  The problem is that there isn't a whole lot of focus.  For example, we spend the first two books reading about Daenerys wandering around a different continent and brooding about reclaiming the throne at King's Landing.  It's not until mid way through the third book that she actually gets her hands on an army and you think something might actually happen.  Look, plot and character development are important, but two book's worth of development is too much.  Cut to the chase already.<br /><br />Lots of scenes are over developed.  Yay, here's another feast and Ser This and Lady That are present.  Martin will consume a few pages describing all the party guests, and none of it matters.  You won't encounter most of these people ever again.  Who cares?  Yeah, he'll describe all of their coats of arms, and maybe it's fun to imagine a different one for each household, but after a while it gets like those ubiquitous \\"Life is Good\\" t-shirts (Oh, now the stick figure is bowling...spare me).  Martin has gone with the more-is-better approach, and it just makes you skim read a lot of the time.<br /><br />Martin can't stick to any plot.  Arya is escaping and trying to get home.  Great.  This will be good.  Oh, wait, she got captured.  Oh, but now she escaped again, now she's captured again, now she escaped again, now she's captured again.  Is there any point to her flight or did Martin realize that if she lets her get home too soon he won't know what to do with her?  So far, all we have is several books of her running around the continent and not really doing a whole lot.  Hey, I'm not done with the series just yet, so maybe she gets whacked on the next page and I can stop pretending to care about her.<br /><br />The books are good, but they drone on and on for far too long.  There are far too many scenes and events that don't advance the story.d events that don't advance the story.

B005Y1B3Q0|5.0|I love me some good ol' fashioned action. In recent years action movies have tried to incorporate pseudo-intelligent plots amidst all the glorious explosions. While there is nothing wrong with wanting a \\"smart\\" action movie, I tend to lean more towards action movies that are over-the-top, loud, and obvious. Some of my favorite action movies have plots that are so improbable and bombastic that it seems that they were written by 5 year old boys on a sugar high. But that's the charm of old-school action movies. The bad guys are really bad, and the good guys aren't afraid to crack a few skulls. I had been trying to fill my craving for silly action movies with artsy action flicks of recent years. The Bourne trilogy? Too much shaky cam. Super hero movies like Iron Man or X-men? While very good, they are not action movies through and through. Then The Expendables comes along. When I saw it in theaters, I tried really hard to love it. But the fact is that it was missing something that I couldn't quite put my finger on. The explosions and silly plot were there. Sylvester Stallone was there. Arnie was there. Hell, Bruce Willis was even in on the fun. But, damn it, I couldn't bring myself to love it. I really liked it, but I couldn't love it. Then I saw this extended director's cut version on sale.<br /><br />There it was. The action movie that I had so desperately craved for so long. The silly seriousness of it all, the corny rock music playing during the action scenes, the needless one-liners. It was finally all there. Damn, that was satisfying. It was like putting in Rambo 3 and instantly shutting off your brain and going along with just how ridiculous it is. So there it is! I am a sucker for really corny action movies. The Expendables: Unrated Director's Cut is superior to it's theatrical counterpart in every way. Not too mention that it looks absolutely spectacular on blu-ray. Highly Recommended!
B000002U9L|5.0|I love this CD!  Labyrinth has always been my favorite movie, and now I can have the music anywhere.  David Bowie is so tremendous and this music is too!
B0063IH60K|3.0|The graphics on this game are not as engaging nor as nice looking as those on the Solitaire Free Pack app.  Uninstalled.  EVO  3D
1601253788|5.0|This is yet another great product in the Paizo Pathfinder Role Playing Game ruleset. It is the third of three monster books, and it is chock full of all sorts of both classic and new creatures, including a large number that are Asian-themed. The art (as always) is amazing, and each creature is carefully written up to provide plenty of both \\"Fluff\\" and Crunch.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|These blu-ray use the A/B/C region classification system. The set of blu-ray discs included are classified as all three, indicating region free viewing. Works flawlessly on a PS3 for the US market. I was hesitant, especially at such a good price, but it was fully worth every penny and more!
6304696515|5.0|A great cast and a great story. The acting in this movie is exceptional. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's. a great game for free.  The ads are even good and you can skip them in a second if you want.
B001LF347E|5.0|I bought this box set because I love the show but the commercials on SyFy are SO LONG!!!!  This set was super cheap, and great quality.  The bonus disk has a \\"making-of\\" segment that any Merlin fan would love.  If you love Merlin, you will go nuts over this box set.
0312641893|4.0|Oh, my god. This is by far one of the best Young Adult books I've read. I rarely read book series because usually the first book isn't compelling enough, but this one has me excited for the second book, which will be based on Little Red Ridding Hood. With that in mind, you'll easily see it the reference to Red Ridding Hood in the book.   The first page or so was kind of hard to follow when Cinder was diddling with her foot, but once I got past that it was easy reading from there. There's definitely a good depth of plot that's not present in most of the Young Adult books I've read. The characters were likeable, even the stepmother and step-sister. The author did a good job of making the step family sympathetic even though they were mean to Cinder, and they were sympathetic because they were mean for a reason and they didn't hate Cinder just to hate her, especially at the end when they made life for Cinder almost unbearable.   I loved the prince, too, and the ensuing romance. I loved how the book ended and the setup for the next chapter in the Lunar Chronicles. 2012 has already been off to a good reading start with this book and I hope more good reading comes my way. :)  This book is futuristic sci-fi and obviously a reimaging of Cinderella, but the future technology in the book is nothing new. In fact, I'd say the \\"futuristic\\" technology in this book is old news and is probably in every other sci-fi book on the shelves. I think this book would have benefited by having some technology that I hadn't seen before in movies/TV or read many times in books.   The reason this book didn't get 5 stars is because most of the \\"mystery\\" - including the supposedly big twist - in the book was obvious. In fact, it was kind of annoying that it was kept a \\"secret\\" until the end, because I guessed it early on in the book.   Still, this book was pleasurable to read and I definitely want to see how the Prince and Cinder's relationship continue to develop throughout the series.   I know this is very early to say it but this is definitely going to be one of my favorite books of 2012.  This is a review of an advanced copy of the book.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|This movie was amazing to say the least and probably has the best ending of any movie i ever saw.
B004LROUW2|2.0|1Q84 is a completely overrated book.  As I read the 925 pages (sometimes painstakingly so), I anxiously waited for something spectacular to happen, but it never did.  I don't know if I've ever read a more repetitive book in my life!  I found myself saying (aloud at certain points), \\"I'm not a moron; you just explained this plot line/character/scenery/etc., 5 pages ago!\\"  I forged on to the end of the book, thinking that there MUST be a unique, thoughtful closing right around the corner.  Alas, the ending was, in my opinion, a total cop-out.  Murakami ends the novel with such a simple solution; one that the supposed intelligent characters, not to mention a 5 year old, would have thought of 800 pages before.  Maybe he got in too far, and had to wrap it up.  Or maybe, just maybe, he got bored with his own work, and chose the abrupt Hollywood ending he thought would be appreciated.  What I also find ironic is how Murakami describes Tengo's writing; how he repeatedly edits and trims the fat from \\"Air Chrysalis\\"...it's a shame no editor dared, or was allowed, to do this with 1Q84.
B001B6PBBK|3.0|I was feeling like a cute chick flick, but overall was a little disappointed with the entire movie. The movie really has no true point I guess, it even lost the cute chick flick feel. There was no character that I felt inline with, no one I could sympathize with, there just wasn't a character that kept me involved in the movie. It comes of too sappy, just not a movie that fill the bill so to speak. I really consider it a decent 'C' movie at best; okay to watch as a freebie, but I would never actually purchase this movie.
B004OBQDHK|5.0|The film shows a life that many would like to have ... alias, who would not want to live surfing all day and parachute jump .... course, exclude the assault

B00664AM5C|4.0|The realisim of this film is daunting. I can see how this kind of outbreak can occur.   The actors were excellent, although some could have had more air time with greater storylines.  I finished the film, went and washed my hands and then proceeded to wash all the light swithches and   door knobs in my home.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Ordered this for my husband for Christmas to go along with his new Blu-Ray player.  He loves Avatar and was really excited by the 3 disc extended collector's edition.  Fell in love with Avatar all over again.  We will be watching this again and again and again for a long time.  Really great and Amazon.com is really great also.
1451627289|5.0|I often don't get this fired up about a book I've read. 11/22/63 by Stephen King. If you lived through the early 60's and remember where you were when you heard that JFK had been shot, this book will give you a powerful punch. If you did not, and love reading a master, you will be enthralled. 11/22/63 sets a new standard for top-quality mainstream fiction.

1451648537|5.0|I finished reading the Steve Jobs biography this evening. Though it may have this effect, it certainly did not strike me as promotional material for Apple. It illumined disturbing blemishes in Steve Jobs's character, particularly in relation to his abrasive and demeaning social interactions with others. Nevertheless, I leave the book inspired by his life's story. He was a complex and brilliant man. Well written biography.

0553801473|4.0|The first book in the series (Game of Thrones) has been my favorite book since I read it so many years ago.  Now that the HBO series is out I have been able to convert most of my friends and everyone loves it.<br /><br />The next two books in the series (Clash and Storm) were also very very good (if not quite as good as the first).  However, I was very disappointed with Feast.  Especially after such a long wait for both this and Dance.  However, unlike Feast I really enjoyed Dance.  Of course a lot of this was because most of my favorite characters were back.  Also I lot more happens and I especially liked the John and Reek chapters.<br /><br />Hopefully the wait for Winds will not be so long and it will maintain the great story telling of the rest of the series.
0307949508|5.0|Ordering was very easy.  It arrived on time and in the condition they said that it would be in.  My granddaughter was very excited to get this for Christmas.
1451627289|5.0|I started with Mr. King's writing with his novel's \\"The Shining\\",\\"Carrie\\" and \\"Salems Lot\\". My mother had a Reader's Digest Condensed book that had all 3 novels in one hard back book. I started with \\"The Shining\\" the old haunted hotel story about the Torrance family and their jaunt through the paranormal there. After that I was hooked and have read darn near everything Mr. King has put out since then. Including his last book \\"Under the Dome\\" and the quasi-Tolkein-esque series \\"The Dark Tower\\".<br /><br /> His latest book, 11/22/63, brings up something Mr. King hasn't REALLY written about as yet, Time Travel, and the resulting consequences of doing it. The story is yet another King masterpiece, that draws you in, hooks your imagination, and just keeps you reading and reading. I know I could barely force myself to put it down. If you like King at all, you won't be disappointed in this one. Mr. Kings ability to come up with stories that both grab you and make you want to finish so you can see how everything turns out remains and as long as it does, I'll keep reading for sure.[[ASIN:1451627289 11/22/63: A Novel]]
B005CA4SJW|5.0|Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!! Originally watched the series on Netflix and this was instantly worthy of being added to my movie collection.  The Series is Fantastic and I love the B/W version (something about zombies in b/w rocks).  The DVD extras give a great inside look behind the scenes and the story of where this Zombie Apocolypse came from.  This is a must have for any zombie lover!!

0312641893|5.0|Let's face it. Modern versions of classic fairy tales abound. And the story of Cinderella, her glass slipper, and her charming prince is an oft retold tale. However, only someone with a passion for fairy tales, anime, and Star Wars (after my own heart) could imagine the story with a cyborg foot in a future threatened by plague and intergalactic warfare.  Marissa Meyer's first novel in her Lunar Chronicles series is sure to enchant young adult readers and anyone who enjoys a great story, complete with political intrigue, romance, and mystery. You'll root for Cinder, a self-sufficient and feisty teenage mechanic with an endearing dose of sarcasm. And who could resist Prince Kai's humor, kindness, and struggle between his own needs and his duty as an heir to the throne? Meyer's futuristic world and characters are both tangible and touching. I can't wait for the next installment in Cinder's tale! I usually wait until an entire series is complete before I read it, because I have absolutely no patience. I literally CANNOT wait. But Macmillan was generous enough to send me an advance reader's edition, so the least I could do was devour the book in three days.  Meyer also has three upcoming books planned that are inspired by other favorite fairy tales. I intend to keep a close eye on this YA author.

0451228375|5.0|Don't miss these 2 books.  In my opinion, these are the 2 best historical fiction books ever written.  Ken Follett has the ability of bringing both the characters and the age to life in a way that no one else can.  I just hope there is another book that will pick up the Kingsbridge saga somewhere inside his brilliant mind.
0060873027|3.0|I had this book on my Christmas list because I've loved almost every book written by Michael Crichton. That being said a few days later I read it cover to cover and at the end I felt mildly disappointed. I think my disappointment was rooted in the fact that Mike had started what was sure to be a fantastic novel but instead was reduced to \\"I'll buy it at the thrift shop in ten years if there's nothing else to read\\". Don't get me wrong, the book is entertaining and it has a good plot but its missing the sincerity of a Crichton novel. I'm sure that if Mike were alive we would all be raving about this book regardless if the plot was original or not. I give a lot of credit to Richard Preston for even attempting to finish this novel because its a tall order to write a Crichton book and I think we can all agree on that.  Now I'm not entirely sure who the proceeds of this novel go to but I'm sure that the Crichton estate receives a rather large portion. With this being said and despite the dissension of \\"true\\" Crichton fans I suggest you buy the novel in honor of Mike. I would like to think that real fans would appreciate the unfinished idea even if the finished product by a different author was unsatisfactory. Mr. Crichton, my hat is off to you sir.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|This package has all the episodes. the Cd's are stack on top of each other, you can chose separate them or keep them the way they came, however, I will be very careful.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was a late comer to the series- it had already been cancelled!  But the Fillian touch is gold- funny and witty interactions with the cast and the story lines are clever. Then watch the full length movie- Serenity to get some- not all answers!

B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Following the story of Parzival/Wade and his gunter friends is a fun way to spend a weekend, just don't expect to understand the meaning of life after reading this book.  Positives:  *Very much a page turner.  In general the plot is fast paced throughout.  *Lots of references to the 80's, with some to the 70's and 90's sprinkled in for good measure.  It is obvious that Cline loved the 80's and painstakingly included everything he could remember.  *Bad bad guys, good good guys.  Simple.  *Main character is highly intelligent, remembers everything, can do things on the first try that only a few other people in the world are able to do (perfect game of pac-man anyone?)  Negatives:  *Occasionally gets bogged down by the author using the book to express his own view points.  i.e. When Wade is saying that he wished someone had told him the truth at the beginning.  *In some areas too many 80's references are jammed in with too much explanation of each and every one of them.  Hitting the highlights that were relevant to the plot would have been as effective for a book of this depth.  As a counter point though, it is a very good representation of the thought process of a gamer trying to figure out an easter egg in a game.  *The final message about how important reality is seems a bit out of place.  Yes there were references to it throughout the book (the brothers, etc) but still...it just didn't feel quite right.  *Characters are simple but grow in spurts.  However, it can feel a bit forced at times.  Overall a very enjoyable book.  I would recommend it to geeky friends but it won't be for everyone.
0739341782|1.0|This book had the most racist paragraph that I have ever seen in a novel. The daughter of the main character surprises him with a fianc&eacute; from Peru. The parents look to see how dark he is before they even speak to him. They are then relieved that he is actually a couple shades paler than the white...but tanned father. They then proceed to describe him as handsome(i.e. not dark) for the rest of the book. The fianc&eacute; was also acceptable because he could speak perfect English because he was educated in England. This whole thing was wrong on so many levels. Since I am a middle aged woman, I have bought and read many novels by this author. This is my last one. This blatant racism and insensitivity hurt my feelings and made me sad.
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|I accidentally came across with Steel Panther while browsing the internet. I was appalled/annoyed by the first few videos that seemed to me degraded the \\"best\\" hard rock of the 80s by some hipsters who really could play. (but I know that hipsters can't play). Also, the musicianship was so good that it looked condescending to even the kings of hard rock, the mighty Van Halen. So, as I listened to more and more of the songs, especially on their second album, I came to appreciate these guys and was slowly sucked into the panther-territory. All of the 80s rock bands gave up on the high-tech, hard-rocking party music in the last decade or two. (see Def Leppard). Here we have Steel Panther carrying the torch, in a bizarre way. Each song is hilarious (with filthy lyrics), and each song offers a 21st century version of pure, no-compromise party rock. The overall visual/musical package might look like Motley Crue in 85, but there are hints of Van Halen, Judas Priest, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi all across the album -- however, the sonic intensity turned up to 11. If I was a rapper or an alternative/post-modern rocker, I would be wetting my pants in horror right now, because Steel Panther is here to make them whiny posers pay for stealing the soul of rock and roll. They will begin by stealing their girlfriends.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Our family likes to play board games, so we are enjoying this game.  It took us a while to totally understand the rules, and ended up watching a video on line about how to play.  Once that was done, it takes about 60-70 minutes to play and its a fun game trading resources and trying to figure out how to get the longest road without other players noticing.  Good for 12+.

B003O86FMW|4.0|In many ways I enjoyed this second book in the Hunger Games triology even more than the first...and I liked the first one a lot. By this time I guess I felt more \\"invested\\" in the story line and the characters, and I also found the plot a bit more intriguing (meaning, although I still knew how it was going to turn out, there were some twists and turns along the way that I definitely did not anticipate.)<br /><br />As with the first book, I found this to be a quick, easy read with a fascinating story line and vivid characters. I also love the way it ended (leaving me with no doubt that I'll read the final book to see how it all turns out.)  I could have read the first book as a \\"stand-alone\\" but not this second one; I can't wait for the rest of this story.

B002MW50KO|5.0|The arrangements take the listener back to the live Christmas specials during the radio days of the 1930s and 1940s, with Bob Dylan projecting the lyrics like a pop vocalist of that era who is more comfortable on the smoke-filled stages in the honky tonks than inside the slick theaters found in major cities. The \\"pin-up\\" photo of Santa's helper and the art layout/font on the CD add the finishing touches to the music that is dreamily delightful ....no matter the season.
B005TZFZJC|4.0|This latest offering from Rihanna IS predictable but also highly addictive and enjoyable.  In comparison to her last album, LOUD I am enjoying more of the singles on TTT except for the ballads - they're not bad, I just haven't connected to any of them yet:<br /><br />WE ALL WANT LOVE gave me a \\"hmmmm\\" moment, I like the sentiment of the lyrics but it's not an inspired track;  FAREWELL - sounds like something they'd play for ousted American Idol contestants and FOOL IN LOVE - very ok, nothing special to it except the guitar solo.<br /><br />On to the good, which the album has plenty of - catchy, melodic, fun, danceable tracks!  My instant faves:<br /><br />WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN - I go into an imaginary dance trance on this one<br /><br />TALK THAT TALK - although I could've done without Jay's verse and one more pre-chorus from Rhi this is one of the tracks that I catch myself humming during the work day<br /><br />WATCH & LEARN - oh, the double entendres on this track!  Love the breezy arrangement and her quick singing the chorus<br /><br />DRUNK ON LOVE - this is one of those tracks where I wonder what it would sound like if Rhi was a better vocalist because as is she has to virtually shout the lyrics to convey emotion which can be unpleasant to listen to but yet and still I really like this song<br /><br />YOU DA ONE - another breezy fun track (although I don't think it was strong enough for a single release ya never know how the public will respond to a song)<br /><br />COCKINESS - more double entendres but such a catchy track<br /><br />BIRTHDAY CAKE - naughty interlude (can't wait for the full track release)<br /><br />DO YA THING - don't care for the lyrics (allowing your guy to disrespect you?) but the arrangement is reminiscent of RUDE BOY<br /><br />The songs that are \\"ok\\" to me are: WE FOUND LOVE - it's growing on me but I'm still kind of 'meh' about it; RED LIPSTICK & ROC ME OUT<br /><br />I also want to comment about the cd packaging - with the deluxe version you get an expanded digi-pack casing which I am getting sick of because they do get damaged over time no matter how well you treat your cd collection.  You also get a booklet full of pics of Rhi and postcard like copies of both TTT album covers and finally a very sparse album liner that is a little difficult to read because the info is all squeezed onto one side while her 'R' logo covers the other (waste of space) but in total makes a good presentation and collection item for fans.<br /><br />My gripe is that I wish instead of so many pics of Rhi they'd done a better job of presenting the album liner information. Looking back at her RATED R album liner there were a lot of pics of her along with the album information and it worked so I guess they were trying to reward her fans this time around with the pictorial.  I also wish that they had added a \\"making of\\" dvd - I enjoyed the dvd that accompanied her LOUD cd because it allowed us behind the curtain to see her working on her album.<br /><br />Overall though, I would strongly recommend getting this album - there are just too many catchy songs that you'll have a great time listening & dancing to.w well you treat your cd collection.

0312641893|5.0|Last year during Fairy Tale Fortnight, I hosted an interview from this lady, Marissa Meyer, who had a book coming out in the misty distant future about a cyborg Cinderella.  It sounded quirky and weird and awesome, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it to share it with you this year for FTF.  But uh...turns out I couldn't wait until April to share the awesomeness that is Cinder.  (But no worries. We'll find some other way to get Marissa and Cinder involved in FTF this year!)<br /><br />Clearly from Fairy Tale Fortnight, I love a good fairy tale retelling.  I even occasionally love a bad fairy tale retelling.  But what I absolutely love most about any fairy tale retelling is when the story can stand on its own.  This is where a lot of retellings fail, because without the recognizable elements that some rely on too heavily, the story falls flat.  Thankfully, that is not at all the case with Cinder.  All of the familiar set-pieces of Cinderella are definitely there, but Meyer doesn't use the fairy tale as a crutch.  Even if you don't know or like the original fairy tale, Cinder is complete and interesting enough on its own; it has enough going for it that it should work for fairy tale lovers and sci-fi fans alike (and if you like both, like me, then Cinder is just a treat).<br /><br />Now, this is not to say it's not predictable.  Of course it is.  It's a fairy tale retelling - we already know the characters, the plot points, the motivations.  But in a retelling, it's not so much about the story but what you make of it.  And I have to say, this is absolutely one of the most creative and unique twists on a fairy tale that I've read, but what's even better is that it's not forced.  There's good depth and believability for such a potentially outlandish premise. It doesn't feel like Meyer sat down and said \\"How can I make Cinderella weird/new/different/innovative?\\"  The sci-fi/cyborg elements don't feel forced on the tale, they feel more like a natural evolution, and where Cinderella was our lovable outcast of the past, Cinder is our lovable outcast of the future.<br /><br />And she's strong.  She's smart, she's spunky, she's brave.  AND SHE'S NOT A SWOONER.  (I mean, other than when her cyborg body sort of overloads and kinda sorta electrocutes her.  But that doesn't count.)  My point is, she's not simpering, and her elevation from outcast status isn't going to be wholly dependent on a fairy godmother and Prince Charming.  She intends to take control of her own life and make it what she wants it to be.<br />[Ignore me while I jump up and down and scream \\"Yes! This!\\"]<br />She has her hardships and has to continually work against prejudice, but she's competent and perseverant and I ' her for it.<br /><br />Add to all this that the stakes are legitimately high, not just for Cinder but for her entire world - tough choices have to be made and bad things actually do happen, and there is just enough doubt in the readers mind that maybe things won't be very happily-ever-after.  It's not saccharine, and I ' Marissa for this.<br /><br />But above all, it's just story telling that worked for me.  It reminded me of Firefly and Ever After, and a million other things that I love.  But it didn't feel derivative of those things; more like Marissa grew up with the same loves and interests as I did, and they wormed their way in, just a touch, to give the story this enjoyably eclectic feel that nods to all these things that came before, but builds something entirely its own.<br /><br />And I cannot wait to see where the story goes in the rest of the Lunar Chronicles series.<br />(So bring on Scarlet!)s our lovable outcast of the past, Cinder is our lovable outcast of the future.

B006QPVH6O|3.0|I watched this movie in theaters with alot of anticipation, but it didnt satisfy me.The concept of real life astronauts going into space and encountering some unknown horror got me really excited, but I think the problem with apollo 18 is that it simply didnt execute the idea very well. I don't really remember getting scared really and I think I only jumped once.[SPOILER] And when I finally saw whats been terrorizing the space crew, I guess my opinion of it is EHH! whatever, nothing too spectacular or new [SPOILER END].But I dont want to call A18 a waste of time, If your into sci-fi and horror then it might be worth a watch on a free night.But sadly I feel that A18 is just another greatly potential vision that doesn't succeed and will be just another movie that'll be lost with the wind soon, but hopefully in the future someone will build on this idea because of how awesome a story it can really be.Final score=2.7 out of 5

B006RED4GA|2.0|I was expecting a quality horror movie but I got was snooze fest. Both actors in this movie are terrible, they have no acting skill and the plot is big enough to drive a truck through. I can't believe i paid $10 for this movie. The reason i gave two stars is for the ending. Most of five star reviews are from family and friends of cast and crew who had no prior reviews.
038533348X|5.0|This author made me fall in love with literature.  His wit and dark humor brought to science fiction what Carlos Santana brought to rock and roll:  A unique quality that created a new form.  I love pretty much everything Vonnegut wrote, but Cats Cradle will always remain for me one of his most impressive accomplishments.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|Shaky camera , poor actors , and budget special effects.I don't think anyone is trying anymore to make good horror movies. Watch Moon if you want quality movie. One dollar from redbox  deserves two stars
B004FOA84A|3.0|I guess I'm not into this type of game. I love a good challenging puzzle but I just couldn't get the hang of this one. I had to use \\"spoiler\\" solutions to work through most of it. I give it a three because the price was right.

B004KRQFI0|4.0|Being new to the drum and bass scene, I'm not really any type of elitist or purist. I don't care if this isn't \\"real\\" dubstep or if lots of people hate this guy. All I know is that I dig the music. Lots of techno/house mixed with dirty wobbles and random bass noises.<br /><br />I didn't give this 5 stars, just because I am not really a fan of the stereotypical techno/dance female and rap vocals that get thrown in a couple of songs. If he did away with those, this would be 5 stars in my book. His \\"filthy\\" bass parts are the best in the business.
B005UKJX4E|2.0|I'm both regretful and grateful that I didn't see this movie in the theater. I'm sure I would have been able to better appreciate the soaring cinematography and the heavy hitting (if somewhat heavy handed) score. I don't want to tell anyone they can't like this movie, because I'm sure that it has enough emotional relevance to people that it could resonate somehow, but myself being a person who has already once or twice asked \\"why?\\" and \\"how?\\" to the sky, I found the filmaker's effort way too simplistic, rife with cliche, and overall BO-ring. I'm sorry, you may need 2hrs20mins to get to \\"The only way to live is to love.\\" But I'm pretty sure a few mediocre Disney movies beat you to the punch years ago. Yes, the movie is pretty at times, but so are the default backgrounds on my laptop. And as far as the score goes, music may not be my particular specialty, but I've always found that if I notice the music more than half the time, someone overdid it. This film, which I'm tempted to call an art-film, is just way too long. I don't know what person in their right mind thought this film was edited enough. And the balance between the sound/images and the dramatic arc/character development was way off, unless you like your movies light on dialogue, story, and development in general. As an experiment, I jumped around on the film, to see if there was a different tone, or perhaps a growth in the music and visuals over time. Nope. I skipped ahead and backwards 8 times and each time I watched the movie for 3 minutes to see if anything about the mood, tone, plot, or intensity changed, and I didn't see anything that built on what came before it, or that wasn't possible without preceding scenes. I almost wish the filmmakers had made a short of about 10 to 30 minutes, or instead, cut out any attempt at linear storytelling and commited completely to episodic mood scenes. My favorite, and least favorite, word is perfect to describe this movie: sentimental. Or maybe it's moody. Or dense?Or maybe we've all given this movie too much credit for being anything other than an example of how Not to make a successful film (both from a financial and artistic perspective). I'm glad it was only 99cents.

B00457WZEI|4.0|I'm not sure what I expected when I picked up this book, but I'm certainly glad I did. It is a wonderful story as it gives an unbiased account of war from an animal's perspective. Even though it is a young adult book, it has appeal for all ages. I was fully immersed in the story from the first page, but I was very disappointed at how short it was. I feel like much of the story could have been expanded upon and depicted in greater detail.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I started reading this book and instantly fell in love with it. I fell in love with Travis even faster. I had to stay up and read until all the characters were happy again because leaving them in a spot where they were a disaster left me feeling depressed. I was really sucked into the book and loved every last word.  I do understand the concerns about Travis' violent behavior but I know guys that are like that and it does not always mean an abusive relationship. Travis and Abby work good together because they are both so hot headed and have strong opinions.   My favorite part of the book was seeing Abby interact with Travis' brothers.  The book in all was amazing. I only saw a few typos and I am thinking that may have happened while transfering the book and making it an e-book. Even authors with publishers have typos in their books.   Thank you Jamie for such an amazing book. A book I am sure I will read again and again.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just finished this book, oh, two minutes before writing this review? I'm filled with so much sadness,yet at peace with the ending. Don't expect some frilly ending where everyone lives happily ever after and \\"God bless us, everyone!\\" is said by little Timmy. The ending is good, but real. Katniss has gone so through too much to snap back to a frame of mind pre-war. She suffered intense mental and physical injury in all the three books. How could there ever be a fairytale ending?  But, everything fell into place where it logically should be.   I think most will be somewhat pleased by the overall outcome, but missing a few characters we've come to like. At least Katniss has the promise of new life even in less promising conditions, of hope- everything the dandelion has symbolized to her and keeps her going.   Make sure you have a box of tissues handy.

0440241413|5.0|Its been ages since I've read any chick-lit but when I found this book in a box of \\"free stuff\\" left at the mail boxes (ironic hey, its about overspending and I find it for free) Anyways I grabbed it (along with some other useless crap) and immediately started chuckling.<br /><br />Reminding me very much of Bridget Jones's Diary, this was an equally fun read, that had me LOL more then once at the antics, irrational decisions and downward spiral of a shopaholic who, oh yeah also just happens to be a financial journalist. Here Becky Bloomwood counts $$ like Bridget counts calories; binging with shopping sprees, going on cost cutting diets, avoiding the shops, scheming about how to make more money (because she can`t possibly spend less and just HAS to have that new white coat)<br /><br />Becky is an irresistible heroine but she generally makes a mess of things and it was super fun watching her make bad decisions as she fumbles through her job at Successful Savings, shopping away her lunch hours while trying to avoid her bank managers calls.<br /><br />Speaking of which her over stimulated Visa card almost becomes a character of its own here, and her bank manager eventually does with the inclusion of hilarious letters from Endwich Bank and the ever inventive ways Becky finds to not pay her Visa bill or in most cases ever even receive it.<br /><br />Ah yes, there's also romance, intrigue, adventures in Indian cooking, unsuccessful part time jobs, a stalker(?) best friends, copious amounts of champagne drinking and a fantastic ending that will leave you smiling. This is an all around feel good book that reminded me why every once in a while some chick lit is a fabulous thing and best of all this was free...<br /><br />And let's face it we've all been there with the credit card bills which we tend to ignore as soon as that excited feeling hits us upon first entering a store.

B0050SYS5A|5.0|The title of the review pretty much says it all. The Zoom for Xbox Kinect is perfect for those of us that don't have a great deal of space to flail around to our favorite Kinect games in. It significantly decreases the amount of space you need to give the Kinect in order for it to accurately function. It clips right on to your Kinect very easily, and I've no problems with it thus far.

B005WFWVL4|4.0|Steven Soderbergh has amassed an interesting body of films, from sheer popcorn entertainment (the first OCEAN'S 11 movie), to the art-house fare (CHE), to the offbeat (THE INFORMANT!), to the Oscar-worthy (TRAFFIC), to the crappy (the second and third OCEAN'S films).  I broke this down as much as I did to get across a specific point: Steven Soderbergh knows how to make a movie, and not only that, he knows how to make movies HIS way.<br /><br />CONTAGION is proof.  It's a solidly-crafted film revolving based on a Scott Z. Burns (THE INFORMANT!, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM) script.  The film follows various individuals amidst a pandemic: a grieving father/husband; a group of research scientists; an investigator; a conspiracy blogger; and the virus itself, as it passes from person-to-person.  Soderbergh again collects an impressive cast: Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Jennifer Ehle, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Bryan Cranston, John Hawkes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Elliot Gould, Dmetri Martin, Sanaa Lathan, and others.  Standouts include Matt Damon, as the afore-mentioned father; Winslet as a field-researcher; Fishburne and Ehle as her colleagues; and Gould in a criminally-small role as another researcher.  Other actors are wasted in thankless, meaningless roles and subplots (Cotillard, Law).<br /><br />This latter flaw is what really holds the film back.  As with all massive ensemble films, it's easy to get things tangled, to add to much fuel to the fire.  Soderbergh, usually capable of juggling his casts, seems to lose track; certain story lines are left unfinished (and not in the good, ambiguous sort of way), and other story lines are utterly unnecessary.  If the film had focused more on its heart (Damon) and science (Winslet and Fishburne), or even its politics (Cranston), it would have been much more stable.  As is, it's riddled with holes.  This won't stop your enjoyment of the film (note the four stars), but it does make us wonder what this film could have truly been, were its script honed a little finer, and it's director not quite as ambitious.honed a little finer, and it's director not quite as ambitious.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love solitaire games and I am so grateful for the high quality free games.  this spider game is very good.  only complaint....I don't see Undo.  made a foolish move late in game and could not undo.  I am still happy with game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a really fun game. it definitely kills some time. there is a good variation of games and it downloaded fine.
0307891402|4.0|Given that, at the time, the book was out of print and a collectors item, as well as being hard cover and over 650 plus pages long, the amount I paid for it was tolerable, if a little painful.  But I cannot complain about the quality of the product nor the timeliness of its delivery.  I would definitely buy from this merchant again, though perhaps something a little more affordable.  Still, it makes a marvelous companion piece to the game itself.
B003O86FMW|4.0|once katniss everdeen returns from the treacherous HUNGER GAMES, she has to choose between gale and peeta.i personally think she should choose gale but whatever. its announced as a special anniversary of the GAMES she has to compete again. the whole idea behind the \\"ticktock\\" island is SO AWESOME!!!! so much is revealed in CATCHING FIRE it barely gives you a second to put it down and pick up MOCKING JAY.
1401229921|5.0|I'll begin with a warning.  Do NOT get this book if you have not read the source material it is based on, the graphic novel \\"Hush\\" by DC.  These are only Jim Lee's pencils and rough paints of the entire story.  Get only if you are like me and like to see the artistic evolution of a great product.  I find this stuff fascinating and educational for me, but most people will be lost or bored.  But if you want to see just what is involved in making a critical step of the graphical art process, by all means, read this.  Jim Lee is a master who should take his place among great artists like DaVinci, Dore and Dali.  He is arguably the best artist in the comic field ever, ranking with McFarlane, Perez, Wrightson, LaRocca, Byrne, Seinkowitcz and Kubert.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This is a good app for the people/kids who like strategy.The main issue that I have is what is the fun in it everyone loves the challenge. So I will not rate this five stars just 4 because of the challenge but I do like the creativity in this.
B00325NM6E|5.0|I won't reiterate the universally glowing reviews of Watchmen that are in other reviews, suffice to say that Watchmen, along with Frank Millers \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" is the book that shoved graphical storytelling (oh, all right, comics) out of strictly children's fare into truly adult material that stands on its own as true literature.  Many people look down their noses at graphical stories, but that is simply snobbery.  This book is an example of what a truly gifted writer and artist can do with the comics medium.<br /><br />That said, this edition is only for the superfan.  It is incredibly reproduced with some interesting additional material; but, if you have not yet read it, get a cheaper version, because the Absolute Editions are quite pricy.  The additional material will not add anything to your reading pleasure.  You are not missing out.  But for the superfan like me, this is a lot of fun to have and is a great addition to any library.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I think the kindle fire Angry Bird app is a good app that lets you express your feelings to the lives like someone that's bullies you.However I will not rate 5stars because of violence programs.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|When I was introduced to The Walking Dead comic a couple years ago, I was blown away.  Great, taut writing that is thrilling and unpredictable.  At first, when I heard it was coming out on TV (not on HBO), I was immediately suspicious.  American TV has very strange rules, as are American sensibilities.  We can see all the gore and violence we want, but show a boob or say f--k, and many Americans' ears and eyes begin to bleed.  A strange dichotomy, to be sure, but there is a lot of all of these elements in the book, as well as some very extreme situations that I thought would not translate well to the small screen.<br /><br />It turns out my fears were unfounded.  AMC was able to take a great book (for more info, see my or other reviews on the compendium) and make a truly great show.  The focus is still there; that is, the main characters are what is important, not the zombies.  They are almost incidental to what is going on.  They just frame the situations the characters must face, and that is the true genius of the story.<br /><br />But something else I found great about the TV show is that it does not slavishly follow the source material, changing it subtly in places, drastically in others, to create an all-new entertainment experience that rivets me to the tube every week.  If you read the book, it is a good introduction to the show and vice-versa.  But what is great is if you liked one, you only get the outline for the other.  You get two great experiences.<br /><br />The extras on tacked on and like most DVD extras, are totally dumb and unnecessary.  Mostly, it is just people in the cast, crew and writers congratulating each other on how great it is as a story and how wonderful it is to work with each other.  Honestly, I can only see this so much until it makes me throw up.  Tell me interesting stories in making it, obstacles you had to overcome, the adversity of making the show.  None of these productions are harmonious in nature or smooth in execution.  I want to know the hiccups and travails.  THAT, ultimately, is what is interesting.  But the show is really why we buy these things, so get it and be prepared to be wowed.<br /><br />One last thing, do NOT show to children.  This is some pretty extreme stuff, hard R to NC-17 territory.ails.  THAT, ultimately, is what is interesting.  But the show is really why we buy these things, so get it and be prepared to be wowed.  One last thing, do NOT show to children.  This is some pretty extreme stuff, hard R to NC-17 territory.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I take every opportunity to try & get people to watch this movie! SOOO underrated!! I completely agree with the other reviews. This is, without a doubt, the best movie I saw in 2011 & possibly the best sports movie of all time. It deserves so much more recognition than it's received to date.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|First, let's get it out of the way.  The Dark Side of the Moon is Pink Floyd's greatest album, the one you should check out if you have lived on the moon and never heard anything by Pink Floyd.  That said, why should you buy this fairly expensive re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-release?  Frankly, none.  This is reserved for those who absolutely LOVE Pink Floyd and want to see the evolution of this incredible album.  Now, if you are a super fan, like me who has a few bucks to burn, this is a great package.  The included liner notes are okay.  There are three marbles, yes, playing marbles in it.  Not sure why they are there, but they are neat.  There is also a pattern scarf which is kind of nice.  Interesting but unnecessary reproductions of backstage passes, tour posters and the like.  But the real superstar here is the music.  If you buy any of the too numerous to count remastered releases of this album and play it on normal equipment, you will probably not notice too much difference.  But, if played on some good, high end equipment, the release of the original material is phenomenal, with the great differences in the peaks of synamics for which Floyd is so famous.  The live album is interesting as well.  The rough cut of the record, I thought, was underwhelming.  Much has been made that you hear Syd Barret's guitar playing on stuff just before his breakdown, but honestly, I thought it was unnecessary.  When I hear rough cuts, I like to see where the song was coming from and its evolutionary process.  Sometimes with radically different versions.  Unfortunately, this has none of that.  The DVD is fine, also, but unnecessary.  The cd version you are getting is top notch.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|This is my favorite movie - right up there with Tangled. The music really makes the movie but even without the visuals the music is incredibly moving.<br /><br />Not surprisingly this has a lot of tones similar to the ones on the Braveheart soundtrack, which I love.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun, just know u must earn points to unlock games!  I have been addicted to it to try and unlock all games.
B002H3EUAE|5.0|Many thoughts come to mind when I think of Christmas... Family, Friends, Presents and so on. The first thing I usually think about when I hear Christmas? National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. Some may think A Christmas story, Elf, Miracle on 34th Street among others. None of those touch Christmas Vacation. This movie screams Christmas to me! I absolutely love this movie. There have been years where I have lived this movie. This gift set is the ultimate gift for that person who loves this movie. It comes with a blu-ray edition of the movie. Much better picture but the same features as the DVD.It comes with a packet of instant snow which I am sureI will never open or use. Next is the coasters. Various character coasters that have quotes from the movie are nice and good quality. You have a santa hat with a marty moose emblem on it which is nice quality. You have a I survived a Griswold family christmas which is great I wore it this year with pride haha. You also get a marty moose mug but its a mini replica and can't be used. My only gripe about the whole set I wish it was full size and useable. All in all its a great Christmas movie that you can watch over and over and the gifts you get with this collectors edition is well worth the extra money. Definately buy this and enjoy every Christmas!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Yes, Lucus did change things. Many things, in fact. Personally I have been a fan of most of his changes except for the replacement of Sebastian Shaw in the final scene of ROTJ. Yet, there is one change in which Vader screams no when the emperor is about to kill Luke. For me, that adds more character and shows that he is turned. It is not silly. The picture quality is great, the audio is amazing, and there are a few things I see still wrong but do not care. If you see all the one star reviews, those are hardcore Star Wars fans. They want the original theatrical release on Blu-Ray with none of Lucus's changes. That will not happen for some time. I gave this five stars because the movies are wonderful, the color is great, and the sound will blow you away. Not because of its changes, that doesn't make this bad. So, if you're thinking of purchasing this item, and you are not worried about 10 second changes, get it. Unless you agree with the one star reviews, you will not be disappointed.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Pixar movies are always incredibly amazing. They have humor that reaches adults as well as children. They can tell a wonderful story and have great messages to go along with them. Cars 2 left me a little dissappointed. I loved the first movie but the second wasn't nearly as good. I am not sure that the whole secret agent thing was a great idea. The movie definately has its moments and it looks gorgeous in HD and has some really nice 3D effects for those who have 3D-TVs. Aside from the story that was just a bit weak its still a great movie for all ages to enjoy. The 5 disc combo pack is a great deal. Not only you get a 3D movie, you get the Full HD, a DVD and a Digital copy. Its a win-win for anyone. I have watched the 3D version, let my brother borrow the Full HD Blu-ray disc, Let my sister borrow the DVD and put the digital copy on my iPhone. It really makes it easy for you to enjoy this movie in so many ways.... at home, on the go with your phone or ipod and even in a portable dvd player in the car. Its definately a no brainer to purchase. If you love pixar movies you shouldn't pass this up or if you love movies in general.
B005ZUR724|1.0|Played it for one week on the fire, and then it needs to be updated, and cannot. Will change it when, or if, the problem is resolved.
B003297I1U|5.0|It is a large toy with several ways to control the movement of the crane... my kid is in love with it and takes it to bed (yes even though it's huge!) every night.   It is a bit expensive but it is very well built and in my opinion worth every penny! Strongly recommended.
0823003590|5.0|I've been waiting for a book like this forever.  As a portrait artist, this is the most concise book on portrait drawing I've seen.  Well done.
B004GYY714|5.0|I normally do not write reviews but this app does more than expected. I'm getting rid of my table radio. This app gets many more stations and each one clear as a bell.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This item is amazing and I recomend it!! I got this item as a gift on Christmas and it is fun,entertaining,and a litle fustrating.Only because there are some places where it seems impossable,but thats what makes it epic.I relised in other reveiws that pieces were loose and at the botom,but mine was perfectly fine and no boken spots.I brought this on a 12 hour drive trip and it kept me(12),my brother and sister(17),and even my little brother(5)entertained throughout the trip.Even though my little brother got upset when the ball droped of the course.This item is a no-brainer toy for kids interested in puzzling stuff.This toy is unique because it makes you think in every possable way to get the little ball through a big maze/course.I still have not yet gotten to the end but im working my way.Plus there are many practice courses to help out your skills.The practice courses are little entrences into certain spots on the courses!!I have to say somtimes I have fallen off one thrack to another or jurked the ball to where it hops on to a random track.There are some spots where the ball(when not in the course)gets stuck espesialy by the outer stairs,but a little tap will fix that.Over all this is a great product and a great buy for any consumer.If anything I wouls give this toy five stars.This toy is magnificent for kids 7+ I would say.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Bought this for my 18 year old daughter, and it was her favorite Christmas present.  She has already used it a lot, and it seems very sturdy.
B004UID2LC|5.0|love this app, wasnt working right until this recent update, thanks so much DEV for your constant developement of this app I recommend it to everyone constantly. :-)
B006OOHYIC|5.0|if you enjoy puzzle games this is a good app for you. it begins fairly easy but soon you'll findcyour self forced to slow down and think each move through. you have the option of compleating each puzzle or repeating each one until you can find the right moves for a perfect game. each perfect game gives you one tolken to use to buy a hint for later puzzle. it is quite addictive. as a stay at home mom it allows me a moment to do something that fights against the daily mental stagnancy .
B004EPYZSU|5.0|If you like westerns and sci fi, then you will love this movie.  It was a great blend of the two and of course if you like Harrison Ford it is a must see
B005KELS6Q|3.0|Pink? Not really. This is a nice little case for the new kindle fire or kindle touch, but not great. The case would protect your kindle from nicks and scrapes in your handbag or just being tossed around, but I prefer a hard cover, in case my kindle takes a tumble off the chair. This cover offers very limited protection. The color is horrible; more of a Salmon than pink. Nothing wrong with it, but not a cover for my needs. This cover will not fit older versions of the kindle.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|There seem to be plenty of task/todo apps around to choose from, but I especially liked that this one said it would sync with Google Tasks.  That would set it apart so I could do some task management on PC too and/or print from PC.  But I keep getting \\"Full synchronization error, Try Again Later\\".  No idea what's wrong.  No logs. no clues to troubleshoot.  It initially connected to my Google Tasks fine and populated the Kindle Fire. I made some updates on the KF and now they are stuck there.  this part gets a 0.<br /><br />The rest of it seems okay -- easy to navigate, clear displays.  This part gets a 3.<br /><br />Update:  I got the synchronization working, such that it is.  I reset everything and rebooted KF. I made sure the task folders both existed in both locations (perhaps avoiding a syncing bug).  App pushes from KF to Google well, but doesn't seem to sync the other way yet automatically.  I will have to figure out the magic sequence to force a sync.  No sync button.<br /><br />Also, besides the Jan 32nd error, other sloppy programming seen: Empty folders on Google Tasks get pulled with a single empty, unnamed task. Your classic off-by-one programming-101 error.  Don't they even test basic edge conditions?<br /><br />I'm leaving the rating the same but I am going to try it a bit longer because of the Google Tasks functionality.  I may look for other Google Task client apps.  There must be some...???<br /><br />Update 1/30/2012:  Its been working out well and I am using it regularly. I like that I can interact with Google Tasks on my PC and still have the app on the tablet. A solid 3.  Bugs are annoying but not dealbreakers.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It took the old Star Trek which only reached a certain fan base and made it open to all movie-goers.<br />The cast is filled with all-star actors and the whole movie is great fun!<br /><br />As with all Blu-Ray movies, the quality is amazing and the sound is one thing that you really need Blu-Ray quality for.<br /><br />There is also a hilarious blooper reel thats good for some chuckles :D<br /><br />Even if you're not a fan of Star Trek you can enjoy this movie, its action packed and has just enough comedy to make it perfect. JJ Abrams really does an amazing job with this movie and I can't wait for the sequel!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it!  Great time waster! I can literally sit and play it for hours.  I highly suggest downloading this game.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This app is pretty basic.  Once you find all of the old controls, it becomes more natural to use.  My only complaint is that your message inbox is not on the front page and it's not on the selling page either.  If you are a seller, you will want those questions about your items and new messages right there, but they are not.
B002I0J5FG|3.0|The easiest way for me to sum up these two games is that they have very moving stories and are filled with incredible moments, but they are also weighed down heavily by terrible controls, an obsessively cinematic camera that is more interested in finding a picture-perfect angle than letting you get on with the game conveniently, and overall very repetitive fights (especially in regard to Shadow of the Colossus).  Shadow of the Colossus is the better of the two games, but it doesn't quite deserve its reputation as far as I'm concerned. Most boss fights are pretty much the same, and while the first fight is nothing short of stunning it got old pretty quickly. It doesn't help that, as I wrote above, the camera angles are consistently annoying; the only time I found the camera to be nice was during the actual fighting, but even then there were times when it would move to downright absurd angles. The controls are also just bizarre and frustrating. There are several areas in the world where you need to make a few jumps, and it can be incredibly frustrating getting the game to let you jump in the desired direction; your character can get 'caught' on edges and so forth, which causes the overly cinematic camera to do some epic panning, which sets you up for a fall--this more than often just means you have to waste some time getting back to the point where you need to jump rather than dying.  I also need to comment on the running animation for your character Wander in Shadow of the Colossus. It's bad. I mean, it's really bad. It's like a bad joke if you view it from any oblique angle. I have to consciously try to ignore the animation when playing this game in order not to just lose all immersion.  Some of the translations in Shadow of the Colossus are bad. The grammar is often strangely mechanical and nonsensical as well. For instance, after defeating each colossus, an entity will say, \\"Your next foe is...\\" and then the next part of the sentence will not fit in *any* way grammatically with that first part. Another point that might not bother most people but was pretty bothersome to me is that the Early Middle English grammar used throughout is almost constantly wrong. The \\"eth\\" thing is added on at every opportunity and with no understanding at all of where it should actually appear. I do not detract from the game's score for this by any means and I recognize most people playing this won't even know the rules for Early Middle English themselves, but to someone who does it's hard to exaggerate how frustrating this is.   Now that I've really pummeled these games with negatives, let me mention the positives. The stories are absolutely top class in the world of video games. The music is practically worth buying separately. The games have a great minimalist feeling to them which is extremely rare in the gaming market now saturated with high-powered CoD-style games. The entire style of the games is one incredible breath of fresh air. It's no wonder these games are often cited as examples of how games can be pieces of art.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|This is a solid app if you are one of those people with a ton to do everyday (aka not me). Other than that it's really just an over glorified Callender app in my opinion. I would like to say there Easy Money app is the best money management applications out there and the devolper brings crisp clean user interface that reminds me of my &quot;Dough&quot; app for webOS :-) to there products.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun game a lot of variety in the different games can keep you entertained for hours and hours hard to pout it down
B001P06GX4|5.0|Great game, was recommended by a teacher, we found it good for all ages, was fun as two, three or four players.  I like that there are zip lock bags for each color tiles for storage and everything fits back in the box really easily.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|i like this app especially because i can no longer &quot;misplace&quot; my bible!  The reminders are good but they don't &quot;notify&quot; me with a sound  it could be me though.  i do really enjoy that the bible version can be customized.  they have a good selection of studies for adults but i think the choices for their teens could be better, more everyday things instead of specific &quot;negative&quot; topics
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This cover is a great deal for the price.  It protects my kindle fire and still works as a stand.  The stand portion can be a bit flimsy at times but it works.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cover for their kindle fire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is my favorite for the droid apps! it is definitely an amazing time killer! the only drawback is that you need to beat the games before you get more!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is a fun way to pass time. It loads quickly & the hints are helpful when you get stuck.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I recently decided to start increasing the size of my blu-ray collection, by mainly getting some of my favorite movies. Batman Begins is by far one of my favorite movies and an amazing retelling of the Batman legend. Amazon definitely had the best price for the combo you get in the deal. For $7.99 you're not only getting the blu-ray, but you are also getting an on demand rental from Amazon. I have not used the rental yet, but saw it pop in on the Roku box. Movie came in just a few days and the quality could not have been better.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- You get the blu-ray and a rental, so you can watch right away<br />- You can't beat the price, unless you get it used somewhere<br />- It's Batman and it's awesome<br /><br />Cons:<br />- None<br /><br />Overall great movie and great price. Well done Amazon.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is free and has many different translations with more on the way. Perfect for people studying the Bible and for those on the go. Love it!

B004LKRR6U|5.0|I don't collect too may of the regular Barbies because of the limited face style. But I saw this and had to have it. I'm not sure if it looks like Grace but it is a beautiful doll in it own right and dressed great. Two thumbs up!!!!??!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|What can i say other than this is one of the most emotionally frustrating books i have ever read. I went through every possible emotion reading this book. I went from ugh to anger to swooning to smiling to utter frustration. I almost threw my phone a couple times but thought better of it. Ive never been on such an emotional roller coaster reading a book before but i loved it, completley loved this perfect disaster. Love makes you do stupid things and this book is a good represetaion of that. I couldnt possibly read this book fast enough to find out what was going to happen, i figured Abby and Travis were domed to failure because she was to blind to see what was right in front of her. I need to read this book again and I definely will.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Riveting! I could not put it down. A must read for teens and adults! The plot is full of twists and turns so you never get bored.
B000FC1IPO|5.0|I never write reviews.  This book, was not only captivating, but it was a mirror. I absolutely love this book. I couldnt put this book down, because there is so much of me, that lives in these pages.

B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Usually when recording video with my Canon T3i, the audio would never hold up it's end of the bargain with the amazing 1080p video it shoots.  The audio was just plain terrible.  There was always a loud, annoying hiss, and it only recorded in Mono.<br /><br />This external mic is well worth the investment!  This microphone records in stereo and completely eliminates the hiss that would always drown out just about everything on the mic built into the camera.  And the mic runs on a single 9V battery, so it doesn't drain the camera battery.  I would recommend buying a rechargeable 9V battery to save yourself the time and money to run down to the store and buy multiple 9V batteries.<br /><br />Overall, I'm EXTREMELY happy with this microphone!  Highly recommended to all Canon DSLR users!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I&lt;3 this app swoon much! its fun entertaining, awesome, oh and didbi mention its fun?!  its challenging to unlock every box but its still the most amazing app I have ever downloaded! get this app!
B001PB3RU8|5.0|\\"Lungs\\" by Florence + the Machine is a diverse and very magical debut album. There is a little bit of everything on this disc, baroque pop, punk, alternative, rock, and even shades of bluegrass. Florence Welch proves she's a talented vocalist and songwriter. Her lyrics are cryptic and quite powerful especially on the track \\"Cosmic Love\\" in which she proclaims to her emotionally disconnected lover, \\"And in the dark I can hear your heartbeat, I tried to find the sound but then it stopped, and I was in the darkness - so darkness I became...\\" I can honestly say that \\"Lungs\\" and her follow-up album \\"Ceremonials\\" are worth every penny! Her music is so poetic and sometimes tongue-in-cheek such as \\"Kiss with a Fist\\". \\"You hit me once, I hit you back, you gave a kick, I gave a slap. You smashed a plate over my head, and then I set fire to our bed...\\" I love all 13 tracks, especially \\"Rabbit Heart\\" (Raise it Up), \\"Howl\\", \\"You've Got the Love\\", \\"Between Two Lungs\\", and the smash hit \\"Dog Days Are Over\\". The best track on \\"Lungs\\" is \\"Blinding\\" which is produced by Paul Epworth who would go on to produce \\"Ceremonials\\". Florence Welch is definitely a force to be reckon with! I highly recommend this beautiful, timeless album!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I am in love with this game it is my favorite game I have! I recommend it to everyone! If u don't like this app u r CRAZY!

B000E5N62U|4.0|When Steely Dan called it quits in 1981, the lead singer/keyboardist Donald Fagen soldiered on with a solo career the following year. He released the masterpiece concept album set in the 1950's \\"The Nightfly\\"- which was helmed by former Steely Dan producer Gary Katz. While the record was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, it took a while for him to follow up his debut- a long while. In fact, eleven years had passed between recordings when he released the sophomore album \\"Kamakiriad\\"- another concept album which was centered around a state of the art vehicle. \\"Kamakiriad\\" was notable for being the album that got Steely Dan back into the studio, being that fellow member Walter Becker was the producer and one of the instrumentalists on the album. Fast forward several years later, when Steely Dan reunited for two albums on Reprise Records- 2000's Grammy winning \\"Two Against Nature\\" and 2003's \\"Everything Must Go\\". In 2006, after a thirteen year hiatus Fagen released his third solo album- the self-produced opus about death and old age, \\"Morph The Cat\\".<br /><br />The album starts off with the title track \\"Morph The Cat\\", a song about a ghost-like cat wreaking havoc on a city. He sings about a band on the song \\"H Gang\\"- a short lived fictional band whose story is told by way of a film. On \\"What I Do\\", he sings about having a conversation with the deceased Ray Charles about his music. The jazzy \\"Brite Nightgown\\" tells three different stories about various people and their encounters with death- by way of sickness, robbery and a drug overdose. Donald sings about a suicidal woman on \\"The Night Belongs To Mona\\", and tells the story of a violent takeover of the U.S. government on \\"Mary Shut The Garden Door\\". While most of the songs deal with death, only one song on the album steps away from the concept. That said song being the humorous \\"Security Joan\\", where Donald gets flirtatious with a female airport security guard after his luggage sets off the X-ray machine. Overall, \\"Morph The Cat\\" is a good record from Donald Fagen, but could have been better if some of the songs were shortened in length. Still in all, it's nice to have an album from the creative and literal mind of one of rock's most underrated songwriters., \\"Morph The Cat\\" is a good record from Donald Fagen, but could have been better if some of the songs were shortened in length.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|This is a rich red, lush to the touch, great creative design. Love the choice of cities selected for the front and back covers. It holds my Kindle Fire tightly and the cover has stretched just enough over the past few days to close perfectly. I would choose this again and buy it for a friend. Best of all, the color makes it easy to find anywhere.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|bad and good not that close to the best. It wasn't the best. I think they should improve it more
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I'm pleased with the product and the logistic around the delivery.  I've received it in perfect status and on time
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|From the cover, I got the feeling this book would be creepy, and it was. It had the feel of vintage disjointedness, as though one is looking back at old photos and recounting a strange story. There is good build up in the book, but it comes to an ending that is less than climactic. Overall, an enjoyable read, and I would recommend it for its originality.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like what I have played of this game so far! It is very entertaining wand kills time! The games are fun and some are pretty challenging!
0525423656|5.0|Crossed was much better than Matched with a fuller exploration into Ky's past and character. Xander was a surprise and a pleasant one that threw me off. It's subtle like the rest of this book, how Cassia's romance with Ky and even Xander unfolds. There were parts that was a little slow, but I like my books tight and more concise. Xander stole my heart this time, rather than Ky so I'm for Team Xander.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Drag and drop clues to find the secret to grampa's house. Graphics were great, no glitches on the Fire and it's not overly challenging. It's too short though. I think it took about an hour to finish, but for 99 cents I had fun. The ending leaves the door open for future gameplay so hopefully the developers are hard at work.
B003ES5ZPK|2.0|This is a slick adapter for cable issues in tight places.  It worked well to conceal the cable out of my Roku.  However, it died after one week.  It gets two stars solely because of the interesting design.  If it worked, I'd give it four stars, deducting one star since it is somewhat bulky.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Basically you start with a set of games and you have to win in-game \\"money\\" to unlock other games. They give you enough money in the begining to unlock stuff. Some of the games are fun to play, some are boring, and the graphics are ok on the Fire.  After repeatedly getting only $3500 for playing air hockey when I needed $4000 to \\"unlock\\" something, I gave up and deleted it where it currently sits in cloud hoping to return to the starting line-up. It's currently free, so play with it for a while and judge for yourself.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I've tried other FM transmitters and the results have been lackluster at best.  Enter the Soundfly.  For the price, I thought I would give it a whirl and so far I have been thoroughly impressed.  I've yet to use the SD or USB features, so this review is focused solely on Aux input.  Specifically: Droid X headphone jack --> Soundfly AUX input via included 3.5mm male to male cable --> car stereo FM via Soundfly transmitter.  After finding a dead frequency (not easy in a metro area of over 1M people), I tuned the Soundfly to it and hit play on my Droid.  The sound quality was initially a little off so I tinkered a bit with the volume controls on both device and car stereo.  I've found that keeping the volume on my device at around 70% and then primarily using the car stereo to control the volume solved the problem quickly and the resulting sound and the transmission quality is incredible, by far the best I've ever heard via FM transmission.  I've now used this for listening to various genres and everything sounds good, from Rock to Electronica to Bluegrass to Jazz. Sometimes between tracks I do hear some white noise, but it is minor and when present it seems to go away the moment a track begins to play.  Given there is rarely any Dead Air (yes, that is capitalized on purpose :) playing when my car stereo is turned on, this is not a problem at all for me but felt it worth mentioning. If/when I use the other input features, I'll update the review accordingly.

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|This is a great app. The only reason I give it a 3 star rating is because android is not a very stable OS, especially on android tablet. I was creating a word document and all of a sudden the app froze. I did not get a chance to save and everything died. I understand that I should have saved myself as I was working but the fact is, this app and many others will continue to freeze on this OS so it would be nice to be able to do our work without freaking out about whether or not we are going to lose everything. Otherwise, great app. Thank you.
B000A7Q2DM|1.0|I checked this album out from my local library to see if it was worth buying. I found out rather quickly that this not an ordinary audio CD but a copy protected album. It will not play or copy. This being said I will not be buying this album. Don't buy this album or you'll be throwing your money down the drain.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|If you need any proof that this movie is worth seeing, just look at how divisive the reaction has been on this website. I've never seen a near equal amount of five-star and 1-star reviews. Look at the anger thrown in with the adoration! It's so fascinating getting the chance to see a true art film brought to the masses with the kind of advertising dollars usually reserved for blockbusters, because so many more people got the chance to be exposed to something they would never have seen otherwise. You might despise it or you might think it's the next Space Odyssey (I happen to be in that category), but do yourself a favor and sit down with this one. Become a part of the dialogue!

B005KELQEU|2.0|I received this as a gift with my Kindle Touch.  I also received another case that I had put on my Amazon Wish List and was debating about which one to keep.  This case is nice and has a good 'footprint' to fit into my purse, but once I put the Kindle Touch in it, I realized that it's just a bit too snug for it.  The zipper at the top right corner really needs to be 'stretched' around the corner to close it.  So I've decided to return this one and keep the original one I wanted.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|To make my review short and sweet, I absolutley loved reading this book and was so sad went I finished it. A friend of mine suggested that I read this book well over a year ago, but warned me at the time that the second book was not yet published and to \\"beware\\" that I would want more when it ended. She sure was right! I have an affinity towards reading vampire books such as the Twilight series and other \\"silly\\" fiction stories that maybe are considered young adult novels (although I am not a young adult), but I finally found a read that was intelligently researched and written -- and written for an adult demographic. I couldn't put this book down and plowed through it in just 3 days; just when I thought at certain points that this book really wasn't for me, the fast paced narrative provided twists and turns that were both expected and unexpected, and had me back on track and no longer second guessing it. While I initially didn't think much of the characters, they quickly found depth I was hoping they would and I soon felt connected to each one. I am patiently waiting to learn when the next book will be published. Do yourself a favor, and read this book!!!! You will not be disappointed, especially if you have ever read young adult fiction in this genre and yearned for a more adult like theme.
B005K2YZ5E|5.0|I received a Kindle Touch and this case for Christmas and this case is great.  Fits the Touch perfectly and mine has a velcro closure, not magnets like some others have commented.  Really cute colors and it fits into my smaller purse fine, so it's easy to carry.

B005TZFZJC|3.0|It is an OK album. Definitely more raunchy than Loud. There are some good songs and a few I could have done without! Loud is still my favourite and the benchmark that all her new albums will be compared to. Still I support her 100% as a fellow Barbadian!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He was SO surprised. Great quality, everything as expected. Took him 20 hours to build (note he is 39 yo).

B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Google Reader is one of my most frequently used apps!  I try to keep my bookshelf (application favorites on home screen) pretty clean, but gReader has more then earned its place on the top shelf!  Very easy to setup and use, has worked flawlessly with Google Reader - including 2-way synchronization.  The only downside is that the readers 'web view' used when reading a linked-in feed isn't full featured, but nonetheless this is five stars.
B001UN1KVE|5.0|This is a great movie, just as I remembered it from when I was younger. I did notice though that movie is rated PG but has every curse word that should have netted it an R rating. Not a complaint at all, but anyone wanting to avoid their children from hearing those words should a) Grow up and b) Avoid.  Otherwise, may the schwartz be you!
1933633867|5.0|This is a very interesting and important book.  Graeber's writing style is engaging and provocative, enjoyable and fascinating.  Graeber has been accused as being overly political in his interpretation of history and anthropology.  There is a warrant of truth to this accusation, but Graeber is dealing with highly political, and deeply moral, dilemmas which dominant history and have implications for contemporary circumstances, an apolitical book would be impossible (many philosophers of science (right and left), including myself, reject Hume's Law or the radical distinction between facts and values, really that is all Graeber has done).   At the same time Graeber is conducting anthropological science at its best and scholarship that is interesting to all human beings concerned with the distributional inequalities within the United States and between nations.   Below I attempt to divide the book into six major theses, in so doing it can be seen that the first five theses are historical and scientific, only the last is political.  In other words, the politics and science can be logically separated.  Given Graeber politics should non-leftists read this book, Yes!  Graeber's book is destined to become a classic text.  Graeber has the spirit of F. A. Hayek, not politically, but rhetorically.  Hayek's <<The Road to Serfdom>> (1944), is a highly political book (from the right) but with a very important major thesis, namely if the (philosophical) <<ends>> of intervention cannot be agreed upon, predatory politics will be the manifestation.  Hayek's economics are impeccable, his social theory intriguing, his analysis of politics second to none, and his understanding of history impressive.  If a leftist cannot learn from Hayek, and if a rightist cannot learn from Graeber, the impoverishment and the political bias is much more the reader, not the author.  What does one find in Graeber's book?  The primary thesis can be identified as `the duality of debt' (my term not Graeber's).On the one hand debt has a type of ontological expression, i.e. debt is what binds us as a species, e.g. we are indebted to our parents, family, culture, society for our well-being and personal development, and more theologically an indebtedness to the Cosmos/God.  This side of debt is found in its expression (i.e. language) and development.  On the other hand debt has an historical existential tendency to be employed to enslave or create circumstances of debt peonage.   Graeber's interpretation of contemporary debt is that it has this \\"duality,\\" it binds us socially (enabling many people to start a life) and has a tendency to (too often) put borrowers in a debt peonage relationship, not with the plantation owner, but with contemporary banks.   If the primary thesis can be expressed as \\"the duality of debt\\" there are several other major theses of considerable interest.  I identify six major theses.  (1) Debt predates money   This is important for several reasons.  I will mention three.  First money does not emerge with markets, which means that markets and money can be differentiated and analyzed independently.  Second, if money was not needed for market activity, this begs the question of why it was invented.  Third, the social properties, i.e. non-market properties of money may be crucial to understand it as a phenomenon (actually this historical interpretation impressively compliments Post-Keynesian theories of money and the contradictions of its functions, which is not mentioned by Graeber); (this thesis is borrowed and developed from the anthropological work of Mauss and \\"definitive\\" work of Humphrey).  (2) Government construct national markets   Public intervention is the root of markets.  Non-intervention, or laissez-faire is an historical oxymoron (this thesis is borrowed and developed from the work of Karl Polanyi).  (3) Primordial debt theory  The argument here is that debt is the basis of social-being.  This is the ontological/theological side of debt (i.e. we owe our parents, etc.).  Money is invented to quantify certain types of debt.  Now the tricky part is that monetary policy and social policy are necessarily linked and cannot be differentiated (this thesis is borrowed and developed from Aglietta and Orlean).  (4) Military-coinage-slavery complex  Historically the emergence of coinage (i.e. money) is linked with military efforts, which in turn tend to manifest debt peonage situations and enslave.  The most simple example is a monarch, in order to pay a traveling army, issues a token/coin and proclaims all subjects of the kingdom must return a said amount of these coins to the monarch.  The only way to get these coins is from the soldiers by providing them with some provisions, the soldiers pay in coin, and the subject/agent gives the coin as a tax back to the monarch (this thesis is borrowed and developed from Ingram).  What Graeber adds to this story is that it is quite common that the tax generates indebtedness, the indebtedness generates circumstances of debt peonage and enslavement (sometimes temporarily, sometimes for life).  He also demonstrates this is not simply a European phenomenon, but global throughout history.  (5) Historical attitudes toward debt/World cycles.  Whereas the first four theses were borrowed from various theorists, that Graeber then helps to confirm from anthropological studies, which he then synthesize and develops, thesis five is quite unique to Graeber.  His thesis is that attitudes toward debt not only change over time (he identifies four the Axial Age 800 BC - 600 AD, Middle Ages 600 - 1450, Capitalistic Age 1450 - 1971, Something Yet to Be Determined Age 1971 - future), but attitudes are also cyclical and global (Europe, China, India, Africa, etc.).  Broadly Graeber argues that the Axial Age tended to emphasize the quantification of debt, whereby debt peonage and slavery from debt was common; the Middle Ages were a time when the primordial debt was emphasized, and debt peonagetended to be resisted; the Capitalistic Age is a return to the quantification and systems of slavery and debt peonage; in the SYBD Age we see a resistance toward debt peonage and the dominance, not of monarchs, but toward financiers and banks begin to slowly emerge.  Whether the resistance will continue or a return to debt peonage (e.g. owing money to a bank for life) will continue or whether there may be some new institutional arrangement whereby the importance and dominance of financiers and banks is reduced is yet to be determined.    (6) History removes the veil of debt as road to servitude and peonage  The idea here is that when we witness different existential debt peonage throughout history, this helps to shift our own thinking on debt.  Why is it we must borrow money from a bank to start our life?  Although this aspect of Graeber's argument is not anthropology, it is a highly important implication from the scientific and historical investigations of debt.  If the contemporary circumstances are not analogous to the past, why not?  (Notice: it really is only here that Graeber is purely normative.  But it is a normative question that must be asked.  His answer makes it political.  However, his anthropology and scholarship strongly supports his politics).  This is a very powerful book on several fronts.  It is a very impressive synthesis of several different theories in economics, history, anthropology, literature and sociology (this part constitutes a very impressive scholarship) and develops a uniquely Graeberian interpretation and implication.  I highly recommend it and predict it will become a classic in economic anthropology.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Decent game. My girl and I enjoyed it quite a bit!  I have always been a fan of upgrade/unlockables. hi five to the developers
B004GHYCKW|4.0|I love \\"Let England Shake\\" and am simply astonished at people who claim to be PJ Harvey fans and yet not like this work.  I can understand if you just don't like her style of music in general (although her 'style' changes quite a lot from song to song and album to album) but if you are already a fan I can't imagine not liking Let England Shake.  I have listened to it many many times on my Sennheiser headphones and it's an emotional, incredible experience every time.  For me this album comes second only to Stories from the City Stories from the Sea in terms of rating PJ Harvey's best.  My only criticism would be that there are a few songs where she sings slightly out of tune for short periods of time.  I don't know if this is done deliberately as an effect or whether this was just missed or was everyone involved in making this album simply afraid to mention it to Ms Harvey?  In any event my classical-music trained ears notice it, but not so much that it's a real problem.  I'd like to thank PJ Harvey for giving us this album!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this game is fine. it doesn't require wi fi to play the free version. it doesn't crash unless your phone has a virus from stupid stuff. the only bad thing is the ads, which shouldn't really cause a problem. if you don't like the game don't keep it? simple enough.  overall i think its a good game, but i don't like the ads sometimes when i try to view scores

032180354X|2.0|It may be that David Hobby, the creator of the well regarded \\"Strobist\\" web site, does not own the name. Or perhaps he doesn't care how it's used (this seems highly unlikely). In any case, no one should confuse \\"This is Strobist Info\\" with that source.<br /><br />This book starts out with a small amount of text naming some of the current speedlights of Canon and Nikon and some radio triggers, light stands and light modifiers like umbrellas and softboxes. Next is a very brief explanation of the \\"inverse square\\" rule of light fall-off. The majority of the book is devoted to showing photographs captured with flash. On the left side of the gutter is the final picture, and the right side purports to be a photograph of the lighting set-up with annotations, such as the name of the lighting modifier and occasionally the distance between light source and subject. The bottom of the set-up photograph indicates the camera, lens and exposure data.<br /><br />The photographs might be described as \\"edgy\\", often showing large areas of darkness and shadow, tilted horizons and hidden faces. Unfortunately there is a sameness to the fifty photographs and the lighting techniques appear to be very similar. There are set-up photographs where the light sources are barely in the picture, and because of the darkness of the images, are hard to distinguish. The data provided in each set-up picture is not standardized.<br /><br />There is nothing that explains any lighting principles, like main light, or fill light. There is no mention of balancing ambient light and flash. One is left to derive these principles from the images, which I found to be so oddball that extracting any rules was extremely difficult.<br /><br />Add to all of this the author's sophomoric sense of humor. It is Scott Kelby squared. I really couldn't care about whether Diaz could find an appropriate closing sentence, or that there were dust spots that showed the lens needed cleaning, or that I-pod speakers at a shoot provided cheap entertainment.<br /><br />No beginner should start his exploration of artificial lighting with this book. Few experienced photographers will benefit from looking at more than a few of the images.uld start his exploration of artificial lighting with this book.

B000UJ48UO|3.0|Again!! I find myself telling all these people who apparently have no common sense how to review a Blu Ray movie on Amazon. If you want to know if this movie is good than please go to IMDB. But tell others THE IMAGE QUALITY!!! We should all help each other so that the movie industry does not rip us off by selling us so called Blu Ray when it looks like VHS or DVD quality. Image quality on this is perhaps just a bit better than DVD but far from Blu Ray. I will keep the movie.
B000002I53|5.0|In terms of jazz I find myself leaning more towards the West Coast sounds of Stan Getz and company. I find that Coltrane can be a bit \\"noisy\\" and his phrasing is a bit different than my jazz ears are used to. However upon my first listen of the track My Favorite Things I found myself with my eyes closed, transported to a higher level of thinking. Although it is a cover in a sense, it is hands down the pinnacle of what great jazz is all about. Sophisticated and beautiful. This song won me over as a fan. If you didn't enjoy A Love Supreme then try this one out.

B003EVFHYG|5.0|Not many movies come with such a good soundtrack.  People say you should wait 24 hours to buy something because you might not really want it (impulse buy), but 2 weeks later I still really wanted it and so I bought it!  Turns out it was a great choice.  Plus, it's a great price for an hour of some superb music!  I think the best thing is how Powell takes one basic theme which you hear in nearly every track, but somehow makes it interesting and powerful to listen to every time.  He did an excellent job of mixing emotion and feeling into each piece.  A few examples of this (and some of my favorites too):  \\"This is Berk\\" - A gentle intro with a hometown feel.. evolves into action!  This song contains nearly every theme of the movie. A great start to the album, movie, etc..  \\"Forbidden Friendship\\" - Playfulness  \\"New Tail\\" - Determination  \\"Romantic Flight\\" - Guess.  \\"Ready the Ships\\" - Impending danger, despair, dread  \\"Battling the Green Death\\" - Action  \\"Coming Back Around\\" - Triumph, conclusion  \\"Sticks and Stones\\" - Powell didn't write this one, but the style of it fits well with the rest of the movie and music.  A wise choice by the filmmakers.  I love this album, definitely recommend it!

But will i be able to?<br />After all, we're talking about a movie telling the story of a famous and important shoot and film, and of a few major American and British Icons making it!<br />Let me start with:<br />This film is not apparently so bad,per se: it is simply another one of those UK period productions, backed also by some American money,rich of exquisite visuals,gorgeous sets,extraordinary gowns, some real interesting upcoming actors and accomplished Stars,and a lavish,if anonymous, direction with colors, good pacing,sex,humor,drama,and even a bit of mystery,to serve such a nostalgic mix.It reminds me actually of another UK,even slightly bigger budgeted, production,also with a huge cast like Julie Christie,Romola Garai,Eddy Redmayne,Jeremy Northam and Bill Nighy among others,\\"Glorious 39\\". Well,that was, at least, trying hard to scare us with a fine Hitchcokian's plot and to present an unsettling twist,talking about 'appeasement' a subject matter,often way overlooked!<br />But this movie is sadly the triumph of superficiality!<br />I'd read the nostalgic, tragic book when it first came out(It feels yesterday but it was the late Spring of 1996!),never thought it was a masterpiece,yet maybe, one more way of digging into Monroe's endlessly moneymaking's source of Iconic stories.<br />But,at least,the novel was a real report of a conflict between 2 great actors: Monroe and Olivier,fighting horribly each other's on the set of the gracefully sophisticated comedy \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\"(1957)a very elegant and beautifully photographed(by another master: Jack Cardiff!!) Film,which had apparently a very sad shoot.<br />And at least, everyone felt real,even though,saying nothing new about the 2 great minds of these 2 great Icons,everyone was well depicted,and the shoot well remembered! It took almost 4 months to complete that film in London,and Warner Bros. was not too happy to hear that Monroe was often ill,or tragically lonely and unable to cope with reality,and go on with her acting job,while sir Olivier(who was also making a huge mistake by directing the lovely Terence Rattingan's play,instead of leaving that, to a more experienced comedic film director) was getting increasingly annoyed by his co-star,her rebellious streak, and her more vivid and natural way of acting(and photographing so exceptionally in any film,while not looking \\"all that\\" impressive on set: but that's film, and not Stage!).<br />Olivier apparently even tried to boycott her(but it may be gossip!),however,Marilyn,this time,and for the first time so much more than ever,was struggling a huge series of fears,and all by herself,trying desperately to please Olivier,the Studio,her manager and partner,Milton Greene(here just a cliche'role superficially played by Dominic Cooper)and even his, not so honest,but,super snob wife, Amy, who instead of being a friend to Monroe, soon became a judge(..and with which merits?)like feeling herself free to interfere with Monroe's performance.The Greene's had decided back in 1954,that MM was divine(too good of them!) ,but that 20th Century Fox(her well known main studio) was ruining her career!So, They convinced Monroe to strike against Fox, move to NYC,going to the Actor's Studio,along with Brando,Dean,Clift,Newman and so on, and changing her look into an absolutely very refined and more intellectual type of Blonde,photographed only by masters like Cecil Beaton and Richard Avedon,while asking for better pictures and bigger salaries!Not all of this was wrong,at all! And,in fact, her next picture became the best Monroe's film ever,the lovely,touching \\"Bus Stop\\"(1956),presenting Monroe,just gorgeous but with a whole new depth and Look!However all of this in a \\"A Week with Marilyn\\"(And,why a week? More like 17 weeks!!lol)becomes so superficially bland that The Inquire by comparison, may be,all of a sudden,a very profound publication,as well.<br />Marilyn was also trying to 'proof' herself with that film, to her new radical activist and greatest intellectual play writer Arthur Miller,whom she'd just married,leaving the World, completely confused. And,by admiring Olivier's wife,was trying to pleasing her also,and we're talking of course,about 'that Vivien Leigh',from \\"Gone with the Wind\\" lol also another tragic character, and alone wife of Olivier,which befriended somewhat Amy Greene,starting to looking down at Monroe and at her natural talent,like a too easy short cut for becoming such a superstar! And,while Monroe's NYC Actor's Studio faithful coaches(Paula and Lee Strasberg) were also for a while in London, trying to help Marilyn out,were seemingly instead,only there to be truly creating even more tensions and more tensions with Olivier who just loathed the 'Method'.<br />What a situation,uh? It might be as well the outline for a novel by Scott Fitzgerald or at least, from Edith Wharton,or David Leavitt,but this film takes on all the most shallow, predictable cliches,degrading (sorry but it really does!) some of the most important and most unforgettable Icons of the 20th Century,with suc a light script,way too light,way too 'insensitive' and lacking any depth for such material!<br />It miscasts Dominic Cooper,Wanamaker(as Paula Strasberg),Dougray Scott(as a laughable Miller!)Ormond as Leigh (C'mon!) and even Kenneth Branagh,who seems to have a hard time in playing what he normally plays best: Olivier! The only good scenes are those with Judy Dench(playing cordial supporting fellow actress Sybil Thorndike,a real Queen of the London's stage, who'd played the Queen Dowager in\\"The Prince and the showgirl\\" a true gem then.. and now!) and the excellent and handsome Eddy Redmayne(the real lead) becoming more infatuated and more infatuated with Monroe's presence and loneliness,while she seems here to leading him on.<br />And,now,Let me just say: Sorry, Michelle Williams!<br />I loved her in a few things..like the betrayed housewife in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\"or as the desperate working class woman in last year's splendid \\"Blue Valentine\\",where she was brave and strong,and real,<br />but she has just not the beauty necessary,nor the sensibility and finesse of one of the most emblematic and mysteriously tragic Icons of the 20th Century,who happens also to be,by the way,one of the most recognizable Faces on this Planet,even today!<br />What else to say?It's annoying because Williams not only is terribly miscast,and not sexy,not attractive (Hey, Does anyone remember Marilyn's fantastic,formidable,unique posture??)but what bothers especially is that she does not even try to be looking fragile here,but just a spoiled,often drunk movie star,living through this empty plot by almost giving the impression to be vile and arrogant!<br />I cannot forgive Williams for having NOT, at least,tried, to understand Monroe(it is always clear that she's miles away from the real Marilyn and her pain, But she is number 1 in accomplishing, and for the first time ever, a true dehumanization of one of the most moving American Tragedies,by acting always so unavailable to portray a personal anguish,pain and distress,which is truly all too bad,considering also that the strong make up effects and perfect reconstruction of some of Monroe's classic gowns are so out of place on Williams, to make her look,at times,just seriously laughable!)And so, while the film goes literally nowhere,dragging from a cliche' to the next,sadly creating some of the most ridiculous Portraits of famous Icons ever seen on East or West, to becoming just a sad,missed occasion for,at least, giving a more honest,more decent motion picture about one of the most gorgeous,tormented Ladies in Films and History,but just revealing instead little interest,and picking up like when it creates some time for hot Redmayne, to become something like the hot young idealistic stud trying to defend the poor 'Beauty' from the backstabbers,but, only because attracted and led on, even sexually, byher! This was not in the Book, at all!And it's in bad taste!<br />The two were always very distant, and barely exchanged a few words!!!<br />A simply ridiculous turn out,almost offensive, and,Williams,please,choose your roles with sense,as you've done so far... Marilyn is way out of your league: and it shows painfully!<br />So this may be one of those cases where a decently filmed movie is so wrong and vile to becoming a terribly dreadful movie, that I would like not to be watched by anyone, especially by those not aware of the Truth, like younger audiences,who should have been given, instead,a way more real,moral and much more different portrait of someone like Monroe, and her struggles,her people and her Times... Those were not Paris Hilton or Kardashian's Years, those were times were People still had high Ideals and Principles,and,when, Struggling for Fame, meant struggling for Art and Respect!ear's splendid \\"Blue Valentine\\",where she was brave and strong,and real,   but she has just not the beauty necessary,nor the sensibility and finesse of one of the most emblematic and mysteriously tragic Icons of the 20th Century,who happens also to be,by the way,one of the most recognizable Faces on this Planet,even today!

B004H1V5RU|4.0|I first heard of Perplexus on Christmas day after my niece received the original as one of her presents. It took me about two minutes to get hooked. Who would have guessed that the challenge of getting a silver ball through a variety of different pathways would be so fun?! After completing that ball in a little over a days time, I decided to order the Epic as a late present to myself.  I was so excited when I opened my package just two days after ordering it from Amazon (hurray for Prime!) I took the ball out of it's box and immediately began playing. Let me first say that this one is A LOT more challenging than the original. I had to do each number of the pathway very slowly at first to get the hang of it! I gradually made progress through the maze; however, about halfway through the pathways, I accidently dropped it on my hardwood floor while trying to manipulate the ball down one of the stairs. I laughed it off, picked it up, and began playing again when I realized the plastic ball itself had cracked. It was then I realized that the plastic they used to construct the outer plastic ball is VERY soft and therefore weak. I was sitting down, so it only fell a few feet. The crack occurred near where the blue plastic part holds the two clear plastic parts together. I was EXTREMELY disappointed as I felt that the last ball (original Perplexus) had much tougher plastic (I dropped it a few times as well and had NO problem). So far the crack hasn't affected the game; however, I have noticed that as I play more, the crack is becoming bigger (similar to a crack on a windshield). I now am concerned that if I drop it again, the whole thing may bust open and I'll have to get a new one.   My final take on this game: It's very fun to play and much more challenging that the original, just be careful where you play it!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I love all the movies. All of them. But I must say I wish they were not altered from the originals. There weren't many changes from the DVD versions but nevertheless I wish they hadn't changed them too much from the release versions.     Episode VI, however crosses the line a little too much. The scene in Jabba's Palace with the singing and all that jazz DOES NOT belong in this movie and should have been left the way it was in the release version. I feel embarrassed that they decided to add this stupid scene to the movie. At the very end they added Vader saying \\"no...NOOOOO!\\" when he saves his son, wasn't too annoying, but I still liked original better.     There are, however positive additions to this series that I would love to share one of. In episode I, Yoda does look A LOT better. I dare say he used to look more like a puppet than in V and VI, but now is animated much like  how he in in II and III. I liked this addition a lot and cannot say I miss the puppet version in the original episode I.     Overall, I give this 4/5. It's Star Wars. That is a given. I just kind of wish it stayed the classic way. I enjoyed the better quality CG but that is all that was necessary to make this series Great.    I got this because I did not have the whole collection in one set. So if you are thinking about giving this a buy, and you don't have the entire collection already, I would definitely recommend this to you if you're a star wars fan!
B005K15SPG|5.0|Got it quick.  Great music just seemed a little pricey. Maybe because it had more songs than usual.  For my daughter she loved it.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|This product is not very useful for my needs, BUT it's perfect for my 5-year old who is required to write journals for Kindergarten.  The guidelines are exactly what he needs and as long as we do one word at a time, mistakes are easily corrected with the backspace.  It takes some fore-thought to come up with the easiest use of this product for a K child (to avoid frustration), but so far it has worked great for me.<br /><br />My one and only complaint about this product is the delayed drag feature.  PLEASE ALLOW THE ABILITY TO TURN THIS OFF.  It is ver y frustrating to be writing then suddenly the text you're writing is being dragged around the screen away from the guidelines.<br /><br />Still, thank you for a fantastic product that is very useful for the little ones!
B004J4WQ46|5.0|The Strokes are one of my favorite bands. This CD has at least 2 number 1 hits on it and most likely more to come! You can't put a price on great music.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I am surprised this author is \\"unpublished.\\"  This was such an easy read, with fully developed characters and an engaging plot.  I look forward to the next (hopeful) adventure of Layken, Will and Kel.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|These two could not live without one another, but I thought Abby was stronger emotionally than Travis; w/o Abby, Travis would probably have to be committed.  Parker told the truth when he said they were dysfunctional.  All of the characters were used, even the fight scenes were believable, although Travis should have his brain scanned after taking so many hits. I thought that the blood being splattered was disturbing, it was as though communicable diseases does not exist.   Other than these kids skipping so many classes that they should've been dropped, the story was realistic enough to hold my interest.  I was glad that Abby had the sense to realize who she really should be with--thank goodness for her bf, America.    Even with all of their drama, and there was drama, this couple was better together than apart.  Travis was harsh, smart,and disrespected the women who allowed it, while Abby stood up to him and didn't hesitate to walk when necessary.  Takes a lot to make a roughneck beg you in public.  The ending was good, but I think both needed to ease up on the drinking & counseling (Travis for his intense dependency on Abby and Abby for her guilt with Mick).

B004MC8CA2|5.0|wonderful app - you can download any version of the Bible, which loads very quickly. there are also many other resources included. my favorite is the many different types of devotionals that are available... makes it easy to do a topicel study, a chronological study, Bible in a year, or a parents devo, and I could go on and on... AND it gives you the option to set a reminder ever day to whatever time you choose so your devo(or whatever) doesn't get overlooked.

0553573403|1.0|Holy Crap don't read these books!  I'm 52 and an avid fantasy reader.  I've noticed a trend in authors lately.  It seems they are not worried about thier stories.  All they are worried about is how long they can keep the series going, thus earning them more money.  This is one of those series.<br /><br />I liked book 1st even though I did have issues with the Starks being incredibly stupid politically.  It had potential.  By the middle of the second book I was getting a bit ticked that the \\"rules\\" of the world seemed to be changing.  New charectors being added for no other reason than to change a sub-plot.  People killed for no real reason.  It's like the author had no respect for his readers any more.<br /><br />But ok.  Maybe I'm being too hard on the books.  I have read so much that maybe I'm jaded.  Give it a chance.  I keep reading.<br /><br />I've gotten the whole set by now (all 5 books) and I'm currently on page 655 of the 3rd book.  We've now got magic coming out of the wood work, everyone seems to be a searer except the main people, new people are introduced for no other reason than to change a plot line and THERE IS NO MAIN FOCUS TO THIS SERIES AT ALL.  I just couldn't give a crap what happens to anyone anymore.  Too many sub-plots that are too intensly focused on and no main idea of anything in this world.  There is no focus to it at all.  It's like the author is just jerking my chain.<br /><br />I've only put down 1 series of books before the end in the past.  That was the Eye of the World series.  That author whored himself for more money and it was obvious by the 5th book.  I stopped reading it because I wouldn't give the man any more of my money.  Unfortunatly I have already got all of this series so I can't do the same thing here but if I hadn't he wouldn't get another dime from me.  The only thing I can do is warn you all off this series.  Just don't go there.  It's not worth it.  Really.  Read other negative reviews on here.  They have it pegged.<br /><br />Of course there will be young people who are just starting on thier journey into fantasy who will disagree with me or people who watched the TV series who had to read the books who will love them.  Fine.  That's his target audience.  But if you are a serious reader be warned.  These are NOT worth the time.ple who are just starting on thier journey into fantasy who will disagree with me or people who watched the TV series who had to read the books who will love them.  Fine.  That's his target audience.  But if you are a serious reader be warned.  These are NOT worth the time.
B004ZN9YNC|5.0|I first heard Pink Floyd in 1966, the Atom Heart Mother album and have acquired every one of their albums since.  Some how this one escaped me so glad to get it in 2011.  Pink Floyd - you got to love them.
1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs's legacy is ubiquitous in products we use every day. In 1978, I first saw an Apple II in a department store in Tokyo. Now my family has three iPhones, one iPad, and three MacBooks.  In Jobs's  lifetime, however,  I underestimated his contributions and I thank his biographer for setting the record straight and giving me a glimpse into who he was as well as what he did.<br />When a designer is obsessed with making products easy to use, you may not notice what is special until you have to use something else, as when I was professionally compelled to switch from Macs to Windows machines. Isaacson brings to life what struggles it took for the Mac to have a 1-button, cheap mouse that moved with equal ease in any direction and windows that overlapped like sheets of paper on a desktop. But, of course, the minute you use such features, you take them for granted.<br />In 30 years in Palo Alto, I never met Steve Jobs or heard anything about him but malicious gossip. His struggles as recounted in the book resonate all the more for taking place in familiar settings, like Eichler homes, reataurants like St. Michael's Alley and Il Fornaio, or Foothills Park.<br />Isaacson's biography also highlights the stunning paradoxes of his life, such as caring so much about product features for consumers and so little for the people he worked with, embracing the counterculture of the 1970s to befriend people like Ross Perot or Rupert Murdoch, or caring so much about taste while admiring the company that gave us mickey-mouse clocks and mashes all the world's great classics into formulaic cartoons.
1600595871|5.0|I love this book as a source for ideas for my books. Prior to this book, I tended to stick to pamphlet bindings because they were easy, but this book gives lots of great ideas for different ways to put your books together. The instructions are clear and there are both illustrations and photos of finished books in that style.

B005D0RDKW|5.0|I'm a huge Rush fan...so I'm going to totally ignore the entire issue of whether Rush really needs to put out a concert DVD & CD after every tour.  As far as I'm concerned, the answer is YES.  If you're NOT a fan, why would you care how many they produce.  And if you ARE a fan, you're probably a big fan...and thus, the more the merrier.  So how does TIME MACHINE compare to RUSH IN RIO, RUSH 30 and SNAKES AND ARROWS?  Well, each of those prior releases had issues.  RIO had some very sketchy sound mix issues, particularly in the early going...but it also beautifully capture the enthusiasm of that giant crowd.  The set list was very nice as well...I'm always happy to have \\"Natural Science!\\"  The 30th anniversary show is, IMO, the weakest of the bunch...partially because the show is incomplete (no \\"Between the Wheels!!\\") and partially because the German audience is lackluster at best.  SNAKES AND ARROWS was of excellent quality, but for me, the set list was not the strongest.  I'm not a huge fan of \\"Spindrift\\" or \\"Armor & Sword.\\"  TIME MACHINE has a primarily very solid sound mix.  Occasionally, there are issues, such as the nearly missing guitar in the opening third of TOM SAWYER...but overall, it's very good.  Geddy's vocals are spotty...on \\"Temples of Syrinx\\" he is pretty much unintelligible.  I understand the high notes he hit in the `70s are tough now (aren't they for all of us who were in high school at that time!), but it's still a bit unpleasant to listen to.  On the other hand, more current work such as \\"Far Cry\\" and \\"Faithless\\" really showcase Geddy  very nicely.  So from a quality standpoint, TIME MACHINE is right up there with the best of the other shows.  So what about the set?  Here is where TIME MACHINE really wins the 5 stars, in my opinion.  First of all, the complete MOVING PICTURES?  Are you kidding me?  If you saw the show live, perhaps you got chills like I did when \\"Camera Eye\\" started, finally, after all these years.  What a great 45 minutes of concert-going that all way.  And the discs have captured it very well.  Other great choices to hear include \\"Presto\\" and the under-rated but fantastic \\"Marathon.\\"  And having \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" is always a huge plus, in my book, and they knock it out of the park.  They also have some good reggae fun with \\"Working Man\\"...more than in the past, so that was a treat too.  The only minor grumble I have is that Neil's drum solo isn't as exciting as some in the past .  (Don't get me wrong, he's still a miracle-worker.)   So the above commentary works for the CD  (which I own), the DVD and the blu ray (which I own.)  I was going to post in the CD section, but now it appears that a posting to the CD also ends up with the bluray and vice versa.  So, here's additional thoughts on the blu ray:  it's great!  Great visuals (Rush's light show has never looked better on video) and outstanding sound.  I wish the bonus materials included the show finale with Paul Rudd and Jason Segal reprising their I LOVE YOU MAN characters, but I hear there were contractual things preventing that.  Otherwise, you might be amused at some truly vintage videos from the early `70s of Rush performing \\"Anthem\\" (why don't they bring THAT song back to their set list!) and \\"Need Some Love.\\"  Also, watch through the closing credits of the concert to see and hear a Polka version of \\"Closer to the Heart.\\"  Hilarious!  So that's my humble opinion of Rush's latest offering.  If you love this band, you already own this anyway, I'm guessing.  So all I can say is:  Not in the Rock `n' Roll Hall of Fame??  Are you kidding me!?!?!
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is so awful that I feel compelled to rate it, because it gets too many \\"5-star\\" reviews on Amazon, and I am deeply offended by that.  Are we that desperate for entertainment?  If I could give it zero stars, I would.  The reasons it is awful have already been covered in detail by many reviewers, and suffice it to say that a third-grader with only a single \\"60th Anniversary of Pearl Harbor\\" magazine article could have written a script that was more factually accurate and--yes--more entertaining.  Not even Shakespeare could fashion a tragedy as awful, complex, and heart-rendering as the actual story of Pearl Harbor.  Apparently Michael Bay et al., suffering delusions of grandeur, decided that they could improve the story...this travesty of a film is the result.  Sadly, too many people will watch the film and, not knowing any better, will assume that this is how it actually happened.  I am still angry that I spent money on the movie ticket.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Back in the early 2000's I was a hug fan of John Grisham.  I would read each and every single book within weeks of it being released.  After being disappointed with several of the books (King of Torts, The Last Juror, The Brethern, etc)... I took a break from his books.  When I first heard of this book, I was curious, something about the storyline -- the lawyers Finley & Figg are matached up with a new young lawyer Zinc who stumbles into their firm -- the book has it's funny, thrilling and exciting moments.  He goes back to his roots, back to his beginnings.  Definitely a book to buy!

B000SEIK2S|3.0|While I was quite excited to read this book after browsing the sample, I was ultimately disappointed by the light story and lack of character development.    John Scalzi clearly possesses an impressive imagination in creating a future world where humanity colonizes the universe and interacts with alien species.  The most apt description I could give this book, however, would be to call it a fictional military account set in the future.  It reads very much like non-fictional military accounts I have read, and I'm sure this was intentional.    Scalzi does a good job of writing action scenes (closer to hollywood/rambo style than real military action) and creating a universe for the characters to live in.  I appreciated the thought that went into the different alien species, the weapons systems, the ships, etc.    Despite this, Scalzi fails to create strong characters that the reader wants to care about, and problems with the plot make the book feel lightweight.  Friends of the protagonist die throughout the book in many different and violent ways, but, to be honest, I never felt any sort of loss or remorse.  Aside from the protagonist and perhaps one secondary character, all the characters feel very two dimensional.  All of the protagonist's friends are characterized as wise-crackers with nearly every other line being a sarcastic joke.  Military leaders (the drill instructor in particular) are nearly all perfect stereotypes.  The plot is not character driven, with everything that happens coming from exterior events beyond the protagonist's control.  Since the book was written in a military account style, most battles feel episodic and really add nothing to the plot of the book.  It is only in the last third of the book that we are shown what the climax of the book will be.  Even with this climax, there is no real development of the main character.    It is a shame that this book did not contain more character development or have a more developed plot.  I really wantedto like this book, but, in the end, it read as a very lightweight piece of military science fiction.  If you can get it for free and don't have high expectations, this book could be worth a read; just don't expect anything special.    Additionally, I would like to point out that this book does contain both significant language (including many f-bombs) and a fairly graphic sex scene.  Since this is military science fiction, these elements may not be much of a surprise, but many readers may be disappointed (as I was) by such lewd content.  It bears mentioning that this book's sexual content adds nothing to the plot and may have been added to make up for the lack of genuine emotional intimacy between the characters.
B004HW7JMY|4.0|I purchased Spartacus on Blu-ray as a Christmas gift.  The item came packaged well and on time.  Haven't had any problems with any of the discs.  Purchased from Amazon because the price was cheaper.
B003LXXEFG|5.0|Robert Smith and The Cure are one of the most influential bands of the post classic rock era IMO. Not in that super obvious way like Zep or Sabbath (and not to that caliber either), but it is there. The single melody song builds, the mysterious tones and arrangements, the dark pop overtones...simply brilliant. From Tool to the Surfers to Artic Monkeys, plenty of bands pay homage to the Cure in one way or another. This album marked, for me at least, their last gasp of greatness before entering into what i consider to be something of a musical decline. Fascination Street (rumored to be about Jack the Ripper) in particular will go down as one of the all time greatest songs recorded. Anyway, i am uncertain if i can hear a difference with the remastering or not, since i dont have anything to compare it with, but this is a great album, and if you arent already familiar with it, you owe yourself a listen.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />p.s. This was also a great tour. I remember the show well, even though i was in my mid teens at the time.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I LOVE this app. I don't care that it isn't updated yet, but it is so awesome. I beat it pretty quick, but I just got my. kindle fire and never stopped using it. well worth my .99&cent;

B004EBZX6W|5.0|If you have a wifi device, you really need this app.  This is very well made and very useful.  Since it is free to try, go ahead and try it.  You will not be disappointed.
0061906220|5.0|This is an all-time favorite w/ my 18 months and 4 year old.  We were introduced to this book via toddler time at our local library.    All the children were riveted and a waiting list ensued to check out the book!!!    Since then, I've been asked to read this book at least twice a day by my kids.... The free audio download is also very much appreciated.    A must have in your toddlers' library!!
B0012OLELM|4.0|It's not going to replace a real macro lens, but it's fun to use. However, I was disappointed that the fit is not really that universal. It'll not clip onto my 49mm lenses because it's 49mm as well...  I was hoping to use it with my Pentax f2.8 40mm pancake and f2.4 35mm, but it just won't fit. Thus, I can only use it on my kit and zoom lenses which require good lighting condition to produce decent results.
B0045NXMMQ|5.0|This film is a tour de force of casting and directing.  The locations and the shot compositions are key elements in conveying the spirit of the film, and the ingenuity of the characters in implementing their schemes of revenge is delightful.  The disc I viewed includes extensive behind-the-scenes coverage of the film's shooting.  I was surprised that the film company apparently did not obtain control of the streets in which it shot and had to cope with casual onlookers as best it could.  Maybe this is the French way.  Also, I'm not sure whether the lady contortionist's flexibility is a convincingly seamless use of CGI or is real.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this app is kind of fun when yoir bored because you have a lot of space to write things and I like to write stories when I'm bored so this is good for writing :)
0307946711|1.0|My friend told me I had to read this book that it was so could so I brought it on vacation. What a waste of time!!! This book reminded me of The Time Travelers Wife in a way...as we hoped for these two to find each other one day. However this plot was thin and way too drawn out. I found myself skipping chapters because I could not stand 1 more minute of dexter's partying or emma's misery. I would not reccomend this book. Just not worth them time.

B004XDYJRU|4.0|For any fan of talk radio like myself I find having this on my tablet as job one.  Actually the first thing I do with my coffee in the morning is fire this one up to listen to the Wall Street Journal This Morning.  At that time of day this capabililty is indispensible since the station skips over me and can't be heard over a normal over the air radio.  With this on your tablet you can find a choice as the station you'd like to hear just about any show you could imagine on radio including archived ones.  It is the first App I look for to put on a device.  I have to say that it gets only a 4 star because for the life of me I can't figure out how to make and then use a recording (which it will also do if you like).  But how to play it back baffles me...the instructions make little sense and I've never been able to make it work but oh yes, I've tried :)

I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I was drawn onto the story and couldn't wait to read what would happen next! Hoping she writes more books! Enjoyed her style of writing!
B0062A605G|5.0|I'm only 22 years old but I've always been a Betty Wright fan. No Pain, No Gain & After the Pain are 2 of my all-time favorite songs. So when she teamed up with the legendary The Roots, I thought I'd give the new album a spin... BOY AM I GLAD I DID!<br /><br />This album is AMAZING from start to finish! Betty's voice hasn't changed at all: STILL amazing. Combine that with great lyrics, amazing beats, and the same soul-filled belting of notes and you get another classic Betty album.<br /><br />Definitely worth the money!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Kindle Fire app. Works great. Easy, one-touch, &amp; at-a-glance weather check. Lots of additional forecast info. well delivered. I reccomend this to anyone who wants to check the forecast.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|My husband and I have enjoyed all the movies in the Fast & Furious series, but this one might just be our favorite. Timeline-wise, it falls after Fast & Furious (#4) but before Tokyo Drift (#3). In my opinion, it revived the series in a fun way and makes me look forward to more in the series. The stunts (while perhaps far-fetched) were done very believable, with little CGI, making the viewing experience very enjoyable. The storyline didn't bore you, and watching Vin Diesel fight the Rock was just plain fun! If you're not a fan of the other movies, you probably won't like this one. However, some friends of our had never seen any of them and watched this with us and now want to watch the whole series.

B0063T12RM|5.0|Philippina \\"Pina\\" Bausch [1](27 July 1940 - 30 June 2009) was a German performer of modern dance, choreographer, dance teacher and ballet director. With her unique style, a blend of movements, sounds and prominent stage sets, and with her elaborate cooperation with performers during the composition of a piece (a style now known as Tanztheater), she became a leading influence since the 1970s in the world of modern dance
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Viktor Frankl was one of the greatest psychologists and noblest human beings of the 20th century.  He taught that the primary motivation in human life was the search for meaning.  He explained that \\"the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day, and from hour to hour.  What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment.\\"  There is potential meaning to be fulfilled in every situation in life, no matter how painful and difficult it may be.  During World War II Viktor Frankl and his family were imprisoned in the Nazi death camps; his pregnant wife was murdered in the gas chambers and his parents died of starvation and illness.  Frankl miraculously survived and after the war wrote about his experiences and conclusions about human nature in his book \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\"<br /><br />Frankl asserted that man is free to make choices and determine his life and that is a much needed refresher in our age, when many perceive people to be simply subjects to biological, psychological, and social conditions.  Frankl says:  \\"Man does not simply exist, but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment...  In the concentration camps, for example, in this living laboratory and on this testing ground we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behaved like saints.  Man has both potentialities within himself; which one is actualized depends on decisions and not on conditions.\\"  He clarifies that although man is not free from conditions, he is free to take a position toward those conditions.  Our power and responsibility is to give meaning to our unique lives and fulfill that meaning, no matter what the conditions are.<br /><br />There are certain achievements that have the potential to greatly impact all of humanity; I believe that Viktor Frankl's ideas represent such an achievement and should not be limited to the realm of psychotherapy.  They were tested during the darkest hour of human history and after passing such a test, they are no longer \\"ideas\\" but rather facts about human nature, facts that we all need to consider as we face the challenges of our times and in our personal lives.<br /><br />Roumen Bezergianov, author of \\"Character Education with Chess\\"lm of psychotherapy.  They were tested during the darkest hour of human history and after passing such a test, they are no longer \\"ideas\\" but rather facts about human nature, facts that we all need to consider as we face the challenges of our times and in our personal lives.<br /><br />Roumen Bezergianov, author of \\"Character Education with Chess\\"

0312641893|5.0|I really, really, liked this one. A lot.  I must point out that this is a science fiction book filled with the gizmos and jargon one would expect from a science fiction story, but the terminology never gets overwhelming.  Meyer has done an excellent job of creating a fully realized futuristic culture and society that's still, in my opinion, accessible to readers who aren't accustomed to the genre.<br /><br />Normally I'm excited when I find out a book will be part of a series.  It gives me more time with a world and characters that I've come to enjoy.  Not this time.  This time I really wanted it to be a standalone so that Kai and Cinder would get the HEA that the original fairytale promises.  But no, Meyer gives us a killer cliffhanger that has me on pins and needles for book #2.  Rest assured, it's not one of those useless cliff hangers that irritate you and drag out the story.  No, this is a cliffhanger that makes you yell at the book, despair for your characters, and start stalking the author's blog for any hints or reassuring snippets regarding the sequel.  And then you look at the titles of the following books, and GASP, you might have to wait on that Kai/Cinder HEA, but oh boy what is she going to do with those other fairytales?  And then I had no choice but to squee an embarrassingly big fangirl squee.<br /><br />Cinder reminded me a lot of Firefly.  Meyer created an intriguing mix of future technology mixed with Asian culture and an enjoyable dose of drama.  There are hover cars, robots, cyborgs, illegal Lunar aliens, class warfare, a lost princess, a scarred princess, an evil moon queen, a mysterious illness, a draft to use cyborgs as medical test subjects, and war looming on the horizon.  It's quite the space opera, but toned down by the injustice the Cinder and the other cyborgs live under as well as the \\"realness\\" of the hero and heroine.  Cinder has survived so much and has become so strong as a person, she will be doing her own saving, thank you very much.  (I think she might turn into quite the badass by the end of the series.)  Kai is handsome, charming, and intelligent.  He's very aware that following his heart could drag his country into a brutal war that they would lose.  His choices are few and break his heart, but he will do what's best for his people.  These two have a lot to work out, but you can't help but want them to get their Happily Ever After.<br /><br />I realize that science fiction might not be for everyone, and this is not a light and fluffy sci-fi book.  However, I think that the familiarity of the Cinderella story will help those new to the genre navigate Meyer's excellent futuristic world. Cinder pulls you in and forges an emotional connection with the reader making it a difficult book to put down.<br /><br />Featured at an Abundance of Books, read full review here - [...]k she might turn into quite the badass by the end of the series.)

B000W91RUG|5.0|I have to admit that I didn't like it at first.  As someone who has a Ph.D. and am doing research (cancer biology), I first felt the show was a little stereotypical in depicting nerds, like how they dress, how they talk and how they act.  I have spent the past 13 years in research, first in graduate school, then as a post-doctoral fellow in science departments.  These are the same positions held by characters in the show.  I have never, ever, ever met anyone who dress, talk and act like those depicted in the show.  All of us dress, talk and act like everyone else.  We went to a bar one night in Long Beach when we attended a Biophysical Society conference there.  People were shocked when they found out that we were a whole bunch of \\"doctors\\" at the end of the night.  They thought we were some average college kids in Long Beach for the Spring break.  THEN I saw the light!!  After watching the show for several episodes, I finally saw through what is on the surface and understood the show.  The characters are saying what we think in our heads and are doing what we wish we had the courage to do.  Now I love the show and have watched every episode.  I think someone here on Amazon mentioned that many of the jokes need to be appreciated only if you have the background in science and engineering.  I certainly agree with this assessment.  With my science background, I can certainly appreciate the paradox and sarcasm in the show, especially when the characters are talking or arguing about some completely absurd theories while managing to hold a straight face.  I know only people like me would be able to understand the sarcasm in it.  Great show!

0385533829|5.0|We bought this book for my brother-in-law for christmas and I was pretty jealous giving it to him because this special edition was way better than our hard back book we have.  The story itself is so good and keeps you engaged the whole time, it is a pretty intense read, if you love action you will love this book!  I highly suggest purchesing the special edition over the regular book because the pictures give you greater insight as to where they are and what symbology they are talking about.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Nice for a free app but it does have a little learning curve so don't go into it thinking its a one touch do all miracle tool. pay attention to where its saving the file to on your unit.  stuff can get lost easily. All in all its decent...that's it. it does a nice decent job of snatching YouTube vids. would I pay? never.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely. It topped X-Men: First Class for my favorite summer movie of 2011. The acting was good, and story stellar. The expressions and actions by the ape were very fluid and life-like. Comparing this to the original series of movies, it is a definite step up. I think it works well into the overall storyline of Planet of the Apes, and can't wait for a sequal!
0062011847|2.0|I too am an enthusiastic Discworld fan, and particularly like Sam Vimes. I anxiously awaited the release of this book, as I had read all the others (some of them twice)and was very disappointed. There is way more \\"social criticism\\" and way less humor in this book. I have been having a hard time picking it back up, and have yet to finish it (I downloaded it the day it came out). Previous Discworld books have been just the opposite - hard to put down, and too soon finished.<br />I have been sad to see this happen to other favorite authors, from Michael Connelly to Tony Hillerman.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This case was exactly what I needed.  It was fairly light way, durable, and even had the ability for the cover to fold, so I can lean it up if I wanted to.  I like the strap that wraps around it to keep it closed at all times.  What is a bit disappointed is the finger prints that are left behind on the case.  If you take good care of your case and wipe it off with a cloth, it's as good as new.  I am very happy with my case and I have had it for about 2-3 months now.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|Purchased the pink case. I'm happy with its functionality. The stand is actually pretty sturdy despite how light weight it is. The only problem, which isn't technically a problem is that the case is more of a fuchsia. Rather than looking at the colors in the picture, the color is much more similar to the color in the swatch box.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Jason Bourne goes all-out in this film, and finally discovers why he's a deadly Frenchman. From Berlin to Moscow, then Tangier, back to London and even Madrid, Bourne tells it like it is. It is quite surprising that he didn't cross paths with MICHAELmATICIAN (often in Algiers). Bourne spends a few nights on Coke binges and other nights trying to uncover the conspiracy that created him and his new identity.<br /><br />This is a film of boundless action and international intrigue, it is the stuff that nightmares are made of. Director Paul Bluegrass does a superb job of delivering a gritty yet concise view of a world divided by borders and McDonalds franchises covered in blood. Jason Bourne has no problem overcoming trained assassins and mercenaries, but continues to struggle with cell phone reception. The pacing is such that Bourne hasn't a chance to eat, sleep or shave. This film is a must see for the citizens of Algeria.<br /><br />2.342
B005K17RU0|5.0|Better than apps on my iphone for weather, easy to read, all info on one screen for each day,map is good also
B0042AEOG0|1.0|mariah plays her role as the whore of babylon very well on this album well she's always done that anyway listening to this xmas filth will make you wanna sacrifice rabbits.
0140714855|4.0|Got my book before the date it was supposed to be delivered, which is earlier than I expected AND also a plus because I like getting surprised like that. The book was a little worn and the person who last had it drew doodles on the pages but thankfully it's in pencil so I can erase all the markings. Besides that, the book is in good shape and it is readable.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is not the best but it does keep me entertained at times. I would recommend. it to friends
B0054JZC6E|5.0|excellent game, although you do have to unlock the rest of the games by earning points that you get by the scores you get in the game.still it is a great game that includes arcade like games.

0385534639|1.0|This book was selected to read as a book club.  I was very disappointed and couldn't even get through the book.  Actually threw it out....not even worth giving to another person to read.
B0000047CX|5.0|I never tire of this recording. There are three great artists complemented by the natural talents of Astrud.  Getz's playing was never better--before or after.  I like to think that his playing was informed by true love.   (Getz & Astrud had an affair during the recording.)
B0053O89KG|5.0|My wife and enjoy the Castle mysterys. The Writer and the Lady police detective play at or should I say off each other.  The romance seems to run hot and cold, but it is cleverly done.I ha_ve purchased the two first years and have ordered this years already.
B006PAZMMK|5.0|This is seriously SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO worth spending 6.99 for. His music is worth all the money in the world because he is an amazing artist. I know in the future he will be a top selling artist, he just needs to get there. This made my day when I saw that his music came out and I had to go and buy it. If your a skrillex fan then you need to buy this album but If your looking for some new music to listen to then get this because it is so good. Dubstep is a great way to express your feeling through music.:)
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|est movie ever. this is a must buy. you may never heard of this movie but beware the dvd case is super flimsty made of super cheap black plastic
B0018O4YT0|5.0|I have the 1998 theatrical release of Dark City by New Line Productions which includes both widescreen and fullscreen versions to compare to this edit by Alex Proyas.<br /><br />I must say the Director's Cut is by far the better film. That silly introduction monologue is discarded which makes for a better experience. There are small scene changes that add depth to the characters which are okay but, only because the changes are subtile. The extras such as Proyas giving the play-by-play on why he made the changes is cool (I like that stuff). The expanded Roger Ebert commentary is nice and should be listened too. And of course there is a Gallery & Theatrical Trailer.<br /><br />For the collector this is a must have DVD. I cannot assume everyone has seen this film in any released version; so, it is my opinion that Dark City: Director's Cut is the first time viewers best choice; then try the hollywood movie house release.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I, for 1 am pretty much over vampire movies.  I have seen at least 10 different ones and can't say I really enjoyed any of them.  The constant straying from traditional vampire lore and the lack of a truly original story is the main reason for my lack of interest. It seems they always try to modernize, stylize, or change the principals and abilities of vampires to make up for a total lack of an original story line. They spend more time making the vampires \\"cool\\", social butterflies or overly vicious. Very non-traditional!  This is the ONLY vampire movie I truly enjoyed.  Even with the voice over, it is a huge step above any other vampire movie I have ever seen.  A very original story, it sticks to traditional vampire customs, and has just enough violence without making it a gore-fest.  In my opinion, it is exactly what it says on the cover review, \\"The best vampire movie ever\\". Hands down.

B002ZG97EC|5.0|FYI - the digital copy disc \\"expired\\" on 12/31/2011, so you won't be able to download it anymore. That must be the reason for the drop in price, but it's still a good deal for a DVD & Blu Ray movie.
0439023521|5.0|I can't believe how simply incredible this book was!  I read it within a few hours simply because I couldn't put it down!  As soon as I finished, I knew that I needed the next two books as soon as possible!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'd heard about this series, but hadn't gotten around to reading it.  I'm so glad that I did.  The story is set up beautifully, told in great detail and leaves you wanting for more (which is perfect since the trilogy is complete).  This was a great introduction to Katniss, Peeta and the other main characters and the characters are well developed throughout the book.  Very well written!
B000M4RG42|2.0|i just got it and i was playing it and it skipped and screen got cube like at 24 minutes and ten seconds also the cover is cheap flimsy plastic. i know from is always flimsy but were DVD goes  plastic is flimsy. i reccomended but be warned DVD case is flimsy and dvd may skip a couple times.  and a great education movie. itr best movie ever put into heart of the action
0307959856|3.0|I consider it more than a bit perplexing when an author begins their book with an apology. In this case, it is to author Jane Austen for using her characters. Since DEATH COMES TO PEMBERLEY is a sequel to Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, it is like apologizing for snow being cold. If you are going to write a sequel to a classic of world literature, it is, what it is. Don't apologize for it. It really puts me off my reading game from the get go.<br /><br />Okay, I got that off my chest, so now on to more pleasant topics - the fact that the venerable mystery writer P. D. James has taken up her pen inspired by my, and her, favorite author and whipped up a murder mystery for me do devour is delightful. What Janeite in their right mind is not salivating at the thought of an Austen sequel written by such an acclaimed and exalted author? Just the thought of Austen and mystery in one sentence pushes me into the giddy zone. To say that my \\"wishes and hopes might be fixed\\" in anticipation is an understatement.<br /><br />It is six years since the happy day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters in marriage: Jane to Charles Bingley and Elizabeth to Fitzwilliam Darcy. Both sisters and their husbands are at Pemberley, the palatial country estate of the Darcys in Derbyshire, whose grandeur is only equal to the ten thousand a year that it generates for its previously haughty master and decidedly opinionated mistress. Elizabeth has settled in as chatelaine to a large estate and mother to two young sons. Life is orderly and good at Pemberley, as long as one stays out of the haunted woodland.<br /><br />Darcy's younger, and still unmarried, sister Georgiana is also in residence being courted by two beaux: her cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam, and the young, ambitious, but dishy attorney, Henry Alveston. All have gathered for Lady Anne's ball, an annual event in honor of Mr. Darcy's deceased mother's birthday. Many county families will be in attendance. On the eve of the grand event Mrs. Reynolds the housekeeper and the staff are busy preparing for the large formal gathering while the family dine and later meet in the music room. It is a windy, moonlit night, but Colonel Fitzwilliam takes his leave for his nightly exercise, a ride along the river. Later, many have said their goodnights and departed when Darcy is surprised by the sight of a carriage careening at full speed down the woodland road to Pemberley. The coach abruptly arrives depositing a frantic Lydia Wickham, Elizabeth's unruly younger sister on the doorstep. She is hysterical, shrieking, \\"Wickham's dead. Denny has shot him!\\"<br /><br />The Wickhams had been traveling to Pemberley with friend Captain Denny by carriage. Even though Mr. Wickham would never be admitted to Pemberley because of his past indiscretion with Georgiana, Lydia, uninvited, had still planned to crash the party. Wickham and Denny had quarreled while traveling through the woodland, departed from the carriage, and gun shots heard soon after. Off into the haunted woods go the search party of Darcy, Alveston and Col. Fitzwilliam to discover a body in the woodland that Lydia is certain is her husband.<br /><br />\\"And now the glade was before them. Passing slowly, almost in awe, between two of the slender trunks, they stood as if physically rooted, speechless with horror. Before them, it stark colours a brutal contrast to the muted light, was a tableau of death. No one spoke. They moved slowly forward as one, all three holding their lanterns high; their strong beams, outshining the gentle radiance of the moon, intensified the bright red of the officer's tunic and the ghastly blood-smeared face and mad glaring eyes turned toward them.\\" p. 65<br /><br />A murder in the haunted woodland. The investigation begins. The body is removed to Pemberley. Mr. Darcy notifies the local magistrate, Sir Selwyn Hardcastle, who arrives to conduct the inquiries. Darcy, Elizabeth, Jane and Bingley are all distraught by theshocking death. The staff is terrified that the curse of the Darcys continues in the haunted woodland. Lydia is hysterical. Lady Anne's ball is canceled. The official inquest begins. Why did Colonel Fitzwilliam leave Pemberley to ride in terrible weather so late at night? What is the secret behind the Bidwell family who lives in the woodland cottage where Darcy's great-grandfather committed suicide? Who, or what, is the shrouded figure who haunts the woodland? What is the motive for murder?<br /><br />We are happily reunited with many of the characters from the beloved original novel and deposited at Pemberley, quite possibly the pinnacle of the Janeite world. Real comfort food for Austen fans. The first twenty page of the prologue recap the plot and details in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Was this for the benefit of her mystery readers who have not read P&P? If so, the same effect could have been achieved by working it into the narrative in a more creative way. James continues building the mystery slowly by adding in elements of the haunted woodland, the curse, and the ghostly figures reminiscent of a Grimm's fairytale. The plot ponders along with occasional bits of excitement from that evergreen drama queen, Lydia Wickham, nee Bennet, whose character she hits spot on. Another character who she develops interestingly is Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was the second son of an earl in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, and we all know that second sons must make their own way in the world. He chose the army. His life changes drastically, and his personality, when his brother dies and he becomes heir to a grand estate. He courts Georgiana, but don't look for much romance in this novel. It is a mystery and her romantic triangle is second fiddle to the murder investigation. Darcy and Elizabeth are, well, an old married couple and not as interesting as the proud and prejudiced characters that Jane Austen presented. I missed their witty banter.<br /><br />For Austen fans this will be an enjoyable, is somewhat ponderous, read if you overlook some of the annoying errors in continuity, and for mystery enthusiasts, James does spin a clever tale with a surprise ending that comes out of nowhere. Combined, the Austen and mystery elements do not play out to their potential. None-the-less, it is still an interesting read that has wrangled its way up the bestseller lists. That is an incredible achievement and great proof that the Austen brand continues to grow.<br /><br />Laurel Ann, AustenproseDarcys continues in the haunted woodland. Lydia is hysterical.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible app is awesome. I use it in Church and am able to look up passages at a much quicker pace. I enjoy comparing translations on the fly. I love this app.
B005R32L66|4.0|Both my kids have iPhones.  At Christmas, one was here and the other one was home.  They set up a video conference and we shared opening presents.  This was tres cool.  After Christmas, I purchased a new Samsung Galaxy Nexus Android to replace my ancient RIM Blackberry.  I discovered that the iPhone \\"Facetime\\" app doesn't exist on the Android.  So I installed Skype (and had my kids do the same).  Connected up with my son yesterday for a 1/2 hour conversation.  Very cool!  I only gave it 4 stars because  1) The picture quality is lousy compared to Facetime (perhaps this was his G3 vs my G4)  2) The picture only goes one way (sideways) as opposed to Facetime which auto-reorients the screen based on how you hold the phone  3) The picture is tiny (1.5\\"x1.5\\") as opposed to full-screen like Facetime and, lastly,  4) It was awkward to get going.  We spent quite some time fooling around before we finally connected (and I had to remove the battery from my Android).  I finally connected with his phone via my PC (where I also have Skype installed).  Then, disconnected and was able to connect phone-to-phone (Android to iPhone).  I assume that now we've connected, future connections will be smoother.  We'll see.  But, all that said, it's great to be able to SEE the person on the other end.  AND, Skype's app is free.  So how can I complain?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun app. glad I got it. it is free, and addicting. I have it on my kindle fire and my ipod touch. I deff recommend u getting it .
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I use it on my fire and sync to gmail. Perfect! Easy to use interface. Seemless syncing with footless tasks.

B005FITIGO|4.0|The tale of a financial firm that screws up its gargantuan value, sells at a loss and leads America into the 2008 financial crisis. It's a lot more complicated than that in the film but I'm trying to simplify it. There's a very impressive cast set up with this film: Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Zachary Quinto, Paul Bettany, Stanley Tucci, Simon Baker and a cameo at the very end from Marcy McDonnel. Overall, they all deliver a very good or better presentation of their characters. Spacey is the worn out cynic who's too wrapped up in more personal matters to completely care; Moore and Baker play high up rivals trying to survive the fallout; Quinto is the young brain who first discovers the problem; and Irons is the highest of the high who comes down upon the company with a cold precision and dominant authority at the meetings. There's definitely some ethical choices being made here and for the most part the question is brought up as to whether the right thing is being done. There's also a strong showing of disconnectedness to humanity as these people toss around six figure salaries and much higher as if they were tossing about spare change. Junior types, when not wondering if their bosses really make $2M or more a year compared to their 100k+ salaries, wonder what the common people are doing since they have no clue what is going to happen. Few are sympathetic and some seem resentful that they're giving better credit lines to the masses yet being looked down upon for being greedy Wall Street types. There's some truth in most of the statements, especially if you're on that side of the fence. Math nerds will notice Tucci's error in the latter part of the film when he talks about his engineering gig. This film cost about $3.5M to make (most of the big name actors/actresses didn't work for much) and yielded a bit over $10M at the worldwide Box Office. It was first offered up at the January 2011 Sundance Film Festival. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus to A minus; GETS THE CORPORATE FEEL RIGHT: B plus A minus; SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CRISIS: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: January 2012. BEST DIALOGUE: Seth Bregman: Will? Will Emerson: Yeah? Seth Bregman: Did you really make two and half million bucks last year? Will Emerson: Yeah... I did. Peter Sullivan: What do you do with all that money? Will Emerson: I don't know really. It goes pretty quick. Will Emerson: Well the tax man takes half of it up front. So now you got what... million and a quarter. Mortgage grabs another 300K, I gave 150 to my parents to live off, so now you got what? Peter Sullivan: Eight hundred. Will Emerson: I bought two cars last year for 150 total. Probably another 100 eating... 25 on clothes, put 400 away for a rainy day... Seth Bregman: Smart. Will Emerson: And what's that? Peter Sullivan: 125 left. Will Emerson: I spent 76,520 dollars on booze, dancers, and w***es. Peter Sullivan: 76,520? Will Emerson: Yeah, kinda shocked me, although I was able to write most of it off as an entertainment expense! (rest cut off)
B001GWK2MC|1.0|My 3 year old got this as a Christmas present.  On the second day of playing in it, he popped it.  It's a huge hole right on the seam, so I don't think it's patchable! Don't waste your money!

B000062XGF|5.0|This is the DVD that I was looking for at a good price.  The DVD was delievered in a timely matter in good working order.
B0060ZJ74O|2.0|This movie was so much longer than it needed to be. I suggest reading the book and never wasting the time to watch the movie.
B005KELS6Q|4.0|I preordered a Kindle Touch, but as I realized once it arrived, I didn't have anything to put it in.  So for the first month I had it, I kept it in the original box.  That's a little awkward to carry around.  So when I saw this on Vine, I decided to get it, despite that it's pink.<br /><br />In short the product does what it's supposed to do.  The Kindle Touch fits inside it and is cushioned against damage.  Now since a Kindle Touch is at least a hundred bucks, I'm not putting this thing through a lot of torture tests, like having an elephant step on the case to see if the Kindle is destroyed.  (I assume it would be.)<br /><br />But the product does help insulate the Kindle from minor jarring and spilling and stuff like that.  I just wish they had offered it in the black or even the turquoise instead of pink.<br /><br />That is all.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games are so great on here.there fun and great.I play it all the time and it downloads fast. I. think every body should have this app.

B006MHWXMS|4.0|Five minutes into this I love it already. Google tasks is lacking in the recurring task aspects and this does that! The interface is very intuitive.  I can also move tasks between lists very easily. Only drawback I can find is the date is in European format. Might be a setting for that but haven't found it yet.
B004U52VPS|3.0|This product was just OK.  Kids lost interest in it very quickly.  Would recommend at a much lower price.  Wish it had a storage bag or something.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|i like it but i would love it if it were not too easy, you play against a smarter brain( computer) than a person but not too hard
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I don't really mind the ads.  It's not like I have to wait for them to cycle through or anything.  Plus the points build up very quickly, so that's not really a problem.  I enjoy playing these little games during times I am waiting on something like the doctor or whatever because it's no big deal to quit them.  They're just a cute little lite time-waster.  My two little caveats are that it doesn't give much in the way of game play instruction and that you have no option allowing you to stay in the same game without re-choosing it and clocking in to replay it every time.  However, they're not such big deals that they keep me from giving the game a 5 rating.  If you're looking for an intense gaming experience, pick something else.  The games here are just for quick action and light amusement.  Enjoy!
B003Y5H5AQ|2.0|Do not be fooled by thinking that Ultraviolet is a real digital copy. All you get to do is stream a copy of the movie from their site. It only works on your browser, so what is the point. In addition you have to have Silverlight installed, which is a crappy product that microsoft is dropping soon. They say you can \\"download\\" it. But all it does is put a silverlight file in a hidden location where it will then play from your hard drive instead of stream.   There is no ability to play it on Boxee Box or even Apple TV like you can with iTunes digital copies that many movies come with.   I hope the studios wise up a realize this is not what customers want.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|I had originally bought this for my 9-year-old and then a different one for my 4-year-old, but when I received both nerf guns, the packaging on this said 6+, and then other said 8+, so I traded and gave this to my 4-year-old.  Its fantastic fun.  We assembled it in no time, leaving off the butt of the stock, as adding that makes it too long for him.  He can load the clip, insert the clip, and cock and fire the nerf gun all on his own.  Its light weight makes it easy for him to pack and as he grows, we can add the butt end of the stock, which also holds 2 clips and upgrade his gun.  He has played with this everyday since Christmas.  I have to watch when he loads the clip, as it only holds 7 darts and if he tries to add 8, it will jam the gun, but otherwise no complaints at all.  I would recommend this to my friends for their kids.
B0052ZQMLO|3.0|Unfortunately as of Jan 2012 you can't change the default dictionary of the Kindle Fire making the dictionary incredibly hard to traverse. Hopefully at some point Amazon will fix the problem but at the moment you're better off giving this a miss
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|I have used this app in the past and it worked great but after upgrading to the Galaxy Nexus with android 4.0 and purchasing the full license my scans come out as a black page. It takes the photo well but when I hit the check mark to finish the job the file is saved as a blank black PDF or image. I paid for this and didn't get a single use out of it. Please fix it!!
B001DF68MA|4.0|My kids and I gave this to my husband for Christmas and at first he was hesitant about it...But now after using it a few times he LOVES it and really enjoys riding around and going to the park with our 22 mos. old.   The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it is definitely on the smaller side. After reading reviews about how small it was I was expecting small but when I opened the pkg it was even smaller than I had expected. I did put my son it in before we gave it to dad and he seemed large in the seat. The width of the seat was fine but my sons back went much higher than the back of the seat and his legs and feet just fit perfectly in the foot stirrups for now. He will soon out grow it though.   I am happy to see that it fits my husbands Specialized bike as well as my Marin bike. I wasn't sure if it would fit onto the bikes but it does! We do use it without the headrest piece and our son just grabs onto the inner parts of the handle bars while riding. We can always add the headrest if it's a longer ride.   Overall I chose this bike seat so that we could have our children sit in front of us and in case there is a fall it is easier to wrap your arms around them and protect them versus having a seat behind you and not being able to give any extra protection to your child.
B005B6L0NO|5.0|This is an excellent recording  of  Bieito's  Carmen (Barcelona 2010, live).  I  am no  regie fan, but I appreciate  good  theatre and  this  staging  is tremendously effective.  True,  this  production is  unusually violent and sexually explicit;  but  the singing- actors inhabit their parts, the  music and chorus are an integral part of the action,  the conducting first class.  There are  exciting  performances by all  principals - particularly  Alagna as Don José is superb - and  the  minimalistic sets  and  lighting are effective  . Most of the spoken recitatives are cut from this production  adding  in dramatic intensity.  The story is  unconventionally  set around  nineteen-seventy , in poverty-stricken  Southern Spain; all Carmen's associates are frankly criminal smuggling cars,  electronics, and hard drink/ drugs ;  It's a violent  world,  where Don José's colleagues are no  national army upright soldiers, but  mercenaries, under harsh  discipline in their camp and  behaving outrageously  off duty.  Our very first image of Don José  is when  he and Carmen catch  each other's  eye for the first time:  both seem transfixed.  In his first scene with Micaella,  while  singing of his mother and home  (and singing perfectly ) Alagna seems  already aware that  all that belongs to the past .  His lack of response to Micaelas's kiss  looks like honest lack of attraction, not repression:  this Don José  is reserved rather than sexually  repressed: he's  also  single-minded and absolute in his passions,  fatally combining this with the  potential  for violence in his character  (it's  past homicide, after all,  that brought him to the army).  Poplaskaya's Micaella is not the traditional innocent girl,  but  a woman set on winning her man  and - despite her uneven singing -her  interpretation  is convincing. While  Beatrice's Uria-Monzon  acting is wonderful, her  singing  is  less than ideal for Carmen - but seems  appropriate for this  older and rough-living woman.  Her passion for Don José seems genuine  (while it lasts) making his obsession with her all the more convincing .  Finally,  Erwin Schrott's Escamillo  is well sung  in a clever parody of this macho character: he is a beautiful  virile animal likely to attract Carmen, escaping from  José's  possessive passion.  Alagna's duet and fight  with Schrott and his  final confrontation with Monzon's Carmen  are particularly  memorable in itensity .    Although the newcomer to Bizet's opera  might enjoy more  a traditional  production  (eg  the MET Garanca-Alagna  DVD ),  this Carmen is a rare treat for those who  love opera  as lyrical  drama.

B004T5K3OK|1.0|I have used this app in the past and it works great. I bought a Galaxy Nexus with the new Android OS and my scans turn into a blank page. It takes a clear photo but when you hit the check mark to finish the scan it saves it as a solid black page.
B006C45CFG|1.0|I expected this to be bad, but it was terrible.  The cheesy premise would have been acceptable had it not been for a lack of plot.  Awful story telling.  Miserable acting.  There's no end to the things that were wrong with this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love.this app. I got it on my ipod but its way better here!!!!!!  :):):):)  thanks so much app creator people you're. the best.!!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I beat the first quell and loved it. I was excited to see this new one had come out, but was worried they wouldn't be able to make a game as good as the first. I was surprised at how new some of the puzzle mechanics were but that it kept to the same quality of puzzle. I highly recommend if you like relaxing puzzle games.
B0015DROBO|1.0|Okay, I tried. As an avid readers of mysteries, thrillers,etc. I couldn't freakin' wait to crack open (or turn on as in the case for a Kindle user) this book. I read the first 70 pages and said: \\"This is awful.\\" Clearly I'm in the minority. But if you, like me, began to doubt your literary taste because you couldn't plow past the first pages, then this review is to assure you that you aren't alone.
B006MHWXMS|2.0|Obviously this must be one of the most epic apps ever.  It accelerates you to .25c, or 167,653,800 mph!  (All effects of time dilation experienced are approximate).  In order for you to experience 31 days when actually 32 days have passed on earth -- i.e. the 32 days in January as reported by the app -- you would have to be moving at right around one quarter the speed of light!  Either that or the developer just hosed up the number of days in January, but I liked my version better.  Download it as the free app of the day if you want, or wait until someone reports that the developer fixed the issue.  Certainly don't pay money for it as-is.    I don't know what limitations the Kindle Fire specifically has, if any, in terms of authenticating google accounts, but I'd much rather authentication be handled by the AccountManager class than hand out my google username and password to an app.  (Yes, you can use an application specific password under 2 step authentication but using AccountManager is the preferred method in Android ... and it's a pain anyway.)  This is not the application you are looking for (right now).  Move along.
B0063IH60K|5.0|good ole fashioned solitaire. haven't had one problem. great for passing time. I find myself playing this quite often :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love an app that simply works the way it is supposed to work. Enjoy changing the design on the card backs when not winning. Highly recommend.
0547258305|5.0|Quite enjoyable and well written.  Never a dull moment and likeable characters.  Great read not just for young adults.  I loved this book so much, I got a hold of Kristin Cashore's next book, Fire, and am anxiously awaiting the third book.  Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have to say I thought this was more of a women's book when I initially heard about it.  I got the urge to read it for two reasons, first I had heard from a guy friend of mine the books were good and second I saw the trailer for the upcoming movie which seemed very interesting.  Needless to say I began reading the books.  Once I started I kept reading and reading.  I am not an overly fast reader, but with this series I read all three books in 4 days.  The books are a story of independence, adversity, love and hope.  I'm not one for sappy books/movies, but these books were not at all and they were truly excellent.  I loved the twists and turns of the plot right up to the end of the last book.  I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a wonderfully imaginative emotional creation.
B000F8O35U|1.0|I ordered a dvd on line because I couldn't find it in the store for my granddaughter. They said my purchase shipped but I could not track it or get in touch with them. They took my money however.I could not get in touch with them through Amazon, they said they had decided to leave Amazon. They were called 2012 NEXT ON LINE. I am frustrated hoping this will not lead to fraud on my account and I would like a refund. Fortunately a reputable seller got a dvd to me in time.
B00364K6YW|3.0|I purchased this restored edition of Pride and Prejudice because my original 2 disc set was scratched and wouldn't play.  While the restoration is quite nice, I hate that it plays the opening and end credits between episodes.  I know this was originally released as a mini-series, but my original DVD version played each episode back to back without interruption.  It allowed me to really get into it like a movie.  Now, I find myself hitting the fast forward after every hour of run time.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great app with beautiful music and pictures to melt away stress... Calming zen effect for your hectic day... Relax and unwind. Namaste!

B000J6I0PM|5.0|A must-have for the serious Foo connoisseur.  The six extra tracks are well worth the money.  No dissapointments here....Do a little extra web-surfing and pick up this gem!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This product is great for what it is a cover and protector for my kindle fire. I love the ease of it. Simple but strong. only wish it came in more colors (like purple). A must have if you have a kindle fire.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|If you like Nickelback, you will love this CD. Been playing it in my car (loud...LOL) over and over for the last month. If you don't own this CD yet.....you should!!!

B0044XV3QY|3.0|I was disappointed that no instructions were provided with this product to enable subtitles. I purchased this product as a Christmas present for a relative in Romania who is not familiar with the English language. While the movie is very well done, the lack of subtitles in Romania language (or even in the French language) was substantially less than satisfactory
1439153663|5.0|This book has been added to my list of favorites. The writing and story line are superb! I did not want the book to end. I thought about the characters for weeks after I finished the book.
B0012GMW7A|5.0|Excellent CD. Lots of New works by Cohen and some favorite older ones. Great variety in tempo. I could  listen to it all day!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is a game that I fell in love with the first time I saw it played! It is a cute little game in which the point is to get the candy to Om-Nom, the little green dude who eats only candy. You cut ropes securing the candy to a certain spot so you get to feed him the candy and get all three stars while you're at it. They give you things to help you, like bubbles that lift the candy up, air cushions that blow the candy, etc. And there are hinderances as well, like spiders that climb the ropes in certain levels to try and steal the candy, spikes that break the candy if they come into contact with it, etc. All in all, this is an AWESOME app and worth the .99 I paid for it five times over.
