B0002IVN9W|5.0|After hearing this album for the first time all I could say is wow.  Arcade Fire is something different.  It's gorgeous, emotional, catchy, symphonic music.  You'll want to space out to the beauty of it yet also get up and move around.
B000089QEN|5.0|Excellent adaptation of the sprawling Thackeray novel that features a charming performance from Natasha Little as the wonderfully despicable Rebecca Sharp, anti-heroine and social climber of Napoleonic England.  As many have noted, the first hour of this BBC series moves along a bit slowly, but that's only to be expected during the introductory hour in which we get to know our characters, settings and situations.<br /><br />Two anachronisms aside (the Strauss and the mention of Belgium), this Davies' helmed adaptation far exceeds the 2004 Focus production.  It's a fine adaptation that gets to the heart of the  novel, keeping all of the cynicism and most of the language Thackeray immortal work conveys.
B00005JNJT|4.0|I thought BATMAN BEGINS was a really good movie.  It explained why Bruce Wayne became Batman.  The stories of how Wayne's parents were killed from BATMAN and BATMAN FOREVER didn't really match up, though BATMAN (with Keaton) story was close.   <br />I thought Christian Bale did an outstanding job as Bruce Wayne and Batman.  I would have to say that Michael Keaton and Christian Bale were the two best guys to play Batman.  Val Kimler was alright.  I thought he played one of the best Doc Holiday in TOMBSTONE.  George Clooney wasn't that great of a Batman.  sorry George!   <br />The end of the movie was interesting.  It kind of leads into the other Batman movie with Michael Keaton.  In the movie, BATMAN BEGINS, it shows the murderer of Wayne's parents getting killed.  It's possible that there were two men responsible for killing Bruce Wayne's parents.  BATMAN BEGINS showed one of the killers and BATMAN (with Keaton) showed the other killer who turns out to be the Joker.  You can make your own guesses on that.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|After watching this film I was in a state of ambivalence the likes of which I had not seen in a long time.  Closer featured four actors at the top of their game, wonderful dialogue, a fairly downbeat ending (I rather like downbeat endings- they're so much more powerful than light and happy ones), some very amusing scenes, and a very novel approach to a relationship movie.  However, I did not like the film's structure, feeling that by flashing forward over so many months a lot was left off the table.  While I recognize that this tactic could be seen by some as adding to the narrative instead of detracting from it, I felt it was far more of a hindrance than a help.  Nonetheless, it was not the jumpy trajectory that really got to me, it was the fact that each one of the four main characters was a truly miserable person.  Although the characters start out as relative innocents, in a few scenes all of them have become in turn vapid, power-crazed, masochistic, obsessive, foul, cheating, and low.  At the end all four are despicable and not worthy of the audience's time.  Now this could still be a compelling picture and to some degree it is, but the movie is not really about their plummet to deplorability (indeed some of the characters begin that trip in the second sequence).  Instead of judging its characters the movie merely observes their interactions, and herein lies my principle complaint.  Was Closer boring?  No, not at all.  Was it involving, well-acted and well-directed?  Yes, absolutely.  Was it an enjoyable film? No, it was not, hence my two and a half star (out of four) rating.  If Amazon allowed me to give 3.5's this would have earned one, but I cannot award give Closer 4 stars in all good conscience.  **1/2
B00003RQNJ|5.0|When you see this movie there is a phrase that comes to your mind: Man, they don't do movies like this one anymore!. These are two bandidos that assault the same train twice in a row. The owner of the train puts a price to their head and sends the ultimate vigilante team to hunt down Sundance and his fella.    They get tired of being followed so they decide to go to another country, Bolivia. Once they get there accompanied with a beatiful woman they realize that maybe Bolivia is not the way they thought it would be.     What makes this movie so different from other westerns is its humor, including their infamous:    Cassidy: Manos a---, manos a---, manos arriba...  Sundance: They got them up! skip on down  C: Arriba!  S: Skip on down!!!  C: Todos ustedes arrsmense(sic) a la pared!  S: They're against the wall already!!!  C: Donde... ah, you're so damn smart, you read it!!!    If you speak spanish, this will be hilarious, man I laughed to tears in that scene. The movie has a lot of immortal lines that have been quoted by other users, so it would be a big mistake if you don't see this movie.    The DVD includes some really cool extras like interviews with the main actors, an audio commentary from director George Roy Hill and other fellas, the production notes, original trailers (thought they're not as silly as the ones included in The Seven Magnificent) and an alternative beginning! (It's the first time I see something like this). Definitively a must buy!.

Serj's lyrical ability really shows in this song. Very catchy <br /> <br />Cigaro: 6/10 This is my least favorite song on the CD, but its still really good, I don't think that this song fits the CD that much tho. <br /> <br />Radio/Video: 9.5/10 This song is awesome! I really like the reggae sound in it and the sweet accordian. <br /> <br />The Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song: 7/10 This song is a little too fast for me to understand. Its so crazy, I think that they mean This Song Makes Me Feel Like I'm On Cocaine for the name of this song. <br /> <br />Violent Pornography: 10/10 This song is crazy, insane and AMAZING! Extremely catchy. <br /> <br />QUESTION!: 9/10 This song is really good. This song relates more to Steel This Album more than any other System song. <br /> <br />Sad Statue: 11/10 This song ROCKS!! It is the most catchy song in the world. It has the coolest chorus out of any System song. <br /> <br />Old School Hollywood: 6/10 Weird song, doesn't fit the CD, stupid lyrics. <br /> <br />Lost in hollywood: 15/10 AMAZING!!!!!

0060764899|5.0|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the first of the seven Chronicles of Narnia by unequaled English author C.S. Lewis. These books are able to accomplish something that few other books in all of literature have been able to achieve. They are able to be at once great and entertaining literature as well as insightful and profound theology. They are fun and inspiring. Tolkien, Lewis's model McDonald, and a few others achieve some variation of it, but none quite like Lewis.<br /><br />The story unfolds with the four Pevensie children being sent to live with an eccentric old professor in the country, in order to be out of London during the bombing. The house turns out to be as interesting as the professor, and soon the kids find their way to an alternate world where some of the animals can talk and fairy-tales come to life. Not just the fun characters, either, but witches as well, in fact one has the land of Narnia under a spell where it's \\"always winter but never Christmas\\". The kids become the focal point for a classic good versus evil struggle, but with heavy though never pedantic theological lessons. And the king of Narnia, the lion who is the son of the Emperor-over-the-Sea, is just fantastic. Highly, highly recommended for kids and adults.
6305095442|5.0|EVIL DEAD 2 isn't so much a sequel but a remake.  Due to copyright restrictions or some other legalese, Sam Raimi wasn't allowed to use footage of the original Evil Dead, so it's almost like Ash is starting all over with his deadly confrontation in the woods.  This time it's only Ash and his girlfriend who stumble upon a deserted cabin and also upon the Book of the Dead.  Four other characters enter the picture, but it's really a tour de force for Bruce Campbell as Ash in this bloody, outrageously comic take off of horror films.  Utilizing excellent hand held camera work and some gross out effects, EVIL DEAD 2 is a non-stop onslaught of gore and comedy.  Watching Campbell battle his own possessed hand is outrageously brilliant, and Raimi's nod to other great directors like Alfred Hitchcock is marvelous.  Note the visuals when the characters eyes move in different directions at the same time, a device Hitch used in the explosive restaurant scene in THE BIRDS.  This is a marvelous cinematic homage to Hitch.  Don't focus on plot holes or cheesy effects where you can see the set crew in the background.  Bask in Campbell's over the top performance and just enjoy one of the most frenetically charged horror comedies of our time.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|\\"Napolean Dynamite\\" is one of those films you need to watch a few times to truly appreciate. A single viewing isn't enough to enjoy this film. You need to see it through once, than watch again. After that, you'll likely enjoy this film forever. <br /> <br />Perhaps what is so refreshing about this film is that it is a teen movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family. The story is fresh and real. One can easily relate to Napolean Dynamite, the lovable loner who is the title character and focal point of the film. You can just as easily relate to Pedro, the new kid in school who Napolean quickly befriends and who becomes an integral part of the plot. All of the characters, with their various personalities and behaviors add to the film. <br /> <br />In the end, you find yourself cheering for Napolean, Pedro, Deb, and the unpopular kids who are often ignored in the day-to-day life of teens. You can easily watch this film and look at the high school you attend or attended, finding each of these characters on campus. You can look around your neighborhood and find an Uncle Rico or a Kip.  <br /> <br />The film is a true delight and one that shouldn't just be rented, but purchased. It is destined to be a timeless cult-classic and one for the ages.

B00008J4P5|5.0|Despite the growing criticism The White Stripes were getting because Seven Nation Army was overplayed, Elephant is still one of my favorite albums. <br />   HOWEVER <br />   I do NOT think this album is perfect. Tracks like \\"Cold, Cold Night\\" and \\"I want to be the Boy\\" are quite boring, and i would have given this CD 4.5 stars if I could have. As this is, of course, not possible, the Stripes got the 5 on the basis that the lower quality songs were not an attempt to take the band mainstream. <br />   This being said, when Jack and Meg nail a song, they do it perfectly. Standout tracks include \\"Black Math\\" (my personal favourite) \\"There ain't no rom for you here\\", and all the other garage rock tracks. Strangely, I also liked \\"It's true that we love one another\\", which I somehow found to be kind of Beatle-esque (if there were girls in the Beatles) <br />  Another great disc from the Whites. Highly recommended.

B000002U9Y|2.0|What a mess.<br /><br />Syd Barrett was fast on the path to becoming an acid casualty, and his replacement, David Gilmour, was beginning to integrate with the band.  The original plan was for Barrett to still compose songs a la Brian Wilson and the rest of the band to bring his music to the world.  But Barrett was completely incapable of carrying on, and contributed only one song here (although he also performed on at least one other).  The band needed a solution.<br /><br />That solution largely came in the form of Roger Waters.  Grabbing the reins, Waters wrote about half the material on here-- while two of his compositions are largely derivative of Barrett's style-- opener \\"Let There Be More Light\\", probably significant only for unleashing David Gilmour's guitar playing on the world during his solo in the coda and \\"Corporal Clegg\\", significant only for being the first of his songs obsessed with war veterans, a theme he'd explore in depth.  But the third piece, \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" was something different.  Dark, meditative, driven by a haunting bassline, it really is the first sign of things to come for Waters-- dark, meditative, and downright attention-getting.<br /><br />The remainder of the material is a mixed bag-- an extended, unfocused instrumental suite (\\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\") and two Rick Wright originals (the decent \\"Remember a Day\\", featuring great slide guitar from Barrett and the downright awful \\"See Saw\\") and one Barrett composition (\\"Jugband Blues\\").  It is the Barrett piece that is notable-- conceivably the most bizarre piece he ever wrote (and thats saying something), it has an oddly confessional lyric showing that Barrett likely knew what was going on, at least to some degree, and a bridge featuring a small band playing whatever they want, per Barrett's instructions.  But for all this disjointness, it is without a doubt the highlight of the record.<br /><br />It's a noble effort, and its clear that the drive that would lead Waters down the path he would eventually walk was here, but this is more a curiosity than anything else.would lead Waters down the path he would eventually walk was here, but this is more a curiosity than anything else.
B00004XPP0|5.0|in this VHS box set are the three classic star wars movies that started it all. <br />episode IV a new hope <br />episode V the empire strikes back <br />episode VI return of the jedi <br />ok first of all, everyone complaines about how these movies really aren't the \\"original\\" version that were released in theaters(If you are really that concerned and want the original movies just buy them all seperately from amazon.com although it can be very expensive). The changes are not very noticable and are very minor. The only major change is when Han Solo and Greedo were talking and Han fired his blaster at Greedo. In the original movie, Greedo fired first. There have also been rumors that Hayden Christensen stars in this but I don't believe that. <br /> <br />This is a must have for any Star Wars fan. This are the REAL Star Wars movies. It simply doesn't get any better than this.  <br />
B000002U9W|2.0|1970.  Pink Floyd was having a rough time in the studio-- they'd honed themselves into a fine live act, and Roger Waters was developing as a songwriter, but as a band, they'd yet to accomplish a masterful studio album since the departure of Syd Barrett three years prior.  \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" was an attempt at something grand-- a sidelong suite performed with an orchestra and choir. <br /> <br />It was ambitious, and while such ambitious undertakings-- side-long suites, performing with an orchestra, etc. are often revered by fans, I've found that as time goes on, my expectations for such excursions gets higher.  In truth, \\"Atom Heart Mother\\", for me, takes advantage of neither the capabilities of an orchestra nor the band.  The arrangement is sparse, the band's performance is underdeveloped and as a whole, while the piece is not tortorous to listen to (I'll save that term for part of the second side), its pretty flat. <br /> <br />The second side is different-- four pieces, one each from Waters, David Gilmour, and Richard Wright, and a group composition.  Quite honestly, except for Waters, none of these guys were particularly accomplished songwriters and the material is a disaster-- instrumental \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" rambles on for 11 minutes without much point, and both Wright's and Gilmour's contributions are unessential in the band's canon (although \\"Fat Old Sun\\" would be a nice live vehicle).  The gem though is Waters' \\"If\\", a live feature now and again on his solo tours, its a simple acoustic song with a lovely electric lead from Gilmour and a really brilliant lyric (very little he's written, before or since is comparable with \\"if I were a good man, I'd understand the spaces between friends\\").  Its the gem of the album, not the extended and somewhat lifeless title cut. <br /> <br />In all, its probably not as bad an album as I make it out to be, but its certainly not a great one.  I give it two stars, quite a bit of that for sincerity of effort.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|this just basically kicks some major azz.not many bands can make a come back, record a new cd with new material with quality and something to say...just look at kiss. these guys are tight and they know how to write songs. there were only one or two weak songs...the lock ness song could have been shorter too but the overall felling is strong. rob h. still has the voice...there is no way motley crue or other comeback bands will be able to surpass this quality. they were great live too!!! they are true rock gods!!!
B000002UA5|3.0|Conceptually, one of the more interesting double albums ever released (and certainly wrapped in one of the best covers ever designed), Pink Floyd's \\"Ummagumma\\" consists of two very different discs-- the first, live versions of four older pieces, the second devotes roughly a quarter of each disc to solo material for each band member. <br /> <br />The live material shows how far Pink Floyd came in a short time as a live unit-- their performance is tight enough to maintain a strong focus, but loose enough to encourage Gilmour's technical strength and the inventiveness of the four musicians.  All four tracks are strong, in particular \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\\"-- a nearly forgotten about b-side, this is the definitive reading of it, dark, haunting and powerful, a great exposition of the sort of mood performance the band excelled at by this point in their career and really summarizes how they could take moderately interesting material (like 'Eugene' or \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\") and transform it into something quite amazing on-stage. <br /> <br />The second disc is a bit less exciting-- its pretty clear that only Waters was developed enough as a songwriter to pull off this sort of experiment-- \\"Grandchester Meadows\\" is a fantastic if a bit overlong acoustic guitar-driven song.  The succinctly titled \\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict\\" is, well, it should be heard.  After several minutes of animal choruses, Waters begins a rant in a Scottish accent that is just toally bizarre and unintelligible.  Like I said, its somethng that needs to be heard.  The rest is pretty uneven-- both Wright and Mason seem to pretty much go nowhere in their sections (Wright's in particular is pretty unexciting), Gilmour's comes in three parts-- the first two are pretty much a waste, a folky psychedelic piece followed by some metal riffing, but the third is the gem.  A nice electric rock piece (once it gets past its droning intro) evengets past its shaky vocal and ends up a decent pop song. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a pretty good recording, inconsistencies on the second half aside, the live disc is worth the price of the set anyway.
B000007U6V|5.0|I really believe that this has to be one of the greatest electronic albums ever made, and probably one of the best that Kraftwerk has ever done. The album was released in 1974, just about the same time Eno began his experiments with ambient music (No Pussyfooting), so it's a close call in relation to who exactly started messing with ambient music first. My only complaint is that it seems to have been mixed fairly poorly, I always find myself wishing that the drum track was a little louder.
B000002UA0|5.0|An artifact of its era and the only record of its kind, Pink Floyd's debut, \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\", is a far cry from the sort of material the band was known for.  The reason for this is quite simple, at this point, guitarist, vocalist and principle songwriter Syd Barrett was still leading the band, supported by Roger Waters (bass), Rick Wright (piano, organ), and Nick Mason (drums).  Barrett's stamp is all over the record, from his glistening guitar to his thoroughly British vocal to his bizarre visions of space, cats, gnomes, and scarecrows-- managing at the same time goofiness and depth and a punk-like earnestness and creativity. <br /> <br />What you'll find here is quite incredible-- Barrett's vision crosses pretty much the entirity of pop music at the time, from psychedelic rock (vocal-driven \\"Astronomy Domine\\", \\"Pow R. Toc H.\\", \\"Chapter 24\\") to Beatlesque pop (\\"Lucifer Sam\\", \\"Bike\\") to bizarre folky numbers (\\"The Gnome\\", \\"Scarecrow\\") and an extended, psychedlic instrumental brilliant in its simple descending riff (\\"Interstellar Overdrive\\").  In fact, about the only weak moment is Waters' first clumsy songwriting effort, the disasterous \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\".  Its a pretty harmless piece, but it pales in comparison to Barrett's work. <br /> <br />This was the only album of its kind because Barrett was destined to become an acid casualty-- he was slowly replaced the year following this album by David Gilmour (and appears on only parts of the followup, \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\").  Interested parties however are encouraged to check out Barrett's solo records, while he abandoned much of the overt psychedelic trappings and that made this album so great, even with his powers severely dimished, he was still a great pop song composer. <br /> <br />In short, don't come here looking for \\"Wish You Were Here\\" or \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\".  But once the shock of what this album isn't wears off, its clear this is a masterpiece in its own right.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I just got through viewing this DVD for the third time and I have to say I think it is one of the best depictions (of a stage musical to film) I've ever seen. <br /> <br />A lot of negative critique relayed towards \\"Phantom\\" seems to be related to the fact that \\"it isn't true to the stage musical.  Gerard Butler doesn't really sound like Michael Crawford, la la la...\\" <br /> <br />Ummm...I'm going to take a guess that these critics did not read the casting before they saw it and were thus disappointed? <br /> <br />\\"Phantom\\" is not meant to be an absolute re-creation of Crawford and Brightman's brilliant stage performances.  Anybody who went into the theatre expecting that was BOUND to be disappointed. <br /> <br />But there are some great perks to the film.  The introduction, where the raising of the chandelier corresponds with special effects to recreate the Opera Populaire in its heyday gave me goosebumps. <br /> <br />Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum have incredible chemistry.  In fact, my biggest problem was \\"accepting\\" the fact that Phantom is supposed to be a hideous deformed pyshopath (Butler is sinfully handsome, and no suspension of disbelief can change the fact.) Theirs is a more romantic and erotic depiction of the love triangle. <br /> <br />Butler's voice is rich and sensual, more geared towards a rock sound than Crawford's portrayal.  This makes it DIFFERENT, not necessarily BAD.  Rossum is a joy to hear.   <br /> <br />It was also refreshing to see Raul involved in some action scenes instead of his portrayal in the musical of a trust fund baby waiting for the opera star to hand herself to him on a plate. <br /> <br />I've seen the stage version twice, and was very pleased with the film.  It had enough originality and enhancement to make it grow beyond the stage piece.   <br /> <br />

My daughter, now 3 1/2 pulled this book off the book shelf, and asked me to read it to her.  She wanted me to read it every night for a week.  She likes to 'read' it to her teddy bear and her other 'friends'.  She likes the darn thing, so for her sake, I'm updating this review.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is truly a masterpiece by creator Joss Whedon. What was Fox thinking when they canceled the show?!!!!! After all the excellent reviews this show has gotten, and all those fans out there wanting more of it, hopefully we can see some more future episodes of this mesmorizing show. Perhaps a second season.
B0003V16XQ|1.0|'Nuff said. I don't think there's much left for me to say about this album that I haven't already said.
B0007O38F8|3.0|Im feelin the same way most of the listeners of \\"The Massacre\\" are feelin, it just is not livin up to the hype. I hate it how they pushed the album back and changed its name from \\"The Valentines Day Massacre\\", I thought that was a creative title. The CD is a big mix of tiresome songs, average songs, and bangers. Its TOO DAMN LONG also, there are 21 songs. <br /> <br />My Fav Tracks: <br /> <br />Piggy Bank   <br />Gatman and Robbin   <br />Outta Control   <br />Gunz Come Out   <br />My Toy Soldier   <br />Position of Power   <br />God Gave Me Style   <br /> <br />
B000001F3C|5.0|This is my favorite U2 album; I feel like it was made at the crossroads of their career; their songwriting skill had matured beyond the atmospheric feel of \\"October\\" (another album I love) but hadn't yet become big megastars. The songs are still more \\"raw\\" than \\"cooked\\" like they were to become in the 1990's when Bono seemed to become a lost, self-parody who's biggest talent was wearing sunglasses - what was that about?<br /><br />I'm not the only person who points out that \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\" is an underrated tune and, along with the tracks which make the \\"best of\\", part of the winning hand on this set. It was one of the first U2 songs I ever heard and immediately I knew there was something different about this band from the usual new-wave fare. It's something that hockey fans routinely call \\"heart\\" and, not to mix metaphors, but this song has it in spades. Bono sounds like he is standing on a mountain peak, shouting the words:<br /><br />I try to spit it out<br /><br />I try to explain<br /><br />The way I feel...oh, yeah, two hearts...<br /><br />The rhythm section is driving and Edge's guitar line is propulsive with a riff that constantly invades my memory. I don't know, maybe you had to be there...hard to believe that was 22 years ago and that I'm that old!
014028009X|5.0|Words cannot express our thanks to Bridget.  We love you and hope for another sequel.  We are dying for more.  And Mark Darcy had better be in it! <br /> <br />Ladies, if you have daughters that are in their 20's that might be lost - can't find their way, floundering through life - I highly recommend Bridget Jones.  I guarantee your daughters will be gratefully relieved to realize their lives are not all that bad and don't forget the second book too.  Make it a gift set!   <br /> <br />Personally I feel this should be a mandatory course for all teenagers just starting college.  Their in the same boat.
B00005JNJT|3.0|I went to see 'Batman Begins' last night so while it is fresh in my mind, let me tell you what I thought of it - <br /> <br />Firstly, the director Christopher Nolan's previous work included the excellent 'Memento' and 'Insomnia'.He seemed like a weird choice of director for a superhero/action movie. <br /> <br />However, after seeing this film, it's clear why he was chosen - this film is very analytical in it's detail.The first hour and a bit of the film goes to explain why Bruce Wayne took on the persona of Batman.This is the main problem with the film.It is very very boring for the first hour.He doesn't don the cape and mask until about 70 minutes into the film. <br /> <br />Personally I preferred Tim Burton's vision of Gotham City and Batman.Christopher Nolan is trying to bring reason and sense into the Batman story.There is NO NEED to go through the level of detail that he has done.An audience can accept that Batman is a superhero end of story. <br /> <br />I also didn't enjoy the baddies in this film.They are not spectacular enough. <br />Also Katy Holmes plays the District Attorney of Gotham City.This is bad casting.She looks like a lost little girl in the film.Michael Caine as Alfred is pretty wooden as well.He phones in a performance e.g. doesn't try too hard.The same goes for Morgan Freeman.The role doesn't stretch him too hard. <br />Christian Bale as Batman is a decent enough performance.He's a good actor. <br /> <br />Overall, it's not a bad film really but it's not spectacular enough.
B000683VI4|5.0|I found this movie very good. Yes there were some scenes but it has a strong story that made me laugh and cry. It made you sit at the edge of your seat everytime there was a climax and then a flashback to the present. I highly recomeed this movie but i don't think anyone under 13 should see it because of those 2 scenes.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Let's start by saying that I am a huge fan of comicbooks. HUGE!At age 40, I can say that I've been collecting them in one form or another since I was about 8-years old. 'Constantine' is based on a comic, albeit with a more mature them, and one that I have to say I've never read before. I think that's a good thing because I don't care to read about it. Besides, 'not' reading the book allowed me the oppotunity to see the movie for what it was. What 'Constantine' for me was a fun, sometimes creepy, sometimes campy film that I had a good time seeing. Yes, one could argue Keanu Reeves' acting prowess (or lack thereof), but the fact is it wasn't as bad as people say. The only real complaint I have is the role given to that 'Disney' kid- Shia Lebouf (sp) or whatever his name is. If I see him play the bumbling sidekick in one more movie I think I'll do myself in. Other than that, check your logic (and acting expectations, and religion) at the door and do try to have fun.
B0009F9O6W|2.0|thats not what i consider progressive rock or avantgarde.<BR>sorry guys, good luck for future release.
0375751513|5.0|No one really impresses me when it comes to Literature. Oscar Wilde, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, those are the great people of literature amongst thousand others.<br /><br />Dorian Gray is an amazing fascinating book. I finished the book in a day, it just trapped me into the plot and I couldn't sleep without knowing what would happen the next, the next, the next page. I think a good book does that to its reader.<br /><br />The language is very fanciful and the usage of profound words help me a lot to express my words too. it's quite poetic, and for the young readers like me, i think we like how cynical Lord Henry was, and how submissive Basil seemed to appear as. The characters found in the book, from Dorian to the unimportant drug dealers in the alley - they just make you engage in the plot of the story.<br /><br />everyone should read this book - it's a gem.
B0006L16N8|1.0|The Coldplay fan I am, I am seriously disappointed with this album.  I think the mainstream effect has gotten to the band.  Three years and they come out with this?  I will credit them with trying some new things but this album sounds a little repetitive at most points.  Same flows to most of the songs.  The lyrics in this album are just plain awful.  I don't know if Chris Martin was trying to hard to be poetic in every song but the lyrics just do not flow and for that I cannot really get into the songs.  I like \\"White Shadows\\" and \\"Twistic Logic\\" but that's about it.  \\"Fix You\\" and the song about his brother are terrible.  The second album was so good that I thought I may have over hyped this one too much.  Though I have listened to this album multiple times now and cannot get into it at all.  I can't imagine what they will put out for a second single.  \\"Speed of Sound\\" did not do much of anything for me either.  The piano was good though but that is the only song with a strong piano.  I truely hope Coldplay comes back with something better than this.  Chris Martin may have lost his motovation to write great songs with well a wife, a baby, and plenty of publicity.  The lyrics once again are just awful.  I can not say that enough.  Please come back with something better Coldplay.
B000086EOB|4.0|Vintage WASP!  Any heavy-metal fan has to have this.  Great stuff!  Love it!
B0007TKH66|5.0|Being a hardcore Star Trek fan since 2002, not as long as some of you, I was sorely disappointed when I found out I don't have UPN or no other channel that carried Enterprise, still don't. But salvation came when this DVD was released. I could finally see Enterprise and I have to agree with a lot of fans, this series was cancelled way before it's time.<br /><br />Star Trek Enterprise is a very interesting series that deals with how everything came into being, the first episode \\"Broken Bow\\" alone introduced how the transporter beamed its first person aboard a ship. The story is a refreshing throw back to the TOS era, seeing the return of some of the classic TOS props, but with a more updated look. To describe it, this is like TOS with a DS9 storyline. Very dark storyline with a few casual jokes thrown in, but when they do have jokes, they are hilarious! Watch Malcolm's fantasy about T'Pol on the episode \\"Shuttlepod One\\" for a great example, it is hilarious!<br /><br />The actors fit perfectly into their characters. Scott is Archer, Connor is Trip! They fit in so perfectly into their characters; I couldn't picture anyone else that could be cast in the role.<br /><br />Overall, this collection lived up to everything I hoped it would be, another great series that I can say that was definitely cancelled before it's time, and I heard it only gets better. After watching Season One, Star Trek Enterprise has become my favorite Trek series.  I sincerely can't wait until Season 2 comes out in a few weeks! Bravo Star Trek, you still haven't lost your touch-no matter if you are for at the moment not with us.
B0002858YS|4.0|Fab album, I bought it based on some of the reviews here and was not disappointed.  \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" is very reminiscent of The Smiths and \\"On Top\\" is also a great song which starts with this clubby type of beat, then changes into an off-kilter song which has great vocals.  This band is fab, and for anyone who loves the British indie style bands this is a must!
B0006L16N8|2.0|Man, call me nuts, but this album sounds just like the first one.... it's like: changhe the things a little bit and sell them the formula again.... <br /> <br />has catchy songs, but just because they seemed strangely familiar... <br /> <br />Radiohead should be named king, and maybe U2 in second.... <br /> <br />Coldplay, I don't know where to put them... at least now...
B0002OERI0|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Green Day, it's one of my favorite bands. I'm just saying that the lyrics are hardcore. More 'rock' than their past albums, but great lyrics and beats; addicting sonds; who could ask for more?
B000002GQE|5.0|Some people claim the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper as a groundbreaking rock album from the 60's, and they would be right.  I would like to point out, however, that there were other albums released at that time worthy of that description and, for me, Days of Future Passed is my personal Pepper.  From the very beginning where the  London Festival Orchestra introduces you to a montage of the arrangements awaiting you, you know that you're in for something very beautiful and unique.  Graeme Edge recites \\"The Day Begins\\" and then we are off to the races with Mike Pinder's \\"Dawn is a Feeling,\\" a lovely, slow and sleepy jazz ballad that mirrors somebody just awakening for the day ahead:  \\"Dawn is a feeling, a beautiful ceiling...This day will last a thousand years if you want it too.\\"<br /><br />Out into the morning we see the children playing in \\"Another Morning.\\"  This is one of my favorite of Ray Thomas's compositions as it trots along in a carefree childlike bounce, describing children kite flying and little girls with dolls.  One gets the distinct impression that an adult is going off to work and observing how \\"time seems to stand still in a child's world.\\"  The orchestra brings to life the sounds of wonderment and playfulness before sequeing into a somewhat corny showtune instrumental passage that sounds like busy traffic in the city.  One definitely feels the heat of an average, busy summer day.<br /><br />It's noon, and John Lodge presents us with a very Beach Boys sounding \\"Peak Hour,\\" right down to Justin Hayward's guitar solo and Mike Pinder's \\"groovy\\" surf keyboards.  Why is everyone so busy hurrying, Lodge asks?  \\"It makes me want to run out and tell them they've got time.\\"<br /><br />At last, there's time on this \\"Tuesday Afternoon,\\" one of the two hits penned by Justin Hayward off this amazing concept album.  This song so strongly captures the dreaminess and playfulness of time found to spend in the country, taking in nature and the realization that it often speaks to us without words.  It's also so cosmically hip with just the right balance that it hurts.  \\"The trees are drawing me near, I've got to find out why.  Those gentle voices I hear explain it all with a sigh.\\"  Here, too, is the lovely element of magic in the bridge which speaks about a \\"fairy-land of love.\\"  The longing for the afternoon to stay lingers with the orchestration again, but it must inevitably fade into evening now.<br /><br />\\"Evening--Time to Get Away:\\" Where one man enjoyed his Tuesday afternoon John Lodge takes the stance of another man who's finally leaving his job behind for the day.  \\"Toiling has bought too many tears,\\" he says, yet at the same time he recognizes \\"it doesn't really hurt you.\\" This song has long been a staple of album rock airplay together with \\"Tuesday Afternoon,\\" at least where I live.<br /><br />\\"The Sunset\\" takes on a somewhat primitive Eastern sound embellished by Ray Thomas's exotic, snakey flute as Mike Pinder pays tribute to the natural laws of the universe--day into night.  Then Ray Thomas breaks into Pinder's quieter ode with his cosmic rocker \\"Twilight Time\\" and some of his best lyrics:<br />\\"Building castles in the air<br />Whistling to the wind<br />As nature bows down her head<br />See what tomorrow brings<br />Twilight time, dream with me a while.\\"<br /><br />And now it's the blackness of night, the album ending with  one of the Moodies' most well-known songs about the longing of loss in love, Justin Hayward's \\"Nights in White Satin.\\"  I hated this song as a little girl because it was dark and creepy to me.  Now that I'm a lot older I see how beautiful the unrequited longing of it is.  The sheer aching and sophisticated  British splendor of this song are absolutely nothing without the huge ending most radio formats forsake--the gorgeous orchestration that leads into a favorite poem of mine recited by Graeme Edge, \\"Late Lament,\\" and how well it emphasizes the forlorn atmosphere of the night, as if to say there's company in Hayward's  downcast contemplations:<br />\\"Breathe deep the gathering gloom<br />Watch lights fade from every room<br />Bedsitter people look back and lament<br />Another day's useless energy spent<br />Impassioned lovers wrestle as one<br />Lonely man cries for love and has none<br />New mother picks up and suckles her son<br />Senior citizens wish they were young<br />Cold hearted orb that rules the night<br />Removes the colors from our sight<br />Red is grey and yellow white<br />But we decide which is right<br />And which is an illusion.\\"<br />Even after the gong that signifies the day's (and the album's end), the magical mood of this stunning opus stays just a while longer as you bask in the experience that has just hit you from end to end.  You probably can't feel what I'm feeling as I write this, but I can attest that DOFP is something spectacular almost 40 years after its release, and you will just have to hear it for yourself.  In fact, you have to buy it.  I consider this album among others I have on a list of those I regard as \\"prized possessions,\\" and it is also my favorite Moodies album.  Get this for yourself and see why I wish I could rate it as a 10.ring gloom  Watch lights fade from every room  Bedsitter people look back and lament  Another day's useless energy spent  Impassioned lovers wrestle as one  Lonely man cries for love and has none  New mother picks up and suckles her son  Senior citizens wish they were young  Cold hearted orb that rules the night  Removes the colors from our sight  Red is grey and yellow white  But we decide which is right  And which is an illusion.\\"  Even after the gong that signifies the day's (and the album's end), the magical mood of this stunning opus stays just a while longer as you bask in the experience that has just hit you from end to end.

0316172324|5.0|The capacity to assess situations or circumstances shrewdly!  That is merely the definition of judgement, right?   Well, the nudgers and whisperers of psychology will reluctantly agree that \\" Blink \\" contains the all the parts of life`s thought tapestry. Founded on the jaw-dropping studies of human reactions, while breath-takingly displaying the intricacies of the mind, Malcolm Gladwell begins to rout out how one`s sequence of thought works!  After studying how the journey through life is fraught with peril, he explains how we are under growing pressure to reach a conclusion.  Such is the devasting picture of Military, some may be trying their darndest to flog the one most likely to provide a soaring rise of defiance.  The luvvy intelligence of a man as vitriolic as Gladwell is worrying enough!  But the thinly veiled attack on Politics will surely unleash a foul-mouthed rant from some.  Still, it comes as little surprise that the rising tide of facts will underpin his argument, hence making the book enjoyable yet compelling.  With astonishing Biological savvy, including information about the real causes of heart attacks, this book will undoubtedly stand at the seemingly glittering summit of Psychology!  While some pick apart the wholly improper acts from authority, doctors are just as worthy the potshots!  Armed with Political genuis, threating a wide-spread revolution in society, the Messiah`s mutterings of slipshod work from the bureau might stun those who are easily offended.  Nevertheless, this book is fascinating!  If I had learnt so much, you will gain knowlegde in abundance, but you will still enjoy this piece of work.  I recommend this for everyone!!!
B0009IW9DE|5.0|Make sure you look up the reviews for the original version of this CD.  There are lots of interesting comments on LONESOME JUBILEE you won't see here, in the reviews of the remaster. <br /> <br />Why do people compare John Cougar Mellencamp to Bruce Springsteen?  Mellencamp's sound, evident on LONESOME JUBILEE and many other albums, resembles that of the Rolling Stones, not Springsteen.
B00006F7S4|5.0|We know the Beck of of Mellow Gold, Odelay and Midnite vultures. We know the weird beats and samples. Fun tunes like Loser, Devil's haircut, where it's at. There's also a more personal Beck <br /> <br />In 2002, Beck wasn't feeling happy. <br />He took the formula of Mutations, no beats, just instruments. This time around a much darker album, putting his feelings into the music. And it works, my god it works. <br />This becomes quite obvious when the first song \\"The golden age\\" starts. \\"guess Im doing fine\\", \\"Lonesome Tears\\", \\"Around the bend\\" all express Beck's feelings about losing the love of his life. The emotion is so real. The production is great, listen to it on your headphones and get sucked into it. <br />Just like \\"The Golden Age\\" says, if you need to think about life, get in your car at midnight, and play this album.
B000002GQG|5.0|I don't know much about the whole psychedelia concept-album schtick that the Moodies were channeling when they laid down this great album - my folks were getting married at about this time. So it doesn't evoke halcyon days for me - I'd like to think I can just listen to it as a pure musical event, and as such although I don't rate it as their best album, I can wholeheartedly recommend it as an ensemble of gorgeous tunes, surpassing musicianship and some searingly perfect singing (check out the 2nd verse and chorus of \\"The Actor\\", the peak of the set, IMHO). <br />The album opens with \\"Departure\\" - which is edgy and manic, someone losing their mind in 52 easy seconds, before segueing into \\"Ride my See-Saw\\", a rocky little number with rat-race lyrics and a sweet guitar solo from Hayward. Some folks denigrate \\"Dr. Livingstone I Presume\\" but I cannot agree. Sure it's a little dopey (polar bears in the Antarctic?) but the chorus is catchy. <br />I never really liked \\"House of Foor Doors\\" - or at least the \\"song\\"-parts. The instrumental breaks are superb - one always remembers that the Moodies played all this THEMSELVES and is suitably awestruck. <br />\\"Legend of a Mind\\" is an acknowledged classic that has its detractors. I don't believe it to be a pro-LSD song, or at least it is too ambiguous to support that conclusion without qualification. The musicianship is superb - Ray Thomas' flute playing is masterly, and the ending is hard-driving sonic bliss. However, I rate \\"Our Guessing Game\\" (from EGBDF) and \\"Eternity Road\\" (TOCCC) as better examples of Ray's skill as a songwriter. <br />\\"Voices in the Sky\\" is a little slight. Nice, but slight. \\"The Best Way To Travel\\" is interesting but again a little lightweight. Momentum returns with \\"Visions of Paradise\\" and \\"The Actor\\" - gorgeous flute, vocals, guitar work. \\"The Actor\\" is a pearl of rare perfection, even for the Moodies in this era. <br />The set concludes with \\"The Word\\" - a Graeme Edge poem and \\"Om\\" - a near-parody ofEastern thought and sound that is saved by the superb massed harmonies that the Moodies did so well at their peak. <br />I must enjoy this album - the title is my Amazon byline - and I believe anyone who enjoys musicianship and the craft of songwriting will hear this without regret.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I knew this album would be good. 22 tracks, and well, its just Sufjan. But nothing could have prepared me for the grandeur of this record.       While being simply amazing, the album was written in a very peculiar way. For those of you who don't know this, Sufjan just travelled around the beautiful state of Illinois and wrote songs about whatever inspired him. He has done the same previously with Michigan (his home state), and plans on eventually doing so with all 50 states!     Just to give you an insight to his greatness, I bought the CD the first day it came out and listened to the very first track without looking at the title first. It is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard- the piano part is gorgeous. But then I looked at the title and was surprised to find: \\"Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois.\\" I listened to it again, and there it was! How he can make a song about a UFO sighting so dazzling is beyond me.           Like I said, the album comes equipped with 22 tracks, and the total time of the CD is about 75 minutes.  All the songs are good, but a few of the best are: #1 (the UFO song I mentioned earlier) #4 JOHN WAYNE GACY, JR. #10 Casimir Pulaski Day. #12 The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts. #15 The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades is Out to Get Us! #20 THE TALLEST MAN WITH THE BROADEST SHOULDERS Part I/ Part II etc.        This album is truly perfect. It is so personal and heartfelt, yet anyone can relate to his brilliant poetry. It takes you through a range of emotions, from sorrow and melancholy to peace and rapture. Sufjan is an amazing song-wirter, and anyone on the face of this spacious earth will enjoy the beautiful music he writes.    5 stars. I wish I could give it more.
B00005JNNZ|2.0|Watching Samuel L. Jackson play man-as-melba-toast in \\"Coach Carter,\\" I got to thinking about his showy, hilarious, vicious performance in \\"Jackie Brown,\\" where, as Ordell, he has a moment where he thinks hard, as hard as a man can think, and arrives at the woman who's betrayed him.  <br /> <br />It could be the best scene in Jackson's career, for it is a quiet, divine moment of silence, of a man and his mind. Cruel as man may be, we were born to think, and think hard, and there are in fact answers at the end of that moment. Not of all of them, but a few, and they're occasionally important. <br />  <br />If you were to think that hard about the ideas being thrown around \\"Coach Carter,\\" really think about them, well, they become less universal truths and more some of those cynical, capitalist fantasies we like to tell young people. The movie is more than two hours long and it's really peddling one lesson: Get to college. Not go. Get.   <br />  <br />It surrounds that lesson with a lot of different values like persistence and discipline, toughness and respect, and we could focus on those values if the centerpiece of the film wasn't a moment where Ken Carter (Jackson), basketball coach of Richmond High School in Southern California, cancels his team's basketball games because they're failing to maintain a 2.3 grade point average. Why isn't a 2.0, the district standard, good enough? As Carter calmly explains, well, you'd have score higher on the SATs to get a basketball scholarship with just a 2.0. With a 2.3, which is just a C-plus, well, it's easier.  <br />  <br />And that's the thinking of the movie directed by Thomas Carter, no relation to real-life Ken Carter, who really did lock his undefeated team out of practices and games in 1999. The school board voted to end the lockout, as it should, because Carter's \\"contracts\\" were arbitrary and not even necessarily focused on learning. Just getting a score. If you really want to know why we're behind other industrializednations in every school subject - I'd include English -  \\"Coach Carter\\" brilliantly shows the way: Americans are fixated on tallying success on the chalkboard whether it means achievement or not.  <br />  <br />It's about \\"goals,\\" not betterment. Carter was a military and business man before he is hired as Richmond coach, and in those worlds, goals - sales goals, mission goals -  are neat and important. We've achieved lots of goals and \\"success\\" in Iraq. We blitzed to Baghdad in three weeks! Eighteen months later, there's electricity four hours out of the day and the sewers are above ground.  <br />  <br />So you get to college. You have to go, too. <br />  <br />I considered these things because, on a filmmaking level, \\"Coach Carter\\" is better suited for those CBS Hallmark specials. Thomas Carter and his team make a safe, clean, well-lit film with Jackson's stiff, starched shirt braying at his troops, who throw a little attitude but generally want a father figure to hug. The team is made of the same old parts: The Angry, Troubled One; The Funny One; The One With A Pregnant Girlfriend; The Dumb One; The Good One, which in this case is Carter's son; The Different One, which here is just a white guy.  Showdowns, throwdowns, staredowns, put-downs - Carter employs at least one of each.  <br />  <br />It's boilerplate, and there is no \\"Coach Carter\\" without the lockout material and grandstanding for education. Consider that there is an player who can barely read during the movie; we learn later he attended college. Does that say more or less for our education system? College basketball graduation rates are miserable precisely because many athletes don't belong there, and we've got enough examples of athletes landing in college without a junior high education.  <br />  <br />The basketball scenes provide another view of the movie's problem: They involve an element of strategy and employ various cameras, but we're never allowed a moment to forget the glut of alternating dunks and three-pointers That's what passes for success in American basketball.  <br />  <br />In the Olympics, the rest of the world disagreed.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is by far the greatest album I have ever owned. This is the album that defined high school for me. The sund is still fresh and really never has been topped by Weezer. The two greatest tracks on the CD were Only in Dreams and Surf Wax America. Only in Dreams is a tour de force with the greatest climax and ending of any song I have ever heard. Surf Wax America is just awesome. Everything else is awesome too.

From the uplifting Judas is Rising to the ultimate head banging feast of Deal with the Devil the Priest is back in tact and ready to slay your desire for a metal frenzy. Lochness is the only weak track and Rob should be punished for including it but you will not remember it in the midst of this onslaught.
B0002OERI0|5.0|At the same time, Green Day's seventh studio album is very different from, and the same as, all of their previous efforts. And I say this in the most positive way. American Idiot is easily their greatest album to date. Where their previous album, 2000's Warning, was a semi-acoustic, Who-esque album, American Idiot shows the band returning to their cranked-up, Dookie roots. <br /> <br />This is one of the band's only albums in which the singles aren't the record's best material (which is good, because you'd have to live under a rock to not know the first verse of \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\"). My personal favorite is \\"Whatsername,\\" the PERFECT track to close a CD with. Not a fast song, but not a slow, sappy, acoustic song either. Like any Green Day CD, American Idiot is very upbeat, it puts you in a good mood, and it's the perfect CD to listen to on a breezy spring afternoon. <br /> <br />It's amazing how a band can keep the same sound and music style year after year, and still create an album that makes you want to listen over and over. Hate the hype if you want, but it's hard to hate the album once you've listened to it all the way through. When I put this CD on, it takes me away to another world, and I can count on one hand the number of CD's I own that are like that. Thanks, Green Day, for a wonderful CD.
0880389052|4.0|I've steered clear of Salvatore for years, because the guy is just everywhere...same with Drow, everywhere you look its drow this and drow that...but I picked up a copy of this book for a quarter at a library book sale, and was pleasantly surprised. It's not ground-breaking, but it's damned compulsive reading...so now I have to embark on catching up with the rest of the story...one down, only about six hundred to go.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I was in the flight from Hongkong to Los Angeles the first time I listened all songs in this album. You know twelve hours flight is not just boring but also exhausting. From many albums offered in \\"audio presentation\\" of my flight, I discovered this album is magnificent. I like almost all songs. I didn't know Shania Twain much before, `cause I knew only her masterpieces: From This Moment and You're Still The One. But this album show me all her remaining songs are as the best as her masterpieces. <br /> <br />The first five times I listened to this album, I prefer the first four songs and her masterpieces I mentioned above. But, when I got home and bought this album, I realized that all songs are as good as the first four. Suddenly I want to see her live performing in a city nearby.
0783232039|5.0|For the first time since its' conception, Chucky takes center stage in this movie but not without a lil' help. The story itself goes something like this...Brought back to life by his former girlfriend Tiffany(Jennifer Tilly), Chucky(Brad Dourif) proceeds to turn his human sweetie into a pint-sized talking doll with attitude just like himself, and together they hit the road looking for a magic amulet and young new bodies to inhabit. That's where the fun begins. They hitch a ride with runaways Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile and leave a trail of corpses behind. John Ritter and Alexis Arquette also star in the movie. The conclusion, however, leaves things open for the sequel \\"Seed of Chucky\\". But, it's still a fun ride, nonetheless. In my opinion, Bride of Chucky is just the shot in the arm needed to revive the ten-year old series. I've loved the series since it first came out and, even though I love Freddy-Jason-Michael Myers and Pinhead too(they all kick some serious behind themselves), they've got nothing on ol' Chucky. He's a pint-sized terror that gives you plenty of laughs with all the gore. Ronny Yu(of Freddy Vs Jason) directs the movie and does an outstanding job at breathing new life into the Chucky saga.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Gosh, you don't need to keep bringing it up, folks: Britney ain't got the best chops in the business but she CAN or COULD sing...once. Sure, she's no Christina but Xtina's no Britney. Listen to Spears' first album and you wouldn't know it's the same person. Rappers sit on the crappers and don't even sing...and yet, for some reason, they're considered musicians. Hard rock singers don't really sing, they scream. So get it right if you're going to diss Brit: rap is talking in rhythm and hard rock is screaming to beats. That said, this album -like Britney or not personally (this isn't a place to diss the girl, it's to review music)- is superb, containing almost all of the teen queen's hits. Nearly every song is recognizable which is quite impressive. So get over it, folks. Eminem (you talk, not sing and you sound whiny and constipated) and all you hard rock fans stop dissing the queen of top 40 pop...if you don't like the music, don't listen. It's that simple, durr. Like her or not, Britney Spears is \\"Toxic,\\" through and through.
B00003CXQX|4.0|I ordered this movie for my daughter as we kept seeing previews for it on another video.  She loves it. She's 3 and walks around repeating some of the funny lines said by the characters.  She calls it the \\"Silly Donkey\\" movie. <br /> <br />
0385512104|5.0|This novel is one I consistently recommend to friends looking for something to read.  Christopher, the main character, is a fifteen year old autistic boy who embarks on a quest to find out who murdered his neighbor's dog.  The book is written as if Christopher is writing it himself, providing insight into the mind of an autistic teen.  The result is a truly unique book that's a big quirky, a bit heartwarming, and totally hilarious. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
B000062Y98|5.0|This is the first thing I've ever heard by these guys. Wait For An Answer was the first song I ever heard and blew me away completely. Every song on this album is amazing. This is one album that will go down in history. In my mind it's a lot better than their Nightfall In Middle Earth album. The choruses sound so celestial. It seems like every Blind Guardian albumbuilds up their talent and this is the result of all those years of hard work. It's not one of those albums you put on for background music. Upon hearing it for the first few times, I'd suggest you really sit down and pay attention to all of the songs.  <br /> <br />The vocals are incredibly clean, the guitars are so melodic and compliment everything else instead of trying to rise above it. The drums on this album are out of this world. Check out the double bass on Jeruselem, Battlefield and Punishment Divine. I can't say enough about these guys.  <br /> <br />Oh and to MunkMunk, A Night At The Opera (along with a day at the races - 2 albums done by Queen) are actually the names of two movies done by the Marx Brothers, long before Queen was ever heard of. So who's really ripping of who?? Anyways, A night at the opera and a day at the races werer terms used by people back in the early 1900's. Just like some people go \\"clubbing\\". If you don't like this album or Blind Guardian in general, thats your thing. But don't go accusing them of stealing queen albums or anything else. Especially when you don't have all your facts straight.
B00092QUQC|5.0|Being an american living in Austria, I have grown to love this band! Not only do they rock but they stay true to their roots! I happen to have liked all of their albums but tend to like the harder sound like on Dial Hard and G.This album goes back to the beginning. There really isn't one bad song on the album. It opens with '' All We Are'' ( a great opener) number 3 ''Lift You Up'' ( a great crowd anthem) 4. ''Everything I Want''( a perfect ballad but not less than I expected as Gotthard write the perfect ballads!) and 7. ''I'm Alive'' ( my personal favorite....it rocks!) This is definately an album that I can fully stand behind and recommend! You won't regret it! ANd if you ever get the chance to see them on tour......don't miss it....a show you'll never forget!
B00000K0DV|3.0|\\"The New York Ripper\\" seems to be just about the most reviled giallo/slasher out there.  Sure, mainstream reviewers haven't heard of it, but I've read quite a bit of stuff on the horror genre and slasher movies, and this movie always gets singled out as being evil and destructive, even amongst critics who are relatively lenient when it comes to this sorta thing.  Why this is I can't really imagine. (Though you kinda get the impression that professional horror writer's are often vaguely embarassed of the genre, so they gotta show that they have there limits, and thus be deeply offended by something)  It's pretty gruesome, as far a this sorta thing goes, but other films do come plenty close to it.  And yeah, the killer singles out women, but that's not exactly rare. (Though, those claiming that women are killed far more often than men in slasher movies are full of crap.  Sometimes they are, sometimes not, and overall the difference isn't that big.  In fact, I remember reading a study, comparing the top 10 slasher films from '81, '85, '89, respectively, and it came to the conclusion that more men died, overall.  However, I seem to recall that a number of the films on there aren't what I'd call slasher films, so I don't know how accurate that really is. Anyway...)  I find it particularly funny that Fulci has been labeled a misogynist due to this film.  Sure, all those other movies where he horribly mangled both sexes extensively were meaningless, but this one, where he solely focuses on women, ohh, this means a whole lot.  (And, of course, this was actually done for thematic/plot/dramatic purposes.  If you can believe such things, this film actually has a moral, of a sort)  Anyway, long story short, if you find this film offensive, you're a douche or a sissy.  Maybe both. (Or I should say, if you find it morally repugnant.  If you just think it's distasteful you may be alright)  Still, this movie isn't really very good.  It's alright, worth a look, but I'd definitely say you oughta just rent it, even if you really like some of Fulci's other stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, I could try and talk about character and plot and whatnot, but ehh.  It's a kinda garden-variety Giallo, meaning that the killer's motive is silly, and that you couldn't possibly guess who he is other than through sheer blind luck.  But, who watches this sorta film for the plot?  Stylistically, I was shocked by just how Fulci-esque this film is.  Since it approaches horror in a very different way, eschewing the zombies and other supernatural stuff of his last few films I assumed this would kinda feel different.  Nope, all of Fulci's trademarks are still here, with the extreme close-ups and bizarre fetishism, and slow, drawn out gore.  And what can I say, I enjoy Fulci's extremely distinctive style.  It is a bit different in that it's got a lot of gratuitous sex and nudity, which gives it all an extra-smutty feel.  Also, the soundtrack isn't up to par, as he uses a weird electronic-disco-jazz kinda thing.  It's sorta fun, but the Frizzi stuff from `They Beyond' and `City of the Living Dead' is way better.<br /><br />In the end, what makes this film passable instead of good is that the killing scenes and stalking scenes just aren't all that great.  The stalking scenes just lack any real suspense or any particularly interesting staging.  The one exception is the scene where a character has to slip out of bed, having just slept with someone who may be the killer.  Also, she's tied to the bed, which complicates things. Also,  some of the gore effects are kinda painful, but none of it is all that interesting.  For the most part, Fulci's interested in brutality rather than creativity, a method which doesn't really suit him.  His gore effects have never been very realistic, so he's gotta make em interesting, at least.  There are two scenes which are pretty extreme, the two scenes which doubtless earn this film it's reputation.  They're pretty nasty, all admit, but most the rest of the stuff doesn't do too much to me. (One involves slow mutilation with a razor, the other a broken bottle going somewhere it really shouldn't go.)  The intensity of the murder scenes is severely undercut but the killer's fondness of using a Donald Duck voice.  So, much of the time when the killer's doing someone in, he's quacking his head off.  Pretty funny.  Dunno why Fulci thought doing that would be a good idea, though I guess he didn't actually write the script.<br /><br />This isn't one of Fulci's more revered films, and it shouldn't be.  It kinda falls in a middle ground.  It's pretty gory, but the gore isn't very fun, as this film is pretty sleazy, and it doesn't have any fcool zombies.  So, it doesn't really work as a serious film, but it's too dirty to really be enjoyed as camp.  Still, I was sufficiently entertained.  Obviously, you'll wanna see some of Fulci's more famous stuff before even considering looking into this.<br /><br />Grade: C+oesn't do too much to me.

0739313126|5.0|I loved this audiobook and I would highly recommend that anyone thinking of reading the book listen to the audiobook instead.  Paul Michael is such a great narrator - he has this amazing ability to do all sorts of accents.  He definitely brings the listener into the story in a way that reading it yourself couldn't do.<br /><br />The story itself is also excellent.  I'm not generally a mystery/suspense fan but with all the buzz about this book I had to find out for myself and I was hooked from the beginning.  It's a bit long for an audiobook but it's worth it.  Just make sure you get the unabridged version so you don't miss out on anything!  However, take note that once you start listening you won't be able to stop!
0679720200|5.0|This is perhaps the most disturbing book I have read in the recent past. Camus gives a chilling story of a man with no morals. C.S. Lewis desribes a man like this in Mere Christianity as being like someone who is born color bind, except that instead of being blind to colors, he is blind to morals.  <br /> <br />Most of Camus books deal almost exclusively with existentialism, mostly with transcending Nihilism. However, in this book, Nihilism is never transcended. All is meaningless, even death.  <br /> <br />Albert Camus is a literary genius, but God have mercy on the soul of the man who believes anything like what the man in this book believes, for his life is truly meaningless in his eyes.
B0009IW98O|4.0|The Good<br /><br />Seger and company pump up \\"Bo Diddley\\" with funky guitar tones and licks, stirring tambourine, and pulsing Hammond organ tones. More funk-style guitar dominates \\"Love the One Your With\\". This is one of the most soulful and emotionally charged versions I've heard of this song. The tuneful female vocals blend well with Seger's deep, throaty delivery. The bluesy solo work is simply stunning.<br /><br />\\"Humming Bird\\" is all about the vocals during the first few moment of the song. The emotion builds with the addition of faint guitar and piano. The track takes a spiritual turn when the choir kicks in. \\"Let It Rock\\" is all about blues-rock with its blues chord progression and 50's style licks. They forgo the standard guitar solo for an impressive organ solo. Bob's touching and earnest vocals compliment the harmonica, strings, and piano on \\"Someday\\".<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />Nothing notable<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />Light one up, sit back, and enjoy. Smokin' O.P.'s is a lost classic.
0723284075|5.0|The books were a perfect gift, the reciepent was just as thrilled as I was. The kids loved them and always ask for them to be read at bedtime. Perfect. <br />
B0009HLDFU|2.0|If you're expecting songs like \\"All my Life\\" \\"Everlong\\" or \\"Times Like These\\", I would advise against this album.  Not because Dave doesn't sound amazing -- His voice is astounding, although he has a limited range.  The beats are pretty good as well.  But none of the songs are truly \\"catchy\\" or particularly melodic.  This is largely due to two things: 1. Unimpressive guitar riffs. 2. Terrible mixing and post-production.  The single, \\"Best of You\\", probably comes the closest to a catchy and refined song, but it too suffers from repetitive lyrics and overused riffs.  Whoever mixed this album was either 1. very poor or 2. very rushed.  Sometimes when labels rush a record's release, it suffers in the mixdown department, giving it a muddy sound where none of the band members have their \\"own space\\" in the sonic field. <br /> <br />If you're a Foo fan, you'll probably love it.  Hopefully though, it isn't because you feel obligated to.  If you're a passive fan like myself and are looking for something melodic and catchy, give the track \\"On the Mend\\" a listen, but don't buy this CD - especially if you're computer-illiterate and don't want to take the cumbersome steps to circumvent copyright protection in order to simply tranfer this onto an MP3 player.
B0000524E5|2.0|Dude this movie was HILARIOUS!!! its about this dude, and he couldn't find his car.    But seriously, imagine that a very rich father is almost nagged to death by his spoiled daughter, who wants to see her marginal screenplay about her adventures in the NY club scene made into a movie. He finally agrees to bankroll the project on the condition that she turns over all actual production decisions to a competent production company. The production group casts a pair of likable actors and get John Goodman to play a supporting role. They target the Britney segment of the Lifetime movie audience with a teen angst/struggling artist story-line. They also go after a large secondary audience-those (of both sexes) who like to watch hot women in tight pants. They have a large enough budget to staff the project with an excellent crew although they skimp on production design, supporting cast talent, and editing. They make a movie called Coyote Ugly and successfully market it to their target audiences. If you are part of their secondary target audience it is best to watch it on DVD so you can avoid any scenes devoid of tight pants.    Problem--Nothing happens. This story is so tired only the worn down father of the screenwriter would dream of making it into a movie, and just on the long shot that his daughter would move out of the house and get a real job once she had a writing credit on her resume. The Olsen twins, credited as someone named Piper Perabo; play Violet, a young songwriter who makes the BIG journey all the way from New Jersey to New York City to realize her dream. Olsen Twin Violet has stage fright but immediately meets the nicest boy in NYC - an Australian (played by Adam Garcia) who collects comic books, thinks he saw her in a television show with Lori Loughlin, works an assortment of entry-level jobs, and still has time to truly care about her. Supermodel Tyra Banks appears on the screen a few times but does not have to act or to play an actual \\"character\\".     Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
0689859368|4.0|I was stumped.  When a young mother came up to my library desk the other day and asked me whether or not \\"The Field Guide\\", first volume in \\"The Spiderwick Chronicles\\" would be considered too scary for her little one, I found I couldn't answer.  I couldn't answer because (shame shame) I hadn't read the book.  It's not a long book.  It's not a difficult book.  It's not even a boring book.  Somehow, however, I'd always managed to miss it.  Now my back was to the wall and it was time to read that puppy ASAP.  A cursory glance showed me that the author, Holly Black, wrote one of my favorite teen fairy stories \\"Tithe\\".  The illustrator, Tony DiTerlizzi, was partly responsible for that breathtaking \\"The Spider and the Fly\\" that came out a few years ago.  A little happier with the prospect of spending time with two such enticing names in the child-lit world, I dove into their first book... and was delighted.  I've been railing against early chapter books like \\"The Secrets of Droon\\" and \\"The Magic Tree House\\" series.  These are books that are written for young kids and that are adored widely.  How much more difficult would it be, then, to write similar books but with GOOD writing?  With \\"Spiderwick\\" we have our answer.  It's hard, but not impossible.<br /><br />Three siblings arrive at their new home with a whole lot of baggage (physical and otherwise).  Their mother has divorced relatively recently, and each kid has had to deal with the change in a different way.  Mallory, the eldest at thirteen, has thrown herself body and soul into her fencing.  Simon concentrates more fully on his pet animals and his twin brother Jared... well Jared tends to get into fights at school.  He hasn't found anything to fill the lonely and angry hours spent missing his father.  Almost suspended from his last school, Jared hopes to get a clean start in the family's new home.  It's a huge mansion, falling apart at the seams, that currently belongs to their great-aunt Lucinda.  Once inside, the kids start hearing noises in the walls and finding mysterious rooms without any doors.  Jared alone follows these discoveries to their natural conclusions when he realizes that they aren't the only ones living on the Spiderwick Estate.  Something else is too.  And it's mad.<br /><br />At first glance this title looks like nothing so much as a rip-off of the highly successful (and admittedly better written) \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\".  It's a foot tall hardback copy done in a classic font with intricate pen-and-ink illustrations.  It even has a note on the back cover reading, \\"Go away / close the book / put it down / do not look\\".  Very Lemony Snicket.  The book is also about three siblings that must deal with a separation within their family, but here the similarities stop.  Obviously the publishers thought it would be a good idea to package \\"Spiderwick\\" books like Snicket's for marketing purposes.  Beyond the obvious outer similarities, however, this book is wildly different.  Written for a younger audience, \\"The Field Guide\\" is far more concerned with faeries and spirits than with the machinations of an evil Count.  There are little clues for kids to solve and a mystery to conquer.  Best of all, however, is the writing itself.<br /><br />You know you're in good hands when the twin brothers featured in your children's series don't always get along and CERTAINLY don't think alike.  Jared and Simon obviously care for one another, but they have spats and fights like any sibling duo.  Their older sister, Mallory, finds herself on the receiving end of a particularly nasty boggart in a scene that many a little sibling will probably be taking notes from.  In the end, however, it's the three of them against the wide fey world.  If you find yourself rooting for them, don't be surprised.<br /><br />Tony DiTerlizzi, as I mentioned before, is responsible for the illustrations here and he owes a great deal to the man credited in his dedication.  Says DiTerlizzi, \\"For ArthurRackham, may you continue to inspire others as you have me\\".  Inspire's one word for it.  DiTerlizzi obviously spent a lot of time poring over Rackham's intricate mysterious (and downright ghoulish at times) paintings in children's books long past.  Here, you have a slightly cleaner version of the old master's critters, but they still convey the right amount of menace when they need to.<br /><br />Kids reading this book may initially be disappointed that there's only a single magical critter to be found within its pages.  Fortunately, the book will certainly whet the whistles of many a fantasy-craving youngster.  If you're going to find your children a young reader series for their perusal, you could do far far worse than this entertaining first book in a five book series.\\"For Arthur Rackham, may you continue to inspire others as you have me\\".

B00004STPT|5.0|After listening to the Gladiator soundtrack I feel refreshed.    The music is so fresh and new to a world where composing new music is somewhat hard.  Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard should be congratulated for this wonderful soundtrack. <br /> <br />   All the tracks have a 'Roman' feel to it that makes it very unique.  There are great action tracks (most notably, Battle) and some very sad tracks.  Vocals blend into some of the tracks making it sound like no other soundtrack.  A very nice thing is that there  is no break between tracks; they all play into each other.  You may think that the music would be chopped up if you skipped to a middle track, but it's not.  Everything can stand alone by itself.   <br />   One other thing I noticed is the main theme of Pirates of the Carribean is in track three.  Klaut Bedelt did do some composing in this soundtrack and composed the Pirates soundtrack. <br /> <br />   Gladiator is definately deserving of your time and money.
B0009MDPYM|2.0|Constantine is an adaptation of the classic DC Comic book called Hellblazer and a half hearted one at that because only names of the characters are the same, not the story or the origin of what the book was really about. Keanu Reeves literally gives his middle finger to the fans of the comic with a bad performance that lacks the charm and the smarts of his comic counterpart. He's so bad in the role that he makes the movie into a complete joke. The special effects are not very good and most of the other performances by the actors runs the gamut from being decent to flat out horrible. The only actor who comes away with a great and powerful performance is Rachel Weisz, who not only gives this movie an unnecessary amount of class and respect but also gives it the only real and human performance in the entire film. She's so good in this movie that if you had a real director and some real scriptwriters, She could have made a better lead character in a much better and serious film than this.     My two stars go to Rachel Weisz's performance alone. The rest of the film does not warrant even one

B000004286|5.0|I have never heard a soundtrack by James Horner, until I purchased Braveheart.  This is a fantastic soundtrack, the saddest and most peaceful I have ever heard. It's quite long, (77 minutes) but you certaintly get your money back many times over. <br /> <br />   The main title sets up the soundtrack perfectly with some great bagpipe music.  Track two is where the most common theme is first found; and it is played in many of the other tracks.  There are many tracks with wonderful bagpipes played expertly.  All of the score is quiet and sad (not much in the way of action tracks) but are certaintly worth your while. <br /> <br />   James Horner, in my opinion, (and your's too after listening to this soundtrack) should have one an Oscar for this masterpiece of composing.  If you want a very sad and beautiful soundtrack, then go and pick up Braveheart today.
0385513755|5.0|Dan Brown has brought the ages-old mystery of Leonardo Da Vinci, The Holy Grail, and even Jesus Christ Himself into the mainstream with this awesome book.  While this book is in fact an awesome novel, but is full of astonishing facts about the life of Jesus Christ, his alleged marriage to Mary Magdalene, their allaged child Sarah, The Knights Templar and their connection to modern-day Masons, and the clues left by Leonardo Da Vinci leading researchers to believe that much has been covered up by the Catholic Church and Opus Dei. The author has really done his homework on this one, and combined with his unique storytelling talent, has created a book that no one will be able to put down!
B000002U82|3.0|Some songs are brilliant, some are quite boring. It's good, but it's also overrated. Far from the \\"greatest album of all time\\" as many claim. <br /> <br />I'm guessing that it's much easier to enjoy when you're high. Very, very high.
0142000655|5.0|When I first started reading EAST OF EDEN I was surprised by the fact that it did not rush into the saga of Caleb and aron Trask. I was also somewhat shocked by the vulgarity. But as I read on i saw that John Steinbeck wasn't being vulgar, he was giving a provocative look at what human nature really is, down to the ugly roots of imperfection.  <br />      This book starts out with the story of good-hearted Adam and his wild brotehr Charles. Their father is harsh and they both come off with emotional issues. When Cathy Ames shows up at their house, beaten and in need of care, Adam rushes to her rescue. She is sweet and angelic and he falls in love, and they are married. Little does he know evil lies beneath her pretty face. She has a past of murder and is completely heartless. She is unfaithful to him on the very night of their wedding, and in just gets worse from there. After the birth of their twins she shoots Adam, leaving him desolate and in a state of shock. Eventually he  comes out of it with the aid of his wise freinds Lee and Samuel. Adam recovers somehwat from his shock and starts raising his boys.  <br />     This is where Aron and Caleb come in. Aron is beautiful and loved by all. Caleb is covered in a cloud of darkness and he is loved by very few. All he wants is acceptance from his father, and all Adam wants is him to be like his brother.  <br />     With a splendid cast of unique characters, this book is amazing. It goes very deep and while it does ramble at times, the story is one of both good and evil, loved and unloved, love and hate.   <br />
B000002N2P|4.0|To the \\"Green Day poser\\" below: Dookie wasn't their debut. Their first full-length LP was Kerplunk, and they had three EPs before that. These are all on Lookout! Records. <br /> <br />And what's wrong with liking Dookie the best anyway? It's my favourite, and I'm a lot more familiar with their discography. I can actually keep my facts straight too. Poseur. <br /> <br />Bottom line: People can like whatever they want. Ditch the I'm-punker-than-thou front, ESPECIALLY when you don't know what the fu*ck you're talkng about.
1400043662|4.0|I have to agree with the other reviewers.  This is not the best Murakami to start with if you are unfamiliar with his work.  Try The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles instead if you are a Murakami newbie.   <br /> <br />That said, this novel is still absorbing and amazingly written.  Who, but the great Haruki Murakami, could make a pimp named Colonel Sanders, fish falling from the sky, a woman who is a ghost of herself, all work as plot elements?   <br /> <br />My biggest problem with this novel was the ending.  It was ultimately unsatisfying.  There were too many loose ends.  Without spoiling the ending, the story of the killing wasn't really resolved and I still wasn't clear on exactly what happened. <br /> <br />This is a good choice for Murakami fans, but again, try The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles if you are still among the SADLY uninitated!
B000002U9Y|4.0|With Syd Barrett basically out of the picture (it is questionable that in the first track, \\"Let There Be More Light\\", Syd sings one or more of the sections of the song), Pink Floyd wanted to head to a new direction. Making their way into the seventies, people saw a decline in psychedelic rock's popularity. Pink Floyd did a unique with Saucerful of Secrets: They combined psychedelia and dark rock. <br /> <br />A Saucerful of Secrets starts out with a very unique bass line. \\"Let There Be More Light\\" is a spacey, cosmic adventure with very moving vocals and a great sound the whole way through. \\"Remember A Day\\" is a bit more slow and a little repetative, but very ambitious. The masterpiece of the album, however, in my opinion, is \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\", which is a song Roger Waters partially stole from a poetry book from the Mao dynasty. 'Over the mountain, watching the watcher' it goes, 'waking the darkness, breaking the grapevine - moment of birth is born into shadow... love is the darkness that ripens the wine'. It is some of Roger Waters' most brilliant, most poetic song writing of his entire career. \\"Corporal Clegg\\" is a clever and intelligent charade of war (most likely Vietnam) which features a wonderful solo of kazoos. Turn this one up loud, and scare the neighbors! <br /> <br />On side 2, we have the title track, \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\", which is a twelve-minute instrumental of frantic banging and clashing of china and cymbals, with insane keyboard and piano action, and a very strange slide guitar technique - all with Nick Mason's fabulous drumming in the background continuously increasing in intensity and tempo. Roger Waters was once quoted saying that it was supposed to demonstrate the before, during, and aftereffects of a battle. The prayer, the fighting, the celebration of victory. The song ends with a beautiful choir leading toward the closure, and let me tell you this too is a masterpiece of rock instrumentals. <br /> <br />The fun stops here, however. The next two songs, \\"See-Saw\\" and \\"Jugband Blues\\" are essentially fillers. Roger Waters himself thought that \\"See-Saw\\" was one of the biggest dissapointments of his career. It has something to do with his sister, and their relationship. Otherwise, however, the premise of this song is unknown to me. Maybe other reviews here can shed some light on that. <br /> <br />Essentially, this record is a very good production. I cannot award it five stars for the appearance of these two last tracks. They should have stuck some of the lost Barrett tracks on this album, such as \\"Vegetable Man\\" (which has a great vocal line from Nick Mason, who also does a section in \\"Corporal Clegg\\"). Instead, however, I believe that the band wanted to take a different direction, and I can respect that. <br /> <br />The album has a dark feel - much unlike the 'fairy tale and hoola-hoops' attitude of \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\". While not exactly deep or depressing, the poetry in some of the songs, and the creativity in others, warrants the purchase of this record. The album may want to be bought after the listener has experienced other Floyd records, like the more popular titles, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, and Animals.  <br /> <br />However, if you want to see the first full perfomance that the present-day Pink Floyd (with the inclusion of Roger Waters, of course) put on, this album is a must have. It's clever, it's unique, and it's a change. Some songs are dissapointing, but the majority are a good listen and they are especially fun to listen to at night, right before you go to sleep. Your dreams will be full of out-of-this-world images, and emotion that really could only come from the genius of Roger Waters' writing skills and the instrumental virtuosity of Pink Floyd.
0812550706|5.0|In the introduction, Orson Scott Card mentions that different people will come away with totally different ideas about this book. After reading other reviews, I can see that he hit it right on the nose. I am so caught up in this book at the present that I have to stop and think about what I just read. His insight into the human psyche is so amazing. I am not really a science fiction fan, but I have been an Orson Scott Card fan ever since I, without much thought, picked up a copy of \\"The Worthing Chronicles\\" in a used bookstore.  <br /> <br />The characters are very real and rather convincing. It is incredible to simply examine them because you can get into their heads and see their motives and how they think. Mr. Card, I believe, delves into human behavior with true expertise. When the characters manipulate adults or each other, I feel a kind of wonder when I read their thoughts and feel positive that this is how a child genius might think (under the circumstances).   <br /> <br />Some may find it boring, difficult to understand, simplistic or too unbelievable, but that may be due to the reader, not the writer. Children do have very complex emotions and thought processes, they usually just cannot express them in a sophisticated manner. I have worked with children (I am a female teacher, residential treatment center), both gifted and slow, and I have seen some of the same un-childlike characteristics due to their extreme circumstances. If you have ever read \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" then it is hard to pooh-pooh the idea of insightful and complex thoughts coming from a child.  <br /> <br />I adore this book and so do many others. I do not see this as a book about Science Fiction, I see it as a book about human relationships, complex social issues, the consequences of the manuipulation of others and an excellent look on how a sociopath might operate (Peter). Someone else might see it as a boring, unrealistic,formulaic, book only a teen-aged boy would like. But that same person might also see \\"Lord of the Flies\\" as a stupid book about a bunch of little boys who run around playing games while they wait to be rescued. It is all depends on the mind of the reader.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|BEWARE: CONTAINS SPOILERS THROUGHOUT <br /> <br />Three Acts: The Inn, The Castle, The Dance  <br /> <br />Dance Of The Vampires is filmed in soft, bewitchingly pure-white snow. Amidst the magical snow filled landscapes of the Dolomite mountains, the fairytale begins. A shrilly chorus starts chanting an ostinato baroque melody, quivering comedically as the notes rise and fall in short, repeated patterns. Bright red cartoonish blood drops dip down the nocturnal blue background, bouncing of the credits. One drop hits a letter and explodes into a little bright read cartoonish bat, then flies away. The nocturnal blue sky casts an eerie azure glow over the snow, as a sleigh enters the screen, jingling along the lovely snow ridden paths. Wispy winds are heard in the distance, alongside fragmented howls.  <br /> <br />Professor Ambrosius (Jack McGowran), called \\"The Nut\\" by his colleagues, looks frozen. His helper, Alfred (director Roman Polanski), looks scared. A pack of wild, black dogs threatens the sleigh; Alfred, reminiscent of the great Buster Keaton, attempts to threaten the savage dogs with an umbrella. As if an umbrella would scare away wild dogs! Thus, the adventure begins.  <br /> <br />Ambrosius literally falls into the hands of local townspeople, European-Slavic Jews, who are mysteriously living locked up in an inn. Garlic decorates the rustic-red interior of the confining inn. The Inn-Keeper Shagal (Alfie Bass) and his townspeople deny that vampires exist, and quickly dismiss any talk of castles. They seem ashamed that such monsters even exist, even as they protect themselves from being victims of the vampires. They seem even more ashamed at their inability to fight off the monsters, much like the European and Slavic Jews who were unable to fight the Holocaust.  <br /> <br />Alfred ogles the full bosom of the vivacious, tempting, red-haired Sarah (Sharon Tate), Shagal's daughter, whose sexual energy ignites the introverted Alfred. Shagal (who's also sexuallyrepressed) attempts to repress her sexuality, which creates a link between the fear of monsters and the fear of sexuality. The link is left unexplored, because people know that there is really nothing to fear, there's no true danger, but they like being scared anyway. The vampires are in far-off castles, sex is not talked about, and Alfred slams the door shut as Sarah sensually bathes.  <br /> <br />Small, cramped spaces, repressed sexuality, and lack of cleanliness unsettles Sarah; soon, Count Von Krolock (Ferdy Mayne) bites Sarah as she's bathing, and takes her away from the Inn. As the Professor and Alfred stare at the blood on the bubbles and snow drifting downward onto the bath, Shagal immediately follows the Count, and is also bitten. After a chase, Ambrosius follows Shagal in pursuit of the vampires, and the fearful, childish Alfred follows in hot pursuit of Sarah.  <br /> <br />They find the picturesque, gothic castle, its feudal exterior slightly in ruin, snow enveloping the nooks, battlements, floor, steps, and crannies, creating an enchanting fairytale visage. Alfred and Ambrosius scale the roof, slide down, meet the hunchback, and leer at the hellish-red schemed interior of the castle, which slightly resembles the interior of a church, with high-vaulted arches. Soon they greet His Excellency. The Count (His Excellency) and the Professor discuss the philosophy of vampirism. The Count compliments the Professor's well-written vampire book, and asks the Professor to sign a copy for him. The Count's flamboyantly homosexual son likes Alfred.  <br /> <br />In the morning, they seek the crypt. Alfred to Ambrosius, whom he calls Master: maybe there is no crypt in the castle.  <br /> <br />Alfred, once again Keatonesque, pratfalls and stumbles as he refuses to slay the count, pleading for mercy as Ambrosius hangs halfway down from a window, stuck. Still morning, Alfred finds Sarah bathing (she's not fully transformed), and she refuses to leave the castle. Afterall, there's wide open spaces, open sexuality, and baths.  <br /> <br />A gorgeous Dance unfolds before them. Vampires celebrating fresh blood - first let's dance, then we'll feast! Classical baroque music floods the room as the ghastly vampires, adorned in vividly-coloured frocks, move in a classically choreographed fashion; the entire scene resembles Poe's Masque Of Red Death. Sarah, wearing a dazzlingly bright crimson red dress, is the Mask of Death, and she's the center of attention. She looks strikingly beautiful and purely innocent. Alfred and Ambrosius come to the rescue.  <br /> <br />They flee the Dance, jump into a sleigh, and take off into the snow, under a midnight-blue sky. Alfred ponders Sarah's delicate, tiny hand, and whimsically dreams about sleeping. Sarah's fangs plunge into his neck...  <br /> <br />
B000068OSK|4.0|Very nice debut album of detroit duo The White Stripes. Their music is based only on vocals, drums and of course a guitar. Yes, no bass!!! But in fact you don't miss it at all. Album is a nice mix of rock'n'roll, garage rock, folk and blues. Mostly original material with an exepction of three songs: Stop Breaking Down of a legendary blues performer Robert Johnson, One More Cup of Coffee of Bob Dylan and Joe Primrose's St. James Infirmary (previously recorded by such artists as Cab Calloway, Swing Cats, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Sidney Bechet, Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland,...). Johnny Walker of The Soledad Brothers is featured on two songs.<br />Hail, hail Rock 'n' Roll!
B000003TA4|5.0|It's very funny to read all these negative reviews from people who obviously are very frustrated by the fact that their little band doesn't get as much attention as Nirvana did. Those people are really really pathetic. I could name 1.000.000 bands I really hate, but I will NEVER spend one minute on reviewing those bands. I've better things to do. By writing all these negative reviews about Nirvana, you guys are basically saying that Nirvana is a relevant factor in your live. If you dont like Nirvana, just move on and do something usefull with your time, like listening to the bands you like and participating in discussion forums about those bands. Or just go hang out with some friends. Just get a life.
B00005KFUM|5.0|Just the best album ever. This band is from outer space. This is my idea of making music. All songs are strong. I must confess that I was so excited about this album. I bought two discs (two copies of ORIGIN OF....) and i wanted so much to share their music that i gave away this two cd's i had. Now i'm buying the third
B00005A0N5|4.0|This is the first Nightwish album I have bought.  I picked up the singles for \\"Wish I Had An Angel\\" and \\"Nemo\\" from iTunes, and was pretty well hooked.  I know this album will grow on me, but it doesn't grab me all that strongly, hence the 1 star penalty. <br /> <br />So why?  I can offer this anecdote by way of explanation.  When I saw Yes in concert last, they eschewed their popular, well-known numbers for a lot of back-catalog lengthy solo prog rock.  Personally, I couldn't care less for their \\"bluer\\" music; I like the songs I can sing along with.  I left that concert early.  (I also don't care for fully half of Led Zeppelin's music for the same reason, so you can see my sophistication here.)   <br />How does this relate?  Well, Tarja's voice is certainly an excellent addition to Metal, but it still seems like it's looking for a place.  She could always sing with a rock style, but that would destroy the originality. <br />In my opinion, Nightwish is better when they are able to more seamlessly meld opera and metal, as in \\"Wish I Had An Angel,\\" and contrasted to \\"Passion And The Opera\\" (what a bizarre mish-mash that last one is).  I think they best blend when Marco(?) sings duets with Tarja. <br /> <br />Maybe I just prefer their later stuff.  I certainly plan on picking up the latest disc for a second try. <br /> <br />Bottom line, if you like Trans-Siberian Orchestra, but wish they did something other than Christmas music (aside from Beethoven's), then Nightwish is the next best thing.
B00003CXA3|4.0|The French Connection is a great police thriller from 1971 with great performances from its cast and a realistic feel to the whole thing.  Connection follows New York narcotics officers Jimmy \\"Popeye\\" Doyle and Buddy \\"Cloudy\\" Russo as they try and track down several men involved with a drug deal that will bring in as much as $32 million dollars.  As sure as Popeye is that something is going to happen, his superiors don't believe him.  This is a gritty, no-nonsense cop thriller that has aged pretty well since 1971.  Always well known for the car/train chase with Hackman speeding along under the L train, Connection belongs up there with Bullitt and the Dirty Harry movies as one of the best cop movies ever.  Don't miss this classic or its sequel which is almost as good. <br /> <br />  In the performance that won him the Oscar, Gene Hackman plays Popeye Doyle, the obsessed narcotics officer who will stop at nothing to bring his man in.  Doyle is not a likable character, and this is part of what makes this movie more enjoyable because nothing is straightforward, everything is open for interpretation.  Fernando Rey is perfectly slimy as Alain Charnier, the organizer of the drug deal that will bring in $32 million.  Roy Scheider is excellent in a supporting role as Buddy Russo, Popeye's partner on the case.  The movie also stars Tony Lo Bianco and Marcel Bozzuffi, two men involved with Charnier.  The Five Star Collection DVD features a ton of worthwhile features.  Disc One features the movie in widescreen presentation, two commentary tracks, and a trailer.  Disc Two offers two making of documentaries, both very good, deleted scenes, director William Friedkin talks about those scenes, and a still gallery.  The DVD is a must have for fans of the movie.  For an exciting, tense and very realistic cop thriller, check out Gene Hackman in The French Connection!
B0006A9FKA|1.0|Terrible movie, looks like an amateur spoof of the classic horror movie Evil Dead. May be fun to watch for those who enjoy brains smashed with shovels and bloody guts all over the screen. For the rest 99% of you people, don't waste yout time and money.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I bought this cd just because I knew seven nation army and I thought to myself, hey, maybe one or two other ones will be good. I was mistaken. All of them except for one or two have become some of my favorite songs. This is music. They are one of the only bands still around that still know how to play riffs. I play bass, and I think that they should have had a bass player, but somegow Jack and Meg managed to pull it off. I highly recommend this CD to anyone.
0671027344|5.0|Occassionally you come across a novel so captavating that you are unable to put it down. Though this novel may appear to be one the those \\"teen reads\\" with characters who endure the hardships of high school, it is so much more. Through journal entries written by Charlie, the main character, the reader discovers that what is written in Charlie's journal is not a retelling of the prosaic drama that occures in the halls of high school. It is thought provoking and inspiring. The intospective prose enables the reader not only to understand the lives and feelings of others, but of themself. It is a book that should definitely be read by anyone in that is in high school or college.
B00009AOBI|5.0|It was really good. It was sad that people could be so cold hearted and make fun of him whenever they were not in his shoes. I rate that as the best movie based on a true story could be thank you.
0440211727|5.0|This book is so fast paced and exciting it's impossible to put down. This is a rare book that combines exciting court room drama, intense action, and has enough tension in between that stuff to keep you up. This book really attacks some southern issues and doesn't shy awy from the gory details. Really just a top notch book that doesn't let up. The emotion in this book is what feuls it toward it's exciting finish. It is a book i would recommend reading if you are sick of boring books.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Aaaah Brave New World.....Iron Maiden's post-80's swansong <br /> <br />After the (IMHO very good, but often disliked) X Factor, and the fairly average Virtual XI, Iron Maiden got rid of Blaze Bayley, re-recruited Bruce DIckinson and Adrian Smith, and set about rekindling their glory days. <br /> <br />This album is often cited as the best since Seventh Son. I must agree, on Brave New World we hear a band that doesn't sound like they're creatively spent, as so many other 80's bands do today (*cough* Metallica on St Anger). Instead, Brave New World is refreshing; inspiring, and a warning sign to all other new releases from old outfits. On this album, Iron Maiden show that they can still write epic songs, and fill out an album with them. When so many thought their glory days ended in 1988, Maiden fight back on Brave New World <br /> <br />The tracks for this album are all masterpieces; no filler at all and no track is worth skipping for its quality (perhaps your 'mood' might justify skipping a track or two). From the rocking opening of 'The Wicker Man' to the echoing out of 'The Thin Line Between Love and Hate', you hear Maiden at its best. All the boys bring out some of their best work; The harder and faster Wicker Man, Mercenary, Out of the Silent Planet and Fallen Angel. The more progressive Brave New World, Ghost of the Navigator, Dream of Mirrors, Nomad, Blood Brothers. Not a single song is subpar. <br /> <br />Bruce sounds breathtaking; his vocals are his best performance with Maiden since Seventh son, 12 years before. He doesn't sound like he's in his 40's here, the Thin Line still makes me shiver. <br /> <br />The Three guitar lineup seems to have spurred the boys to new songwriting talent; sure some may think 3 guitars unnecessary, but at that stage of their careers there was no need to 'fire' Gers just because Smith came back, and that wouldn't have been very fair to Janick, who sat out the tougher 90's period. <br /> <br />All in all, BUY THIS ALBUM. It's agreat chronicle of a rejuvenated band. Slightly better than the follow up Dance of Death, the songs on this album are beautiful beginning to end and it sounds like Maiden are having fun again! May they give us many more great albums like this! Metallica, Slayer; take note. Iron Maiden have produced a new album that you'll be hard pressed to top; they don't sound old and tired...
B00003CWN3|4.0|This movie is great in many aspects. The actors, music, emotions - it's all there. Yes, it makes you think about sexual discrimination, about love and hate and the challanges kids in rural places are facing. The movie is clearly well done, it stresses you hard, the scenes stay in your head. It's all true.<br /><br />But there is one problem. This movie is so straightforward. After watching the first five minutes you pretty much can guess what will happen at the end. And this is exactly what happens. The movie is based on a true story and it does look like a documentary. There are not tricks, no surprises. There are a few good guys, a lot of bad guys. Bad guys are stronger. They win. There is one tragic love and a little bit of hope in the end. Everything is predetermined and there is no escape. Maybe some slim chance.<br /><br />If you've never been in poor rural places, that would be an eyeopener for you, but most people are familiar with that feeling already. Just pretend you're a weird kid in a local ghetto. You know what they are gonna do to you, huh? Do you really want to watch it on TV?
B000063DHL|5.0|Somewhere in Time is another of Maiden's golden albums (from Number of the Beast to Seventh Son), yet perhaps the most overlooked of them all. The reason? I have no idea; maybe because it only has one song that ever seems to make it onto 'best of' albums (like best of the beast); that song? Wasted Years. And the fact that no song from this album seems to be regularly played as part of the band's setlist; whereas songs from Number of the Beast, Powerslave, Seventh Son, Piece of Mind are staple live items. <br /> <br />Don't be dissuaded; I was apprehensive when I bought this album for that very reason. Yet one listen and I was reassured; this is a wonderful album without a single sub-par song. It begins Maiden's two-album use of synthesisers to 'fatten out' the sound of the songs. I must say it works very well; I personally barely notice the synths anyway but they do make the sound more full than on previous works. <br /> <br />Somewhere in Time is somewhat of an anomaly where writing is concerned; this is often cited as 'Adrian Smith's' album, since he is involved on several of the tracks (notably Wasted Years and Stranger in a STrange land). Truly, we get to see how good Adrian smith's writing talent is on these tracks. But there's offerings from everybody, except (oddly) Bruce (and of course Nicko) - perhaps the quality was so good from everybody else that he had to wait until Seventh Son for his contributions. It makes no difference, Bruce's vocal performance is absolutely incredible on this album. <br /> <br />I won't go into detail about all the individual songs; all are great. BUT don't overlook the oft-ignored 'Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner'. I often play this song in my head whenever I'm running any long distance (how ironic), and its very uplifting. It has some great guitar work and I love the harmonies at the start, middle and end of the song. The subject matter often baffles people, but Steve Harris based it on a BOOK. That's right, by Alan Stilletoe (I may have misspelt the surname - i don't have the book here). Its a short novel about a convict who ends up running in a marathon and 'throws' the race just to frustrate somebody he doesn't like.. <br /> <br />That's a really bad summary but it gives you some idea about the  track. Its got a weird and long title, but its awesome and I urge you to give it a listen. <br /> <br />All in all, a superb album with incredible songs and should NEVER be overlooked in your Maiden collection. <br /> <br />P.S. study the cover for lots of great allusions to other Maiden works and trivia (eg the 'Ancient Mariner' restaurant) <br /> <br /> <br />Every track on this album is great; the excellent and almost operatic 'caught somewhere in time' is a great opener. Wasted Years has a memorable chorus that just makes you want to live for today (as lame as that sounds); a great Adrian Smith song.
B000002GOZ|3.0|If you are a Bryan Adam's fan then this is a must buy for you. It is a live CD and therefore the songs have a different twist compared to his studio-recorded CDs. There is little talking and audience applause which I found nice. I just recently purchased this CD and I wondered why I didn't buy it sooner.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Catch me if I am wrong!! Doesn't the tempo change on \\"Here Today\\" starting at 1:47 and then the circus-esque theme totally remind you of \\"Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" On Sgt. Peppers?! For real!! And what about the bass on \\"God Only Knows?!\\" How many times did the Beatles use that? OK, I agree that Sgt. Peppers is better, but ONLY after they (admittedly) dissected Pet Sounds.... So buy both. Had Brian Wilson been able to stay consistent, he could've been better than the Beatles.

B000007SPU|5.0|It is still hard to believe this album was made and released in the early mid 1980's.  It is so completely against the grain of the stereotypes of that time in that decade.  So, as a result, when this was printed by then indie label 4AD, it became a startlingly original and instant classic album of a certain niche in underground culture.<br /><br />First, there's the cover art - a distorted image of what appears to be some sort of vampiric creature.  And that's really what the album kind of sounds like and why it had so much appeal to the \\"goth\\" or \\"gothic\\" underground.  The album sounds like the collected anthems of an immortal creature.  Something that was raised in another country perhaps, in splendour, then lived on and on.  The clashingly classic and eloquent first tracks on the album are like a trip down memory lane for an old vampire.  Then we hit some more energetic, 80's rock type material for the modern age of the undead creature.  I can see someone listening to this and then reading Anne Rice.  Wait, actually I DID see that in my childhood because my brother was a 80's goth in California!  He now watches Invader Zim and does design work.<br /><br />Regardless, it was in large part due to this album that I realized music didn't have to be the top 40 on the radio.  I later discovered my own bands like Sonic Youth and Flying Saucer Attack yet I still give a nod to the This Mortal Coil experience.  There really is NOTHING like this album that I can think of and I've heard a lot of music as a radio dj myself.  If you think you're ready for an original listening experience then I invite you to try Filigree & Shadow.<br /><br />Highlights include : Ivy and Neet, the hard to pronounce \\"Thais\\", Strength of Strings - and the goth girl anthem \\"Come Here My Love.\\"<br /><br />If you like this band you might like:<br /><br />Harold Budd<br /><br />Aphex Twin<br /><br />Nine Inch Nails<br /><br />Bauhaus
B0002XVQNU|5.0|After the massively successful big screen releases of \\"X-Men\\" and \\"Spider-Man\\", the comic book movie craze began its resurgence in popularity at the hands of Marvel Comics, after suffering from several years of dormancy at the hands of DC Comics. It's no doubt that most eyes were on Marvel for which of their famous superheroes would the next summer blockbuster take its inspiration from? The answer would come in the form of Marvel's crimson-clad hero of New York's Hell's Kitchen, none other than Daredevil.    Known as \\"The Man without Fear\\", Daredevil (Ben Affleck) patrols the area known as \\"The Kitchen\\" with superhuman abilities granted to him during a tragic accident in his youth that left him blinded. As Daredevil works diligently to clean up the streets, his alter-ego Matt Murdock is finding love for the first time in a mysterious woman named Elektra (Jennifer Garner), while still trying to put as many criminals behind bars in his daily life as a lawyer alongside his long-time friend, Franklin \\"Foggy\\" Nelson (Jon Favreau). However, as hard as Matt/Daredevil tries to protect his city, it seems he is fighting a never-ending battle as more and more criminals are being loosed onto the streets. The more villains' Daredevil encounters, the more he begins to come to the realization that someone else may be orchestrating his city's descent into darkness... a man known as The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan).    When \\"Daredevil\\" was released to theaters I was instantly excited to see it after waiting for so long for comic books to once again have their time to shine on the silver screen. With the excellence found in the \\"Spider-Man\\" and \\"X-Men\\" series of films, I had very high expectations that Marvel would not let me down with their next heroic film. In my opinion, after seeing both the theatrical release and the Director's Cut, released later on DVD and Blu-ray, I have to say that Marvel has once again successfully made another of their famous heroes come to life for comic book fans the world over to enjoy.    Writer and director Mark Steven Johnson (\\"Ghost Rider\\") found himself in a rather unenviable position in my estimation, having to write the screenplay for Daredevil, and also helm the film as well. I'm surprised that Mark chose to tackle both jobs, after all here's a man who by all accounts was an experienced screenwriter with such hits as \\"Grumpy Old Men\\" and \\"Grumpier Old Men\\", but as a director he was mostly untested. Not to mention when it came to the realm of superheroes, the films he had previously written and/or directed don't exactly scream \\"Experience!\\" Even though he was lacking experience (in my opinion), I would have to say Mark Steven Johnson did a surprisingly good job of crafting a semi-realistic version of a blind superhero, not the easiest task as I said a moment ago. I enjoyed that Mark chose to make this a darker superhero film, not going for the light and family-friendly feel of \\"Spider-Man\\". Daredevil is a hero that is much more violent, and at times willing to come awfully close to crossing the line between hero and villain, more so than many of the other heroes in Marvel's comic books. So, I appreciated that when all was said and done, Mark chose to have \\"Daredevil\\" remain reasonably loyal to the source material, something that many others before him had failed to do, which is why so many other comic book movies of the eighties and nineties never worked out as well as they could have.    As much as I enjoyed \\"Daredevil\\", I must admit that it is far from being a perfect movie. Although the problems that I have with the movie are not the biggest, or come close to ruining the experience, I feel they do merit at least a mention. For starters in the early portion of the movie, it seems as if Mark wasn't sure exactly how he wanted to handle the movie, whether he wanted it to be a serious, dark exploration of a more tortured hero (similar to \\"Batman Begins\\") or if he wanted to play up the humor and more comicbook-like feel of superhero movies of the early nineties (in the vein of \\"Batman Forever\\" or \\"Batman & Robin\\"). Also a few times it seemed as if Mark couldn't resist the use of cheesy feeling close-ups during pivotal line readings, for instance when Matt tells Foggy that he can't go out and drink because, in his own words, \\"I have work to do.\\" With those words you just imagine the director saying, and \\"Cue close-up on Ben... perfect!\\" As I said earlier, these moments are nothing but pure cheese and prove to be ultimately unnecessary to drive home the point that Matt's a hero with a mission. Thankfully, these annoying close-ups disappeared after the first thirty minutes; however, there were a few other gripes I had sprinkled throughout the movie's duration.    The other set of gripes I had with \\"Daredevil\\" centers around the overuse of wirework for many of the action sequences. I know that wirework is commonplace on movie sets for action set pieces; however, when the work is either too obvious or too exaggerated it tends to take away from the scenes. This occurs numerous times in the film, first when Matt and Elektra have their confrontation/conversation in the park. While the scene is a lot of fun, the wirework was obvious during several moments within the scene. Later on in the film when Daredevil confronts Bullseye in the church both men make impossibly large leaps throughout the entire fight. Now, I understand that this is a film based upon a comic book series, and yes, Daredevil does have superhuman abilities which may allow for him to be able to jump higher (which is kind of discussed early on in the film). However, Bullseye, as far as I can tell, is nothing more than an experienced marksman, and doesn't have any kind of superhuman agility or anything of that nature, so for him to make the same size of leaps as Daredevil causes a problem for me, and draws attention to the far too exaggerated wirework being employed.    With my gripes out of the way, I will nowmove onto the actors performances within the film. Ben Affleck has never been one to be considered one of the finer actors of his generation; however, in this film he does surprisingly well with every facet of the character. Not to mention the fact that he's playing a blind person, which cannot be easy for an actor, because no longer are they allowed to use their eyes to assist them in communicating what they may be feeling internally or just to connect with the other actor(s) within the scene. Personally, I still find it surprising that so many people chide Ben for his performance here; I think it's a good performance, and for him it's one of the better ones in his career. Alongside Ben, actress Jennifer Garner (\\"13 Going on 30\\") was an excellent choice for Daredevil's significant other, Elektra. Elektra's arc was similar to that of her comic book counterpart's, and without going into any detail (for those that haven't seen the movie), the sort of \\"transformation\\", as it were, that her character goes through over the course of the film was very well done, and Jennifer handled the two different aspects of her character perfectly.    In the supporting cast we have Jon Favreau (\\"The Replacements\\" and director of \\"Iron Man\\") as Franklin \\"Foggy\\" Nelson, Matt Murdock's partner at his law firm. Jon was hilarious as Foggy (as he's commonly known in the comics), providing the lion's share of the humor within this otherwise gritty, dark superhero film. Thankfully, the Director's Cut of \\"Daredevil\\" featured even more of Jon as Foggy, which made him a more rounded out character, rather than someone that just pops up every once in a while to provide a little comic relief. Academy Award nominated actor Michael Clarke Duncan portrays the film's primary villain, The Kingpin. Although in the comics Kingpin is generally a Caucasian male, for the film the decision was made to go with Michael due to a couple of factors. One, the sheer size of Michael was a good match for Kingpin's, and secondly, because Michael had the acting chops to be able to convincingly make such a large, somewhat heavy set man appear even more menacing than some other actors may be capable. Kingpin's role was another one that benefited greatly from the Director's Cut, as several portions of his storyline were cut for time and rating constraints. After watching his additional scenes that were added back in, Kingpin's story works so much better in the grand scheme of the film, and doesn't feel nearly as tacked on as it once did. Lastly, Colin Farrell as Bullseye was absolutely perfect. Colin played Bullseye the only way he could be, as nothing more than a cold-blooded killer with a semi-obsessive compulsive approach to murder. You could tell when watching the movie that Colin was relishing every moment he had onscreen, and while Bullseye isn't exactly heavily featured in the film, his scenes definitely stand out as favorites for me within the movie. I would have liked for Bullseye to have been the primary villain for either this movie or a sequel, as he has carried many issues within the comic books easily as the lead villain. Basically, a little more detail on both Bullseye and Kingpin in this movie or a sequel, would have been nice.    All complaints aside, and for the record my complaints didn't really take away too much from my enjoyment of this film, \\"Daredevil\\" is still among my favorites for superhero movies. While it's not a perfect film, \\"Daredevil\\" makes a very strong effort at bringing one of the more difficult comic book characters to life on the big screen.    \\"Daredevil\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, and sensuality.  \\"Daredevil: The Director's Cut\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B0008ISM40|2.0|I've been a huge NIN fan for years and gone out and bought all trent's releases ... except this album. Why, because Trent deserves lower sales on this. Half the songs sound like The Fragile: disc 3, which isn't a bad thing - but the rest is unashamedly commercial, an attempt to do something MTV / radio friendly. Dave Grohl's drumming doesn't lend well to NIN. There's nothing on this album that smacks of experimentation or creativity like previous NIN work and it's obvious at this point in Trents career that he will never find a new lyrical slant. There are good tracks here - Every Day Is Exactly the Same, Right Where It Belongs, amongst others. Personally I aint buying until Trent puts something original out again - and if I have to wait another five years I'll have given up on him.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|After the enormous success of \\"X-Men\\", Fox Studios couldn't wait to get director Bryan Singer back behind the camera on another adventure of Marvel's popular team of mutants.  Yet before going off half-cocked and just throwing a sequel together, several key elements must first come together. The first thing that is key to most sequels' success is getting the original film's cast back together, once that is accomplished a great script must be on hand that equals, and hopefully surpasses the original film's story, and third, the budget must always be better, especially for a film of this magnitude.  Luckily, Fox Studios and Bryan Singer accomplished all of this, and so audiences worldwide were presented with an incredible sequel with \\"X2: X-Men United\\". <br /> <br />\\"X2: X-Men United\\" basically picks up where \\"X-Men\\" left off, Wolverine is still searching for where he comes from, Magneto is still locked inside his plastic prison, Mystique is masquerading as Senator Kelly, and Professor Xavier and the rest of the X-Men are trying to ensure peace between humans and mutants.  This time though, the threat to humanity is not solely evil mutants, this time the threat is humanity, as a renegade general named, Stryker (Brian Cox), is determined to see all mutants dead or dying, and if some normal people get in the way, so be it.  The X-Men must gather together and team-up with Magneto and Mystique to stop this mutant massacre or all hope will be lost. <br /> <br />\\"X2: X-Men United\\" gave audiences everything they loved about the original film, and more.  More action, an even bigger, more dramatic story, more special effects, and more mutants.  In \\"X2: X-Men United\\" audiences were introduced to the teleporting mutant Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), also Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro were given more screen time, and several other recognizable mutants made cameos; such as, Colossus, Siren, and Kitty Pryde. <br /> <br />\\"X2: X-Men United\\" simply put, was just an incredible film, and builtbrilliantly on what \\"X-Men\\" had started.  Now all we can do is hope that when \\"X3\\" comes to theaters in 2006, it will carry on the already impressive legacy, that \\"X-Men\\" and \\"X2: X-Men United\\" has created. <br /> <br />\\"X2: X-Men United\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and minor sensuality.
B00063MBU8|1.0|the average customer rating for this worthless piece of garbage is most definitely not 4 of 5. look for yourself how many people have rated this with a one and i dare you to disagree with me. the point is, this pathetic excuse for a band must be stopped from producing any more musical pollution. i have been unfortunate enough to hear a few songs from this cd. after listening, i immediately felt the urge to jump from the car in which i was riding. buy yourself some magic lima beans or something but for the sake of saving music from suffient dreadfullness, do not waste a single peso on this ultimate piece of filth.
B00005JKC3|2.0|Back in 2003, when Ang Lee's blockbuster turned box office flop \\"Hulk\\" was initially released to theaters, I was a fan of the movie. I thought that the movie had received some unfounded hatred in the eyes of moviegoers and even comic book fans for that matter, and I couldn't understand what their problems were with the movie. I had watched the movie several times since its debut, and still found myself enjoying it (although I will admit the origin was beginning to get a little old after awhile). In fact I had owned the movie up until recently; this is no longer the case due to a recent viewing of the movie in an effort to psyche myself up for the recently released to theaters \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" starring Edward Norton in the title role (previously played by Eric Bana). After that most recent viewing, I finally discovered why so many people have hated this movie, and now I wonder how it was that I didn't see the problems before.    \\"Hulk\\" is the story of Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), a scientist specializing in the field of gamma radiation. While working on ways to use gamma radiation to heal wounds for soldiers along with fellow scientist/former girlfriend Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), Bruce through a series of unfortunate circumstances, finds himself doused with radiation. Though he should be dead from radiation poisoning, something inside Banner has allowed him to survive, but in the process that special \\"something\\" has unleashed a monster inside of him that had been hidden there all along, turning Bruce Banner into the rampaging Hulk. Now, Bruce must try to find a way to rid himself of this monstrous Hulk inside of him, while trying his best to evade capture at the hands of Betty's zealous father General Ross (Sam Elliott) whose superiors want to use the Hulk as a weapon for the U.S. military.    Here's where things went wrong for me with \\"Hulk\\", to begin with I pulled my copy of \\"Hulk\\" off my DVD shelf and stuck it in the DVD player expecting to enjoy it once more. Much to my surprise I found myself completely bored out of my mind during the insanely long and extremely bloated origin sequence that sucks all of the life out of the first hour of the movie. Now, I remember when I had watched this movie numerous times before I had felt that the origin could have used some trimming to make it move at a faster, more exciting pace; yet I had still enjoyed all the detail that had been worked into the story to explain the intense psychological damage that had been done to young Bruce Banner throughout his childhood that would one day lead to him becoming the monstrous Hulk. For some reason I no longer enjoyed the opening origin scenes, which I think has to do with the fact that I had seen it enough already, plus the origin didn't really match up with that of the comics all that much, but I was hoping to still enjoy the action scenes during the last half of the film where Banner becomes Hulk.    So, I continued watching only to discover even more disappointment when I realized how much I didn't care about the action scenes due to the opening hour draining every ounce of interest I had previously held in the film's proceedings. The action sequences are still energetic and fun to watch, and in some instances perfectly capture some of the greatest battles in the long history of Hulk comic books. I wasn't all that surprised that the battles were staged in such an epic manner given Ang Lee's previous film had been the martial arts epic \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", but his penchant for flashy visuals led to questionable editing techniques that were meant to resemble comic book panels, but became too distracting and jarring to enjoy. Also, why did Ang Lee choose to film moss covered rocks and various plant life in and around the desert, instead of moving the film along to prevent boredom from setting in for the audience? Whatever the reason, Ang Lee wasted way too much time focusing on the film's environments when he should have beenmore concerned with getting the Hulk on screen faster and more often, or finding a consistent size and color for Hulk's CGI rendering.    The computer generated Hulk was impressive upon first glance, but upon further inspection one begins to notice how inconsistent his appearance is throughout the entire last half of the film once he makes his debut. The color of green used for the Hulk's skin goes from a dullish green to a bright green, back to a dullish green yet again and this continues between every scene the Hulk is in, and sometimes the color shifts during one scene several times. As if that inconsistency wasn't enough, the size of the Hulk changes from scene to scene, at times the size change made sense within the film's storyline which called for Hulk's size to increase the madder he got, and other times the size change just seemed to shift depending on which camera angle was being used; however, the size change of Hulk was just another aspect of the movie that differs from the comic books. In the comics, Hulk's size didn't change the angrier he got; he merely got stronger and stronger. At one point the Hulk's size was so gigantic that he was as tall as some full grown trees surrounding Betty's house, and these weren't small trees by any means, no these were as tall if not taller than her house (which may have been two stories, though that's inconsequential). I don't understand why Ang Lee, and the computer wizards he employed to bring the Hulk to life, didn't notice these glaringly obvious inconsistencies, and try to rectify them at some point in the post-production process; but they didn't, and we were left with a movie that is so full of distractions in the visual effects department that the action scenes were no longer exciting, just disappointing.    The acting was solid, and was probably the best aspect of the entire movie. Eric Bana (\\"Troy\\") was a good Bruce Banner at the time, although after seeing Ed Norton's performance in \\"The Incredible Hulk\\", Bana's performance pales in comparison. Jennifer Connelly (\\"A Beautiful Mind\\") was a great choice for Betty Ross, Bruce's love interest in the film; she portrays Betty as a woman who is conflicted over her feelings for Bruce, yet is determined to stand by his side. She loves the man, but is angered by the fact that science always seemed to take precedence over her needs; however, once Banner became Hulk, she put aside her conflicted emotions in order to be there for him when he needed her most. Sam Elliott (\\"The Golden Compass\\") was a perfect choice to bring General \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross to life on the big screen, his performance was one that commanded respect from all around, and yet he could still be vulnerable to his only weakness, his daughter Betty. Josh Lucas (\\"Glory Road\\") was decent as one of the villains in the movie, a sniveling weasel of a human being named Glen, who desires Betty and is willing to do whatever it takes to get her and her research to himself. Rounding out the cast is a rather disheveled looking Nick Nolte, who apparently felt his appearance in his infamous mug shot from a few years ago, was a great look as he kept it for this movie and also his upcoming appearance in the Ben Stiller action comedy \\"Tropic Thunder\\". Nick's performance as Banner's deranged, semi-mad scientist father was interesting to watch; although, I didn't appreciate the way he became the primary villain in the movie. The decision to turn Nick's character into an \\"absorbing man\\" to confront the Hulk in the film's climactic sequence seemed a little bit tacked on, giving me the feeling that the writers had kind of run out of ideas for having the military be the primary antagonists, and were in need of some kind of a way out of the corner they had painted themselves into.    Ang Lee's wannabe superhero epic \\"Hulk\\" could have been, and truly should have been, a visual effects extravaganza, full of intense battles, adventure, a little comedy, some drama, and even a few dangling plot lines left somewhat unresolved to lead into what should have been the inevitable sequel. However, a far too in depth and poorly paced origin sequence that doesn't even stay true to the source material, inconsistent visual effects work on the Hulk, and an ill-conceived final act made this potential blockbuster into a gigantic flop that has not been easily forgotten.    \\"Hulk\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief nudity.
B000021YQV|5.0|My first mistake was prejudgeing S>O>A>D. When I first heard the song Chic n st (Steal this album) I thought that they were a mess. Then, I decided to give them one more chance. I discovered my new favorite album. Toxicity was like nothing I had ever heard. My Dad even liked it! Here are the songs:  <br />  <br />1. Prison Song- Haedcore, crazy, funny, political, what you expect from these guys 8/10 <br /> <br />2.Needles- Possibly one of the weirdest songs I have ever heard. Some of those hot European beats and heavy to the core. 7/10 <br /> <br />3. Deer Dance- The heaviest song on the album. More noise than I like. 6/10 <br /> <br />4. Jet Piolet- Oh my god. Too much to take in. 4/10 <br /> <br />5. X- The most nderated song on the album. 8/10 <br /> <br />6. Chop Suey- Usually, I don't like singles, but damn this one is good. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Bounce- Something to jump around too. Fun and exciting. <br /> <br />8. Forest- My second favorite on the album. 10/10 <br /> <br />9. Atwa- Don't have a clue what it's about, but I like it. 7/10 <br /> <br />10 Science- Nice opening, butthe whole spirit takes away from the whole point of the song. 7/1o <br /> <br />11. Toxicity- The king of the album. Also my favorite. 20/10 <br /> <br />12.Psyhco- Amazing. Simply amazing. 9/10 <br /> <br />13.

B00028HBKM|5.0|As most people know by now, last year one of the most controversial films of the year was, \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", personally as a Christian, I don't get what was so controversial about this film, I think that even if I was a non-believer I wouldn't think this film was controversial.  The only controversial thing I can see Hollywood getting upset over is the fact that Mel Gibson, chose to give the story of Jesus' final 12 hours the respect they deserve by truthfully, Biblically, and accurately depicting the events leading up to the crucifixion. <br /> <br />\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" chronicles the final 12 hours of Jesus Christ, from the moment he was taken into custody all the way up to the crucifixion and resurrection.  In that time we, the audience, get to see realistically what Jesus went through according to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.   <br /> <br />Many critics felt the film was overly gory and grotesque in the way the scourging and crucifixion was portrayed.  I beg to differ, the scourging was in line with the way Romans punished criminals, or in this case perceived criminals, and the crucifixion was portrayed very realistically.  To ask Mel Gibson to not show the agony and torture Jesus endured to save mankind, would be a disservice to Mel's beliefs and the beliefs of other Christians, and Jesus himself.  No director has ever shown this level of detail when depicting Christ's sacrifice for us, and that is a testament unto Mel Gibson for being so courageous. <br /> <br />\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is a brilliantly directed film, and Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus was the most human portrayal of the Savior that I have ever witnessed.  Of course, the story was incredible and stayed faithful to the Biblical accounts in the Gospels.  Do not let the controversy surrounding this film keep you away, I believe everyone should see what Christ went through for us all. <br /> <br />\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is rated R for violence.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|It appears that the Foo Fighters have officially jumped on board the \\"Protect the Poor Artists from Evil Copyright Infrigement\\" wagon with this new album.  <br /> <br />While the tunes are good -- the first CD far better than the second in the set -- nothing ticks off a fan more than being told where they can and can not listen to their music. So, not being able to take the $15 CD I'd just bought and load it onto my iPod to enjoy on my long plane ride, started me asking myself if I really wanted to follow this band any further. I do love their music, and I do understand why protecting artists rights to original material is an issue, but I don't want anyone telling me that in order to listen to their music I have to sequester myself in the car or next to my home stereo in order to hear it.  <br /> <br />Music is about freedom and enjoyment, not about laws and restrictions. From now on, any music I buy will be through iTunes, so that I can listen on my iPod or burn my own copy and go on with my life -- wherever that takes me, even if it is away from *gasp* a physical CD player.  <br /> <br />With regard to the music itself--the first CD is good, ok, it's great. I loved it as soon as I remembered to put it in the car and had the presence of mind to load it in the changer and press \\"Play\\". The second one was a waste of the energy expended getting it out of the case. Lame, slow, kinda folksy and whiney. I skipped from song to song looking for a vestige of hope, but alas there was none. Each song sounded like the last and, in this case, that was not good.  <br /> <br />Since you're forced to carry around a physical copy of this album, do yourself a favor and throw out the second CD, it'll be lighter while you're lugging it around -- if you choose to at all.

B00025ETIW|1.0|I tried so hard, in so many ways not to sound mean as hell, but there's no other way to put this.    About a year ago, I ordered around 30 CDs from Amazon.com, and around 75% were punk albums. All from bands like The Starting Line, Brand New, Yellowcard!, etc. I ordered roughly 2 CDs for every punk band. And ya know what? Out of those 30 CDs, the only good ones were from Smashing Pumpkins, a rap group, and a metal band. Yep, you read that correctly. It's pretty damn sad that I would rather listen to Come Clean by Hilary Duff than this crap (and oh how I do!). 95% of this jaded genre sounds the same, and this is no exception. If punk music were a person, it would be Judas, betraying the holy savior Jesus Christ left and right like it was its job. I'm not exaggerating. And the worse part of this crap is \\"screamo\\". I'm pretty sure they have a name for garbage like that, it's called \\"Don't scream into the microphone, dumbass\\". C'mon, if you actually like that shiz, why not turn goth and listen to death metal? Gothics don't like computers anyway, they're like the amish. If you are new to punk music, Saves the Day and Blink 182 are so far the only punk bands that don't have less than or equal to 3 good songs, although I've heard good things about Sunny Day Real Estate and Thrice. Whoops! Those probably aren't punk bands, right? They're like xxElephantitusCORE right? My mistake, thoough, correct me if you'd like. Speaking of less than or equal to 3 good songs, that's what this album is. Let me list them for you:. Don't believe me? Buy this CD and be disappointed. Actually, seems like you guys like bad music. Myself, I'm not really into sucky music, but there's a lot of diehard fans of it out there. Bottom line: Punk music, emo, screamo, punkcore, emocore, screamocore and screamoemocore all blow, in general.    I actually wasn't going to post this because it has such a mean tone, but then I delved deep into the cunning, articulated archive of amazon.com reviews of this album to read some of the evaluations: \\"Absolutely Amazing- Tell All Your Friends About This\\", \\"Simply the BEST!!!\\", and \\"just buy the CD, its so amazing i cant even explain. yes. it really is that good.\\" Yeah, how about you guys take some ritalin and get a clue. If this is the best thing you've ever heard, there's no hope anymore. Obi-Wan died in Return of the Jedi, so you guys are on your own. But this one really got to me: \\"genius!!\\". No, it's not genius, trust me. I will give you a lifetime guarantee that this CD is not genius. Genius is the ending to Donnie Darko and The Thomas Crown Affair. Genius is putting junk mail in other junk mail's envelopes they come in and sending it back. Genius is Final Fantasy 7. Genius is not this album. Trust me.     If you like punk music, or want to get into it, here's some good punk songs to listen to:    The Ataris - In This Diary  The Ataris - I Won't Spend Another Night Alone  The Exit - Susan  AFI - Girl's Not Grey  Saves the Day - Jukebox Breakdown  Saves the Day - Nightingale  Saves the Day - This is Not an Exit  Saves the Day - Holly Hox, Forget Me Nots  Saves the Day - Certain Tragedy  Saves the Day - The Last Lie I Told  Blink 182 - Going Away to College  Blink 182 - Don't Leave Me  Blink 182 - Mutt  Blink 182 - Anthem Part Two  Blink 182 - Shut Up  Blink 182 - Emo  Blink 182 - Degenerate  Blink 182 - Here's Your Letter  Screeching Weasel - Kamala's Too Nice  The Ramones - Hey Ho, Let's Go!  The Ramones - Sheena Is A Punkrocker  Green Day - Longview  Green Day - I Fought the Law (I think this versions better than the original)  New Found Glory - Belated  New Found Glory - Dressed to Kill  New Found Glory - 2's and 3's  Yellowcard! - Octobor Nights  The Sex Pistols - Anarchy in the UK    AND, if you're into emo (terrible label btw), Dashboard Confessional's really the only way to go:    Dashboard Confessional - The Good Fight, Bend and Not Break, Carve Your Heart Out Yourself, Hey Girl, Hands Down (Both versions are prettygood), Warmth of the Sand, Several Ways to Die Trying, and the So Impossible [EP].    You're welcome. All you 14 year old punks out there who fight valiantly for independence, antagonistic ideals, freedom and fun with your heads held high, have fun with all those songs (except Blink 182, cause you know, they were good till they got mainstream, making the music we all loved by them inevitably terrible at that moment). Hope that revolution comes soon. Also, this review was originally written for a Taking Back Sunday CD, but they're all the same and I hate this band more.

0446677450|5.0|I had to write a review for this book for 2 major reasons.  <br />1. This book has without a doubt been one of the most inspirational and life changing books that I personally have ever read. <br />2. The negative reviews from people who have missed the concept. This book gets a lot of criticism that I think is undeserved <br /> <br />This book, for some, will definitely change your life.  The information within this book is simple, to the point, and right on the money.  This book was intended to plant a seed, and hopefully inspire you to look at ways you can take action.  It is not a \\"how to\\" or \\"get rich quick\\" book.  I think that for the majority of us out there financial literacy is a new concept because it is something that is not taught in school (especially public school).   <br /> <br />Financial literacy is the main point of this book.   <br /> <br />Why do you have people that are in there 50's, 60's, and 70's coming back to the work force?  I recommend this book to everyone that I talk to who are looking at changing their current financial position.  He doesn't go into any specific detail but it will open your eyes and will have you think of ways to make your money work for you instead of the other way around.   <br /> <br />If you are reading this review I would challenge you while you are reading this book to keep an open mind and make your own decision on how you personally can implement some or all of the concepts described within it. <br />

B00005JN0T|4.0|Will Smith is Del Spooner, a robot hater.  He works as a homocide detective and the movie begins as he receives a call from a hologram machine alerting him that his friend Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell) has died.  Spooner immediately suspects that this was not a suicide, but a murder committed by one of Lanning's robot creations.  From here, the movie packs exploration of Asimov's 3 robot laws in between some really good action scenes.  Although it does not adhere to any of Asimov's tales, it incorporates the ideas of several of them throughout the film to a satisfying result for the Asimov fan. <br /> <br />Overall, it was a really fun popcorn flick that managed to include some of the more interesting questions about man vs. machinery that have been raised in the sci-fi genre.  Two thumbs up.

Particularly helpful if like me there is a lot of sea between you and the hip challenging yummy place!<br /><br />I love the cupcakes from here particularly because they speak to me of America and set my memories of great holidays in the US completely free! I love British cakes too but they are different in style, size and taste and on my doorstep, this book allows me to get a fix of Magnolia whenever I really have the hankering. If your haven't heard of the Bakery then this is a great book, if you have heard of the place it's a great book! It's Sister book is equally as good and the cupcakes are to die for! Fans of \\"Sex and the City\\", may remember Carrie and Miranda once sitting outside a Bakery eagerly scoffing butter iced yummies, well that was Magnolia, S and the C doing Magnolia in Manolos is praise indeed!
B000021YQV|5.0|Before I actually listened to System of a Down, the only modern rock groups I liked were Green Day and Rage Against the Machine. My best friend listens to SoaD like it's the only thing that matters, which is how I am about 2Pac. I figured since he loves them, I'd try it out. Holy crap, I love this band so much, I can't believe what I've been missing out on. I didn't even have to listen to it a couple times to appreciate it (Like Rage's Battle of L.A.), it was immediately great. In the month that I started listening to it (late May 2005) my whole life changed dramatically from other stuff, and every song on this album made more sense or was there to comfort me.  <br /> <br />1. Prison Song -- 4/5 very political, like Rage is, so I liked that about it. The guitars and drums are great here, but they are in every song on this CD, so I'll leave that part out of the rest of my reviews. The only reason this song got 4/5 is cuz some of the songs are FAR better. <br /> <br />2. Needles -- 5/5 I just started to appreciate this song about heroin, but the vocals and the way the lead singer throws his voice between hard grunts and soft emotion is amazing. <br /> <br />3. Deer Dance -- 5/5 starts off with funny delivery, but its message is relevant. <br /> <br />4. Jet Pilot -- 3/5 this is one of two songs I don't quite get. I never skip over it, I just don't enjoy it as much as the rest of the CD.  <br /> <br />5. X -- 3/5 READ ABOVE <br /> <br />6. Chop Suey! -- 5/5 I never heard this on the radio, but I'll never forget the first time I heard this song and how hard it hit me because of very very close people to me. <br /> <br />7. Bounce -- 4/5 not significant in any way, and I usually skip over this song, but it's fun. I enjoy it with my friends, but never alone. <br /> <br />8. Forest -- 5/5 this song is very poetic and it's one of the more significant and better songs on the CD musically. Great song. <br /> <br />9. Atwa -- 6/5 I'd give it more than six, but that would seemlike a lame thing to do. This is one of the most amazing songs I've ever heard, but it didn't do anything for me the first time. It was after a couple nights of crazy ups and downs that I was driving home and the song made me cry because of its significance to me. <br /> <br />10. Science -- 5/5 I love this song just because it's rare to hear someone diss science blatantly. The message is so strong and so true, and the song just takes over if you listen to it loud enough.  <br /> <br />11. Shimmy -- 4/5 another one of those kind of goofy/kind of relevant songs that I only listen to with my friends. But I love the way he says \\"break of dawn, yeah!\\" The \\"yeah\\" sounds like the South Park creators making fun of hard rockers. Haha. <br /> <br />12. Toxicity -- 5/5 this is the only song I remember hearing on the radio and hearing all throughout the years to come after they stopped playing this. I couldn't appreciate this song until I understood Rage, but I love the sounds of this song. <br /> <br />13. Psycho -- 5/5 THERE'S A SONG ABOUT MY EX-GIRLFRIEND! <br /> <br />14. Aerials -- 5/5 this is one of the more spiritual and might I venture to say religious songs on the album. There's no hard core rock here, just deep meaning. <br /> <br />After it's all said and done, and I listened to this album about three or four times, I realized how strange it was that the combination of its central themes (i.e. drugs and spirituality) works together. Alz i can say iz cop dis album, son.
0684859106|5.0|...and a cracking book with recipes that fill you with a sense of comforting nostalgia as well as deliciously creamy, sugery, crunchy fillings and frostings which comfort your soul and challenge your hips!<br /><br /> The Magnolia has a nostalgic, mid 20th century feel, as do it's recipes and there isn't one here that isn't yummy and isn't realtively easy to produce.<br /><br /> Negative reviews focus on the lack of health and the lack of sophistication of the recipes, but this isn't modern nor prententious cuisine, this is \\"afternoons with Grandma\\" stuff.<br /><br /> I see no harm in feeding your face, your memories and your soul once and a while. Equally, speaknig as an Englishman, these recipes speak to me as much of America as they do of nostalgia, igniting memories of great holidays as well as the joys of what it must have been like to be achild in the 30's 40's and 50's. Cracking stuff, just don't over do it!

B00003JRCQ|5.0|Equally the most underated and this seems to be because the characterisitions are so perfectly spot on. This is afterall the story of a couple who missed their chance at happiness because of being persuaded by the strength of social values and snobbery, so apparant and influencial in this period of history.<br /><br /> They move on to be persuaded by the inaccuracy of opinion proved over time, and persuaded by a slow growing sense of reignited love and passion. Being 19th Century people the simmer slowly over events that would overwhelm and excite modern day folk and the characters are polite and understated.<br /><br /> Root and Hinds are pivotal in driving this drama with accuracy and excellence but the nature of their simmering stoicism has perhaps made this an overlooked drama. It is beautiful in it's comments on the coming good of the human conditon and the historical placement and projection is stunning. Be persuaded to give this a whirl and see, in a sublimely accurate way, the strongest of social comments Austen made on the values of her own time.
0764113496|5.0|I have used the 501 verb books for 3 different languages now, and the series is simply the best.  This book is especially useful in Russian, because not only does it have the full conjugations of all the tenses for each aspect of the verb, but at the bottom of the page it also indicates what case follows that verb, which is very helpful, as it is often hard for one to  figure out what case a verb governs on one's own.  Highly recommended.
6305907145|2.0|...to be up front about elements of history our forebares may well have wished to gloss over, but to expose Auten as one these \\"glossers\\" is not a valid enough reason to muck around  with and ruin, her most biographical work. It may be she glossed over some elements of this story, but that was surely the author's privelage.<br /><br /> I just think if you want to tell another historical story then right your own. Fanny is simply wrong here, gutsy and self defensive. The way distasteful undertones to the story are headlined here and thrust upon us is crass and insulting, an intelligent film would build the tension and ask the viewer to draw their own conclusions, as Austen does in her much better novel. This way we would not have to be boldy told the awful family is a little more than a pack of slave abusers and we would not need Fanny to walk in on people having rampant sex in order to establish who would come good and who would come undone in the novels conclusion. This is Austen's book treated with a hatchet and blunderblust when it needs kid gloves and cotton wool! There are some worthy performances but by and large the film is wrong and a missed opportunity.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is simply the greatest album since 1970's.  It's truly a masterpiece because it's real.  Shame on so many artists giving us rehash crap.  Beck is original.
0553573403|5.0|After years of my girlfriend giving me a hard time about fantasy novels I finally convinced her to give one a try.  I knew instantly that I'd give her Game Of Thrones.  She came to me after the first hour to ask me if all fantasy books were that good (sadly, I had to tell her no, none are and few come even close).  She came to me after six days when she finished this book and went on to the next.  She came to me after four weeks after reading all three books and cursed at me for having her read something so engaging and brilliant that was still years from being completed.<br /><br />If the fantasy genre was rocknroll and Tolkien would be Muddy Waters, Roger Zelazny would be Chuck Berry, Robert Jordan would probably be the Beatles, Robin Hobb would be the Rolling Stones, and George R.R. Martin is the Velvet Underground.  Always inventive, never flinching, poetically oozing with rich images and an impossible ease for making his art.<br /><br />Most fantasy writers fall into a trap of making everything black and white, good versus evil, where all of Martin's characters have strong, yet subtly painted conflicts with morality.  There is no lord of evil here with a name that strikes fear into the hearts of common folk, plotting to destroy mankind without a reason other than simply being the embodiment of evil.<br /><br />However much you want to route food the \\"good\\" guys, their flaws are always there to dog even in their most noble actions.  As soon as your sure the \\"bad\\" are truly bad, Martin will show you a humanity to them to them that is both touching and believable.  And that is what makes the core of good storytelling: Nothing is predictable and (it's sad that this needs to be said about the fantasy genre) nobody does anything without motive.<br /><br />George Martin also has something that almost every other fantasy writer sourly lacks: a great sense of humor.
0312955006|5.0|\\"The concrete blonde\\" is the third book on the Harry Bosch series. After the promising beginning with \\"The black echo\\" and  the confusing but still revealing \\"The black ice\\", Harry Bosch is back in his finest story so far. This time, Connelly has created a great plot, involving a serial killer from the past that seems to have, somehow, been brought to life again, and a civil action against Bosch, lead by a relentless female lawyer.<br /><br />Connelly seems to have an endless imagination to create new characters, and to further develop his usual ones. And he also seems to connect all his stories, not only the ones about Bosch, but also his \\"standalone\\" novels, featuring, for example, Jack McEvoy or Terry McCaleb.<br /><br />Bosch is my present favorite policial character, along with Lehane's Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. He's different, complex and Connelly always comes up with something new to add to his personality. This time the author blends policial procedures and investigation with courtroom drama, and the results are very good.<br /><br />As a last comment, Connelly's endings were his weakest point (based on the 4 books I'd read by this author), but this time he seems to have delivered something more consistent. \\"The concrete blonde\\" is, by a little margin, better than \\"The black echo\\" and this makes it the best of the three first books in this series.<br /><br />Grade 8.9/10
B000002JKA|5.0|This follow-up to IMAGES & WORDS is equally perfect!  The music is still extremely progressive but now with a dark, heavy edge.  The main reason why is John Petrucci began to experiment with the Ibanez 7-string guitar, and was probably the first guitarist to truly maximize it's capabilities, rather than simply using it as a method to sound heavier. <br /> <br />On this release, we begin to hear the infinite musical versatility of this awesome group of musicians.  Most notable is the track 'A Mind Behind Itself' which is actually three separate songs.  The first is the mind-boggling instrumental, 'Erotomania.'  The best way to appreciate this track is to turn off the lights, crank it, and play games where you focus on a specific instrument, and then change your focus after a minute or two.  Repeat this method around 100 times, and you'll begin to grasp the sheer intensity of the music.  This runs into a classic track - 'Voices' which Mike Portnoy points to as his favorite song he has ever written.  After ten minutes or so, we finish with the beautiful ballad, 'The Silent Man.'  If you cannot appreciate the musical versatility of this band, then you are simply an idiot, or an ignorant slave to the barrage of over-produced garbage that comes across the radio waves and MTV.   <br /> <br />One of my all time favorite tracks on this album is 'Scarred' which features the 7-string.  I love it for it's changes from heavy metal to a power ballad within minutes.  The interchanging parts are put together in such a fluid manner, they sound as if they were meant to be there.  My favorite part is the end of the track, where there is an instrumental break that will make you ruin your hand if you ever attempt to play it on the guitar!  If you own this disc, you know exactly what I'm talking about. <br /> <br />We are also hit with an onslaught of heavier music that is lacking on the previous album, on such tracks as 'Caught in a Web,' 'The Mirror,' and 'Lie' which all feature the 7-string guitar, but also include progressive elements that you simply will not hear in any other type of mainstream music...at least nothing on a major record label.   <br /> <br />This album also marks the end of an era, because Kevin Moore would leave the band after it's recording.  This is significant, because Kev grew up with Petrucci and Portnoy and was a major factor in the writing of music, and while he is not as amazing as Jordan Rudess, he is still miles ahead of his replacement, Derrick Sherinian. <br /> <br />I cannnot think of any parts of this album I do not approve of, and if you like IMAGES & WORDS, then you will definitely love AWAKE.  Either of these albums are a great place to start if you are just beginning to build your Dream Theater collection.
6305313687|5.0|I finally got around to seeing American History X tonight after hearing much good hype and it was a great film dealing with ugly issues. Edward Norton deserved the Oscar he was nominated for and I would say this is easily his best performance, followed closely by Fight Club and Primal Fear. Edward Furlong, better known as the whiny kid who played John Connor in Terminator 2: Judgement Day, is surprisingly very good here as well. This is one of those movies that I am mad I spent money to rent when I could own this great film for around $10.00. People of all races should see this realistic film dealing with the \\"stuff\\" few like to discuss in public, but can still be seen throughout the world.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|I thought Constantine was the guy in a rock band who tried out for American Idol what a rip off. But this movie is very good and scary. Keanu Reeves best sence the Matrix.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is the second album from the nu-metal band Linkin Park. I personally think that this album is better than Hybrid Theory. The band has made great leaps and have expanded their sound from just rap-screaming rock, to a wide array of sounds that come together as a whole. Here is a song by song analysis of Meteora.  <br />    Don't Stay- I love this song. Chester Bennington perfectly blends soft verses to loud chorus in this song. The bridge is excellent also.  <br />    Somewhere I Belong- Mike Shinoda does a wonderful job of hip-hopping his way to the first single off this cd. The rhythm of this song is tremendous and Chester's bridge is excellent.  <br />    Lying From You- Another great song. The three opening songs on this cd are tremendous. Mike's verses are injected with rhythm. The chorus is charged up as always, and Chester's screaming while Mike's is bridging sounds great. This is another great song on this cd. <br />    Hit The Floor- This is a heavy song with a kind of hip-hop bounce. Mike's verses are great but I'm not really into the screaming chorus that Chester Bennington brings to the table in this song. Mike's whispering bridge that is riddled with anger is awesome and I love it. This song is not as good as the other's on the cd but it is still really good. <br />    Easier To Run- This song shows the softer side of Linkin Park. The chorus isn't really up to Linkin Park standard in this song. I love Chester's soft voice in the chorus though, and Mike's rapping is really good. The reason that I love this song is that Chester wrote the lyrics with the help of no music and no beat. It was a free-writing exercise and they worked it into this song. This song really symbolizes the hardships that Chester faced growing up and that is why I love it. You can really feel his pain if you listen to the lyrics in the verses. <br />      Faint- I love this song. The beat is up pumped up and fast at nearly 130 beats a minute. Mike's verses are excellent as always. Chester's vocals in this song are amazing. The chorus is the best part of this song. The screaming bridge the Bennington puts on is amazing and shows you how Linkin Park can mend hard rock and heavy metal together seamlessly and make it sound awesome.  <br />      Figure .09- This is my favorite song on the cd. It represents what Linkin Park is in every facet. You have the rapping of Mike in the verses and it is really great. The chorus is the best part of this song to me with Chester being loud but still in tune. The bridge again shows what Linkin Park is all about. Mike rapping with Chester screaming at the end of each line. This is the best song on the cd.  <br />      Breaking The Habit- Oh, I love this song! Mike is absent in this song but Chester makes up for it with great lyrics and a soft voice. The chorus is amazing in this song. The screaming bridge sounds great also. This is one of those songs that took Linkin Park's sound to the next level and made them grow as a band.  <br />      From The Inside- Another good song that is not great. This is probably the softest you will ever hear Chester Bennington in any song. Mike is great in this song. The chorus is the best part of this song. The bridge is really good. What this song does is show how Linkin Park can go from really soft to insanely loud in just a matter of seconds. Good but not great. <br />      Nobody's Listening- This is the worst song on the cd to me. Linkin Park throws a complete curveball at us in this song. You have the element of the Japanese flute along with rapping and screaming. The thing that ties this song in with the rest of the album is the lyrics. Good but not great.  <br />      Session- This is an instrumental song. No lyrics in this one. It is great to listen to when you need to calm down and realax. Good thinking, Linkin Park. <br />      Numb- This is one of the best songs on the cd. Chester's vocals in the verses are amazing. The chorus is great as well. The loud bridge blends in perfectly with the rest of the song. This is another great song on this great album. <br /> <br />    There you have it. The second album from the great Linkin Park. If you have any interest at all in rock you have to have this album. As soon as you read this review, you should go out and buy this cd. Linkin Park really shines in the sophomore set. This is truly a great album.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|Classic! Very cynical of them to take the p#ss out of everyone with this satirical dig at reality TV. I can't wait till they come out and tell everybody. Please, tell me I'm right?! <br /> <br />I could not sit through this pile of crap. It is either the biggest practical joke played on whoever thought this was real or it is the most pathetic display of humanity I've seen! (ok, maybe not the most, but of a rock band for sure). <br /> <br />That 'performance coach' must be some kind of comedy actor, but he is not funny. If he is real then the future is lost. Who would pay money for such an idiot? His comments are inane crap and the \\"yeah, I hear what you're saying\\" looks from the band are......I dunno, mentally retarded! <br /> <br />Is this what a rock'n'roll lifestyle turns a person into? A moron? I can't get my head around this, Metallica are \\"What is and Should Never Be\\". <br /> <br />Give up guys, your families need you to be normal. Unless it was all a joke of course... <br />
0783114222|5.0|I watched this series some years ago, when a friend of mine (CPC) lent it to me. Since then, I wanted to buy it for seeing it again. Finally, I got it from Amazon last year. <br />It is one of the best series I have watched in my life. Let me tell you why. <br />First, it keeps almost all the details from the real story: phrases, words, pictures, sounds, landscapes. It was done with a lot of care. <br />Second, it has some pieces from documentaries so it reminds you about what was happening those years in politics, economy, space policy... and social policies too. <br />Third, it covers many aspects of the space exploration, from the begining to the last Apollo mission with a great performance of the stars and the producers. <br />Fourth, it teaches you a lot of a very important part of mankind's history in an enjoyable way. <br />Finally, I would like to tell you that you musn't miss the last chapter: this one summarizes the spirit of human's exploration, our power of imagination, the many technological challenges that a space mission has and many many other things. <br />It's worth getting it.
B0002ZYE1Y|2.0|I am dumbfounded by the comment \\"lyrics are often left to the interpretation of the listener so if you don't get, make up something.\\"  Is this why Metalicca has been so successful over the past 25 years?  Lyrics need to have a meaning that makes a song.  If you are only going for Nightwish because of their rythms then I am sorry to dissappoint you but their music is NOT original.  It the same old story, a band releases a song over decade before and then a new band steals it and then re-sells it to the next generation that's none the wiser.  <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|I just love Coldplay...and they've put out yet another great album!  I can't wait for the next!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Unbelievable, the best ever, til Henley made his comment about Rupert Murdock prior to Dirty Laundry.  When will you all get over it?  The American People know Sadam had weapons, he used them on his own people.  He was harboring terrorists.!  Why do you rock stars have to be such incompetent losers? And then you try to sing some kind of heartwarming b.s. about 9/11.   We, the people of this great country, voted your people out last November.  And your judges are next.  HELLO!!!!   <br />And, by the way, Don; if you don't like Dallas (where I live and have seen YOU) and the south, LEAVE.  .... you, and the horses you all rode in on!  I used to like you personally.!  Enjoy your extinction.
B000059LGC|5.0|Death on the Nile directed by John Guillermin is a splendid adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel. Ustinov is marvelous in the role as Poirot. We have an absolute all star cast in this amazing movie with fine actors such as David Niven, Peter Ustinov, Mia Farrow and Bette Davis. I love the costumes and the setting and this is indeed a stupendous who dunit story with many twists and turns. The music is ok, but it serves its purpose and on the whole it is one of the better Agataha Christie adaptations that I have seen in quite some time.
B0000AI45P|5.0|This is one of those albums I left in my cd player for weeks after I bought it and recently I rediscovered it and I love it even more. Ever since that I have been on a seemingly hopeless quest to find another album like it. That is to say another piece of art so flawless, yet pleasing to the ear that it makes you want to tell everyone you know and at the same time keep to yourself. This album should be a lot more popular than it is. The combination of Verlaine & Lloyd's guitarwork, the archipeggio riffs and the spraying chords and dischords, along with the fantastically innovative drumming of Ficca and competent bass of Smith are enough to impress any fan of rock, but the songs are simply amazing, all transcending time and genre. This is a once in a lifetime find. Buy it now. Hopefully they will come back to tour the States.
B00078XGRO|5.0|The movie is fine, as always, I enjoyed the extras that were on the second dvd.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|One of the best quotes from one of the best Westerns since \\"Silverado\\" brought the era of the western back to life.  There was such a HUGE backlash against westerns in Hollywood on the big screen and on television after True Grit and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  It seemed like no one could come up with that winning formula that could keep people's attention.   I guess they were over run with westerns since films began.  (The very first film ever made was \\"The Great Train Robbery\\") And if I'm not mistaken Gunsmoke was the last successful western on tv.  No one was willing to finance or greenlight any type of western much less a mini-series.   Then came the Soul music powerhouse  MOTOWN of all companies to take the chance.         This movie is wonderous and sweeping and the dialogue is so colorful and funny that it makes me giggle.  Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones argue and bicker like two old women through their many adventures so much that  it keeps you laughing  and then crying when one by one they loose those close to them while chasing what they KNOW is their last dream together.   Angelica Huston's performance as Clara is tender, hard and heartbreaking, while Diane Lane's performance as Lori is...well just plain heartbreaking.   This ensemble cast is beyond amazing.  Who' da thunk  it?  There are more Oscar winners  and big named actors in this mini series than I've seen in quite some time, all of them acting their collective asses off.   Chris Cooper, Angelica Huston, Tommy Lee Jones,  Robert Duvall, Danny Glover, Steve Buscemi, Diane Lane, Rick Schroeder give heart tugging performances and believe it or not even Robert Urich's acting will tear your heart out as the man who is the unintentional catalyst for the destruction and renewal of so many lives.  The whole story will keep you glued to your tv set.   This set the standard for others to follow as far as (Westerns) mini series go and to date,  I've not seen one yet that can fall into line behindit.  Least of all it's sequel \\"Return to Lonesome Dove\\".
6305907145|4.0|I watched this movie after reading the novel and must confess, I care much more for the movie. The book was [of course] well written, but left me wanting. I struggled through it, being a lover of happy endings, and was little given satisfaction at the end. The movie is not only well done, but the 'artistic liberties' taken by the director are not at all offensive to the novel, but instead offer an enhancement of values to the different characters. It has all of Mansfield Park, and more. If you're a die-hard Jane Austen fan, give it a chance, you may end appreciating it despite differences. I did. :)
0060763280|5.0|I purchased the book for myself and it was sooo good, I purchased two more as gifts.
0743454529|5.0|Not at all what you would expect.  Picoult's intelligence shines through the pages of this novel like a bright ray of light.  The author's commitment is undeniable and immediately visible from the first sentence.  <br /> <br />The story starts when the protagonist, (Anna) decides to make a choice that could rip her family apart.  That's the start of a deadly snow ball affect. And carrying the same analogy, this book is a blizzard.  Filled with drama, questions, and a few revelations, it's hard not to get an emotional attachment to the characters, which we all can relate to.  In this book, there never is a dull moment.  And to say the ending is \\"shocking\\" is like comparing a boulder to a pebble, a HUGE understatement.
0380733358|3.0|As an aspiring writer, I can't see the fuss over this book--not as a bestseller. My only conclusion as to why it's so popular is that it was published long ago: great for its time. And yet, new readers continue to praise this book, which makes me think that anything will sell and entertain the masses. <br /> <br />To begin with, the novel begins with a slow, over--descriptive narrative that SHOULD have lost most readers. Worse, Follet attempts to start a subplot--2 new characters getting married--ontop the heap of 2 military personnel, Die Nadel (Faber), and a boarding house full of tenants. Follet could've easily solved this problem by beginning with Faber and the landlord, grabbing the reader by the throat (via the murder), and then introducing MI6.  <br /> <br />Now, there is no doubt that Follet can write; he has great chops, particularly in writing action scenes. Even the romantic subplot of Lucy and David is gripping. Yet what was most annoying was his constant alternate chapters where the \\"authorities\\" are one step behind Faber. Follet seemed to forget that he was righting from a 3rd person/omniscient point of view--that is, where he tells us what everyone is doing and thinking. Via this method, the reader clearly knows every step Faber makes. So why in God's name did Follet decide to bore the reader with redundant, useless scenes of bemused police and MI6? Every time Faber steals a car, hops a train, breaks and enters, or kills someone, the reader then has to leave that thrilling pace and action to read the next chapter: 2 cops talking about how Faber stole a car, hopped a train... WE KNOW THAT ALREADY! <br /> <br />At one point, Faber ditches a stolen car and instead of Follet just writing \\"The car was found...\\" or \\"Hey, sarge, we found his trail...\\", we must endure another of Follet's unbridled creations: some handicapped kid (full with aggravating backstory) who stumbles upon the car... WHO CARES? Why invent a whole new character which serves no purpose except to say \\"He found the car\\"?  <br /> <br />Now, why readers stuck through this all was certainly due to Faber's \\"James Bond\\" personality. He's a cool, clever killer and, again, the action scenes are good. Of course, no reader should've been truly surprised at the conclusion of the story, or that Follet would go over the top. Way over. Suddenly the proper young Lucy turns into a fast-thinking, all-knowing heroin who can rig car bombs, send wireless radio signals, shoot guns, and fend of Faber (where tons of experienced soldiers and spies have failed). Yeah, right.  <br />  <br />This book is so similar to a B-movie, I'm simply amazed at the praise it has received. Follet's characters and scenes are exaggerated and molded to fit the story: if it demands a hero, special power, rabbit from thin air, Follet is willing to pull it out to make the pieces fit. Say what you want about Stephen King, at least he understands the limits of fiction and TRIES to make it credible, or at least plausible.  <br /> <br />Well, I suppose it shouldn't sadden or irritate me that readers actually gobbled up this book...just think of all the masses now waiting to read my ludicrous, trashy bestseller.
B0000029AL|5.0|Aerosmith's self-titled album is a great start in their or any rock band's career. It features the classic hits Dream On and Mama Kin as well as smaller gems like Make It. Overall though not A-Smith's best a great album with great music. (Well most of it.):-). If Aerosmith hadn't made this one heaven knows where they'd be right now. (Doing Rags Music at Clinics.)  <br /> <br />Make It was a great start to the album. It had all the A-Smith instrumentals and vocals you love but was lacking in some ways. Still a great #??? start up. I give Make It 4 stars. <br /> <br />Somebody was good too but not as good as Make It (Or Mama Kin and Dream On.) Another song with good guitar but not as good. Still worth 4 stars. <br /> <br />Dream On is one of the best Aerosmith songs ever. Possibly the best ever. A great vocal and percussion performance. A nice mid-song guitar solo. And the bass (If you can hear it.) Is good. Awesome Aerosmith song. 5+ stars. #1 on the album. <br /> <br />One Way Street is great!! I don't see what some people have against it! A great kind of darker, blues song. One of the most underrated gems in Aerosmith's history! Great song! 4 1/2 stars. All the music is in tune. <br /> <br />Mama Kin. We've had 4 awesome songs in a row so far. Mama Kin makes it 5 songs. This has a great guitar solo introduction. (The best of Joe and Brad.) And then Steven comes and does his thing. This is one of my all-time favorite A-Smith songs of the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 0s. 5 stars. <br /> <br />Write Me a Letter is kind of a disappointer. Good guitar in some places. And Steven did okay, but still it was bad. 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br />Movin Out was good. Above Average guitar and bass. (Vocals and Drums too.) Other than that there's not much to say about it. A good above average song. 4 stars. <br /> <br />Walkin' the Dog is the worst on the album! Come on! It has terrible everything. Shame on Aerosmith for releasing this song. Come on Aerosmith! A bad song! Avoid it at all costs!! <br /> <br />Overall though their self-titled album was great, fantastic! (And bad boy words too.):-( That I can't say. A great album though!!!!!!! Best start I've ever seen! Worth the money x4!!!!!!!!!! This one was great!! :-) :-) :-)
B0007TKNL0|5.0|If you are thinking of purchasing this DVD you are in for a spectacular treat! I still cannot fathom why this magnificent rendition of \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" was judged so harshly by the critics.  <br /> <br />I know many have been comparing Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler to Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford. Even if you are familiar with the original cast recording, please give this movie and soundtrack a chance. It is true that the interpretations and voice quality are somewhat different. But I believe that many things are improved in this version.  <br /> <br />Emmy Rossum's voice brought such youth and innocence to the character of Christine. She is more pleasing to listen to, in my opinion, than Sarah Brightman as her sound is very pure and unobscured by a heavy vibrato.  <br /> <br />Gerard Butler has, unfortunately, been under much criticism for his performance as the Phantom. Personally, I think his interpration is much more appropriate. It is true that Michael Crawford has an incredibly trained voice and sings flawlessly. However, I have always imagined the Phantom to have a darker more mysterious edge to his voice. This is exactly what Gerard brings to the character of the Phantom. His passion and emotion can be heard behind each syllable. Music is also my passion, and though many musicians have attacked his singing ability, I commend him, and the others as well for their contribution to the world of music in making this film. Gerard's acting is genious as well. His character draws you to a degree not accomplished by many actors. Bravo!  <br /> <br />I also highly reccommend the extended edition soundtrack as well. I am listening to it even I as I type this review. Both the movie and soundtrack would earn 10 stars from me if I could give them.  <br /> <br />Each time I view this masterpiece I am brought to tears. The music and acting evokes emotions from me like no other film has. I trust the characters will win your heart as they have won mine.  <br/> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00008G9JO|4.0|I hadn't heard Heavy Horses in 25 years and I remembered it as being a not-particularly-strong album, the beginning of Tull's decline to the depths of the mid-80's.  Then I listened again.    I think it's great the reissue includes \\"Broadford Bazaar.\\" No, it doesn't fit in with the farm-animal concept, but hey, it's a good song, as opposed to drivel like \\"Weathercock.\\" The other songs are keepers, though. The title song could have had 4 minutes surgically removed, but remember this was the 70's when time could be artificially extended or compacted at will. \\"Mouse Police\\" was the most fun Ian had had since Thick As A Brick. \\"Moths\\" still touches me, and \\"Acres Wild\\" out-sylvans Songs From the Wood.
B000002BSG|5.0|i never thought i would like this kind of music until recently i bought their latest album dynamite and i decided to bought travelling without moving few days later<br /><br />its hard to expain how do i like this album since i'm a metal fan<br /><br />i was megadeth fan  altough i do listen to very various type of music. And if you want a band that can play various kinds of music then jamiroquai has it all.<br /><br />just buy it and you wont be disapointed, i can enjoy this album in any mood. I gave it 9/10
B0001WTVUW|4.0|I originally saw this when it was first aired in 1983 (I was about four or five then) and my parents tell me that I was disturbed by the concept of nuclear war and from then on was against nuclear proliferation.  I just know I've had a terror of all things nuke from the moment I first viewed this film on.  Recently though, I had the good fortune of catching this on TVLand and I am very glad I did. <br /> <br />I live and work in Kansas City.  I go to school in Lawrence.  This is my hometown and despite the background knowledge of all of the \\"targets\\" so densely packed in this general geographic vacinity (as well as some other things that would make KC a lovely bullseye,) it never really hit home to me that this would even be considered a target...or how devastating it could be. <br /> <br />Realistic, disturbing, and an excellent cautionary tale, this film has not lost any of its sobering qualities in the twenty-two years since it was made.  While the \\"heartland\\" of America has certainly changed (KC is bigger, Harrisonville much less rural, etc.) the general human impact has not.  I encourage everyone to watch this film, get informed, and remember that there really is no \\"middle of nowhere\\" anymore. <br /> <br />Oh yes, and John Lithgow was horribly under-used in this.
B000819PKC|5.0|This album proof that Jay Kay is still making a quality stuff. For those who 's not familiar with jamiroquai this album appearently is a good way to start. However this album is closer to \\"travelling without moving\\"<br />then the debut album and \\"space cowboy\\"<br /><br />Starchild, loveblind, seven days in sunny june , Talulah, black devil car, electric misstress,etc i found this album can be enjoyed from start to finish.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I've never been blown away by a band like I've been blown away by the Mars Volta.  They are truly talented musicians, and their sound is beyond words.  In fact, it is almost impossible to describe the Mars Volta to someone who is unfamiliar with their work.  Comparisons tend to simplify and mislead.  I think it's fair to say that they can be loud and dark, but unlike so many contemporary bands (including bands as talented as NIN), the Mars Volta are not loud and dark for the sake of being loud and dark; their sound does not come across as affected in any way, nor do their lyrics (thank god Bixter-Zavala is not introspective and self-loathing - his lyrics, which may have been based on a found diary, are nightmarish in the way a Goya print is nightmarish).  Besides, the Mars Volta's musical style is not merely kick-ass rock; it is a fusion of sounds as disparate as jazz, Latin, and post-modern punk.  Unexpected instrumental solos are lurking around every corner, from Rodriguez-Lopez's phenomenal guitar riffs, to an avant-garde piano tangent reminiscent of the one from David Bowie's \\"Aladdin Sane.\\"  This internal eclecticism helps distinguish the Mars Volta from so many other commercially-driven bands that limit their sound to fit a hackneyed genre.  Another distinguishing characteristic of the Mars Volta is that they do not create an album full of discrete, radio-friendly songs.  Although it is broken up by quasi-titles and tracks, \\"Frances the Mute\\" really only exists in its entirety; it is a multifarious yet indivisible work of art, a seamless, 87-minute trip.   <br /> <br />The album begins with innocuous enough guitar strumming and Bixter-Zavala's gentle musings, but almost immediately erupts with in-your-face intensity.  This is one of the things I love about \\"Frances the Mute;\\" it continuously evolves and explodes.  And, whereas some bands that have employed this technique (think Tool) have become predictable in their \\"explosions,\\" the Mars Volta always catchesyou off-guard.  Their manic, screeching bursts deconstruct into extended periods of wordless experimentation and repetitive, barely-musical sound.  Some may find this annoying or pretentious, but these segues are actually strokes of genius.  They work on so many levels.  Clearly, the peculiar and haunting noises create a sense of dark ambience.  I would advise, though, that their function is also similar to that of the slivers of ginger one finds on a large sushi platter.  They break up the frenzy and give the listener a chance to reconvene - to clear the pallette.  The segues also provide a false sense of comfort.  Despite your anticipation, you never know when the Mars Volta will throw you right back into the fire.  <br /> <br />Bixter-Zavala's voice reflects the erratic roller coaster of sound created by his band.  His vocals (sung partly in English and partly in Spanish) range from an insistent whisper; to a lounge-singer-like croon; to raw, passionate wailing.  I am inclined to compare him to Robert Plant (as others have), yet Bixter-Zavala's voice is far more pure, emotional, agitated and (believe it or not) sexy. <br /> <br />Some of you are going to buy this CD and be blown away; some of you are going to buy this CD and be intrigued but put off.  Either way - please - see the Mars Volta in concert.  For those of you who are not instantly into them, it will put all of the pieces together.  And I promise, it will be one of the best shows (probably the best show) you have ever seen.  <br />
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I have loved this film ever since I'd first watched it when I was 7. Ironically, having grown up with this version of Oz instead of the Judy Garland version, I was rather disturbed by the fact that this land of Oz was once pretty much a merry, not to mention colorful, wonderland. But when I heard of the actual book I figured the 1939 musical was simply 'inspired by' it, rather than based upon the book itself. I mean, there has to be some form of fear and darkness in a land completely different from home right?  Although I haven't read the book, I have heard that both versions are not entirely based upon it. I assume that the original Wizard of Oz took the brighter aspect of the land of Oz while Return to Oz took the creepiness and fear to another level.    This film starts from the point when we have a surprisingly young Dorothy raving about a brilliant world called Oz, and  Aunt Em decides that Dorothy needs psychological therapy. Already kind of odd, no? This sets the tone for most of the film: bleak, creepy, and kinda scary. Although not an outright horror film, it's pretty scary for a Disney movie. Once Dorothy has returned to Oz, it is a completely different matter. Her friends have all turned into stone, there are hideous creatures called The Wheelers, and a headless princess. That scene with the princess chasing Dorothy was one of the scariest (and best) things I'd seen as a kid. Which is precisely what made me want to watch it again.   This is a film that shouldn't be missed. Since I have never read the books before, I cannot comment on the accuracy of the adaptation, but I still love the film for what it is.
B00006J3T4|3.0|Ad stated \\"like new\\" - well, the disc was clearly used and had small scratches.  It still played fine, so not a big deal, but I felt the ad was misleading.
B00005RHGK|3.0|I personally believe the Horror movie industry began a slow decline in the mid 1980's. It seemed like every possibility had been used up and audiences could not longer be spooked with gory special effects or imaginative use of the cinema camera. Auteurs like Dario Argento, Mario Bava, George Romero and even hacks like Lucio Fulci began to get progressively worse as the 1980's wore on. At this time, American horror movies began the development of \\"character\\" driven horror movies (since the good guys where all victims, only the baddies could get character development) and this led to serial series including horror stalwarts such as Freddie Krueger, Michael Myers, Jason Voohees as well as lesser knowns like the Tall Man (Phantasm). These serial horror movies (Jason X, Freddie VII, Halloween H20, Puppet Master 15) led to the downfall, because while the series runs out of ideas after the second movie, the movies are continued to be made.  <br /> <br />The 1990's brought some interesting ideas. I liked movies like People Under the Stairs (1991), Scream (1996) and others, but the genre has not recovered. In the early 1980's, Jeepers Creepers would not be considered much of an atmospheric movie (compared to movies like \\"The Fog\\" or \\"The keep\\"), but in a genre in which movies like Jason X and The Haunting exist, Jeeper's Creepers does pretty well.  <br /> <br />The movie starts with a brother and sister pair going home for Spring Break. Darry (short for Darius) is the younger brother, who is a goof and easy going. Trish is the older, more cynical sister. As they drive, they play silly road games (like we all used to during long road trips) and pick on each other, however, there is always an air of tension in the air that lingers even in the most lightest moments. It is helped by the fact that the soundtrack is very much in the background, not manipulating the audience.  <br /> <br />Terror does appear in the form of an old battered truck that terrorizes the teens. It is an homage to Duel, one of my favorite movies of the 1970's. However, soon we find out the identity of the driver as the kids pass by and see him dropping body bags into a sewer. In a scene that defies all logic, but falls under the \\"rules\\" that govern horror movies, the two go back and investigate what is happening. What they find is horrifying, but not too original (Salva and his production designer must have seen one Coffin Joe movie too much).  <br /> <br />The being catches their scent and begins tracking them down and the movies turns into a cat and mouse game, with the protagonists frantically running and the antagonist turning into the indistructible shape. While the movie begins to term generic and the baddies turns into another Freddie like character, the ending was great and does provide a slight twist.  <br /> <br />Victor Salva, who was notorious as being the \\"child molester\\" director has directed two movies that I have seen. Clownhouse is a low budget movie that was fairly well done, but his first big budget movie \\"Powder\\" was simply horrible. With Jeepers Creepers he starts out well, but as the story develops, the audience learns too much of the creature and it begins to lose it's mystique (One of the reason why the movie Duel was so great was because we never understand the motives of the crazy trucker). At the end we find out he's just another movie monster, another demon that has no appeal because the only thing that makes it interesting is taken away from it.  <br /> <br />The brother and sister duo do better. They are believable as siblings and do what they can with the simplistic script. However, they are not given a chance to progress their relationship past the setup phase so when one of the siblings are taken away from the other, we don't feel the great sense of loss that we should.  <br /> <br />Overall, this movie is good in a genre that has consistently given us crap over the past 15 years. But, this movie is in no way going to be a classic.....Rating: C+  <br /> <br />The DVD has several featuers, but it is not full of them. The minimalistic soundtrack gets creepy at the right momemts and has decent (but not great) dynamic punch. The transfer is average...DVD features rating is C. <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|No album ever had such a grandiose impact on music culture and the industry as Nevermind did. Following the release, sales exploded for this album, and also enabled upcoming alternative bands to finally get their moment of fame. I wanted to avoid the Guns n Roses Nirvana feud, so I'll just state that Cobain was a selfish, ignorant human being responsible for some of the bashing put towards an incredible metal band that highly influenced Nirvana in many ways. That being said, he knew how to pen an incredible rock song, produce inducing guitar hooks, which were catchy beyond imagination, and highly contribute to the release of one of the greatest rock albums of all time.<br /><br />Opening with a song that in many ways defined rock for the 90s, Smells Like Teen Spirit is viciously punk infused rocker, with a guitar riff that's catchy as hell. However, I myself am more fond of the powerful follow up In Bloom, with its downkey guitar smashing and explosive drums creating a delicious rocker(my favourite). Come As You Are opens as a dark, disturbing tune, breaking into another classic rocker which ultimately earned a great deal of airplay and still does. Breed is simpler, very fast paced and punk influenced. Lithium was arguably the second biggest hit on the album, with the awesome chorus, and captivating guitar melody through the verses of the song. Polly is a darker side of Nirvana, in a sense showing Cobain exploring with a more delicate tune with great effectiveness. Territorial Pissing is a dangerous rocker, with speedy drums from Grohl and an awesome lyrical delivery. Drain You stays with the consistency of the rest of the album, another solid rocker. Lounge Act lacks some of the rock righteousness that was perfectly executed in the tracks prior to it. Nevertheless, it isn't worthy of a skip. Stay Away certainly provides more energy, opening similarly to Territorial Pissings with the drums, and building into just another great rock song, which is basically in summary the truth to this album. Ending with the most depressing song on the tracklisting, Something In The Way, we hear a most disturbing lyrical delivery, with a gripping chorus.<br /><br />Overall rock n' roll fans cannot pass up this album, easily a landmark album in rock history which still resonates through music today. Sadly it was taken the wrong way, and music culture was ultimately destroyed by disgusting interpretations. Highly Recommended to all.mary the truth to this album.

B00005JLT5|3.0|Wladyslaw Szpilman is no hero. He is not like Oskar Schindler who lost everything to save thousands of people. Szpilman didn't join the Polish resistance to fight the German invaders. In fact, he didn't save one life or kill one German throughout the war.  <br /> <br />He just survived.  <br /> <br />Szpilman was a celebrated pianist in post German-occupied Poland. He was developing a career when the German's captured Poland and began oppressing the rights of the Jews. We see their personal freedoms decay over a period of months and at the end, they are all sent to the infamous \\"Warsaw Ghetto\\" where 360,000 Jews were herded into a space that could barely fit one tenth that number. Szpilman is more of an observer in the movie and he witnesses things from a distance. A boy being beaten to near death when trying to return to the Ghetto from a hole in the wall, people being lined up and shot randomly, people forced to dance for the soldiers, a man printing up newsletters demanding rights for the Jewish people of the Ghetto. However, he never gets involved in any of these events. When the Jews are finally sent to the death camps, Szpilman is rescued by a Jewish policemen (who were the lackeys of the Nazis) and he is given places to hide. He hides for nearly 3 years and then meets a German officer who is mesmerized by his Piano playing skills and offers him protection, where he stays until his town is saved by the Russians.  <br /> <br />Roman Polanski, who took aspects of his life as well as documentary footage to make a film that encapulates Warsaw in the 1940's. The buildings, costumes and the feelings are there. He does even better showing a destroyed Warsaw, where the city lies in ruins and the people are in hiding. You get the sense of the devastation that the city went through.  <br /> <br />However, I felt his directing was uneven. I enjoyed the movie much better when Szpilman was one his own. The earlier scenes when Szpilman is with his parents seem forced and idealized. His father is the pillar of integrity, his brother the figure of defiance and the women are not fleshed out well, including his sisters whom we barely get to know. However, the macro aspects of the first half of the movie bothered me more.  <br /> <br />What Polanski seemed to be doing was to show us what the horrors that the Jews went through at that time, but the scenes seem all staged, as if Polanski got on his soapbox and visually screams \\"This is what the Germans did to us!\\" Polanski got his inspiration from documentary clips (as seen in the DVD), but he takes these random episodes of violence and inhumanity and strings them together at one shot. To me, the staginess of these scenes seems a bit pretentious because there is nothing behind the violence, it just there to portray the Nazi's in an (justifiably) evil light. However, in movies like Schindler's List, the violence was always justified because Spielberg took time out to study the mindset of the Nazis, especially Amon Goeth.  <br /> <br />The movie works better when Szpilman is on his own. Without a network of friends and admirers, Szpilman would have never survived and the movie makes this very clear. Adrien Brody does an amazing job of changing the once confident pianist to a quivering, fearful bum. He shows Szpilman as an observer, someone who is too scared to make a commitment to anything other than his own survival. However, this is not a bad thing, just a realism of what 99.5% of the population would do if they were caught in Wladyslaw's situation. It is a tragedy what happens to such a talent and you see his passion for the piano in the soulful face of Brody, who captures his essense so well.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie, but I would not place it in the top movies 5 that deal with the holocaust. It's no Schindler's list, but it's no \\"Life is Beautiful\\" either (thank god). <br />
B000002L5I|5.0|This is a type of CD that you can just lean back and listen to.  There is a little of evreything.  Kenny has one of the best feels for playing \\"alive\\" music in stead of cookie cutter music.  It is very hard to find radio stations that play this music and it is nice to have in a library to pull and enjoy.
B00005JM0B|3.0|The hype of this movie has been pretty low key. Arnold has gone out and done some interviews (actually, I think he's using this movie to sell his bid for the Governor job in California), but little else has been said.  <br /> <br />It is ten years later and the expected holocaust that Sarah Conner had nightmares of never happened. However, John cannot seem to let it go and is leading a hobo life in anticipation that Skynet will one day become aware. It becomes reality as a new terminator is sent back to destroy John Connor and his future lieutenant in order to rewrite history while the rebellion sends back their own terminator to protect him. This time, not only is John's life on the line, but also the lives of the world as the new Terminatrix prepares for the arrival of her master, the Skynet AI. It will be up to John and the old T101 (and his future wife Kate Brewster) to prevent that from happening.  <br /> <br />This movie is a hack in many regards and the source it steals from most is T2: Judgment Day. From the fact that there are two Terminators in a showdown to the fact that Arnold has to have the Ray-ban glasses, much of this movie can be seen in the previous movie. However, this time, Arnold is less the nurturing machine to the man-child John and more the sarcastic killing sidekick. Only Arnold has the one liners in this movie and he does say them with the relish he can get away with under his emotionless exterior. Another movie this borrows from is from the Matrix (even though the series came out 13 years earlier) but more in fact, the Animatrix. Of course, you can also say that the movie also stole from the Forbin project back in the 1970's. It sees a time, where there is no AI mainframe, where the computers will attack from the world wide web, which is different from the movies which also tried to characterize a supercomputer (HAL 9000) adversary as a physical box which could be overcome. The way that T3 falls is more like tha Anime movies like Ghost inthe Shell where AI consciousness is gained in a global web.  <br /> <br />Going back to Animatrix, T3 follows the stories in that short stories DVD that reflect the human history and their war with the AI. It is similar (As with the Forbin Project) that human's are deemed as a threat to their existence and need to be wiped out. This movie portrays this fairly well.  <br /> <br />Another movie series this rips from is the \\"Planet of the Apes\\" series. Like those four movies which do a full circle and come around, the Terminator movies also do the same, and that's why I really liked the depressing ending. Some people think that the ending opens up for a fourth Terminator movie where it would end with Reese (Michael Biehn) going back in time to save the original Sarah. I guess the take of T3 will decide that.  <br /> <br />The acting is done well in most regards. Claire Danes, who plays the spunky Kate is almost unrecognizable (she always plays this weepy girly girl character) and is pretty good with the material she's given. Arnold seems to have this role down pat and is on cruise control. It is remarkable that in 20 years, his body has not changed much. Nick Stahl does a great job playing John Connor, but he does not look like the hero, resemble or carry himself like the John Connor first Terminator movie. For some reason that did bother me. However, even though he will always be ADD boy from \\"Man without a Face\\" he gets the aimless man with a mission thing down good and comes off much better than the whiny kid that was portrayed by Edward Furlong in T2. Kristanna Loken does a fantastic job as the TX, much better than the T1000 played by Robert Patrick in the second movie. All she is required to do is run, fight and look unemotional and she pulls it off well. Of course, this doesn't mean that she can act, but for this role, she knew what it requred.  <br /> <br />The main fault of this movie is not that is more of a classic big-budget movie, but it is an old style movie that has no flair or panache. Maybe I'm still being wowed by effect heavy or \\"slow mo in every frame\\" fare like charlie's Angels or the Matrix where every action frame has to stand out on their own, or epics like the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" where the computer devises thousands of enemies to fight the heroes, but this movie seems to be a little small. Take the scene where John is being followed by the TX and 4 cars she is controlling. 5 years ago, that would have been an amazing scene with ET and Extra doing round the clock interview on how they could destroy a building with an industrial crane, nowadays, it's like: \\"What, they didn't use a computer?\\" However, Mostow films it a little to matter of factly, no overhead shots, no wide angle shots. It's actually fairly choppy, like the whole chase scene (which actually looked better planned out than the Matrix car chase). Everything in this movie has a low budget feel to it and it is because this movie is relic of action movies past.  <br /> <br />However, saying that, as an older movie watcher, I did like the action scenes and I felt the movie did go at a quick enough pace. I feel that the movie didn't really with the issue of \\"Should John risk it and go and fight to save the present? Or Hide and know he will save the future?\\" That could have been an interesting premise. Anyway, compared to the Matrix Reloaded and Charlies Angels, this one is the best of the bunch and will provide a good time that exists slightly above the those who like their movies brain DOA....Rating: B-  <br /> <br />PS: In all these movies, how come the good guy doesn't come like several days ahead and take care of the situation?  <br />
B00004Z459|5.0|Okay, I personally think that Linkin Park is the best band ever. They have the most unique sound that you will ever hear. I mean face it, how many bands are noticed who basically have their own separate type of music.  To all you people who think that they suck because of there being a rapper in a metal band, you've never really listened to them.  Not many bands can pull off what they've done.  They're a mix of several types of music, consisting of: heavy metal, alt. metal, rock, hip hop, rap, soft rock, nu-metal and a couple other types.  A lot of people think that it's insanely stupid that a metal band had a concert with one of the most talented and famous rappers of all time.  Seeing as how they are the first to do that, many people neglect the whole idea.  Chester (the lead singer) has the most amazing voice, one minute he's singing and the next he's screaming as hard as he can and still pull it off. Mike (the rapper and back up vocalist) is an incredible rapper; he doesn't get the credit he deserves.  Most people just assume that just because he's white that it's just some controversial issue, well it's not.  Mr. Hahn (the dj) isn't making some random scratching noise, it's the way that it's supposed to sound, and he brings the music together.  Linkin Park has such an original sound that will never fade.  If they really sucked that bad, then why did their debut album go 8 times platinum?  Most people just hate them because they're ignorant.  They listen to the cd and are overwhelmed by their unique sound because it's something they never heard before.  And you can't say that their reanimation album was just some remix they made of the songs on their previous album.  Some of those songs were the songs that they wrote and sang before they even got a record deal and before their debut album came out.  I personally think that it was an original way to get people to hear the music that most of their fans never got to hear.  And they didn't just put the Reanimation cd out to get more money. Seriously, if their previous album went 8 times platinum, then why would they immediately need to come out with another cd for more money?  Linkin Park's lyrics are some of the most creative I've ever heard. How many other bands have you heard that have lyrics that are actually written by the band that have real meaning to them, other than just saying f**** you all the time.  It's great to finally hear a band that doesn't have every other worse being a curse word.  And I think it's an amazing accomplishment to be where they are today.  Having millions of fans and being able to go on tour with different genres other than their own.  And it's just nice to relax and not listen to heavy metal that swear and talk s*** about other people constantly.  Some of the guys really did have a messed up child hood.  Especially Chester, going through abuse doesn't turn you into a Brittany Spears. It's no wonder why he is the way that he is. Don't get me wrong, I still think that KoRn, slipknot, metallica, rob zombie, and american head charge are amazing bands.  But, there's just something that's separating Linkin Park from everyone else. And, they really havn't mainstreamed.  Look at From The Inside, and Faint, they're just as heavy as some of the songs on Hybrid Theory.  I just wish that people could just appreciate their music for what it really is and means.  They write their own music and lyrics, play their own instruments, and don't use tapes on stage and lipsync like 3/4 of artits out there.  They deserve to get a break from everyone constantly giving them s***. Linkin Park is just another band doing their own thing and having fun with it, which is why I love them so much. The best thing about them is they don't listen to the critics and mainstream, or change their sound.  Linkin Park is formed by 6 awesome guys, who aren't posers, and really connect with the fans instead of treating them like dirt(like the heavy metal bands like slipknot, coal chamber, in flames, slayer, etc..). <br />They really are the best band out there.
B0000541AM|4.0|One may think that this is the standard and typical gang potboiler, but in fact it is somewhat more intelligent than that.  <br /> <br />The major story line involves a summit involving the top 200 or so gangs. Led by the Grammercy Riffs, the big goal is to unite the gangs to overrun NYC.  <br /> <br />The major problem is that their leader, Cyrus is whacked by one of his rivals, The Rogues, but the blame is placed squarely on the Warriors. Now, the Warriors have to fight their way home to Coney Island, far far away from their meeting place in the Bronx.  <br /> <br />The Warriors falls under the John Carpenter 1970's school of film making. It is atmospheric and provides a shallow level social commentary on the decay of morality and law (Coming from the Jimmy Carter era of politics) that eventually led to the conservatism of movies in the 1980s with movies like Dirty Harry and Death Wish. The music, from Tangerine Dream is both atmospheric and evokes a sense of hopelessness which suits the movie and explains the mission of our gang very well.  <br /> <br />The main characters also do a great job with their cartoon characters. Michael Beck is wonderfully understated as Swan, the new war chief. He is well complemented by James Remar who plays Ajax, the unpredictable and emotional second in charge. There is also Mercy, who is played by Deborah Van Valkenburgh. She is the spunky romantic type lead who is emotional damaged goods and seeks men for sex to forget about her miserable life.  <br /> <br />On the bad side is Luther, played by David Patrick Kelly. reminiscent of Joacquim Phoenix's Emperor Commodus with his slightly pshchotic, slightly uncontrollable personality. He also mutters the best line in the movie (see title) while clanking some bottles.  <br /> <br />While this movie seems very simplistic, I feel that it does have some resemblance of some Greek mythology. It is reminiscent of Anabasis, the story of 10K Greek mercenaries sent off to fight in Persia but then must find their way home when their boss dies. In the Greek story, the bosses name is Cyrus, also the name of the Riffs leader who is killed in the beginning of the movie. The Warriors is also reminiscent of the Odyessy, which also includes the seduction of the Warriors by the Sirens, who are represented by a lesbian gang called the Lizzies. A third reference is the character of Ajax, which was a warrior that fought in the Trojan war. He was a brave but impetuous warrior that raped Princess Cassandra and was eventually punished by the gods. In the movie, Ajax is a fighter that does not think things through and he is ultimately brought down when he tries to rape a woman in a Park.  <br /> <br />The movie also has hints of the \\"Clockwork Orange\\" in it's portrayal of cartoon like gangs. The gang culture is similar to more like superhero cartoons, rather than gritty street life. There are gangs that involve multicultured skinheads (the Turnbull AC's), hicks in overalls on rollerskates (gang name unknown), baseball players (The furies) and bunch of kids who look like leftover trash (The Orphans), African Americans in silk pajamas/karate outfits (The Riffs). These colorful gangsters with even more colorful names are reminiscient of The Droogs much more than say, the Bloods or the Crips. However, while outdated, it is still very fun to watch in a way....Rating: B <br />
1401300901|2.0|I wouldn't say it was a horrible book but it def. took me awhile to get through it.  I really had to force myself to read just because i wanted to finish it.  The dialogue seems very childlike.  There are parts when the characters begin to crack up when nothing funny happened. I can def. see it being turned into a motion picture as it says it will be on the back of the book.  Maybe if it was much shorter it would have been better.
B00009W0U4|4.0|The movie takes it's trick from Memento, a good movie that used it's reverse timeline as more visual trickery than as an integrated plotline.  <br /> <br />Here, Gaspar Noe does a better job and the movie Irrevisible would not work nearly as well if it moved linearly in time.  <br /> <br />The movie starts off with two men being arrested in a gay sex bar and they are accused of some unnamed horrendous crime (the bystanders are yelling at them). As the movie moves backwards, we see what that crime is and what motivated them to commit such a horrendous act. The main character is Marcus, a philandering alpha male that seems to react on forces that are thrown at him. He is unpredictable, reckless and works on emotion exclusively. His counterpart is Pierre, who is rational, more philosophical and tends to think things through. That makes him more boring and neurotic as well (A la Woody Allen), but they feed off each other well as the bloody crescendo reaches it's climax as they search for a rapist named La Tenia, who raped Alex (female) who is Marcus' lover and Pierre's ex girlfriend.  <br /> <br />As the movie starts off, the camera angles are wild and unpredictable and could get nauseating at times. As the movie progresses (or regresses), it becomes more stable because the scenes becomes less violent, less gratuitous, more innocent. It's a good tool that is used because it makes Noe's statement of time destroying all things more relevant. This is same for the music, where in the beginning it is violent, electronic, wild and then ends up being soothing, classical.  <br /> <br />The actors do a good job at their roles, especially Monica Bellucci who plays Alex. She has a central role, which involves a 10 minute rape scene. IT is hard to watch and must have been horrendous to film, since there is no editing involved. HOwever, the cast is not given much to work with and they are given just a few emotions to deal with (pierre is rational and idological, Marcus is dominant and irrational and Alex is the passive gf). Marcus and Alex do have good chemistry (Bellucci and Cassel are a real life couple) which makes what is to happen all that much more painful to watch.  <br /> <br />I believe Gaspar Noe (this is the first movie of his I've seen) has great potential, as did Bryan Singer, John Woo, David Fincher before moving on bigger, but not always better things and I hope his next movie is as good as Irreverisible.  <br /> <br />The DVD has an excellent transfer and has amazing sound. The extras are lacking though, other than a couple of trailers, a short film (boring) and two vignettes that seem like they were afterthoughts because of the lack of a \\"making off\\".  <br /> <br />I did like how they explain the beating to death scene in the SFX section. It was the most realistic I have ever seen on film. <br />
038551123X|3.0|Jeff Lindsay, Darkly Dreaming Dexter (Doubleday, 2004)<br /><br />The thing I keep hearing about this novel, over and over again, is how original it is. Okay, folks, listen up, 'cause I'll only say this once-- the serial killer who only kills bad people is not a new concept. (Anyone remember The Toxic Avenger?) For that matter, it's come into something of a renaissance recently, so much so that the series premiere of the new TV show The Inside dealt with it. If scriptwriters for a TV show are onto something, guys, it's old news.<br /><br />That said, Darkly Dreaming Dexter is still quite the fun read. The pages turn quickly, and Dexter truly is a likable sort of guy, though he continues the recent trend in my reading of narrators so unreliable you have to wonder about the sanity of their creators. Dexter constantly refers to himself as a sociopath, unhuman. The first may be true, but much of Dexter's development throughout the book is not a struggle to become (or against becoming) human as much as it is a struggle with himself to keep from recognizing his own humanity. Dexter, while a far more likable protagonist, shares a lot of traits with Larry, the disaffected (to put it mildly) youth in Dennis Cooper's recent novel My Loose Thread.<br /><br />While the plot of Darkly Dreaming Dexter definitely plays second fiddle to us getting to know Dexter (this is the first book in a projected series), there is, in fact, a plot, and it's a pretty good one; Dexter, who when he's not out killing bad folks is a blood-splatter analyst for the Miami police, gets drawn into an investigation of a serial killer who's not taunting the police in general, but is definitely trying to send some sort of message to Dexter in particular. The problem is that Dexter can't figure out whether the killer's trying to say \\"I'm coming after you\\" or \\"Hi! Want to play?\\"<br /><br />Darkly Dreaming Dexter is your basic beach read-- empty calories. It's a good book, but not one that's destined to stick with you for a long time after you close the cover. (I finished it five days ago, and just now, while thinking about it, had trouble remembering the identity of the killer.) Still, it's fast-paced, funny, elegant in its own way, and left me wanting to read the next book.o stick with you for a long time after you close the cover.

B0001XAPZ6|4.0|The box on the DVD says that this is Miyazaki's masterpiece. While this movie was a huge influence on my life with movies, I don't really think that this movie would be the crowning jewel on his celebrated career.  <br /> <br />I have seen the movie \\"Warriors of the Wind\\" which was the first release of Nausicaa in North America. It was so cut up according to Miyazaki that he refused to put his name on it and refused to release more movies unless he had total control. In the 1990's he then relented, releasing Totoro through Fox Pictures and then made his deal with Disney to re-release his other movies either through a theatrical release or video. Nausicaa, his second feature, comes direct to video.  <br /> <br />The movie takes place a thousand years after the seven days of fire that destroyed the modern world. The land was scorched and eventually replaced with a toxic jungle poisonous to mankind. The creatures of the seven days of fire represent the nuclear capabilities of man and the toxic jungle represents the response of the nature to protect them from Man. There are some disparate kingdoms and one of them is the Valley of the Wind. They are blessed with the wind from the sea, which keeps the deadly spores of the jungle away and the people have developed a symbiotic relationship (some would even say a love of) the jungle. The daughter of the king, Nausicaa is one of those people. She often travels into the jungle, trying to find a way to live in harmony with the jungle, while others find ways to destroy it. One day, she meets Lord Yupa, a traveling warrior/philosopher unlike Gandalf in the LoTR, who is a friend of the King, who has taken ill. Right after his arrival, an airship from the Kingdom of Tolmekia, a war like nation who conquers others in the name of unity and protecting them under their umbrella for the good of humankind (ahem, that sounds familiar). They are on their home from a recent conquest of the Kingdom of Pejite (which is represented as a vaguely Arabic nation) after finding out that the Pejite recently discovered a demon responsible for the seven days of fire. The ship, of course and infested with creatures of the jungle, crash lands and they discover the demon (in a hibernating state). Soon, the Tolmekians take over the Valley with their vast military army, kill the Valley's King and plan to take Nausicaa back to Tolmekia.  <br /> <br />On the way back, the Pejite launch a counterattack, led by their Prince Asbel. Asbel and Nausicaa go back to Pejite, and discover the Pejite military have launched counterattack which involves destroying the occupying Tolmelkian army in the Valley of the Wind. The death of the valley would be collateral damage.  <br /> <br />While this seems like a plot driven movie, there are two underlying themes throughout the movie. The first is the pettiness between nations to conquer others in the guise of protecting the weak against an evil foe (the toxic jungle) and the evils of this power against a fragile world that will defend itself from man's intervention. It is this geo-political-environmental theme that plays out in say Princess Mononoke (the natural world vs. man). I believe that Miyazake portrays this more subtlety than he does with Mononoke, where they have animal gods roaming throughout. The animation has become a touch outdated as the years have gone by, Miyazake has been outdone in person animate by anime auteurs such as Otomo and Oshi but in terms of creative design on an epic scale, I will say that no one comes close. I think the design of the Ohmu and the Ushiabu creatures were simply amazing at the time.  <br /> <br />Miyazake also fleshes out his celluloid characters and gives Nausicaa lots of character that is missing nowadays in an era of Diva's who would rather portray themselves than dive into a character. Nausicaa is a contradiction, being a pacifist and a warrior, a mature adult and child, girly yet strongly feminist, etc. She is voiced extremely well by Alison Lohman, who seems accurate in her voicing. Lord Yupa's voice was an inspired choice. Patrick Stewart has a deep, masterful and wise voice and it bodes well for the well worn traveller. Other actors like Uma Thurman, Chris Sarandon, and Edward James Olmos do a great job as well. The only voice I didn't like too much was Prince Asbel, voice monotonously by Shia LeBeouf (where was the beef in that performance Shia?)  <br /> <br />The movie is a little too violent for children and the Disney version is very clean with a good (but not great) sound transfer. It is a two disc, but the second disc is for Nausicaa nutz only because the only feature is the full length storyboard.  <br /> <br />Compared to Miyazaki's work, it ranks in the lower middle of his works. It was better than Lupin III and Porco Rosso and I liked it the same as My Neighbour Totoro and Princess Mononoke on story, but I feel it was inferior to Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, and Castle in the Sky. Still, even though it is not his best, it is better than any other direct to video animated movie this year.....Rating B+  <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|\\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" welcomes back the Mariah Carey we all know and love.  With the disappointing sales and vocal performances on both \\"Glitter\\" and \\"Charmbracelet\\", the public had pretty much wrote Mariah off as a 'has-been'.  Boy, did she come back and prove everyone wrong with this excellent effort!  Mariah really shines when she concentrates on old-school R&B/Soul gems like \\"Mine Again', \\"Circles\\" and the gospel-tinged \\"Fly Like A Bird\\", where the influence of her musical heroes Chaka Khan and Aretha Franklin are clearly evident.  \\"Mimi\\" marks the return of Mariah riding the top of the Pop & R&B charts again.  A position she so clearly deserves.
B0000BWVCM|2.0|The first one was better because it was something we had never seen before. Having read the comic books, I wondered if Hugh Jackman was a good choice to play the hardened Wolverine or if Halle Berry would make a good Storm.  <br /> <br />So the sequel is supposed to be bigger and better in it's action sequences because we have the background story as well, but it is not necessarily so in this movie. There is alot of action, but much of it is of the generic type. The fight between Mystique and Wolverine was much better than the one between Deathstrike and Wolverine (in this one the action was so cut and jerky that I couldn't see clearly half the time). I was not impressed with most of the characters and a few of them took a step backwards in this movie.  <br /> <br />The characters of Cyclops and Storm are key examples. It is hard to make Halle Berry asexual and unexciting, but Director Bryan Singer made it so. Cyclops comes off as a semi-gay, nsync fan who is the fall guy for the blossoming Wolverine/Jean Grey relationship. Other characters whose motivation is a mystery is Pyro. He's a jerk but for him to run off with Magneto and Mystique doesn't make sense.  <br /> <br />Another character that is weakened from the original movie is Rogue. In the first movie, she (played by the highly capable Anna Paquin) has a teen angst spin that was mildly interesting, but in this one she turns into a helpless, sniveling whiner who only is interested in getting it on with Iceman. However, they decide to expand the role of Iceman and he becomes more of a 3D character.  <br /> <br />Not all is lost though, Jean Grey is always interesting and fascinating and is played with appeal by Famke Janssen (even if she develops mysterious powers without explanation like Evy O'Connell from the \\"Mummy Returns\\"). She is by far the most facinating character in this movie.  <br /> <br />Not far behind is the new character \\"Nightcrawler\\", played by Alan Cumming. However, Singer does not spend enough time fleshing out the character and by the end of the movie, all we know is that he is German, was from a freakshow, has angelic carvings on his body and is very religious. They need to expand his role in X3.  <br /> <br />Rebecca Romaine-Stamos returns as the seductive (yet repulsive) Mystique. She is the fire of the group and is not afraid to show her emotions through the movie. Wolverine should be as upfront as she is.  <br /> <br />Overall, the feel of this movie is not different from a James Bond movie. There are the big set pieces, the mad conqueror, characters with interesting names and the world domination plot. It is not original, or even as good as the first movie and I'm sure that non followers will be stumped by the Phoenix plot of X3.....Rating: C- <br />
B00004YKUY|1.0|The only reason why I gave this album 1 star is because there is no opportunity to give it 'Zero' stars. <br /> <br />Journey is a novelty act. They've become the butt of many jokes. <br /> <br />File under: 'Mullet Rawk'.
B00005JL78|4.0|I critized movies such as Spiderman and Star Wars for having SFX that were too perfect, too shiny, making them look unreal. Minority report does not fall into this category. In fact the SFX in this movie is so good, people were amazed with what they saw on the screen. Of course, these are the same audiences that would like to see these SFX in action, rather in servitude to the movie plot and concept.  <br /> <br />In Washington DC, circa 2054, murder is wiped out because of a special division called the pre-crime unit that uses \\"pre-cogs\\" to see murders between 30 minutes to 4 days before they happen. It is a criminal experiment that is straight out of Orwells paranoid 1984, but it is successful enough to warrant a nationwide program. The head of the DC division is Director Burgess (Max Von Sydow) and it is led on the street by Detective John Anderton (Cruise). Anderton, (who falls under 2 standard movie rules 1. Ambition comes from personal tragedy and 2. Cannot have a girlfriend or wife because there is a possibility that he will get back together with an ex.) is possibly framed for the future murder of a person who he has never met and for most of the middle portion, he set out to prove his innocence. He is hunted by a Detective Ed Witwer, a DOJ investigator who has come to audit the program and becomes involved in this developing criminal case, as well as the members of his squad, led by Officer Fletcher (Neal McDonough). As he investigates the case further, he uncovers a conspiracy that may unravel the whole program.  <br /> <br />The movie is was filmed in the same washed out colors that he and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski used in the battle scene from Saving Private Ryan and parts of AI. It is an indicator that the future will be bleak and disparate, not surprising, since it was written by pessimist Philip Dick (Blade Runner) as a short story long ago. However, this type of estoteric sci-fi, which tackles current issues such as privacy and sacrificing people for the good of society is handled well by Spielberg and his screenwriters. The premise of the movie itself is fascinating, even though it is highly unlikely, but can be slow at moments. A few people walked out of the movie mid way through, probably because they were expecting MIB II. There was lots of visual eye candy that served the story and the plot, but it was not overly done and the things that appear on the screen looked so vivid, that it looked real. One example is Tom's magnetic car which pulls up to his home, the hover transport that drops the troops into location and the cops in backpack jet packs. Spielberg's commitment to detail should be commended.  <br /> <br />I did not like the ending of this movie that much. You knew that Cruise would get back together with his wife, you knew who was behind the crime. The whole scene involving Sydow's setup was a little too perfect for me. I was also sorting of hoping that Tom and Agatha would hook up instead.  <br />There is also a abundance of product placement, from USA Today, to Lexus to the Gap. Even scarier is the concept of \\"personalized advertising\\" and the fact that there are eye scanners everywhere.  <br /> <br />The acting was good overall. Stand outs were Colin Farrell as the worth adversary, Samantha Morton as Agatha, the shivering pre-cog and Cruise, who gets the thankless role of being the straight man. Max Von Sydow, who blew away years ago in the Exorcist and The Seventh Seal plays the role in which he is becoming typecast in. I won't reveal it, but if you watch alot of his movies, you'll know what I mean.  <br /> <br />There were consistencies I didn't like. One major one was Tom's eyes. How come they didn't change the retina codes to block out his eyes? How come he didn't go blind when he took off his bandages 6 hours early? Why didn't Anderton prove his innocence by not committing the murder? What was the purpose of setting Anderton up? How come the pre-cog couldn't figure out the murder of Anne Lively?  <br /> <br />These inconsistencies do not take away from the sheer entertainment value of this movie, both as a Summer blockbuster DVD as well as a thought provoking film about where our society is possibly heading....Rating: B <br />
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This album is just over a half an hour, but OH WHAT A HALF HOUR! I put this album on and bang...it's done and I play it again. The band shows how diverse they can be from SKA-like rhythms to METAL riffs to straight forward ROCK...all are influenced by sounds, scales and styles of Middle-Eastern music. The vocal harmonies between the singer and the guitar player are impressive. They show they are willing to take risks as musicians. I liked SOAD before, but now I love them and want to see them in concert!
B000286RNY|3.0|Director Stephen Chow plays a down on his luck Shaolin monk turned street bum named Sing in the chinese soccer version of Ladybugs, Major league, Bad News Bears and other movies where mitfits can become winners against an evil opponent.  <br /> <br />The story actually starts off with a tournament 20 years earlier with a confrontation between teammates \\"Golden Leg\\" Fung and Hung. Fung is the arrogant hero that misses the free kick at a crucial game and is attacked by the crowd. 20 years later Hung is now the boss of a National Soccer tournament and Fung is his lackey that is soon fired.  <br /> <br />Fung and Sing meet and at first Fung doesn't see the purpose of integrating Shaolin Kung Fu into a soccer tournament, but after seeing him in action against a group of thugs, he quickly changes his mind. Sing gathers his usual suspects, a group of ex-shaolin monks that have moved on with their life. There is a Bruce Lee lookalike that is umemployed, a stock broker who can suck a ball into his lap, a huge 200 lb grocery stock boy who can jump 50 feet at a time, a janitor who can breakdance with a soccer ball and a nightclub lackey who has an iron head, which comes in handy since the owner always seems to be smashing a bottle over his head for his incompetence.  <br /> <br />The group enter the National Soccer tournament and at first practice, they suck. However, as they improve, they become the team to beat and Hung is getting worried that his Steroid/Chemical enhanced team won't be up to par to win the $1M prize. More importantly, will Sing's goal to make Shaolin Kung Fu more famous succeed?  <br /> <br />As you can see, the plot of this movie is secondary to each individual scene. As vignettes, this movie does very well. Stephen Chow is charismatic as Sing and his love interest Mui is also appropriately meek. However, the relationship is flawed from the beginning. There is chemistry spart between them, and Chow has to work on it real hard in order to make it work.  <br/> <br />There are other comedic points that seem strange to Western Audiences. The cross dressing hair-dresser scene seems completely out of place, as is the fact that Mui accepts mid-80's shoulder pad fashion as \\"in\\". To someone who's been to Hong Kong, that just doesn't make sense. It also doesn't make sense for two soccer players (Karen Mok and Cecillia Cheung) to be wearing moustaches and beards, but maybe that's a cultural thing.  <br /> <br />The SFX is also hit and miss. Of course, this is a lower budget movies, so some scenes, especially to do with bodies flying through the air, don't work and look really fake. However, some other scenes, especially during the soccer games are not so bad and actually exciting to watch. The final game is also the pinnacle of the movie, because they actually meet their match against guys straight out of the \\"Universal Soldier\\" movies.  <br /> <br />It is a good movie that appeals to Eastern tastes more than anything and while Miramax seems to have bought the international rights to this movie, I don't see it having wide appeal to non-Asian audiences (especially to those people who couldn't accept the movie \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\"). However, to me, I thought it was a pleasing timewaster....Rating: C  <br />
0312263120|2.0|This is supposed to be a thriller, but the plot is so contrived and unrealistic that my reaction was simply to race through the easy reading to see if there was any satisfaction in the ending (There isn't).  Anyone with understanding of computers, viruses, or encryption will have a hard time plowing through the unbelievable plot line.  When the adventures of the college professor (incredibly sent by the NSA to Spain to retrieve a critical decryption key) reveal him to be more capable and spy-savvy than James Bond and able to not only avoid but kill a trained assassin, credibility goes out the window. <br /> <br />The author apparently thought that an abundance of exclamation marks would satisfy the criteria for a thriller, but the net effect reminded me of a juvenile Hardy Boys tale.
B00005JKZV|4.0|Contains spoilers.  <br /> <br />Having seen the Toronto premier, I must say that I was very pleased with the Two Towers. It is not only spectacular in it's SFX and set design, it provides us characters, both CGI and human, that are interesting. However, it may upset (not me though) LOTR junkies because it is not completely faithful to the book.  <br /> <br />The first scenes of the movie had me hooked, where they go back to the battle between Gandalf and the Demonic Balrog under the mines of Moria. As in the first book, Gandalf seems to be lost, but they extend the battle as the two mighty characters seem to fall to the center of the earth. It is an amazing scene that will have your mouth gaping. However, that is shown as a dream sequence to Frodo/Sam's quest to get to Mount Doom to destroy the ring of power.  <br /> <br />The other plotline has Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli tracking a party of Uruk-hai who have kidnapped Merry and Pippen (the other two Hobbits). However, by the time they reach them, all the orcs are killed by the Riders of the Rohiddim, soldiers of a Kingdom called Rohan. The party discover that the hobbits were not killed but hid in the mysterious Fangorn forest, a mystic place that mortals dare not enter. They meet up with Gandalf in the forest and head to Rohan, since he has found the hobbits and left them in the protection of the Ents, a tree race that protects Fangorn.  <br /> <br />In the capital of Rohan, they find out about Saruman and Isengards march of 10000 orcs to destroy their land. The King is under the spell of an evil sage named Grim Wormtongue and Gandalf breaks the spell. Wormtongue is banished and heads to his true master, Saruman. The Rohan's abanddon their city and head towards Helm's Deep, their siege fort, where they will make their last stand. Saruman, knowing this, sends his troops there, hoping to block them off and destroy Rohan. Meanwhile, Gandalf goes to find the King's nephew Eomer, who was banished by the King while hewas under the spell of Wormtongue.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile Merry and Pippen meet Treebeard, one of the oldest Ents. They try to convince him that Saruman has become evil but the Ents have no interest in joining the war, until they find out that Saruman is destroying the forests to run his great underground steel mill. They have a change of heart and prepare for the siege on Isengard.  <br /> <br />Finally, Frodo meets and captures Gollum, the adversary of Bilbo Baggins in the book \\"The Hobbit\\". As they prepare to finish him off, Gollum tells them that they cannot enter Mordor because Sauron has built a giant gate and offers an alternative way in. During this way, they fall in between a conflict between the Harzad (servants of Sauron) and the fighters of Gondor. They are captured by Faramir, the brother of Boromir and will be taken to Miras Tinir to have the ring given to his father to fight the war.  <br /> <br />As you can see, the plot is dense but Director/Writer Peter Jackson fills in much of the holes. He also adds parts that are not in the novel, such as the love triangle between Aragorn, Eowyn and Arwen. Also, in the second part, I don't remember the Elves escaping from Rivendell to their ancient homeland of Valoria across the sea, nor do I remember a legion of Elves under Haldir going to assist the Rohan's defenses, but for me, these were not negatives, but helped with the plot. As well, in the book, the first half is devoted to Helm's Deep and Isengard, while the second half is the quest. It is broken up here, but IMO, that was a good thing since JRR's way would have bored people cinematically.  <br /> <br />Other differences from the book is that Aragorn and his party do not meet up with the Ents and the Hobbits in Isengard and the movie ends about 50 pages before the novel does and you do not get to meet \\"her\\" (LOTR fans will know what I'm talking about).  <br /> <br />For those who have not read the novels, there maybe some confusion where characters orpeople appear out of nowhere, but were discussed in the book (like the Ents), or Faramir happening to be the brother of Boromir. I also suggest that those who have not seen the original LOTR: FOTR or watched in a while, rent it againt to be refreshed.  <br /> <br />Of the the new characters, Smeagol-Gollum is the best. Jackson makes Smeagol pathetic enough to be sympathetic to the audience (especially with his big eyes and naive childish attitude), but makes Gollum evil enough to make him seem like a real threat. Smeagol also is the best CGI character I've seen to date. After a few minutes, you would think that he existed in real life. Andy Serkis does an amazing job with the voice. John Rhys-Davis does the best here, injecting humor into his Gimli character (the reference to Dwarf tossing is timeless) and with the towering voice of Treebeard. Other new characters that support the movie well are Karl Urban who plays Eomer, David Wenham who plays Faramir and Brad Dourif who plays the slimy Grima Wormtongue.  <br /> <br />I was not impressed with Miranda Otto as Eowyn, mostly because she is supposed to have major chemistry with Aragorn (Viggo Mortesen) but doesn't and I was also unhappy with Frodo, because in the novel, he goes from fresh faced no-nothing to a wiser person, but Jackson instead played up his \\"turmoil\\" with the ring. He is also supposed to have a fatherly role with Smeagol-Gollum, but it does not come through on screen.  <br /> <br />Finally, the battle scenes....Yes they are amazing and tremendous to take in, but it was sensory overload at times. It just keeps going and going and becomes wearisome after a while. But don't get me wrong, this was a minor complaint. I know this movie is supposed to be darker than the first movie, but let me tell you, it made Gimli's jokes all that funnier.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is probably the \\"Don't miss\\" movie of the Christmas season. I give Peter Jackson and the whole crew kudos for making a movie that will bothentertain and memorable....Rating: B  <br />
0375507256|4.0|Six stories spreading from the 19th century to after the fall of civilisation, 3 playing in the past, 2 in the future and 1 in what might be the present time. All very different, yet all related to each other: from an American notary on a clipper in the Pacific, via a young composer, a journalist in the 1970s, an elderly book publisher, a fabricant in a world that shows what will happen if we become too consumption-oriented to one of the few suvivors of the Fall of civilization. And a different form and type of English is choosen for each section. <br /> <br />This is the book that nearly won the Booker Prize 2004. After Ghostwritten this is the second book by David Mitchell that I have read and again he shows how he enjoys playing with language, connecting apparently unrelated stories, so really a feast to read. However, one wonders whether the author is also capable of using other formats. I'll find this out by reading Number9dream in the near future...
B00005JKED|3.0|Movies about \\"the streets\\" are not uncommon. Movies like Colors have gone through this in the past. Training Day is no different, but this films is head and shoulder above the others due to the main leads.  <br /> <br />Ethan Hawke plays Jake Hoyt, a young, ambitious cop who gets a shot at the high profile Narcotics Squad. He is going through a \\"Training day\\" with Detective Alonzo Harris, a tough 13 year veteran with 15,000 man-hours worth of arrests under his belt.  <br /> <br />Right off, Hoyt, who is still idealistic, is given the harsh brutality of the streets both through Harris' descriptions and events, such as seeing a girl being raped on the street. However, there is a plot associated with this movie and it involves Alonzo Harris and a certain Russian mafia figure. This \\"relationship\\" sets the underlying premise throughout the whole movie and explains the dual nature of Harris' character that came about sort of as a shock near the 2/3rd point of the movie.  <br /> <br />Let me first say that I don't believe that Denzel role as the Rogue Cop deserved an Oscar win. He has done better work in movies like Malcolm X and The Hurricane. However, he is the strong point of the movie. His Alonzo Harris is both ruthless and father-figurish and has an appeal that hooks Hoyt in. He truly is a wolf in sheep's clothing. He steals every scene he is in and takes command of the movie from Ethan Hawke. This is natural since Hawke plays the character as a learner (aka the straight man), but he manages to get a lot of empathy from the audience and provides the needed integrity that Hoyt strives for.  <br /> <br />The storyline, while generic, is well filmed by Antoine Fuqua. His previous attempts (Bait, The Replacement Killers) were failures, but he does redeem himself with this movie. He lenses the evil that lies on the inner city streets and those who know LA through movies such as LA Story maybe surprised how dark the City of Angels can be. While this movie does not put the city in the best of lights, Fuqua does a great job showing the dangerous realities of LA, including introducing low live characters such as Blue (Snoop Dogg), Smiley (Cliff Curtis) and Crazy Sniper (Raymond Cruz). However, he can't get around the generic story and predictable ending and that puts a damper on the movie itself.  <br /> <br />However, if you want to see an action movie that is a cut above the rest, Training Day would fit the ticket....Rating: B-  <br /> <br />Note: Harris shows Hoyt a picture of himself when he was younger. However, it is a picture of Nick Styles....A character that Denzel Washington played in Ricochet. <br />

B0009A1AS2|4.0|Like many, I have become tired of Dream Theater's often tasteless and excessive nature, and seeing as how that side of the band has become more and more pronounced over past albums, finally culminating in the painfully dull and mechanical \\"Train of Thought\\", my expectations for this album were not especially high.  However, it gives me great pleasure to say that \\"Octavarium\\" is the most well-written,  musically balanced, and generally the best album the band has made in many years.<br /><br />There are still plenty of chops on display here, as has always been the case with Dream Theater's music, but gone are the long periods of pointless exhibitionism that dominated the last release.  Here, the instrumentation is there to serve the song, and the musicianship is almost always interesting.  There is also some of the best balance between heaviness and melody that has ever been on display in the band's music.  There are a few fast, heavy tracks, mixed with slower, simpler ballads, epics mixed with shorter songs, and the overall flow of the album is fantastic.  And best of all, James Labrie's vocals are much more smooth and restrained, and there is none of the shrieky histrionics of the past.  I'd say that it's overall his best vocal performance to date.<br /><br />The album begins with a bang, with the all-out metallic fury of \\"The Root of All Evil\\".  This song, along with the equally vicious \\"Panic Attack\\", is what \\"Train of Thought\\" should have sounded like: bloodthirsy heaviness, without the neverending wack-off interludes to drag them down.  Each of these has manic shredding, but only in a small part of the song, rather than dominating a huge chunk of it.<br /><br />These two songs bookend three ballads, and while that may sound like overkill, it is anything but, as they are all very different from each other.  \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" is very soft and gentle, consisting mostly of piano and strings, and has sort of a Coldplay vibe.  \\"I Walk Beside You\\" is more Muse/U2 inspired, with a killer string-synth melody, and a soaring, catchy chorus.  \\"These Walls\\" is sort of a semi-ballad, mixing moody melodies with big guitar hooks, and building into a huge Pink Floyd-like guitar solo.  This is one of their best songs yet, for sure.<br /><br />\\"Never Enough\\" is easily the weakest track, and the main reason I can't quite give this album five stars.  Aside from Mike Portnoy's whiny lyrics about how no one appreciates him (I have a huge rant to go along with this, but I'll spare you for now), the song is just largely boring, with weak vocal melodies, and so-so music.  It sounds like they threw this in just so Mike could get the lyrical subject off his chest (and hopefully he did get all of it out), and didn't pay much attention to the music to go along with it.<br /><br />The album ends with two epics.  The first, \\"Sacrificed Sons\\", is a belated tribute to 9-11, and although they don't say anything here that hasn't been said before (planes crashed, how could they do this, etc), the song comes off as emotionally sincere.  Musically, it's a bit slow to build up, but once it really gets going it turns out to be a pretty good song.<br /><br />However, the second epic, the title track, is where the album really hits its high point.  At 24 minutes, it is the band's longest song yet (if you don't count 6DOIT as one song), and easily one of their best.  Ranging from beautiful orchestral melodies, to peppy Yes-like keyboards, to a thrilling, wacky \\"Metropolis Part 1\\" style instrumental part, to a brief moment of heaviness in which James almost sounds like Devin Townsend (and surprisingly sounds pretty good doing it), this song is just a huge roller coaster of awesomeness.  This is easily up there with \\"A Change of Seasons\\", \\"Learning to Live\\", or any of the band's other masterworks.<br /><br />This album has rekindled my interest in Dream Theater in a huge way.  It's not perfect, but it's certainly much better than the last couple of albums.  Ionly hope they can keep this high quality up for the next album.  Sure, this isn't quite up there with \\"Awake\\" or \\"Images and Words\\", but it's pretty darn close.ouple of albums.  I only hope they can keep this high quality up for the next album.

0375507256|4.0|Not to start off on a separate topic but I actually found this book on Amazon by reading reviews. I don't know if I am the only one doing this but since I don't really have any friends that read regularly I had a shortage of recommendations. I started reading reviews of books that I liked and then read the peoples other reviews that rated the books I like similarly and I stumbled across Cloud Atlas.<br /><br />I came across this book at a good time. I have been reading fantasy so long and have been disappointed with a lot that I had read lately, so a genre change was in order. No point in repeating what everyone else has already said, 6 stories all connected etc. etc. etc.... What I will say is the book was pretty enjoyable.<br /><br />The good: The stories were all very well written. The different characters from each were very distinguished. The stories were cleverly interwoven with one another and all break off at the key time to make you want to hurry up and get back too them. I also enjoyed the fact that all of the stories are not written in typical story format. One of the stories is the character's journal; one of them is 16 letters sent from one of the characters to his friend. Another one is an interview about events that had already past. This change up in style made it interesting.<br /><br />The Bad: Not really much. The last story felt like it drug a little. You might have to break out your dictionary a time or two, though that may not actually be bad.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book though, worth picking up and reading.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|This soundtrack is absolutely awsome! I had heard pieces of it, but did not listen to all of it until this past May. I ended up with two of my best friends sitting on our high school stage about two hours before our musical listening to this soundtrack and eating Chinese food. By the time we were finished, we had listened to a ton of the soundtrack and were probably five times calmer than we had been when we started. We ended up doing the same thing the following night, and have decided to make it a tradition.
1582432678|5.0|The publicity surrounding the awarding of Britain's Orange Prize to Shriver (for  the best novel in the English language published by a woman) said that 20 publishers turned down \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin.\\" Or was that 30? At any rate, that's a clue to how grating the first fifty or so pages of this novel are, as Shriver puts us in the head of Kevin's mom, Eva, as she overthinks the conception and birth of her firstborn.<br /><br />That is not a comfortable place to be. Eva is that still-odd self-made American woman, a woman who turned her penchant for cheap foreign travel into a thriving publishing house of guides. It is her identity in that role that she clings to as her husband, whom she treasures, pulls her toward motherhood and the suburbs. Eva's struggle against these forces, including her self-imposed stereotypes, sets her up for what is to follow, and readers should question her reliability as a narrator.<br /><br />The Columbine connection aside, this is ground covered by Doris Lessing in \\"The Fifth Child,\\" a novel of the 1970s that the Orange judges must know well. Lessing proffered the premise that there is such a thing as a bad seed, a child who from birth is bent on evil. Early on, Eva seems to agree with her, but Shriver's premise is far more complicated. As I read her, it's possible that an infant's peculiarities can be so misread by its parents that they nurture a monster while following their best intentions. That's far scarier, and it helps explain some readers' aversion to this powerful and challenging book.It's not a book to read before you fall asleep at night, but one to read in a full, upright position in daylight.<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted Shriver's devastating skewering of atrocity-driven media. I would also urge readers to look to her portrait of the novel's \\"innocents,\\" Eva's husband, Franklin, to whom the novel is addressed, and their daughter, Celia, who Eva finds an easy baby but never adequately protects. Being good passively is not enough, she seems to say. We deceive ourselves at our own peril. Only the strong, like Eva and Kevin, survive in this America, and what they inherit isn't what they long for.<br /><br />The one exception to this grim assessment is Dana Rocco, a teacher who sees through Kevin's bluster to the emptiness it hides. \\"Tell Kevin I'm on to him,\\" she tells Eva at parent-teacher conference. Sadly, she's too lateod passively is not enough, she seems to say. We deceive ourselves at our own peril.

B0000085N4|5.0|This album represents The Cult at the height of their career.  Granted, they have alot of great records, but this one is the best.  This record is also one of the best hard rock albums from the 80s-90s era.  The song writing combined with Bob Rock's production make this record a treat for the ears.

B00005QXDD|5.0|I am not sure where I was when I first heard some lyrics from Jack Black and Kyle.  I remember it was animated, but that was all.  So, with some hesitation I picked up their initial album.  Not sure what I was about to jump into, I placed the CD into my player and opened my ears.  To my surprise, it was nothing but sheer humor, grandiose music (from two people that truly are passionate about the music), and a brilliant compilation of pop culture references.  To me, this is the ultimate rock album to listen to.<br /><br />Let me explain further.  To fully enjoy this album, you must first put aside all your inner cinematic hatred or dislike that you have for Jack Black.  For me, he doesn't do anything at all on screen.  I have seen a couple of his films, but nothing that screamed back to me that he was going to be the biggest star Hollywood has encountered.  It is that hesitation that I carried with me into the album.  To my surprise, it was much different.  Black's humor was perfection, while his music carried that melody and verse that remains with you throughout the rest of the day.  Kyle's participation in the record could have been more, but remained dominate throughout.  The addition of Dave Grohl on several of the tracks showed me that perhaps Tenacious D was more than just some \\"bubble-gum\\" humor band, but instead a defiant cog against the music machine.  There was something inspirational about Black's humor coupled with some of the hardest riffs this side of the Def Leopard or Skid Row.<br /><br />I encourage those timid to pick this album up to give it a try.  I am not a huge fan of the hard rock genre of music, yet somehow this album worked wonders in my mind.  It was hysterical, musical, and a genius beginning album to a group that could be the next \\"Spinal Tap\\".<br /><br />I applaud Tenacious D, and look forward to enjoying their future film and current DVD release.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien Rice's O is perhaps on of the best CD's I have heard for a long time, in the same category as Maroon 5, Tori Amos, Radiohead and Coldplay (at least for me, anyway) <br /> <br />The beautiful lyrics, and emotion conveyed through the music and his voice has honestly caused me to weep every time I hear him, but his music is the only music to help me let go of everything and relax.  <br /> <br />\\"The Blower's Daughter\\" in undoubtedly the masterpiece of this album... never have I heard a song that has kept me captivated for so long, with the exception of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\". <br /> <br />\\"Amie\\" and \\"Prague\\" are my other favourite songs from the album... <br /> <br />What more can I say? Rice has really proved himself on O. Looking forward to hearing more of this enigma.
0743243315|4.0|One of my professors assigned this book as required reading for a history class.  Although I never would have picked it up for myself based on the description, I quickly found that I was unable to put this book down and forget about it -- in fact I finished it well before the due date. <br /> <br />The language in this book makes the settings come alive for the reader; Nazneen, the protagonist, exists in a very lush environment defined by rich sensory details.  Ali does not glaze over descriptions of the main locales, most notably Nazneen and Chanu's apartment, which she describes in lavish detail.  She does the same for her characters, painting lively portraits of toady Chanu (and making the reader feel Nazneen's conflicted revulsion and affection for the man), rebellious Razia and her sometimes volatile interactions with native Britons, and sickly Mrs. Islam in the role of the money lender, who echoes the theme of debt and payment from other South Asian works.  The total effect is immersion into Nazneen's world and a genuine interest in all of the characters. <br /> <br />I agree with many of the other reviewers who say that Hasina's letters make for a laborious read.  They are not, however, completely divorced from the rest of the book, and deserve at least a good skim.   <br /> <br />If you are expecting Nazneen's affair to be torrid and sensual, you will certainly be disappointed.  Nazneen becomes more infatuated with a set of ideals than she does with the man himself, so don't go into this book expecting a juicy love story.  Also, readers who expect a clear-cut problem and resolution will find this book unfulfilling, because the issues with which it grapples are more vague than the affair itself or any singular problem.  In spite of this, Brick Lane provides a unique window into the lives of London immigrants that richly invites the reader to take a new perspective and experience the everyday tragedies and triumphs of these immigrants in an unforgettable way.
B00005JNJT|5.0|To the idiot who quoted the film as 'foregin' and that Batman is American and should be all done by Americans is the single most obsured thing EVER! it proves that certain people cannot like a film purely because of the choice of 'foreign' directors/actors. Being British i feel dissapointed that people can get away with it *cough* ruined The Office, Friends was awful *cough* and blame us! anyway the film - high class action thorughout and great story telling, read Batman: Year One for more detailed info. Christian Bale was superb and Michael Caine as Alfred was a wise choice! all in all a fine film, no matter what some patriotic, lovingcountryflagwavingnationlist people think!
B00008DDJT|5.0|I won't beat about the bush: I LOVED THIS MOVIE! It was so exciting, I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through. At times, I even began to cheer!     I've been stuck in bed sick these last few days and I've had to endure watching some dreadful movies in that time. But this was a great change from those. Out of all the movies I've watched lately, this was far and away the best one.    The storyline of this movie is not entirely original--it definitely borrows elements from Mad Max, George A. Romero's Day of the Dead, and John Wyndham's book The Day of the Triffids. But all three of those were absolutely brilliant, and so is this.    I noticed that one Amazon reviewer complained that they could not understand the accents in this movie. Well, I would advise that reviewer to get their hearing checked because I didn't have a problem with the accents at all. If you can't understand the occasional very mild Scottish accent, you really need to get a life. FYI, though, most of the characters in this speak with an English or American accent, neither of which should be too hard for persons of average intelligence to understand.    I also read reviews that claimed there were too few dragons and not enough drama in this movie. Jeeze, those reviewers so didn't get it. As I saw it, there was a good reason why the dragons weren't onscreen the whole time and it had to do with building drama: the drama was actually in the 'when will the dragons come, will they find us, oh God, is that just the wind outside or the sound of a dragon coming to get us, aaargh!' type suspense. Silence of the Lambs didn't just feature Hannibal Lector and the other serial killer slaughtering people all the way through it--it relied on the suspense factor, the 'what will happen next?' feeling, the build up, the psychology. Suspense = drama, and in this movie, if the dragons were on screen the whole time, you'd lose that. (Be assured, though, that plenty of dragons do appear, and when they do, they'reawesome!) Also, the reviewers seemed to miss the scintillating psychological drama of the 'enemy within' component of the story. The people living in the fortress were unsure about whether the well-armed and scary looking American soldiers they were letting into their midst were friends or foe. Were these new humans in fact more dangerous to them than the dragons outside? That was the same thing I loved about Romero's 'Day of the Dead', and I thought it worked well in this movie too. Let's face it, some people are scarier than the worst of Hollywood monsters, and the military certainly has its fair share of these people.     I could go on for hours pointing out the flaws in some of the other reviews, but I won't bother. If people want to be dumb, let 'em. There are some logic gaps in this movie's script, sure, but not nearly as many as the other reviewers say. Watch this for the entertainment value, not just to nitpick, and you won't be disappointed.    I loved the sense of humour in this movie--it may be set in a grim 'end of the world' scenario where the few survivors are forced to live in almost medieval conditions, but the people prove that they can still have a laugh and keep themselves entertained. (You MUST check out the 'Star Wars' panto they put on, it's an absolute hoot.)    The cast is top notch. Matthew McConaughy is awesome, and such an over-the-top gung-ho army guy that he's almost scarier than the dragons. Christian Bale is inspiring--he's strong, but at the same time very human and vulnerable, a good guy caught in a very bad situation. And Gerard Butler is as lovely as he always is in movies, and yet, very tough and heroic--girls, as if you needed another reason to watch this, there it is!    There was never a slow moment in this movie. The action was brilliant, the fiery explosions were good and big and loud, and the special effect that allows us to see the world through a dragon's eyes was pretty cool. But the coolest part was when you get to seethe world through the eyes of guys who are falling from a helicopter without a parachute whilst trying to hunt a dragon--I've got a fear of heights, but even I couldn't look away, it was so compelling.    Watch this, I urge you, but be warned--you might wear out the edge of your seat! And your lungs, too, as you cheer the heroes on.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I would have never guessed that I would ever be such a fan of a band with former members of \\"At the Drive In.\\"  I'm just not a fan of that end of new music, but when I heard this, I was stunned.  I am a big fan of progressive rock, namely Dream Theater, Pain of Salvation and Symphony X.  With that attitude, it's hard for most rock bands to measure up in any way.  While the Mars Volta is a very different type of band than the above, I was able to immediately recognize some progressive elements to their music.  The lightning fast and frequent tempo and timing changes, the sheer musicianship, the lenghty songs with continuously evolving moods and song structures--all help create something any progressive rock fan can admire.  But the intrigue of the Mars Volta is not in their prog-rock bravado, but in their striking originality.  This is purely genre-defying rock music.  The vocals, guitars, bass (Flea guest-appears on bass) and drums are outstanding.  I can easily see fans of progressive rock, rock, metal, punk and even fans of the filth known as emo enjoying every minute of Deloused in the Comatorium.
0393035158|5.0|Mr. Harris makes a clear and concise statement as to religion and how it has affected us all.  With all the trouble with the Islam religion today, it takes just a short look back to where Christians were behaving in just the same fashion.<br /><br />To understand the forces that are in play today you need to understand the central issues. This book frames the current climate of Islamic terrorists within religious belief, not poverty, politics, or any other percieved reason.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, and would agree with the book reviewer that the later chapters are not as compeling as the earlier ones.  It is a good read!
B000000H4V|5.0|This was the first Sepultura album I bought, and I say it's a good place to start for new fans. This album has it all: killer guitar solos, well-written lyrics, pounding drums, neat bass-lines, pissed-off vocals, what else do you need? This album contains angry vocals & lyrcs and great rhythm guitar work from Max Cavalera, killer guitar solos from Andreas Kisser, great bass from Paulo Jr., and great drumming from Igor Cavalera (Max's brother). Read on for my track ratings.<br /><br />1. Refuse/Resist - Great album opener. Like the lyric \\"No man's land/What is this ***t?\\" 5/5<br /><br />2.

Not bad, but not my favorite. \\"Biotech, biotech, biotech is AIDS? STOP!!!!\\" 4.5/5<br /><br />8. Nomad - Great song, secod best. 5/5<br /><br />9. We Who Are Not As Others - Great music, but lyrics are repatative as hell. Worst song on the album. 3.5/5<br /><br />10. Manifest - 5/5<br /><br />11. The Hunt - 5/5<br /><br />12. Clenched Fist - Exellent and heavy was to end a great album. 5/5<br /><br />-BONUS TRAX-<br /><br />13. Chaos B.C. - A remix of \\"Refuse/Resist\\". Decent, but the original version is much better. 4/5<br /><br />14. Kaiowas [Tribal Jam] - The same song is just being played live with a South American tribe. 5/5<br /><br />15. Territory [Live] - \\"WAR FOR TERRITORY!!!\\" Awesome live. 5/5<br /><br />16. Amen/Inner Self [Live] - TWO great songs even better live! 5/5<br /><br />This, as you can see, is a great album. Just stick with the first six albums. That Derek Greene idiot can't match Max Cavalera.
1400076943|3.0|There is no denying the appeal of Adicie's story which many readers have summarized and appreciated. But the reader needs to be aware of the political and religious positions the author holds. First, that European, colonial-sponsored missionary Catholicism seems to beget only sadists and tyrants, abused children and beaten spouses. (Note how Eugene is, finally, depicted as a victim of missonary sadism rather than of his own moral choices.) Africanized Christianity on the other hand seems to inspire only happy families and well-balanced people, mostly women. The love affair between the 30-something African priest and the 15 year old heroine is presented in wholly positive terms; the violation in spirit if not in physical intimacy of the priestly vow of celibacy is viewed with amused toreance and good humored innuendoes.   <br />So it's a beautifully written touching tale, but beneath the appealing surface lurks the anti-colonial, anti-Catholic, anti-male liberal bias that is at the core of so much  \\"serious literature\\" today.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|Not great, not bad. I won't go rating every songs one by one here since I'm quite low on time, but I'll say this : Dream Theater have been a stone rolling down hill since ToT, and this album doesn't really help the situation. The first thing I thought when I heard the first 4 songs was \\"commercial\\". No interesting, progressive riffs at all, just plain and straight riffs. Even the greatest guitar player ever didn't have much to say on this album : In fact, there are only three solos, and one of them is made exclusively from guitar noises a-la-Kerry King. As a whole, the music composition on this cd isn't really interesting. <br /> <br />And don't get me started on the lyrics either. <br /> <br />Listen to the last song, but don't expect anything real great.  <br />Much Better than Train of thought- but this is still crappy
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|On their third official studio album (counting out the Steal This Album cd, which was a compilation of b-sides from the Toxicity sessions), System of a Down matures in a way that should make many die-hard fans excited.      Producer Rick Rubin has grown with the band together, as a team.  On their self-titled debut, he taught them how to achieve the maximum impact out of their riffs, thus creating songs that would easily coax a live audience into a moshing frenzy.  On Toxicity, he taught them how to effectively use their melodic side and smash it together with their metallic side without making the songs too frantic or confusing.  Having learned from those past two efforts, guitarist Daron Malakian has stepped up as co-producer and to give credit where its due, this album is really his opus;  He plays bass on all but three of the songs, though your average listener would never notice. He sings lead vocals for as much, if not more, on the record than vocalist Serj Tankian.  But together, their harmonies blend together so well, and so much better than they have on all the last albums.    Overall the album is something of a concept about their upbringing and how the media has influenced their childhood (as in \\"Radio/Video\\") as well as how the Hollywood culture and the media have worked together to corrupt the lives of the city's inhabitants (\\"Lost In Hollywood\\").    It's a deep look into their personal attitudes and beliefs, maybe more personal than some people may be comfortable with.  I wondered at times why they have so much vehemence (or why they feels its necessary to place such anger) towards Hollywood in contrast to the much more important political issues they discuss in songs like \\"Cigaro\\" and \\"B.Y.O.B.\\".      What makes this great though is that on virtually every song, the music perfectly accompanies every lyric, and it's all about attitude and emotion.  And because human emotions at times can be somewhat complex, they don't hesitate to integrate other musical genres to best convey each emotion.  In \\"Radio/Video\\", they weave in and out of a captivating Armenian-inspired melody to generate images of them playing with childhood friends... fast forward to a hard-rocking chorus.  \\"Cigaro\\" is just a great, in-your-face number about corrupt diplomats, and \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\" is pure, wacky, vintage System at its best.    The great thing about this cd is that you don't skip on any songs.  It's a very short album (11 songs at just 36:31) and you don't want to miss a single second of it.  The shortness of the album is my only personal complaint, I wish they had just released the whole cd as a double set.  All in all, I would have to say out of any genre of music (I'm an avid fan of everything from jazz to hip-hop), this is the Album of the Year so far for 2005.
B00063MBU8|1.0|how to make it big in the rock and roll industry <br /> <br />1. Dress up like anarchists, but write songs about how crappy it is being an adolescent in a middle class society in Canada <br />2. write a bunch of songs for the radio and if you get the big paycheck, do the same thing for your next album, only change a chord or two. <br />3. get on TRL and have your customers also pick out selections from Ashlee Simpson. <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|3.0|Listening to this album will take the average person about a week to fully digest, as it is for me.  The overall soundscape, however, is instantly captivating.      X&Y at its best is definitely grandiose.  I did feel though at times that the emotionally climactic riffing that the band does so well was a bit over-used, and thus sounded somewhat monotonous at times.  There needs to be more \\"lows\\" in the dynamics department to be able to appropriately engage the listener when the \\"climax\\" of the song is reached.  Imagine if you were at a punk rock show, and all of the songs were intense, and the amps were cranked to 11 the whole time.  It can be a bit much.  The same is true with the elevated, transcendental emotion that Coldplay wants to convey throughout the cd.    In terms of catchiness and instant gratification, this is not such a record.  The memorable and immortal hooks from A Rush of Blood to the Head are sparse.  That can tend to make a cd forgettable in most cases when a cd just sounds like one long song.    BUT this is Coldplay, and even though I feel like it sounds like one long song that spans 62 minutes, it is a GREAT 62 minutes!  The lyrics overall are both personal and provide insightful commentary on a variety of human issues.  And you can definitely feel the passion from beginning to end, which I believe is the most important factor of great music.  The people who were introduced to Coldplay via their interest in Radiohead would definitely dig this; both X&Y and maybe say Kid A are based on a concept open to interpretation, both electronically experimental, and both full of heart.
0743454537|5.0|I read this book months ago and it's still with me. I still think about and ponder why Jodi Picoult decided to end the book the way she did. I was totally shocked by the end of the story. I commend Jodi Picoult for making her story realistic, even if the ending is heartbreaking.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This is my favorite album!! Every song is a 4-5 star rating. This <br />album is what heavy metal fans need. My personal favorite is Telegraph Road (14). Now I'll review all the songs in order. <br /> <br />Telegraph Road 5/5 Starts the album with nothing. I like the lyrics. I love the ending to this song, really rock n roll! This <br />is my favorite song on this album, very long 14 minutes of great excellence.  <br /> <br />Private Investigations 4/5 I love this song! At first I never <br />liked this song because it was slow. Then it grew on me and I like it a lot! Anyway it's a nice song with great acoustic work <br />on. One of the best on this album.  <br /> <br />Industrial Disease 5/5 At first, I didn't like this song because <br />it wasnt really Dire Straits. It was more of a british song than <br />a Dire Straits song. Then it started to grow on me and I like it <br />a lot! This is an amazing song! I like the way it starts. A very <br />good song, one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Love over Gold 5/5 Actully a great acoustic tune! One of my other <br />favorites on this. The lyrics are 100 percent great! Everything <br />is just perfect in this song.  <br /> <br />It Never Rains 5/5 A great closer! This is my second favorite to <br />Telegraph and has some great heavy metal at the end.

055357342X|5.0|Incredible is the word I'm thinking of. I've read many fantasy genre books by many different authors in the past couple of years. George R. R. Martin is one of the few that constantly writes engaging books. \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" if it continues to be this good will be without second-thought be one of the best fantasy series ever. The plot is tight (you will not be reading long parts of characters wandering away from the storyline). The characters are well drawn (very few gets the fantasy stereotype of being either really good or really evil, for every character it's a matter of perspective). And the twists in the book really makes the reader gasp instead of causing rolled eyes. Other consistently good authors to check: Orson Scott Card, Ursula K. Leguin , and Martha Wells.
B000002MJR|5.0|This is a pure hard rock album that Heavy metal fans must have!! <br />Also, On the Night is one of the greatest hard rock CDs ever released.

B00005OCMR|2.0|There are two types of people: those who like TRON and those who don't. I don't like it. The special effects may have been revolutionary in their time, but that's no reason to watch the movie now, with CG that any seven-grader can conjure up on his PC at home. It should be noted that Tron bears a suspicious amount of similarities to Star Wars (Stormtroopers, Tie Fighters etc) however considering the amazing-in 1982- human interaction within a computer world; the highlight is Wendy Carlos' techno musical score. Steven Lisberger's second film shows the director's lack of talent for sharp pacing and original screenplay. Apart from Jeff Bridges, this is a no-name cast who do really poorly, but it's not their fault, you can still see movies like the Star Wars prequels where actors have nothing to relate to except for an intimidating blue screen. The story isn't exactly enthralling, the visuals are un-inspiring, and while this is a milestone for the progress of SFX in movies, this one doesn't stand up well today. Remember it for its kitsch and clamor, but don't expect anything amazing.

B00006V9A0|4.0|Although all the songs on this album are good there are a few problems that should be mentioned. To start off with Nirvana's first single off their first album and one of there best songs 'Love Buzz' was not included it should have been the first track on this album. Also Negative Creep and the EP song 'Blew', both Nirvana classics from their first album should have been included. The song 'About A Girl' was not the only pop tune from their first album. The 1990 single 'Sliver' was a good choice aswell. Also the four hit singles from the 'Nevermind' album are obvious choices. Unfortunatly there are no songs representing the 1992 rareities album 'Incesticide', the song 'Aneurysm' has always been a fan favorite and always was a live favorite it would have done well to be included. The hit single 'Heart-Shaped Box' from 'In utero' was another obvious good choice. Unfortunatly the second hit from 'In Utero', 'All Apologies' was not included, instead the live unplugged version was used which was neither a hit or as good. Although the double A-side song to the 'All Apologies' single 'Rape Me' and the planned third single from 'In Utero' 'Pennyroyal Tea'  were both good choices. <br /> The songs chosen from Unplugged were also good choices. Although the unplugged version of 'About A Girl' which was actually a hit in europe was not included instead the original version was included which is fair enough. <br /> As for 'Been A Son' the b-side to the 'Blew EP', a better version can be found on the 'Incesticide' album and if they could include a b-side why not the a-side 'Blew'! <br /> The previously unreleased 'You Know You're Right' which although incomplete is a great song but it really should have gone at the end of the album as it was Nirvana's final song. <br />All the songs on this album are great but it lacks pace of many Nirvana songs which is one of the things that made them great. If the favorites 'Love Buzz' and 'Aneurysm' had been added the album would have been almost perfect, and how could they forget the Nirvana trade mark song 'Negative Creep'? <br />
B00005JMUA|5.0|Without the second part, the story stays in random pieces. <br />The first one find it's drama on this one. <br />Without the second half, one doesn't understand the fury going on in the first part. It's a must see!
B0000VD04M|4.0|Johnny Deep gave one of his best preformances in this hilarious and somewhat sad satire about a non-bankable second generation director. The remarkable thing about this movie is not just quick biopic about a person as said by his collegues, but Johnny Depp actually potrays perfectly the role of Ed Wood at play. How he spoke to actors, his craft, and every thing that shed a bit of light on what Ed Wood was thinking when directing his so-called 'masterpiece. I was easily ammused by the black-and white shot of the entire movie and how it gave that feel of Ed Wood's filmmaking era.<br /><br />The acting was top notch, both from Depp and supporting actor, Bill Murray. I wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made, but it is one of the best i've seen simply because it goes even deeper into Hollywood and exploits the glitz and glamour for what it is.<br /><br />This is a potrayal of the man who was actually dubbed Worst Dirctor. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it or rent it. If you like 'Ed Wood', then glance through 'Simone' starring Al Pachino as a failed filmmaker who creates a computerized actress that becomes a box-office smash.
B00004U2G4|5.0|`truth' is Jeff Beck's first solo album after leaving that great breeding ground of Rock guitarists, The Yardbirds, where he served after Eric Clapton left and before Jimmy Paige arrived. This is a true `solo' album in that Beck is forming no group out of his extraordinary collection of sidemen, including Rod Stewart doing vocals, Ron Wood on base, and Nicky Hopkins (a regular on Rolling Stones keyboards) on piano.<br /><br />The CD I have does not have an original date of release for the album, but I recall it was somewhere around 1969, which is when I bought the LP. It also happened to be the very first time I heard Rod Stewart. And, it was on the strength of these performances which prevented me from looking down my nose at his own solo albums when they became the darlings of the 1970s teeny-boppers.<br /><br />The very best thing I can say about this album is that I still listen to it 36 years after it was first released, and, I can remember how impressed I was when I first heard it. I can say that about maybe only a half dozen or so albums, most of which are a lot more famous than this release.<br /><br />I can remember being impressed from the very first cut, but the performance which really blew me away was the ensemble's rendition of George Gershwin's `Ol' Man River' from the Broadway show `Riverboat'. The impression is based less on the fact that a rock band would do this number than the fact that it is was so memorably done by Paul Robeson when the play first hit the stage. Stewart has done some nice performances in his career, but I will always remember this as his finest moment.<br /><br />Most of the other selections are just a little unusual for a former Yardbird. They are certainly a little different than Clapton's blues and Paige's heavy metal direction. The most interesting other selections are `Beck's Bolero' which was stolen the next year by King Crimson on `Lizard' and the opener on side 2, their version of the traditional `Greensleeves'.<br /><br />By today's standards, the length of the material may be a bit short, but this is a first rate `60's rock classic!<br /> <br />By today's standards, the length of the material may be a bit short, but this is a first rate `60's rock classic! <br />
B0000AMRJC|4.0|'Scarface' is admittedly a favorite to anybody who's into the triller/drama genre of the somewhat controversial 'pop-culture' Miami Vice style 80s. Scarface was funnier than in was a tragedy. I wouldn't exagurrate and call it the greatest movie of the 80s or of the century or of the millienia... you know where i'm going with this. Pachino's role as Tony Montana is what makes this movie \\"GREAT TO WATCH\\" not \\"THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME\\". There were scenes like the one in the shower in the motel room where the Columbians tore apart one of Pachino's allies head off using a chiansaw and that was horrific. This movie also circles heavily around drugs, power and greed, and that was what it was like in the 80s, a cesspool of no names trying to come up in the world by any means nessessary, and one of them was the so called \\"Political Refugee\\" Tony Montana.<br /><br />This was a fascinating movie to watch, although i watched it in the 80s, the review comes back to it as i watched it for the 2nd time. I like Scarface, and it was fresh in it's time. Although the films of the world has changed into a much lighter approach then it did in the 80s, Scarface is highly considered as one of the finest piece of films made. Corruption, drugs and money, potrayed perfectly by the help of Oliver Stone's screenplay, Brian De Palma's directing and Pachino's Oscar-Material acting.<br /><br />Overall, this movie provided some of the most horrific and memroble scenes, as well as changing the landscape of the movie business, which heavily focused on drugs and corruption after Scarface's controversial debut. A fine film and a great addition to any DVD collection, buy this.
B00009NH5W|5.0|When TTD first released this CD in 2001, it was a German import and listed under D'arby's new name \\"Sananda Maitreya\\".  Took a while to track it down.  Interesting that it is available in the US under his more common name.  This is a better copy with additional tracks.  This is a killer CD.
B00004XPPB|4.0|Just kidding, that aside, i watched this simply because of the fact that it is based on a true story. It's not more of 'a' true story but the most infamous story in American history. I noticed that 'true stories' that are diverted into films always become some of the most epic films ever seen, and sometimes it can be embarassing i.e Ed Wood and Pollock. Donnie Brasco, maybe one of the most famed and celebrated films of the late 90s was also the most brilliantly acted from the entire cast. From extras to supporting roles such as the fantastic Michael Madsen and his rendition of Sonny Black.<br /><br />The story is fast paced, often changing the relationship between characters and bringing out the actors out of their shells to purly shine. This is not a big review because there's not much to say but that this is truly fine work and one of the most unforgettable and controversial stories in the United States.
B0000004V2|5.0|Basicamente creo que los STONE ROSES, es lo mejor que pudo ocurrir a finales de los 80's, prcticamente ya iniciando los 90's, este album es perfectamente audible en su totalidad...y aunque no creo que exista un \\"re-encuentro\\" ya que Ian Brown sigue muy fuerte como solista y muy enfocado a su trabajo - que por cierto excelente rola con Noel Gallaher (Oasis) \\"Keep what ya got\\" - pero el trabajo ya realizado es de muy buena calidad y que ha dejado huella en otras bandas que han sido influenciadas x sus sonidos e inclusive en sus letras  <br /> <br />Aqu les dejo a los hispano-parlantes (hasta el mismo Ian, tiene una rola en espaol) para que consideren este CD (en 5 aos desconozco si se utilizara el mismo formato) para su coleccin melmana. <br /> <br />Saludos otra vez desde Zapopan, Jal.

6304711891|2.0|To be honest, looking back at this 90s action/thriller, i come to think that Hollywood was easily ammused with fireworks, bombs and guns in a storyline. Add some big names into the mix and an acclaimed director and guess what, the movie fails. The Rock, plainly based on the world's fate or San Francsico for that matter, it just about a bunch of guys trying to evade the green rocks from exploding and causing mass chaos and nucleur reactivity.<br /><br />I admire Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery because their acting can sometimes be of higher class (Adaptation, From Russia with Love), but acting in a thriller with the worst storyline of the 90s changed my mind of watching big names in summer action blockbusters. If you like the 'bangs' and have no moral taste in movies, than surely this is for you. I give it two stars for the mild action sequences provided, not even by the actors but by the stuntmen, without whom this film would be impossible.
B000A59PMO|5.0|\\"Veronica Mars\\" is one of those rare tv shows that one the outside seem like a wannabe, but when you watch it, it only takes a few minutes before it gets its hooks into you and doesn't let you go; it just straps you in for one hell of a ride.  Ever since the demise of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\" I have been searching the air waves for a worthy replacement with \\"Gilmore Girls\\" becoming the only option.  But then last September I read a newspaper article titled \\"Buffy the next generation\\" and out of pure curiosity I tuned into an MTV rerun of the pilot. <br /> <br />Within minutes I was hooked, but I didn't know why.  The show looked like the OC, talked like Buffy, acted like Gilmore Girls, and felt like nothing I have ever seen.  I couldn't quite put my finger on it but the show kept bringing me back for more.  Finally I realized that there where two reasons.  The first was the incredible writting.  No show in the annals of history was written like \\"buffy the vampire slayer\\" but Veronica Mars is giving her a run for her money.  The creators happen to fill the seasons full of episodes that although having no pure focus on the season-long plot, but they helped the season arc along its merry way every single week (that takes alot of planning and pathents) and instead of felling rushed like \\"angel\\" or being a letdown like \\"x-files\\" it leads to a sacisfactory ending.  The second reason this show is so likable is the incredible Kristine Bell.  There is no comment to praisworthy not to fit ms. bell, she has the looks of sarah michelle gellar (without the nasty aura), she has the vocabulary of Lauren Grahm, the charm of alyson hannigan, and the innocence of Dakota Flanning.  It will be a downright shame is the Emmys don't recongize her this Thursday was a nomination. <br /> <br />I've gone on about how awesome the show is, yet I havn't really told you what it is about.  The show is about Veronica Mars, a 17-year-old girl thats live in the town of Neptune, California (a San Diego Suburb where either your parents makes millions of dollars a year or works for the parents that makes millions of dollars a year) and has a part-time job as the secretary or her father's detective agency, but most the time she is doing the detiving.  The main plot that takes the entire season to play out is how a few months ago her best friend was murdered and at the time her dad was the sheriff and he blamed the girls parents which caused the town to out him of the sheriff position and in turned made Veronica go from Popular to geek.  Durring the season Veronica puts the clues together to who married her friend, and how it was covered up. <br /> <br />There is noway that a person can fit enough good things about this show in one review... And there are no negitive comments that i can think of.  If you are a fan of quality television this is the show for you!  The second season premieres on UPN in september so you might want to tivo those episodes and watch them after this amazing box set which includes deleted scenes, directors cut of the pilot, and Bloopers.... Pick it up you won't be disapointed!
B00005JLD4|3.0|We've been trying to see this film for a while now, after having missed it in the theater. I was interested because it had a score by Peter Gabriel, who has great taste for movies with which to lend his efforts (e.g., Birdy, The Last Tempation of Christ). It also had Kenneth Branagh in it, whom I don't follow as much as I used to given his recent track record, but when he's good, he's very good. And in this movie, playing the part of Mr. Neville, the \\"Aborigine Protector\\" of Australia for 25 years, he shines. There's nothing more unctuous than a man who thinks he is doing the right and noble thing, which we can view in hindsight as a truly horrible policy.<br /><br />The story is set in 1931 during the Australian relocation of half-caste children to an orphanage that tried to instill white culture and identity on them. The three girls that the story follows are taken from their home and transported to the Moore House 1200 miles away, then run away to make their way back home by walking, mostly using the rabbit-proof fence as a guide. The director doesn't attempt to explain much beyond the initial subtitles that set the time and scene; in fact, in some scenes, his \\"show\\" has to be interpreted, albeit it is usually obvious enough (such as the white man visiting the half-caste cleaning woman on his farm in the middle of the night). Branagh's Neville is a central focus, ostensibly the villain of the movie, but he comes across as simply a bureaucrat with no empathy for the aborigines that he is supposed to be the protector of. The scene in which he explains his goal of breeding the color out of the half-castes makes clear that his protectorship was more oriented to the whites than the aborigines.<br /><br />One finishes the movie simply shaking your head in disbelief. It's hard to conceive walking 1200 miles (or more, given the wrong turns and need to avoid capture) across the Australian outback without dying of hunger or thirst or simply getting lost. And it's hard to believe in a people that would engage in such practice of separating mother from child, as recently as 1970. As Americans we can't be too critical of the Australians, however, because our actions with our own indigenous people were hardly noble or just and just occured a few decades before the Austrialian debacle.<br /><br />I enjoyed Rabbit-Proof Fence, although I'm not sure I'd recommend it to just anyone. It's pleasantly short, which is good, because there wasn't any need for it to be longer given the story, but also the brevity helps the film make its point without belaboring it.to believe in a people that would engage in such practice of separating mother from child, as recently as 1970.

B000002IG4|4.0|Another Genesis album, Abacab, was followed a year later by another Phil Collins solo album.  Hello, I Must Be Going was a clear indication of the Earth, Wind, & Fire type soul-pop that would yield the Grammy-winning No Jacket Required.  For the most part, gone were the \\"weird\\" songs like \\"In The Air Tonight\\" or the cover of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" His note-for-note cover of the Supremes' \\"You Can't Hurry Love,\\" which went to #10, is ample evidence of the pop/soul direction that would hit pay dirt later on.  It's still infectious and has its place in the 80's, a decade and a half before the original hit #1.<br /><br />The closest thing to \\"In The Air Tonight,\\" with the airy synths, is \\"Thru These Walls,\\" of how loneliness feeds upon the need to listen with a glass to the wall or stare out at the window at goings on, where a genuine need to touch someone isn't an option in the cold world.  Next up is the disgust and apathy of being ridiculed and having one's name dragged in the dirt of \\"I Don't Care Anymore,\\" which made it to #39.  However, there was none of the haunting eeriness which made \\"Air\\" a hit.  The slow \\"Do You Know Do You Care\\" has a droning synth and guitars, with Collins' vocals overlaid on that airy soundscape.  It sounds more like later day Genesis, come to think of it.<br /><br />The third single, the upbeat \\"I Cannot Believe It's True,\\" only made it to #79 despite the snazzy horns.  This is puzzling given how similar-sounding singles by him shot to the Top Ten in later years.  The Phenix Horns, his brass band, gives this song, and others like \\"It Don't Matter To Me\\" quite the kick.<br /><br />Two piano ballads are \\"Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away,\\" which gains a bit of momentum with his steady drumming, the strings matching the pounded piano chords, and the sad but tender \\"Why Can't It Wait Till Morning,\\" which is Phil on piano, the strings, and nothing else.  Another singleworthy song and one of my favourites here.<br /><br />Collins was also at the producer's helm this time, with assistance from Hugh Padgham, the brains behind Face Value and the Police's Synchronicity, and would continue with him in his Grammy-winning triumph.  And Daryl Steurmer, whose snarling guitar would be most noticeable in \\"Don't Lose My Number,\\" has guitar chores here.<br /><br />Whereas Face Value showed many sides of Collins, this is basically a prelude to the hit that No Jacket Required would become.  Maybe call this No Vest Required?  Yet one can't help but think that Collins' solo success also fed upon the success of his group.  Following this, Genesis would gain their first Top Ten hit with \\"That's All,\\" and during that time, Collins would pave the way to superstardom with a few non-album hits and some big events.  So, goodbye, I must be going.with assistance from Hugh Padgham, the brains behind Face Value and the Police's Synchronicity, and would continue with him in his Grammy-winning triumph.

B000002I8D|5.0|With the release of Genesis's Duke album, which featured \\"Misunderstanding,\\" it was clear that the group was approaching the mainstream more and more.  The next step would be Abacab, but before that, lead singer and drummer Phil Collins would release his first solo album, Face Value, an album of longing that also details the emotional wasteland of a sundered relationship.  As if to test the waters, he did a more pop updating of \\"Behind The Lines,\\" originally on Duke, with speeded up vocals and a snazzy brass section (as opposed to the soundscape of Tony Banks' keyboards, such as the instrumental opening) that would become a calling card on his subsequent solo albums.<br /><br />Two singles from that album both reached #19 on the charts.  The first one was the upbeat \\"I Missed Again,\\" highlighted by a strong brass section.  The other, \\"In The Air Tonight,\\" a UK #2, is one of Collins' signature tunes, with its moody and atmospheric keyboards highlighted by Collins' haunting vocals, and the snarl of Daryl Steurmer's guitar.  The chorus itself has an eerie echoing effect that matches the minimalist sound, as does the electronic gimmickery of the vocals.  The song and sound then burst to a crescendo when Collins lets loose with the drums through the rest of the song.<br /><br />There are other surprises present, such as the instrumental \\"Droned,\\" which begins with a slow piano and violins, an airy soundscape, before going full throttle with an uptempo conga and piano section, the violin turning more folky, and Collins' vocalizing proving that Peter Gabriel doesn't have the monopoly on droning vocals.  That yields to \\"Hand In Hand,\\" beginning as a sci-fi Giorgio Moroder-type instrumental (think Metropolis soundtrack) that features the Children from the Church of LA as a choir, before launching into an uptempo brass and piano soul number.  \\"I'm Not Moving\\" is the closest thing to disco Collins would do until \\"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven\\" nearly a decade later,<br /><br />One of the other highlights is the piano and strings of the post-breakup tune \\"You Know What I Mean,\\" the emotional devastation which can be felt:  \\"leave me alone with my heart/I'm putting the pieces back together again/just leave me alone with my dreams/I can do without you...\\"  \\"If Leaving Me Is Easy,\\" with its sad sax, is another melancholy song along the same vein, but this time through the presence of old letters and the false front one put with friends.  Collins' pain is felt through the strained vocals, as he sagely sings the refrain in an eerie falsetto, \\"if leaving me is easy, going back is harder.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Roof Is Leaking\\" details the hardships of a rural family living in poverty, but with the hope of the coming spring.

038073186X|5.0|This kept me up at night reading because it was such a twisted and gripping psychological thriller.  When I finally finished it, I had to read a Dave Barry humor book to shut my mind down so that I could get some rest!  This is a complete masterpiece, all coming together in the end for a biting twist that makes complete sense and leaves the reader feeling haunted.  Anything having to do with a psychiatric hospital of the 1950's is bound to be scary, but this goes beyond your wildest expectations.<br /><br />This is an intense read--Lehane had my heart rate up for the last 1/3 of the book.  The dream sequences were very vivid, and this was the first time that I really felt an author had actually captured the non-linearity of a dream in text form.<br /><br />On a side note, the name Shutter Island is fictional, but when I made my Mom read this, she said Lehane is describing Thompson's Island, off the coast of Boston.  She used to play in the abandoned forts there as a child.
B00029LNHS|2.0|My friend is way into the BEP's. He told me that their first album \\"Behind The Front\\" was the best, but I didn't really like it that much. Then he gave me \\"Bridging the Gap\\" and that was also, just average. Then he gave me \\"Elephunk\\", which is the worst one yet; except for the huge hit \\"Let's Get It Started\\". That song is probably the best song to have been made in the last 50 years. The original version, \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" is very derogetory and shameful. Making fun of the physically challenged is the lowest you can go. But I'll still give it 2 stars for \\"Let's Get It Started\\".
0393035158|5.0|I never thought I would live through times when the moderates would be part of the problem and not the solution.  I'd always suspected that the monotheists, regardless of persuasion and intensity, were breeding unhealthy mental states.  I'm now convinced.  This was a brilliant book; one that I will refer back to many times in the future.
B00000F1D3|5.0|Oh my god! I love this song \\"Believe\\"! I just ordered my copy for 1. At a price like that, it's hard to resist. \\"Believe\\" has the best bumpin house lyrics, with those smooth intoxicating lyrics from one of the most gifted song writers and lyricists of all time, Cher. I usually listen to this song on repeat while I'm cleaning my room. I just hate it when my little sister or my mom comes in my room while I'm cleaning, cuz sometimes they see things they don't want to see. Even though I constantly tell them not to disturb me while I'm cleaning my room!
B00025ETIW|5.0|Look, I am a born and bred metalhead. This is the kind of stuff that I should be bashing, but in all honesty, MCR's latest is, by far, the best album of 2004. This is one of my new favorites, right next to Megadeth's Rust In Peace and Slayer's Reign In Blood, and no, I'm not joking. This album will blow your f*cking ears off of your head. This is the kind of brash honesty that is needed in today's Linkin-Park-Pro-Tooled world. I have never heard someone BLEED in the style the Gerard Way does. That goes for the whole band, too. I'm not sure what happened to these guys growing up, but they are SCARRED. If you have ever lost a loved one to death or another person, this album will help you. If you've had your proverbial second-wind blow you back onto your feet, this album will help you. This album fits all moods and is a great album to make out to! Buy this album or remain a close-minded stupidass. Peace out!
B0002KVUKM|2.0|I'm a Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and Horror nut. I love the genres ...as long as they're done right. And the only thing that I can see that was done \\"right\\" in this film was the CGI effects.<br /><br />Let's start with the plot:<br /><br />First, Van Helsing is no longer the lovable old guy who is constantly on the trail of Count Dracula. Here we have Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman, X-Men) as a kind of dark arch-angel who works for a secret society in the Catholic Church who's charge is to protect society from abominations (i.e., Mr. Hyde, Ogres, etc.), thus helping Christianity and goodness flourish across the planet.<br /><br />About 15 minutes into the film, we finally see Van Helsing being assigned to the Dracula legend in Transylvania. He has to save a young woman (Kate Beckinsale) from the dastardly clutches of the blood sucking fiend. If he doesn't, doom will encompass the countryside.<br /><br />Here's how the rest of the film goes: Having long dialogue with vampires before battling them ...and winning. Having long dialogue with vampires before battling them ...and losing. Having long dialogue with vampires before battling them ...and winning.<br /><br />The plot --- if there is one --- is basically to kill Count Dracula. But there are so many other things going on (the struggle of Frankenstein to \\"exist\\" --- which I thought was the best side story of the entire film ---, the development of baby-vampires --- don't ask ---, and a slew of other terrible ideas) that I felt completely and utterly wasted as a movie viewer.<br /><br />Other problems:<br /><br />Umm, this is supposed to be about saving people from Dracula and saving Christianity, right? So what was with the burning funeral pyre at the end of the movie (isn't that a Pagan thing?)<br /><br />The film starts off in black-and-white in the late 1800's, giving the viewer the understanding that the action during this time took place long ago. And then we jump ahead an entire ...YEAR! and switch to color. Wow. That was lame.<br /><br />I can't begin to tell you how horrible this film was. There's more horrors to be told, but I have to head to the bathroom. I feel ...oh no! ...GHACKKK!color. Wow. That was lame.  <br /> <br />I can't begin to tell you how horrible this film was. There's more horrors to be told, but I have to head to the bathroom. I feel ...oh no! ...GHACKKK!
B0007PAMBK|4.0|I first saw \\"Carnival of Souls\\" on the late-night show of I forgot which Australian channel. Black and white, as the original. We didn't have colour TV back then (it must have been 1969). <br /> <br />Wow! Eerie, haunting, and the sound track disturbing, but spot on, jarring, but rightly so, almost as jarring as Kurt Weil's \\"Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny\\", or Shostakovich's \\"Charge of the Teutonic Knights\\" in Eisenstein's \\"Alexandr Nevski\\". Did I write \\"almost as jarring\\"? Quite as jarring. <br /> <br />What is it about? A woman who drives off a bridge, into the river below, and is rescued.  <br /> <br />Now, spoiler ahead.... <br /> <br /> <br />Scroll down <br /> <br /> <br />and down... <br /> <br /> <br />and down... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Do you really want to know? <br /> <br /> <br />It is still time... <br /> <br /> <br />All right, here it is... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />She has not been rescued, she has died, but she does not know it. The whole film is about how she slowly fades away from the world of the living, until she  ends up in the carnival of souls  (a carousel) where she is torn apart by the dead. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />No horror, no special effects, only subdued terror. <br /> <br /> <br />I was so happy when I found this DVD in some shop, almost 30 years later, going for a song  ($10 or so). If you do happen across it, do not hesitate one moment.
0380789019|5.0|This book has to be one of my all time favorites. Unlike most fantasy writers, Gaiman puts his stories in familiar real life settings, which works to perfection in Neverwhere. The narratives are so good I feel that I was right there with the characters at every twist and turn of their adventures through another side of London. It is not a big book but packed with action and suspense. At the end, I have experienced so much with the main characters that it is sad to finally say goodbye.<br /><br />I would also recommend another book by Gaiman, American Gods.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|Well, I gave it a month of listening to get it into my soul, and I'm happy to say that this new album from JUDAS PRIEST is up there with their best work.  I have been a fan of them from back when \\"Stained Class\\" was new. So, I am partial to that album as being their best work. But, their 1982 release, \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" is right there in my book as being either their top album or 2nd just after 'Stained Class\\". This new one, \\"Angel of Retribution\\" is right there at the top amongst their best. There is not one lame song on this album. The first track, 'Judas is Rising' makes your heart scream for what \\"Metal\\" is all about.. it just plain kick-ass. The following songs, 'Deal With the Devil' & 'Revolution' also kick major ass. Track 4, 'Worth Fighting For' is a more slow tempo type of 'ballad'... still, a damned good rock song and should be their next big radio air-play song!  Next up... 'Demonizer', whew!   Awesome song!  'Wheels of Fire' doesn't let you rest. 'Angel' is another slow-paced song that is simply awesome. 'Hellrider' is next and absolutley kicks-ass, and was great live on this year's tour!  'Eulogy' is a very slow tempo track that has an ominous feel about it, with a reference to 'Stained Class'.  The last track on the album is the 13+ minute epic 'Loch Ness'...  I am just speachless.... an awesome awesome album from the start to finish.  A work of art from JUDAS PRIEST !!!!!!
B0006L16N8|2.0|I am sorry to say this because I like Coldplays earlier work.  Unforutnatly this is exactly what X&Y is -- a cold replay of their earlier work. Based on this album, the Band has not grown in terms of their music or the issues they deal with.<br /><br />I bought this album on the advice of a friend who said that they loved the band and this was the best yet.  I guess they did love the band as they were -- because this is what we are getting.  Unfortunatly, I was hoping to find a band that would grow and change as I have.<br /><br />If you want more of Parachutes and Rush of Blood, then go for it and revel.  If you are looking for something more, then take a pass on this one.
B0000931QA|5.0|I'll make this review quick....  This is the greatest album of all-time!  That goes for all bands, musicians, singers and Frank Sinatra fans out there! Great songs, great concept, and one of the greatest singers ever! It makes you wonder...\\"Who did it?\\"  \\"Do you remember now...?\\" The greatest album of all-time!!
B000089RVX|1.0|15 minutes is up, Evanescence we'll see you on vh1's where are they now in about 10 years. If you like this you have no taste. This is mainstream and this fails. Amy Lee is cocky and arrogant, she trys to act underground and angsty but she has more money than I can imagine. Only one kind of girl looks up to somebody as pathetic as her. The cliche \\"goth\\" girls ranging 12-17 because this kind of music can totally relate to the pain of growing up in suburban america, don't forget to keep cutting yourselves to relieve all your mental anguish, ladies! Look at rock these days, now look at rock a decade ago. The difference is disgusting, while mtv had some credability left then, it is all but gone now. Go ahead, disagree with me, I could care less. Listen to some real music and then we can talk. Avoid this like the plague.

B000002A3T|4.0|My initial concern before listening to The Division Bell was \\"is this gonna be another Momentary Lapse Of Reason?\\" I wasn't particularily a huge fan of that album, not just because of Roger Waters' non-involvement (of course, I wouldn't have complained if he WAS involved), but also because Rick Wright & Nick Mason's roles were minimal at best...not to mention, Momentary's production was disappointing as well IMO.     However, The Division Bell surpassed my expectations. Wright & Mason were more involved this time (Wright getting songwriting credit on FIVE tracks), and as a result it just has a much \\"warmer\\" sound than Momentary, feeling much more convincing as a \\"band\\" effort again. \\"Poles Apart\\" and \\"High Hopes\\" are worthy enough to belong on any Floyd compilation, and songs like \\"Keep Talking\\" & \\"What Do You Want From Me\\" occasionally call back to the '75-'77 era, the former featuring some sinister guitar work by David Gilmour reminiscent of \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\". \\"Wearing The Inside Out\\" is a nice treat, featuring a rare lead vocal by Wright.    My only negatives are 1)the lyrical depth, while ambitious, just doesn't hit it out of the park like Waters did, and 2)the song \\"Coming Back To Life\\" sounds less like Pink Floyd and more like a lost Tom Cochrane outtake...and lost is where it belongs.     Overall, while not on the same pedestal as _______(insert favorite Floyd albums), The Division Bell is worthy enough to wear the Pink Floyd banner, and a huge leap forward from A Momentary Lapse Of Reason. Not a bad note to go out on...
B0000026T4|4.0|... I started to like Trash. <br /> <br />It was the backup vocals that didn't set in well at first. Then, it was the whole fact that it was Cooper from the 80's, and this was my first introduction to Cooper in the 80's.  <br />As I started listening to more of his albums, I really began to enjoy this one. Plus, \\"Trashes the World\\" is one of my favorite live performances. A must.  <br /> <br />I wouldn't recommend starting out on this album if you're just getting into Cooper. Start with \\"Love it To Death\\" or \\"Killer\\". But if you're really in it for the raw, original Cooper, go for \\"Freak Out\\", the little gem that I love. <br /> <br />\\"This Maniac's In Love With You\\" is by far my favorite track. <br />\\"I'm Your Gun\\" comes second. <br />And then of course, \\"Poison\\". <br /> <br />Not a bad effort. With a few flaws, you can't go wrong.  <br />Go pick it up. <br /> <br />
B000002C1W|3.0|Whenever I listen to A Momentary Lapse Of Reason (AMLOR), I'm never quite as fulfilled as I am with Pink Floyd's other albums. While the songs themselves are strong, it doesn't quite have that \\"finished product\\" sound IMO. Much of it feels like some slightly fleshed-out demos for a David Gilmour solo album, and the production is nightmarish by Pink Floyd standards.     Now, I'm not being purposely critical of this album due to the absence of Roger Waters, proof being I DO happen to enjoy The Division Bell, thanks very much. But not-so-coincidentally, The Division Bell includes more involvement by Rick Wright & Nick Mason, whom for all intents & purposes are AWOL from AMLOR...so when THREE founding members aren't writing or (barely) contributing on what's supposed to be a Pink Floyd project, the result becomes less inspiring and more contrived & one-dimensional.     If Wright and Mason were more involved & brought something to the table for AMLOR, I woulda been intrigued to hear the results. But as it is, I probably woulda given this 4 stars had this been a Gilmour release, but only a \\"soft\\" 3 stars as a Floyd album....

0812550757|5.0|Orson Scott Card's Speaker for the Dead is the wonderfully well written sequal to Ender's Game.  The book takes place approximately 3,000 years after Ender's Game but, since he has spent most of his life in near lightspeed flight hopping from planet to planet, Ender (who now uses his real name Andrew) and Valentine have only aged 25 years.  Andrew now receives another call for a Speaker for the Dead from a colony 22 lightyears away but, instead of asking his sister Valentine to come with him he goes alone.  When he arives at the colony 14 days later (but 22 years for the colony) he finds out that not only was the call for a speaker illegally cancelled, but that the sweet young girl who called him has turned into a bitter harsh women and has several troubled children of her own now.  Andrew must now unravel the truth.<br /><br />The Ender series starts out exciting and adventurous, but starting with this book (and the next two at least) are quite sad.  Although set during the space age, Card deals with so much human emotion it is hard to really enjoy your time spent reading.  I kind of wish I'd stopped at Ender's Game rather than see what happens.  You'll have to decide for yourself.
B00003CXBK|5.0|i dont know why everyone is recomending this movie to older audiences because of violence, or \\"deep plot\\". there is not that much violence in this movie, and the plot is easy to follow. I watched this movie in 4th grade and thought it was great. the character development is fantastic and the animals are suposed to be gods, not just animals (to those who think this is an environmentalist movie). this was an excelent movie from a great japanese writer.
B000002U9L|5.0|This particular soundtrack benefits two kinds of people, 1) David Bowie fans, and 2) Labyrinth fans. If you subscribe to fanships under both categories, like myself, then it's all the more bang for your buck. First, let's talk Bowie. David Bowie is one of those individuals in life who has been given the blessed talent to express thoughts, feelings, and terms of reality in such a way that clearly defines a new shade of color in the spectrum of music. Obviously, these songs can only achieve so much depth for a movie whose cast largely consists of puppets - that it is to say, this soundtrack should not be perceived as a true representation of David Bowie's work in general. Regardless, Bowie ROCKS where ROCK is needed, and romances for that matter, referring to, of course, 'As the World Falls Down'. For those people who loved the movie, and likely have the songs committed to memory anyway, having the soundtrack at hand allows you to slip into that world of musical mayhem without the aid of the television. One last thing, 'Chilly Down' (not sung by Bowie) is a little wierd but go with it, you might the like the song, and does make sense in the context of the movie - sort of.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Kid, I suggest you start taking lessons on what great films are all about.  This is a great film under the cliches of modern films about this subject matter.  What this movie excells in is its suspense and control over the audience.  Spielberg insisted that the shark not be seen for the first hour because he knew that the audience reaction would be that much greater when the shark finally is seen.  It works very well and nobody can deny that it scared them when they first saw it, unless they saw \\"Open Water\\" or \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" first.  This movie can also be called the first summer blockbuster.  It was released during the summer in a time when it was thought that releasing a movie over the summer was not a good move, as people supposedly didn't go to movies during the summer.  It became the most successful movie of all time for good reason.  It gave audiences what they were looking for:  a good scare.  Today, it still has the ability to do that.  All aspects are great.  The acting from the supposed non-stars is terrific, the music has become classic, and the editing won an Oscar.  If you're looking for a great, scary movie that will entertain as much as it scares, this is a good one.  Concerning the DVD:  I'll probably buy the 30th anniversary edition, even though I already own the 25th anniversary edition.  I think it's worth it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This isn't the first time Green Day has blown the world with their music. The first time wasn't expected at all, a sher accident with there thrid album \\"Dookie\\", with songs like Longview and Basket Case that got the name GD known around the world. Since then, GD had come out with four other albums (\\"Insomniac\\" \\"Nimrod\\" \\"Warning\\" and \\"Shenanigans\\"). Their other albums didn't hold up in the market as well as Dookie had, not until American Idiot hit shelves in September 2004 (ten years after Dookie).  I myslef had liked GD ever since I had first learned of them, but one of my friends dosen't like GD at all (because of the song American Idiot. Which he has downloaded on his computer and I've seen him listening to it while I was wathcing T.V., so I'm confused there), so I myslef said I didn't like GD for awhile (big mistake, I could kick the s**t out of me for ever saying it). Then in April, after hearing Holiday on the radio, I was in a borders and just didn't care about what my friend thought of GD, so I bought \\"American Idiot\\". I was BLOWN away by this album. From the first second of American Idiot, all the way to the end of WhatsHerName, I instally fell in love with this album.  It truly doed show how GD has matured from thir very first album \\"1,039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\\" to their latest and greatest \\"Amercican Idiot\\". All the songs are to great for me to chose a favorite.  Who ever enjoyes music will love \\"American Idiot\\" for what it is... Music. It also has alot of messages within it's lyrics. Even though some of the messages you might not agree with, it is still an awsome for it's musical input. To all those who hate this Album or just GD in General, I feel sorry for you. Yet it is your own opinion and your own opinion is your best, I still extremly disagree with you.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I may be prejudice, but I love EVERYTHING about the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy.  This CD of the soundtrack is no exception.  Howard Shore's music is so evocative of the action in the films that I can relive the action just by listening to it.  And the vocal piece which won the Academy Award is as deserving as all of the other 10 awards the movie won (and we all know the clean sweep was for the mamouth effort of the entire series and not just for ROTK, for heaven's sake!)
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have heard in awhile.  It is unique and full of great songs.   <br /> <br />I'll leave it at that, because many other reviewers on here have done a great job of writing about it.  The only thing I have to add is that at times the music sounds like it has a dash of the composer Philip Glass in it.  Not too much Glass, but just enough. <br /> <br />Can't wait to hear the Texas album, however I might be an old man by then.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I don't just hand out five-star ratings easily.  As a fan of 70's and 80's metal I have difficulty with most albums released after 1990.  This one, however, is really that good.  I didn't think that there would be another five star performance for new music other than the Scorpions Unbreakable release early in 2005.  After sampling this one and then buying it I am most impressed.  This is Maiden's best CD to me, besides their Greatest Hits, Ed Hunter, which features no songs from this CD (having come out in 1999).   <br />At first I questioned the lyrics a bit on this.  They seemed a bit nebulous at times and almost as though they might belong with a movie soundtrack of some confusing sci/fi flic.  But in hearing and reading them again, they are about all you would expect from Iron Maiden.  a bit dark and helpless, but still relating well to the human condition at times.   <br />The choruses and overall melodies are superb.  A bit lacking in power chords I find, though, but the leads are great.  No song quite measures up to the song \\"Hallowed be thy Name\\", which is Maiden't best song in my view, but a few come close.  The power chords could have used some nice chunky palm mutes at times but this CD doesn't deliver that.  But the good news is almost every song is over six minutes, so you know you won't be disappointed with a good song that ends too quickly.  Three guitar players, though?  Don't understand that one, but whatever.   <br />Here are the standouts:  Wicker Man, Brave New World, Blood Brothers, Dream in Mirrors, Out of the Silent Planet, Thin Line Between Love and Hate.  Some other reviewers would be inclined to pick other songs.  The verdict is this CD is excellent.  Could have even been better with some chunky palm mutes.  Still great.  As they say:  \\"Up the Irons\\"!  Again, we should be pleased that guys like Dio, Maiden and the Scorps are still putting out good CD's like this in a time of appauling rock and popular music.
B00002DE2L|5.0|The romantic purists that don't like this recording give the impression that Sophie steals all of the original intentions that Vivaldi had when he wrote this music. I firmly believe that nothing could be further from the truth. Her liberal dashing of \\"musical hot sauce\\" throughout the piece truly breathes new life into what most people consider a worn out ol' faithful. As others have said in this forum, this recording takes background music, and makes it a masterpiece to listen to, not just hear.  <br /> <br />Of the several recordings that I have of this piece, this is the one that I choose to play most often; not just because I love The Four Seasons, but because I really enjoy this rendition. <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is an excellent CD. Listening to this reminds me of Yes during their peak, particularly Relayer period. Very fast, high energy playing, sudden changes in dynamics, frantic and chaotic, yet still melodic, and high register and very powerful vocals with good harmonization. There is also quite a bit of the spacy element here, as the band experiments with soundscapes and sound effects. One reviewer said it was too excessive, I on the contrary feel it was used exceptionally well. The Miranda song particularly uses it effectively. There are many styles of music incorporated here. <br /> <br />The album starts out softly with a melodic acoustic movement called Sarcophagi. It's very reminiscent of Led Zeppelin's Battle of Evermore or Yes's And You And I. But one minute into the first song, the next section, Umbilical Symbols, bursts in loud fast and furious. Not since Yes's Relayer have I heard such controlled chaos, crazy tempos, and busy frantic instruments. The vocals on top hold it all together, and the harmony during the chorus is both beautiful and powerful. This chorus becomes the theme for the entire album, and is actually reprised at the end of album before going back into Sarcophagi. <br /> <br />But I am getting ahead of myself. Once the first epic ends it quiets down again, and we get some sounds. The second song, The Widow, is the most radio friendly of the songs, as I've heard it before on the radio. A good catchy song that quickly goes back to its progressive roots with some spacy keyboard sounds. L'Via is a spanish song, that is both fast and loud, and soft and peaceful. It moves back and forth between these moods, with a slow latin dance number serving as the soft section. It eventually ends with this section, and soon goes into what I think is the best song on the album, the Miranda epic. <br /> <br />This is where it starts to get confusing. There are 12 tracks on this cd, yet there are only 5 songs listed on the back album cover (with no track numbers associated with them). I assumed that the last two songs were broken up into their movement sections, but upon reading the lyrics, I noticed that this was not the case. Indeed, track 4 is Miranda in its entirety, and the rest of the tracks are the Cassandra song. Still, that doesn't account for the 3 extra tracks. To make things more confusing there is a sixth three part song listed on the inside of the cd called 'Frances the Mute', with lyrics written that aren't heard on the album (I may have to listen more closely again to see if I can hear them). I later assumed that this song occurs somewhere in 'Cassandra'. I deduced, by reading the lyrics, that Frances the Mute actually occurs after 'Multiple Spouse Wounds' Section but before the 'Sarcophagi' reprise, which accounts for the three extra tracks. But it still doesn't explain the missing lyrics. Perhaps someone more in the know can explain this track discrepency. Nevertheless, Both these epics are incredible, although I felt 'Cassandra' went on a bit longer than it needed to. <br /> <br />The fact that this album was successful makes me very happy. With bands like Radiohead and Tool growing in success, and bands like Mars Volta up and coming, there is hope for progressive rock yet.
B0007XT7V8|3.0|This CD is pretty good even though it could've been better. Most of the songs have good lyrics, but you can almost hear the same melody over and over again which may give it somewhat a boring tune.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|You gotta hand it to 'em, System of a Down are great, they've always been great, and will continue to be great forever. This is but a taste of what they really are: Fun, creative and wild. The only thing wrong with this CD is that it's too short. Other than that, though, you'll be getting you're money's worth.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like most other fans, I didn't get to see Firefly when it first aired, but later picked it up on DVD. I have been a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel for awhile, and  when I saw that Joss Whedon had created another show, I couldn't wait to see it. And I was completely hooked with this amazing show  only 10 minutes into the first episode. It's really that good. Now every night my family all sits down together and watches an epsiode. I also have been having my friends over to see this wonderful show. Because of that I have seen every episode many many times, but they never get boring. Firefly is easy to understand if you know that it takes place 500 years in the future, all the natural resources on Earth have been used up, and people have created planets with science (not magic) that can support life. It's also helpful if you know that the U.S. and China were the last two super powers on Earth, so everyone speaks both languages.  From romance to action and from drama to comedy, this show has eveything. You will especially enjoy Firefly if you're a fan of science fiction or westerns; but even if your not, this show is worth looking into. Firefly is truly TV at its best and I hope there will be more seasons of the show after the three Firefly movies Joss is planning to have. Hope to see you all at Serenity (the 1st movie) on Sep. 30!
B0000027FQ|4.0|I give it four stars only because it does not contain the songs \\"Head Over Heels\\", \\"Burning\\" and \\"Neon Nights\\" which appear on the european 2-disc set. But other then that, this is great. <br /> <br />One of the only live albums i listened to on a daily basis, this is how metal should sound live. Udo is simply awesome here, his razor shreiks and yells were probably the roughest vocals you could get in the age before extreme metal (i.e. Thrash, Death, ect). All of the songs are played with amazing energy, these guys were definatly NOT lazy, and did not rest on the laurals of the studio counterparts of these songs unlike what mopst bands did with live records (check out the Scorpions \\"World Wide Live\\" album to see what i mean about inferior live songs), in fact these guys actually made their live songs sound better!  <br /> <br />The Wolf Hoffmann solo in the middle is breathtaking, along with Vitto Bratta, prehaps the most underrated guitarist alive, now he's a world famous photographer, go figure. <br /> <br />If you have never heard of this band, i would say start with this platter, it gives you the best songs from their four best albums played live. German rock at its finest.
B0009KQOMO|5.0|Great Movie If Bruce Willis was not in this movie and BILLY BOB THORTON it would of been a complete waste of time. I am not here to tell you about the DVD so go out and buy it and see for yourself.  <br />
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Which is a good thing.  The best thing about Dream Theater is their ability to reinvent themselves almost every album.  If you want the same sound song after song, album after album, then there's a great little band for you called AC/DC.  They rock, and you know exactly what every album will sound like years in advance.  Remember why they are called prog rock... progessive. <br /> <br />That being said, this is a very solid offering from Dream Theater.  Kicking it off right where Train left off, The Root of All Evil is awesome.  I can't remember a more catchy chorus or powerful intro.  About half the tracks are \\"filler,\\" and when I say filler, that's a good thing in reguards to dream theater.  Their \\"filler\\" songs are great songs, just when placed next to awesome songs, you tend to skip over them knowing what's next.  On their own, they're great. <br /> <br />Then there's the title track.  An awesome epic.  There's not much to be said for it that hasn't already been said better by previous reviews.  I have to say i'm humbled by the expertise and in-depth reviews that come before me.  That just shows the kind of fans Dream Theater attracts. <br /> <br />I feel this will end up being another Dream Theater classic that will stand the test of time.
B0008KLVCS|5.0|This is a great movie from beginning to end with a sursprise ending, but don't ask me what it is go out and buy it.
B000089CJI|1.0|Another reviewer had it right... This is 80's Nintendo <br />music with mediocre vocals. Just ashamed. Why do people <br />like such cheese? Don't people have any taste at all??
B0009K7RTI|2.0|This is possibly the worst made in film in America TODAY!!!!<br /><br />Do NOT Buy this, it has some highspots but overall it's Garbage!
B00097DX3U|4.0|Audioslave had proven to me that there was a connection and a complete understanding of each other's capability with their first album.  They meshed their two opposing styles together so well that it created a new, incredible, rock group nearly seamlessly.  Their new album confirms the fact that that movement was not simply lightening in a bottle.  This album contains the radio friendly singles and the power ballads that made the first album so successful and it flows beautifully from the first song to the final notes of the last.  It is an incredible CD which will raise the question, is Audioslave going to become one of the great bands of all time?
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Anthony Minghella directs this tale based on the best-selling book about wounded Civil War soldier Inman (Jude Law) making the long, treacherous journey to his home in Cold Mountain, N.C. Along the way, he thinks of his love, Ada (Nicole Kidman), who has fought for sanity and her father's farm's survival while Inman has been gone, even with a brave young drifter named Ruby (Renee Zellweger, in an Oscar-winning performance) there to lend a hand.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I love the songs from Chicago. In my opinion, these are the best you can find. the Original recording was British, and in my opinion, sounded odd in some places, like the Cell Block Tango (but still good!) <br /> <br />Catherine and Renee' have great voices, and make a great team. Who knew they could sing! I was blown away. The best song on this album is deffinately Cell block tango, but All that Jazz is amazing, aswell.  <br /> <br />As I said, I thought the movie was rather dull. It was very... classy. Classy in that old aged show-biz kind of way. Everyone was on stage, everyone looked glamorous, and everyone's voice was great. <br /> <br />And still, the movie didn't appeal to me. It seemed like everything happened too fast. She shot her lover, ended up in jail, and all that Jazz. Something just didn't seem to fit into place. <br /> <br />But the music makes up for it, nonetheless.
B00097A5I6|4.0|My orginal review of this CD gave it 1 star and I considered it complete rubbish, however after shelving it [I have been an Oasis fan since I first heard them in '94 must likely one of the first Americans on record; so I was very disappointed] I continued to catch myself humming some of the tunes, therefore I decide to have another go.  I now walk way really loving some of the songs and hating others, however the ones that I like are brilliant and better then 90% of the music coming out of American artists getting radio play!!!  My biggest problem that I have with Oasis today is that since Noel decided to share the writting of the songs this along with Heathen Chemistry seem to lack the flow that older Oasis CDs have, thus [at least for me] it takes a while to get use to the CDs.  Below are the songs that I think are the best:<br /><br />Turn up the Sun<br /><br />Love Like a Bomb<br /><br />The Importance of Being Idle<br /><br />Guess God Thinks I'm Able<br /><br />Part of the Queue<br /><br />Keep the Dream Alive<br /><br />Let There Be Love
B000001ZSE|4.0|Jean-Michel Jarre was an immediate superstar in Europe with the release of his debut album \\"Oxygene\\" in 1977. Since then he has made a lot of albums, some great, some not so.<br /><br />\\"Images\\" (20 tracks; 78 min., released in 1997) is what I would call a \\"politically correct\\" overview of his work. It covers all the phases of his work, and that is the drawback for me. Too many tracks of his later not-so-relevant CDs are included. There are only 6 tracks of his earliest, most famous and beloved albums on here. Beware, it does not have any tracks from Jarre's great \\"come-back\\" album \\"Oxygene 7-13\\", which came out shortly after \\"Images\\".<br /><br />A much better compilation is \\"The Essential Jean-Michel Jarre\\" (14 tracks, 50 min., released in 1983 (and out of print), not to be confused with the similar titled 2005 release), which I had as a vinyl when it came out in 83 and which I stumbled upon the other day at the used bin of my local independent CD store. I couldn't believe my luck! It has the best tracks of his then 3 albums to date (Oxygene, Equinoxe, The China Concerts) and it is candy to the ears from beginning to the end. Check it out. If you see it by chance, grab it! I rate this 4.5 stars.
0312997221|5.0|A powerfully gripping thriller.  You are pulled into the complicated plot, page by page.  Forsyth's attention to details is masterful.  Cal Dexter, a very believable protagonist (unlike the exaggerated characters that Jack Higgins creates) is a Vietnam vet.  The war created Cal Dexter.  He slithers through darkness as a tunnel rat.  Beneath the jungle, subterranean,  he learned how to be stealth, how to be lethal, but most important how, in black dark holes, how to conquer fear.<br /><br />Now, years latter he will, as a paid assassin, avenge the death of a grandson of a very rich and vengeful grandfather.  As you read, you know that Dexter will dig as deep as needed to find his target - a Serbian warlord.  You know that nothing will stop him, not even the powerful CIA.  Know this doesn't slow you down one moment; for you consume page after page, with no page lacking interest.  Always you are intrigued and engaged by this masterful storyteller.  For information junkies like me the numerous briefings on historical and political are bonus point. . Highly recommended.
B000063UR2|5.0|This was one of my top favorite movies to watch when I was a child, along with The Dark Crystal, Labrinth(yummy jareth), The Neverending Story, and The Goonies. I love the look, I loved the music, it was all so magical and captivating. I have to also add that I wasnt in love with Tom Cruises character Jack, I had the hots for Tim Currys character Darkness, twisted I realize, but I also had the hots for Dr. Frankenfurter. Something about those evil men, and Tims voice in particular. Legend IS a legend amoung the films of the 80's, and will be so till the end of time.
B00097A5HW|1.0|It's a real torture to listen only to the snippets. I would not take this disk free.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|ok... 1.5 stars for this one. Probably the most commercial DT album ever to come out. All this fuss about its greatness and genius are only due to overexcitement. Let's get to details. <br /> <br />The Root of All Evil is probably a failure to produce a powerful metal song, and shows some big lack of originality! This has nothing to do with previous DT metal where you could find amazing guitar riffs and superb progressions.  <br /> <br />The Answer Lies Within... too soft, too cheasy, and not even catchy... I don't know why DT made such a starter for their album, they could at least have put solid songs on track 2 to attract listeners. For example, my first listen ended here, as I was on the edge of destroying my CD player. <br /> <br />These Walls has the worst guitar sound you could ever see... this is Korn not DT, the riffs are too blured and distorted, that you come to think of a new metal band playing their first radio song, lots of bass, lots of noise, lots of cymbal drumming.... deception. <br /> <br />I Walk Beside You... AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! OH MY GOD!!!!!!! HORRIBLE TRACK!!! I never thought DT could get this \\"pop-rock\\"!! The Chorus is a C-G-Am-F style progression, just like common radio commercial stuff, and verses aren't any different! On the top, the scale change at the end made me laugh, climax there, once again, turned the player off... PATHETIC <br /> <br />Panic Attack is a descent effort, but not for DT, I find it suffering from the main disease of the album: lack of originaliy. Riffs are all some short progression based on E, trying to sound metalish.... Drums are fine, as always, but put together with songs, sound a bit out of place... <br /> <br />Never Enough, the Muse pastiche, nothing special in my taste, the opening and main riff are, once again, UNORIGINAL, you feel an 14 year-old wannabe can come up with this stuff (maybe on a slower tempo...). Plus, Petrucci still has the guts to pull riffs in \\"A- A-G-Bb-A\\" style trying to sound \\"oriental\\",well oriental my ***, I'm lebanese and believe me local pop stars come out with better melodies... <br /> <br />Sacrified Sons. The first progressive track of the album, a nice one actually, if it wasn't for the 9/11 subject which is a little out of date now, and can get really boring. But music is good, no cheasy riffs, drumming regains prog energy, and riffs sound like DT again. Well led song, with good intro and nice ending. Ruedess does a fine job here. <br /> <br />Octavarium. The Song that made me put 1.5 stars instead of one, a great song that has been well commented before, and that has \\"70's prog elements...\\". I won't reapeat what's already been said... <br /> <br />PS: I was probably a bit agressive on this one, but negative points needed to be pointed out. TOT sucks worse
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Let me preface this by dedicating it Bill O'Reilly. What are all the \\"hatuz\\" griping about. They could gripe about my grammer, seeing as I ended that last sentence with improper punctuation, or the fact that I spelled \\"grammar\\" wrong (I'm sure one spelling is correct). But no, they pick on Cannibal Corpse. Cannibal Corpse is awesometastic. My Chemical Crap-mance doesn't hold a corporate candle to Cannibal Corpse whatsoever. To conclude: BEST COVER ART EVER!!! Check out the doozy for Tomb of the Mutilated.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|The problem here is that the audience this movie is aimed at doesn't have the life experience--or the attention span--to get it.  And anyone old enough to get it probably won't see it.  You might as well show Two Lane Blacktop to people who came to see Two Fast, Two Furious.<br /><br />Still, with a bit of judicious editing, N.D. could have been tailored to the right audience.  Napoleon comes home and, tired of being picked on, heads for dad's gun cabinet.<br /><br />Locked 'n loaded, its back to school for some serious detention.  Before going down in a hail of bullets Napoleon whacks most of the football team, narrowly missing a cheerleader in a low cut, tight-fitting top and a teacher, in a low cut, tight-fitting top.<br /><br />Soundtrack by Fear Factory; direction by Oliver Stone (who lays down some nonsense about it being a serious commentary on the state of American society).  This could be HUGE.<br /><br />Then again, I found it pretty funny just the way it is.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I first heard \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, Part One,\\" while living in Fresno, a land of mongoloids in monster trucks and thick monoxide air.  In this hellish miasma, the glittering, video-game world of \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots\\" offered a shimmering path to psychedelic pop sanity.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise to find that the other tracks are even better.  \\"In the Morning of the Magicians\\" features a throbbing bassline that only teases through the orchestral overtures, never repeating into reduncancy as the radio-friendly would.  \\"Do You Realize\\" is a clarion call to those consumed with earthly travails to realize the mind-boggling majesty of the scientifically certain.  The entire album creates a fuzzy warm pink-hued video-game atmosphere reminiscent of psychedelic mushroom Super Mario Bros., but also registers a thoughtful poignancy through the beauty of the music and the wistfulness of the singer's voice.  The music is the flip side to the darkly paranoid and megalomaniacal but also techno-beautiful sounds of Aphex Twin.<br /><br />This is a kind of album that not only sonically soothes but also makes the mind wander and wonder what the lyrics signify.  What are the pink robots... videogame avatars?  bureaucratic government workers?  those who do not realize?  the silver people on the shoreline who do not let us be?  Who knows?  A big, blind, groping question, and yet another aspect of wonderment brought to us by the Lips' symphony.
074325144X|5.0|For Kate, who posted a little over a month ago, yes, the running technique in this book will eliminate your shin splints.  I've had shin splints for about 15 years, and ChiRunning enabled me to run without my shins hurting.  I had never thought that would be possible for me.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|YES!YES!YES!at first i was a little scared.It was rather pricy and i didnt no if anthony would have a good voice or not.those thoughts quickly vanished.I couldnt get over how alot of songs were alot better live.Every song has a different and largly improved solo(great job john),and some songs they add and change around to them. <br /> <br /> When i saw the listing, i reallized all exept for 4 were from by the way and californication, and 3 from bssm.So I just asumed havana affair was one of there old songs,but was wrong.havana affair is a remake of the ramones.never heard the origanal,but bassed on this version, this song is exelent.A highlight for sure. <br /> <br /> songs like dont forget me and throw away your telivision are only ok on the studio, but they really brigh it to life live.The piece that they add to throw away your television is great,making it one of the best on here. <br /> <br /> they did a really cool versions of scar tissue ,parrellel universe and the zepher song. All of them with just flat out amazing solos and there long to! <br /> <br /> The only ones that arnt that good live is by the way,right on time and universally speaking, but they arnt that great to begin with. <br /> <br /> There are alot of jams to.The best one is the californication intro with john and flea battling.They jam before the power of  equality and right on time.John does a really cool high pitch mini song early on and does a bit of singing before parellel univese.One other jam is fleas bass solo that leads into around the world.you watch that solo, then try telling me that hes not the best bass player ever.The guy is just so incredible.The really sweet guitar solos can be found in scar          tissue,zepher,californication,parallel univere,dont forget me,give it away,and a really cool riff on venic queen. <br /> <br /> So really good vocals, absalutly amazing solos by john and flea and i forgot to say about the kick ass drum solo before californication(which flea plays his saxamaphone with) equals the best live performace you will ever see(along with zepelin). <br /> <br /> Must buy for any fan and if your new to the peppers, this would be the best start.
0393317552|5.0|Mr. Diamond does an excellent job in Guns, Germs, and Steel of explaining how civilization spread across the world. I think those critical of the book are perhaps expecting too much out of it. Mr. Diamond shared his thoughts about what factors led to the disparity between societies. I don't recall him saying with authority that this was the only factor. Rather, he presents it as the main reason. He takes a very statistical approach. Since we know that in a given population selected at random we are all basically the same we need to look at factors beyond the individual. What has existed with us throughout history? The world has. This is why he chose geography. He also doesn't discredit the contributions that individuals made to society. His main point was that humans are all unique in their day but on a grand scale as individuals we mean nothing. I think this offends many of his critics and causes them to discount his other rather logical point. Inventions were inevitable (including religion). He explains this in his chapter on the domestication of crops. Yes, many will this chapter dry and uninteresting (personally I loved it) but it does set the basis for his theory. <br /> <br />The problem with Mr. Diamonds critics are that they are stuck on certain events that don't match the theory. Like how come Native Americans don't rule the world? They had the best crop land. Well, Mr. Diamond explained that they hadn't yet domesticated crops or animals. Corn was in its infancy and it takes centuries to produce a crop worth settling down.  <br /> <br />To be critical I ask that Mr. Diamond leave his personal experiences out of any further books. I was looking for a book on the evolution of societies not one that talks about your experiences in Montana. I did not find them relevant.  <br /> <br />All in all, it's a good read. It's not revolutionary thinking but it is the most comprehensive work to date.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|This is essential Bowie.  I own many of his CD's from across the span of his career and \\"Reality,\\" holds up great in comparison.  Bowie does not leave his roots and instead adapts his music for the listeners of today.   <br /> <br />1. New Killer Star: 5/5. Relentless song that is made better by the wailing guitars. <br />2. Pablo Picasso: 5/5 <br />3. Never Get Old: 5/5 <br />4. The Loneliest Guy: 2/5.  Seems like something that would be included at the end of \\"Low.\\" <br />5. Looking For Water: 5/5  <br />6. She'll Drive the Big Car: 5/5 <br />7. Days: 4/5 <br />8. Fall Dog Bombs The Moon: 4.5/5 <br />9. Try Some, Buy Some: 4/5 <br />10. Reality: 4.5/5. Something out of the universe of \\"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust.\\" <br />11. Bring Me The Disco King. 2/5 <br /> <br />Two weak songs in the company of many greats.  \\"Reality\\" is a must buy.
B0000714BP|4.0|The star power alone is enough reason to watch this delightful movie. Yes, it's saccharine Hollywood sentimentality and little of the over-the-top dares that made \\"Priscilla\\" what it was. But...  <br /> <br />  \\"Too Wong Foo\\" is more than worth watching, especially for the performances and the countless cameos. Kudos to all the stars for taking the risk and bringing this story on screen, and for giving performances that dare Hollywood stereotypes about \\"star image,\\" when there was no Will & Grace. John Leguizamo walks away with the movie, effortlessly. If Naomi Campbell was a dragqueen, she'd be Wesley Snipes -- sure enough, she's the one who taught him how to walk in heels, rumor has it. Patrick Swayze has great moments, at times elegant, and then at times reminds one of Jack Lemon in \\"Some Like it Hot.\\" What can you say about Stockard Channing except that she wins your heart.  Among the most memorable cameos, the innimitable Robin Williams. And if you watch the camera pan in that same scene, you might chuckle as you catch a glimpse of none other than George Costacos.  <br /> <br />  The film's color, costumes, the unbelievable makeup and hair transformations and off-the-cuff theme, are best when they don't try to pass for real. Give me the fairytale, give me the glamor. A fun reminder of the RuPaul days.
B000957O7S|5.0|This movie had to deal with a lot of hype-- many funny scenes in the previews, many expectations of the actors, and many people telling me how good it was.  The movie followed through and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Not all of the funny scenes were in the previews, as is sometimes the case with comedies.  The Acting was good, I don't really think there were any weak actors in the cast.  The plot was original, and creative, and pretty darn funny.  If you want a light-hearted comedy, I'd recommend this movie for any audience.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|This is yet another essential ingredient to your Iron Maiden collection. It is a great set of DVD's that come at a very reasonable price (just a few bucks more expensive than a CD but has sooo much more on it). The first DVD has some good live footage, and includes the best live performance of \\"Hallowed be thy Name\\" that I have ever seen (found on the \\"Beast\\" Tour footage). The second DVD chronicles the early history of Iron Maiden, showing the band go from a street band all the way to the release of \\"Piece of Mind\\". This is a good treat for Maiden fans, and it comes at a very reasonable price. Worth every penny.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Though I am not an avid fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and have not seen a minute of Angel, I do appreciate Joss Whedon's creative prowess. I must say that Firefly is by far the best TV show I have yet to see. I rarely watch TV and only found this DVD box set through message boards about the upcoming movie Serenity. In any case, this DVD set is definitely a must-have. Worth more than five stars, in my personal opinion.
B00006690G|5.0|From top to bottom, Eminem pretty much outdoes himself on this album, lyrically and production wise. Him and Dre put some of their greatest effort into this album, and it showed. The only suspect tracks on here are \\"My Dad's Goin' Crazy\\", and \\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\", cause one's too goofy to listen to on a regular basis, and the other is just nothin' special. But everything else is pretty much classic material, including the slow tempo \\"Drips\\" w/ Obie Trice, \\"Til I Collapse\\" w/ Nate Dogg, \\"White America\\", \\"Square Dance\\", the Sting(I think)-sampled \\"Sing for The Moment\\", the face-paced \\"Superman\\", \\"When The Music Stops\\" w/ D-12, \\"Business\\", and \\"Say What You Say\\", w/ Eminem and Dr. Dre annihilate Jermaine Dupri. Now that's ten songs I just named, who else in recent memory has had THAT many top notch on an album, where the filler material beats out other people's BEST work. If you slept on this album, it's just cause you hated on Em, and you just couldn't get the Ja Rule and Bow Wow outta your headphones.
0800141849|5.0|The above Chinese saying means \\"after seeing hundred times, you still won't get tired of it.\\"  This is how I strongly feel about this film. I've played Barbara's teaching scene again and again, and appreciate every line.  I nodded, I smiled, I clapped while listening to her, just like I was at that very class. Rose is surely an ideal image of a professor, with humor, with wit, with nature of warm sharing.  <br />I like Jeff Bridges very much ever since I saw him in \\"The Fisher King\\".  He deserves more appreciation for his wonderful performance in both of these characters.   <br />There are too many scenes I love about this film.  Barbara is such a talented director to give her wonderful touch to those details.  Here I'd like to bring up something about her performance which might not be noticeable -- Barbara \\"holds\\" tears in her eyes without letting them go. For instance, she saw Barry, whom she turned down his dates, kissing his fiancee with passion.  Also the last scene, she has tears in her eyes after hearing Gregory saying that she's beautiful while she's in pajama with her hair messy. It's so true in our real life that we have strong feelings sometimes, yet, don't want to show to others, we then hold the tears in our eyes very hard. They are actually the most touching moments.    <br />To me, this is a movie about people's struggling of \\"rationality vs. sensibility\\", and \\"living in others' eyes vs. being what you are\\". It gives me high sense of loving sweetness and wisdom.    <br />Thanks, Barbara and Jeff, also the original French script.  Great Work of Art !! <br />            <br />
0671799320|5.0|The definitive documented history of petroleum's profound influence on the course civilization. A fascinating read.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Yes, Batman Begins is as good as all the other reviews have stated.  It's a different twist compared to all the other Batman films.  It's more mind-driven then action-driven.  And that's not saying that there aren't action sequences, but it actually has an exciting story that causes its great appeal too.  The cast is absolutely fantastic.  Bale plays a wonderful Batman who is able to change his attitude in the split of a second as his personality goes from Batman to Bruce and vice versa.  Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Ken Watanube, and Tom Wilkonson are great as always.  Katie Holmes did a great job, but it wasn't an oscar winning performance.  The storyline is very creative and provides an interesting twist (compared to the normal Batman tales) as does most of Nolan's work.  Overall, great film!
B000683VI4|5.0|I barely noticed this movie when it came out last summer in the theatre. It was not my type of movie, or so I thought.  <br />Looked mushy and probably corny to some degree. I heard all the teachers at work talking about it, and some of them read the book. I just ignored it to the best of my ability.  <br />I have come to think of myself as an epic movie lover. I have gravitated toward \\"boy movies\\" for the past 10 or so years (with the exception being Steel Magnolias--which has some parallels, but moving on...). <br />Last week I had a day to myself with nothing much to do. I decided to pick up a few movies and spend a day watching films wrapped in a blanket. <br />I found a few I wanted to see and was searching for one more to add. I walked past The Notebook. I thought about it. Why not?  <br />I watched all of my other films first. It turns out I saved the best for last, however unexpected. <br />I could not take my eyes off the film. I have watched it many times this week, and I cry every time.  <br />It is a beautiful love story to say the least. The appeal I think is the deep love conveyed by actor Ryan Gosling (Noah) for his sweetheart Ally (Rachel McAdams). <br />I guess girls are suckers for that whole undying love thing. The thought that this gorgeous sweet man loves so deeply for this women, that no amount of time or tragedy can get her out of his mind or heart. <br />I am torn on my overall feelings after the movie. It makes me very sad, but I fight that feeling. I try to relish in the positive and beautiful parts of story. It makes me realize that love stories are my cup of tea after all.
B00005JNJT|5.0|The question with Batman Begins is, \\"Why does this movie need to exist?\\"  When I first heard of the project, it struck me as odd, considering that the original Batman is not an \\"old\\" movie.  Also, if you count the entire previous franchise, it just ended in 1997!  Eight years is hardly a lot of time to call for a remake.  Also, the original Batman is one of my favorite superhero films. <br /> <br />On the other hand, great as the original Batman was, all of the sequels were bad.  The last film in the series, Batman and Robin, (helmed by that hack, Joel Schumacher) was un-watchably bad.  Still, I was having enough trouble dealing with a remake of Superman - and that movie is over twenty years old.  Why Batman? <br /> <br />The original Batman jumped into its story in the midst of things: Bruce Wayne is already Batman, and that is how we see him in the first scene.  Although the original gets the tone right, we never delve that deeply into the mind of Bruce Wayne.  What makes Batman Begins the best of the Batman movies is because - dare I say it? - it is a character study.  The model Batman Begins follows is the original Superman movie: we begin in the hero's childhood, and explain who he is and how he got to be that way.  Like Superman, the superhero doesn't make his first appearance until half-way into the film.  The price of this is that we sacrifice some action.  The benefit is that we have memorable, three-dimensional characters. <br /> <br />If Batman really existed, this would be him.  Christian Bale is perfect for the part.  (For some reason, the movie is populated by Brits doing American accents.  Probably because they are better actors than we are).  We believe that Bale can be dangerous and he effectively creates different personalities for the playboy Bruce Wayne, the real Bruce Wayne, and the Batman.  (His characterization of the playboy is shockingly close to his performance in American Psycho.)  Unlike the Tim Burton film however (which I still love), this movie attempts to take place in the \\"real\\" world.  Of course, as Jim Gordon points out at the end, the introduction of Batman into Gotham City will surely produce the creation of equally outrageous villains. <br /> <br />A final note: One of the great things about the movie is the way it sets up relationships that we know will play out in the future.  Pay attention to that little boy Batman saves.  Doesn't Batman eventually get a helper? <br />
0689859368|5.0|I found the first Spiderwick Chronicle a big hit and found it nothing like The Series Of Unfortunate Events.Jarred gets into a lot of fights in school ever since his dad left him, his twin brother Simon, older sister Malory and Mum.So when he moves into his new house he notices a lot of strange things that his knowledgable twin and spunky sister notice too.There is somebody, living in the wall of their new house creating a whole series of mayhems around the house.After his Mum suspecting him as the culprit, Jarred is determined to put a stop to the evil creature and prove himself innocent.<br /><br />Spiderwick, for me was an entertaining read, and proved a lot of sayings to me such as:Don't trust a book by it's cover.Holly and Toni have done excellent jobs on the completion of their first book and i can't wait to put my head into the second. These books are cool!
B000002UZ1|5.0|This albun is one I still have on black vinyl but it's too scratched to play. I ordered it and i was able to sit my car and sing Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields Forever and many other songs we all know the words to by heart. This is a feel good piece of our history and a fabulous dance back in time with music that is always popular. <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|You're all were expecting too much and now that its here you're all mad because you had this concept of a perfect album that should have been made.  Get over it.  This is not the most original album (how many artists out there ARE original except maybe radiohead and bjork) but it is full of great songs and i think that should be enough for some people.  Ok, you cut me down a tree and brought it back to me is a bad opening lyric and the hardest part is a cheesy song that should have got cut, and the earlier version of talk was better than this one; but if you measure the amount of great songs on this album compared to any other album out there (U2s newest album has about two out of eleven) you would be surprised.
B000002O4X|5.0|This soundtrack is one that I bought many years ago and it seems  to have grown legs and walked out of my flat. I have many times wished I owned it again and am lucky a friend told me about Amazom.com. I'm glad to have this back in my collection. It's soothing music and my heart really has an opportunity to enjoy this as well. It's also very romantic. My friend sets a fire on Friday nights in the fire place and this Friday we'll listen to this as we hold each other and watch the flames dance
B00008OLYN|5.0|This album is Great- the review below says a lot- but This may be their best- unbelieveable CD- pick it up!!!
B0007P3582|5.0|i have to fully agree with my man sam tannenbaum from texas. considering the fact that i am deaf it is amazing that an artist could captivate me the way 50 did. i even sent away for the lyrics in brail since i am blind also, some would even go as far as to say dumb. i look forward to more releases of this caliber.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|The first DT album, I have buy, was the great Awake, it have change my perception of progressive Music and greatly modify my way of composition... How many fan of progressive music aren't musician...??? <br /> <br />I always ask myself since 6DOIT then Tot if DT aimed the greatest commercial quality, or if it is the sucks Quest... <br /> <br />1 - The Root of All Evil - The continuation of Mike Portnoy's Alcoholics Anonymous saga started back on Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence with The Glass Prison and followed on Train of Thought by This Dying Soul. I never wanted to become alcoholic, but thanks to this saga, as Rhapsody has done with the emerald sword on me, my axe always on my shoulder... Sorry... Nothing really original in this song... <br /> <br />2 - The Answer Lies Within - Emptiest Ballad of DT, but a great performance for James Labrie whose voice fits perfectly to slow rythm and clean voices, who said very big pop singers??? <br /> <br />3 - These Walls - Linkin Park could have played this one... <br /> <br />4 - I Walk Beside You - U2 could have played this one... <br /> <br />5 - Panic Attack - First real DT song of the album, some good harmony, but we are far from Awake or I&Words... <br /> <br />6 - Never Enough - Muse could have played this one... A good classical guitar solo, in the middle, same effects that Matthew Bellamy on James Labrie Voice... <br /> <br />7 - Sacrificed Sons - ... <br /> <br />8 - Octavarium - Empty until 12'19, a progressive rock song which take a lot of time to say something, but after it's very Rock'n'roll, very good ending for an album... <br /> <br />I've bought this Cd for some listening and i've like 4 minutes in it... Like Metallica, if you are a old no-brain fan, buy this Cd... As a deep [&*!#] it could be a fan always buy a Cd , like I've done with these fabulous Octavarium... But real no brain fan would say with the Octavarium Tour T-shirt, \\"It's an excellent album of DT...\\" Or a poisonous present to someone you dislike... My last DT's album aimed, DT has died with Kevin Moore, and them memorie with SFAM... <br /> <br />Go buy some procupine tree, or planetX, or Spock's Beard, or SymphonyX, or Chroma Key... Them really plays progressive music, not soap...  <br />
B000929AJQ|1.0|I tryed to give this album a listen but GOOD GOD DID THIS SUCK. I already heard the horrible bite the hand that feeds you bite the hand that feeds you bite the hand...oh sorry, I got repetitive..probably from that damn song. I was never much a die hard fan so when this album came out I said \\"Hmm, maybe I will have a looksey\\". Boy what a fricken nightmare! Lame and boring.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|(Un)equal parts \\"Ichi the Killer\\", \\"Amelie\\", David Lynch and Jacobean revenge tragedy, \\"Oldboy\\" will fry your brain like nothing else released this year. Oh Daesu, a sloppy businessman with a penchant for booze, is mysteriously imprisoned for 15 years, during which he loses his mind and gets the best education TV can offer, emerging an embittered and mop-haired avenger. He kicks the crap out of a gang of street punks, eats a live squid, and charms the pants off a mysterious sushi restaurant worker. But why was he banged-up in the first place? <br />Oh Daesu's quest for answers - and, ideally, justice - is never an easy watch. Shockingly violent at times, downright disturbing at others, \\"Oldboy\\" is nevertheless shot throw with pitch-black humour and, more importantly, a sense of humanity that raises it above, say, the uber-pukefests peddled by Takeshi Miike. By the time it reaches its chilling denouement, you'll probably never want to watch another film again. I mean, what would be the point?
B000957O82|4.0|The Romantic Comedy Genre has slowly gone away over the past few years because the plots are really starting to repeat. Will Smith, although has done a little bit of Romantic Comedy in other movies, this is the first full length movie he has done in that genre and does a fine job. Playing a successful date doctor but has a little trouble himself when he meets Sara (played by the beautiful Eva Mendes), the scene when he kicks her in the face when on the ocean is hilarious. Kevin James will never be forgotten with his character, playing Albert. A lot of great scenes done by both Will Smith and Kevin James. The kissing scene was amazingly funny. The movie however, like some movies tends to get more stupid as it goes on. This movie almost falls into that trap a few times but it does have a great appeal with such a powerful cast, and a lot of great comedians pushing the movie on. Not the best movie of all time but definitely a great start to the comedy movies of 2005. <br /> <br />
B00000IWVS|5.0|This is a great recording. Argerich plays Chopin in a strong, fresh and powerful way. Only comment I have is that I feel that sometimes her tempi are (a bit) too fast, especially in the nocturne. The recording sound is not that great, but acceptable. <br />For me the highlights on this disc are without doubt the mazurkas. I feel this is THE way the mazurkas should be played, free, like an improvisation, but with a very specific, Polish rhythm. The mazurkas alone are absolutely reason enough to buy this disc right away. And what a beautiful pieces these mazurkas are! I feel that these pieces stand for the essence of Chopin's art: classical in form, revolutionary harmonics,  an improvisational character and beautiful belcanto melodies. <br />In short: don't hesitate, buy this disc right away! <br />
067144901X|5.0|This is clearly my 8 month-old son's favorite book.  He loves the pictures, animal sounds and rhymes, and giggles and laughs throughout the book.  He recently began turning the pages on his own- and turns them at the appropriate times because of the rhyming.  This book is the perfect size for his little hands and our little diaper bag.  We bring it everywhere and read it over and over.
B00068IOWC|5.0|Maybe that's why \\"joe down below\\" doesn't get it.  There will never be another Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby.  Get over it!  True fans don't want a replica of anything.  We just take what we can get and either like or not, no expectations other than knowing when U2 tours for this album, it will be a experience like no other.  They rock and after 25 years, are still bad ass!  Bono's vocals are as good as ever, the Edge as edgy as ever, and Adam and Larry as always moving you from the neck down.  No, I don't like every song on the album. But when does that ever happen in music?  I can't even pick a favorite from this album, there are too many to choose from, although this week it happens to be \\"a Man and a Woman\\".  Next week, who knows! ;)  I still love these Irish men!!!! They're beautiful, inside and out!!!
0446530573|5.0|Great cookbook. The recipes are concise and easy to make. Nice storyline also. The recipes are original and come out great every time. Highly recommended for anyone who loves Italian Food.
B00007ELEL|2.0|I must admit, I think this tries very hard to be counter-cultural and it has really great actors in it, but alas it just didn't hit the mark for me.  It is a hollywood production at heart, even if it has quirky details.  So it was striving to be like an Indie film, sincerely striving.  That made it boring to me.  Nothing to savor.  This is the only Coen film that failed for me, as I am a big fan of their other work.<br /><br />Not recommended, unless your like lazy bowlers who get into improbably wierd adventures.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|In 'closer',there are 4 main characters and two main couples.The couples are Natalie Portman(who gives a GREAT performance) and 'Cold Mountain's' Jude Law,with 'King Arthur's' Clive Owen and another GREAT performance by Julia Roberts.Clive meets Natalie,Jude meets Julia and the rest is history.Closer is a great relationship movie but not a cuddle up and watch with your significant other.This may be Julia's great performance,next to 'Mona Lisa Smile.'Natalie's first performance in 'The Professional' at the age of 13 built to other great movies,like the star wars saga and garden state,but those give absolutely no relation to her performance in Closer.
0792833279|4.0|John Travolta's role as Vincent Vega in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" would launch not only a major comeback in his movie career - but would also start a streak of money-making and well-received movies that he would star in.  One of the first movies in that streak that would follow-up \\"Pulp Fiction\\" would be \\"Get Shorty\\".    In \\"Get Shorty\\", Travolta stars as Chili Palmer - a collector for a Miami loan-shark who aspires to get into the movie business.  This role seemed tailor-made for Travolta.    It brings a solid cast to carry out the storyline - and they succeed in doing so.   While \\"Get Shorty\\" will entertain you and still is a good movie, ultimately I still find some weaknesses with the movie as a whole. <br /> <br />John Travolta's career has ultimately been defined by the characters he has portrayed.  One thing that probably hurt John Travolta's movie career is he has sometimes been put into some real \\"lemon\\" type of roles.   This was seen throughout the 1980s.  A prime example of this was Travolta playing \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine reporter Adam Lawrence in 1985's \\"Perfect\\" - bad movie and a bad match of a role for Travolta.  At the same time, the better Travolta matches up with the character - the better the movie is.     Travolta's performances as \\"Saturday Night Fever\\"'ss Tony Manero and \\"Grease\\"'s Danny Zucco are prime examples of how well Travolta matched up with the character.     It is completely fair to add \\"Get Shorty\\"'s Chili Palmer to the list of characters that Travolta matches up very well to.    In fact, this might be one of his best roles. <br /> <br />The story of \\"Get Shorty\\" is as follows:   Chili Palmer is Miami Loan Shark collector who is a big fan of the movies.   When his \\"Boss\\" dies, Chili's arch-enemy Ray \\"Bones\\" Barboni (played brilliantly by Dennis Farina) becomes his new boss.    Ray sends Chili to Las Vegas to collect on a debt.   While collecting on the debt,  Chili learns of another person who owes money - low-budget movie producer Harry Zimm (played by Gene Hackman).   When Chili heads to Los Angeles and meets up with Harry, he becomes intrigued with getting into the movie business.    With Harry in-debt, Chili convinces Harry to take him in as a producer for a film is is doing.   However life isn't going to be that easy.     Harry is also dealing with some loan-shark characters in Los Angeles - most notably one named Bo Catlett (played by Delroy Lindo).   It turns out that Bo wants in on the movies as well.    Chili will soon team-up with actress Karen Flores (played by Rene Russo) who has worked with Harry.   Chili and Karen's job is going to be to convince Karen's ex-husband - big time movie star Martin Weir to be in Harry's movie.   Ultimately, the loan-sharking dynamics between Ray, Bo, and Chili are ultimately going to come into play as everyone is going to want to either collect their debts and/or get a fair share of Harry's movie. <br /> <br />One thing that makes Travolta's character Chili Palmer stand out is going to be the flawless and smooth delivery of his dialogue.      This has always been a Travolta staple going back to his Vinny Barbarino (\\"Welcome Back Kotter\\") and Tony Manero days.  This is especially evident as each time when Chili confronts someone he says \\"Look at me\\".   However there are many one-liners that Chili Palmer will deliver - and help build his character throughout the movie.   One of my favorite parts is when Harry introduces Bo to Chili as his \\"associate\\".   When Bo questions Chili on who he really is, Chili replies in a very smooth manner: \\"It's what he said, I'm his associate\\".   In addition to the dialogue, Chili Palmer is going to have some great scene presence.  This is best seen each time Chili \\"appears\\" in someone's room. <br /> <br />There are three other significant performances that stand-out in this movie.   Gene Hackman does a very nice job playing the low-budget filmmaker Harry Zimm.   Hackman might be one of the most busy and versatile actors in the business.  He does a lot of movies - but also is very adaptable to any-type of role.   Delroy Lindo's portrayal of L.A. mobster Bo Catlett is terrific.   Like Travolta, he is flawless at portraying someone who is a a very \\"smooth\\" character.    Finally, Dennis Farina's portrayal of Miami mobster Ray \\"Bones\\" Barboni is also outstanding.     Farina plays a very similar-type of character to that of Jimmy Serrano in \\"Midnight Run\\".  He is going to have a lot of quick one-liners and really is going to be a highlight of the movie.   Also worth noting \\"Sopranos\\" star James Gandolfini plays \\"Bear\\" - a collector for Bo Catlett. <br /> <br />There are also three uncredited performances:  Bette Midler plays a girlfriend of Harry Zimm,  Penny Marshall has a cameo at the end of the movie as a director, and David Groh (famous from \\"Rhoda\\") is going to play Martin Weir's agent. <br /> <br />There are two problems with this movie.   While I did find the storyline entertaining, I did find it extremely confusing to keep up with the specific \\"details\\" of the story - namely who is who and who did what.   Perhaps this traces back to the original Elmore Leonard novel for which this book is based on.  I usually prefer my films at a \\"simpler\\" level - and I think that would have helped this story.   The other problem is that I found the ending to be weak.   While I think this movie does a very good job at not \\"dragging out\\" the ending, I ultimately found the ending a bit anti-climatic.   It was an ultimate let-down to a movie that despite the confusing \\"details\\" of the plot, does provide an entertaining edge. <br /> <br />Overall, I think when we look back at John Travolta's career someday - Chili Palmer is going to be one of his best remembered ones.  Despite some of the weak points, this is still one movie I'd recommend.
0689835604|5.0|My 8 month-old son loves this book.  Sometimes I just say \\"peek\\" when we see the babies faces under the flaps- instead of saying \\"under the hat\\" for example.   He laughs and giggles.  He now lifts the flaps himself-- apparently he has been paying attention as I read the story the last month (some lift from the top and some from the bottom).  He loves that he can do this himself. My only complaint: the flaps are a bit flimsy and one has ripped off completely.  I will need to glue it back on.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|It seems that most of the people who flame this album loved the first two albums and those who liked this one weren't too happy with the first too. Personanally, I fit into the second category. I've heard parts of the first two and the only song I ever really liked from them was \\"Wait and Bleed.\\" I just can't get into screaming vocals like many reviewers here seem to. Maybe that's why I like this album more than the others; the vocals. They're cleaner, if you hadn't already seen that in almost every other review. I can't really say anything other than what others have said so all I'll really tell you is this: \\"listen to a couple of the samples and decide for yourself whether or not you think you'll like it,\\" because it really is either hit or miss with people. Not the best cd I've ever heard, but definately a pretty good one. <br /> <br />ps. Someone mentioned that there's less cursing and that they've lost their creative lyric writing or something. However, I'd like to know how, if you use less cursing, it's less creative. Wouldn't that be more creative?
0385338082|3.0|I'm not into chick lit and this was the first book I read (minus Bras and Broomsticks which is fabulous btw) in trying to get into the genre. And I guess, for me this book was OK.    I'd much rather see this book in a movie adaptation. Like one of those romantic comedies you see and forget. I'm to understand that Kate Hudson is currently acting as Emma Corrigan for the movie version of this book and, as much as I love Kate Hudson, I'm actually looking forward to it. But, again, to the book at hand...    Two things I admire about this book. One, Emma Corrigan. I was glad to see her change from a whiney, white liar to an honest, assertive young woman. Second, Jack Harper. All I can say is, Jack Harper IS a wonderful man! If you are looking to escape from the dull drums of the single, uncommited man, then this is a good story to escape to.    Above all, this book is a great read for those who are into this kind of genre. On the other hand, if you're more into titles such as Memoirs of a Geisha and The Other Boleyn Girl, this book isn't for you unless you're wanting a light read.
B000002H97|5.0|Well wtf do you expect me to say? This was Metallica's last album worth listing to. And in fact, I personally loved it. Yes, it was slower than all of their previous albums, but it really did rock. In fact, there wasn't a bad song on the disc. What you have to realize is that Metallica had grown as people and as musicians. Having said that, this album was as close to a perfect ten as you can hope to get.   So why did so many people hate it? Well, it wasn't pure thrash like \\"Master of Puppets\\" or anything earlier. It was also a commercial success, which isn't normally viewed as acceptable in the metal community. There is a reason why it succeeded though, and that is because of the fact that it really did rock. C'mon, Enter Sandman is a noteworthy song, and put Metallica, and for that matter, Metal on the map. That's not where it ends though, every song on this album is good. They're REALLY well produced, and all have the Metallica signature. They really are talented musicians, and they showed it on this album. Bob Rock did a fantastic job of putting this together, and should be commended.  The tour that followed this album also helped out Metal. The opening spot on this tour was a coveted one and helped out a great many bands. I saw both Queensryche and Guns 'N Roses on this tour.     I really recommend this to all Metallica fans. In fact, I recommend this to all music fans. This was Metallica in their prime. Unfortunately, they really sucked after this album and they sold out to nu-metal. Just listen to this album, and then the earlier ones. Enjoy Metallica when they were metal. Otherwise try Megadeth, Anthrax, Strapping Young Lad, Children of Bodom, and Slayer. Keep the METAL flag flying high!
B00049QQHI|5.0|I must admit this movie really had a huge effect on me. After watching this, I thought to myself, \\"How could anyone do drugs like this?\\" The look of this film matches the tone of it, which is a dark, gritty feel of the streets of Brooklyn during the 1960's. <br /> <br />This movie basically takes a real life teenager and throws him down the wrong paths in life. You can really see Leonardo DiCaprio's character grow more and more addicted to all these drugs. Physically, you can see his body become worse and worse as he becomes more plugged into the drug culture as nights go by. <br /> <br />I have a whole new appreciation for Leo DiCaprio. He was only 20 years old when this was made and you can tell, this young kid can act like a pro. <br /> <br />This film as a very indy-film look to it which seems to add to its realism unlike if it were a major Hollywood motion picture. So, if you want to see an emotional, tearjerking view of innocence crumbling into nothing, this one will suck you in.
0739307312|4.0|I bought this audiobook because I had heard so much hype about the book and the controversy.  I have two small children so I didn't have time to sit and read it but got to listen to it during my commute to and from work.  I have to say, there were some parts that made my knuckles turn white on the steering wheel because it was pretty intense.  And, a couple of times I had to sit in my car before going into work just because I had to find out what happened next.  I enjoyed the story, knowing that it is just a story.  Just my two cents.
B000002KLP|5.0|Prince may very well be the 80's incarnate. No matter who you thought was cool back then whether they admit it or not they thought Prince was cool. I've had this album on cassette and CD for years but it just didn't have enough hits on it for me. I picked it up on vinyl mainly because of the cover art work and because it was cheap, I put it on and Damn! Could be the best deal I ever got. I Can't believe I slept on this one. It's not just Prince at his best but the best of the 80's as well.  This album will have you transposed in time. It pulsates with raw energy yet sounds as if it were made in a basement. All the songs were originally intended to be demos only but were released as is. Prince wrote the lyrics and played most of the instruments himself including some of the best guitar work he's ever done. In a time span of under 40 minutes he plays the parts of sex-fiend, jilted lover,  balladeer, war protester, party animal, new-waver, stalker, and funkateer. Not bad for a 22 year old. This one is hot!
078322687X|5.0|Woah. This movie is a classic.It movie doesn't have much action or sex scenes. But what it does have is a great dialogue, and a story about 5 very different teenagers bonding together over an eight hour period. If you've never seen this movie, you are sure missing out on a lot! Make sure to get this movie and it will stand the test of time.
B00006JDS4|4.0|It seems as though a lot of people misunderstand Meir Zarchi's purpose for this film. These people need to watch it again and listen to his audio commentary. They label it exploitation(as I had done for so long), but Zarchi did not have that intention.  As for the title, \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\", that was a marketing scheme by some exec, again, not Zarchi's idea.  His intended title \\"Day Of The Woman\\" appears on this millenium ed. case under a.k.a. (I never did see why it was called \\"I Spit On Your grave\\" anyway- i thought it was a dumb title. \\"Day Of The Woman\\" makes more sense).  <br />When I listened to Zarchi's commentary, it all became clear to me <br />as he tells of the horrible event that inspired this film. As for  the rape scenes, yes, it is long and hard to watch, but Zarchi is driving home the sick reality of the crime of rape and in doing so, he is pushing us into Jennifer's corner -on her side- so we'll root for her and hold in contempt her violators. <br />When Jennifer does get her revenge, it is,i believe, Zarchi's messeage that this is what should happen to rapists; but never does.  I agree. <br />So I will never again refer to this film as exploitation and I will call it by its proper name \\"Day Of The Woman\\". <br />Those of you who can't stomach it, that's understandable, but people who just bash it on the grounds of its brutality and say it is degrading to women, need to wake up!   Siskel and Ebert even stood outside theaters when this film opened up urging people not to watch it...how stupid!  If anything this is a Feminist film about how a woman perservered. <br />Two more things: <br />*Also listen to Joe Bob Briggs' commentary <br />*I wonder what Roeper thinks of it
B0006GAOBI|2.0|I saw Donnie Darko about a year after it came out.  I had heard people talking about it for several months, the name more than anything, so finally watched it.  It is a truely amazing film, somewhere between sci-fi and fantasy, but not so much as to put off someone who is not a fan of these generas.  So naturally when the director's cut came out i was very excited.  It's well known how big studios have a way of destroying the vision of artists by changing storylines around and elimnating unnessary things like a \\"complex plot\\" and \\"character development\\" in order to make movies more marketable.  Many director's cuts have been released after the theatrical versions and have shown the vision of the director, the artist, to be superior to that of the studio exec, the businessman.  Examples include Gilliam's Brazil, Scott's Blade Runner, Beson's The Professional, and of course, Jackson's Lord of the Rings, though i think many of the edits in the theartrical version had more to do with time constraints than content.  This, however, is not one of those instances.  Kelly changes songs in the movie, altering the mood, and not for the better.  He cut a few scenes down; one in particular is the confrontation between Drew Barrymore and the principal of the school, the cut actually stunted the character development of the principal.  Many of the scenes that where added where unnessary (most can be found in the deleted scenes section of the special features menu on the original DVD) and didn't push the film forward, and some just gave the film a repetitous feeling.  One scene is between Donnie and his father; Donnie says that people think he's crazy, and his dad says \\"you're not crazy; i used to be crazy, but you're not crazy.\\"  Nothing more is said about this.  Kelly opens up a whole new dimension to the character of the father and then just leaves it.  It also raises further questions about if Donnie is privy to some alternate reality or if he's just suffering from some mentaldisorder that his father used to have.  The original didn't even raise this point leaving more up to the imagination.  He also added in graphically some radomly generated series of numbers and rotating pictures during Donnie's flashbacks which made it seem much more sci-fi than the original, which contained none of this.  One of the things that i liked so much about the original is that the story was very sci-fi, but the film itself didn't have any of the visual elements typical of sci-fi, thus making the film more enigmatic and harder to catagorize. <br />Basically, if you're hoping for another film that proves that the artist knows better, this isn't it.  The director's cut is less even and the mood is changed dramatically, and all of this done without adding much of anything to the story.  Buy the original, it's definetly worth the money, but rent this edition before you decide whether to spend the money on it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When you see Firefly in its entirety, not out of order or with episodes missing, it becomes an amazing series. The depth of the characters, the evolving inside humor, the fact that you understand the characters on a deeper than normal level. <br /> <br />Thank you Joss for this wonderful, quirky and detailed view of the future. <br /> <br />I can only hope that after the strong sales of the series, the hopefully strong late summer release of Serenity, the Firefly movie and the positive fan appreciation arising from these that FOX, The Sci-Fi Channel or another station will pick up the show and let it become what it should have been.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Ok, here are the basics...At The Drive In split...out came Sparta and The Mars Volta, both bands are talented and still making quality music, however the facts must be faced...The Mars Volta is a cluster of more talented, artistic, and diverse musicians. - My opinion is not biased, it derives from growing into a yearning for creativity, raw talent, and the edge to be enlightened. With that said MV is all of the above. - <br /> <br />      On with the album...the follow up to De-Loused, Frances the Mute obliterates all labels and proves that Mars Volta stands by the reason they created their band, to not fall into the genre trap. Over half of the album is in Spanish (it helps to know a little) which is awesome, and the music speaks for itself. <br /> <br />      All that can be said is just buy the album, it is great and the more you listen to it the more you will love it, it is worth the money.  (Note:If you are hoping to see a new and over-exposed MV then just save your money don't try to bottle up this album or pure creativity into any kind of category because it is a slash of many.) One more beautiful thing about FTM is that not even MTV and all 8 of the 13 year old girls that watch it can ruin this awesome album, buy it, buy DE-Loused, and buy the Tremulant EP if you yearn for more than the ordinary.
0754023818|5.0|My first foray into the world of Bill Bryson's work has left an indelible mark on me - i am in love with it, and cannot get enough of it. It's hard enough to try to get to know and write about a such a great expanse of land when you're not Australian -but Bryson for the most part successfully does so. As an Australian who has lived in the US for the past 8 years, I cannot say i would be able to write as comprehensively and accurately about his country as he has about mine!  <br />A sharp wit combined with a wonderful sense of humor made this a real page turner; Bryson accurately captures the essence and feeling of Australia - he comes not only to appreciate and understand us, but in the little pub in Daly Waters, I believe he becomes one of \\"us.\\" Bryson captures all the beauty, irony, sadness, history, and geography that makes up this beautiful place I call home, and his gentle blend of fact and humor and anecdote makes this an unforgettable read. To elaborate: his ability to point out the inherent irony in \\"losing a prime minister\\" and subsequently naming a public swimming pool after a man who drowned is something that has always baffled me too, and i'm Australian! Or the fact that our national volume of history is only written up to the year 1935 made me question just how \\"modern\\" Australia really is. Bryson reports several times throughout that \\"it feels like 1951\\" - and that was interesting to learn, given that it is his American perspective. So too, i can similarly say as much about America when i see an antiquated wood-panelled wagon pass me on the most advanced road system in the world, or people signing checks at the supermarket check out (checks are no longer in use in Australia), which makes Bryson's alien perspecitve on Australia  all the more interesting! <br />I enjoyed how Bryson gently touched on sensitive points too - our general lack of confidence and identity for example - i never knew how confused we were, when Bryson accurately note that we're not sure if we're brits or yanks, even in the green room!  <br />My only criticisms would extend to Bryson's implication that aussies are \\"self absorbed\\" - something which I would strongly argue as false, given that much more international news reaches Australia's four paltry television stations than it does any of the 400+ cable tv/news media in the US.  <br />Another point of contention: the implication that Australia tends to exist on the peripheries of the planet, outside of the \\"known world\\"(p238).  I personally found this to be offensive. Bryson's claims that \\"[in Australia] it is easy to forget....that there is a world out there\\" (p239) is blatantly untrue; in fact, i find that most Australians are very much engaged in world affairs both internally and abroad, and I would go so far as to say that I think they are more well informed on most international matters than are Americans. I tend to think it is Americans who are more \\"disconnected,\\" to quote Bryson here, and it is not the implied \\"distance\\" which is the cause, but a very controlled and closed media. The reason you don't hear anything about Australia in the US is simply because it is not of interest, it is not reported. Every Australian knows the name of the US President or the capital; however, ask the average American who is Australia's Prime Minister or where Canberra is and all you will get is a blank look in return. My only other quibble is that of the voice; i'm puzzled why Bryson would lend an Australian tone and slang to a book written from an obvoiusly American perspective? I would have prefered to hear \\"sweater\\" not jumper etc etc. as this lends to the authenticity of the author's work.     <br /> <br />Overall, a beautifully written, comprehensive and detailed account of Van Diemans Land. Bryson sure has done a lot of hard homework in between beers, and it, as well as his love for Australia shows. Further, i am sure all Australians will be thankful to him for many years to come for documentingthis place I call home.
B000002U8G|3.0|\\"Meddle\\" is generally well-regarded by Pink Floyd fans, and with good reason.  The band was finally starting to come together-- Roger Waters' songwriting was beginning to really reap rewards after several mediocre albums and the arrangements of the material were starting to improve.  Its also the first album where the legacy of Syd Barrett's sound appears to have been put aside-- there are no songs in the form of the material of those on \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\", and yet on at least one piece, it takes Barrett as an inspiration. <br /> <br />Nowhere is this escape more apparent than the second side of the album, consumed by the lengthy \\"Echoes\\".  Clocking in at over 23 minutes, it holds together far better than \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" did, and is actually quite a good song.  I suspect the strength of the piece is that it relies on one main theme and a lengthy solo section rather than moving from section to section as previous longform experiments did (although it does have a lengthy bridge that the piece would benfit highly from having removed).  Its also the first example of the sort of hazy sound that would dominate \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" later (and for those interested in this sort of thing-- it has a descending progression that Roger Waters claimed Andrew Lloyd Webber swiped for \\"Phantom of the Opera\\"). <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the first side doesn't quite live up to this-- there's a couple great songs on here, including a dark, driven instrumental in the vein of \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\\" (\\"One of These Days\\") and an unnervingly brilliant pop song that is really the beginning of Waters' lyrical reflections on Syd Barrett (\\"Fearless\\").  But the album runs out of steam beyond these tracks-- \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" and \\"San Tropez\\" are inoffensive but not particularly intriguing songs, and \\"Seamus\\" is downright bizarre-- an old Pink Floyd blues with a howling dog that grates pretty quickly. <br /> <br />Still, this is a decent album, and probably a good placeto begin exploring \\"pre-Dark Side\\" Pink Floyd, it certainly is the most similar of their early material to that album, and it'll give a taste for the band's early sound.

B00011RPB0|3.0|Whoa, it seems like everyone is really divided on this one. It's either a \\"best movie ever\\" or a \\"worst movie ever\\". To me, Lost In Translation is decent, but very overrated.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have with this movie is that there is almost no story, and almost no progression of any sort. 25 minutes into the movie, I was getting really bored waiting for the two main characters to meet up, because absolutely nothing was happening.<br /><br />Movies like Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and Napoleon Dynamite can get away with not having much of a story, because one of them absolutely drips with style and action sequences, and because the other one is so hilarious and off-beat. But Lost In Translation can't do that, because the focus is supposed to be on the two main characters, who aren't really...y'know, doing anything.<br /><br />The real treat here is the gorgeous shots of the city. The flashing lights of the city skyline at night, the amazing view from the hotel...it's awesome. So is the overall atmosphere of the movie. It really DOES feel like you're in an unfamiliar, distant, fascinating land. Being a huge fan of anime and Japanese culture in general, I can really appreciate that type of feeling. The music selection fits perfectly with the atmopshere too. My Bloody Valentine is my favorite band, and their breathtaking song \\"Sometimes\\" (as well as 4 other songs from the newly returned Kevin Shields...HELL YEAH!) played over the sparkling skyscrapers is the highlight of the film for me.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the dreamlike feel of the movie probably would've felt even more fleshed out if the two characters actually mattered to me. As it is, I really just don't care about Bob or Charlotte at all. They disappear into the background.<br /><br />Like I said, it's decent, but you can get the same effect from looking at pictures of the Tokyo skyline. Reccomended only for very artistic people.<br /><br />(Note: To the stuck-up 5-star reviews who think that the only people who hate this movie are braindead jocks who only like movies like xXx and The Fast and the Furious...do us a favor and shut the hell up. I like artsy, intellectual movies as much as the next guy, but Lost In Translation just flat-out isn't as deep as some people make it out to be)only like movies like xXx and The Fast and the Furious...do us a favor and shut the hell up.

B00009P1O2|3.0|I'm a big fan of Queen. However, I was disappointed when I watched my copy of Live at Wembley Stadium. The video often changes from dark to light. I don't know if the concert was done at night or late afternoon. It sometimes sends a \\" no signal\\" on my TV and the picture flickers. I thought somethings wrong with my 60\\" plasma TV so I used my other TV with of course different player, same thing happen. And it's not the disc because I ordered 2, the other is for my brother (also a big fan of Queen) and both disc have the same problem. The only reason I give 3 star is because the sound quality is good. I'll just to have wait for a better DVD....
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce has finally released a solo album and I think I speak for everyone when I say that Beyonce was always capable of levaing behind the security that comes from being a member of the girl group Destiny's Child and taking to the stage on her own.  She always screamed for attention when she was in the group and she always took creative control of the albums that Destiny's Child recorded.  Now she doesn't have to fight for the spotlight because her debut solo album proves she is a multi-talented and influential artist who has ambition and confidence to match her fame. <br /> <br />The album is unique in the sense that Beyonce remained committed to producing songs that could stand on their own aside from the album as opposed to recording a few original tracks and a lot of filler.  'Crazy In Love' is a masterpiece - an example of Beyonce at her best and it will always be the best song from the year 2003.  The production work is expertly crafted in order to create a fresh hip-hop sound that hits you hard each time you hear the track on the radio.  The lyrics and vocals are equally as infectious and the track lingers in your mind, but not in an annoying way in a good way.  It reminds you of summer and all the good things associated with Hip-Hop music and being in love. Jay-Z adds a hip-hop feel and makes the track more urban instead of being a rhythm and pop R'n'P track.  The closing track 'Bonnie and Clyde' is another smooth and hot slice of r'n'b and Beyonce's voice is perfect for creating a sexy and sensual love track.  She sounds street but very feminine and innocent.  A winning combination for any collaboration, especially one with Jay-Z. <br /> <br />Sometimes Beyonce wants to please evryone and she attempts to sing heartfelt and emotional ballads but this is not suited to her vocal ability.  She wants to be Mariah or Whitney but her voice sounds harsh and forced as if she was shouting and this makes it hard to listen to some of the slower tracks.  She does wellwhen she concetrates on singing urban up-temo tracks which have top production work and hot lyrics.   <br /> <br />Beyonce is a true star she is not a big-voiced Diva, but she does not need to break away from her image as an R'n'B chick.  This album shows that Beyonce is ahead of artists like Ashanti and J.Lo and this album is proof of the R'n'B starlet she is.  The fact that she has an involvement in the production stage is another bonus <br /> <br />
B000024D4R|3.0|When Pink Floyd released \\"Wish You Were Here\\" in 1975, they used about half the new material they had been working on the tour prior to the recording.  The remainder was used by Roger Waters as 2/3 of his Orwellian nightmare, \\"Animals\\".  The first album largely to bear his stamp as a songwriter, both in form of having a lot to say and in songwriting credits, many feel that \\"Animals\\" is the first Roger Waters solo record. <br /> <br />As usual, the truth is somewhere in between on all counts.  The rest of the band's contributions can't be underestimated, but guitar-driven rock and narrative focus is more essential on this recording than it has been on any previous Pink Floyd album.  The lack of presence of Richard Wright in the songwriting and vocal process and limited influence of David Gilmour furhters this.  The problem is that there just isn't enough good material-- each of the three main pieces (\\"Dogs\\", \\"Pigs\\", and \\"Sheep\\") are a bit overlong, and really a fourth could be used with each of these being shortened.  \\"Dogs\\" in particular seems to ramble on forever.  These are framed by a little acoustic number, \\"Pigs on a Wing\\", broken into two portions.  Still, as much as the material drags on a bit, Waters took the message to heart, his vocals at the end of \\"Dogs\\" and on \\"Sheep\\" are particularly venomous (check out his \\"bleating and babbling I fell on his neck with a scream\\" on \\"Sheep\\" for a good example of this) and a real highlight of the album. <br /> <br />Nonetheless though, Floyd did better in the past and would do better in the future-- \\"The Wall\\" in particular takes the concepts of fear and isolation somewhat expoused on this record and pushes it to the fore in a much better presentation.
B000000W5H|4.0|It's Only Rock And Roll isnt the best album The Rolling Stones ever recorded but it's still a very good rock and roll album. I mean its got the classic Stones line up of Jagger/Richards/Watts/Wyman/Taylor. The albums is packed full of classic Rolling Stones songs. There is no reggea crap on the album just good old fashioned bluesy influenced rock and roll! The guitar playing through out the album is top notch and probley this, It's Only Rock And Roll is the best guitar album The Rolling Stones created, which is sad because Mick Taylor, the virtoisic guitar player and arguably the best guitar player the Stones ever had left after this album.<br /><br />The album opens opens with it's best song, 'If You Cant Rck Me' which to this day has been a concert staple for the band. A true classic in The Rolling Stones catalog. If You Cant Rock me is concedered one of The Rolling Stones' all time best songs! As we roll along we come into another Temptations cover by the boys, 'Aint To Proud To Beg' which is my all time favorite temptaions song, and The Rolling Stones version is pretty good but doesnt have the same soul and passion as the orignal, but still a good cover. Next is the title track and the big hit single off the album and one of the classic songs ever recorded. 'It's Only Rock And Roll is easily one of the better songs The Rolling Stones have ever recorded, with brilliant slide guitar by Mick Taylor, and Mick Jagger's vocal swagger over self whorshiping lyrics, it makes the ultamite rock song!<br /><br />'Till The Next Goodbye' is a southern fried country flavored song that is somewhat repetitive but yet in someway still a good song. I'm not really sure what to say about the song you'll just have to hear it for yourself. 'Time Waits For No One' is one of the all time best songs ever recorded. This song features Mick Taylor's all time best guitar solo, any real guitar player can apreciate this song ever if they hated The Rolling Stones. It's dark and mysterious and a truly amazing song. Good old Keith Richards steps up to the plate and sings on the next track. Like all of the songs Keith sings lead on 'Luxury' is a great song full of rough vocals and great guitar playing. Keiths riff on this song is one of his all time best. Most people say that the next song is just filler but I have to disagree, 'Dance Little Sister' is one of the better songs on the album. It's a harder rocking song the If You Cant Rock Me and it has a very catchy hook, I think this is way better then Till The Next Goodbye, and most people say thats one of the best songs on the album. The guitar alone on this song puts it as one of the better tracks. 'If You Really Want To Be My Friend' is a slower ballad as only The Rolling Stones could do. Nice piano and backing vocals give this already beautiful song a great atmosphere. The next song is done in true Rolling Stones form, nice blues driven rock and roll with amzing guitar playing thrown in for accient. 'Short And Curlies' is a cool blues song that not many people like and I dont understand why, I absolutley love the song, it's one of my favorite songs on the album. The album comes to a close with 'Fingerprint File' which is the perfect song to close the album and really was a sign of things to come next in The Rolling Stones' carrear. It's kinda disco but not, it's kinda funk but not, which were two arears that The Stones were not afriad to explore on the albums that followed It's Only Rock And Roll.<br /><br />So with only one minor blunder on this album I cant see why people give it such a bad rap. Like I have stated it's full of Rolling Stones classics and even the songs that are not classics are still great rock and roll songs, with the exception of their country attempt Till The Next Goodbye, Which is strange because usually when The Rolling Stones would make a country song it was usually good. So with all this in mind, the next time you are in a record store do yourself a favor and pick up this classic album by one of the all time greatest bands ever! After all it's only rock and roll!c album by one of the all time greatest bands ever! After all it's only rock and roll!
B0002OERI0|5.0|This was the first Green Day Record i ever heard and i  bought it after only hearing one single (\\"American Idiot\\")and now i own all of Green Day's work. there is only one song on the record that i find annoying and that is \\"She's a Rebel.\\" the song is just tacky and sounds i bit too much like \\"Insomniac.\\"  still this is my favorite Green Day Album to date with a great story line. <br />here's a run through of the songs on the album: <br /> <br />#1. \\"American Idiot\\" 10/10:  the title track of the album this song is very political and speaks volumes.  plus on top of that it is just a kick a$$ song. <br /> <br />#2. \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" 15/10:  this song is amazing.  i love it! it's a five part masterpeice that is just awsome all the way through.  it starts of with some great lyrics: \\"I'm the son of rage and love/ the jesus of suburbia/ the bible of none of the above.\\" a true classic. <br /> <br />#3. \\"Holiday\\" 10/10: a great song that bags on Bush but it's over played. <br /> <br />#4. \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" 10/10: the first time i heard this song i was blown away! it's a raw power ballad that has some great lyrics.  though the song was over played WAY TOO MUCH i still think it's a great song. <br /> <br />#5. \\"Are We the Waiting\\" 10/10: This song is great.  it's sad but yet uplifting. <br /> <br />#6. \\"st. Jimmy\\" 7/10: the lyrics are cool but the song is kind tacky. <br /> <br />#7. \\"Give Me Novicaine\\" 8/10: this song is depressing (in a good way) and has a kick a$$ chorus. <br /> <br />#8. \\"She's a Rebel\\" 4/10: this song isn't that good. i really didn't like it. <br /> <br />#9. \\"Extroadinary Girl\\" 8/10: i didn't like it at first but now the songs grown on me and i like it a lot more. <br /> <br />#10. \\"Letterbomb\\" 8/10: a great song with great lyrics. <br /> <br />#11. \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" 11/10: this song is amazing! the song breaks away from the plot a little and Billie Joe Armstrong sings about the death of his dad.  the song is really well done and one of my favorite Green Day songs ever.   <br /> <br />#12. \\"Homecoming\\" 9/10: not as good as \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" but it is still am amazing five-part song. <br /> <br />#13. \\"Whatsername\\" 10/10: it's a really good end to the album and leaves the listener depressed.   <br /> <br />In short i thought this was an amazing album and Green Day's best to date.  i would recommend this album to anyone who likes great PopPunk songs that are really well done. and if you're one of thoughs Green Day fans who thinks that Dookie was thier only good album and everything else that they've made sucks...you need to get out of the 90's and stop being so cynical.
0784011176|5.0|You have to be a special kind of person for you to benefit from this movie. I thought it was stupendous? You have to be a total wierd romanic to appreciate this kind of movie. The acting is marvous, the story is the best, the acting in this movie makes it all come together. You won't be disappointed unless you are hopeless, or unromantic with absolutely no hope of ever finding true love.
B000002UA2|3.0|\\"Obscured by Clouds\\", soundtrack for a film titled \\"La Vallee\\" (best rememebered, like \\"More\\" for having Pink Floyd do its soundtrack) was assembled by the band as they were preparing \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\".  It is a quite good album, but it suffers from something that no other Floyd album from this period does-- it takes no chances. <br /> <br />The album essentially consists of three kinds of songs-- dull instrumentals that were clearly meant to support the film (\\"When You're In\\", \\"Mudmen\\", \\"Absolutely Curtains\\"), none of which are offensive, but none of which are particularly interesting, a couple rock songs, largely pretty lifeless (\\"The Gold It's In The...\\", \\"Childhood's End\\") and mediocre ballads (\\"Burning Bridges\\"). <br /> <br />But there are a few gems on here, and they're so good that they're worth noting-- \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" is a fantastic moody instrumental, evocative and exciting and would not have been out of place on Dark Side.  \\"Free Four\\", notable for being the first piece Roger Waters directly referenced his family history (\\"and you are the angel of death, and I am the dead man's son, he was buried like a mole in a foxhole and everyone's still on the run\\") is really quite a good song, jaunty and ecstatic in its presentation and absolutely morbid in its lyrics.  Its also one of the best vocals Waters ever delivered.  There's also a pair of fantastic love songs on here-- \\"Wots... Uh the Deal\\" and \\"Stay\\"-- that are really amongst the best the band ever composed in the ballad form.  The latter in particular is my favorite Rick Wright vocal. <br /> <br />Its not a great record, but its a good one, and there's a lot to listen to here, even if you have to get through a lot of fluff to get to it.  Worth checking out for Pink Floyd fans.
B0006J28L4|5.0|What a complex and rapid change of a life Malcolm X went through in the few short years he was on this earth. Many transformations occured through out his life from his early days as a hustler, thief and drug addict. Then getting sent to prison and converting to Islam under the wing of Elijah Muhammad. Then preaching his mentors'word to rallying Afro-americans together.  Soon to realize, Malcolm was the one being hustled by the very people he was trying to uplift. Malcolm then travels to Mecca for his pilgrimage thus to realize the seperation he has been preaching was wrong. He has been standing by the wrong cause, the wrong people and the wrong actions. By then it is to late for him and he is assassinated by his own people. We see how easy it is for someone to use religion to control people. Very tragic.     Spike Lee did a wonderful job as well as all the talented actors involved. Both documentaries are great.....even the deleted scenes offer more into the film. THIS IS A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|\\"Illinois\\" seems to be generating a surprising amount of mainstream buzz for one of the indie world's darlingest darlings-I heard somewhere that Sufjan was even interviewed in a recent issue of Entertainment Weekly or some such publication.  I expect that the hype accompanying this record will expose a much larger section of the population to Sufjan's music, and while we try-too-hard hipster types usually get all up in arms about our favorite artists breaking out of the narrow little indie-rock box, how could anyone begrudge this artist the success that may be coming his way?  Furthermore, why anyone would want to keep this record a secret is beyond me.  \\"Illinois\\" is an album with the power to change the lives of even the least-acquainted, most \\"mainstream\\" listeners.  I really believe that. <br /> <br />So anyway, if you're new to Sufjan and reading this page because you've heard something about this album, somewhere, please stop at nothing to get your hands on this record.  The man's made three great albums in a row, and this record is the perfect summation of what he's been up to in the past few years.  It surpasses even the mighty \\"Michigan\\"; even though Sufjan's working with a similar template here, the songs and arrangements are brighter, bolder, and that little bit better.  This is a fine and stunning introduction to his work. <br /> <br />Like the headline says, everything great that you've heard about this record is true.  In the same way, every minor quibble you've heard about \\"Illinois\\" may have a bit of truth to it as well; I'm not sure each and every track here is essential, but when you consider the wealth of beauty and invention this record has to offer, the positives far outweigh the negatives.  This man is blessed with some great gift-the how and why are up to the listener to discern, but I don't think any music fan in their right mind can deny that Sufjan is operating on a different, higher plane at the moment. <br /> <br />Where he goes from here, who can say?  He's clearly mastered the string section/girl choir/banjo motif.  Here's hoping he blows us all away with the next state too.
B000002GQH|5.0|I first heard this album when I was around 5 years of age.  The Moodies were still a young band, still trying to establish themselves into the rock-and-roll world.  This was at the peak of the 60's flower-power era, Viet Nam was the foremost thought on everybodies minds, and times they were a-changin'.  It was into this world that the third \\"High Concept\\" Moody Blues album was born.  With it came a combination of music and words that still, 30-plus years later, remains one of the most played albums in my collection. It truly is Classic Moody Blues!<br /><br />As I have grown up with this album, I now find the songs still as great as when I was younger.  Some are stories, some are just trippy.  Some sing of friendship, some are just melodic songs.  The beautifully crafted lyrics and lilting harmonies are always a joy to listen to.  True to Moody form, there is plenty of Graeme Edge poetry, Mike Pinder's mind journeys, and Ray Thomas' flute.  John Lodge is the only one who isn't at his best, but Justin Hayward is brilliant.  His \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\" will always be my favorite song.  It was when I was 5, and it is now that I am 40-plus.  (Justin Hayward has the most romantic voice I have ever heard, and is gifted beyond measure.)<br /><br />All the Moodies are gifted, and this album shines with some of their most inspired music.  Yes, it is old, and yes, it sounds a little dated.  But, it is a fine example of what music once was, and what it could be again.  (The cover art was pretty cool, too...one of the big reasons to miss vinyl records!)
B000002U82|5.0|Generally regarded as one of the essential albums of the rock genre and spending an unbelievable amount of time on the Billboard charts uninterrupted (somewhere around 15 years if I recall correctly), Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is a rarity, an album that actually lives up to its reputation.  Truth to be told, I haven't listened to it in several years before writing this review (like many folks, between my own listening and its endless airplay, I've burnt out on it), and the experience for writing this review has been quite rewarding. <br /> <br />One important thing about \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is that its an album statement-- it feels like one long song broken up into ten movements and its an exercise in studio wizardry.  Its also the point in the band's career when the songwriting of Roger Waters was beginning to apex but not at the exclusion of the works of any of the other band members, and as such is probably the last Floyd record not to dominated by Waters' personality (his stamp is pretty hardily felt, however). <br /> <br />The album generally sticks midtempo, picking up now and again, slowing down now and again, generally maintaining a haze in the pieces and a strong sense of unity-- it intertwines themes of aging and passage of time with that of madness, and endless slight reprises of either theme, mood, or sound effect lends a strong sense of unity to the pieces. <br /> <br />The songs themselves are pretty well known-- \\"Time\\", \\"Money\\", and \\"Brain Damage\\"/\\"Eclipse\\" have all received high rotation on FM radio, as has, to a lesser extent, \\"Breathe in the Air\\" and \\"Us and Them\\".  Add to this a couple effects driven pieces (\\"Speak to Me\\", \\"On the Run\\", the latter of which feels to presage synth-driven instrumentals), a wordless meditation on death (\\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\"), and a beautiful instrumental meditation (\\"Any Colour You Like\\") and you've pretty much got the record.  It reaches its apex at the end-- \\"Eclipse\\", a brief, often overlookedsong, with a fantastic three-part vocal harmony building part-by-part over the swirling backdrop. <br /> <br />If you don't own it and you're looking at this page, this is one of the essential rock albums, you probably should own it.
B000000OAC|5.0|News of the World is Queens finest album next to Night at the Opera. It has a cool variety of songs from nice and moving to in your face hard rock and more.<br /><br /> It starts off with the very popular duo 'We Will Rock You' and 'We Are the Champions' played at many sports stadiums.<br /><br />'Sheer Heart Attack' originally didn't hold my attention, since I thought it was to crazy heavy, but it grew on me and it's insane and crazy heavy! In your face! If that makes sense.<br /><br />'All Dead, All Dead' is a nice little song, very calm and darkish.<br /><br />'Spread Your Wings' really grabbed me the first time I heard the album, its quite a powerful moving song.<br /><br />'Fight From the Inside' is just a really cool Queen song that I really enjoy every single time I listen to it. Along with 'Get Down, Make Love' it makes me want to do what is says and the best part of the song is when it comes out of the weird instrumental part in the middle with some hard drumming going back into the song.<br /><br />'Sleeping on the Sidewalk' is my least favorite tune on the album. 'Who Needs You' is a fun little tune. 'Its Late' is another good song and the best of the last 4 songs. Then it ends with 'My Melancholy Blues' which isn't so bad either.<br /><br />All together its a pretty cool album, but the first seven songs are the better songs by quite a bit then the last few songs.<br /><br />Queen ROCK!
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|I love the Bourne movies and I think Matt Damon makes a great Bourne. The action is great in this second movie, as are the fight scenes, and the score (music) is excellent. The dialog and plot are also excellent. I can really imagine CIA people talking that way. The \\"turf battles\\" are no doubt realistic. The only thing I dislike in the entire series is the post-Watergate, leftwing politics of it all. I mean, the view of the CIA is that of the left in say, 1977 - i.e., the CIA is the real \\"threat to world peace\\", not, say, Bin Ladin. Knowing that real U.S. CIA men die in Afghanistan, like Mike Span, a true American hero, this type of post-Watergate worldview just leaves a stale taste in my mouth. I mean, imagine how much cooler and modern this series had been if Bourne were not fighting his own government, but rather, say, Al Quida. We can only guess how excellent that would be, because I doubt Hollywood wants to make that kind of film (\\"too simplistic\\", etc.). They would rather feed us reruns of TV series from the 1970s (\\"Bewitched\\") than create a movie that depicts true American heros. So all in all, this series and movie is excellent, but I take one star away, for the leftist political undertone to the whole thing.
0790734850|5.0|\\"LA Confidential\\" is a totally hardcore ride through the underside of human nature.  When I use \\"hardcore\\", of course, I refer to it in its adrenaline filled sense (as opposed to its \\"wonk-wonk\\" music meaning).  The setting of the film takes place in the \\"the gray area\\" between right and wrong.  There's so much deception and intrigue that it becomes practically impossible to guess as to what will happen in the end.<br /><br />Eventually, we see that, regardless of surface differences, the three main characters, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, and Russell Crowe, are all united by their distain for the mercenary and extortionate atmosphere on the LA police force.  Early on, when we hear the chief say to Crowe, \\"I particularly admire your use of violence on the job,\\" we know exactly why he acts as he does.  All three men have consciences and would prefer protecting and serving over the role they have been dealt.  They became policemen for the right reasons, but the wash of time eroded the clarity of what they stood for.<br /><br />Is this classic film noir?  Absolutely, and maybe better in quality than many of the classics.  The movie is so watchable that it seems to be over before it starts.  Not a shot or scene is wasted.  It's everything that a dud like \\"Cop Land\\" was not.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|Many people in the US knew Anastacia had breast cancer before they even knew she was a singer. Her appropriately self-titled third album is no diamond in the rough and it serves the purpose of establishing Anastacia as an artist in the music business for years to come. Unlike her previous two albums that were mostly one-dimensional and offered tracks that were gay-club friendly hits, this album offers desirable radio-friendly hits and also has it's own uniquely dark sound. Anastacia's vocal ability has definetly surpassed that diamond in the rough status as she has learned how to control her voice and tone it down a bit. When it comes to vocals on this album, Anastacia has shown that less is definitely more.  <br /> <br />Track Listing:  <br /> <br />1.) Seasons Change: Probably the weakest song on the album, but it definitely keeps you awake with it's aggressive rock sound. This is a very empowering song. <br /> <br />2.) Left Outside Alone: This song is a fantastic dramatic power ballad. The lyrics are very melancholy and this is definitely one of those \\"sad\\" songs that make you feel happy. What is even more incredible is the fact of Anastacia's voice being so toned down in this song that It's difficult to believe it's even her singing until the song progresses. This is by far one of the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />3.) Time: This song is simply about how you can't take time for granted. The beat leans strongly to the side of rock which I think is definitely Anastacia's niche.  <br /> <br />4.) Sick And Tired: I don't really get the Jamaican sound to her voice in this song, but the lyrics are so phenomenally great that you forget that tiny annoyance.  <br /> <br />5.) Heavy on my Heart: This heart wrenching ballad is another one of this album's highlights. The chorus is very infectiously sad and Anastacia's vocals are extremely intense.  <br /> <br />6.) I Do: This song features Sonny of P.O.D and is very reminiscent of Evanescence's \\"Bring Me To Life.\\" This is probably the only song that really sounds like anything Evanescence has done, so for those of you who have read the other reviews and are expecting this album to be like an Evanescence album than don't.  <br /> <br />7.) Welcome to my Truth: This song starts off very slow almost as if it were a ballad, but then the tempo changes and Anastacia rocks out. This song is yet another song about overcoming hard times.  <br /> <br />8.) Pretty Little Dum Dum: From the beginning of this song you simply can't skip over this track. As Anastacia sings unnecessary syllables such as \\"padapapapa,\\" you are just dragged in by it's cuteness. Although this song is not about cuteness, it's about overcoming being a man's \\"Pretty Little Dum Dum.\\" <br /> <br />9.) Sexy Single: This is probably the only song on this album that is reminiscent of her previous albums. Her vocals aren't as toned down on this song as the others on this album. This song is very pop sounding. <br /> <br />10.) Rearview: This is a very beautiful song and I think it has single potential. Somewhat reminiscent of the scorn Kelly Clarkson shows on her latest album. <br /> <br />11.) Where do I belong: This track starts off very slow and then builds up to a more up-tempo angry track. As Anastacia sings in this song her voice just sounds so sad and tormented. It's a pleasant song to listen to because you can really feel her emotion. <br /> <br />12.) Maybe Today: This is yet another ballad; however, it's really great and her voice sounds as if it more on the tormented side than the pleasant emotionless pop sound. It's a very deep and powerful track. A great track to end on. <br /> <br />This is by far Anastacia's best album and it's sad that she needed such tragedy in her life to produce something this immaculate. This album is full of scorn, angry, and overcoming alternative rock tracks that are similar to the likes of Kelly Clarkson. I think this album could really be her breakthrough album in the US, but untilthen, don't miss out on this masterpiece.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|This is a very enjoyable band in most peoples opinions. You don't hear many people saying anything bad about this band it seems, which is a good thing because they are a great band. I haven't heard their music before the Stevie Nicks days much. Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie is what really made this band shine and get ratings. I'm not really big on McVie though, I tend to like the Nicks songs more by quite a bit. McVie's songs are the weakest songs I've heard from Fleetwood Mac. \\"Brown Eyes\\" on the other hand is a great Christine McVie song.<br /><br />Enough said for now... Rating each song time. 10=Great, 9=Really Good, 8=Good, 7=Pretty Good<br /><br />Over and Over(7.5) The Ledge(10) Think About Me(9.0) Save Me a Place(9.5) Sara(10) What Makes You Think You're the One(9.5) Storms(9.0) That's All for Everyone(9.5) Not That Funny Is It(10) Sisters of the Moon(10) Angel(9.5) That's Enough For Me(9.5) Brown Eyes(10) Never Make Me Cry(7.0) I Know I'm Not Wrong(9.5)Honey Hi(8.0) Beautiful Child(8.5) Walk a Thin Line(9.5) Tusk(10) Never Forget (7.5)<br /><br />This is my favorite Fleetwood Mac album since it's full of songs I enjoy which are nice and diverse, upbeat and dark at times. I love diversity in any album. Rumours is a great album as well, but I go for the albums with a nice quantity as well as good quality of songs. One album I do like, but is not one of my favorites with many songs and good ones, is Exile on Mainstreet. It just isn't one of my favorite albums that contain a heavy load of songs like the great White Album, Tommy, Quadrophenia, The Who Sell Out, Electric Lady Land or in this case Tusk.
B00080EU58|1.0|So this is the stuff you Backstreet Boys bashers have the adacity to tell me I should be liking over the \\"no-talent\\" and \\"losers\\" that you claim the Backstreet Boys to be?<br /><br />Let me tell you it does not take \\"talent\\" or \\"creativity\\" to throw a temper tantrum!  You know a lot of people carry baggage from their childhood, failed relationships and such but writing a bunch of \\"Woe-is-me\\" stuff does not take talent.  Nor does making your instruments sound loud and obnoxious.<br /><br />As for telling me what I SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT listen to, you do not have any ground to stand on.  At least Backstreet Boys do not complain on record about how bad life is or how they have it bad.  Are Slipknot making money?  Good so they DON'T HAVE it bad!  Yes we want honesty but again, honesty does not require a temper tantrum.<br /><br />I am not going to say that you Slipknot fans need to listen to the Backstreet Boys - HEAVEN FORBID!  On the same token, don't tell us Backstreet Boys fans that we are less of a person, gay or losers because we would rather listen to music that helps us deal with our issues, not wallow in them!<br /><br />As of August 27th:<br />\\"2 of 16 people found the following review helpful:\\"<br /><br />YEAH!

B000A59PMO|5.0|In my almost 28 years of watching (and being addicted to) television, I had NEVER written to a network's executives to thank them for a job well-done. Veronica Mars swooped in and changed all that.  <br /> <br />This is just a fantasticly written, stellarly performed dramedy. The actors are given incredible material to work with each week and the cast (led by the fiercely talented Kristen Bell) makes the material sparkle. There's not a bad egg in the bunch. Kristen Bell deserves all the praise she has received -- and then some--there aren't many actors who have chemistry with everyone they're put onscreen with, yet she does! <br /> <br />And let's not forget the supporting players. Three in particular stand-out for me:  <br /> <br />Jason Dohring (as Logan Echolls) has the uncanny ability to make you want to slap him, hug him, laugh at him, laugh with him and just basically stand in awe of his performance in every scene--no matter how small. This guy isn't another run-of-the-mill Hollywood prettyboy out to see his picture plastered on movie posters. You can tell how dedicated he is to his craft--he simply oozes talent. <br /> <br />Enrico Colantoni (as Keith Mars) does a terrific job playing Veronica's father and former town Sheriff. His offbeat humor made me hestitant at first but very soon I came to love every scene he was in.  <br /> <br />Francis Capra (as Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro) has yet to get as much screen time as I'd like. But I am impressed with his ability to take a fairly \\"vanilla\\" scene and twist it and turn it to make it his own. It takes a deft performer to make his 3-minute scene more memorable than the plot's \\"A\\" story! <br /> <br />Oh, I love every one of them--even the recurring characters! But I'll stop there. Bottomline: If you enjoy quality television where everyone in front of and behind the camera clearly is at the \\"top of their game\\" then buy this DVD AND don't forget to watch the second season this fall on UPN--Wednesdays at 9pm. Veronica Marsepitomizes appointment television! <br /> <br />
B00009UW0N|5.0|One of the best suspense movies ever made (not necessarily horror although that's its label).<br /><br />Obviously the fact that this movie was filmed on $300,000 and ultimately went on to rake in millions gives much hype to the movie, but the financial success aside, this particular movie, more so than any other horror/thriller, has held my top spot on my list of favorites for the genre.<br /><br />Horror and suspense is subjective and different people are frightened by different things.  The one fear inducing characteristic of this movie is exactly what others have said didnt like about the killer- he doesnt do anything.  Thats the whole point- Its the suspense angle (M Night Shalyman, Hitchcock, Euro horror/ thriller directors,etc.) that what the audience doesnt see on the screen is in fact scarier than what they can see on the screen.  Thats why Michael Myers is called \\"The Shape\\".... to leave the possibilities of the imagination a little more open ended instead of taking the gore route or something more direct.  However, I think Michael Myers does plenty to induce chills and Im glad that there isnt a bunch of gore in this film, or dialogue from the killer- leaves way more up to the imagination.<br /><br />Another intersting tidbit about this movie that Carpenter has talked about is that this movie was also mislabeled as a big gore splatterfest....when in fact there is virtually no \\"splatter\\"- very little blood and only 1 killing shot.  Again it all goes back to Carpenter's style and how he tries in this film to scare by creating moods that dont spell everything out by dumbing everything down (like Aviator or your typical flavor of the month Hollywood crapfest that requires every scene to be active and filled with props to appease the American masses).<br /><br />The story is basic and simple but its setting, Halloween Night, is anything but basic- what can be more powerful and fantastical than staging a thriller on Halloween night?  If your a fan of the huanted house motif, there are lots of images in this film that deliver.<br /><br />Carpenter's music, as another poster has indicated, is also a big componet of his effective style-  He is a dynamic musician that scores many of his own films.  If youve never seen Escape From New York, the Fog, or Halloween, he uses lots of synthesizers and bass heavy techno beats that create a forbodding atmosphere- totally effective and Im not even a techno fan.  He was doing techno before there was techno probably.<br /><br />The commentary is refreshing on the special edition as both Carpenter and Debra Hill come across as intelligent, creative, and enthusiastic.  Ive only watched the commentary haflway thru though (even though Ive seen Halloween probably 50 times off and on) so I cant comment on everyone else but I have rolled my eyes when Jamie Lee Curtis starts talking about herself (no one cares)- hopefully she will add something interesting later.<br /><br />Lots of social commentary and dialogue has been created as the result of this film and regardless how scary, good, or bad people think this film is it has cemented itself in the history of one of the most important films of our time.huanted house motif, there are lots of images in this film that deliver. <br /> <br />Carpenter's music, as another poster has indicated, is also a big componet of his effective style-  He is a dynamic musician that scores many of his own films.

0446608955|5.0|Landon & Jamie love for each other builds slowly and deepens until you can almost feel it. The plot and characters seemed fresh, the pace was quick, and it was a totally engrossing read. This book had great dialog, plot, background characters & character development. This book was a pleasure to read and I couldn't put it down until it was finished.<br /><br />A romance from an author who has the ability to break down his characters souls and feed their emotional struggles onto the pages. The reader will feel the despair, the heartbreak, passion and the joy of Landon & Jamie in this very excellent character driven romance. I when finished this book and I can barely see through all the tears. Yes, this is just that kind of story. There are love stories and then there are just amazing, totally emotionally written love stories.<br /><br /> I finished this book in a day and told everyone about it. This book gave goose bumps while I read it because the story became live and felt so real. I love how Sparks puts a story together. This story is sweet and wonderful. Landon Carter & Jamie Sullivan are apart of my heart now. One the sweetest love story ever told.
B000002572|4.0|Boston's best was their first.  This album had a profound effect on me as a youth in the 1970's.  This is anything but \\"junk rock.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002IU988|4.0|Theres a few good songs.  I dont like all of them.  I thought some of them could have been a little better.
B00005RYLE|5.0|I first saw this film way back in the mid 80s while I was much younger and couldnt appreciate the creativity, pain, and outright wildness of how this movie was made. <br /> <br />Basically just a handful of creative kids with no money going nuts and among other things, doing all their own stunts, firing off real shotguns in to real glass directly in front of their real faces. <br /> <br />Although I havent seen too many dvds with commentary, Evil Dead with the 2 different commentary tracks is the best Ive seen yet as the director, producer, and actor all give non stop insight and depth about the film instead of just rehashing whats going on on the screen ala book report style like some commentary does.   <br /> <br />Im not involved in the film industry but after watching the cast and crew romp thru this challenging production (that took a few years) it reminded me of some of the times when I was younger, totally in my element and focused working on projects also with reckless abandon. <br /> <br />For those that havent seen it....It is low budge, gory, action packed, interestingly filmed (odd angles and movements with the camera), classic mythological story, and has an intriguing soundtrack.  Dont expect the gloss of your typical flavor of the month multi million dollar Hollywood FX film though as this is not that type of movie. <br /> <br />I enjoyed Bruce Campbell's commentary as he had a lot to say (unlike Kurt Russel in the Thing commenetry that couldnt even remember most of the movie), came across as sharp, witty, and funny.  The commenatry by the director and producer was also well done and delivers. <br /> <br />Horror and gore aside, if someone is interested in rags to riches stories as they relate to creating films and if one also wants to peer into the unglamourous and tediuos side of making films than the Evil Dead Special Edition may be worth it. <br /> <br />
B000002JS6|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the best AC/DC album, and that is saying a LOT. This is pure rock 'n' roll. I love almost every song on this album...Angus and Malcom Young are GODS. Brian Johnson does a great job too. This is the album that convinced me that AC/DC was one of the greatest bands ever. From the insane guitar to catchy beats to great and sexual lyrics...this is truly rock 'n' roll. My favs off this album are What Do You Do for Money Honey, Back in Black, Shoot to Thrill, and Hell's Bells.
B00009W0WM|5.0|CASABLANCA is rightfully recognized as one of the best films ever made. To me, it is the best film ever made. It has a bit of everything which can be a recipe for disaster but, in this case, it all comes together to work a miracle. <br /> <br />It is not your regular war movie. It takes place at the opening of World War II and involves themes and current events from that war but the war is not the star. It is merely the reason that these people find themselves together in the North African town of Casablanca. <br /> <br />It is not an action movie although there are a few shootouts, chases and the like. They are a needed part of the story. When the Nazis or their agents come to get you, you run and they shoot. <br /> <br />It is not a comedy although some of the greatest comic lines in all of cinema are found in this gem. \\"Round up the usual suspects!\\" <br /> <br />It is not a musical although the music is an integral part of the film. It plays a minor but important part. \\"As Time Goes By\\" was a decade old when this film came out and was never a hit until this film. Now you cannot help but think of this film without thinking of that song. <br /> <br />It is not a love story in the traditional sense. There is a romantic story. Two men love the same woman. She loves them both. The ending is a bit of a surprise and you want to cry for the loser all the while understanding why he gave her up. <br /> <br />This film is all of these things and none of them. It merely is. <br /> <br />It takes place in the North African town of Casablanca which has been flooded by refuges from the German onslaught. Bogart plays Rick, the owner of a saloon who does very well for himself. The town is controlled by Vichy French and the prefect of police is a lovable cad played by Claude Raines. Two refugees, one an escapee from a concentration camp, come to Rick's trying to procure an exit visa that will allow them to escape to safety. The Nazis don't want them to have it. One of the refugeesis Ilse, played beautifully by Ingrid Bergman. She was Rick's lover in Paris until that city fell to the Germans. They were going to go away together and then she disappeared, only to turn up married to the other refugee, a famous critic of the Nazis, Tensions are high all around emotions are running even stronger. Someone has to lose. <br /> <br />This DVD edition has plenty of special features for fans. There are some outtakes and deleted scenes from the original movie and plenty of interviews as well as commentaries. Don't buy it for these, however. By it for the glory that is CASABLANCA. <br />
0385474547|5.0|I was required to read this book a total of three times in the same year when I started college. The first time around  although it was an easy and interesting book, I thought it was about something I would never be able to relate to. I don't live in Africa and I don't belong to a tribe. I was wondering why I was being forced into reading this book three times. Now as many years have passed since college, I still think back about this terrific book. I realize that the book can be applied to my life as in the fact that yes, things in life do fall apart and it is how you cope with it. I don't know if other people got that from this book, but it is a great read and if you let it simmer and ponder what it has to say, I hope you can find the benefits from it like I did.
0765309408|1.0|this book has gotten teriffic reviews, and the reason for this escapes me.  'infantile'  is the best description, not even rising to 'adolescent'.  save your money on this wretched crap.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|\\"America, f-yeah!\\" kept running thru my head for days after seeing \\"Team America,\\" a catchy little tune that brings up the same feelings the movie did. One the one hand I loved the satire, and found the puppet sex and puke scenes painfully funny. On the other hand, I was a little uneasy about what I was laughing at: a partially digested stew of Hollywood cliches, conservative pieties and liberal silliness--yikes, I was laughing at MYSELF! This is a profound anti-American film, and should be seen by anyone over 21, and MANDATORY for anyone under 21. Now I've got to be sick...
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Prog funk latin jazz punk rock. Omar Rodriguez-Lopez's unpredictable speaking in tongues guitar. Cedric Bixler-Zavala's dark haunting wails. Jon Theodore's thunderous rymthatic drums. Jaun Alderte's dance inspring base. Marcel Rodriguez-Lopez's percussion. The diary of a schizoprenhic in search of his lost parents AND the death of Jemery Ward, belovedsound manipulator...and about 1,000 other sounds, inspirations, influences, and the like. The list is endless. <br /> <br /> <br />When all is said and done, The Mars Volta and Frances The Mute are a unique experience unlike any other, one that goes beyond any sort of summary or explanation. If you possess the ability to think your yourself, admire originality, and wish to escape the depths of commercial mainstream hell, then by all means by this album, listen to it repeatedly, and tell all you friends to do the same. Otherwise, go buy a Blink 182 album and crawl back into the bubble.
1400043662|5.0|Mysterious and meandering, \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" pulls you from the first pages and takes you for a very unsettling ride. Haruki Murakami works his usual genius at creating characters with familiar and compelling conflicts, and effortlessly pulling the reader into the erotically charged setting of modern Japan. \\"Kafka\\" introduces some new elements in a focus on a rural landscape and some shocking and incomprehensible violence. In all, an excellent and challenging read that will take places you've never been before, and may not want to visit again. <br />  <br />
B000001Y2U|5.0|I still remember when Antichrist Superstar was released upon the masses. It caused parents to take notice of who they believed to be Satan's new messenger, Marilyn Manson. As a kid at the time, I absolutely adored this album and I still do! The songs are just as fresh as they were almost twenty years ago when it came out. It is hard to believe that it has almost been that long ago. The music and lyrics are both unforgettable and I can still remember these lyrics even if I haven't heard the song in a couple of years. They are dark, brooding and just awesome
B00001SIES|5.0|Muse started with a bang. \\"Showbiz\\" is one of the best debuts in history, Muse where already playing TOP NOTCH, i can understand why comparisions are made with Radiohead, both bands are technically great, write great songs and have a singer that can hit really high notes. (May I call Jeff Buckley the inspirator for both?). But Radiohead's debut \\"pablo honey\\" isn't even CLOSE to the level of OK Computer and Kid A. Muse already played beautifully here. <br />Just listen to the first track \\"Sunburn\\", starts of with piano and then it justs blasts off. \\"Muscle Museum\\" has one of the most awesome basslines ive ever heard. \\"Unintended\\" is a beautiful ballad.  <br />I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ONLY 3 GUYS IN THIS BAND.... YES THREE !!!!! AND THEY PLAY THIS LIVE JUST LIKE ON THE CD!!! <br /> <br />Sorry, had to let it out...
B000001Y5X|4.0|Ah, before the birth of the Antichrist, Mr. Manson dropped the \\"Spooky Kids\\" name and released \\"Portrait\\". This album has some pretty good songs on it, but none compare to his later stuff, \\"Wrapped in Plastic\\", \\"Lunch Box\\" and \\"Dope Hat\\" being his three best songs on this record. Like I said, this record is before he came into his best, but it's still a great record from the one who would later become one of the biggest Rock stars ever.
B0002OERI0|5.0|It's hard to begin describing a record that changed the way I approach and think about music and perhaps, even life. I got American Idiot the 3rd day after its release at my local shop and I couldn't wait to hear it. The only track I knew was American Idiot, and although I though it was really awesome, I didn't have a clue of the quality of music I was holding in my hands. From the intro of \\"American Idiot\\" through the fast paced \\"St. Jimmy\\" to the last chord of \\"Whatsername\\" I just fell in love with this CD. Before I tell you what I think about each song, you should know that I never really had been a Green Day fan, although I had purchased International Superhits! For me, American Idiot was like Dookie for those who where my age (12) at that time: it changed my life. So here are the songs: <br /> <br />1. American Idiot- **4/5** Needless to say, this is the first single, and it is a really good song. Explosive from beginning to end, with one simple riff and an amazing video, gave us an idea of what AI would be like. Not my favourite but still good. <br /> <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia- **5/5** What can I say about this song? It's amazing: perfect. I never heard anything like this, I just can't describe it. Rebellious and full of angst, the best 9 minute song on the record. It keeps you guessing of what is coming next. This is my 2nd favourite song. <br /> <br />3. Holiday. **6/5** This song...for me, its like Basket Case for a hell lot of people, or even like Anarchy in the UK. I hope no one hates me for comparing Green Day to the Sex Pistols, because I'm not, it's just that this song had that much of an impact on. Full of \\"lets kill Bush\\" lyrics with probably some of the best guitar work Green Day has ever done and my favourite solo in the CD. My favourite Green Day song EVER! <br /> <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams- **4.5-5** This was the 2nd single for the record and I love it. I feel like it's a song that you can really relate to, because it sort of about being alone and possibly going through sh*t all by yourself. I forgot to say that I love the guitar in all of the record, but Boulevard is another of my favourite guitar parts.  <br /> <br />5. Are We The Waiting- **3.5-5** This song isn't the best in the record. It basically a repetitive guitar riff, some nice verses and an extremely repetive chorus, (\\"Are we are, are we are the waiting unknown. Like 5 times) It is however, a good song and its not really a downer.  <br /> <br />6. St. Jimmy- **4.5-5** Okay...this song. Really fast paced, rebellious and amazing. Again I find myself without the words to describe the quality of this song.  <br /> <br />7. Give Me Novacaine- **4.0-5** This is another of the slow-paced songs in the record and I always relate it to Are We The Waiting, however, this is a LOT better. As someone else said, its pretty familiar and quite catchy. Really good. <br /> <br />8. She's A Rebel- **4.5-5** Read my review for St Jimmy. Oh, and add \\"Some of the coolest lyrics in a song about a girl I've ever heard, and that's saying something.\\" <br /> <br />9. Extraordinary Girl-**4.9-5** This song is also slow-paced and I know a lot of people don't like this song and say that the lyrics don't match. However, this was one of my favourite songs since the first time I heard the record and I love the Chorus. The only reason why I don't give it a 5 is the intro. <br /> <br />10. Letterbomb- **5-5** For me, this is were the end of the best record ever (again, my opinion only, don't get p*ssed off) starts. Letterbomb is a song that left get gasping for air, fast paced and truly outstanding and catchy.  <br /> <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends- **5-5** I think I stopped breathing when I heard this song. It has an amazing guitar, lyrics that could make you cry, a great rhythm and that extra GD touch that makes my favourites. This is the latest single. I hope it doesn't get overplayed, because it is so amazing. <br /> <br />12. Homecoming- **4-5** The other9 minute song in the record, and the one I like the least. Its amazingly good, don't get me wrong, its just that not even Green Day could write 9 minutes as amazing as JOS. I most admit I get a little bored halfway through this song sometimes, but its not that I don't love it. <br /> <br />13. Whatsername- **5-5** One of my favourite songs. I think this grew on me, because I didn't really like it when I first heard it. It's pretty nostalgic but not cheesy...a great way to end the record. <br /> <br />Those were all the songs. AI got me obsessed with Green Day, and now I own every single record and B-Side and I can play every single song from American Idiot in guitar and bass. That's why I can tell you, that why I can bet MY LIFE, that you, your son, your dad, your grandmother, ANYONE IS GOING TO LOVE THIS RECORD. What are you waiting for!!?? Say this review was helpful and go buy AI! <br />
B00000AFGM|5.0|I've been a Manson fan for seven years, in other words, Mechanical Animals was my first Manson album. I'm one of the people who really try to defend this record against those who don't like it. It was a fresh look upon the Marilyn Manson character, as they said at the time; we've seen Manson-now it's time to see Marilyn.<br /><br />This album is full of great songs that even now I consider to be some of his best songs. So if you ever hear negative about this album, don't believe it. As people here already say in their reviews, this album is totally worth getting. But don't expect anything like Antichrist, it's a completely different, and that's not a bad thing.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|What can I say; Wow!<br /><br />This is what Priest fans have been waiting for now for many years. This release balances both hard core sound with a bit of pop, yet keeps the total package in check. Rob's voice while clearly older stil sounds as any fan will remember. The guitars, drums, dbl leads...it's all there and damn; it sounds good! This release is on par with British Steel. Later albums had more pop metal hits and were good but some of the roots metal sound had been lost. Here's it back loud and clear. And not as hard as songs like Ram it Down was were the band seemed to struggle. They all needed a break and now years later all's right in the world again!<br /><br />I'm hard pressed to name a favorite tune; Deal with the Devil, Revolution...but maybe Worth Fighting For... what a geat song.<br /><br />Older listners will enjoy this, younger ones will want to buy old albums just to see what this was all about way back when!
B00003CXAE|4.0|Grease is a great movie.  Dancing and singing w/ the movie.  It is so much fun to watch.
0792841859|3.0|Having just followed the court case of one of the actual perpetrators I was a bit puzzled at the mixture of facts and fiction. Plus I thought the FBI came through as the Hollywood glossed heroes whereas local black people were sketchy nonpeople. Pity. But maybe that does say something about the time when the movie was made, only 20-some years after the actual events.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah carey did her best with this cd!!! She has lyrics that so powerful in some songs like, we belong together, and mine again.My favorite songs on this cd are: Its like that, We belong together, Shake it off, Mine again, and, Get your number. I bought this cd just yesterday and, already 5 are my favorite songs, but, I havent even listened to the rest of this cd so, im sure im going to have a lot more favorites soon. I highly reccomend this cd to any fans of mariah or, soon to be fans, because, this is truly a great cd!!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon totally out did himself w/ this sci-fi western creation.  It's a total shame the the network didn't give it a chance.  Each episode is full of great plot, action, witty humor, and amazing costumes.  You will easily fall in love w/ each character wanting to know more.  This is by far an amazing cult classic w/ a large fan following.
B0002N4ZEW|4.0|This is the wrong album for introducing yourself to Porcupine Tree; I'd go first to the compilation \\"Stars Die: The Delerium Years\\" or \\"Deadwing\\" for that purpose. However, once you're into the band, it's a must-own component of the back-catalogue. <br /> <br />Ya gotta love the sheer audacity of the concept: To provide a 64-minute soundtrack for a head trip. There are only four tracks, all of which are lengthy and bear no resemblance to typical song structures. They just meander all over the place, held together by a lick lifted directly from \\"The Wall\\" and interspersed snippets of dialogue from people who have taken LSD (or the researchers monitoring them). I enjoy Phase I the best, and it will be familiar to those who own \\"Stars Die,\\" but this is not the kind of album you put on to hear individual tracks. It's not an album at all, in the traditional sense, but it is a concept album in the very best sense, one that would almost certainly make Pink Floyd proud. <br />
0393312836|3.0|i never realized that until i read the other reviews.  <br /> <br />i was going  to give this 1 star but i read another customer review that says that the point was \\"one should grow up and take responsibility for one's actions, or get shock therapy\\". if that's the case, it's pretty good for a book of its length. i don't find \\"is it better to be good by force, or to be bad by choice?\\" (supposedly the question it wants to raise) stirring. sounds like a topic for a junior high debate. <br />
0679735259|5.0|Always the creative and morbid kid, I did an audio-production book report project in eighth grade using Michael Herr's Dispatches. It was as gritty as I could make it without getting in trouble, and my faux-adult voiceovers were clearly Apocalypse Now-influenced. <br />It started with my dad recommending the book to me. I'm thankful. It changed the way I thought about most everything, left me wandering around in a cloud of (likely overwrought) psychedelic profundity. This may have been my ultimate watershed book. It is the best work ever written on Vietnam, or any war--really, on the theme of war itself. The narrative is shocking, sublime, moving, hugely influential to all subsequent war media...here is a hellish and uniquely troubling conflict as seen through the lens of a gonzo journalist extraordinare. I am on my third copy now, having thoroughly busted up the other two. Read it if you're a thinking human being. <br />Thanks, Pops.
B00005QDW5|3.0|I've been a Floyd fan for years... and have spent hours upon hours with every album.  I must say that Floyd albums are the type of ones that you are SUPPOSED to listen to from beginning to end... skipping nothing along the way - they're stories. <br /> <br />You wouldn't skip 50 pages in your favorite book... would you? <br /> <br />Though I appreciate the compilation of their \\"greatest hits,\\" I found myself dissapointed... every time a song ended I kept catching myself expecting the next song on its respective album... <br /> <br />I DO appreciate this album... but it should be the type of album bought by someone just getting started with the band, not by an enthusiast - especially for the price.   <br /> <br />Just buy all their albums... you won't be sorry.
B00004RJ74|5.0|It's hard to do much original with vampires after literally hundreds of films featuring the creatures, including excellent picks like \\"Near Dark\\" and \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\", but \\"From Dusk 'Til Dawn\\" is one of a few over the last decade that's injected fresh, vibrant blood into the always popular vampire subgenre, and has helped keep it a healthy subsection of the horror field. <br /> <br />   With great performances from an excellent cast that includes George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Salma Hayak, Quentin Tarantino, Ernest Liu, Tom Savini and Kelly Preston, it's odd in that for almost the whole first half of the movie there's no indication at all that you're seeing a horror movie.  What you've got is a superb suspense thriller/whacked-out crime drama about two convicts (Clooney and Tarantino) abducting a family in their motorhome to make a getaway down to Mexico.  When the horror elements come in, they don't creep in gradually but kick in the proverbial door howling for blood, driven by some of the best monster effects ever seen.  I don't know if this kind of pacing would work in a lot of movies, but it was extremely potent here.  A fantastic horror movie that, because of its superstar cast, has the potential to draw new fans into the entire genre.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|This album is pretty much a joke- with rip offs left and right- uninspired crap, nothing new- this album leaves nothing to be liked. I feel like this band is going downhill fast, and they're taking their fans with them...but hey, Im not following this crap train any longer!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer is their finest offering to date.     The bizzare concept album about computers taking over and dehumanizing us people is as good as it is confusing.    Thom Yorke sings his heart out on each grand track that embodies one of the most brilliant albums of recent memory: the excellent first single Paranoid Android, the gripping Bob Dylan borrowed title Subterranean Homesick Alien, the sad and elusive Let Down and Exit Music (For A Film), the hard hitting and amazing hit single Karma Police, the sentimental No Surprises, the computerized spoken track Fitter Happier, and the rocking Climbing Up The Walls.    Whatever the band were intending to say with the title of the album, all you have to know is that this 'computer' is beyond OK, it's a classic!    Recommended    A
6305657947|5.0|I usually do not like remakes, but John McTiernan's 1999 version of \\"The Thomas Crown Affair,\\" with the \\"oh so sexy\\" Pierce Brosnan, and sultry Renee Russo, (women definitely notice mega-sex appeal in another woman), is a knock-out escapist film. Many may disagree with me, but I enjoyed it more than the original 1968 movie with Steve McQueen, who I love, and Faye Dunaway. Ms Dunaway does have a cameo role here as Crown's therapist<br /><br />This is entertainment, with a capital \\"E,\\" at its best. Nothing deep, or arty, but after a hard day's work, relatively mindless fun is frequently good - even terrific! Thomas Crown, (Brosnan), please allow me to repeat myself, is drop-dead sexy, handsome, rich as Croesus, an expert businessman, cultured, exudes power in a nice-guy (but nevertheless ruthless) kinda way, and he's Available!! I won't go on, but you get the picture. However, as a man who has almost everything, Crown wants some more excitement in his life. He plans, so cleverly, to steal a priceless Monet painting from New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Of course he succeeds. Watching the brilliant execution of the theft is worth the price of the rental alone. Crown loves the painting - but he loves the challenge of acquiring it more.<br /><br />Enter the glorious Ms. Russo, called Catherine Banning here. She is a tough, insurance investigator who, as far as pushovers go, was not born yesterday. I read that Russo actually consulted with a professional dominatrix in order to prepare for her role as the aggressive, ever so seductive Ms. Banning. She zeros in on Crown in no time, while turning the NYPD detective heading the case into quivering Jello. He notices, by the way, that apart from being a super detective, she's really easy on the eyes.<br /><br />There are capers - the first one and the last, (with a touch of Magritte), are best. There is love. There's even a remarkable see-through dress, which moves with the body wearing it, to a hot Latin beat; a steamy scene on a staircase; and a fabulous, must-have soundtrack. Most importantly, in a film like this one, the chemistry between Russo and Brosnan is unbelievably outrageous! As in comedy, timing in love and sex is everything - and the timing here is perfect. Both control freaks lose their cool. I must say that everything is done tastefully, with lots of humor. The script is intelligent and witty.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie. It's a terrific date flick too!<br />JANAase; and a fabulous, must-have soundtrack. Most importantly, in a film like this one, the chemistry between Russo and Brosnan is unbelievably outrageous!

B0007CNXUK|5.0|Johnny Depp was perfectly cast in Finding Neverland, and the children showed acting ability beyond their ages. At times I had difficulty believing Kate Winslet's proformance, but I was still crying by the end.
1593640064|5.0|Excellent read for those interested in political philosophy, history or psychology.  The only complaint I have is that the typeface is tiny.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Now, ill admit first off that i did download this about a month ago, but will buy it as soon as i have the money(i only wish i had the money now so i could get one w/the superman cover) But none of this matters, this CD is one of the three great modern albums. Which include Ok Computer, In The Aeroplane Over The Sea, and of course, Illinois. this album is soperfect together as an album, and as you listen to it more you find that each and every song is as wonderful as the album as a whole. For example, when i first heard the album, only one of the songs stuck out at me, and forced me to listen to it over and over, that song is: Chicago. But after more listens of the whole album i slowly started to love, Casamir Pulaski Day, then The Predatory Wasps..., and so on and so forth.  <br /> <br /> Sufjan's voice, and song writing abilities shine through a lot better on this album, because he was allowed and allowed himself to do a lot more. To use more instruments, and try new arrangements. The result is a beautiful album with music so good it could be on Broadway. Golly...i think if everyone actually listened to the album there is no way that everyone could not love it. <br /> <br />Sorry about the spelling mistakes. <br /> <br />GODBLESS <br /> <br />-Nicholas
0066620996|4.0|If you enjoyed the book Built to Last, you will find more inspirational insights and useful concepts in Good to Great.  This book explains how eleven companies went from being good companies to great companies.  Good to Great identifies the similarities between the eleven companies and uses this information to create a model for good to great.  This book highlights the importance of discipline within an organization: disciplined people, disciplined though, and disciplined action.  Within this discipline, the reader learns the importance of leadership, strategy, and technology- not the pre-canned explanations, but truly innovative and applicable concepts.  This book focuses on the conceptual, rather than the factual.  Jim Collins presens the information as a look back rather than as a scientific study.  This style keeps the book easy to read, inspirational, and idealistic.
1573223026|2.0|Nick Hornby phoned it on this one. Hard to believe this book came from the same author who penned High Fidelity and About a Boy. Premise was silly, characters were immensely unlikable (nothing new for Hornby), and story wasn't nearly as funny as his earlier work. Save your money!
0880794968|5.0|This was not just another clone of the classic pack. It is as if the illustrators original intention were upgraded to perfection! Ms Coleman-Smith must be proud where ever she is! These images are probably the most common for anyone seeing the Tarot for the first time. I remember picking up the original in 1986. I was afraid and interested at the same time.     Now, all these years and decks later, this wonderful edition appears. Perusing it, I felt an old freind reborn. I felt hurt and ashamed that there are individuals out there who would use this wonderful tool to profit off and harm others! So I began reading publicly again in 2002. This deck can revive faith and trust in my clients.    Not only are these cards to be used for professional readings, they are great for meditation and pathworking. The reinterpretation of the color scheme makes this very effective on all accounts. Gone are many fears and superstions associated with the history of this deck. The mysteries are still there for those of you who favor this.     Mary Hanson-Roberts has another pack out there that is as faithful to this edition. However, I feel this deck is superior in many ways. Many use the mystical power of color in a reading. I cannot recommend a more conducive deck for this purpose.     Beginners take note, the booklet included has all standard meanings associated with this system. It is like learning musical notes before you can compose your symphony. Very important!  Then develop your skills further by actually reading for family and friends. Who know what could be in store for you! Most importantly, keep your sense of humor.     If necessary, move on to another deck to suite your style. There are many to pick from, so if this is not your style, try something more suited to yourself. There are many instrument in an orchestra. This is one of the truest methods for developing intuitive or psychic skills! If this does not work for you at first, set it aside and come back to it later!If I could give this ten stars, I would! Tarot is evolving from a superstitious fortune telling device, to the ever loyal assistant to the skilled counselor! This interpretation is where many begin! Think, feel and intuition can begin to show.
0060989157|5.0|What can I say? This is one of the most compulsively readable things I have ever cuddled up with! I was done with this book in less than two days and wanted more when it was over. It is funny because I usually get accused of being something of a book snob because I am partial to literary fiction and classics. However, because I was a giant Motley Crue (Nikki Sixx) fan growing up in the 80s, I thought I would give this book a shot. I was absolutely blown away and there was not one paragraph in the whole 400+ pages that wasn't fascinating. I was almost depressed when it was over because I felt almost as though I had to say goodbye to four friends. These guys went through some serious hell and somehow managed to live through it. This book made me laugh, shake my head in disbelief, and even cry in a few places. It is quite the rollercoaster ride.<br />I cannot imagine anyone not absolutely loving this book. Undoubtedly I will buy my own brand spanking new copy and read it again and again...It's that good!
1572810408|5.0|There seems to be nothing short of a warm summer afternoon to describe this deck. I particularly like this Tarot in that regard. It is true, there are not a lot of occult, mystical references here but it is very user friendly by client standards.  <br />  <br />Many decks scream at clients as the cards are turned.  This is not one of them. The subtle tones and warm colors lend to this calm feel-a big plus for many who have had customers squirm at various decks.  I would recommend this for kids as well. The images are obvious, but not threatening. Ms Kneen illustrates for childrens books as well. <br /> <br />I use this deck for folks who have stressful issues facing them. The colors are soothing, yet the images are not too soft. This deck has a very agrarian feel to it. Many of the minor trumps depict pastoral scenes, which could be used for folks asking about gardening or farming. Do not feel limited to this purpose alone! In skilled hands, this deck can be consulted on all issues. <br /> <br />Many reviewers here and elsewhere had said this Tarot lacks something. Occult references, I believe, were left out on purpose. The overall feel of the deck becons one back to the Middle ages.  I could see this as being as an intermediate deck for someone who has had some experience with this particular system of divination. The Tarot is not for everyone to read. It is a fine art, that needs many years of practice to perfect.
0859652777|5.0|I have always been a huge Manson fan, much to the chagrin of my family and friends. What I've found is that too many people find it easier to label someone a freak as opposed to really getting to understand the man behind the stage facade. Manson is not only a marketing genius, but a well-spoken and thoughtfully educated individual. The thing I loved about this book and reading about Manson's life is that it has just the shock factor one would suspect, but also reveals a regular person who grew up as a KISS nerd to become one of America's most talked about rock stars. THis was a straight through read and even my somewhat conservative husband loved it. The only book of this kind that can even compete is \\"The Dirt\\" (about Motley Crue) which was also co written with Neil Strauss and highly recommended.<br />All I can say is that one should never judge a book by its cover alone (literally or figuratively). I recommend this book to Manson fans for sure, but moreso to those who think they know what a \\"pathetic freak\\" he is.<br />Also, a word of advice for those who like to be quick judges: Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see!
B0002IQHZM|5.0|I have spent the last year of my life falling in love with Donovan. \\"Sunshine Superman\\"...\\"Breezes of Patchulie\\"...\\"Celeste\\"...\\"Atlantis\\"...I can't get enough of this guy! His soft voice with a charming accent, his blissed-out lyrics, Donovan just can't do wrong. Every album of his that I've purchased I've loved. But, those albums are all from his hey day in the '60s/'70s... I was a bit skeptical to purchase his new material. What if it was just rehash of old ideas? What if his voice just wasn't what it used to be? What if the album was just BAD all around?!  <br /> <br />I shouldn't have been so worried. This record is wonderful. Words that come to mind to describe it: Delightfully weird. Eclectic. Enchanting... Almost hypnotizing. He has taken a retro idea and modernized it, making the whole \\"Beatnik\\" scene interesting for all of us who weren't there. I can almost see Donovan there on the platform, in his sunglasses and spotlight, singing and reciting his beautiful poetry to the cafe full of hipsters. After each song they snap their fingers in approval. <br /> <br />I shouldn't have been worried about his voice, either. It is just as rich and smooth as it was when he was 25 years old. But  you will hear a maturity in his voice now that wasn't there in the `60s. The flower child has grown up. And I love the music of Grandpa Donovan as much as I love the pot-smoking flower child he is at heart. Donovan is eternally 25 years old to me.  <br /> <br />I won't ramble on anymore. Just buy this record, You won't be sorry! It will take some getting used to at first, but once you give it a chance this music will really grow on you.  <br />It will make you smile and forget about your troubles for awhile. Thank you, Donovan.  <br /> <br />*note: I had a chance to see Donovan in concert a couple months ago and I missed it. I regret it.  <br />
078681859X|5.0|This book is filled with such humor, the characters so well-written .  I will be for ever thankful to the friend that recommended it.  The footnotes, some say are very annoying, i found them to be informative helping me to better understand whats going on.  This book is a must read, so is the sequel.
B00080ZG10|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie for 6 months. I had  a hard time staying awake, through the first half! After all the  awards, and all the hype, I was hoping to really love this film.  Oh well! The only part I really enjoyed, was the plane crash, as  for the rest of the movie, some of it was good. But I found most  of it to be boring.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I recently discovered Sufjan Stevens, and it has been a pleasure becoming familiar with his unique musical language.  The biggest compliment I can offer this album is that it is diverse and complex enough in terms of composition and instrumentation that it keeps my classically trained ear very happy.  Stevens also manages to saturate the lyrics with cultural and poetic triggers that somehow make it all feel so familiar but from some other place or time -- in this way the work becomes a delightful anachronism.
B00005JLWN|4.0|In a world where feelings have been outlawed, the underground recruits the ultimate insider to bring back our humanity. <br /> <br />No one can miss the intense action, or the kickin moves that our beloved new Batman shows off for the audience.  A man with who lost a wife, a son and daughter who take care of their father with immense devotion....  You hear it a lot, but this is a true 'must see'. <br /> <br />
0142004235|5.0|A timeless novel that is a must for anyone who enjoys reading. I could not put it down!
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|To be honest, I was expecting a solid but perhaps a bit boring release from these guys. Don't get me wrong, josh homme projects are all my favourite bands, but I thought that after riding several hard-hitting albums and the removal of nick oliveri they wouldn't be able to match up. Perhaps like some of you, after picking up this cd, I fell into a deep, stoned trance and was suddenly in awe -- this is a surprisingly fantastic, haunting album. The trippy album art seems fitting from the songs, frightening visions lost in dark woods with josh's melodic voice hiding amongst the trees. Like the pixies bossanova album, a dark and mature sound makes this a most impressive hit and comes highly recommended.
B00025ETIW|5.0|When I bought this album, I expected to like only about half of the songs (as usually the case is with me). I was completely wrong...I love every single song on here (except maybe Give 'Em Hell Kid). Gerard's vocals are so raw and emotional, and the guitars and drums are phenomenal. MCR definitely breaks apart from the rest of the pack.
B00005O3VC|5.0|From the opening scene, featuring a then-not-king Arthur and his loyal servent \\"riding\\" through the mist (as it turns out, the servant is banging coconuts together) to the closer (I won't give too much away, but a bunch of people get arrested), this movie is undeniably funny. For instance, take the famed Black Night scene, where Arthur cuts the black night's arms and legs off. The black night insists that these losses of limbs are \\"only flesh wounds\\" and fights on. He's either really brave, or really stupid. Let's not forget Killer Rabit, Tim the Enchanter, the Knights of Nee, and the Bridge of Death. The movie is a real side splitter. I'd recommend it to all. Nee!
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I saw the film when it first came out and, whilst it doesn't bring you right up-to-date any more, it is one of the most wonderfully put together plays - acted with charm and intelligence - that I can remember having seen. Friends are amazed that they've never even heard of it before, let alone seen it.
B000002MP2|5.0|Dookie is my favorite Punk album. All the songs a catchy and very instrumental. This is an album you can get hooked on to. <br /> <br />1.Burnout - 5/5 A great track to start the album. <br />2.Having A Blast - 4/5 This used to be my favorite track on the album, but it is a little annoying. <br />3.Chump - 3/5 This song is one of the 2nd worst on the album. <br />4.Longview - 5/5 A great song, a little inappropriate, but perfect on this album. <br />5.Welcome to Paradise - 5/5 My favorite song on the album. It has a great lyrics and beat.  <br />6.Pulling Teeth - 2/5 A dissapointment after Welcome to Paradise and Longview. It's not Punk enough! <br />7.Basket Case - 5/5 A great song! The best instrumental song on the CD. <br />8.She - 4/5 I like this song but not as much as the other ones on the CD.  <br />9.Sassafras Roots - 4/5 This is a great instrumental song. I like this song a lot. <br />10.When I Come Around - 5/5 This is one of those songs that get stuck in your head all day. It has great lyrics. <br />11.Coming Clean - 4/5 This is a great song because of it's lyrics. It really discribes a 17 year old well. <br />12.Emenius Sleepus - 4/5 is okay but not the best track on the album. <br />13.In the End - 5/5 A good fast paced song! <br />14.FOD/All By Myself - 3/5 If it didn't have the acoustic guitar at the begining I would give it 4 stars.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|When I considered all the marvellous subplots intertwined with the \\"typical\\" action plot of Collateral, I realized that the action was only about half the story. It's really a sort of brainy drama masquerading as an action film. Michael Mann, however, seamlessly brings the two together, and even treats the audience to excellent cinematography! (I saw \\"The Interpreter\\" after buying the Collateral DVD--big mistake. It made me sick to find that the cinematographic potential in the UN building was squandered.) <br /> <br />Buy the DVD, and don't focus on the main plot too much--focus on the subplots and individual characters. And remember to enjoy it! :D
B0002KQNUO|5.0|Alegria means happiness in Spanish, and that't exactly what this CD delivers, a good dose of happiness and a nice escape route from the pre-packaged wasteland of FM radio in the 21st Century. Having bought the CD several years ago, I could hardly wait to compare the listening experience to the live performance that I saw earlier today, and I must admit, the CD was an excellent primer for the show.<br /><br />The most likable characteristic was the way the vocals in the live show matched the vocals on the CD.<br /><br />Listening to Alegria makes you feel as if you've entered a fantasy land full of benign and carefree elves, goblins, and other wondrous mischievous misfit creatures whose only job is to take you to the edge of enjoyment and to let you define what your own limits are. And while the visual effects of the live show are mesmerizing, they would be useless without this powerful sound track, which is worth listening to on its own merits.<br /><br />The songs are all built on melancholy keys, with the arrangements designed to tug at your emotions and create a feeling of Bohemia and old Europe. And despite the expectations of anyone who has ever seen a Cirque show, they deliver just the right dosage of fantasy and escapism with enough versatility to favor a nice drive, a quiet evening at home, or background music for a good book or even working on a project.<br /><br />My favorite song on the CD is Vai Vedrai, which is a trademark Cirque song, with the haunting vocal adding to the sentimental gipsy lament that it seems to be broadcasting.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a good alternative listen, wants to share music with the entire family, or is interested in the Cirque du Soleil phenomenon. Also recommended is a visit to any live performance by this troop, as well as any other of their CD, or DVD/VHS products. They truly deliver the goods.
1582403589|4.0|Following the George A Romero spirit of the dead rising again, this book looks more at the way survivors treat each other in their fight to survive themselves.  Funny how some people risk everything for each other, and others stand back and watch people die thinking they are saving their own skins, but instead killing themselves in the end (safety in numnbers)  Focusing less on the Zombies, and gore, it teaches a good lesson about treating your fellow man.
B0000025JT|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this CD. Thank you for the decent price and availabilty. You were great to work with and I will buy from you again.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|If you're in a hurry, don't even read any of these reviews. Not even mine. The fact that this movie won 4 academy awards including best director, best picture and best supportng actor (Gene Hackman) should make you watch it. Clint Eastwood directed and starred in this western with a great cast and a great moral. Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman, 3 of the best actors ever, now all past 50 years of age, are united in this masterpiece. That should also make you want to see it, because you see these absolutely extraordinary actors all in one extraordinary movie, together.  <br />The film opens with a brutal scene, in which a man badly cuts up a prostitute in her face. He does this because she laughed at \\"the size of his pecker\\". The man and his accomplice are then released without any physical punishment with only a fine as their punishment by Lil Bill (Gene Hackman), the sheriff.  <br />On top of it, the owner of the place doesn't care about the prostitute, and just cares about losing money because of one of the prostitutes' face. But, the other prostitutes can't live after what happened to their friend. So, they combine their money to form $1000.00 and place bounties on the two men's lives. But Lil Bill and his troops are prepared to stand their ground in their town of Big Whiskey.  <br />And then come Ned (Morgan Freeman), William (Clint Eastwood) and Schofeild Kid. Ned and Will are partners that used to be killers. The Kid claims that he's a killer and acts tough. All of them need that money.  <br />But Lil Bill is a corrupt sheriff and a violent man that ridiculizes anyone trying to kill the two men. Gene Hackman is absolutely brilliant and definitely deserved that academy award. He is a violent man that thinks that he can use this violence becuase he is a figure of authority. After beating up English Bob, a man trying to kill the two men for the money, Bill calls him the Duck instead of the Duke in a highly comical scene that is very memorable.  <br />William is a troubled man, traumatized by his killings. He is scared of death and is a poor soul that misses his dead wife.  <br />The movie is so excellent because of the cast, the character development and the execution of the movie. The characters are brilliantly made. Lil Bill is a corrupt man and usually is the vilain. William is the protagonist and hero of the movie but at times, you feel horrified by all of his murders in the past but do pity him also. He's a haunted man trying to change and erase all of the bad he has done. But in the end of the movie, he ends up needing to confront this and needs to decide whether to stop doing what he did or continue doing it.  <br />Schofield Kid is a character that is a mystery. He acts all tough but deep down inside, he ends out being a puny little guy trying to disguise his real self for the whole movie and adventure.  <br />Ned is brought to life by Morgan Freeman and seems the sweetest and most sensitive of the trio. And of course, you've just got to love the amazing Morgan Freeeman.  <br />This movie is a masterpiece with an excellent moral and that needs to be seen. It is in my opinion the best western EVER MADE that is usually sad, funny at times and ends out being a unique and memorable film that should be purchased and rewatched and cherished forever. Movies like this are hard to come around so we should cherish it.
B000000WJ4|4.0|This is the first record of Johnny Winter that I heard. I watched his albums in stores but never listened to them. Then one of my friends gave it to me. I'm more fan of George Thorogood. But it is strange that when I put the cd in I can't take it out. There are few cathcy tunes, like the opener Johnny Guitar, She Likes to Boogie Real Low,...The cover of a christmas song Please Come Home for Christmas, that his duetting with his brother is kinda funny, but it's a good song anyway.
1400031354|4.0|Alexander McCall Smith has written another delightful episode in the tales of Mma Ramotswe of Botswana and The NO. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.<br />In this story the main thrust of Mma Ramotswe's detective work is to try and discover information about the disappearance of an American woman's only son.  He seemingly just mysteriously went \\"missing\\" one day from the agricultural commune where he lived and worked and no one who knew him had any idea where he had gone.  They conjectured that maybe wild anmials had dragged him away or that a whirlwind picked him up, but not one person could say for sure.  Mma Ramotswe works partly by feeling and intuition and she feels she may be able to discover what occurred all those many years ago just by travelling to the spot and gathering the vibes of the spirits that may still be there.  In any event, Mma Ramotswe wants to help the American woman gain some (I really hate this word) closure.  Mma Ramotswe has also lost a child and understands the deep heartache such a loss brings.<br />Interspersed within this story of her detective work is the fact of her romance with kindly gentleman Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and her acceptance of his marriage proposal.  Upon her acceptance of this proposal and diamond engagement ring, she doesn't realize that she sets in motion a plan by his maid to do away with her, the woman the maid views as detrimental to her own plans to dominate Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and his household.<br />Mma Ramotswe also promotes her trusted secretary to the position of Assistant Detective (while still maintaining her duties as secretary) and she begins to shine as an investigator in her own right.  Soon she saves the day for her first client.<br />Add into all of this the fact that Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is coerced into agreeing to adopt two orphans before their wedding without telling Precious and you will find that you will love the characters in this book and anxiously await reading the next one.
B00008J4P5|5.0|With every album The White Stripes are better and better. And when you think that you already know what's goin' on in White's head, they will suprise you even more.<br /><br />Album opens with a hit single Seven Nation Army that it's followed by Black Math (song about teachers).<br /><br />There's No Home For You Here is reworked Dirty Leaves... but it sounds fresh and totally different.<br /><br />I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself is an old Dusty Springfield cover written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. A wonderful ballad.<br /><br />In The Cold Cold Night is the song that Meg sings. It is kindalike old Peggy Lee song with nice organ in the background.<br /><br />I Want To Be The Boy... is another acustic song and it sounds great.<br /><br />Ball And Biscuit is seven minutes long blues,...<br /><br />It's True That We Love One Another is a nice closing theme. A duet of Jack White and Holly Golightly (from brithish garage band Thee Headcoatees) with a little help from Meg White. Nice and funny country song.<br /><br />This album is one of the greatest albums rock 'n' roll ever produced. It's a must for all rock 'n' roll fans.
B00005MP58|5.0|This interpretation is very true to the book. The scriptwriters have managed to transfer the book successfully into TV. The acting is very convincing: I could not believe it at first that Jennifer Ehle, who plays Elizabeth Bennet, is an American. She does an awsome job as the quick-witted heroine of the story. Colin Firth in the role of Darcy is as arrogant as he is in Bridget Jones' Diary. The rest of the cast is very good too, especially Elizabeth's mother, who cannot see what an irresponsible mother she is.  <br />I highly recommend \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" you will enjoy every bit of it.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is A Perfect Circle's 2nd album and this is truly a masterpiece, not only due to Keenan's wonderful heartfelt lyric singing but also that the band's sound evolved into more of a rock album with their sophmore release. The song that grabbed me was the second track 'Weak and Powerless'. The other great song on this album is 'Blue', these two songs make the album and I replayed this songs over and over. You know when you hear a song that you like and you just place it on repeat until you had enough, that's what I've done with this album. It has not left my CD player in several days. All the songs are listenable and not only that but enjoyable and pleasant to listen too. Not to loud or not to soft sounding.<br /><br />For any fan of A Perfect Circle will enjoy this 2nd release - you'd be crazy not to!
B00008CLOA|5.0|Well, as always, your mileage may vary... <br /> <br />It is quite possible for someone to hear this version of the album and hate it. When I first put it on, I wasn;t too happy myself. Then I switched my receiver to direct input mode, bypassing all of the processing that the receiver does and, well, wow.  <br /> <br />The sound of this album on the SACD tracks is a revelation. First, let's deal with the stereo mix. <br /> <br />This is clearly the original stereo mix, with all the little bits of hiss and the tiny sound of some big band playing the beatles barely audible at the tail end of the album. No noise reduction, just really good, clean mastering with all the punch this recording needs. The roto-toms in \\"Time\\" pop out of the speakers, the opening guitars in \\"Breathe\\" shimmer\\", and, well, everything is just right. <br /> <br />Then we get to the surround mix. This is very well done, reflects the orignal stereo mix exactly in volume of instruments, reverb, and tone, surrounds the listener well, and has absolutely no hiss whatsoever. Amazing. Simply amazing. <br /> <br />The cd layer is merely adequate. I agree with other reviewers, something went amiss with the cd layer. But I bought this for the SACD content, and that is simply awesome. To the \\"engineer\\" who said that he wouldn't consider buying a SACD player after hearing the cd layer of this cd, let me offer you an analogy of what you are saying: <br /> <br />I have a 1978 VW bus that I drive occasionally. It shares many common engine parts with some Porshes made at the same time. Your saying that the cd convinces you to ignore the SACD is like me saying that I don't like Porshes because my VW bus doesn't go 100 mph. Sharing parts doesn't make my car a Porshe, and just because the disc is round and shiny doesn't mean that SACD isn't any good.  <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B00006RINF|5.0|I can't believe that it took me so long to find this group!  I remember hearing about them being part of Ozzfest, but I didn't do any research, and totally missed out.  A friend of mine suggested that I give this group a listen, and see what I thought.  After leaving my friend's house that night I couldn't stop thinking about Lacuna Coil!  I had to go out and get this album.  I have been completely addicted ever since.  I just wish that more American listeners could be clued it like i have been.  With everyone listening to Evanescence here in the states, they really don't know what they are missing with this Italian group.  The songs are more rich, both musically and instrumentally.  If I was down to my last dollar I would buy this album over necessities!
B000059Z8J|5.0|This is a great movie that has stood up the test of time quite well. While it may not be up to snuff with some of the computer effects that we see in movies of this century, considering how they pulled off some of the effects and the all star cast that was mixed within, this movie is a real treat and a great representation of the man of steel.<br /><br />We all know the story of Superman. A young baby named Kal-El is sent from a dying planet called Krypton which has a red sun radiating around it's solar system. Before the planet is destroyed the space ship carrying the baby rockets off towards the planet Earth many many light years away. Once under the radiation of the Earth's yellow sun, Kal-El will have many great powers and will become the hero and champion of the planet, named Superman.<br /><br />The acting is probably one of the true highlights of this movie. Chirstopher Reeve as Superman and as the alter ego Clark Kent is probably one of the best to ever put on a superhero costume and portray a comic book character in a movie.  Once you see Reeve playing as bumbling Clark Kent, and then switch to heroic and brave Superman, you will know right away why he was in every way the right choice to play this part.<br /><br />Besides the star we had a few more actors who really added a lot to this movie. Marlon Brando, who got paid an amazing $3 million to play the role of Superman's father on Krypton, Jor-El, amazingly comes off just as smooth as Reeve does. He is only in the movie for a few minutes but without him there may have been no reason to see the movie, as he was the big draw. That is debateable but I must admit he did make the most out of the role. Gene Hackman as the evil mastermind, Lex Luthor, was a very good choice. He seemed to play the role exactly as you would imagine such a person acting and had moments of humor and seriousness mixed in. Most probably won't be used to seeing Hackman in humorous parts but he pulled it off and now we couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. Lastly we have Margot Kidder as Superman's love intrest, Lois Lane. As you will see on this special edition special features, there were many who tried out for the part, Kidder was by far the best and it shows in the movie. She didn't hold back with sass, excitement and humor. All the things you would expect from someone portraying Lois Lane.<br /><br />The movie is really three movies in one. Starting with a sci fi feel of the planet Krypton where we learn of Superman's origins and how he came to be and where he came from and why he was sent here. Then we go to a very Norman Rockwell type of feeling Smallville, Kansas where the rocket ship carrying our hero would land. Only to be found by an old couple named Martha and John Kent. The thrid part of the movie would be in the modern, very colorful looking Metropolis where Clark Kent would find a job as a newspaper reporter for the Daily Planet and first appear as Superman, whenever there was trouble or need of a rescue.<br /><br />Overall it's a great film and considering it was made in 1978, its very impressive how they pulled off some of the special effects. The tagline \\"You will believe a man can fly\\" was double meaning as they really didn't have any great ways to do flight in movies besides blue screens before this. This movie used every effect in the book to get flight to happen in a realistic way and if anything this movie should be noted for that amongst many other things. Every emotion and situation can be found here. We have serious situations, lots of humor, sad moments, happy moments, thrilling moments, love and romance, suspense, nuclear missiles and the goofy sidekick to Lex Luthor. You name it this movie has a bit of it mixed in. Along with great special effects and most of all, its just a lot of fun seeing Reeve flying around as Superman and saving the day like only Superman can. This is a true joy and thrill to watch.<br /><br />As bonus extras on the disk there are the screentests of both Christopher Reeve and all the actresses who were trying out for Lois Lane including Margot Kidder who would land the role.  There is a making of documentary that goes into history of the making of the film, a lot about the director, Richard Donner (who interestingly was supposed to do make the sequal as well but due to problems was let go after the first was in theaters). There is a great commentary done by the Donner as well as others involved with the movie, who clue us in on a lot of tid bids throughout and history.<br /><br />Last but defintely not least there is the music score done by John Williams. Once you hear those first few notes as the credits role at the begining, you will hear SUPERMAN right in the music itself. Its brilient. The soundtrack is a must get as is this movie. I can't really recomend this enough. 30 years later, and this movie is what Superman is. It has everything you could want and more. You will not be sorry adding this to your collections as any age will enjoy this and it will most definitely make you beleive that a man can fly and then some.actresses who were trying out for Lois Lane including Margot Kidder who would land the role.

B000A59PMO|5.0|This show is not only the best new show on television but I would rank it in the top 5 shows on television period. All the check boxes are ticked. Great Cast. Check. Great Writing. Check. Great Direction. Check. Even a great soundtrack. This show has no faults except for being on the wrong network (UPN). Veronica Mars (played brilliantly by Kristen Bell) is a teenage girl who has had to grow up overnight following the death of her best friend, her father (played by Enrico Colantoni) being fired and publicly falling from grace, her mother seemingly abandoning them and her ex-communication from the in-crowd. While trying to solve the mysteries of her best friend's death and her mother's disappearance, Veronica maintains a heavy class load while being a sleuth-in-training in her Dad's private investigation firm. In each episode of the first season we follow Veronica as she unearths clues for the major mysteries in her life as well as the Mysteries of the Week. In several episodes Veronica is seen juggling several cases at once and the audience is left breathless on the edge of their seats. It's a great show and should not be missed.
B000059XUI|4.0|Taking place right where the first movie left us, Superman II returend most of the cast and elements from the first and gave us a thrilling new story.<br /><br />The three Kryptonian villains from the begining of the first movie are released from the Phantom Zone prison and head to Earth to cause havoc and trouble, now that they have the same powers as Superman due to the yellow sun radiation that gives Kryptonians super powers like it did for Kal-El. They waste no time using their new powers and evil plots to try and control the planet. First killing a group of astronauts on the moon then they head to a small town in Idaho destroying it as if it were made of twigs, before finaly taking over the White House in Washington and causing the president to kneel in submission.<br /><br />The trio of terror consists of General Zod (Terrance Stamp) who is the leader and brains behind the reign of terror,  Ursa (Sarah Douglas) the evil and twsited female who kills first and asks questions later and Non (Jack O'Halloran) the silent and slow minded brute who tries to impress his leader while doing his every bidding.<br /><br />Superman (Christopher Reeve) and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) start to advance their relationship in this movie, that was established in the first. Lois figures out that Clark Kent is really Superman so Superman decides to take her into his life and tell her all about his life and history. But he finds out that to love her, he has to be willing to give up his powers and become a mere mortal, as he can't love a human and still be Superman. So he willingly gives up the powers to be with Lois, but this was before he knew of the Trio of Krytponians causing trouble throughout the planet and now there is no one to stop them.  Gene Hackman also returns as Lex Luthor, the evil mastermind, who wants nothing more then Australia and to use these three outsiders for his own twisted power hungry purposes.<br /><br />Not returning unfortunately is the director from the first film Richard Donner, due to creative differences amonst him and the producers so Richard Lester filled in instead and it is noticable the differneces in quality and style that was in the first, compared to this one. Donner directed a lot of the scenes that fill this film but a lot was also changed then was previously supposed to be. As a kid these things are probably not even noticable, but looking back 20 years later, you can see what was over what could have been if politics behind the scenes didn't take place.<br /><br />The movie was full of a lot of great moments. We have the amazing battle that takes place in Metropolis with Superman and the three baddies.  We have Clark Kent now without his powers getting beat up in a dinner, actualy seeing his own blood for the first time in his life. A standoff  at the climax where Superman has to outsmart the three villains and Lex Luthor to restore normacy to the planet Earth.  The Superman and Lois relationship moments may not be for everyone but I did like how Lois tried to get into trouble, to prove that Clark was really Superman by jumping into Niagra Falls only for Clark to have to save her instead as he didn't want to give away his identity.<br /><br />There were some downsides, and it was mostly due to the new directors attempt at humors and lack of agreesion with the evil characters. A lot of moments were changed from what was previously intended so we wind up with the three villains in scenes like the famous using their super breath to blow through the streets of Metropolis to try and stop a mob who was mad they almost killed Superman. That goes on for a few minutes of them just standing there blowing everything on the set away. Including someone on a telephone who still talks after the phone booth is falling apart, someone from KFC who had to hand someone their change only to blow away with the rest of the people and cars galore flying about. Also we have new super powers that Superman or anyone from Kryptonon Earth should never have had including a celephane S logo that Superman throws at one of the bad guys suddenly capturing them with it, teleporting powers with holographic images included within and the ability to make someone lose their memory due to a kiss. It was corny moments like this that definitely caused the movie to lack something over the first. What could have been really great if it were still on it's original flight plan, turned into pretty good overall but with a few bumpy points mixed in.<br /><br />The movie is still great and enjoyable. You gotta take it for what it is, which is a good follow up to a wonderful film, which included most of the same characters from the first minus a director and Marlon Brando who's parts were cut out and replaced with Superman's Krtyponian mother instead.  If you want to see more humor, more great acting by Christopher Reeve (who still played the part as well as anyone could ever have), cool fight scenes, a love story, action and the same wonderful music score written by John Williams.. then you will enjoy this movie and not even mind the few minor downsides to this film. A great follow up  and worthy addition to the Superman franchise.<br /><br />The true disapointment of this disk is that it is not a Special Edition like the first movie DVD is. There are no extra scenes added in, no commentary, no making of. It is just the movie cut of the film and that is it. Which is still great but a lot of fans, including yours truly, would have loved if this got the same treatment as the first. As there were a lot of moments cut out and changed due to the director switch as well as a lot overall that just seemed missing that would have been cool to see. Even a Making of documentary would have been nice.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great edition to anyones movie library. Especialy if you have the first movie, this is must get. They say lighting can't strike twice, this is the perfect example of it doing just that. This was just as much fun and thrilling as the first movie and any fan of Superman or just a fun movie that people of all ages can get into, will be more then happy to watch this movie many times. If anything, just to see what happens to the three baddies at the end is more then worth the watch as they finally get thiers and it's more then worth the wait.nyone from Krypton on Earth should never have had including a celephane S logo that Superman throws at one of the bad guys suddenly capturing them with it, teleporting powers with holographic images included within and the ability to make someone lose their memory due to a kiss.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Have a look at the reviews that give this brilliant album a bad rap. I think you will come to the conclusion, as I did, that since the reviews' respective authors felt they had nothing better to do than post some pretty pathetic material that they are, in fact, likely to be closet Radiohead fans and are overcompensating for something.  <br /> <br />Being called a geek sometimes comes with the territory when you're a Radiohead fan and if your friends call you gay for liking them then I'm sure posting shallow and bigoted reviews will clear up the ambiguity. I wouldn't have weighed in if I hadn't seen that the rating for OK Computer has fallen below five stars and, like Nick, I believe sincerely that they do not deserve this. It may not be for all tastes at first but OK Computer has the potential to reach into the soul of every person who gives the album a chance.  <br /> <br />I believe in the subjective nature of music and therefore hating something does not automatically make it of lesser quality to something we like. I have a broad taste in music and will admit to enjoying the purile and childish music of Blink 182, but only after I opened up my mind a little.  <br /> <br />A newsflash: bands that remain stagnant, essentially shrivel as their peers evolve. Don't get confused, 50 Cent and his fellow OGs only survive because there are so many people who think being \\"creative\\" and explorative with music is irrelevent to a band's success(as is, apparently, their ability to write their own music and play their own instruments)... especially when chart-toppers are \\"hits\\" even before they've been released.  <br /> <br />So if you're going to rain on Radiohead's parade at least examine the quality your own music. If you hear references to \\"sk8erbois\\", \\"bootylicious-ism\\", \\"nines & aks\\" or \\"bricks in da hood\\" (or any other assortment of poorly spelt \\"gangsta\\" quips)in any of your favourite songs, then you might want to refrain from posting a review ridiculing Radiohead. Oh,and Adam... ahem... Scottyboy, as I'm sure you're well known, signing off \\"BEP to the end\\" doesn't help your credibility. But then, that was probably never your intention, was it?
B00008O0WN|3.0|First Contact was the best Next Generation movie, but this is my favorite Next Generation movie.  It's still not great, but I like it a little bit more than the other ones.  I think it's because this movie spends a little more time developing the villian than the other movies do.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you can't develop a villian in two hours that will match a cast of heros that were developed over seven years.  This film gives it a try though, and doesn't do a bad job.  The only problem is, so much screen time is spent developing this villian that not enough time is available to go to the familiar cast we all know and love.  It was a no-win situation.<br /><br />Watch this to see what happens.  You can watch it again if you want, but don't pay a lot of money to do so.
B0002858YS|4.0|I ripped open the package, pulled the liner notes from the case, and opened them with a grin, only to have my grin disappear. Though the music was awesome, there were no lyrics in the liner notes. Pictures are interesting, sure, but that won't help me learn the words to the songs so I can sing along (which, of course, is the best part of listening to music).  <br />I like most of the songs, and I recommend this cd, but only if you can stand the thought of not knowing what they're singing.
B00000ILBK|3.0|Although I consider this to be the worst of the Next Generation movies, I believe I'm giving it the same rating I gave First Contact, which I think is the best Next Generation movie.<br /><br />If this is true, then all of the Next Generation movies are pretty much the same.  Indeed, I feel they are.  They're all on par with what I would call an \\"average\\" episode of the series.  For instance, I would call the episode Symbiosis average.  This movie is like Symbiosis, except longer.  I would give Symbiosis 3.5 stars, but I would give Insurrection 3, just because Insurrection is longer than it needs to be.<br /><br />The film isn't bad.  I can't really identify anything bad about it.  It's plot isn't bad or forgettable, the acting isn't bad, the atmosphere isn't bad.  Nothing is bad.  Everything just seems bland.  I don't know why I didn't like it, but to me it just didn't stand out.  I guess I was spoiled by some of the great episodes of the series that involve things like shifting time periods and dimensions.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|I have been a passionate fan of \\"Dances With Wolves\\" since my first viewing; it is indeed one of the greatest American films ever made.  Mr. Barry's majestic, soaring film score amazes me each and every time I listen to it (as I am doing at this moment.)  I am so happy that an extended version has been released.  The film and music deserve it.  I was fortunate enough to attend college in Bozeman, Montana and chose to drive across country from Pennsylvania for the trip.  I had this soundtrack playing in my old Bronco from South Dakota on and I think one can really appreciate this music when one is driving through the Black Hills and the vast landscapes of Wyoming and Montana.  I even saw a herd of buffalo in South Dakota as the music played when John Dunbar first saw the buffalo herd from atop the ridge in the film.  Pretty amazing!  Anyway, not to wax nostalgic here, but this is an amazingly beautiful and powerful piece of music, one which I cherish and am proud to have in my music collection.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|I saw this movie a long time ago, so I forgot a lot of it.  Still, I remember liking it whenever I left the theater, and I'm a tough audience, so that should say something.<br /><br />The special effects are good obviously.  So if you only watch movies for good special effects, you're set already.  I don't remember the plot at all, but it must not have been too dull since I never wanted to leave the theater at any point until the end.  Still, the plot must be forgettable since I forgot it.<br /><br />There were some memorable characters though.  Magneto is pretty darn memorable, all locked up inside that non-metal cell, killing that guard by pulling a bunch of iron filling out of him.  I remember this weird mental mutant too, that just sat in a wheelchair the whole time and invaded others' thoughts.  It was pretty creepy.  My favorite character though was that evil blue shapeshifting chick.  I had a few impure thoughts about her at certain points throughout the film.  Heck, I even thought she was hot in her original form.  She's got a good figure.<br /><br />I also remember a movie spoiler: one of the X-men died.  I remember which one too, but I won't say.<br /><br />All in all, good enough to watch, but not great enough to remember.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|Biopics are never going to be as good as other kinds of movies.  Too many people will be watching it knowing that facts are fudged to make better cinema.  And that's what has happened here.<br /><br />On the other hand you have Johnny Depp at the top of his form, acting with a really very well done Northern accent that was probably tweaked very slightly in post-production.  I thought that the picture was a little muddled up--was it supposed to show that Barrie was so imaginative that he saved the lives of the Llewellyn Davies boys, or was it the other way around?  And if it was both, then why was it so sad?  Anyone watching the movie would assume that Mary, Mrs. Barrie, the character played by Radha Mitchell, was a social climber in 1904 and that she aspired to get to know Emma Du Maurier (the Julie Christie part) because of Christie's superior social status.  That's just all wrong and the screenwriters must have known this.  There was not this enormous social distance between the two families, both were well-known in theatrical circles but as anyone knows, that was a very louche occupation a hundred years ago, no guarantee of respectability.<br /><br />After the film was over, I realized I had been so captivated by the superior performances of Depp, Christie, Winslet and little Freddie Highmore that I didn't even care.  Was Barrie supposed to have been in love with Sylvia?  I didn't get that in the movie, until quite late, when little Peter lashes out at Barrie saying something like, \\"My mother never cared for you the way she cared for my father!\\"  Johnny Depp didn't even look that upset, just concerned that his boys not suffer too much from her absence.<br /><br />I wish they would make a sequel that would show the horrible things that happened to the four boys in the rough years that were to follow the Edwardian age.  Was it worth it?  Who's to say!  Another bonus is the remarkable acting of Kelly Macdonald (GOSFORD PARK) who plays \\"Peter Pan\\" on stage at the theater.  Don't you love the outtakes part of the disc which shows her slamming repeatedly into walls on her harness?  Ouch!  Luckily her beauty, charm and wit remain intact.he theater.

0806930152|5.0|I was very put off by this book initially for reasons that I see in some of the other reviews: very rough drawings, and somewhat inconsistent labeling.  However, with my professor's repeated encouragement, I stuck with this book, and I'm glad I did.  It outlines a method of machine-like construction that I have found invaluable for illustration, life drawing, and animation. <br /> <br />The idea of breaking down the human figure into simple forms for construction is not new - most good figure books I've come across outline methods of doing this.  (One of the other reviews suggests Andrew Loomis, for example, which everyone should definitely check out.)  What makes this book unique, though, is that it takes the principle a deeper extreme - you learn how to construct not only the basic masses (rib cage, legs, head, etc) but the individual bone and muscle groups that they are made out of.  Solid drawing taken to a new level. <br /> <br />The loose, simplified style of the illustrations is necessary, I think - they capture the bare essense without any distracting detail.  They also demonstrate how dynamic a drawing becomes when it is not overworked.  On the other hand, they can be hard to \\"read\\" if you have no idea what you're looking at, so I think a companion book is necessary as a counterpoint for beginners like myself.  My recommendation would be Dr. Paul Richer's \\"Artistic Anatomy,\\" whose diagrams are the exact opposite of Bridgman's - exhaustive in detail and clarity.  Usually, I have the two books open side by side - Bridgman for construction, Richer for clarification.  Andrew Loomis is another must - very clear, very accessible.  His system of construction is simpler, but as a result it is great for gesture drawing. <br /> <br />Bottom line, this book can be challenging in places, but it is well worth it to puzzle through them.
B00082IJ08|1.0|I was really looking forward to getting this CD. I am an avid listener of Dan the Automator Nakamura, Del the Funkee Homosapien(Russel), Damon Albarn (2-D) from Blur, and Miho Hatori(Noodle) from Cibo Matto. And who doesn't dig the artwork of Jamie Hewlett(Murdoc)? The original concept was a dream come true for me, having all these different artists that I had previously loved come together and create something beautiful. <br /> <br />Imagine my supprise when I first listened to this CD. something was wrong, no flair, no creativity, really bad(read brain dead) rap, it was FLAT....er 2D. It almost seemed that my hero Dan was not in there, and Dell was most definitly not there. But as I comb the cd insert for an explaination, it struck me, <br /> <br />COMMERCIALISM HAS HAD IT'S WAY WITH ME AGAIN!!! <br /> <br />this is not a collaborative effort of worthy artists, it is a solo project for Damon with a large supporting staff. Damon is excellent and I have followed him and Blur for some 15 years now, but he was not Gorillaz. Dan was Gorillaz IMO, and Danger Mouse is not up for the job. this is not his project, he was brought in to fill a void so that more money could be made by riding on the coatails of the previous album. the is a big difference between spawning a brain child and substituting for genius.  <br /> <br />It is just dissapointing when something good is not left alone to die an honorable death. To churn out this album is little more than marketing, in the spirit of so many bad sequel movies. People recognize the franchise so the will give up their money regarless of how bad it is. At least this, no there is no at least, it just stinks. <br />  <br />
B00012QM8G|5.0|Absolutely unforgettable in every sense....Liam Neeson pulls on your heart strings.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the debut album from the southern California nu-metal rockers Linkin Park. This is one of the more original albums out there, because you have the element of old school hip-hop, metal, and modern rock. Here is a song by song review of Hybrid Theory. <br /> Papercut- This is a fast paced rap song. Mike is great here. Chester's vocals in the chorus and the bridge are soaked with anger and rage, which makes for an excellent blend. One of the better songs on the cd here. <br /> One Step Closer- In my opinion, the best song on the cd. This was the first single and it put Linkin Park on the map. There is no rap here, but Chester melds perfectly soft verses to loud chorus seamlessly and effortlessly. His screaming bridge helps you to relate to his anger and it really catapults you into his feelings.The best on the cd. <br /> With You- Good song. Mike's slow hip-hop along with Chester's raging vocals meld perfectly together in this one. DJ Joe Hahn puts on a show for us in the bridge and it sounds great. Very good song. <br /> Points Of Authority- This is one of the examples of Linkin Park going from really soft vocals to loud ones in an instant. Bennington really does a great job here. Mike's energetic bridge goes along great with the theme of the song. A real good one. <br /> Crawling- This is one of the better one's on the cd. The screaming chorus sounds great and the soft verses showcase how varied Linkin Park's sound really is. Mike shows up only in a couple of lines but he makes it count with the voice that will make your skin tingle. This was their biggest hit. <br /> Runaway- This one of the more sorrowful songs on the cd. Chester's verses sound great and so does the chorus. The downside of this song comes in with the bridge. Bennington's screaming does not go along great with Mike's part here. Still, though, Linkin Park mangages to pull it off with results. <br /> By Myself- This song takes the element of the softest hip-hop to go along with some of the hardest rock you hear on the cd. Mike does a great job here with soft lyrics. Chester's chorus is excellent and the bridge is average for them. Good but not great. <br /> In The End- This is the song that shows what Linkin Park is all about. In the first two verses, you have Mike's rhythmic and energetic hip-hop to get you into the feel of the song. In the chorus and bridge, Chester once again shows of his great voice and amazing ability to sing loud and still make it sound really good. This would be Linkin Park's theme song, the one that shows you who they are and what kind of music they make. <br /> A Place For My Head- In my opinion, Mike does his best job here. Very fast and energetic, sounds great. Chester's chorus is great also. Chester's meltdown, screaming bridge goes along great with the theme of the song. Great job. <br /> Forgotten- This song has good verses and a great bridge but the thing that doesn't go well is the first part of the chorus. The screaming along with Mike doesn't go at all and brings this song down to the worst on the cd. If only they had thought of something better, this could have been a really good song. <br /> Cure For The Itch- No lyrics here. An instrumental song that showcases the talents of DJ Joseph Hahn.  <br /> Pushing Me Away- One of the softer and better songs on the cd. Bennington is amazing in this one and Mike's two lines in the chorus are good enough. I love this one.  <br />  There you have it. The twelve songs that put Linkin Park on the map and made them one of the most popular bands of the modern era. When you look at the numbers: 8 million sold in the U.S and 13 million sold worldwide, this is one of the great debuts in modern rock history.
B00004YKUY|2.0|After owning this album since its release I have this to say.  There is something about the vocals that just doesn't impress me as much as it did at first.  That happens to be the audibility of the lyrics.  Instrumentally the album is great.  But there are times when I can't really tell what Steve Augeri is saying.  It seems as if he is trying so hard to hit the high notes that he is unable to form words over the screaming! I think he is a great addition to the band and Steve Perry is great and all that too.  But maybe practice makes perfect?  I don't know.  On the EP Red 13 I could swear I heard him say \\"now spin the potato and mess with each other\\" on State of Grace.  Not what the lyrics sheet says.  But it really does sound like it.   <br /> <br />After noticing that I went back to Arrival and really listened to what he was saying instead of being overly exstatic about the fact that Neal Schon and Jon Cain were at it again I noticed on Higher Place and on a couple of others it was hard to hear exactly what Steve was saying.   <br /> <br />I like Arrival.  ALOT.  Don't get me wrong.  Journey is one of the greatest bands ever and my all time #1 favorite.   <br /> <br />When Generations comes out if I can't understand what they're  saying, It's gonna get shelved along with Arrival, Red13, and that post Nirvana Krist Novoselic album Sweet 75!  Its not a bad album... just not as good as it could be.
B00005JNJT|4.0|This movie definitely makes up for the atrocity that is \\"Batman and Robin.\\"  Although \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\" were excellent movies, this movie is excellent in a completely contrasting way.  Instead of jumping right into the bad guy of the moment, this movie makes the effort to set up the back story of Bruce Wayne, which is well worth it.  The only problems I had with this movie is  <br />1) Cheesey alert!  Liam Neeson's character goes on and on about how one has to conquer fear, until I feel like I'm forced to sit through a presidential speech--\\"The only thing you have to fear is fear itself.\\"  Besides that, Liam Neeson is awesome. <br /> <br />2) I was slightly disappointed that they didn't do more with Cillian Murphy's character, Scarecrow, who has the makings of a worthy bad-guy opponent--interesting and dark, and not at all cheesy. <br />Aside from those 2 little incidents, I deem this movie worthy of its 15 dollar ticket price.
B00005JNTV|1.0|First time in my life I walked out of a movie! Boring, dull, uninteresting! If I had not paid $1 to see it, I would have been angry. I wasn't the only one that left early. Even if free, it's not worth watching.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|Standout tracks are Panic Attack, Root of All Evil, and Sacrified Sons.  <br />A nice return to prog riffs, but unfortunately, just when you are getting into a riff, it changes. This is normal, but in this case most of the best riffs are at the start of songs and then they downshift into something totally different. This album reminds me alot of Falling Into Infinity - more mellower, but not as polished. James Labrie returns to higher vocals, some of which sound like his voice is just about to crack. Reminds me of the (often) flat vocals on the live album Once in a Livetime. My favorite album is Six Degrees. Octavarium is better than TOT - by far, but not up to Six Degrees.
B0006J28L4|5.0|Malcolm, like any young african-american boy in a time of racial hatred, did not have it easy growing up.  In fact he did not have it easy when he was in his teens to early twenties.  Nor did he have it easy when he was an adult.  Yet at least by his adult age he understood this and what his father had been fighting for.  So with his Islamic conversion in prison, he set out to change the world as best as he sought, and, thanks to this film and the autobiography it was based on, we can now truly understand this struggle, inner and outer, for justice, liberty, and the pursuit of all to have happiness.    Now, to narrow in on the film and not just the man, Spike Lee really outdid himself this time.  With Denzel Washington, traditionally a great actor, playing Malcolm X you knew the movie would at least be spearheaded with strength.  But this is more then that, because the elaborateness of it all just conveys to the viewer so much of the times, the thoughts, and the conflicts that surrounded Malcolm and those tumultuous times he lived in.    I'd be lying if I did not say this is excellent, and then highly recommend it; so, I'd like to don this hat of honesty and tell you watch it, a lot of you'd like, but make sure to see it at least once  (Oh yeah, and the book's quite excellent too)
B0009A40ES|4.0|First of all, the book is brilliant.  It is stomach-churning, it is haunting and it gets under your skin for a long time after. <br /> <br />Several have said the book is Misogynist - this is an ignorant simplification.  If anything, the book plays against a misogynist attitude.  It tells the story in first person of a person who sees women as sex objects, and wants what he can get out of them.  This has been focussed on heavily by those who did not understand the book as it was a way of criticising something they didn't get without being accused of being censorial. <br /> <br />Let it be clear: the character is misogynist because he grew out of a misogynist world: the '70s and '80s world of power and money.  This book critiques that world and the human products it produced.  It is not promoting misogyny any more than it is promoting killing dogs and blinding homeless people.  This man is reprehensible, and turns the camera on the reader/viewer to question why you feel enough sympathy to want Patrick Bateman to get away with murder (and torture, rape and animal cruelty). <br /> <br />So, with that cleared up, on to the movie.  I have mixed feelings about the conversion from book to film.  Christian Bale fleshes out the character brilliantly, and is by far the greatest asset of the film.  The screenplay decided to head off in a different direction to the book towards the end and question reality and fantasy.  It is only by accepting this end goal that one can excuse the scene where a chainsaw dropped down several flights of stairs manages to hit a girl with the business end still running and kill her. <br /> <br />Willem Dafoe is a solid actor who struggles with a role that doesn't really suit him, but does the best he can. <br /> <br />The biggest problem with the film is in the end inevitable:  That it lacks the violent punch of the book.  Hollywood is far too weak-willed and fawning to ever allow a movie to be made of American Psycho that addresses the violence and its implications as portrayed in the book.  Perhaps somewhere in Eastern Europe the movie could be made without being Disney-fied, but never in America, and certainly not now in the era of Bush Jr.  Ironically, I don't think even THIS movie could be made in the current political climate. <br /> <br />So is it horrible and gruesome?  No.  Does it raise questions about money, power and abuse? Yes.  Does it degrade women?  No.  Does it show women being degraded in an environment where money and power are abused?  Absolutely.  That's one of the ideas positted in the book which made it to the film.  So should you see the movie?  Yes.  Should you read the book?  If you have the stomach for it, it may well open your eyes.
0792163710|3.0|When I read Schaefer's novel, titled Shane of course, I found some lackluster plot issues.  Yet when this movie was adapted I found that the filmmakers ended up cutting up even more of the plot, and thus took away the true understanding of the book so well. <br /> <br />For example, the name changes are okay, but when one cannot truly sense or believe the near deification that the Starretts make of Shane, then one cannot truly understand the story.  So I understand that the movie had to be changed, but this is one such movie that, to be good, would have had to have an almost complete makeover from the book, as opposed to a partial dressing. <br /> <br />So if you are a fan of the book, then the movie's blatant absences might disturb you, but repeatedly people have seemed to ignore that, so if you are willing to, then I guess you will truly enjoy this only decent film.
B00008EY65|3.0|I haven't read the comic books so I can't judge them, I bought the DVD mainly based on the TV spots looking interesting. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (never read that comic series either) was a mess as a movie, Hellboy was much more entertaining. I didn't quite get the reason for Rasputin (in the comic maybe?) but the storyline mostly made sense in a comic book sort of way. Ron Perlman was good as Hellboy- best part of the movie in fact, Rasputin's tomb was WAY too big. It seemed obvious to me that a sequel was hoped for, I've read that one will be out in 2007.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|I was very excited to learn of Daft Punk's new album in the works. I have been a fan of theirs for a long time. I consider \\"Discovery\\" to be one of my all time favorite albums, and I was really hoping for something killer. <br /> <br />Once I learned the title of the album \\"human after all\\" I got even more excited, I assumed that the music would be even more organic and 'human' whilst still being cutting edge electronic disco-funk fun.  <br /> <br />I remember very well getting this album the day it came out, sticking it in my car stereo, hearing the first few notes of the first track and thinking \\"aw yea!\\"  <br /> <br />Then... about 30 seconds later, I switched the track thinking \\"gee, that was pretty boring... I hope this next one is better\\" <br /> <br />Before long I had gone through the whole album that way. <br /> <br />It is ironic I suppose that the album, titled \\"human after all\\" is far more robotic than anything else they've released.  <br /> <br />For a while I thought it had to have been a joke. Like, they release this album just for fun while they are still working on their next opus. But, as time progresses I don't feel like that is the case.  <br /> <br />Well, there are some great grooves, catchy hooks and neat riffs on this album, but that's about it. The songs are boring, repetitive and they use many of the same synths(which sound like stock synths at that) many times over. <br /> <br />Oh well.
B00092ZMDY|3.0|Ok The concert is good ! Everyone is in good voice and they play all the favorites but those beautiful guitar melodies are missing! No Don Felder! Some other guitarist fills in with a half hearted attempt.....  Ooooo Tequila Sunrise doesn't dance the way it should... You know that beautiful Spanish Guitar solo? Missing !  So if that wonderful melody line is a favorite of yours buy Hell Freezes Over.....  There they are complete !!
0393324818|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone who loves baseball. Actually, you don't even have to be a fan of baseball to enjoy it. If you appreciate logic and reasoning, this book is for you too. The baseball background makes it more entertaining. I honestly could not lay this down till the very end.  <br />Lewis writes about a bizzare baseball franchise, the Oakland Athletics and about it's unorthodox front-office headed by GM Billy Beane. Beane and his Harvard assistants clash with the oldschool ex-ballplayer scouts over the potential draft picks. The former wants to make rational and objective picks based on stats while the latter on what they themselves have seen. Thats where it sort of starts off atleast. The story that follows will have you questioning the importance of pretty much every basbeall stat that you have been led to believe are important (batting average, RBI, stolen bases etc.) It is hard to believe that most of baseball continues to ignore the inefficiency in their methods even in the face of the hard evidence that has been circulating around as early as the 80's. <br />The eye-opening content coupled with the engaging prose of Michael Lewis provides a truly entertaining and educating read.  <br /> <br />With that said, let's go RedSox.
B00068NVI4|5.0|I watched this concert on PBS.... an abbreviated version and now have it on dvd and it is fantastic.I saw them twice on this tour. I'm somewhat bious being big fan of YES, but this concert is outstanding. These guys are incredible musicians and we are lucky they are still playing. They play at intense levels at every perfomance and this is no exception. I don't doubt they will fine tune it for the dvd....but I won't complain....just enjoy it that much more!!!!! Enjoy it while you can... you will not be dissapointed..... and it could be thier last dvd with Wakeman. An increbible band!!!!!
B00000251N|5.0|thank you. <br />the itam came on time and it was in good condition.
B000067J1Q|4.0|From time to time the movie is a little bit trashy. But still I like it. It's not my favorite movie with Julie Andrews. But the songs are classic, the scenery aswell and the final like a thriller. Just great classical movie! A+++
B00003CXSP|5.0|This is a brilliantly executed film, made from a novel that was pretty good but ran away a bit at the end. <br /> <br />Julianne Moore steps up to a tough role transfer with aplomb. She is steady as the compass needle, as was Jodie Foster in the original Starling role. Foster's dramatis persona was bit more shakably vulnerable & close to the surface than Moore's. Julianne uses a more subverted emotional sensitivity... her Starling is less prarie-sweet and more stolidly defiant. It works well and the action is written around this. <br /> <br />Gary Oldman is creepily endearing as a surviving Hannibal victim who wants to save face in an elaborate act of revenge. His Mason Verger has some crackerjack performances delivered with Oldman's unusual skill for making simple dialogue lines quite memorable. <br /> <br />And of course Hopkins' utterly magnetic Dr. Hannibal personality is again vastly enjoyable, almost to the pitch of wishing we could know someone so interesting and cultured in real life. But... perhaps better to keep all one's parts instead. <br /> <br />And if Florence does not win your heart, does it yet beat in thy breast? There is much visual beauty throughout this top-shelf Ridley Scott's work. Watch the DVD extras to learn a great deal about he refined the film, by leaving some things out.
B00005JLIU|4.0|It's a very amusing movie, with lovely costumes and sets. Julie Andrews as \\"countrygirl\\" in the big city! Fantastic to see.
B00005JLRT|3.0|I can't say the story was good but this movie had a very good opening! the main weakness of the movie was It's visuals. Visuals and CGs were as good as a TV production, not better! and second weakness was Shinzon! at least they could create more intresting character. well, it's a rule! all successful series must ruin in a sequel and Star Treck Nemesis, ruind the next generation series success! But, honestly, it's not that bad as some say! <br />If you have all of the Star Treck movies, it'll be good if you buy this dvd for you collection too. It's full of special features and worth. but buying this dvd individually for personal uses or as a gift, seems not to be a good idea!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Great music and great execution. My only wish is that Don Felder was there.
B00025ETIW|5.0|THE OPENING SONG HELENA IS THE BEST..AND FROM THERE IT ONLY GETS BETTER. THIS CD IS AMAZING AND IT BLEW ME AWAY. ITS ALL I LISTEN TO NOW...ITS AMAZING. GET IT.
0765309408|3.0|It was an interesting concept... <br /> <br />On Earth, if you live to be 75, you can join the Colonial Defense Force, which means you give up all your earthly possessions (humor), get declared legally dead, you ship off to space and you can never go home again... <br /> <br />You volunteer to serve for two years, or ten years if they need you.  They need you.  You assume they do something to make your body younger, because who needs a 75-year-old soldier? <br /> <br />It's a 300-something page book and the first 100 pages aren't so interesting because it is basically a bunch of old farts wondering what is going to happen.   That should have been reduced to 20 or 30 pages.   <br /> <br />After that, it gets better.   There is the mandatory discussion about \\"odds\\" on living past two years, ten years, etc.  There is training, this, and that, and so on, and some battles. <br /> <br />Not a classic, but a good read once you get past the beginning.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|The movie wins!  Patton was not a superstar away from the battle grounds, though very perceptive and bright.  The movie is a, \\"No letdown\\" film that shows an array of features, such as great `shots, sound, action, acting, etc.  This movie belongs in all libraries!
B000002B49|4.0|Boy, this is a tough one to review.  For just about anyone, I mean, because this is so unusual, so far removed from anything else, even other New Age music (oh, just deal already!), there's absolutely nothing to compare it to.<br /><br />Which means you have to judge it for what it is, which is...well, I don't know.  It has the pygmy sounds, and I could tell they were going for the \\"electronica\\" elements (nice touch), y'know, so it doesn't get lumped with generic New Age.  Other than that, this is just a very nice, offbeat, listenable album.  I did say \\"really pretty\\" too, right?  :-)
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Once you succeed in a certain area/genre, the next logical step is taking things to the next level. How many times have we seen a band do the same thing over and over (because they make a CD in which the formula they use sells CD's and sets them aside from the rest of the crowd) but ends up burning out from overuse of their own formula? The type of band i've mentioned is common in our day and age and the ones that survive are the ones that are able to evolve and create their own unique formula which encourages evolution. A7X is one of those bands. Shame on the person that says they've sold out while proclaiming they've been a true fan since the beginning (their beginning is \\"unholy confessions\\")--while i'm not trying to take away their merit and their best intentions, nor am I denying the fact that you're a true fan, you honestly don't have the right, nor the competance, to say that they've sold out, that they've let their true fans down. I'm one of those fans that will buy loads of this CD to give out to people on the streets since I know that the intelligence and competance shown by A7X will be enough to reel them in and bring forth a new breed of fans--the thinking kind; the kind that appreciates and knows music, etc. You will be of no loss to the group if you keep a negative attitude to a band you all swear to love. Having the band members talk about this album and mention that this album has them feeling the happiest with the end result compared to the other albums shows that this CD is intended to set them aside from a certain genre/style and have succeeded in creating an album which will go down in history has being \\"one of the best in 'genre'\\", without a doubt! Now, thank you for sticking with me this long so i'll write a review for each song. Being a music educator and being formally trained in music theory, this album was, literally, music to the ears. <br /> <br /> <br />1)The Beast and the Harlot--I read in an interview when WTF came out that the band members weren't necessarily religious but that they knew the bible and they each, naturally, had their own interpretations of what the books meant. As is the case with the CD titles and some song titles, they stick to those religious allusions with extreme accuracy. As it turns out, most are dealing with the book of revelations (the first LP being title \\"sounding the seventh trumpet\\" as pertaining to Revelations, some lyrics and song titles on WTF \\"with this ink on our flesh we've sealed our fate\\" on Reminissions which talks about the mark of the best and conflict between believing and not believing in a god up to this song, The Beast and the Harlot, also pertaining to the book of revelations. The lyrics are, IMO, a metaphor for events taking place in our world today and the way they've written it, we're able to relate to it. The chords at the beginning were a surprise since most of their songs were in minor keys using alot of Flats but this one was written in major keys with alot of sharps. Synyster and Zacky are on once again, The Rev is exposed in this song especially during the chorus, Johnny has some nice licks and Shadows vocals sound really good. Nice solid song to start the CD off. 9/10 <br /> <br /> <br />2.Burn It Down--The CD starts off intense with some solid drums and riffs and then explodes into a guitar harmonization which is catchy as well as familiar. I won't get into the song lyrics much as they're all up for interpretation but will rather focus on the song as a whole taking into consideration what I take the lyrics to mean. This song follows the formula used on WTF and they use it to their advantage. The 2nd half of the song totally caught me off guard and was quite impressed with the musicianship and knowledge of the band members. IMO, it's classic A7X and is one of the best songs on the first half of the CD. 9/10 <br /> <br /> <br />3. Blinded In Chains--WOW, DRUMS! This song has really nice drum sections especially the little herta bassdrum breakat around 2:52. Power guitars on this track but aside from the drums, the vocals sound a tad bit the same as #2 and #4 so i'm not that big a fan of this track but for what it's worth, the drums and strings definately earn this track a 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br />4. Bat Country--The first single to be released from the CD. This is the \\"unholy confessions\\" (Except better) and is influenced from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The song starts off with the quote \\"he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pains of being a man\\" and they follow along with that theme throughout the song. There's a harmony guitar break (2:52) after the guitar solo and once again, it's one of the standouts on this CD. Synyster and Zacky get a chance to shine on this CD with the solos being tasteful and just right. It's a decent choice for first single since it shows the evolved A7X moreso than other tracks while still maintaining the ability to bring in fans via this new sound (as previously mentioned)...8.5/10 <br /> <br /> <br />5.Trashed and Scattered--The first song that is heavily influenced by spanish-style chords and it does a good job of setting up the 2nd half of the CD. There's some velvet revolver influence in the bassline in the section before the chorus. Most of the verses are extremely familiar and anyone with an educated music ear will find these progressions to be complicated. The guitars shine like always and the drums are tasteful. The V.R bass influence adds a nice touch to the song. My favorite song on the first half of the CD. <br /> <br /> <br />6. Seize The Day--The 2nd half of the CD is started by Seize The Day and it does an AMAZING job of setting up the tone for the rest of the CD. This song uses Piano, Acoustic Guitar and then the rest of the ensemble joining in. This song is structured into 3 different progressions: 0:00-0:13 (the first one which is also the chorus), the 2nd is 0:14-0:38 which are the progressions for the verses and the last is from 0:39-1:05which is the pre-chorus progressions. They're very distinct with subtle similarities that will definately be appreciated. The musicianship is shown once again in all the performers. This song is the Warmness of the Soul from STST, the I Won't See You Tonight from WTF and will go down as one of the greatest A7X songs ever. 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br />7. Sidewinder--WOW!!! This song is the beginning of the Epic tracks on this album. The first track to take after the spanish influenced that was previously mentioned in Trashed & Scattered but this time, they use full on Spanish guitars and ends with a gorgeous spanish guitar solo. This song seems to have some, shall I say it, Rufio inluence at around 3:00 when he sings \\"making my way through the night, you're still in my sights\\"--to me, that's signature Rufio style in the way they play the guitars, the way the rhythm is shown in the drum beat. This song is one of the best songs on the CD...emotion is there but isn't as powerful as The Wicked End or MIA. This song is 10/10 and earns every single bit of it. <br /> <br /> <br />8. The Wicked End--my 2nd Favorite song on the entire CD. The song is once again influenced by the book of revelations. While reminissions felt like a battle between believing and not believing, this song is definately on the believing side and it's humbling. While the song is positive for the faithful, there's a very serious underlying message of armaggedon and our final days on earth. The 2nd half of this track is started off by a Danny Elfman-inluenced (you'll be reminded of nightmare before christmas, edward scissorhands, beetlejuice) orchestration which features a full set of strings and choir but the best part of the song is when Shadows starts singing right after the orchestra part. That minute or 2 of him singing is the most emotional and intense part of ANY song i have EVER heard. You can tell feel the emotion in his voice, you can feel what he's thinking. It ends with him singing up a few augmentations and is just wailing into the mic. You will get goosebumps for days everytime you hear this song. That section goes like this: <br /> <br />\\"As the prophets shed their light on what's to come, the crowds did gather.  Your time is precious they explained, no time to worry, messiahs coming. Don't go to sleep tonight, darling, hold me in your arms. These will be our final days and I can't let go.\\" <br /> <br />It doesn't get any better than this, my friends. 20/10 <br /> <br /> <br />9. Strength of The World--What I like most about this song is the acoustic guitar and Violin accompaniement in the intro. It's completely gorgeous and was all written by A7X. The progressions in the chorus are once again familiar and will be pleasing to your ears. The instrumentation of this song is at the same level as MIA, Sidewinder and The Wicked End but the vocals aren't. I personally feel there isn't much substance to this song, in comparison to the other songs, but is still a good song. The strings and the drums seem to lose steam after the intro and there is a rather random section beginning at 5:27 and honestly, that kinda kills the track for me. For this one...7/10 <br /> <br /> <br />10. Betrayed--Outta respect to Dimebag, this song should be given a 10/10 but I can't connect with this song at all. I feel disattached and I can't relate to the song at all. The vocals are decent, at best, but it seems like they did the song just to do it...that respect is understandable and naturally, they're not going to write something that's going to \\"suck\\" but my personal opinion with respects to this song is that of indifference...6/10 for song, 10/10 out of respect. <br /> <br /> <br />11. MIA--My favorite song on the CD. Words can't describe what this song means to me. It's a song of personal conflict and deals with what you need to do for yourself, for God and for country. Has extremely powerful message of war in which we all can relate to in some way or another and the emotionin his voice brings you in by the neck and keeps you close by. This song doesn't let up its intensity and there's a resolution on this song that, along with the after-orchestra part on The Wicked End, is worth the price of the CD alone. This song will go down as one of the best songs of all time if we give it a chance to get there. 20/10 <br /> <br /> <br />I want to thank you for sticking through this review and reading it all the way through. It took me a while to write out and I put alot of thought into it. I respectfully disagree with those that call this CD another AFI Sing The Sorrow influenced piece of work. In reality, this CD follows the tracks of such metalcore greats from the UK such as DragonForce, Sonata Arctica and bands like Stratovarius. The 80's metal influence is there also and the guys in those bands are proud of the evolution; the uniqueness of bands like A7X and CD's like this one. Do yourself a favor and listen to City of Evil, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and Waking the Fallen (in that order) and then have an opinion based on what you hear and have the will power to dismiss any negative opinion that you've read here. I'm in no way affiliated with the group nor do I look like all these hardcore \\"fans\\" that dress a certain way to like a certain type of music. But when Shadows says he'd LOVE to open for a group like HIM (Finland) and are heavily influenced by UK Metalcore groups, that says alot about our current state of musical talent, music and management here in the USA. You won't see many bands like A7X here in the USA so please take into consideration the effort i've taken in writing this and take my comments to heart. Thank you once again for reading! <br />-Tommy
B0007OY2MG|5.0|This is the second purchase I have made of the Gilmore Girls.  Last year I purchased Gilmore Girls 2nd Season and now recently I purchased Gilmore Girls 3rd Season.  Both purchases were for gifts for my niece.  She thinks I am the best Uncle ever for these DVD purchases.  She gets together with her Mom and sister and they watch the Gilmore Girls for a whole weekend.  My niece is 24 and it is a wonderful opportunity to get together with her Mom and sister.  She loves the DVD collection...and she loves me for purchasing this for her.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I bought \\"Hail to the Thief\\" almost two years ago and hated it.  I found the vocals to be annoying and moany, and the tempo much too slow for my taste.  Two years later, I bought \\"OK Computer\\" to give the much acclaimed Radiohead another chance.   <br /> <br />Wow.  That's all I can say.  This is probably one of my favorite albums that I've bought this year (right up there with Bright Eye's \\"Wide Awake\\"), and I just bought it only a week ago. <br /> <br />I'm no die hard fan of Radiohead by any stretch of the imagination, but they are definitely worth this music-lover's time.
B00006RJHG|1.0|This movie was just awful. The plot was bad, the acting was even worse and it was really slow. The movie was just plain bad. So why did i give it one star? because i was interested the first ten minutes. I watched 45 minutes of it and then turned it off. My money and time was wasted on this movie. Don't watch it.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I've always been a big fan of this kind of music.  I love the combination of new age and Celtic.  Of course I am a big fan of: <br /> <br />ENYA <br /> <br />LOREENA MCKENNITT <br /> <br />CLANNAD <br /> <br />CELTIC WOMAN is different from these groups in that it is focused on ensemble music rather than one vocal lead (well some of Clannad is ensemble but not as much as the early days). <br /> <br />I suggest enjoying the whole range of Celtic music from this (which is more like Celtic Opera) to more rustic groups like The Chieftans and their like (you know, the Green Linnet crowd). <br /> <br />If you are doubting on whether to buy this listen to track #2 and track #5.  Those transcend the rest and are well worth the price of the CD alone! <br /> <br />Oh and get the DVD!!  It's a wonderful concert and you will enjoy it many times over!!!! <br /> <br />Thank you.
B0006L16N8|2.0|First off I am a coldplay fan. I love their first 2 cds and feel they were much better than this cd. I bought the new oasis cd and think its the best cd out there and best of 2005. i got  x&y and to tell you the truth had to turn it off. i feel like they tried too hard on this cd, but also went to commercial with it. most of the songs are very boring and sound the same. i dont care if the lyrics are great causeother than that the music is terrible. it sounds as if there are no drums and guitars in this cd. speed of sound was the first single which i thought was too overproduced, but not bad. after that there is nothing i like on it. i tried giving it a chance, but after 7 listens and falling alseep 3 times i had to sell it. coldplay missed with this cd like people think oasis missed with be here now, which i love. i hope thier next cd is more like their other stuff and we get more songs like high speed and green eyes. chris martin is trying to sound too much like thom yorke of radiohead and the thing is noone can do that. radiohead is radiohead and martin should stay away from copying them cause they kick a*s. so if you want to start listening to coldplay buy thier first 2 cds and not this one. if you are like me you'll buy it cause you want all of a band's cds but i warn you, test it out before you get it and if you really want a sick cd, get oasis, Don't Believe The Truth. sorry coldplay but i am upset with this effort.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Omar and Cedric are the most unbeliveable musicians that have ever lived. Some people say the lyrics make no sense. They do make total sense. That is what is so great about it. You have to think about it more then just hear the same old crap. Also it is more intelligent then just writing random tracks and putting them on an album. The entire album tells a story of a mans life.Buy this album and their newer one Frances the Mute or you will wiss out on the greatest album of all time.
B00006879E|1.0|I have to admit, I kinda liked Maroon 5 the first time I heard them. The songs weren't great or anything, but pleasant enough to listen to every now and then. The emphasis here is on \\"every now and then\\". Instead I'm hearing Maroon 5's songs nearly ever single day. For some reason Maroon 5 have become pop's new golden group <br /> <br />Are their songs unlistenable? No, not at all. The main problem is that they're average. Painfully so. There's nothing truly exciting about their music, or truly creative. And after hearing the same song everyday for almost a year, it's obvious to say that I've grown sick of them, especially when you have all these critics and fans constantly going on about the group as if they're the greatest group that ever existed. <br /> <br />Their instrument work is nothing spectacular, and Adam Levine's voice get's extremely irritating after awhile, especially in the tracks where he starts moaning during the song (such as Tangled). As for the songs themselves, they're all pretty much about the same thing, all of them in some way love songs, and there's much better songs out their for that kinda thing. Also, \\"She Will Be Loved\\" literally causes me pain every time I'm forced to hear it, which is unfortunately far too frequently. <br /> <br />Who knows, maybe they'll actually come up with something decent on their next album. But as far as I'm concerned, right now Maroon 5 is an average at best group that has been massively overrated and overexposed
B0006L16N8|1.0|A wayyyy-overrated, merely competent corporate band. Instead of having some bollocks and artistic integrity to find their own sound, they are trying hard to be something between U2 and Radiohead--and failing embarassingly at both.  Pretty edgeless, predictable, and limp stuff. They make The Fixx sound like Pantera. <br /> <br />If U2 was the Beatles, then Coldplay is The Monkees.
B00005ATZT|5.0|This special edition is even better than the original version. The classical thriller of all times. Harrison Ford is superb.
B0000009W6|5.0|my first bowie cd, i just got it, ziggy stardust and diamond dogs. i just finished listening to this and now i am going to listen to the others. boy, this was great!! LIfe on Mars? Is without a doubt the best, the other songs are masterpeices. this was a very good introduction to bowie, none of theese songs are bad
B00097A5HW|5.0|The world famous Shakira did the right thing when she decided to release an album solely consisting of songs delivered in Spanish. This a treat the she has given to us latins (i'm from Portugal)not only because of the language, but also because of her voice that somewhat sounds better on her native tongue,but due also to the overall quality of this record.I'll do a track-by-track to justify its greatness. <br /> <br />1-En Tus Pupilas- A great track that starts with a french opening that fools you to believe that this song won't be any good.Wrong.This has one of the best  choruses of the whole album,and it is one of its catchiest tunes.In it Shaki delivers a well-constructed but low-key song.A must-hear.10/10 <br /> <br />2-La Pared- To start it off,I must say I fell in love with this track from the moment I first heard it on Shakira's website.It has a fenomenal crescendo, and the chorus and the overall song are some of the best pieces of music Miss De La Rua has done. Emotional and pleasing,this track could be a huge hit around the world if she decides to release it.Totally amazing and first contester for best of this album 10/10 <br /> <br />3-La Tortura- An altogether good track with Mr.Sanz vocals that really upgraded it and made it a hit amongst all spanish speaking countries in the world.I still like it,but it has lost some of this former appeal,just like \\"Whenever,Wherever\\" from the previous record.In spite of that, I find it really good,because this was the song that made me buy \\"Fijacion Oral\\" in the first place.By anyone's standards, this is not one of the best on this album.8/10 <br /> <br />4-Obtener un S- This is the track in this, that I like the least and one that I end up skipping because I don't really fond of Bossanova rhythms and songs.Nonetheless, it is a song that her fans will approve , because it's not very bad.I just don't like it and I believe this is out of place in here. 7/10 <br /> <br />5-Dia Especial-A lovely track, in which Shaki asksfor her lover to forgive her and come back to her.It is one of the best constructed tracks in here ,kinda similar to \\"En Tus Pupilas\\".What brings this song to an higher level is the guitar(or synth,I don't know)solo right after the second chorus.A fantastic song,but one  that takes longer time to fully appreciate than some of the others 9/10 <br /> <br />6-Escondite Ingles- This track has many people talking about it,obviously because of its hard rock nature,  doesn't quite fit within the rest of the album.I absolutely adore it,because of its rhythm and beat,quite good for dancing and shouting.What lets this track down are its lyrics that are mainly about how shakira likes to play hide and seek,which is an understament to a certain thing some of us like do at night and with the lights off...Kinda filthy...and that's what I love about it 10/10 <br /> <br />7-No- A don't come back-I'm really hurt by you type of song.One of the most introspective songs in the outing and one with the best lyrics.This the slowest track on the whole album but Gustavo Cerati's vocals and Shaki's innate pain comes through making this another one of the best.I understand why Shakira chose it for second single,but there are better choices.I guess every artist has to release a ballad sometimes...9/10 <br /> <br />8-Las De La Intuicion- Here comes the most commercial track and obviously made to be a single.But this is not at all a bad thing.This tune is one of the most instantanealy likable in the recording .With its disco-latin beats and whispered vocals ,it could go straight to all summer parties out there.Not very good musically nor lyrically but who cares?? 10/10 <br /> <br />9-Dia de Enero- Tied with \\"La Pared\\", this is the best on the album because of everything.Its amazing hooks and melodies.Shakira's candid yet sexy deliver of the song,especially on the part she says she will cure your wounds and do much more to you.(I wish she would sing it to me in private).When I listen to it ,it always reminds me of youthfullness and being young.I absolutely can't live without this song and if I had the chance of picking just one song off this album, this would be it. 100/10 <br /> <br />10-Lo Imprescindible- A very underrated track among critics and fans alike.I do not at all believe it is that bad but I do agree this is probably the weirdest sounding song Miss De La Rua has done.The bennining of it is a tad scaring, but the chorus is again one of the best on the album and reminds me of my favourite track off the \\"Ladrones\\" album,which was \\"Inevitable\\". A very good track,just not single material.10/10 <br /> <br />I must say I won't review the bonus tracks,because I don't agree with them being on the album,due to the fact that they are not needed.I presume they were imposed by Shaki's record label to fill up the record... <br /> <br />So here it is,my quite lenghty review of Fijacion Oral,which is undoubtdly the best Pop record released in 2005.Won't be considered like it deserves to be,because it is sung in Spanish.Like I quoted earlier,Shakira sets the bar really high with this record and if the next one in English is just as good as this,I will be more than satisfied and forced to say that she could be the new Madonna.More than anyone else,she has the talent for it. <br /> <br />

0783231032|1.0|First let me say that I love comedy. If this film had any comedy in it, I'd love it too.  Unfortunately, this is just a frenetic and pointless attempt at humor that explodes into two plus hours of tedium.  There is abundant talent here, but it is rarely used.  The sparsity of plot, which usually works in comedy's favor, here, just highlights how sad the jokes are. There is scarcely a laugh in the entire movie. <br />How anyone can take a fantastic cast like this, and create a bomb like this is beyond me.  To borrow a line form Pauline Kael, \\"If this movie were any more of a dog, it would shed!\\"
B00079018K|1.0|I can't even comment on the music on this CD--I'm sure that if it had been on a normally functioning CD, I would have loved it. But my experience has been brusquely hijacked by Sony's stunningly crude \\"copy protection\\" scheme, which insists that you \\"enjoy\\" the CD in an inescapably fullscreen (or absolutely invisible) application with--apart from a cheezy Windows Media plugin--two controls: \\"minimize\\" and \\"close\\".<br /><br />I don't copy CDs. I don't rip them. I don't have an MP3 player. All I like to do is listen to the music I paid for, as a conscientious customer, at work, while I work. WinAmp's \\"windowshade\\" mode is perfect for this, allowing me to change tracks, adjust volume, etc., with minimal interruption of my flow, and its intelligent design is in stark contrast to the Neanderthal user interface Sony-BMG has seen fit to inconvenience us with. I refuse to believe that the mercenaries who designed and marketed this atrocity actually use it to listen to their own personal music collection. Foisting it on us is therefore a glaring crime of business ethics, and I feel like a chump for not having read the ultra-fine print on the back. But it won't happen again, I learned my lesson. But you don't have to learn the hard way: do NOT purchase this experiment in consumer debasement.<br /><br />When an industry begins to see its paying customers as adversaries, we are surely witnessing its demise.
B00005MP58|5.0|There is not much more that I can add that over 600 people have not said except if you ever have the chance to see Pride and Prejudice with Lawrence Olivier and Greer Garson, SKIP IT!.  Granted Sir Lawrence is pretty to look at and believe me I adore older movies, but the ending is typical of what Hollywood did back then which is such a crime.  Just trust me in knowing that Lady Catherine de Bourgh's reaction is not exactly the same in that film version. <br /> <br /> A&E did as it always does when it brings classical literary works to the small screen, which is being true to the author's works and not try to appeal to the masses by giving it an ending that studio heads like better.   <br />The cinematography is pretty and the acting is wonderfully in sync with Jane Austen's writing.  It's hard picturing Darcy and Elizabeth any other way than the way Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle brought them to life.  Mr. Bennet portrayed by Benjamin Whitrow is a riot when reacting to his youngest daughters and his wife's antics.    It's just a joy to behold from beginning to end.  You won't be sorry if you purchase this DVD.  <br /> <br />  <br />
B0009R1T7M|5.0|With each subsequent album, Sufjan Stevens has slowing been building note-by-note, song-by-song into the musical equivalent of a modern day Walt Whitman. His talent is so immense it can only be obscured by the sheer volume of material he churns out. It's as if midterms happened every week instead of once a semester.<br /><br />In the short 18 months of my initial discovery I've taken in the albums, Greetings From Michigan, Seven Swans, and now current release Illinoise as some of the most accomplished songwriting and execution thereof to levels unfamiliar to modern man. The entity of Sufjan is so simple and doubly complex that a big label record company wouldn't have a clue where to start. \\"Hey Sufjan, can you scale this back a whole bunch for our radio listeners\\"? \\"Yeah, sure thing fella, I'll get right to that\\".  To that end and his credit, some of the titles contain more subjective content than most entire song lyrics by others.<br /><br />The last thing the business end of the record industry wanted or needed was for some guy who came from out-of-nowhere, who can do it all, and is not in the least interested in what they have to offer. Imagine the image and career of 50 Cent or Mariah Carey without the machine working behind them, stuck in overdrive and overtime. I get a picture of some record rep plodding through some dense backwoods, covered in sweat, his lizard skin boots caked in mud, silk jacket torn, continually referring to an illegible map drawn on a discarded napkin, searching for some hidden paradise of folksy, organic electronica, armed with a briefcase full of contracts defining and limited to just sign here. Then there's Sufjan with pen and ink, writing in fervor, plucking out a few bars on piano or banjo, surrounded by the comfort of dozens of instruments and recording mixers, humming as the chorus sings along.<br /><br />With his gift for storytelling and ability to compose a song from even a tidbit, Illinoise sounds as if he drove through the state real fast on nothing but back roads, gathering odds and ends of the unusual. With the ghost company of Carl Sanberg and Shelby Foote whispering in each ear to help hone his craft, he portrays a perfect pop-folk picture of Americana. It's mighty task to undertake. One he relishes and delivers with panache and circumstance. Look out for our nation's new songsmith. He's coming to a state near you soon. He's sure to write an album about it. A darn fine one too.hing but back roads, gathering odds and ends of the unusual.

B0001L3MI0|4.0|This is without a doubt one of the cheesiest Sci-Fi movies I have ever seen+that is precisely what makes it so enjoyable.  There are holes in the plot big enough to drive a starship thru,yet the film somehow allows you to ignore them+still have fun.  Aliens travel millions of light years to destroy Earth+Jeff Goldblum brings them down w/a virus from his laptop--dont these people have Norton?  The performances are excellent given the material--one of the reasons this film works is that the actors do not take themselves or the film that seriously.  Bill Pullmans grand Independence Day speech is so hammy it should come w/a slice of pineapple.  My advice is very simple:Turn your brain off+enjoy the ride.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I wasn't a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's first few films (Memento, Insomnia, Following) but this one is on a whole other level in my mind.  Takes the comic book format as far as it can go and leaves us wanting more.  Christian Bale is the definitive Bruce Wayne/Batman and Michael Caine delivers a truly great performance as Alfred.  The entire cast is unbelievably good especially (Gary Oldman, Mark Boone Junior, Rutger Hauer and of course Morgan Freeman)and the script is very well written.  Too early to say if its better than the first two Superman films but it certainly gives them a run for their money.  The score is also quite good and the editing (pacing) is to die for throughout the film.  Why can't more films in this genre be this good?  Can't wait till the sequel comes out!
B0009AM5JA|1.0|Couldn't play this cd in my stand alone dvd player or my computer without skipping, clicks or pops ... EMI should wake up and realise this tatic actually reduces sales!
B00011RPB0|5.0|This movie is subtle, whitty, and charming. A superb work of art for Sophia Coppola. Scarlett and Bill and delightfully funny.
B000002H97|1.0|I can't beleive people actually listen to this kind of music..where is the hip-hop??
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Honestly, I love this musical.  I saw it last night in Hollywood for the first time, and my revelry still hasn't worn off.  Like everyone else has stated, this musical soundtrack is amazing with it's original cast... but (yes, there is a but) I can't help but wish that they had two soundtracks for Wicked.  Idina Menzel has a superb voice, as does Kristin Chenoweth... but I found Stephanie J. Block's voice more suitable as Elphaba.  Ms. Block's voice has a meatiness, a certain wickedness that the beautiful voice of Ms. Menzel (who has such a pretty sweetness on the edge of voice) just doesn't seem to reflect Elphaba.  Ms. Block's passion can be felt under your very skin when she sings.  She embodied Elphaba in every aspect of the word.  Truly, Ms. Block is a very talented lady.  Kendra Kassebaum, who played such a cute Glinda (the Ga is silent) also won over my heart. But Ms. Chenoweth I find has a stronger voice then Ms. Kassebaum.  And Carol Kane and David Garrison were also a thrill to see! This musical touches the humanity in us all.  Admit it, deep down, you can sympathize with (if not find a little of yourself inside) Elphaba.  I'll beg and plead it here to the music gods!  Pah-lease, put out a second CD for Wicked with the Chicago Tour Cast!!!!  Please, please, please!  We can call it a study in comparative casts and productions. :)  ~ but remember, \\"black is the new pink!\\"
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Buble has got to be the best voice in music today!! Whether he sings 'covers' or his beautiful self-penned \\"Home\\" this boy delivers the goods. <br />To see him perform at the Borgata recently was a delight. Consumate pro on stage, with humor, emotion and God Given talent, Buble has IT!!!!!! <br />I had the opportunity to speak with him briefly after his show and I found myself talking to a true gentleman --- I was lost for words (at least at first) and he comforted me and made fun of himself. What a treat. <br />So, if you want to make a purchase of a great c.d., this is the one. I recommend it to those who enjoy the likes of Connick or recent Stewart and all the legends like Sinatra. <br />You can't miss with this man...............................

0066620996|4.0|Because Jim Collins writes such a great deal about the research supporting this book, this review will focus on the validity of, and possible flaws in, that research. <br /> <br />Although apparently thorough, Collins' research process is questionable at a number of points. He limited his pool of companies to \\"Fortune 500\\" listees (p 220), he excluded companies without an \\"obvious shift to breakthrough performance\\" (p 222), he eliminated Coca-Cola and Pepsico for not substantially exceeding their industry (p 227) rather than considering that these two dominating companies may have driven the strong industry performance, he improperly applies the scientific method, and he appears to have ranked acquisitions subjectively (p 259-260). These combine to weaken his otherwise strong argument about the nature of \\"good to great\\" companies. <br /> <br />Limiting the pool to only Fortune-listed companies is justified by the statement that the Fortune list only includes large companies, and that most Fortune firms are publicly traded (this was an implicit screen). However, many publicly traded companies of a reasonable size have not been listed in Fortune, or may have come on and then fallen off the list in years he did not survey (Collins only looked at the 1965, 1975, 1985, and 1995 lists). By limiting his \\"company universe\\" in this way, Collins created the possibility of a selection bias. <br /> <br />It is entirely possible that a company's stock value would show a gradual shift from \\"good\\" to \\"great\\", and in fact 19 companies from the limited universe did. If Collins had included the 18 of these companies with no other elimination criterion, it is possible that his finding may have been different. For example, he compared the company performance to the apparent breakthrough in the hatching of a chicken from an egg. In these additional companies no breakthrough was present, but a gradual shift did occur. Perhaps he might have asked why some companies appeared to make the gradual shift, while for others a breakthrough appeared. <br /> <br />Collins' exclusion of Pepsico and Coca-Cola appears to reflect a misconception of industry v. company performance. The truth is that an industry is simply a grouping of like companies, and if the larger industry players are successful the industry will appear to be successful. As dominant companies, it should be expected that Coca-Cola and Pepsico would not substantially exceed their industry performance; rather that they would pull the industry average up with them. <br /> <br />Finally, Collins improperly applies the scientific method. He emphasizes repeatedly that his recommendations are not based on any preconcieved notion, but solely upon research. This actually undercuts, rather than strengthens his case. Proper application of the scientific method would call for his hypotheses to be tested against data, but he has turned this backwards and created hypotheses to fit his data. One way around this might have been to split the study group in two, using one group to establish the hypotheses, and then \\"testing\\" the hypotheses against the other group. Since it is obviously too late for that, another good possibility would be to use the additional years of data that have accrued since he completed this study to identify new \\"good to great\\" companies, and test the hypotheses against them. <br /> <br />Despite these shortcomings in methodology, Good to Great is well formatted and provides highly useable suggestions for how to make the transition in any type of organization. Possibly the most helpful sections were those in which Collins gave non-business \\"good to great\\" examples, such as his wife in the Ironman triathlon and the high school track team, because they demonstrated the broader applicability of his findings.
B0002X314C|4.0|I am really enjoying John Legend's debut.  And, based on the reviews on this website, people I have been talking to, and magazine critiques, so is everyone else.  John Legend offers both fast and slow songs on the album, and even some guest appearances by Snoop and Kanye West.  One of the things I don't like about John is that is voice is very scratchy, and that irritates me to the point of no return.  However, his voice is very soulful, and he can't hide the fact that he started out in the church.  Another issue I have with this album is that John does not seem to have a problem with cheating.  If you don't believe me, listen to \\"Alright\\", \\"Number One\\" and \\"She Don't Have to Know\\".  John's song lyrics are good but not intense, and the production on this album is on the simple side.  There's definitely nothing special about it, but for some reason, I think he and the producers wanted it that way.  Because he is so often compared to Alicia Keys, who usually keeps her production rather simple, John went for the same thing.<br /><br /> John does a great job carrying his songs.  His ad libs are really creative.  \\"Used to Love You\\" is the album's first single.  The song is about being fed up with trying to satisfy the person you're with.  The song was a hit and fans were ready for more, and that's just what John gave them.  It's safe to say he blew fans away with his second single entitled \\"Ordinary People\\".  This song caught all generations' ears, from baby girls to great grandmothers.  This song received a LOT of airplay and was a huge success.  It was a great idea for John to release these two singles because they are very similar to the rest of the album.  \\"Refuge\\" is definitely an album highlight.  John does a nice job with the vocals and the production is nice as well.  \\"Live it Up\\" is another great song which showcases John's voice nicely.  This is a slower 70's-esque song about finally making it and not having to struggle anymore.  This song makes one glad they supported John in the first place.  This song shows John is grateful for his success and he does not take it for granted.  \\"Alright\\" is an OK song with some rather weird production.  This song says simply that it's OK to cheat.  \\"Number One\\" samples The Staple Singers \\"Let's Do It Again\\".  I really like this song.  The sample compliments the song.  John is telling his love that, although he cheats, she's his number one.  Kanye delivers a nice rap, as always.<br /><br /> I highly recommend this album to anyone, any age.  This album is timeless and I have talked to so many people who are in love with this CD. Let's Get Lifted!<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. Ordinary People<br /><br />2.

B000001EL7|4.0|Some fine material here!  \\"Love Gun\\" includes classics such as \\"I Stole Your Love\\", \\"Christine Sixteen\\", and \\"Shock Me\\", the first track featuring vocals by Ace.  \\"Got Love For Sale\\" is also good, as is \\"Almost Human\\", with vocals by Gene and a slight Jimi Hendrix-esque sound to it (which isn't surprising, as the album was produced by Eddie Kramer, who also produced Hendrix). <br /> <br />A good entry in the KISS catalog.
0743454537|5.0|Picoult is the type of writer who makes you think \\"I wish I had written that\\", or, more to the point, \\"I wish I COULD write like that\\".  It all seems so effortless to her to create three-dimensional characters and the intricate and sometimes delicate dynamics between them.  Whether you love or hate them, Picoult's characters always make you feel something, and her novels are worth reading for that aspect alone. <br /> <br />Having said that, the subject matter is also deftly handled by the author, and presented in many voices, which allows you to see the issue from all sides.  The plot is full of twists and turns, but (with one obvious exception) those twists have been there all along and are revealed a little at a time to the reader. <br /> <br />One word about the ending - yes, it is shocking, but it is consistent with the story.  Kate didn't ask to get cancer.  Anna didn't ask to be born to be a donor.  We readers didn't ask for that ending, but sometimes life shakes you up like that. <br />
B000001ELR|4.0|I love the production on this one -- I've read that special attention was paid to give the drums a thunderous sound, and it was worth it.  KISS were trying to get back to their roots on this one and try to reclaim some of the credibility they'd lost during the late 70's when they moved towards the mainstream and became a merchandising juggernaut.  And they've done a good job here.  While I wouldn't say there are a lot of *great* songs, I consider every song at least a *good* song, with the exception of \\"Rock And Roll Hell\\".  My personal favorite is \\"War Machine\\", the album closer -- an exceptional track with vocals by Gene, and co-written by Bryan Adams (yes, THAT Bryan Adams -- but the song sounds nothing like anything else I've heard from him). <br /> <br />Oh, and despite Ace being on the cover, he's not on this album.  For the most part, it's Vinnie Vincent.  Sometime in the late 80's, they re-released this album with a different cover, featuring the \\"Asylum\\" era KISS (with Bruce Kulick on the cover...who ALSO does not play on this album!).
B0000033P2|5.0|Listening to this album is like staring at a painter's masterpiece; the sheer beauty and power is overwhelming at any time.  Keith Emerson is both eloquent and freaky, smooth and jarring; Carl Palmer's percussion is shockingly fast, adaptable, and disturbing; and to bring it together is Greg Lake's constant bass and smooth, deep, powerful (and sexy) voice.   <br /> <br />While this album has its moments, it is not nearly as dark as their debut recording.  Here, \\"Endless Enigma\\" parts one and two combined with \\"Fugue\\" provide a powerfully stimulating intro.  Following is \\"From the Beginning,\\" which is a mellow and moody turn.  \\"The Sheriff\\" is a goofy ditty that moves into \\"Hoedown,\\" one of their more remembered songs.  \\"Trilogy\\" and \\"Abandon's Bolero\\" are perfect vehicles for Emerson to display his genius.  \\"Living Sin\\" is another dark, more mainstream rocker, but the lyrics are a bit silly at times. <br /> <br />What an amazing album; however, \\"Trilogy\\" is not a good intro album for ELP.  I'd start either with \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" or their self-titled debut.  Both are more easily accessible, musically speaking, and no less satisfying.
B000001FQQ|3.0|\\"Hot In The Shade\\" is actually an album of demo tracks that were deemed good enough/polished up enough to comprise an album.  The result is mixed: there are some very good songs, along with some songs I could really do without.  The songs I like, I tend to like a lot; the songs I dislike, I REALLY dislike!  This is an uneven album of 15 songs, which could have been a very good album of 10 or 11 songs had they just left off some of the less stellar tracks. <br /> <br />Is it worth picking up?  Yes.  But if you're new to KISS, I'd recommend something like \\"Love Gun\\" instead, or \\"Double Platinum\\" as a good best-of type album.
B00005JMXX|5.0|I feel that the main chacter and his focus is to keep his word to his son that he will come to him. I have watched this movie three time now and get a deep satisfication in seeing the action unfold about the hardships these characters go through. written by Tom Murray, Texas
B000001ELL|4.0|I know it's not popular to say this, but this is actually one of my favorite KISS albums.  I wasn't a KISS fan during the 70's -- I was still a bit young -- so I didn't hear this album until the late 80's.  At that point, KISS were a different band, and it was easier to look back on their older material with a more detached perspective -- I wasn't expecting anything in particular from each album.  That being said, this is a very good, consistent album.  Sure, \\"I Was Made For Lovin You\\" is goofy, but the rest of the album is great.  \\"Dirty Living\\" is the only song Peter plays on (and sings lead vocals on), and it is my all-time favorite Peter Criss song.  Some of my favorite Ace songs are here as well.  Plus \\"Sure Know Something\\" and \\"Charisma\\", two other favorites of mine. <br /> <br />Give this one a chance -- it may not be popular, but it's still some fine work.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This may be the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed on video.<br /><br />Things in the Western world today are a lot more Indian and  Spiritual because of George, though he didn't give a hoot to take credit for his subtle, strong influence.  The musical sensibility he brought to the world - with the Beatles, Ravi Shankhar, solo and beyond - will never be lost on any who know music as a direct line to our own divinity, or \\"all of heaven we have below\\" as essayist Joseph Addison once wrote.<br /><br />The many high points on this video are each worth the price of the product alone. Just one example is Tom Petty and the Heartbreaker's rendition of George's beautiful \\"I Need You,\\" originally done on the HELP LP.  You'll feel hugged by Ringo, Paul, the Indian Orchestra, Eric Clapton, George's family and all.
0812550706|5.0|Wow wow wow wow wow...amazing. Everything shocked me, but the originality stunned me most of all. The creativity of this sci-fi/fnatasy book is impressive, and it alone desrves five stars. How hard is it to find original books?<br /><br />the characters are also impressive, but what got be really besides the originality was the cleverness. Card is a genius, I will tell you. He made Ender (the main character) smart, but not with the tactics other authors use. Ender was honestly awesome...<br /><br />You would NOT like this book if some language will tweek you, and, if you are under the age of 13, I do not reccommend it...<br /><br />But otherwise, this book is awesome and all sci-fi fans need to read it. It will have you roting for Ender (I will not spoil why, but it is because of the fantasic characterization). Once again, ingenius and shockingly great.<br /><br />Bravo, Bravo, Orson Scott Card....you have just given sic-fi a new breath of life (and hope.)
B00008XEP5|3.0|i found out about them like most people i know through, Lars Ulrich.  i was blown a way at this LP because the guitar work was like a black sabbath meets metallica kind of thing.  there were so many catchy riffs and the lead work is amazing.  the one problem is a big one and its the reason i gave it a three.  the vocals .  what is up with that.  i know not all bands have great metal vocalists but this sounds like The Cure or some emo band.  well, just look past it and you be blown away too. <br /> <br />
B00079018K|4.0|take some stone roses-some stereo mc's some primal scream and stones-mix in some oasis and most british music from the last decade or so and kasabian's debut is one of the stronger in recent memory. A great cd littered with singles and songs that grow better with each listen. Great loops-electronic squelches and rock riffs with a lazy confident voice over top- one of the few records and bands to get excited about. kasabian sound cocky and hungry which always makes for great rock and prove once again the uk is still the king when it comes to new bands.<br /><br />the recording is solid- the band also has been getting stellar live reviews- and this album is in my topten for the year.
0743454537|4.0|Thanks to all for the reviews, but I must disagree with ARabidReader about the ending.  I will admit the ending was highly improbable, but it has some things to say about organ donation that are hard to say in fiction without some contrivance.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Although I doubt it will be topped. This album has just about everything in it that I hope for in an album. Wonderful imaginative lyrics, terrific guitar work, a useful backing of a strings section, and a singer with a beautiful voice. I am going to actually buy the album this weekend, because I want the Superman cover, cause it's cool and the next one is probably gonna suck. Anyways, if you like folk music then you'll love this album.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Celtic Woman is absolutely mesmerizing.<br /><br />It's not a show for hardcore Celtic music fans, who might not appreciate the stylized sets and lush orchestration.  Rather, it seems aimed at those whose introduction to Celtic music was in Riverdance.<br /><br />Any fan of any type of music will be amazed at the voices of the featured vocalists.  They effortlessly glide through vocal ranges that make you think, \\"This is what angels must sound like.\\"  The songs run the range from soothing to haunting, with some lively moments in between.<br /><br />Despite the polish, Celtic rythms and melodies are at the core of the entire show.  This may introduce many more people to Celtic music.  Hopefully, it will make them want to hear more.<br /><br />I bought both the CD and the DVD.  While the music stands on its own, it is GREATLY enhanced by the visuals of the show.  That, in no small part, is due to the fact that all of these women are absolutely beautiful.
B0009NCQJ6|1.0|Explosive is not new.  It's a mixture of other CD's they made already.  Come on Ladies???  It's time for something BRAND NEW AND FRESH.
B000001FS3|5.0|Okay...so there's \\"Where the Streets...\\", \\"I Still Haven't Found...\\", \\"With or Without You\\", and \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\" and the first three classics are presented back-to-back-, no wonder one reader said that it was a work of pure beauty in an era of pure sh**...this was out in 1987 amidst all the cheesy tunes of the 80s...a true timeless classic from a band that was regarded by many as probably the best band in history
B000002J1S|5.0|I'm a long-time Genesis fan and I've listened to every Genesis album ever recorded and this is undoubtedly the best one.  One of the greatest and most under-rated rock albums of all time. This is because it as at once extremely unique in it's sound, but too far out for the average listener.  It's a work of absolute brilliance.  Even better than Nursery Cryme (my second recommendation).  If you're looking for pop music look elsewhere.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It's all about perspective I guess and different tastes reflect different reviews...but songs like \\"Square One\\", \\"What If\\", \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"The Hardest Part\\" kinda reminded me when I was 12 and I listened to \\"Where the Streets...\\", \\"I Still Haven't Found...\\" and \\"With or Without You\\"...Does it take more than three or four great tracks to make a CD a timeless classic? No...you actually know Great & Awesome music when you hear it...we should congratulate Coldplay on this effort...there are moments when you fly in space while listening to some parts of these songs...these four brilliant boys have made history...one moment of glory is worth a lifetime...and there are more than one moment of glory on X & Y...they have touched the sky and maybe it's time to go down now...but hey...Bono, the Edge and the Irish kids touched the sky with the Joshua Tree...and that's the Hardest Part...but that's enough...and that's what music and even life are all about
B000819PKC|5.0|Three weeks before it was released I had the oportunity to listen to the full CD and own it. Obviously, my first impression was like...DAMNNNNN...THIS CD REALLY ROCKS!!!  <br />Now that it is available (at last) for all of the fans out there it's great because they can now experience what Dynamite is really made up of. Right from the start we got this new kinda style FEELS JUST LIKE IT SHOULD...which is ok, then we have DYNAMITE... which is pure funk and disco style...bass lines everywhere...this song should be released as a single, it's a must!!! When it comes to summer time vibes then SEVEN DAYS IN SUNNY JUNE is the perfect option...good lyrics and harmonious tunes...ELECTRIC MISTRESS...is an electrifying dance experience...you'll start dancing right from the very first second of the song...STARCHILD...pure disco style...relevant lyrics...just great...LOVE BLIND...kinda strange ... gets better with a few listenings though...TALULAH...here we go back in time...you will definetely remember the Emergency On Planet Earth and The Return Of The Space Cowboy eras...delicious!!!...GIVE HATE A CHANCE...was the first song of the cd that I listened to and I couldn't have chosen a better song...you have to feel these bass lines on your own to tell how great this song is...definetely a high point in the album...excelent and relevant lyrics without a doubt...I started dancing by myself right away...lol...delightful...my ideal single for the future...one of my faves of course...WORLD THAT HE WANTS...mmm...the political touch...typical Jay Kay lyrics...BLACK DEVIL CAR...it's nice...fast lyrics though...HOT TEQUILA BROWN...good song...as simple as that...BEATBOX...really tells what rhythm is made up of...and to finish we have TIME WON'T WAIT...definetely one of my faves...you can imagine Jamiroquai and Earth Wind & Fire together in the studio and it wouldn't seem weird at all...percussion everywhere...bass lines...great lyrics...what can be more perfect than that????  <br />So there it is, a whole new Jamiroquai experience for us to live. Thank you Jamiroquai for these amazing vibes...good music and fun is guaranteed...as always!!!!!
B00005JNJT|4.0|Well do not get me wrong, I loved the movie, but It looks like they always have to change something and come up with different versions of what is on the books,(comic books, etc,),wich it is by the way, the Batman that we know and have known for more than 40 years. First they killed The Joker, of course they had to do it because someone thought that it would be a great idea to have him know who Batman really was and that he, (The joker) killed his parents? Come on` are this people really writing this stuff and nobody has a word to say about it before it goes into production? and they continued vandalizing \\"The Classics\\".   <br />Now we have a New Batman, so far the Best in years..but already they keep on vaporazing the Villians,(well, at least we know one has the means to come back from the dead,)but Batman`s mentor,\\"Ducard\\" does not have a Lazarus Pit to bath on. <br />Seriously, you don`t kill the arch nemesis, the bad guys, the criminal minds, think about Freddy Krueger and Jason, they always come back for more and people go to the see their movies without thinking if this is real or not. The word it`s Enterteinment, so forget about the \\"non initiated\\" and if they are going to see the movies thinking or believing \\"this could be real\\". The writers should keep it \\"real\\" by sticking to the classics. <br />Yeah! I know, I am a weirdo. I am a comic book reader, a nerd, a geek, whatever. So is Frank Miller,Jeph Loeb and others, (no offense meant guys) <br />Next movie should be \\"The Long Halloween\\", but \\"The Man who Laughs\\" is also a possibility, think about it. Thank you.
B0007O38F8|1.0|First off before i get into my review I just gotta say 50 u are crazy to even mention your name with 2Pac, Biggie, JayZ, or Nas.  Those four Rappers are some of the greatest MC's ever to live and 50 your just an average MC or as Jadakiss said a party rapper.  Anyways after listening to the album a few things stood out.  50 constantly raps about the same things...money, hoes, ice, cars, and clubs.  It grows tirer-sum when he just raps about the same things most other rappers rap about and the lyrics are not that witty.  Last time I checked hip-hop was about lyrics and those are sadly missing from here.  Another thing that bothers me is he disses Ja Rule for makin bitch music...50...thats what ur album is about.  50 really has not progressed anywhere since his last album Get Rich Or Die Tryin.  The only song I feel on the album in Baltimore Love Thing.  50 really has dropped off since his G-Unit buddies started droppin CD's.  If you wanna hear 50 back in the day when he has better lyrics and better songs check out \\"power of the dollar\\" or \\"guess whos back\\".
B000002L99|4.0|Van Halen released 5150 in 1986. At the time, they were coming off their most successful album 1984 which went to #2 and spawned three Top 20 hits including their first #1 hit in \\"Jump.\\" Despite their success, tensions continued to boil between lead singer David Lee Roth and guitarist Edward Van Halen which would result in Roth leaving the band to pursue a solo career. The band chose Sammy Hagar, already a successful solo artist who had hit singles with \\"Your Love Is Driving Me Crazy\\" and \\"I Can't Drive 55\\", as their new lead singer and recorded 5150. Despite his success, the band was taking a huge gamble. Would the band still be vital without David Lee Roth? The answer as displayed on 5150 was a resounding yes.<br /><br />5150 is the sound of Van Halen having fun again. Easily their most enjoyable album since Women and Children First, it is their only album since Roth left that captures some of the charisma and spirit of their early work as tunes such as \\"Good Enough\\" and the hyperactive \\"Get Up\\" clearly illustrate. \\"Summer Nights\\" is an excellent track with a killer groove while \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" is the most radio friendly of the harder tracks, featuring a memorable riff and a catchy chorus. Also worth noting is that Alex Van Halen's drumming is very busy throughout, especially on \\"Get Up\\" and \\"Good Enough\\", and is more creative than on their later efforts. The title track and \\"Outside\\" are also strong tracks. Which takes us to the hit singles. As on 1984, the band continued to pursue their direction of adding pop elements to their hard rock sound. The bouncy \\"Why This Can't Be Love?\\", the synth pop of \\"Dreams\\", and the ballad \\"Love Walks In\\" were all hit singles where keyboards replaced the guitar as the main instrument. While \\"Why Can't This Be Love?\\" is extremely catchy and still sounds fresh, \\"Dreams\\" and \\"Love Walks In\\" haven't aged nearly as well despite containing a nice balance of synth and guitar. Having said that, this is easily their best album post-Roth as each album after this would get a little bit worse before the band completely bottomed out on Van Halen 3.st-Roth as each album after this would get a little bit worse before the band completely bottomed out on Van Halen 3.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I thought of getting the CD, but I wanted to see this performance for myself. When it arrived today I put it on the big screen and turned up the surround sound and enjoyed a wonderful superb performance.  My son's really enjoyed it too and want the CD. I don't know how any music loving person could give this a bad review, unless there not all there.  Yes you can tell that the DVD has been edited and dubbed like any concert DVD. This is especially noticable when Meav has her microphone on her left cheek and then it shows on her right later in the same song. Some words don't look synced, but who really cares, it's a great DVD and I would buy it again in a second. I'm sure the LIVE concert would be great to see in person.
0393035158|5.0|Before reading this book, Sam Harris' intentions should be taken into consideration. In the epilogue, Harris writes: \\"My goal in writing this book has been to help close the door to a certain style of irrationality.\\" To help expand upon what he means by this I would also like to add that during a Q&A session broadcasted through C-SPAN, he stated that he does not believe that the book in itself is going to change the world. Instead, through it he is calling out to individuals whose minds are not too deluded by dogma to see that religion, now more than ever, poses a devastating threat to civilization. As weapons of mass destruction become more accessible and more powerful, religious fundamentalists become more dangerous. He quotes the statement of physicist Martin Rees: <br /> <br />\\"We are entering an era where a single person can, by one clandestine act, cause millions of deaths or render a city uninhabitable for years...\\" <br /> <br />This book serves as a wake-up call for those of us who are utterly terrified by this realization. Nothing will change unless the first step is taken. Harris asserts that \\"freedom of belief\\" is a myth and that rational individuals can no longer allow unjustified beliefs to thrive without being subject to the same inquiry we make into historical and mathematical claims. If \\"freedom of speech\\" means anything, we shouldn't be afraid to discuss the validity of religious beliefs. <br /> <br />Don't let the title mislead you, by no means is this book attacking all spiritual belief. Harris establishes that faith is a particular type of belief, that which is unjustified. He compares religious dogma with mysticism, displaying how spirituality need not be irrational. <br /> <br />I feel that this is a book best fit for rationalists/athiests. If you are such an individual, this is an extremely valuable read. However, progressive religious minds may find some value in it as well.
6305079811|5.0|A life long Flash Gordon fan (as a kid I'd get up in the middle of the night to see the Buster Crabbe serials on TV), I was thrilled when this version of the Alex Raymond comic strip was released in theatres, with high expectations since it was just a few years after Star Wars.  I wasn't disappointed, though I wished they had made a more serious film.  They certainly assembled the talent, the international cast including Max Von Sydow as Ming, Topol, and other established stars.<br />It all commences when Ming the Merciless (Von Sydow), Emperor of the planet Mongo, decides to destroy Earth with phony natural disasters (hot hail, etc.).  Dr. Hans Zarkov (Topol) is the only human who's figured out the cause of increasing disasters, and considered a crackpot.  But he has his own spaceship (very pulpish), and when football hero Flash Gordon (Sam Jones) and reporter Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) crash their plane into his lab, Zarkov kidnaps the pair to help him blast off in a last ditch effort to save the Earth.  Upon their arrival on Mongo  (in this version, more a fantasy realm than solid planet), the three are immediately seized by Ming.  As they attempt to escape and then overthrow the tyrant, they tangle with Prince Barin (Timothy Dalton) in the Forest Kingdom Arboria, King Vultan (Brian Blessed) of the Hawkmen, and Ming's daughter Princess Aura (Ornella Muti), trying to forge alliances with each.<br />The film is very colorful and imaginative (and noisy), with more of a comic-strip feel than the serials, but sometimes that almost appears parodic, especially when some of these fine actors ham it up.  I like Jones as Flash, but he seems a bit timid compared to Buster Crabbe's take-charge portrayal, so Crabbe will remain the definitive Gordon.  Probably the best thing about the film is the colorful art direction, with spaceships reminiscent of old pulp covers - if you liked Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow, it has some of that nostalgia.  Personally I think the rock score by Queen hurt more than helped, in a sense making the film less serious and less faithful, but that's just opinion - others think it makes the movie more fun.<br />Fortunately you can enjoy Flash Gordon on whichever level you choose.  There's action, humor, romance, and fun, if not realistic, special effects.  In a spirited way it's faithful to the strip, if not literally.<br />Too bad it's not available on DVD anymore, but I found one in an auction.score by Queen hurt more than helped, in a sense making the film less serious and less faithful, but that's just opinion - others think it makes the movie more fun.

0808514121|5.0|This book describes suffering fleshed out. This book tears apart the meaning of humanity, and leaves the meaning of the world to rest on individual shoulders of toliling men and women. This book slaps you in the face and ignores social behaviors that say, \\"privacy, please!\\" This book is, very possibly, THE BEST.  <br /> <br />Only in darkness does mankind duel with their bare toughness. Only in darkness does manking face reality - one that says, \\"who is with you? Look into heaven! Who do you see there?\\" The soul squirms. \\"Tell me the truth!!!\\" screeches nothingness, and suddenly man looks into the blank twinking of the heavens, and sees NOTHING.  <br />Light depends on love. The love of God allowed man to be able to come back to \\"live with him\\" happily for all eternity. We are to sacrifice ourselves to him; no questions asked. He loves us - why should we not love him? The weight of pleasant, painless joy depends on existence of something compassionate in heaven. But, strip it all away. Feel the blows of the cautious parental hand, the constraints of truth, the pressures of life. Feel the pains in happiness, the perverseness in striving for perfection. Look at the dark side to find a truth that will kill you, for in blackness there is no such thing as heaven or hell. The blackness will not lie. <br /> <br />This is what East of Eden is all about: satisfaction. <br /> <br />Interesting pieces from the book: <br /> <br />\\"You are one of the rare people who can separate your observation from your preconception. You see what is, where most people see what they expect.\\" <br /> <br />\\"There are no ugly questions except those clothed in condescension.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The ways of sins are curious. I guess if a man had to shuck off everything he had, inside and out, he'd manage to hide a few little sins somewhere for his own discomfort. They're the last things we'll give up.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Humility must be a good thing, since it's a rare man who has not a piece of it, but whenyou look at humbleness it's hard to see where its value rests until you grant that it is a pleasurable pain and very precious.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Suffering - I wonder has it been properly looked at.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Sometimes a silence tells the most.\\" <br /> <br />\\"It's easy to say she was bad, but there is little reason unless you know why.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Chuckling - the sound he made when any force in the world defeated him. He had an idea that even when beaten he could steal a little victory by laughing at defeat.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Act out being alive, like in a play. And after a while, a long while, it will be true.\\" <br /> <br />\\"You're going to pass something down no matter what you do or of you do nothing. Even if you let yourself go fallow, the weeds will grow and the brambles. Something will grow.\\" <br /> <br />\\"It is easy out of laziness, out of weakness, to throw oneself into the lap of deity and saying, \\"I couldn't help it; the way was set.\\" But think of the glory of the choice! That makes a man a man. A cat has no choice, a bee must make honey. There's no godliness there.\\" <br /> <br />\\"I believe there are techniques of the human mind whereby, in its dark deep, problems are examined, rejected or accepted. Such activities sometimes concern facets a man does not know he has. How often one goes to sleep troubled and full of pain, not knowing what causes the travil, and in the morning a whole new direction and a clearness is there, maybe the result of the black reasoning. And again there are mornings when ecstasy bubbles in the blood, and the stomach and chest are tight and electric with joy, and nothing in the thoughts to justify it or cause it.\\" <br /> <br />\\"There is more beauty in the truth even it if is a dreadful beauty.\\" <br /> <br />And more... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />she who is no longer the Angel of Music (sorry this is so long) <br /> <br />
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This concert dvd has incredible sound and visual quality, and captures the band on a really good night. EVERY member plays great and for once the camera doesn't move around like it's guided by a speed freak - the edits are not so fast that you can't enjoy individual band members playing for more than a few seconds. My main point in writing this is to alert anyone who has ever been a fan of Joe Walsh that they have to see this dvd. I've been a fan since the James Gang days back in the late 60's, and I've never really followed the Eagles that closely. He gets to perform quite a few solo numbers on this dvd, yet calling them \\"solo\\" isn't right because the Eagles blend in and make them fit right in with the set and it seems so natural and seamless with the rest of the set. Joe's new song, \\"One Day At A Time\\" about his newly found sobriety is particulary touching, and he and the band give ripping performances of \\"Rocky Mtn. Way\\", \\"Life's Been Good\\", \\"In The City\\", plus two songs from the James Gang days - \\"Funk #49\\" and \\"Walk Away\\"!!! Joe's guitar playing never sounded better, and, like I said, the rest of the Eagles back him perfectly and I was out of my seat for most of this dvd. A keeper, and one to pass along to folks like me that almost missed it.
B000002BBY|4.0|Although as an album, this is certainly not the best album of all time, the songs make up for it, which makes it the best album of all time without a doubt. <br />If you can understand that, as confusing as it sounds. <br /> <br />And how can you say people \\"ARE JERKS!\\" you've never meet them, thats the problem with people today, bad attitudes!!! <br />
B0000025F7|4.0|Ladies and gentlemen this is it! This is where Michael's solo career officially began. Before the he was constantly in the tabloids, before Neverland, before utter superstardom, there was this. How did Michael attain a level of stardom achieved by almost no one else? He produced songs like no one else, sang like no one else, and danced like no one else. Let's face it, there's no mistaking an MJ song for anything else. Michael has increasingly written and produced his own music as his career progressed. Michael co-produced three songs on this album, \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\", \\"Workin Day and Night\\", and \\"Get On The Floor\\". This album spawned some timeless classics. \\"Don't Stop...\\" and \\"Rock with You\\" are probably the most indelible from this album, being the ones that we still hear most from this album today. But don't let that fool you, this album is chock full of good songs. \\"Working Day and Night\\" is a personal favorite of mine. I first heard it when watching one of his concerts and I've loved it ever since. It is one of several high-energy dance songs on the album. Most of the songs on \\"Off The Wall\\" are great dance/party songs, being uptempo, feel-good songs. I wasn't born until '84, so I wasn't around when this was THE album, but I find it especially refreshing when compared against a lot of today's popular music. For one thing, you actually get to hear real instruments on this cd, as opposed to todays usual mix of synthesizer generated sounds and beats. This cd comes from an era where you actually had to be a good singer to get a contract. There wasn't all this digital \\"help\\" that is given to many of today's stars. The likes of Britney, Hillary Duff, and Lindsay Lohan couldn't have made it without that! Michael was in the nascent stage of forming his style with this disc, so there are much fewer \\"hee-hee's\\" and \\"Aaoww!'s\\" on this work. \\"She's Out of My Life\\" is a deeply soulful song beautifully sung. This is a great addition for any collection, whether you are already a Michael Jackson fan or not.
B00004T8RK|5.0|This is Pearl jams best album, the entire album plays very strongly, stronger than any other Pearl Jam albums. <br />Its sound is alot more in the same vein as their 1995 released single \\"I Got ID\\" and some of their Vitolagy album songs(Immortality, Not For You, Corduroy, Betterman), but even better on the whole. <br /> <br />
1573300403|5.0|If I could only pick one dvd of music videos from all of my favorite artists, this would be what I would pick. This dvd is the real enchilada. It comes packed with MJ's most recent and cutting-edge videos, along with several classic videos that brought him to be known not only as the king of pop, but the also the king of music videos. He set a deadly precedent from early on in his career, with such videos as \\"Beat It\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Smooth Criminal\\", and of course, \\"Thriller\\". It is tough to consistently live up to such great expectations when so many prior videos have been legendary, but I feel Michael certainly did not fail to please with the newer videos that went with his \\"HIStory\\" CD. Most of us at one point or another have seen the majority of Michael's older films. This dvd offers a look at several of his videos that were rarely seen on television in the U.S. \\"Scream\\", a duet with sister Janet, is probably the best known short film from the HIStory cd, and rightfully so. The special effects and dancing is simply amazing, and the song itself is quite intoxicating. Another great video that is lesser known is \\"They Don't Care About Us\\". This song features an awesome percussion beat along with rocking guitar sounds. The video is directed by Spike Lee and features the Brazilian percussion group Olodum. It was shot on the streets of Brazil, and is a very powerful video. Perhaps the most emotionally moving video is \\"Earth Song\\", which is a deep and soulful song, mourning for the Earth as we do various things to destroy it. The video shows various kinds of destruction, ranging from the clearing of rain forests, industrial pollution, poaching, and war. The presentation is absolutely astounding.  <br />The video works to show how several factors come together to impact people and animals all over the world. I am not a man to shed a tear very often, but this video was a tear-jerker even for me. The video is beautiful, with the overall message that there is still timeto turn things around. \\"Stranger In Moscow\\" is yet another marvelous video, trading dancing and blatant messages for a more subtle symbolism. Even in the absence of MJ's signature dancing, this is a more than satisfying video. \\"You Are Not Alone\\" is another of his newer works on this dvd. This is a poignant song that really showcases the range of Michael's voice. The video features his then-wife Lisa Marie Presley. It is a solid video, but this reviewer feels the video doesn't quite do the song justice. The two live performances included on this dvd are a special treat. The \\"Billie Jean\\" performance from the Apollo is when Michael first debuted the moonwalk. In this day when we are used to seeing a singer on stage accompanied by tons of backup dancers, it is refreshing to see Michael, on the stage alone delivering a stellar performance, singing and dancing his heart out. The 15 minute MTV performance is yet another jaw-dropping show. Michael performs a medley of \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\", \\"Scream\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"Black or White\\"(featuring Slash) and \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\". He delivers full performances of \\"Dangerous\\" (mesmerizing dancing!)and \\"You Are Not Alone\\". The newer videos which are overall stellar, combined with some of Michael's best earlier works make this an unrivaled music dvd. Morever, there is all kinds of music here. Some songs make you want to get out of your chair and dance, some are smooth and relaxing, some are very thought-provoking, some are rebellious, and some are even lugubrious. Overall, it is a tempting schmear for the emotions and the senses. The vast majority of the videos are as awesome to see as they are to hear. Even if you are not an MJ fan, the entertainment value is still outstanding with this dvd. If you aren't sure why Michael is regarded as the King of Pop, watching this dvd should leave you with no questions.
B000002LVB|3.0|After headphoning the first VU album every morning for weeks this summer, I decided to get another from their catalog. <br />Sadly, Loaded does not get close to the brilliance of their debut. John Cale was apparently the guy who brought the \\"art\\" and experimentation to the party.  His influence is sorely missed on this collection of straight forward rock and roll songs, as are the poetry of Reed's lyrics and subject matter from the first album.  Gone as well are the weird, trance-inducing instrumental lines of songs like \\"Waiting for the Man\\" and \\"Venus in Furs\\".  Reed ends up repeating the line of a chorus or the title of the song in more than one track. <br /> <br />The only reason this album gets 3 stars is that it contains a couple rock standards, Sweet Jane (which has a heavenly guitar intro that backs into the familiar strummed chords of the main riff), and Rock and Roll.
0451457994|5.0|I admit I watched the movie before I read this book and although certain parts of the movie greatly amused me I was confused beyond belief. The book is far better. It explains everything in detail and really gives you a sense of bizarre isolation in a way.<br /><br />Hal the computer still remains my favorite character and in the book his murderous tendencies are not only explained in detail but also have reasoning behind them. Not only this but the monolith and the apes seen in the first scene of the movie are not nearly as ambiguous and they do connect very well with the rest of the story in the book. Nothing is left dangling in the air for the reader to figure out on their own. The ending is the strangest most thought-provoking finish I have read in any book. It really gave me a sense of wonder.<br /><br />A quick but very good read I suggest this to not only those who like science fiction but also those that like to ponder the big questions.
B0009R1T7M|3.0|Musically, Sufjan Stevens is very gifted. Lyrically, he is just as gifted. But his music has an ulterior motive; to spread the Christian message. Does he mean to do this overtly or covertly? I do not know. I suspect he, like a majority of us in the United States, are steeped in Christianity. I, like most, grew up immersed in it. It took me a long time to come to grips with fact that organized religion was a scam-and even longer to admit it. When I was Sufjan's age, I was still battling with the guilt of questioning the inevitability of a vengeful creator. I do not think Sufjan is anywhere close to that point. <br /> <br />Sufjan Stevens' music is very attractive. Offbeat, unique and introspective but, at its heart, a subtle attempt to proselytize. In spite of his ability, he hearkens to a place that is comfortable-what he knows and knows deeply.  <br /> <br />Should you avoid this album (and Greetings from Michigan and Seven Swans) because it carries a subtle Christian message? No. He makes good music. Should you accept his message because it reaffirms what you have been taught? Definitely not.  <br /> <br />Illinoise (like his other albums) is safe although it seems \\"edgy\\". It subverts the instinct of a thinking person. Do not be fooled
0553275976|5.0|Bonfire of the Vanities was the first Tom Wolfe novel I read, not knowing anything about the author, and I was not disappointed! Had I known the book was about an upper class investment banker in the eighties who runs down some black kid in the Bronx I would have never picked it up but once I started reading it the little plotline blurb seemed so insufficient to describe it.<br /><br />This book seems to have a real talent for spelunking into the darker unseemly depths of human society but at the same time you're staring at the pages half horrified you're also sucked further into the story trying to figure out the whys. I don't think I've ever read a book with a main character as unlikable as this one but at the same time there are moments when you're sitting back thinking how sad it all is, or smiling at some little trifling piece of humanity that shows through. All the characters are keenly humanized. Nothing is held back, and I believe that's the key to this book's success. It catches not only the great human struggle but also the great societal struggle as well with wondrous complexity.<br /><br />I'm in the process of reading this book the second time and I must say you do get something new out of each little scene the second time around. I really enjoyed this book for not only showing the negatives of the human experience but also little tinges of the positives in various poignant scenes.

B00005UOKM|5.0|'Dialogue' is one of the most listenable of the mid-sixties avante-garde Blue Note dates.  Comparisons are drawn here and elsewhere to Dolphy's 'Out to Lunch' and Hill's 'Point of Departure', but 'Dialogue' has more tonality and rhythm to balance the dissonance.  This disc finds its way into my CD player five times as often as the other two mentioned.  *  If it appeals, you might seek out Hutcherson's 'Happenings', currently available on Amazon as a moderately priced Japanese import.  Herbie Hancock features, and his playing is as interesting here as it is anywhere - the feel is more intense than on 'Dialogue', the startling cerise cover art a fair indication of what awaits.  'Vertigo' by Jackie McLean features similarly inspired piano work from Herbie, while McLean's 'One Step Beyond' has the leader in fabulous 'in and out' form, and Hutcherson bringing along a variety of intriguing moods - this album is available, with 24bit remastering, through Mosaic records in their Grachan Moncur 'Select' release; another McLean disc, 'Destination Out', available readily as an RVG remaster, has Hutcherson at his most intricate and surprising, the sparse arrangements giving room to hear all his nuances.    *  Another great date with Hutcherson and Hill is the latter's 'Judgment!'; and there's also Big John Patton's disc, 'Let 'Em Roll', which just might be his best, with Hutcherson, Grant Green, and Otis Finch on drums.  Most of the discs with Hutcherson as leader are excellent, albeit less surprising than 'Dialogue' and 'Happenings'; 'Patterns' has some particularly beautiful moments; 'The Kicker' and 'Stick-Up' are solid, the latter showcasing Joe Henderson's talent; 'Oblique', with Herbie again, is due to be re-released on the 2nd of August, 2005; the magic is lost, however, on 'Medina', the release of these sessions having been deferred for good reason.  *  'Dialogue' wound rank in my top ten of all Blue Notes.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|How to make a really bad movie.    1) Have a script that literally makes no sense.    2) Have a music video director who has no clue on what he's trying to film, let alone have a clue on what the movie is really about.    3) Cast the film with two great and versatile actors (Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou) and then cast the central character with one of the worse actors around ( Keanu Reeves) and have him throw the film off balance with his lack of talent.     4) Take a great story from an acclaimed comic book and rape it for a cheap thrill.    What do you get with all of this? A film called Constantine, one of the worse films of this year.    Not worth it's weight on DvD
B00000I8NC|5.0|These days when every post-rock back to come about is compared to Godspeed You Black Emperor!, it is important to remember just how masterful this band is.<br /><br />This isn't just your soft-loud-soft-endsong post-rock formula here.  This goes beyond that and actually feel liks it \\"goes somewhere\\".  It is truly worthy of the term \\"orchestrated rock\\".<br /><br />The term \\"layered\\" is truly warranted here.  So many times, these new 4-piece post-rock bands (which I'm not bashing by any means), are awared terms like \\"wall of sound\\" and \\"layered\\", that aren't truly warranted.  To me, the terms \\"layered\\" and \\"wall of sound\\" aren't worthy of something that is merely loud and covered in layers of delay and distortion.  Godspeed truly earn these terms however.  I love to just sit and listen to the layers of guitar parts (3 guitarists), violin, cello, percussion, and bass.  It all works together so well.<br /><br />This isn't just pretty melodies that start out quietly, get loud, get quiet and end--it has a much more hearfelt and thought-out feel than mono, mogwai, or explosions in the sky.
B0002858YS|4.0|This album is definitely worth a look. The Killers blend alot of 80s sounds into a modern rock album. On some tracks they even sound a little John Lennonish. If you are into rock of both the past and present you will enjoy this one!

B0006L16N8|5.0|So many people keep saying to me, \\"X&Y is the worst Coldplay album.\\" Well guess what: It's supposed to be. <br /> <br />X&Y is an elaborate satire of sex and chromosomes. As we all know, X&Y chromosomes create a little boy. The singers in this band are men. Therefore, they are saying, \\"Hey, I wish we had gotten an X chromosome instead, so we were women.\\" By labelling their crappy album X&Y, they are saying, \\"Hey, X&Y chromosomes are crappy, too - let's be girls.\\" <br /> <br />SEE? They are telling us that they ACKNOWLEDGE their album is a piece of garbage - and so are men! <br /> <br />I wonder what Gwyneth Paltrow thinks. If she's not careful, she may soon be married to Christine instead of Chris.
B00008ADPF|5.0|ok, i have both this album and SSU and have really liked them both, i am supprised to find a lot of hate going around (i have not even looked at any reviews/websites etc before today), i don't buy music magazeins watch music channels and am not a mad obsessive fan of any group, i do listen to a lot of radio and have to say i have heard almest nothing of nickelback whilst doing so, it may just be that i am in the UK and there is not much media intereast here, i also know little of music politics etc to be honest dont really care, all i can say is that i love my music especialy rock and own more cd then most dj's and free from the influence of most media and public opinion i have decided i like the band and love this album!!!!! <br /> <br />reading between the lines haters appear to be judging because they are a band and do what bands do, yes they are signed, yes they do make money and yes they do play to a certain style, in case aybody hadn't notice so do all the others!!!!!! or the industry wouldnt exist as it dose
B000002B1M|3.0|hey yall. i jus wanna tell any nas fans who dont have this album why its not worth coppin. basically nas has fell off since illmatic and thats the end of it. street deams, nas is coming(beat by dre),affirmative action, the message, i gave you power and take it in blood are dope. the rest is ugly like oprah. all nas jointz since his debut hav been weak. nas is (mostly) on point lyrically but 70% of the beats hes rapped on since his debut hav been wack as f**k. trackmasters,L.E.S., Salaam remi and others hav all ruined nas songs recently so get illmatic and avoid nas until he comes up with sumthin dope with the beats.  i can give nas sum advice : get preem, pete rock, extra p, q tip, alchemist, havoc, timbaland to do ur beats and youll definetly make a classic, but this is so so and a big let down for illmatic fans. This is the 2nd best album nas did and its worth coppin. Also stop makin a big deal about i gave you power when organized confuzion already invented that concept.

B00005K9LM|5.0|I bought this album in 1984 and I remember thinking it was a good record.Now that I have bought it on CD in 2005 Im amazed at how good it really was.This is not only a good CD its exellant.Every song is good making it JPs best record in my opinion with British Steel a close second.If you want a awesome JP CD that has no weak spots this is it.

B0006IIPIK|3.0|If you've ever wondered how one of those old science fiction movies or serials with the cheesy props and terrible special effects would look if they were dressed in modern effects and props, your curiosity can now be satisfied. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow takes the look and scientific incongruity of such old movies and covers them with a thick coat of modern gloss. The look of the movie is incredibly attractive, as are the pretty actors cast in the main roles.<br /><br />Being an homage to such older movies must have provided the movie's creators with a quandry in regards to the plot. If they wanted to  maintain the feel of their inspiration, the plot had to stay light and relatively simple. If they wanted to inspire and captivate the modern audience, they would need to shoehorn in a more complex plot. They chose the former and I'm not sure that was a bad decision. There is only so much a movie like this can accomplish without failing to hit the mark. And it does hit its mark. It is what it aspires to be (a modern remake of an old style and genre).<br /><br />However, I think that a lot of viewers wish it could have been more than it was and, indeed, it doesn't reach levels of greatness because it'd be tough to be both a gripping and compelling story and a good homage to its target.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie for what it was and felt it was extremely well done. I'd like to give it 3 1/2 stars but the ratings don't allow for that. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow may be too light a meal for those looking for something with a little more heft but if you're looking for something fun and slightly absurd to watch, you will likely enjoy it.

0425152251|5.0|\\"Sophie's World\\" by Jostein Gaarder, is subtitled 'A Novel About the History of Philosophy', which may or may not grab the reader's attention.  Through a series of letters to a fourteen-year-old girl, a mysterious man named Alberto Knox offers her a free course in philosophy.  He starts the course by delivering questions to Sophie that make her think of who she is and how the world was made.  Alberto then takes her through a brief course on the history of philosophy, from Greek to modern times.  He manages to shake Sophie out of her mundane existence: he compares humans to living on a rabbit's back, content to remain buried way down in the fur, and never questioning or climbing up to the top to examine the world around us, the way philosophers do.<br /><br />Having taken several philosophy classes in college, much of the information covered about various philosophers was not new - but it was a nice, well-organized and summarized review.  Gaarder's Knox peppers his lectures on philosophers with questions and examples that make it easy for the reader, and his fourteen-year-old pupil, to understand.  Yet there is much more than a simple philosophy course taking place.  Soon enough, Sophie and her teacher receive mysterious messages that cause them to question their very existence and the world around them.  Gaarder manages to turn the narrative upside down, requiring even more thought and questioning from the reader so that they might comprehend what is going on in the story.<br /><br />One does not have to agree with every philosophy presented in the book in order to enjoy it: in fact, one would be very confused indeed if they agreed with every notion every philosopher ever set forth.  Gaarder makes the novel an interactive experience, since many of Sophie's questions would be asked by the reader, and the examples put things into perspective.  Gaarder has a fascinating imagination that sweeps the novel along at a brisk pace, especially when he causes the reader to question the very plausibility of the where he is taking the characters he has created.  Learning about philosophy has never been so exhilarating; here's to never sinking down into the rabbit's fur again.question the very plausibility of the where he is taking the characters he has created.

B0000TB014|5.0|Michael Jackson hasn't released any new singles recently but he's been compiling all his old hits. Having owned the other Greatest hits already, I had no surprises when watching this DVD. Some of the videos weren't really compiled together with his Greatest Hits DVD like \\"Dirty Diana\\" and \\"Man in the Mirror\\".<br /><br />Even though his music has been going on and on in his albums, same stuff compiled together, you still enjoy the great beats and dance movements. Not to mention, his great voice which can really put up the beat. One great song was \\"Earth Song\\". It was like a movie. well, it makes you feel like it's a movie with all those war scenes and destroyed forests. It was just superb.<br /><br />This DVD is still great and Michael is still legendary to me. His dance moves and voice can really boost up the spirit.

B00003CXCD|5.0|No one, in my humble opinion, has ever lit up the screen like Audrey Hepburn. She was a complex mix of sexy woman, young ingenue, and naive un-worldly girl. Audrey was appealing to both men and women, as women wanted to be her, and men wanted to be with her. She was beautiful like a china doll, and every word out of her mouth had depth and resonance. She was non-threatening and seemed to be a truly genuine human being. In her later years she became a goodwill ambassador for Unicef. She continued her charitable duties until she died.     This movie was the first starring role for the fabulous Audrey Hepburn. Her performance was sparkly, radiant, spontaneous and magical. Obviously the members of the Academy of Arts and Sciences agreed, as Audrey won an academy award for her performance in this movie.    In a nutshell this story is about a princess who feels unfullfilled and \\"stressed-out\\" with her life. While in Rome she decides to leave the castle to explore Rome on her own. Before she leaves however, her doctor gives her a sedative to calm her down. When the princess leaves the castle it appears as though she is drunk. That is how Gregory Pecks character first sees her. In the beginning he is not aware that Audreys character is the princess. He will eventually figure it out.     There are a multitude of adventures that occur, and there are so many magical scenes in this movie it would be impossible to name them all. I will name a couple of my favorite scenes though. I LOVE the scene when Audrey and Gregory are at the docks dancing, and a fight breaks out. In the chaos that ensues, Audrey smashes a guitar over the head of one of the party-goers. She grins with delight. I also enjoy the scene where Audrey and Gregory are tempting the fates with the \\"Mouth of truth\\" statue that bites off the hands of those who are telling a lie. No matter how many times I watch this movie, I still tense up at that scene to see if her hand will be bitten or not.    This movie is such aclassic, and with a less talented cast the movie could have come across as a bit cheesy. But with the spectacular talents of Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn and Eddie Albert, this movie was and is one of the greatest movies in Hollywood history. I LOVE this movie and I hope you will too.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I love this movie! It was so ingenius and clever. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give amazing perfomances. At first I thought maybe the actors were too old to be playing these characters that seem too young and crazy, but I think they pulled it off perfectly. I've read in movie reviews that there was a lack of chemistry between the two, but I think they compliment each other nicely and you can tell that they love each other. <br /> <br />Okay so Carrey plays Joel, this sweet and somewhat boring guy who meets Clementine, this amazingly off beat woman with colored hair. She's crazy, he's crazy, so they get together! It's very cute and it seems to have this \\"Garden State\\" tone.  <br /> <br />The whole movie mostly consists in Joel's head when these tech guys come and try to erase his Clementine memories. I was reading another review that said how this movie really isn't that great if you take away all the special effects, which is true, but the effects are apart of the movie and it makes it great. The scenes where Joel is trying to hide Clementine are so cutesy and they work well. It's a very interesting concept, the ability to erase memories and it's a clever theme for the movie. <br /> <br />There's a twist later on when we learn that Kirsten Dunst's character, Mary, the receptionist at the memory wiping company, has also had her memories erased. It was a nice shocker. So Mary had her memories of the memory erasing doctor erased after a bad relationship and now she's overcome by confusion. She, realizing how much she regrets it, sends back all these files explaining everything to everyone. <br /> <br />It's confusing, but once you think it over, it clicks.  <br /> <br />This is an amazing movie that you should watch at least once. It's clever, funny, cute, smart, and amazingly awesome. Great scenes and acting.
B000056JYB|3.0|`Blind Faith' is the name of both the four member `super group' composed of Steve Winwood of Traffic, Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker of Cream, and Rick Grech from nowhere in particular and the only album this amalgam ever produced.<br /><br />The original LP of six tracks was as good or maybe just a little better than the efforts of Traffic and Cream up to that point. With Steve Winwood's distinctive vocals and organ, plus the fact that three out of the six tracks were written by Winwood makes the whole album sound much more like a Traffic jazz fest than a Cream blues session. Out of the six tracks, at least three, Winwood's `Can't Find My Way Home' and `Sea of Joy' and Clapton's `Presence of the Lord' have become rock classics, which both artists redo in many of their contemporary concerts. And, Winwood's opening `Had to Cry Today' is no slouch. Buddy Holly's `Well All Right' is well done, except that I may prefer Holly's original `1950s' rendition. The last track, Ginger Baker's long `Do What You Like' which took up most of the second half of the original LP is a classic rock drum solo jam which survives all the best efforts of Frank Zappa to parody into oblivion.<br /><br />The notes to my CD release describe `Blind Faith' as the first supergroup. I beg to differ, in that Cream was billed as a supergroup at least two years before it's members broke up and reformed as Blind Faith. In fact, the whole point of the name `Cream' was to signify these three members were the `cream of the crop'.<br /><br />The original Blind Faith recording is a genuine classic and deserves to be in everyone's `best albums of the `60s collection.<br /><br />The `Deluxe Edition' adds a second CD of four jams, each at about 15 minutes long and five tracks to the original CD with a 15 minute acoustic jam, an electric version of `Can't Find My Way Home', a number by Sam Myers named `Sleeping on the Ground' with two versions, and a Steve Winwood number named `Time Winds'.<br /><br />All of this material demonstrates again that there is a reason this stuff was not previously released. It is simply second rate material whose only value is that it gives one the sense of being a fly on the wall of the studio when this historic group goes through its paces.<br /><br />Unless you listen very carefully to the hour's worth of jamming on the second CD, you could mistake it for a very good effort by a good garage band. The musicianship is tight, but very repetitive and relatively uninteresting. The additional material on the first CD is slightly more interesting, but nothing remotely as valuable as the original first five tracks.<br /><br />All the extra stuff has a nominal value as background music to doing something mindless such as pulling weeds from the garden. Otherwise, it lost most of its value about a year or two after it was recorded, as soon as the principles went on to do better things.All of this material demonstrates again that there is a reason this stuff was not previously released.

B00006AG5N|3.0|I hated how this compilation was marketed: \\"Before there was gangsta rap, before 'bling-bling', there was Elvis\\". What nonsense, but you do what you have to sell the same music over and over again. The truth is, I had resisted purchasing any Presley cds because I never liked their track listings. When this and \\"2nd To None\\" came out, there was no question that the time had finally come. I don't mind the remixes; there are a couple of mix points which are unwelcome, but overall the sound quality is good. Not every song is a winner, but credit the record company for stuffing each cd to capacity with tracks. Elvis was as much the King Of Rock as Michael Jackson was the King Of Pop - which is to say, hardly at all. In any event, this is a compilation worth getting. You know who's really amazing? EXTREME ELVIS.

B0009HLDFU|4.0|i really love foo fighters, is one of my favorite bands... this disk really rocks and grows on you with every new listen. The only problem and thats why i give it four stars is the copy protection, for those who buy it original is really uncomfortable having to do a lot of things so we can put it in our ipod... really sucks. And for those who love piracy this is not an obstacle, finally they would find the way to rip it. So dont waste your time pissin' off your real fans... dont do this again!!! <br /> <br />musically talking i love both cds, #1 really rocks, and #2 shows other side of the foo's which i happen to love (great dave's voice) hope keep doing this more often...without throwing away their rocking soul... nirvana: foo fighters rule!

I adore good electronica and its ability to transport the listener to places they've never been before.  This album combines that experience with a human voice, and not just any voice, a soulful, expressive, dynamic voice.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend listening to this album for anyone.  It transcends genres and labels.  I hope they release another soon...
B00001QEE7|5.0|Disney's renaissance saw a return to form after the disappointing Oliver and Company. The Little Mermaid not only saw the return of the great studio as a major driving force in cinematic imagination but also rejuvenated the art of animation itself. Released in the summer of 1989, Little Mermaid tells the classic Hans Christian Andersen tale of a mermaid who yearns to explore the world above the ocean. Inspired by the work of David Towns and Michael Peraza, the film became one of the most articulately- composed and artfully contrived animated novel adaptations in cinema history. The late Alan Menken's influence on the film's fantastically catchy underwater songs like 'Under the Sea' is all too obvious, but that's great homage to a truly gifted musician. The icing on the cake would be winning 2 Academy awards for best song and best musical score. Not bad for a animated musical and a great shot in the arm.<br /><br />Understandably the head honchos were concerned with the source material, considering the fable's tragic finale, but a couple of tweaks, a new ending and a singing Jamaican crab later, and the film was ready to set sail. The animation took a great leap from Disney's so-so input in the mid 80s, where the studio had reached a creativity apathetic nadir. If you want to argue (And you shouldn't) it should be noted that like Aladdin, the love struck mermaid is somewhat underwritten, surrounded by dancing fish she somewhat fails to reach the emotional peak the character needs to sell the ending. But thankfully there are some quiet scenes amidst the frenetic musical numbers. The voice actors are great, especially Jodi Benson as Ariel the title mermaid. From here the studio would go on to the even more impressive Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. Arguably their finest hour, it is undoubtedly one of their most impressive and creative tales.
B00069L0XG|5.0|Not many video game based movies turn out well, but Resident Evil is an exception to the rule.  The second rule is that a sequel is never as good as the original... Apocalypse breaks this rule.  Although losing Michelle Rodriguez was dissapointing, the second movie obviously has a bigger budget and really lives up as a sequel.  Now.. this movie IS based on a video game.. so if realistic plots and the norm is what you expect, you won't like this movie.  But the original video game scared the bejesus out of me at the time and the movie sticks true to the game...  especially the zombie dogs!!  So have fun with these 2 movies, and they will prove to entertain you for sure!
B0006IIPIK|3.0|I don't expect too much from a retro-sci fi movie that is being hailed mostly for the visual effects, and I like a cinematic movie as much as the next person, but I can only take so many plot holes you can drive a truck through. The world is under attack and there is only one plane to fight them, even though he returns to a base full of them (which again remain on the ground when the base comes under attack, come on, Pearl Harbor was bad, but at least there was more than one plane in the air). In New York, the Sky Captain does a vertical loop to escape his pursuers and then flies down an alley with... a dead end? (I'm reminded of Spock in Star Trek II '[the enemy] does appear to be exhibiting a two dimensional manner of thinking') Polly rides along with Sky Captain through zany twists and turns in New York, confidently giving him directions, then wigs out as he starts a dive. The robots are everywhere (in one room of the mad scientists lair), except when they are conveniently not (in the room next door, they can knock over New York, but not a locked door). Despite a raging battle outside the lair as the hero's fight their way in, once inside they find no one has been alerted to their possible presence. In short, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is nothing special, but good friday night fun.

B0001I561E|4.0|After the phenomenal success of The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, Disney's third modern revolutionary animated film would go for lighter territory but still retain the emotional punch that made their previous two films work so well. The memorable music from Howard Ashman and Alan Menkin drives the movie forward comedically while being careful not to sacrifice story potential. There is however a critical flaw in Aladdin, the title star is outshone by the fast-talking, shape-shifting genie. The romance between Princess Jasmine and the young street rat is sidelined and sometimes roughly composed. Robin Williams is frenetic and fun, and that's great, but some more time and effort should have been spent on the driving force of the film, The genie is a critical character, but it's a story of romance, the genie should have been given less to roam. One of the abandoned songs for the film 'Proud of your Boy' where Aladdin ruminates on his poverty-ruined life, should have been used, because it really shows where he's coming from. Some fascinating and imaginative ideas were unfortunatly ditched in favour of Genie laughs. Of course comedy has always been an essential ingredient in their films, but in this case, there could have been more emotion. Perhaps there should have been more time to work out the kinks before being rushed into cinemas. The animation is mostly smooth and expertly-crafted, despite some obvious rush jobs in the second half, where some second-rate animation becomes apparent. Regardless of its flaws, Aladdin saw Disney rake in even more money, with the box office success even more impressive than Beauty and the Beast. The DVD extras are impressive and the digital transfer is top-notch. An essential for Disney fans.

B00003CXB4|5.0|The Little Mermaid was fantastic, Beauty and the Beast was emotionally impressive, Aladdin was rib-ticklingly funny, but Disney's third film in the animation renaissance saw the studio take its first big gamble. The Lion King tells a moving story of a young lion cub banished to exile when his scheming uncle frames the young prince for his father's death. With enough Shakespearean references to shake a stick at, The Lion King is perhaps the studio's most well-written movie. While adapting classic storybook favorites like Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty has its challenges, the cracks really show when a completely original story is composed quickly and thrown at the screen with very little emotional input (Fox and the Hound, anyone?) Therefore, its equally impressive and innovative having a story presented in such a fashion as to curry favor not only from young audiences but hardened film buffs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas, James Irons and James Earl Jones all do really well with their well-written characters, and the inspired pairing of Elton John and James Horner would give the studio its best soundtrack to date. The animation sparkles with well-time nuances and the voice cast is excellent. Then of course, there's Timon and Pumbaa, voiced by the fantastic Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, whose characters became so popular Disney made a TV series about the fast-talking meerkat and the flatulent warthog. Their signature song, 'Hakuna Matata' entered its own little fan base and zeitgeist pop culture. But the original is still the best example of expertly crafted imagination that still entertains 11 years later. Well done Disney, this is not only an expertly crafted movie, but also a modern masterpiece.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS <br /> <br />Mystic River is a misunderstood masterpiece. <br /> <br />Several critics hailed the film as a modern Greek tragedy, but at its core it is really an opposite kind of tragedy. The protagonists of the ancient tragedies were punished by the gods for the sin of hubris. Overweening pride and arrogance caused the heroes' downfall. The characters in Mystic River, however, especially Dave, are punished (and punished repeatedly) for being weak and for lacking self-confidence. Worse, the punishment is passed down to the next generation of innocent children, through no fault of their own.  Witness Dave's son, portrayed as a timid little stripling, exactly the type of child likely to get picked on by everyone and perhaps even molested by pedophiles: He is left fatherless at the end, to be raised entirely by the weak, anxious, stupid Celeste, the only woman the ruinously victimized Dave could find for a mate. You just know that things are going to turn out badly for this child. His only sin was having Dave and Celeste for a father and mother. <br /> <br />Mystic River is more accurately described as a Darwinian tragedy, much bleaker and far more pitiless than anything dreamed up by Aeschylus or Sophocles. <br /> <br />If critics found any fault at all, it was with the coda that contained Laura Linney's out-of-nowhere Lady Macbeth speech and the depressing little neighborhood parade. Most critics thought the film should have ended with the scene of Jimmy and Sean standing in the street, recalling their friend's abduction twenty-five years earlier. This ending would have suggested that perhaps they had sinned by not protecting their weaker friend. But no. Eastwood's ending reinforces the film's pitiless Darwinian ethos: Jimmy's feelings of guilt over murdering his innocent friend Dave are dispelled by his wife's passionate sociobiological sermon, finally freeing him to become the dominant alpha male of the tribe; Celeste is left wandering lost and forlorn among the tribal gathering, shunned for being weak and stupid; and then these contemptible figures recede into ant-like insignificance as the camera moves away from this cruel, squalid spectacle and sinks into the river, a mystic river that flows on forever, utterly heedless of human suffering. Fade to black. <br /> <br />Such a cheery little movie. I'm surprised it did so well in tragedy-resistant America.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|The Little Mermaid saw Disney back on from, but Beauty and the Beast cemented the studio's reputation as a major driving force in revolutionary animation. The film would go on to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film. A pity that the recent new category of 'Best animated film' wasn't around back in 1991, Beauty and the Beast would have been a shoe in. Regardless, this is a landmark film that deserves all the praise that critics give it, and it is also my No.1 favorite animated movie. The style is particularly intriguing, playing more like live action rather than the cartoony antics of 70s Disney. Intentional no doubt, and it works to a high standard. The voice work is notably impressive, especially in the new song created for the DVD `Human Again'. It is indeed a rare thing to experience a perfect movie, especially in the era of heartless 3D rubbish like Shark Tale and Madagascar. Again Alan Menkin and Howard Ashman's influence in story and songwriting is to the fore, and the fantastically detailed animation is a treat to the eye. So much love and care has been put into this movie, and unlike previous offerings, Beast has a perfect blend of catchy songs, unforgettable characters and surprisingly emotionally driven drama. This is a true masterpiece.
B000000OAN|5.0|During the 70s Queen were one of the biggest bands around. Could you blame them? With their shameless theatrical bombast and equal propensity for blistering hard rock and vaudevillian camp, not to mention their instrumental prowess and Freddy Mercury's otherworldly voice, they  were what might be called the Ultimate Rock Band. I'm not saying they were the best of the best (there are half-a-dozen bands or more I'd rate above them); but if you wanted a blueprint for a great rock band, Queen would be it. And 1975's A Night at the Opera is generally considered their magnum opus.    \\"A Night at the Opera\\" of course derives from the Marx Brothers' classic madcap comedy, and it's not just a name check. The album's defining characteristic is its lofty operatic pretensions. This is most obvious and comes to a head in that overwrought masterpiece Bohemian Rhapsody, but even in heavier (like Death on Two Legs, the scathing opener) and lighter (such as the short-but-sweet Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon) the operatic aspirations are evident. The title inspiration also shines in the music's overwhelming camp as Freddie and the boys indulge heavily in the British music-hall tradition of the 20s and 30s. Queen were originally a hard rock band!     The songwriting itself is uniformly impressive as well. Freddie Mercury takes the spotlight with his vocal acrobatics and as the prime instigator of A Night at the Opera's bombast, holding the bulk of its song credits. But despite his prevalence Queen is very much an active unit - my two favourite songs on the disc, You're My Best Friend and '39, are by John Deacon and Brian May respectively. Queen are all first-rate musicians, of course: Brian May most obviously, with his guitar buzz as fluid as it is unique, though John Deacon is a bassist on the order of McCartney and Entwistle too. The fact that NO orchestra or choir was involved is all the more impressive - all this grandiloquence is entirely realized through layers and layers of instrumental overdubs and soaring, ornate vocal melodies supported by dense, measure-perfect harmonies.    The bonus tracks are nothing more than more modern remixes of I'm in Love with My Car and You're My Best friend - not significantly different, nothing to write home about.    After Bohemian Rhapsody has faded away the album closes out with a histrionic, tongue-in-cheek, self-aggrandizing performance of the British national anthem God Save the Queen, and that about says it for the album, and for Queen themselves. A Night at the Opera is a masterwork of ostentation and a classic.
B00005JM02|4.0|Its obvious why PIXAR hired Simpsons veteran to helm THE INCREDIBLES, the studio was dangerously close to becoming formulaic. While FINDING NEMO scored big with audiences and critics, it does wear telltale signs of over-plotting and forced jokes. Albert Brooks is great, teamed up with Ellen DeGeneres, making a comedic odd couple buddy team, and the 3D animation sparkles even more than Monsters Inc, but there are some badly-written fish tank scenes where some characters are ciphers and others aren't even introduced. The story shows Marlin, an over-protective dad who searches the ocean looking for his son Nemo, who is kidnapped by divers off the Australian coast. Along the way Marlin faces angler fish, sharks, seagulls and jellyfish in a desperate attempt to rescue his estranged son. Meanwhile Nemo gets stuck in a dentists' fishtank where Willem Dafoe's fish try to get the little clownfish back to his father. A somewhat original concept, but not exactly revolutionary. The buddy comedy movie sub genre is having its last nail pounded in as we speak, and while Nemo works on a comedic line, its core remains a cold as Tony Blair's nose. But then you could say \\"Hey, it's for kids so who cares?\\" And you'd be wrong. If John Lasseter and the boys at Pixar remember, they were the ones who made Toy Story, the first movie where adults could laugh along with the kids. Nemo gets filed above Monsters Inc and Bug's Life, but doesn't quite reach the comedic heights of Toy Story or The Incredibles.

6305165912|5.0|Here's my opinion. <br /> <br />When it comes to movies with funny and memorable lines, you can do no better than The Big Lebowski and a little known Canadian movie called Fubar. If you like Coen Brother's movies, then you'll also enjoy this movie. <br /> <br />Both movies have a lot in common, as they centre on non traditional protagonists. In the case of this movie, it tells the story of the pot smoking, white russian drinking character known as \\"The Dude\\", but I'm not going to go off and retell the story. Just watch this movie, and if you have the right sense of humour, you will enjoy the characters and jokes just as much as I do. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005MAM2|1.0|To begin with, this was suggested to me by 2 friends, both of which praised the story. I read a few online reviews here, thinking it to be an at the very least decent anime. But the truth is, this movie is mostly shock and gore, so I only suggest it if you are a horror film fan. The obscene images, including Tetsuo's gruesome hallucinations like milk-bleeding teddy monsters and tearing open and spilling your small intestine all over the sideway, are far too much for me.Also, I frown upon the post nuclear holocaust setting. You may like it, but I just find stories in that era unbearable.  If you're a member of that party, one who reads the above and thinks \\"Awesome, dude, let's go get this!\\" then by all means, you and dude can go get it. But if you're a tad more level-headed, I suggest something less, dare I say... mentally puncturing.  I left out one very vital piece of my review. If you read some of the reviews around here, you can piece together a rather odd picture.     It seems that AKIRA is about:  -Violence and attacking anyone who's in your way, as well as those who are not.    Does anyone here who is an AKIRA supporter mention Kaori? Do you even know who she is?  Kaori was Tetsuo's girlfriend, and she suffered severely throughout the movie. The enemy biker gang sexually abused her, Tetsuo didn't even care about her, and often shunned her. And in the final stages of the movie, he killed her. Yes, I know it's a spoiler, I apologize, but it's worth noting ahead of time.  Doesn't that phase you? Did you not see her blood squirt from her like a tomatoe? That was manslaughter, a massacre, an unatoned slaying, pure homicidal garbage. In my opinion, it was perhaps the most--the only emotionally effecting moment in the entire movie, and full worth noting in any review. She's the reason I give this movie only 1 star. It's not my idea of entertainment to watch someone hurt.  ...  That's all I have to say.
0312995423|3.0|Dan Brown does a great job of weaving little-known and often shocking realities into a fictional storyline.  However, his abilities as a revealer of little-known truths far outweigh his literary prowess.  While certainly a very interesting novel delving into the stark realities of privacy in the digital age, I found the plot twists to be rather predictable and even corny.  Overall the book is good, but certainly not as compelling as The Da Vinci Code or Angels &amp; Demons, and hardly a literary masterpiece.  A good choice for light summer reading.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|After two season of eroding ratings,the wrath of fans, and the ST franchise at an all time low, The Third season of the newly re-christened Star Trek Enterprise had taken the series into a new direction and produced some of the best episodes since the end of Deep Space Nine.   Taking it's cue from the second season finale The Expanse,the entire season deals with Captain Jonathan Archer's mission to stop the Xindi from destroying Earth with a superweapon after a devastating attack.Albiet,there were some weak semi stand alone episodes (Extinction,North Star,Carpenter St.,and E2),among classic episodes which ranks with some of the franchises best(Impulse,Twilight,Azati Prime/Damage,The Counsel/Countdown/Zero Time).Staff member Manny Coto was responsible for new direction which made for the most exciting season of the entire four year run.   Unfortunatly the exciting new direction couldn't produce ratings and was barely renewed after a fan based letter writing campaign,echoing the classic series fan fueled renewal.As a result,Coto became the official show runner which he produced one last season to correct the many continuety errors that has littered the series from the beginning.
B0007CY2RI|5.0|Leolo tells the story of a young boy living in a slum. He writes in a notebook scenes of his own bizarre family life plagued with sadness, his father's scatological obsessions, his mother's unconditional love for him and his sibling's slow but inevitable descent into madness, he falls in love with a beautiful girl that does dirty favors for his lecherous grandfather, so he decides to murder him and fails.     Each page he writes, he rips off from the notebook and throws it away. A junk-collector, to whom Leo refers as the \\"Verse Tamer\\" (the one who gave him his first and only book, that is used as a prop for a short table leg and that he reads in secret in the middle of the night) picks up these wrinkled pages and collects them, being the only one to realize the strength and beauty of the boy's prose.    As time goes by, Leolo begins to slip, having failed at grasping a scrap of reason in his sad life.    Leolo is a beautiful movie, photography and music blending well to wrap a heartbreaking story of dreams unborn.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|The O.C. season one had great supporting characters. Anna as Seth female equivolent and Luke, bad-ass turned good guy. Even Theresa was believable and good in the role as Ryan's old friend from Chino. Oliver was the one blemish, but even he got the desired effect. The writers wanted us to hate him, and we did! <br /> <br />Season 2 was characterised by bad characters. Not only were the characters bad, but they brought out the worst in all the main characters. Lindsey started out well, but soon it became all about Caleb and her relationship. They would have been better off not making her Caleb's daughter! Give her something! Not only that, but she turns Ryan into a pansy, who's only role is to try and play nice with Caleb. <br /> <br />DJ... I'll spend as much time on him as the writers did on his relationship with Marissa. <br /> <br />Rebecca returns, then leaves, then returns, leading the perfect husband Sandy astray. Nobody wanted her around. At least this relationship helped lead to Kirsten in the finale, Lindsey and DJ didn't even have any positive points! <br /> <br />Zach... wasn't bad, but he was just boring. he was not a great character. <br /> <br />Those characters really hurt the show. Now, on to what I did like. <br /> <br />Alex was the one exception. She was a good character, and I wish they had kept her around instead of Zach <br /> <br />Episodes 1-5, 14-18, and 21-24 are the best episodes, with the Rainy Day Women being the best. Seth and Summer get back together, and the worst two characters on the show left(Lindsey and Rebecca). <br /> <br />The last four episodes were brilliantly done. Everything that they had built all season come together. Some said it was predictable, but I thought it was powerful, because you actually believed it. Ryan was tired of Trey's crap, and went to call him on it. Kirsten had a rough year, and it pushed her alcoholism. <br /> <br />In season three, I hope to see more Seth and Summer, and a return to the great Sandy-Kirsten relationship of season one. I am also anxiously hoping for the return of Jimmy Cooper. Ryan and Marissa, I don't really care. In fact, I'd be fine if they broke up for good. They worked at first, they just don't work anymore. <br /> <br />Despite some rough spots, I still love the O.C. I hope season three takes a lighter tone, with Seth and Summer, Sandy and Kirsten, and the comeback of the Cooper family.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst films of the last 2 decades. <br />Reminiscent of 80s ultra-low quality scripts (video destined from day 1) with the only difference that it's filmed with puppets, it will basically insult any viewer with average intelligence within its first half hour (if you make it that long).. <br /> <br />   Strangely enough i was told to see this because it's \\"great satire\\" and because \\"it's tongue-in-cheek\\". If there is indeed any satire in this horrible disaster it's so well hidden that i didn't detect even the tiniest trace of it. <br /> <br />   All the attempts at humor are excruciatingly bad, the dialogue never surfaces above that between 6 year olds, and ultimately this can only serve as propaganda for the cerebrally dysfunctional. <br />   Avoid it no matter what lengths you need to go to.
B00005JN4H|5.0|I Like a lot although I didn't see it in cinema, rents it, that night I laughed for heap, and I advise this movie to have it in the collection of each person's DVD, any thing made by Queen Latifah is also very good, the persecution scenes are excellent, really everything is very amusing, also with Jimmy's participation who is very famous to work in Saturday Night Live, this it puts him a lot a touch but amusing, the director is also tim (Barbershop) that but we can request.
0064400557|5.0|once again, the book is a million times better than the movie. i get such a warm cozy feeling just seeing the front cover! i love the illustrations, i could just imagine holding little wilbur, the sweet little pig that the girl saved, and fed with a bottle - ahhhhhhh - so sweet.<br /><br />ok, i read it when i was a kid, long long ago, but i keep it on my book shelf, for the kids and grandkids.<br /><br />a CLASSIC. a must read. a book every youngster should read. if you didn't read it as a kid, read it NOW! it's not too late! read it out loud to a child, or anyone. just read it. and look at the pictures - adorable!<br /><br />the movie is just not the same. trust me.
B0000C1733|3.0|I have every single RHCP album and I love their older stuff from the 80's.  It has a completely different sound and energy they lack these days. I know this is a Greatest Hits cd, not a Best of, but I would have to recommend to hardcore fans like some others have to just burn your own Greatest Hits because it would be a waste to buy this if you have all the albums. Here are my true favorites from over the years: <br /> <br />True Men Don't Kill Coyotes <br />Green Heaven <br />Out In L.A. <br />American Ghost Dance <br />If You Want Me to Stay <br />Blackeyed Blonde <br />The Brother's Cup <br />Catholic School Girls Rule <br />Fight Like A Brave <br />Me and My Friends <br />Backwoods <br />Behind the Sun <br />No Chump Love Sucker <br />Walkin' On Down the Road <br />Good Time Boys <br />Subway to Venus <br />Knock Me Down <br />Taste the Pain <br />Johnny Kick a Hole in the Sky <br />Breaking the Girl <br />Suck My Kiss <br />Blood Sugar Sex Magic <br />Under the Bridge <br />Apache Rose Peacock  <br />Sir Psycho Sexy <br />My Friends <br />Tearjerker <br />One Hot Minute <br />All Around the World <br />Scar Tissue <br />Otherside <br />Californication <br />This Velvet Glove <br />By the Way <br />Can't Stop <br /> <br />This band has too many good songs from their whole career for one good cd.  I don't think any release would truly satisfy everyone. Make a compliation of your own.
B00005JKGK|5.0|i love this movie. i love the characters. this could be MY family (except I'm not Asian, no disrespect intended.)<br /><br />the mom, the daughter always trying to get approval. oh, boy, that is very close to home!  the couple where the tight a** husband keeps track of the money, down to the penny - that would be my brother-in-law, Jack. (sorry jack, but you know you are just like that!)<br /><br />i love the white boy one daughter brings home, and how he is so inept at the traditions and says something stupid about the dinner - so close to home that it was embarrassing to watch! (that would be my sister's husband, Peter)<br /><br />the pie, the peanut butter chocolate pie the girl makes for her soon to be ex - that would be my dear Norman's sister, Beth - she even makes a pie like that. and her man still left, even after she made him the pie.<br /><br />like i said, this could be my family - my dysfunctional family that i love to death!<br /><br />gotta see this movie - it's GREAT!!! funny, sweet, meaningful, a very good portrait of life. in any family.

B000001FHV|2.0|not entirely, but this album does sound dated, and thats not really a reason to dislike an album...Im pretty mixed with this album, it does feel a bit \\"disconnected\\" in my opinion. The review by Reviewer: Timothy Carey \\"vicvega2003\\" pretty much sums it up in my opinion; which ive quoted below if he doesn't mind. <br />  <br />\\"The Meat Puppets where one of the best bands of the 80s, but once they got signed off SST to a major label they seemed to have lost something. They didn't sell out, but a certain amount of soul present on \\"II\\" and \\"Up On the Sun\\" just wasn't there. The problem is they seemed to get swept up in the grunge explosion that happened. That isn't to say this is a terrible record. There are a few good songs, notibly their big hit \\"Backwater\\" amoung a few others. However, something just wasn't there. The lyrics weren't as funny or as emotional as before, and it leaves no lasting affect. I know there are many who disagree with me. If you like grunge such as Soundgarden and Mudhoney, you'll probably like this. If you like classic Puppets however, you'll not like this too much. Not bad by all means, just not that great either.\\"  <br />
B000000XCF|5.0|This is a great, classic album by CCR.  It has even more of a \\"Southern\\" influence than usual for the band.  There was only one single released from the album, but both sides became hits (\\"Down on the Corner\\" and \\"Fortunate Son\\").  All the other songs on the album are great, too, even the instumentals which people sometimes regard as \\"filler\\".  Highly recommended.
0316666343|2.0|This book wasn't that great at all. It was very hard for me to keep on reading it. It was somewhat boring and a slow read. There is a story line, but it is just plain boring. A couple of times I wanted to stop reading it, but I kept going hoping it would get better but it never did. Not a book I enjoyed.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I'm not a television watcher, so when I happened on this show it was only because my evening plans were cancelled last minute.  After the first episode, I was hooked and I couldn't wait for the next episode.  I realized that I was a fanatic when I sat down, comfortable and ready to discover a new episode of VM, and it was preempted by an awards show.  I was angry!  That's how captivating and involved this show has made me.  I am excited and anxious for the new season to arrive.  Trust me, this show is amazing and you won't regret spending your time with it.
B0009K7QZ8|2.0|For anyone who actually watches the show for good plotlines, scripting, and character development (and by that, I mean not just \\"OMG! Seth and Summer and Ryan and Marissa are totally meant to be!\\"), I think it's a joke to say that Season II even compared to Season I. When Season I ended, fans were left with actual compassion for the characters--and a strong desire to know what would happen to Seth (who was basically running away from his problems) and Ryan (who was forced into a life of fatherhood that he didn't really want). When Season II started, all those problems (Theresa's baby, Seth's irresponsibility, Seth's summer-stay with Luke) were magically resolved just so that the show could start more ridiculous plotlines. <br /> <br />The show also seems to have a problem with disappearing (and only sometimes reappearing) characters. Let's tally them up: Anna, Oliver, Caitlyn (Marissa's sister), Jimmy and Hailey ('til the Season II finale), Zach, Lindsay, Alex, DJ, Luke, Holly, Carter, Rebecca, Rachel (Sandy's partner in Season I), etc. I understand the need to focus a show around main characters, but it has become ridiculous. If the show actually accepted a new character as a new personality rather than a caricature or plot device (i.e. just to create a love triangle with Seth/Summer, Ryan/Marissa), then maybe plot development and natural arc-ing would come more easily. As it is, the show moves from plotline to plotline in a matter of episodes, never really giving fans any real closure and often dismissing plots just by shipping characters off to different cities. Not my idea of good writing, personally. <br /> <br />With that said, I do love \\"The OC\\". I think Season I presented a great show, and the dynamic between Seth and Ryan as friends (which was basically lost in Season II, thanks to Seth's personality taking a turn towards the extremely self-centered) was especially well-written. I hope that Season III returns to the strong writing that \\"The OC\\" once had, because I think it would be a shame to see Trey's death/Kirsten's alcoholism brushed off in favor of more Marissa/Ryan (ugh) pointless drama.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|I saw Constantine in theatres with my friend Nick who--as to no surprise to me--hated it.  I, on the other hand, loved it.  When I first saw the previews, I went nuts.  I am a major fan of all that goes bump in the night and love any kind of mythology involving fallen angels, devils, demons etc. This movie had all of them.  It was mostly Catholic thinking but I thought it worked.  Otherwise, why else would Keanu's character go around exorcising demons from little girls like he did in the opening scene.  Of course, the special effects were extra nice, especially hell--and I loved how Keanu got there.  I thought it was very specific in the hows, whys, etc of the film and especially when it came to explaining why something was this way or that.  I've never read the comic book but I'd like to.  And those who are upset that the movie wasn't like the comic book I'd like to say: When isn't it??  Usually, with few exceptions, the movies are practically nothing like the book or comic book versions.  Books are always better simply because there is no limit on how much detail the writer can put into it.  If they wanted to (and some do, like Stephen King) they could go on forever and a page describing something as silly as a chair, even when the chair has nothing to do with the real plot.  So, cut the film some slack.  They did the best they could and I think their best is pretty darn good.
0393035158|5.0|This book is well worth reading. Whether one finds it offensive or brutally honest, it prompts serious thought, which there seems to be a dearth of in the Age of Irrationalism.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|For anyone who is doubtful that films can be considered as an art form, this one will prove otherwise. Leni Riefenstahl is without doubt one of the most talented directors ever. She can capture both the sublime and the grandiose so movingly and beautifully, that one gasps for breath watching this movie. Indeed, she belonged to a party that among other things, threw babies alive into fiery pits. I am not here to judge her as a person. But, as a moviemaker, she is pure genius.
B00027JYLC|5.0|This cult classic has a reputation for being extremely creepy and unnerving; after watching this movie you will agree it's reputation is highly deserved. It must be seen to be believed (and even then you won't believe what you are seeing).  Some of the images in the film which will haunt you for the rest of your life. And don't try to be all politically correct by saying things like \\"I'm not going to watch a movie which makes fun of people less fortuante and exploits their deformities\\". \\"Freaks\\" is highly respectful of those deformities and it's some of the so called \\"normal\\" people in this movie who are the monsters.    The DVD is a very nice presensation with a clear picture and nice sound especially considering this film was made in 1932. Also, there is an hour long documentary about \\"freaks\\" with interviews which give fascinating insight into the the life of the whole carny culture.     HIGHLY RECOMMENDED but definately not for the weak and sensitive.

B000002UE9|5.0|Poison made a strong second album in Open Up and Say...Ahhh!  Tom Werman brought the best out of the band with his production. But the true stars here is Poison, as the band comes with undeniably catchy songs and a big, full rock and roll sound that matches well with their stage show.  Nothin' But A Good Time still rocks! The runaway woman song Fallen Angel is another solid song. I still love Every Rose Has Its Thorn and its acoustic feel.  And they did a solid cover of the Kenny Loggins/Messina song Your Mama Don't Dance that comes off in their own style without sounding so '70s nostalgic. Bret Michaels is charismatic in his singing and CC Deville's is just as wild in his lead guitars. Bobby Dall is just a superb bass guitarist and Rikki Rockett just kicks it on the drums.  The album's more heavy than the glamorous image of the debut. The other 6 songs like Look But You Can't Touch are addictive and catchy as the four hits.   This really made Poison a top band in the '80s and well receiving to this day!
B0006IIPIK|3.0|Adventure film in the tradition of Indiana Jones, or the serials from the 1940's.  Captures the feel of the 1930's. Not a great film, but not a film that pretends to be more than it is.  Paltrow & Law are good together.
B000002MY3|5.0|I always hated people who said stuff like \\"This album changed my life!\\". Well, now I`ve become one of those people myself. In an angry and depressed time, this album changed the way I looked at life. It`s angry, it`s happy, it`s sad, it`s funny, it`s optimistic. Not least, it`s HONEST! AND IT ROCKS! It`s got really good melodies. I LOVE her voice, it really suits the in-your-face lyrics, and personally, I find her yodeling (which some people feel is out-of-tune wailing) damn SEXY.

B0002BO0AS|4.0|\\"It's nice to know that some bands in the metalcore genre are in touch with their \\"roots\\", and that they'd like to pick up where Swedish death metal left off, but not to this point of monotony and whoredom. I will admit, they are talented at playing guitar, but that's easily surmounted with the fact that most of their material is ripped off. If an American band isn't ripping off At the Gates, they're stealing from In Flames. And the HORRIBLE, disgustingly sad part is that In Flames does not have nearly as much popularity in the United States as Unearth. They don't get any credit\\"...... <br /> <br />and whine whine whine. Now, set aside the above atypical sweedish fan boy BS and do yourself a favour, actually listen to the album and draw your own conclusions. Don't let some 15 year old wastehead trying to show how cool he is by trashing anything not inflames (whilst the kid probably never listened to a single track on this offering) put you off this cd.  <br />I saw Unearth recently at the sounds of the underground tour. There came their banner when I thought it would be OPETH's turn on the stage(whom i really wanted to see). Well I was pleasantly suprised. Every song these guys played brought down the roof and I didn't mind waiting for the swedes to take the stage after Unearth was done. I went out and grabbed this disk the next day and it plain out rocks. Yeah, I too have some inflames and I have all of Opeth etc...still, that preferene doesnt blind me like it does some. Good metal is good metal. See for yourself.
0792846443|5.0|It's about a writer who gets in a car accident during a snow storm and his so-called '#1 fan' rescues him and demands him to write a book for her. The writer puts together all of the clues he finds along the way and figures out what she's really trying to do. It's a great movie to grab a bowl of popcorn and watch from beginning to end without any breaks.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Most people think that Dream Theater's last album, Train of Thought' was not up to the standards of 'Six degrees' and way beneathe the mark that 'Images and words' set. i dissagree with this common disregard for what i think was a vital stepping stone for dream theater to morpth and find their next musical development. they found it with Octavarium, a truly inspiring and beautiful ninth album by the masters of prog metal. It is the induction of a symphony orchestra that really adds new layers and dimensions to their trademark riffery and stop start prog. The second song on the album 'the answer lies within' is a moving track which uses the full advantage of a stirring orchestra in favour of a masterbatory guitar solo. 'Sacrificed sons' is another song with a orchestrated climax. Now your probabely wondering why i only gave this album four stars. This album sounds to be as if Drema theater are so comfortable with their talent that they dont have to try, and in some respects they dont. But some of the songs do lack that integrity that really was thrown into the foreground with 'Scenes from a amemory'And although this is not a completely bad thing, i swear they have been taking lessons from other bands. The most commercial song. 'I walk beside you' is so U2 that if you close your eyes, you an almost see the glasses clad irishman leading the band through a predicatble chorus. The pastiches dont end either, oh no. The song 'never enough' sounds more muse than muse so! back to the positives now. The last 24 minute track 'Octavarium' It is a good track, very thoughtful and constant. It is a completely, and very surprising departure from 'A change of seasons' but it still makes for good listening, espeically with the four minute floydian opening.shine on you crazy diamind anyone? On the whole this album is extreme proof that the fivesome have not lost the magic and they can still make inticing and meandering prog whilst keeping close to the a fairly stoic verse chorus structure. Excellent job boys!
B0000BWVCJ|5.0|The x-men 2 movie was a real surprise. I didnt expect it to be as good as it was. I am no comic fanatic. I saw the first x-men movie and thought it was a c+ movie, spider-man was a b-, dardevel was a c, and the hulk was a d+. This movie was one of the best action movies this year. In fact, it might be one of the best action movies I have ever seen. The major reason I enjoyed this movie is because of the story line. It isnt the normal \\"theres a bad guy loose and the super hero kills him and the world it a safer place again,( while getting the girl).\\" This movie is more of a anti super hero movie. It is much darker then most comic book movies but still maintains a comedic sence. The super heros in the movie are anti super heros because everyone who they save hates them, and it is on a bigger scale then spider-man. Anouther thing about this movie is the fact that their are a team of x-men instead of one or two super heros agenst one or two super villins. another plus is the fact that the story is based around a probelm that can never be solved. The probelm is the growing fear of the mutant kind on earth. Every year more and more mutants are born, and every year there are more people to hate them. Even families are separated by this as shown when the iceman reterns home after his school was invaded by government officals. After showing his family his mutation, his brother calls the police in jealousy, and states that his family is under attack by mutants. This complex storyline of prejudice and hatred twords mutants is a giant opening for a third instalment, and hopfully it is just as good as this one.
B000006YMM|5.0|Agnetha's producer on this album is Eric Stewart, who had previously been a member of the Mindbenders in the sixties and 10cc in the seventies. He wrote two songs (I won't be leaving you, Save me why don't you) and co-wrote another (I won't let you go) with Agnetha. The album also includes songs by Jeff Lynne (One way love) and Justin Hayward (The angels cry, with Justin playing guitars on the track). There is an eighties feel to the album but the synthesizers never take over (though they come close to doing so occasionally, notably on Click track) - the focus is always on Agnetha's outstanding voice. Of course, this makes it impossible to listen to the album without hearing echoes of Abba and that may be a distraction to some people.<br /><br />Whereas Agnetha's previous solo album (Wrap your arms around me) had yielded three minor UK hits, no singles from this album made the UK charts although I assume that some did in other European countries. Nevertheless, there are many excellent tracks here, especially the first five (One way love, Eyes of a woman, Just one heart, I won't let you go, The angels cry) and the last two (I keep turning off lights, We move as one).<br /><br />This album is unlikely to appeal to anybody who doesn't like Abba, so don't worry about this until you've got a significant collection of Abba music. If you enjoy Abba's music enough to be interested in exploring further, you might enjoy this album although not all Abba fans love this album as much as I do.
B000002AH7|5.0|I have loved this album since it first came out.  Miles Davis best.
B00005JMEW|3.0|Say there is a question, how much blood is too much blood. The answer is \\"when you feel sick\\". That's what happened to me to certain degree when I was watching this movie. Actually, I like action, crime, violence movies (some movie databases recommend me this movie with my past reviews). I have watched many violent movies with brutal murders and all. But this one was above all of them.          First, gist of the movie, Uma Thurman, who is pregnant, is beaten brutally and shot in the head by a group of people, somehow she survives. She recovers in the hospital to some degree, escapes from there. Now she is on rampage to take revenge. She gets Samurai training from a veteran of Japan as well. She kills few people and as Bill is the main villain, I guess he will be killed in part 2.    Every fighting sequence is very bloody and sickening. Blood, slaughter,  body parts, deaths are ample. The fountain of the blood used several times (once in animation as well).    The things I liked, cinematography, presentation, story pace, costumes, grip over audience and interesting chronological events jumble.   To summarize, if you like action and ready for high dose of violence, you will enjoy this movie.    The things I didn't like about the movie are, acute violence, mismatch of the action scenes with the characters and story (that's what I felt when I compared them, you can try that too, provided your mind allows you to think about the movie), very generic story, un-human stunts, scenes.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|8 songs but only 4 good ones.  DT needs to return to \\"Scenes\\" and build of that amazing album.  Best track Walk beside You.  Buy any Enchant album over this.  If you haven't heard Enchant check their website theoasis.cc
B0000C9V3T|5.0|IRONSIDE IS THE GREATEST SONG IVE EVER HEARD. THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER. QUENTIN TARRANTINO IS MY FATHER. I LOVE UMA!!!and myself.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|I'm sure this has been said, but needs to be said often.  Copy Protection Sucks.  Fortunately, this uses the really crappy Suncomm copy protection.  To rip this CD, hold the shift key while inserting the CD.  If you've already had this disk in your drive, reboot the computer, and reinsert the CD with the shift key down.  iTunes imported this into the library just fine.
B00082IJ08|4.0|As you can tell from my reviewer page, the Gorillaz debut CD is one of my favorites ever and with good reason. It's just a brilliant CD. And when I found out they were coming out with a new one, I had to hear it. Now, when I first heard Feel Good Inc., I loved the song. And I downloaded the rest of it, and I thought \\"This album sucks!\\"    However, I kept giving it another shot for the couple of songs I did like, and for the fact that I didn't exactly fall in love with the s/t at first either. And I was surprised, as I began to enjoy the songs more and more. And now that I've gotten a feel, I must say this is a good CD. I still don't feel it measures up to their self-titled first CD, but is still quite good.     This has a bit more hip-hop influence than the last album, but however, is looking in the wrong place for it. Del tha Funky Homosapien was a huge part of the first Gorillaz CD, and had he been used in place of the other rappers on this CD, it would probably have been an improvement. It also would've benefitted from having De La Soul, who did the best rap performance on the CD, do the rest of the rap songs. It still does have it's contributions from the Blur (Damon Albarn/2-D) and Cibo Matto (Miho Hattori/Noodle) parts of the band.    My song by song review:    1. Intro - Just an intro. Kind of pointless, but it serves its purpose... N/A  2. Last Living Souls - An interesting song with an interesting beat that towards the middle of the song has a surprising piano part. Though this was one of my first favorite, now it seems like one of the weaker songs on the CD. 7.5/10  3. Kids With Guns - One of my favorite songs. The beat to this song is just hypnotizing, and combined with one of the best choruses for any of the Gorillaz song and a dramatic ending, this is one of the album's highlights. 9/10  4. O Green World - One of the stranger songs and the first rap-dominated song of the CD. The song is good and has an interesting rap input. 7/10  5. Dirty Harry - Thissong I'm kind of half-and-half on. The beat and singing is good, but the rapping towards the end of the song kind of ruins it. Still a decent song. 6.5/10  6. Feel Good Inc. - The first single and by far the best song on the CD. Has an excellent bass part and the vocals done by 2-D/Damon Albarn fits perfectly, with excellent acoustic guitar at the chorus by Noodle/Miho Hattori. The guys of De La Soul have a cameo and gives it a feel similar to Clint Eastwood, with a balance of singing and rapping. They give one of the better rap contributions on the CD. Overall just an amazing song. 10/10  7. El Manana - Don't be fooled, this has nothing in common with Latin Simone, as it's not in Spanish. Nonetheless, still a good song that's more similar to Sound Check (Gravity) on their first album. A more rock-oriented song on the CD with excellent vocals. 8/10  8. Every Planet We Reach Is Dead - Very catchy sound starting out this song. Just a good song overall. 7.5/10  9. November Has Come - Originally, I ripped this track a new one in my review. However, listening to it again I like it a little more. However, this doesn't save it from being below the rest of the album, but however it's not bad. The bland rap at the beginning and lack of beat is somewhat poor, but Damon's part does it better. While I raise the score from what I had before, still one of the worse songs by the band. 5/10  10. All Alone - The most rap-dominated song, but not a bad one. Has an awesome intro to the song and the rapping on this song isn't bad. 7/10  11. White Light - A lot of people say this song is just poor filler, but I disagree. An excellent little ditty that I would call the 'Punk' of Demon Days, a short little song that still manages to be awesome. The guitar riff on this song is simply amazing. At 2:08 it's the shortest real song on the CD, but one of the best. 9/10  12. DARE - This song sounds like a mid-90s pop song. But is that a bad thing? No. This song is catchy and fun to listen to, andhas one of the best cameos on the CD. 8.5/10  13. Fire Coming Out of a Monkey's Head - One of the fan-favorites on the CD, this song has it all. An interesting intro to the song is mixed with narrative that mixes well with the background music. It switches to excellent acoustic guitar and vocals by 2-D/Damon twice in the song. Always fun to listen to. The last great song of the CD... 9.5/10  14. Don't Get Lost In Heaven - Now, I mentioned in November Has Come that I only disliked three songs on the album. DGLIH and Demon Days are basically one big track cut into two. And I'm sorry, but they just sound like gospel mixed by Gorillaz with 2-D's vocals. Neither of the songs are very good and are down the worst Gorillaz efforts yet, and definitley a poor way to end such a good album. 1.5/10  15. Demon Days - See Don't Get Lost in Heaven    Overall, this is a solid and excellent album in the case of all but the last two tracks. But nonetheless, this CD is definitley worth picking up. While it doesn't measure up to the first CD, it still has the Gorillaz charm in many of the songs and is overall a solid and worthwhile album.
B0009P42S2|1.0|What a steaming pile this was. I had the unfortunate opportunity to see this film in the theater and took it.  Katsuhiro Otomo has a fantastic reputation as an illustrator, author, and director.  However, this does not excuse him from the prolonged banality that is called STEAMBOY. Though there is stunning animation, that is no excuse for the shallow character development and weak plot that permeates this film.  Moreover, rampant explosions and wanton violence at the end (sorry for the spoiler, but AKIRA fans will know what I'm talking about) were not enough to erase the placid nothingness that forced this viewer to try and keep from nodding off for almost two hours.  I must make a point that I am a big fan of Otomo's comics and the film version of Akira.  Visually it lives up to his artistic reputation. Falling short doesn't even come close to describing how deep in the hole the rest of this movie has descended.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is Linkin Park's second album after Hybrid Theory (unless you count Reanimation, which I DON'T). Their new stuff is a lot heavier and darker, with most lyrics being about betrayal, loss, and making wrong choices. This CD also contains a colored booklet with some cool art, lyrics, and info on the songs. And If you put it in your computer, you can see \\"The Art of Meteora\\", an interesting documentry on Meteora's art work, and the music video of \\"Somewhere I Belong\\".  <br />Here are the songs you can expect to hear on the album: <br /> <br />Intro: Totally unnecessary. Just the sound of rain, and a glass bottle shattering. Did not need to be a seperate track. 0/10 <br /> <br />Don't Stay: A very hard and fast pace song along the lines of One Step Closer. The guitar work by Brad Delson is very impressive and the DJ scratching is cool. The vocals are very good as well. My only complaint is this song's close similarity to One Step Closer. 9/10 <br /> <br />Somewhere I Belong: A soft song along the lines of In the End. The riff used in the verses is an acoustic guitar effected and played backwards. However, I think the rest of this song is kinda dull. The bridge is pretty cool, but the chorus just gets annoying. I don't like the video very much either. 6/10 <br /> <br />Lying From You: Another hard and anger driven song. The verses use what I think is an organ. This song is pretty good, but gets old fast. The bridge would have been bad if it hadn't been for the heavy guitar work that accompanies Mike's rap of \\"This is isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said would have you running from me, like this\\" over and over again. 7/10 <br /> <br />Hit the Floor: Wow, Linkin Park's darkest song yet. The grind riff in the backround is eerie and cool accompanied by a variety of precussion. The chorus has some of the best screaming that Chester does on the album. The only thing I don't like is Mike's 'whispering' in the bridge, I feel that Linkin Park could have done something more original. Other than that, this song is awsome! 9/10 <br /> <br />Easier to Run: Ugh, my least favorite song on the album. Sounds a lot like 'Runaway'. The verses are very soft and the bridge is very unoriginal and doesn't sport any creativity. The bearable thing about this song is the chorus, where Chester's voice blends perfectly with the guitars. 4/10 <br /> <br />Faint: Alright! This is my favorite song on the album! This is probably the fastest song on the album. The verses use cool violins and the chorus sports an awsome guitar riff. I like how the 2nd chorus keeps a kinda 'heroic' theme and then breaks into the bridge's dark tone with Chester's screams. The outro where Chester harmonizes with himself is just awesome! I can't get this song out of my head! Best song on the album! 10/10 <br /> <br />Figure.09: A great follow-up to Faint. A pretty heavy song with a cool intro riff and a great chorus. The bridge is also very cool, with Chester screaming between Mike's raps. However, Mike's rapping in the verses sounds a bit dull next to the heavy guitar chords being played in the backround. 9/10 <br /> <br />Breaking the Habit: A nice eerie song that uses a lot of effects and other instruments. Chester voice in the verses is quite eerie and melodic. I only wish that the bridge and the chorus sounded a bit heavier, they could have added some guitar work to it. 7/10 <br /> <br />From the Inside: A very cool soft song. The chourses are very climatic and sad. The bridge is anger-driven and has some pretty cool screaming and cool guitar riffs. The end of this song has one of the most climatic endings in the album. The only thing I don't like is the line in the verse: \\"Heavy thoughts shifting through dust, and the lies\\" that sounds plain wierd when Chester says it. 8/10 <br /> <br />Nobody's Listening: A hip-hop song that uses a Japanese flute sample for the entire song. It may sound wierd to some, but I think it's just brilliant how Linkin Park comes up with these things. The chorus uses a bit of bass guitar, but there are NO guitars used in this song. But I don't really like the bridge that has Mike rapping more repetitive verses. 8/10 <br /> <br />Session: Ummmm........don't really listen to this, I just skip it. Just a boring instrumetal with digitalized beats and effects.  <br /> <br />Numb: A great ending to the album, although it's quite similar to Crawling in regards to the intro and outro riff and the outro chorus. I like the saddness and solemnity of the verses and the sound of despair in the choruses and the bridge. I love how Chester sings \\"I've, become so numb, I can't feel you there, tired of being what you want me to be\\" in the outro, it's just heart-wrentching. 9/10 <br /> <br />In all, i think that this is a great Linkin Park album and should not be missed by Linkin Park and metal fans.
0385472951|4.0|I recently found this book on my brother's bookshelf at home.  It had been a while since I had read anything for pleasure but I was going on a long vacation and decided I would give this book a try.  I was immediately wrapped up in this book.  I loved the details in how the main character, Patrick, disappeared.  The book was easily one of my personal favorites untill about four pages from the end.  The surprise ending left me personally feeling very sorry for Patrick, a person I had admired for the whole book for his attention to detail and incredible luck.  I enjoy a surprise twist at the end of some books, but I just feel that this one ruined the novel a bit for me.<br /><br />I would still recommend this book to anyone as I would still refer to it as one of my personal favorite books.
0790733226|5.0|Plenty of reviews below talk about the plot details, etc, so I will omit that here.<br /><br />What I like best about this film is that it addresses both sides of the Science versus Religion debate, and is equally respectful of both sides.  Jodie Foster's character is a woman of Science, not of God.  But by the story's end she has found her own kind of Faith, though it comes partially because she is unable to provide proof of something that her doubters know darn well does actually exist.<br /><br />My only beef with the film is a minor one but it stuck out like a sore thumb to me:  Late in the film's first act she is explaining what Prime Numbers are to some government men.  She says that prime numbers are \\"numbers that are only divisible by themselves and One.\\"  Thanks for the math lesson, dear screenwriters, but in truth Prime Numbers are only EVENLY divisible by themselves and One.  Yes, there is a difference.  That little error in semantics wasn't the issue for me, however.  The issue is that just a few years before \\"Contact\\" was made, Jodie Foster directed and starred in \\"Little Man Tate\\", a film about a young boy with above-average intelligence.  In a science and math contest, the young boy and some other bright kids are asked \\"Which of these numbers are divisible by [some integer, like 3]?\\"  While the other kids think it out, Little Man Tate shouts out \\"All of them\\", which was technically correct.  The contest moderators were looking for the numbers EVENLY divisible by the integer, but they failed to make that distinction.  Tate caught the mistake and put the quizmasters to shame.  Jodie Foster, having directed that scene, SURELY should have remembered that distinction when delivering her lines in \\"Contact\\".  That Prime Numbers description goof should never have made it past the rehearsal stage.<br /><br />Funny the little things you pick up on, eh?<br /><br />\\"Contact\\" is a great movie by the way, Angela Bassett's over-emoting notwithstanding..
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is quite literally one of the best musicals ever! The soundtrack has heartstopping tracks such as \\"defying gravity\\" and tracks that just make you want to laugh, like \\"popular.\\" If they made this show into a movie, like rent, it would be a HUGE hit and i hope i dont have to wait 10 years for that!
068987474X|5.0|After reading only a couple chapters of this book I already knew I needed to up my standards and stop settling. I mean, if a man isn't interested or all about games then you know the deal. Actions speak louder than words. I saw the author of this book on Oprah and everything he said makes sense so I had to get the book. He told different women in the audience the straight up truth and they had such long stories. Some were drawn to tears. The title automatically makes you giggle. You know there aren't any more excuses. Good from a guys perspective....makes you trust your gut instinct as a woman.  <br /> <br />Never again will you keep calling a man who can't return the gesture.  <br />Never again will you have to sit in a relationship with a man for 3 years and wonder if you'll be his wife.   <br />

0441172717|2.0|As an avid fan of the fantasy/sci-fi genre, I had often been told about the sheer brilliance of Frank Herbert's classic novel \\"Dune.\\"  I finally read it, and was surprised by how much of a let-down it was.  While I can understand why it was so popular THEN, when the genre was new, it doesn't quite have the appeal NOW.  The biblical/religious allegory in it was incredibly obvious, the writing was unbearably slow, and there were things that didn't quite work out in a satisfactory way.  Throughout the whole book, the main character keeps harping on this \\"terrible purpose\\" he has, this thing that he's dreading, but NOTHING ever comes of it!  It's this tension that keeps building up but never comes to fruition, and that always really annoys me. <br /> <br />I didn't like the little blurbs from the books written by the princess, either.  They didn't serve any real purpose, other than to introduce a character we really never see.  They had nothing to do with the plot. <br /> <br />On the good side, I did like the way Herbert defined his characters so well --- with the exception of our main hero with his undefined \\"terrible purpose\\".  Most of the characters were well thought-out and believable.  As is typical in real life, the characters were not just black-and-white, pure evil and pure good.  Good characters made bad decisions and faced rock-and-hard-place choices.  And bad characters had noble characteristics and even had noble --- if often misguided --- intentions which fired their eventual actions. <br /> <br />In spite of its interesting aspects, however, I am still surprised that Dune can still hold its own against the superior science-fiction we can now pick up on our bookstore shelves.
020530902X|5.0|The joker who snidely gave _Elements_ one star spurred me to write this review.<br /><br />I edited magazines for seven years and found this book immensely useful. Read it early in your life to lay a strong foundation, and refresh yourself with it every few years to hone your skills.
0743455967|4.0|Since this is the first, and only, Stephen King book I've read, it is my first exposure to his written work. I chose \\"On Writing\\" to see what a commercially successful writer does, and what he recommends writers do.     You will learn enough of King's background to see why he may have developed the style and traits he employs as a writer. He delves into many specifics that you can immediately adapt to your writing: pet peeves, favorite books, grammar, punctuation; all of these are given attention in no specific order, but are covered when the author feels they are relevant.    Though \\"On Writing\\" is far from an instructional manual or tutorial guide, there is an exercise that Mr. King proposes to readers, and I must say that completing it will help you to grow as a writer, regardless of your level. This goes for published authors also.    All in all, \\"On Writing\\" is a book that all writer's will enjoy and benefit from. Immediately after reading it, I picked up \\"Gun Slinger,\\" and after reading 5 or 6 pages, I found myself bored and unimpressed with the writing. I noticed several passages that seemed to directly conflict with what King wrote in \\"On Writing.\\" \\"Gun Slinger\\" appeared to me to have been written by someone else. It was amatuerish in comparison.     I intend to read Stephen King's novels, because I very much enjoyed his writing style in \\"On Writing,\\" but I will probably never pick up \\"Gun Slinger\\" again.
B00005U122|5.0|I bought this album based on the strength of reviews here.  I'm glad I did. <br /> <br />I'm more of a David Gilmour fan than Roger Waters.  I love David's stuff, and his live DVD is great.  I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this DVD as much as I did.  Roger's take on the older songs was great, his solo material was fantastic, and the band was spectacular. <br /> <br />If you are a Pink Floyd fan (even one that tends to like David Gilmour stuff better than Waters), you'll want to check this DVD out.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I think this CD is great. I have an electic taste in music and I first came to know who John Mayer is through a Dave Chappelle skit on his DVD. I just thought he only played the guitar and was a little soulful. He has a very nice voice that's not irritating. Like effortless vocals....I play \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\", \\"Neon\\", and \\"City Love Mayer\\" all the time.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|The sets for the movie, the puppet designs are great. So what went wrong?  1. The voice dubs all sound the same, they didn't use enough actors.  2. I would feel ripped off If I spent money in the theatre, it has a low budget bad movie feel to it. 3. South Park characters rock!!  The characters in this movie are boring and you start to look at your watch hoping the torture of watching will end soon.  There are some funny explicit scenes such as exaggerated sex scenes and gratuitous violence, but not enough to make it worth while.  Don't waste your time!
B0007TKNL0|3.0|Admittedly, it's hard to have to see a film when you are so used to the stage show; one can't help comparing the two. In some ways, this film did wonderful justice to the famous stage show. In others, it could have done better.  <br /> <br />The LOOK of the film was fabulous, absolutely gorgeous beyond description. The costuming, the sets, all of it was beautiful. I was glad they kept the Andrew Lloyd Webber version of the Phantom's mask, only covering HALF the face, rather than the whole thing. But I was surprised at how non-repulsive the Phantom actually WAS. He's supposed to have these ghastly hideous features, but he really wasn't that bad, his scars were minor and not monstrous at all. It was a little anti-climactic. The Phantom himself was a little too attractive, too sexy, which was a little weird.  <br /> <br />I don't mind so much that Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford did not play in this film. However, I think that the voices they had were not as good as they could have found. The Phantom had a decent voice, but it wasn't dark like it should have been. Christine seemed to have some trouble reaching some of the higher notes, and her voice was simply too weak to be convincing as an opera singer. It was a nice voice, sweet and pretty, but unsupported, a voice that would never carry in an opera house. And while I didn't necessarily mind Minnie Driver's role as the prima donna, it didn't make any sense to have her play the part in the first place --- especially since she didn't even do her own singing. This is a popular enough show that it doesn't NEED a big name just for the sake of having a big name in the film. That almost seems to show a lack of faith in their own work, if they have to feature someone well-known to get people interested in seeing it. They should have used the person who actually did the singing voice.  <br /> <br />At least most of the music was in there. I was worried they would cut a lot of the good songs, but they kept it all in there, and most of it was pretty well-done, even if the voices COULD have been stronger.  <br /> <br />The most annoying thing for me, though, was the random flashes into the \\"present,\\" the black-and-white segments. The beginning and the end is fine, it's appropriate. But having them interspersed through the rest of the film was really distracting, and unnecessary. It brought the audience out of the real action of the story and didn't add anything to the plot. Didn't make sense.  <br /> <br />I certainly enjoyed the film, and it had a lot of good things about it. But I think they could have done a better job than they did. The next time I see \\"The Phantom of the Opera,\\" it will be on the stage.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|I am not sure how I wound up with this CD. It just appeared unopened on my stack one day. I have never heard of the artist or the album. I decided to give it a try anyway. It was not bad but I have heard better. <br /> <br />This is a double album and consists of 2 disks. Each has a few interesting tunes and or songs. The style of all of them seems to be a mellow blend of country and rock with, perhaps, a dash of folk thrown in for good measure. The songs tend to be of the ballad variety. The voice is good and so is the band. If you like this kind of stuff, you might give it a try. <br />
0440211727|4.0|John Grisham takes readers deep inside the lives of law professionals and provides a level of vision that only someone with personal experience can. Grisham, a former, attorney proves that he is up to the challenge, steps up to the plate, and shares what appears to be personal experience at times. If it's not personal, then that shows how good this is, because it feels personal, and that's good writing. <br /> <br />Characters are developed throughout the story, slowly and completely. Mr. Grisham gives you just enough information on each character to keep you feeling as if you know the character, and then you learn more of their past; what makes them tick; little personality traits that reveal more of who they are. <br /> <br />\\"A Time To Kill\\" is John Grisham's first novel, and the only one of his that I have read. I hear he's gotten even better. Looks like I'll be busy for a while.

An awesome book !!! <br /> <br />This book introduces the metaphor's of  the `red ocean ` and the ` blue ocean'.

B00004XPPB|5.0|Well, the acting is great but the acting in the film is not what I intend to write on.  <br /> <br /> With Donnie Brasco we have one more film attempting to paint mobsters as moral and honorable.  The primary mobster in this film is named Lefty who is played by Al Pacino.  Lefty is a man who by his admission has murdered 26 men.  Despite this fact Pacino and director Mike Newell go to great length attempting to demonstrate Lefty's honorable character.  <br /> <br /> In the Special Edition DVD of this film Newell provides a commentary.  One of the things he speaks about is how the film is a tragedy because it show Donnie Brasco's moral center being corrupted by associating with the mosters he is assigned to bring down.  I believe, however, that the true tragedy is the lengths that films such as this one and many others go to attempt to portray members of organized crime who have no problems with taking human life as decent and even normal individuals.  Could that not be a tragedy worth a film of its own? <br /> <br /> To further support the fact which I am attempting to exress Newell admits or even brags on the commentary that while filming Donnie Brasco they had a mobster on staff.  Although I find this shocking I do not find it as shocking as the fact that Newell has appears to have no ethical problem with this.   <br />
B00000427L|5.0|After listening to a recording of Rachmaninoff's 2nd concerto and hearing a lot about the 3rd concerto, I jumped at buying this CD because of the low cost for two CDs - I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />For me the highlight by far is the third piano concerto, where Ashkenazy seems to pour out passion without getting carried away.  This recording I much prefer to Argerich's recording (passionate, but little restraint and thought put into that performance) and even Horowitz's (although this may be because of it's worse sound quality).  The first movement is played slower than most other performances, but is filled with passion and technical mastery.  I am starting to learn this concerto and know how difficult it is! I was glad to see that Ashkenazy used the longer, chordal codenza rather than the shorter one used by Horowitz and Argerich (those are the only other recordings I've heard) with I much prefer. <br /> <br />The first and fourth concertos are also fabulously played but for me they don't compare to the third.  The second concerto, however, was a little bit of a disappointment for me (not enough for me to give the discs 4 stars, however).  Because I have already learned this concerto, I'm probably quicker to find faults with Ashkenazy's playing here.  If I could put my finger on what I don't like about it it would be the balance between the piano and orchestra - you can hardly hear the piano at some of the most difficult sections.  Still, the orchestra sounds beautiful and so does the piano when you can hear it.   <br /> <br />Since listening to this disc Ashkenazy has quickly become one of my favorite pianists - as has Levine as a conductor.  I would heartily recommend this CD for anyone, but especially for anyone who ever aspires to play any of these pieces - all four of the are beautiful and these performances are well thought-out and powerful.

0790729652|4.0|I hadn't seen the original Batman movie since it was released in 1989, and I have to say that it is not quite as good as I remember it being the first time.  Sixteen years later, I'm still trying to figure out how Michael Keaton got the Batman gig.  He was actually pretty good in the movie, but it just doesn't really feel like Batman when Keaton is behind the cowl (nor does Keaton really exude the proper Bruce Wayne aura).  When you get right down to it, Jack Nicholson pretty much carries this film on his shoulders, as it doesn't have the greatest of plots, the whole modern remaking of the Batman mystique results in several drawn-out, somewhat boring scenes, and there really isn't all that much action.  And who decided that Batman has to have romantic relationships all the time now?  The real Batman certainly doesn't have a sleepover on a first date.  The whole Vicky Vale storyline just didn't work for me in this film, largely because Keaton doesn't effectively sell the whole Batman vs Bruce Wayne conflict that lies within him.<br /><br />This film basically introduces Batman to his fellow Gothamites.  Gotham City is a veritable cesspool of crime and corruption, and I can't imagine how Commissioner Gordon kept his job with all of the organized crime operating throughout the city.  It takes Batman a little while to find his niche as a crime-fighter.  Once people actually start believing the wild stories about a dude in a bat suit, they question whether or not he is good or bad.  The Joker helps resolve that little dilemma, as he doesn't really hide his definite bad-ness under a bushel.  Of course, The Joker wasn't always the Joker, and this movie gives us one version of The Joker's origins.  Jack Napier was just a high-ranking henchman before an encounter with Batman left him, uh, changed.  Then it's green hair and Fantasy Island smiles all around.  His first big caper consists of poisoning household products with the Smilex chemical that made the Joker the Joker - not exactly a money-winning venture.  The Joker is basically all about killing people and upstaging Batman in the Gotham City headlines.  He and Batman do come across one another a couple of times in the film, but they don't really square off until the end.  The film does at least show some of the special relationship between good guy and bad guy - this is, after all, Batman's primary personal enemy.  To some degree, The Joker created Batman and Batman created the Joker (and they also seem to share the same taste in women).<br /><br />Jack Palance and Billy Dee Williams are sort of wasted in this film.  This was good news for Jack Nicholson because Palance is one of the few actors who could have held his own and taken some of the spotlight away from him.  The scene where Nicholson impersonates Palance is priceless, though.  Nicholson really gets all of the good lines here (e.g., Wait'll they get a load of me), and he pretty much lets himself go wild playing this insane character.  It's interesting that the guy playing Batman doesn't get top billing in a Batman movie, but Nicholson definitely deserved that honor for this film.  Without Nicholson, Batman would be an insufferably flat, tedious film.<br /><br />The Prince music is still kicking, Tim Burton's directorial vision retains its intriguingly dark quality, and the Joker is still lighting up the screen, but Batman just doesn't have the same punch it had when comics' most celebrated crime fighter came to the big screen in 1989.- not exactly a money-winning venture.

0385510454|4.0|What this yarn from the super-popular John Grisham lacks in suspense level, it makes up for in narrative adventure.  As an Italy-phile, a huge attraction for me is in its setting of that country and a central figure who is tasked with learning Italian, the country's culture, an Italian city's streets and customs --activities to which I can well relate. <br /> <br />The effort of the scenario is to convince the reader that what the CIA does with The Broker makes any sense.  They're training him to be adaptive to his circumstances when their objective is to keep him a defenseless target. <br /> <br />In an author's note, Grisham admits, \\"I know very little about spies, electronic surveillance, satellite phones, smartphones, bugs, wires, mikes, and the people who use them.  If something in this novel approaches accuracy, it's probably a mistake.\\"  All right.  But, for my money, his travelogue takes us to one of the richest and most historically colorful countries on the planet for some thrills, and when Grisham does that, I'm along for the ride. <br /> <br />For my complete review of this book and others, please visit my book review site at [...]
B000002GQK|5.0|Although in terms of chart positions and perhaps reviews this was possibly the least celebrated of the Moodies' classic seven albums (1967-72), it is my personal favourite. When I began turning my vinyl collection to CDs, this was the first Moodies album I purchased. It is very coherent - unlike some of its predecessors and its successor. It is a melancholy set, by and large, but it does end on a note of - I think - guarded optimism. <br />From the opening of \\"Procession\\", there is a great deal of tension present here - and a lot of aural experimentation. Many different textures rise and fall in this piece that purports to describe humankind's journey through time. It gathers a great deal of force before exploding into one of Justin Hayward's finest rockers, \\"The Story in Your Eyes\\", which includes dense harmonies, sinuous guitars and a stomping piece of piano work - just a hint of older Moodies - from Mike Pinder before the massive energy generated in this song ebbs away to Ray Thomas' excellent \\"Our Guessing Game\\" - an openly pessimistic musing on the human condition wrapped up as a gentle ballad with a great sing-along chorus and fine double-tracked guitar solo from Hayward. <br />The increasingly nihilistic tone is suddenly lifted by the gorgeous \\"Emily's Song\\". I don't generally like John Lodge's work as much as those of the other Moodies, but his contributions to this album are superb. \\"Emily's Song\\" is a lullaby, a sweet moment of peace and innocence amid the mingled woe/sturm und drang of the rest of the set. <br />\\"After You Came\\" is a superb track, a real rock song with the Moodies sharing vocals (all four singers have distinct voices that are enjoyable to listen to) and some searching Graeme Edge lyrics that tell us to \\"Come back to Earth/for what it's worth/where you've been dreaming of a ceiling/not a hole\\". <br />\\"One More Time to Live\\" is my favourite John Lodge composition - it too bears a weight of introspective despair and seems to poised at the edge of surrender to the horrible weight of human history, viz: \\"One more time to live/and I have made it mine/Turn the Earth to sand/and still commit no crime/He who wants to fight/Begins the end of time/But I have wishes more than these...\\" <br />Again, the doom and gloom is lifted by a childlike touch, Ray Thomas' nursery-rhymish \\"Nice to be Here\\", about the beauty of nature and the power of imagination. It's also a very catchy song in its own right. <br />\\"You Can Never Go Home\\" is a Hayward ballad with lovely lyrics and an uplifting chorus that leads nicely into one of the finest songs the Moodies ever committed to tape: Mike Pinder's \\"My Song\\". This is an epic, symphonic piece that finishes the album with a sense of stolid endurance in the face of despair - I am reminded of the sense of spiritual sterility and purposive striving that animated TS Eliot's \\"Ash-Wednesday\\". The song begins somberly and delicately before massed Mellotron waves destroy the elegaic opening and then collapse, themselves, into emptiness. Ragged breathing, electronic hisses and one thin, beautiful melody at the edge of hearing. This melody gathers force, building and building before there is an outraged burst of guitar, drums and vocal harmonies that spiral through several keys and then fall sighingly into a restatement of the opening theme. The song ends with Pinder avowing: \\"I'm going to sing my song/A song that never ends\\" - an ironic touch as these lyrics appear as the song is fading away...pure genius. <br />The whole set plays like a Mahler symphony, warm romanticism, sentimentality, jagged, angular constructions of rage and despair and a floating lyricism that drives and melds the whole. And yes, its good to sing along with.
B000001ELF|4.0|Never before have the members of a supergroup remained together and put out solo projects, under the band's name, at the same time. Well, never before has there been a band like Kiss, and most certainly, there never will be; so they decided to do it.  <br /> <br />Here is the most commercially successful of the four paint-faced rocker's individual releases. <br /> <br />Ace Frehley, Kiss's lead guitarist, proves himself an extremely capable front man on this classic rock 'n' roll masterpiece of an album. The Spaceman stays where he should be and plays to his strengths, vocally and musically, and the results are a thoroughly entertaining listen that is worthy of multiple replays. <br /> <br /> Very few artists can remake a song and do it better then the original version to the point where the song is now identified with them rather then the original artist. New York Groove, the album's only remake, is a number that does just that. This song is unquestionably Ace's now, and provided him with the only song from any of the Kiss solo albums to hit on the radio charts. <br /> <br />The album starts out strong, continues through, and ends with the excellent mellow instrumental, \\"Fractured Mirror.\\" Ace would continue his Fractured theme on his solo projects later in his career.

B0007CNXUK|1.0|[...]  Here is some honest advice. If you really need to see this movie, by all means, don't rent it or buy it. You will only be adding dishonest dollars to the producers of this movie. Find someone who already has the movie and see it. You will understand why the rest of the movie goers have given this horrid movie a thumbs down. If you really need to know what this movie is about without wasting your money and time, just read the synopsis of this movie on this website. Just don't believe the overblown reviews.
B00005JNJT|2.0|I cannot believe this. How in the world can a movie this bad get so many good reviews? This is deffinitely the worst translation of Batman ever. This story turns Bruce Wayne into a stupid rich kid who seems to care only for himself. Not only this but at the beginning of the film Bruce is in a prison. Why in the world would Batman be a criminal. To make matters worse we find out that it is a villian who actually is responsible for creating Batman. Then they make Gordon into a cop who seems to be afraid of his own shadow. And please tell me how someone as young as Katie Holmes ends up a district attorney. None of this makes sense at all. I won't even talk about the army tank they try to pass off as the batmobile. The only reason this movie gets a two star rating is because of the way they showed the fear of Batman and because of the great preformance by the actor who played the Scarecrow. All in all if you want to see good Batman I suggest you buy the stellar animated series which is now on dvd.

B0002UOK04|5.0|Usually my reviews are somewhat detailed, but I'll make this one short and sweet. <br /> <br />Wintersun is one of the most amazing and melodic bands I have ever heard. After one listen to \\"Sleeping Stars\\" I had to pick my jaw up off the floor. Like a reviewer below me stated, Wintersun is an artful blend of many different metal genres: Power metal and melodic death being the prominent ones, but the symphonic aspect is reminiscient of many symphonic black metal acts such as Dimmu Borgir.  <br /> <br />This is metal, of course: The Children of Bodom-like vocals prove that much. But it's probably the \\"prettiest\\" metal I've ever heard; It's that melodic, it's that good. The lyrics are also of a deep and meaningful nature. <br /> <br />This album is not just for \\"metal\\" fans, it's also for MUSIC fans. Don't let the vocals scare you off. If you listen to the actual music, I think you'll find yourself amazed at how little people know about this band outside of Finland. <br /> <br />Wintersun makes me wonder what radio is like in Finland. If bands like this are actually considered mainstream, it must be a great place to live.

B0001XAOLQ|5.0|This film is a masterpiece because it tells the tragic story of a German submarine in 1941. That submarine is brought to fight in La Rochelle, goes to battle in the Atlantic, does some good military work, evades the counter-fight, and starts going home. But counter-orders arrive and they are sent on a suicide mission through the Gibraltar straights. They fail to cross, they sink, and they miraculously manage to re-emerge and go back to their base in La Rochelle where a surprise air-raid kills nearly everyone and destroys the submarine that sinks in the harbor. But this tragedy would not be enough if it were not vested and dressed in some human garb. And that is the main beauty of the film. The captain is rebellious and does not agree with the F&uuml;hrer but he is a German and as such he considers Germany in danger and he considers it his duty to fight to defend his motherland. The very dilemma of many soldiers in those satanic years. And the other officers and all the soldiers, particularly those young endoctrinated sub-mariners that arrive from Berlin, are described in their utter, utmost and absolute suffering, physical, moral, emotional, psychological, you name it you have it, suffering. And that probably is real courage. In the direst situations courage is for the captain to give the right orders even if it means suffering to fulfill a mission and survive, no matter what, and for the sailors to accept and obey these orders even if they do not entirely understand them nor agree with them. In such difficult situations blind obedience is needed, which gives to the humane and deeply respectful attitude of the captain in normal situations all the more value. But this film has become a masterpiece because it shows how war is immoral, always unjustified, absurd and ridiculous. This film is an anti-war film denouncing all politicians who dared and still dare to force ordinary people into absurd suffering and living conditions to attain their aim to control the world or their own peoples. What's more this film is so well done that more than three hours of images entirely locked up in a 1941 submarine are never weak, even slightly boring. The film keeps our interest awake from the very first scene of sailors pissing on the passing car of their captain on the night before taking to sea to the very last scene of the sinking of the submarine and the dying of the captain. Even mouldy bread and fresh bananas are made interesting if not fascinating by the simple comments such images carry.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUr own peoples.

B0001ZX0OW|2.0|To be honest, I had higher expectations. I haven't read the book and I cannot compare it to the screenplay. However, I thought that the film lacked in continuity, it would fall apart at times. Pacing was another thing that, in my opinion, suffered. Nothing remarkable with the cinematography either.<br /><br />Well, what came through though was undoubtedly the professionalism of the \\"all-star\\" cast (Bacon, Gay Harden, Linney). Penn delivered an incredible performance, yet sometimes he tended to overact. Robbins, who totally managed to capture his character, took my breath away with his powerful playing.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this film more to aspiring actors who could learn a-plenty from the aces of the profession.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The burial; The Bride discovering she's pregnant (flashback); the intense, heavy, short-lived confrontation between The Bride and Budd; the Bride vs Elle; \\"...but I'll try my best to be sweet\\" (The Bride's wedding rehearsal); Bill and The Bride meet again; the final confrontation: this is the list of great scenes from Quentin Tarantino's epic conclusion to the \\"Kill Bill\\" series (and I assure you there are a thousand more moments and surely a few sequences that slipped my mind). The fact that each and every sequence is filmed with the dexterity and wisdom of a great film maker only elevates the film to a higher status. To accompany each scene --in turn making them that much more memorable and unique-- are brilliant, detailed character creations/thriving performances from each lead actor. At the top of this list are Uma Thurman and David Carradine, both of which deserve Oscar nominations for their work here. In the end, Kill Bill, Volume 2 is so original within its homage, so memorable despite the connecting tissues that tend to drag, so well-acted and deepened by great actors, that to resist its culminating emotional impact becomes an impossibility. See this. You will not be sorry, but be sure to keep in mind that Volume 2 is but the second half of one whole. Together, volumes 1 and 2 make a masterpiece, fully balanced and like nothing you've ever witnessed before; it is a package of cultural and cinematic references woven together into something that will itself be referenced as its own in the future, thanks to Tarantino's amazing skill and knowledge of what makes the movies a passionate art.

B0002O7XW2|3.0|The Christine: Special Edition DVD was released in Region 4 back in April and my review is on that.  According to reports, it is identical to the Special Edition to be released in US this August. <br /> <br />I had not seen Christine since 1983, and remembered it being quite patchy and reasonably scary.  However, being a John Carpenter fan, I figured I would add it to my DVD collection (plus it was a good price).   <br /> <br />Seeing Christine again over 20 years later was interesting, but I still feel the film just loses my interest from about 3/4 into the film.  The storyline is far from Steven King's best works.  The acting is okay, but there is just something missing from this film to lift it to 'cult classic' in my opinion. <br /> <br />The Special Edition DVD transfer is acceptable for its age, not a lot of restoration has gone into it. There are many scenes which look soft and a few that are out of focus. The best news is that you get the original 2:35 widescreen ratio. <br /> <br />Features wise, three very short featurettes have been filmed especially for the DVD release.  The main one includes interviews with most of the cast, including the geek.  There are also trailers for other movies.  <br /> <br />Is it worth buying?  Only if you are a John Carpenter fan.  Otherwise my advice is to rent it first and decide if you need it.

0380973650|4.0|Neil Gaiman's AMERICAN GODS is one of the most unique experiments in novel writing I've come across in years.  Not a perfect work, certainly, but reading it made me wish more equally talented contemporaries would find the reason for taking half the chances in their work that NG does here.  A novel, after all, should be novel.  Gaiman's prose is wildly uneven, a steady gale of letters that had me thinking at the best moments of Hemingway, at the worst of Douglas Adams on a martini jag.  Unneccesarily long, and losing much of its turgid power by the end, still Gaiman shows great range throughout the piece, adapting voice and style over the eons traversed by his divine pantheon of expatriots, and it is just some of these sidebar pieces that I enjoyed the most.  Gaiman's strengths are many and easily apparent from the first pages, but it is his strong sense of story that carries us to the end here.  Fancy writing in any quantity has never compensated for absence of story, and the author of AMERICAN GODS seems to know this in ways too many otherwise more gifted novelists of our generation will just never understand.  Having said all that, the novel is a tad ungainly.  Something wrong with the balance, like a crapulent diabetic stepping up to the scales.  But don't let that deter any of you.  GODS is great, illuminating fun.  And who knows?  You just might learn something.  I sure did.
078681859X|5.0|Recently, I pre-ordered the sixth book of the Harry Potter series and was looking for a few novels to read in the meantime. I foudn what I was looking for with The Amulet of Samarkand, the first book in the Bartimaeus Trilogy. While there are resemblences off the bat to Harry Potter, it is still an excellent book and an intriguing tale of a young magician who is abandoned by his parents and sold to the government at the age of five. Nathaniel soon begins his training to become a magician under the tutelage of Arthur Underwood and his caring wife, Martha. However, things turn sour when Nathaniel is publicly humilated by a rival magician (Simon Lovelace) and there begins the plot of the story,  revenge against Lovelace at all costs. Without spoiling too much, Nathaniel implores the help of the witty djinni Bartimaeus and the tale takes a dark turn with deception, murder, and corruption at every turn. Again, there are many similarities to Harry Potter, since the setting of the book is in London. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying the book and recommending it to anyone who's looking for a great tale of magic and enjoys \\"coming of age\\" heroes.<br /><br />-Travis S.
B00005JMEW|4.0|\\"Revenge is never a straight line. It is a forest. And like a forest it is easy to lose your way, to get lost, to forget where you came in\\". This phrase, said by a secondary character, expresses quite well the essence of this film. Quite simply, \\"Kill Bill\\" is a revenge movie.<br /><br />The plot is not overly complicated, although it is somehow strange. A former assassin (played by Uma Thurman) is almost killed during a rehearsal of her wedding. It seems that her former lover and boss, Bill (David Carradine), and the members of his \\"Deadly Viper Assassination Squad\\" here holding a mean grudge. They attacked the wedding party, and viciously but cleanly shot everybody everybody dead. That is, except for \\"The Bride\\", who they hit repeatedly before Bill shot her in the head, despite the fact that she was pregnant. They left her for dead, but instead she fell in a profound comma.<br /><br />The bride woke up years later, remembering exactly what had happened, and all that she had lost. Of course, she knows exactly who is to blame for everything: Bill. And so she begins to wreck her vengeance on those who destroyed the future she wanted, with a husband and her baby. The bride will begin by killing everybody in Bill's death squad, and will ultimately reach Bill himself.<br /><br />What else is to be said about this movie?. Well, \\"Kill Bill\\" is a bit over the top sometimes, and it cannot be denied that it has lots of blood and violence. Strangely enough, that didn't make me dislike the movie, because the special effects that turned many scenes into blood-baths weren't overly realistic, and the dialogue in those scenes emphasized the fact that not everything should be taken seriously. The director, Quentin Tarantino, probably made this film as an homage to martial arts films, and added his eccentric touch to it. The excellent results are evident in \\"Kill Bill\\", for all to see.<br /><br />Lasty but not least, I would like the point out that the audio and the subtitles in this dvd are available in many languagues, including Chinese and Japanese, so if you are trying to learn them watching \\"Kill Bill\\" could be a good way of practicing  without having to make too much effort.<br /><br />On the whole, I can say that I really liked this movie. It was not the kind of film I usually watch, but I ended up enjoying it a lot. A word of advice, though... If you can, rent \\"Kill Bill\\" and \\"Kill Bill 2\\" at the same time, or you will end up running to your video store after watching the first movie, in order to watch the second one immediately :)<br /><br />Belen Alcates in this dvd are available in many languagues, including Chinese and Japanese, so if you are trying to learn them watching \\"Kill Bill\\" could be a good way of practicing  without having to make too much effort. <br /> <br />On the whole, I can say that I really liked this movie.

B000001FDI|5.0|'Blind Faith' is one of the finest albums of the 1960's, perhaps the most progressive decade in music.  That should be no surprise as the band combined elements of two of the most talented and inventive bands of the era, lead guitarist Eric Clapton and drummer Ginger Baker, two-thirds of 'Cream', together with keyboardist/lead singer Steve Winwood and bassist Rick Grech, two-fifths of 'Traffic'.  The band only managed to stick together for one album and one tour, which also shouldn't have been a surprise given that Winwood's continued indulgence in psychedelic rock and flirtations with jazz fusion were a poor match for Clapton's foray into more traditional pop sounds and life-long side-interest in blues rock.  <br /> <br />Ignoring their flimsy bonds, Clapton, Winwood, and Baker brought five stunning compositions into the studio.  For the most part, this album became a Steve Winwood dominated production, with the artist penning fully half of the songs and singing all of the lead vocals, even on Clapton's only entry, his epic 'Presence of the Lord'.  Although the set does allow all of the musicians ample room to move, Winwood's characteristic sound, together with Baker's avant garde, jazz influenced contribution ('Do What You Like'), is what gives the disc its overall feel.  The bands cover of Buddy Holly's 'Well All Right' along with Clapton's 'Presence...' are clearly the odd tracks out. <br /> <br />That being said, there is not a bad performance on this disc.  All of Winwood's contributions are classics, from the plaintive 'Had To Cry Today', to the tender 1960s's \\"looking for myself\\" nostalgia of 'Can't Find My Way Home', to the rapturous 'Sea of Joy'.  Each feature distinctive melodies, endearing lyrics, and elite musicianship.  The studio rendition of Clapton's 'Presence of the Lord' probably isn't the definitive version to most people, as numerous live covers have appeared on other releases, in particular with Eric masquerading as 'Derek and the Dominos'.  The song evolved and eclipsed its original form.  And despite the relative simplicity of 'Well All Right', this band certainly manages to make this song sound like anything but a boppin' 1950's Buddy Holly track.  If this was the first song you heard off this album and were told it was the weakest track, you'd surely buy the album without even asking to hear the rest of it. <br /> <br />The album closes with Ginger Baker literally laying claim to his fifteen minutes of fame, penning the 15 minute-plus 'Do What You Like', another period piece that gave all four musicians an opportunity to solo and, in the end, do what they like.  It's probably the most critiqued song in the lot, but a lot of the criticsm comes from people who were expecting too much.  'Blind Faith' is solid, forceful, meaningful, and possesses a personality all its own, and plenty of other 'supergroups' have produced far less.  This is a \\"must-own\\" for any collector of rock classics.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Just one listen to this masterpiece and you will instantly recognise what a leap forward it is from Zooropa it is. Where Zooropa was derivative and bombastic this is a infintely detailed and breathtakingly vast in its myriad textures.  <br /> <br />It is a monumental testament to the talents of one of the best bands of the 90's.Dont get me wrong, Zooropa is a very, very good album but it just doesn't strike out for its own territory like this does. Pop is an incomparable achievment in modern music. It is a torturous listen at times and sometimes leaves you feeling a certain chill in the heart of your very existence but this is just another level at which the album works. <br /> <br />It instills a sense of emptiness in you which reverberates the very concept of the album; that of the overbearing dependence of society in technology and computers in turn reducing human contact and communication into automatic and heartless functions.  <br /> <br />Everyone has a different standpoint though, and mine is that this is my favourite album of all time. Not what I think is the best of all time, but the album which I hold closest to my heart and soul. This is because I was able to really identify with it, and it was my first taste of really, really good music. <br /> <br />There was a streak of about a couple of months where almost every night I would go to sleep listening to the album on my discman. When I was tired of hearing one song, I'd just go to another and they all equally impressed me once I learned to see the album for what it was worth: a beautiful collection of songs based on alienation of society and personal woes. It is a very personal album, and the lyrics are mysterious and can be applied to many ideas and concepts. <br /> <br />It is depressing, but it is also delicate and lovely. Peaceful, yet chaotic. It's hard to even describe, because it offers something different for everyone. It is a journey through the mountains and valleys of the human soul, that leaves you stunned in the end.  <br /> <br />Songs with unusual structures as Please or If You Wear That Velvet Dress, explosive loud numbers as Mofo or Discotheque, euphoric melodies as Gone or Do You Feel Loved, scary moments as Wake Up Dead Man, unexpected sounds as Miami, and brilliant compositions as Staring At The Sun.  <br />I've owned my copy since 1997, and it still amazes me today.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009QBLA8|5.0|Well, you see what happened was I met a new friend on-line and he noticed that I review things. His name is The Curmudgeon and I guess he is big over-seas. I think. Anyways, he reccommended a few things for me to review. I sent a member of my web-site team up to Video One to get the DVD and a pizza for me. I'm waiting right now. To use my time efficiently, I'm going to write another review somewhere else while I wait. I'll see you over at the Conan section of Amazon.com.  <br /> <br />Okay, I'm back and so is the movie. Er.....movieS I guess....Alright, there's a small problem. He wasn't sure which movie to get.....Says there were 2 different ones he was looking at. Uh-oh. The first one is pretty non-descript, and the other one is an Arnold Shwartsaneger movie. I have no way to get ahold of The Curmudgeon right now. The names ARE kind of similar...I guess it would be easy to confuse them.....Hmmm. I have an idea. Sounds like it's time for the first ever.....DUAL-REVIEW! The Arnold one is on DVD so I'm having these guys play it on a lap-top computer. Sadly enough, he says the other one was only available on Video-Tape. I'll put that one on the V.C.R. they have.  <br /> <br />Okay, computer on the left, TV (with V.C.R.) on the right. Alright, they're still setting up the DVD on the lap-top, so I started the V.C.R.......So far, so good. A monster-worm just flew out of a guy's mouth. I'm game.....Hmmmm....Black and White. Wonder if it will change to color like the movie with the girl, and the dog, and the lion, and the wizard, and.....Okay, the DVD is starting on my LEFT side...Ok, well THAT one is in color so it makes up for the RIGHT side's lack of color............Okay, a few minutes have passed. The LEFT side has some mild action stuff....the RIGHT side though, is pretty interesting. The main guy in it is walking out-side and WHOOPS! His foot goes right in a mud-puddle. Kind of reminds me of the Three Stooges by the way it looks. But without any hitting.  <br /> <br/>Okay....after a while a LOT of action happened on the LEFT, with a really big gun. It's really hard to stop watching. But my eyes are drawn to the RIGHT side now. The guy is at a house and no one is talking to him and he seems uncomfortable. I can totally relate to this. I feel like that sometimes. The old lady looks dead. Wow, the dad at the table seems dangerously enthusiastic. Nobody really talks much and it's akward. Kind of like dinner at my place LOL. The LEFT side is in a boring part. The plot seems IMPOSSIBLE to follow. You know, it's kind of weird. I'm watching the RIGHT side more than the action-move on the LEFT! Okay, WOW! Look what's for dinner at the weird house. AMAZING. Let me watch for a few minutes.  <br /> <br />Okay, wow! How do I catch you guys up? Ummm, the LEFT side had a really crazy scene where Arnold is in a gunfight on an airplane and he jumps out and catches a parachute! And the plot is completely lost on me now. But the RIGHT side has blown my mind. There is a mutant-alien thing. But it doesn't look like either a puppet or a muppet. It looks...real. This is crazy. Give me a little while....  <br /> <br />Now the LEFT side has alligators! And another wild shoot-out, and EVERYTHING! The RIGHT side is a cloud-nightmare on earth. There is weird little worms and a chipmunk lady that sings, and the alien is out of control and just SCREAMING. I feel like this guy sometimes when I'm around the house with Morris (my dog) and I try to leave and he goes crazy and barks and barks until I come back. Okay, the LEFT side of the movie is...well, I guess you could call it \\"pure-action\\". If there really is a plot now, it does'nt matter. Arnold has a really big action-gun now. For all I know this is a Terminator sequel. Or prequel. Maybe. HOLY CRAP! On the RIGHT side, the guy that reminds me of me (I think his name might even be the same as mine) has completely been engulfed by his Cloud-Nightmare! He fought the alien, and if I tried to expain what happened next you wouldn't belive me. Some bratty little kid just stole his head and sold it to a pencil-factory. SEE! You don't believe me! I'm not even sure I believe it. WHAT!? I'm being bombarded by both movies at the SAME TIME!! I look to the LEFT, I see a HUGE gunfight with a HUGE gun in a boat-yard! I look RIGHT and I'm absolutely terrified by the chipmunk lady on the screen! Don't touch her! No! AAAAAAAA! Wow... the credits are playing now (RIGHT side only) with some herky-jerky organ music. It compiments the action on the LEFT side, strangely enough. Okay, LEFT side is done with action and almost over. Okay, it's over. That was incredibly rare.  <br /> <br />Jeez, you guys simply HAVE to try this. I'm not kidding. See what I did there? I didn't know which movie he wanted me to review, so in an amazing display of innovation, I have created a new reviewing medium. The Dual-Review style. It can serve many purposes. First off, it can enhance two mediocre movies to make a sort of super-movie. Secondly, it can save time on reviewing. I never imagined I could increase my productivity by DOUBLE! And third off, the reader (you guys) can benefit from the review because it's something they just can't get anywhere else. THIS is why I'm the reviewer of the future. I fascinate myself sometimes. Partial credit can be given to my friend, since he reccommended one of these movies, but I'm still not sure which one. Later.  <br /> <br />howardtuttleman.com
084428596X|5.0|Let me start by saying I came from a beginning Norwegian language class where the textbook was entirely in Norwegian; the index, instructions, EVERYthing. Does that make sense to speak a language to someone who doesn't know it and is trying to learn? I understand the theory behind it, but it's just not practical. So naturally I looked for outside help.<br />I found that help with this book by Janus. He has a great way of laying out, in an easy-to-read-and-follow format, just EXACTLY how something is said and WHY it's said that way.<br />------------<br />The Format:<br />------------<br /><br />Each area covers every aspect of formal and informal grammar starting with a paragraph or two about what a given funtion or part of speech means (ex: The present participle are adjective forms based on verbs such as the \\"ing\\" in thinking)<br />Then you'll get examples and the book backs EVERYthing up with its English translation right next to them for immediate reference and confirmation.<br />What struck me about this book was that you don't even have to be a student of the Norwegian language and you could still thumb through it in order to see how Norwegians speak, just out of curiosity. It also has several sections for reference like numbers, a healthy list of verbs and their tenses, and even a section listing the 100 most popular names for males and females.
0380002930|5.0|What could I possibly say about this beautiful book that hasn't already been said? This book is magical.  <br /> <br />Although I regret admitting it, at 27 years old I was a latecomer to this unexpectedly remarkable story about a nest of rabbits fleeing thier warren to seek a home away from the destructiveness of mankind. Not to worry: it isn't a preachy environmental book, at least no more than Lord of the Rings is (courtesy of the talking tree-like Ents). <br /> <br />But it's so much more than that. All great stories, from the Iliad to Star Wars, are simple on the surface and yet have deeper meaning underlying it. Watership Down is no exception and should be regarded as highly as most---if not any given---\\"great\\" works. Small children can enjoy the adventure and colorful characters, whereas adults can enjoy the social commentary and allegory (as well as the adventure and colorful characters, of course).  <br /> <br />Adams did a lot of research on rabbit life before writing his novel, and it shows. Not once do you forget that these are rabbits you are following. They recognize each other by touching noses; they discuss \\"passing hraka\\" (defecating) as frankly as we discuss what we had for breakfast; they routinely practice coprophagy (\\"chewing pellets\\": feeding on their own dung); they are uncomfortable sleeping aboveground; they can discern the differences among several scents on the air. The list goes on. You see the world not from a human's perspective but a rabbit's. The narration is rabbit-level, meaning the reader is down in the dank burrows and eye-level with all sorts of plant-life I never knew existed. (Adams must have done a lot of research on flora, as well.) Bottom line: These are true rabbits with rabbit-like qualities, not rabbits with humanistic attitudes and outlooks and intelligence. And yet there is something fundamental about these characters, something familiar and archetypal and, well, human.     <br /> <br />Speaking of archetypes, they're all here: the strong one, the prophet, the leader, the bard, the jester, the villian, etc. But, again, like those in all great stories, these sorts of characters are effective only if they go beyond the category under which readers often place them, and Adams does a fine job indeed making his rabbits familiar in the Jungian sense and, at the same time, unique.  <br /> <br />Who would have thought that you could sustain a story about rabbits (and, remember, these are REAL rabbits, not Disney rabbits) for 400 pages? But as I got closer to the final pages, the more melancholy I grew. I did not want this book to end. I did not want to leave Watership Down and say goodbye to Bigwig and Dandelion and Fiver and Bluebell and, hell, even General Woundwort. And Hazel . . . By Frith, if you don't shed a tear after reading the epilogue, you are congenitally unfeeling. It gives me chills now as I write this.  <br /> <br />I've gone on longer than I intended, but that just proves how much I love this book. I can't recommend it enough.
B000063DI9|5.0|Ok I'll be honest you people. I am a classic 80's metal fan. This is Maiden's last 80's album. After this, it's the 90's and now which does not even compare to the most best and beloved 80's decade ever. In other words, this album and all of their previous albums (in my opinion) are great. I don't have a favorite album nor is this ablum the best. To me, they all have the same fantastic greatness, and I love that. <br /> <br />The reason why I dont like the 90's and now is simply because bands change throughout decade, to decade. Like Metallica, I love metallica but for only thier classic 80's music. When the 90's came, they have tottaly changed. By that, Metallica sucks now. Iron Maiden is the same way. This is thier last 80's album that of course has the same exact greatness as thier other previous albums. After this, they change just like Metallica and drop into the crap hole which I will not buy any ablums that's 90's to now. I only buy thier 80's greatness. <br /> <br />I know eveyone has thier favorite decade. Mine is the 80's and I wish it was the 80's now and would never end. But unfortanatly life sucks and here we are now. If you love the 80's as much as I do or a Maiden fan in any way, buy this album. To me it is just as good as all thier previous albums. Classic 80's Maiden is my favorite band next to classic 80's Metallica. <br />
B000003TAL|4.0|Daydream Nation is a legendary underground album, which seems to reflect Sonic Youth's mood on their careers, and their unique observations on the underground subculture of drug use and violence. Sonic Youth meshed perfectly in this album, to create their catchiest and most meaninful songs ever. Teenage Riot is a fantastic song, as is Eric's Trip and Candle. Its an album that looks at what others miss, what others don't want to see. The slackers, the bums, a nation of decaying youth is out there, and Sonic Youth, through distorted guitars and dissonant melodies, makes it known.
B0002O06N0|5.0|i bought this the day it came out.  i had heard a cut on the local public radio.  i played it a few times and enjoyed it.  but i recently got it back out, and, maybe it needed the summer heat to make me really hear it for what it is.  this album is a scorcher.  it seems to me that people somehow lump it in a category with the white stripes.  to me, there's no comparison.  this music is raw, exciting, bold, explosive, and RANDY.  if i had to compare it to anything, it would have to be the band Free...at least, it seems to me that this is what i always imagined Free could have sounded like.  don't fall for the white stripes comparisons...this is not novelty music.  this is the real stuff.  play it loud and enjoy it.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|:    M. Hart \\"Sci-Fi Fan did a good job of descibing each song, but his rating system was off. How many CD's you have that you would rate more that half of the tracks over 5 stars? this is how the rating system should be: <br />5+= couldn't be any better <br />5= almost perfect <br />4= pretty damn good <br />3= Average <br />2= not good <br />1=sucks <br /> <br />Now this is how the songs should be rated: <br /> <br />Prelude 3.0-(2)boring, ok to lestin to once or twice, i usually skip it <br />The Blister Exists-(4) sets CD off perfectly <br />Three Nil-(5) My favorite song on the record, mostly because of the chorus, Fast and just bad ass. <br />Duality-(5) Perfect for a first single, it wont get old for however long you listen to it. <br />Opium of the People-(3) Great chorus, the rest is alright, still good. <br />Circle-(2.5to a 3. I cant decide, i find myself singing along a lot) Most people buy a SlipKnot CD for the harder stuff. THis song is a little slow for my liking. Great lyrics but it could be better. I wish the whole song was like the last 30 seconds. <br />Welcome-(4) Back to the hard stuff. I love it! <br />Vermilion-(3) Good song. Just average. Not much else to say. <br />Pulse of the Maggots-(4.5) Bad ass. Love this song. Fast, Great lyrics, Fast gutar, typical SlipKNot greatness, Actually very Insperational. \\"WHat wont kill us will make us stronger!\\" <br />Before i forget-(5) Arguably the best song of the record. His voice, the drums, and to top it off the music video is awesome. Great song. <br />Vermilion Pt. 2-(5) yes its slower but coreys voice is so good! Great lyrics. Good solid song.  <br />The Nameless-(3.5) Great lyrics! have a fence sitter listen to it. The thing that bugs me is that when you think the song is really going to get fast and hard it slows down. Irritating. Good Verses though. <br />The Virus of Life-(1.5) Only real song i could just never get into on this record. I dont like the lyrics, the music or the meaning. <br />Danger - Keep Away-(3)Alright song. Really sad but whoever says coreys voice isn't good is the biggest dumb ass i've ever known. Musics kinda weird. <br /> <br />Ok, there you have it. How the songs should be rated. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007XT87G|2.0|I was so excited to hear about the new album and even more so when I actually picked up a copy. Unfortunately, I was so disappointed. I tried to be fair and gave it a long time thinking that maybe at some point it would sink in and I would start loving it. Not the case. The more I listened, the less I thought of the album. Immature heavy riffs and plain silly lyrics... I just felt that very little effort was made on this album. <br /> <br />Secondly, I do not understand people that group this album with In Absentia! They are so distinct! In Absentia is full of pure \\"Wilsonism\\", strange ideas and fusions of various styles and heart felt music. Nothing like Deadwing. <br /> <br />I guess it depends. I fell in love with Porcupine Tree because of Lightbulb Sun, Stupid Dream, and Recordings. This album just does not compare.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I was told by many people that you have to accept this movie on its own terms, that it doesn't have much of a plot, and that it is rather pointless. The prospect of this is did not excite me, as such a movie did not seem to lend itself to the kind of cultural analysis that I enjoy subjecting to everything I watch. It turns out this isn't entirely true. I guess you could see this film as a postmodern character study or a statement about the strange psychological development of an eccentric adolescent. But of course if I did that then it would betray the very thing that the movie is about, which is: not much. It's basically a movie about a goofy kid who comes from a goofy family who incessantly does and says goofy but hilarious things. I can see now how this movie has gained cult hit status in such a short time, with college students everywhere quoting their favorite lines. Mine is, \\"Yeah hold on ... I forgot to put in the crystals.\\" You'll get it when you see it.  <br />
B00008BXJG|5.0|Well, here we are, the last Bon Scott album, and probably the most popular of his era, its popular for a reason, its great, I shouldn't need to say much about this, get it.
1577312082|5.0|I reached enlightenment earlier this year after absorbing an incredible amount of emotional distress as a result of a best friend being sent away a couple of thousand miles east among other things.  My pain was so great that eventually I felt it pass away as my upper thought processes became void.  I then felt an incredible energy passing through my mid-section which felt like a full body orgasm.  The exstacy was amazing.  That was in February.  Tonight by just listening to the authors words and voice I got there again.  Its incredibly easy, so there's no reason why you shouldn't have the same access. :) Peace and blessings.
B000089RV6|5.0|Well, here we are again, new vocalist (R.I.P Bon), new era, and Brian Johnson is great, I always liked Bon and Brian, some don't, it's a taste, I don't need to say much about this one, this is they're greatest seller. <br />
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This album is seriously astounding.  I fell in love with the first track 20 seconds into my first listen.  Each subsequent song grows on me more and more.  The scope and depth of this CD easily surpass any of Sufjan's other (great) works to date.  It is going to be very hard to top this album, but he has yet to dissapoint so far in his brilliant young career.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|One of the best Bon Scott albums, next to Powerage, and Let There Be Rock, and of course Highway To Hell, this was the first semi-good selling one they did, all tracks are classics, but the best, are Its a Long Way to the Top (If you wanna Rock 'n' Roll, Live Wire, T.N.T, The Jack, Little Lover, and High Voltage, if you're new to AC/DC, i'd probably suggest Back In Black, but for people who have been into them for a while, get this.
B00022XOAO|5.0|To comment on this performance I can use only one word: magnificent. Further comments would be superflous and inadequate. The cd sound is quite good for its times and for a live recording.
B00008WT5C|5.0|Classic album, and underrated for the most part, every song, classic, this was the guitar album, get it
B00004RFCM|3.0|The efficiency of doing business with Amazon leaves nothing to be desired.  The Product was satisfactory. <br /> <br />Thank you, <br /> <br />Lorenzo
B00008WT5E|5.0|CRIMINALLY, underrated...I can't even explain, every song on here, is great, great performance from Bon as well, but he was always great, but this is one of his best, buy this album <br />
0790744295|5.0|Creepshow has to be the scariest movie I have ever seen in my 22 years of life. Nothing has come close to keeping from wetting myself while watching a film. True horror genious that still scares me today. Good stuff that I recommend every single person to watch.
B000068PQ0|4.0|This is overall an excellent album. It starts off with a bang with my personal favorite song, \\"fight test\\". My only issue with it is that it starts to get a little weak towards the end; It's Summertime, All We Have Is Now, and Approaching Pavonis Mons... just don't impress me. Most of the cd is awesome though, so buy it anyway.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Back in 1989, I was extremely excited about the release of Tim Burton's BATMAN. And when I finally got to see the film, I remember sitting back in my seat, enjoying the moment...the moment when I finally got to see my favorite comic-book character on the big screen.         So after several viewings, I talked about how much I enjoyed it and thought it was great. Unfortunately I wasn't being totally honest with myself. While I did enjoy the \\"moment\\", I didn't necessarily enjoy the film.              The bat costume was rigid. Gotham City looked fake. Commissioner Gordon was a joke. Bruce gets Vicky Vale drunk and sleeps with her on the first date. The Joker kills Wayne's parents, creating this bizarre you-made-me/no-you-made-me dynamic (and to clear up some confusion for a couple of reviewers here: Joe Chill killed Bruce Wayne's parents in the comics, NOT the Joker).         Worst of all, the screenplay was just plain bad. Horrible dialogue, especially between Bruce and Vicky.         Over the years I've come to terms with the fact that Burton's BATMAN is just not a very good movie. And his sequel BATMAN RETURNS is worse.         So when people blame Joel Schumacher for destroying the Batman franchise, I'm not so hard on him. Yes, BATMAN FOREVER and BATMAN & ROBIN were lousy...yes, worse than the Burton films. But in my humble opinion, the seeds of failure were planted by Burton himself. For all the talk about how dark Tim Burton's vision of Batman was, some campiness managed to seep out, especially in scenes between Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman and Danny DeVito's Penguin. Schumacher just took it to the next level.         But BATMAN BEGINS is the real deal. This time, the filmakers wanted to make a good movie, not just a blockbuster event. Director Chris Nolan and co-screenwriter David Goyer wanted to make a Batman film with a real story. A story about fear...conquering it and, when necessary, dispensing it.         It's also about a young man (Christian Bale) so distraught over the murder of his parents he journeys across the world seeking the means to fight injustice. This is where Ra's al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) and Ducard (Liam Neeson) enter the picture. These two characters and their \\"League of Shadows\\" organization direct Bruce Wayne in his quest, inspiring him to be \\"more than just a man\\".         In the comics, Ra's al Ghul has been one of Batman's most powerful villains since the early 70's. I don't recall him having anything to do with Batman's origin, but it makes perfect sense in the context of the film...a credit to BATMAN BEGINS' excellent screenplay.         The screenplay also features wonderful dialogue that previous Batman scribes Sam Hamm and Akiva Goldsman could never hope to write, such as the moment when Bruce Wayne realizes that his mentors against \\"evil\\" have a disturbing agenda:         Ra's al Ghul: \\"Gotham's time has come. Like Constantinople and Rome before it...the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice...it is beyond saving and must be allowed to die. This is the most important function of the League of Shadows. It is one we have performed for centuries. Gotham must be destroyed.\\"         That's good stuff.         Anyway, it's at that point that Bruce Wayne comes back to Gotham City and, with help from his butler/moral compass Alfred (played with warmth and humor by the great Michael Caine), discovers the best way to strike against the criminals of Gotham is to make them good and scared...to become Batman. For reasons explained early in the film, Bruce has been afraid of bats most of his life, so as he explains at a point in the film, \\"it's time my enemies shared my dread.\\"         Along the way we meet several characters, good-guys and bad. Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox, an employee of Wayne Enterprises. He's an actual character from the comics, but tweaked just enough to be involved in the action...which is a good thing considering it's MORGAN FREEMAN for goodness sakes!We also meet Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) who is Bruce's childhood friend. Her character is not from the comics but she's not a bad inclusion. She serves the purpose of grounding Bruce back into reality...quite literally slapping some sense into the boy during one moment. There have been some negative comments about Holmes' performance, but I think she was quite good.         Most importantly, we meet police detective Sgt James Gordon. Gary Oldman is wonderfully weary as the one good cop left in Gotham City. BATMAN BEGINS really captures the spirit of the comics and the unlikely friendship between Batman and Gordon is one of the many reasons why.         As for the villains, I couldn't have asked for a more appropriate actor to portray Ra's al Ghul. He's just perfect. Tom Wilkinson is surprisingly menacing as crime boss Carmine Falcone. And Cillian Murphy is Jonathon Crane, a criminal psychologist who becomes the Scarecrow when he puts on a mask and sprays fear-inducing gas.        I never would have considered the Scarecrow as one of the first villains in a movie about Batman's origin, but I once again have to hand it to the screenplay for blending his character seamlessly into the plot. A plot in which fear is the central theme, after all. There are some genuinely chilling moments involving the Scarecrow, maybe too scary for young children.         The film also has some decidedly cinematic moments, such as car chases featuring the cool humvee-style Batmobile. Batman's ability to glide thru the air with his cape (trust me, it's explained in the film), and an almost James Bond-like plot to destroy Gotham by poisoning the air with fear toxin. But these moments never feel too over-the-top or phony. It helps that the action is done with very little CGI effects. No, these cinematic touches merely add to the fun.         When it's all said and done, this movie is about Batman. We really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is and why he has to become this (as one character puts it) monster. Christian Bale is ideal as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Unlike others who have donned the cowl, Bale GETS it...he understands.         And when I see images from the film of Batman crouched on some building, cape flowing in the night air as he looks down upon the city, I know the filmakers of BATMAN BEGINS understand too.     BATMAN BEGINS is not just the best Batman movie ever, it's the best film of the summer and one of the best films of the year. This movie is intense, humorous, dark and exciting. STAR WARS, EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH and WAR OF THE WORLDS may end up making more money by the end of the summer, but audiences are finding BATMAN BEGINS infinitely more satisfying. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?
B0006L16N8|2.0|the first coldplay song i ever heard was 'shiver'. i liked it enough to buy the single and was further impressed when i later heard 'yellow'. the two catchy singles gave me the impression that their debut album, 'parachutes', would be something to look forward to. i wasn't unimpressed but underwhelmed. i felt it was a promising album and i liked the wide-eyed, naivety of it.     the jump from 'parachutes' to 'a rush of blood to the head' was immense. the first song on the album, 'politik', immediately showed their growth. chris martin was now singing, \\"look at earth from out of space, everyone must find their place,\\" a big jump from 'yellow' where he sang, \\"look at the stars, see how they shine for you,\\" no longer looking up at the sky, martin was now up in space looking down. this mirrored his band's new status. 'parachutes' made them popular in the uk but 'arobtth' put them into the stratosphere.     so their third album should in theory make them one of the biggest bands in the vast music universe. 'x&y' has gone number 1 in a number of countries including here in the states. obviously it will sell probably a billion copies as people buy it to see what the fuss is about. do the numbers reflect the songs though?    first single 'speed of sound' sounds like a small version of clocks. it did eventually grow on me but it still feels like coldplay are retreading old ground. i've read a number reviews saying this new album is sonically more interesting and denser. all the synths and weird noises can't save lines like, \\"i could write a song, a hundred miles long,\\" as martin sings on 'swallowed in the sea'. this is the reason i've only rated this album 2 out of 5. if it was not for the sincerity that martin sings i would be cringing at various points throughout the album.     on their previous albums martin sings in the first person. an example being on 'the scientist' where he says, \\"come up to meet you, tell you i'm sorry, you don't know how lovely you are,\\" that albumwas full of personal songs. it made me feel like i was getting a small glimpse into another person's life and in particular their heartbreak. with 'x&y' the tables are now turned. martin is now so confident he wants to turn the focus on us, the listener.    for me this was the biggest problem i had with this album. i'm sure i'm being overly sensitive but there seems to be an on-going theme where martin feels he has to remind me i'm incompetent. on the kraftwerk-sampling 'talk' he sings, \\"are you lost or incomplete? do you feel like a puzzle you can't find your missing piece?  tell me how you feel\\" besides a bad metaphor and sounding like dr. phil, it is condescending. who does martin think his audience is? a bunch of emotionally-stilted introverts in need of rescue? things get worse on 'low' when he states, \\"all you ever wanted was love, but you never look hard enough,\\" well gee, thanks for telling me that, and he wonders why some people call his music depressing. i could carry on with similar lyrics but that would be as annoying as the lyrics themselves.     to be fair the album's main theme is of love and loss. the opposite feelings of complete happiness and the pain of losing someone or something. the x and y if you will. so highlights? only one comes to mind and that is 'fix you'. if martin really does think his audience are emotionally-stilted introverts this would be the song to rescue them. starting with just martin's vocal and an organ it starts slowly and doesn't get interesting until johnny buckland's guitar chimes in. the momentum builds and climaxes with will champion's drums and guy berryman's bass filling in the technicolour wall of sound. i'm sure by now this has become the song known as, \\"the one where they sing a four-part harmony,\\" more just a gimmick it sounds warm and inviting. it's what they do best, simple songs about love.    you may be thinking, hold on, i'm contradicting myself at the moment. i don't like this album because of the examplesi showed earlier but yet my favourite song features the line, \\"tears stream down your face, when you lose something you cannot replace,\\" so yes i am contradicting myself but i guess that's the x and y of me.    'x&y' is an accomplished album. the new sounds show some evolution and a hint that they may sound more electronic in the future. this third time around they seem more like a real band. on the previous albums it could just have easily been martin solo with a backing band. these new songs though sound like they'd fall apart if one member was taken away. you get to see more of their personalities through the songs. johnny this time is louder and less shy. will sounds solid and powerful. guy provides life with his slinky basslines. and chris? he's just chris.    i really wanted to love this album. i tell myself that it'll grow on me but i know it won't. it's like when you're already in love with something. if something different comes along, you know it doesn't feel right and you don't want to settle for anything less. 'a rush of blood to the head' is that something. 'x&y' will have to deal with the rejection. from me at least.
B00004VVND|5.0|I saw this film back in 1975 as an 8 year old. I loved it then and it still holds up for me years later. Yul Brynner's role as the robot gunslinger really left an impact on me. He really is the highlight of the film, although there are many other good things to watch Westworld for. It is not the best sci-fi flick ever made, but I still feel that it holds up today as an entertaining movie. The musical score by Fred Karlin is especially disturbing at times and it really added to the excitement of the last part of the movie. Yul Brynner modeled his robot gunslinger after the character he portrayed in The Magnificent Seven. The first part of the movie follows a number of guests as they travel in to the world of their choice in Delos, a theme park of the future where eventually things go terribly wrong and most of the guests are killed off with the last part of the movie dealing with Yul Brynner tracking down Richard Benjamin with only one purpose...to kill him. Suspenseful action, a chilling musical score, good acting and an ending that left me drained when I originally saw it make this a movie worth watching. What are you waiting for...watch this movie today!
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I have learned something over listening to many many hours of music, IF YOU LIKE A SONG JUST LIKE IT dont say ah this band is such a sell out how lame, the only band i will still continue to do that with is Metallica after the Avirl incident. This CD is awesome cept for like 2 songs.
1573223085|4.0|This author has evidently done a lot of inner and personal work.  He is learning and living his life in alignment with what he is professing.  Who else would take a 5 day class on learning to draw when they consider themselves poor in drawing?    My one major concern in Pink's logic is that MBAs are \\"out\\" and MFAs are \\"in\\" because according to Pink these type of skills of a MBA can be replicated in the other countries such as China and India where the cost for analytical skills are much lower. I guess my concern is that India and China will not only be able to produce analytical skills but Pink's highly touted conceptual and design skills as well.  So my conclusion on this \\"thought experiment\\" is that the world economy will be drastically changed.  What can not be outsourced one may ask?  Is there anything distinctly human and local that we need each other for?  Some how the gifting economies over the internet like Wikipedia offer some interest models.    The central tenet of the book is the need for merging the skills and aptitudes of our left brain with the those of our right brains.  Since our culture already values highly those left brain skills of logic and mathematics what is needed in order for us to thrive in the new world is those right brain holistic skills of creativity, art and beauty.    Some of my favorite things in the book.  1) The toilet brush designed by the famous Michael Graves  2) The quote from Karimanifesto \\"Don't specialize\\" and \\"Experience is the most important part of living\\"  3) The photo of Kasparov slumped over the chess board and he is playing with Deep Blue. (my guess)    Have fun reading this recommended book. I think it furthers the conversation and that is about the most any body of knowledge can do at this point.
1400034779|3.0|This is a book so simple written it hurts itself. It keeps flowing in one simple direction and never turns back. I thought of it to be a good one but when I started reading this I noticed that the landscape was more important than the works Mma Ramotswe is dealing with, so I am giving this book this rating
B00005JNNZ|4.0|Samuel Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Star Wars Episode 3: Return Of The Sith) delivers one of his most outstanding performances as Coach Ken Carter.     The movie is based on the true story of how Carter influenced high schools across the country to choose academics before athletics as an important factor of athletic students' success through school and after by challenging a Richmond, California high school to think again on where they will lead the kids if they do not take it into consideration. As a teacher, I found what Carter did despite the community's hostility towards his decision to close down the school gym until the team's grades went up as revolutionary.     The movie is a basketball movie (the most exciting scenes are when the team are winning basketball), but it focuses more on how Carter actually teaches them the value of education, discipline, and respect, thus coaching them through life.    Recommended    B+
B0000019PA|5.0|Neutral Milk Hotel is pretty much singer/songwriter Jeff Mangum's musical Frankenstein; and this album, the epitome of his talents so far, certainly ranks as one of the most distinctive, brilliant, and unusual albums of the 90's. In any case, it certainly seems to grow more powerful and and potent with time, as does the extent of its influence. It can be argued that \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" set the standard for ATIR (Acquired Taste Indie Rock) paving the way for today's popular indie artists such as The Arcade Fire and Joanna Newsom, especially the latter, who is clearly indebted to Mangum's shrill, naked vocals, and emotionally vivid sense of what-have-you.  <br /> <br />Neutral Milk hotel was one of the most visible outposts of the Elephant Six Recording Collective (disbanded in 2002) which also included bands like Olivia Tremor Control, Beulah, and Of Montreal. All these bands applied the use of exotic instrumentation, but perhaps none better than Neutral Milk who use instruments like the singing saw and wandering genie to wondrous effect here. <br /> <br />It has been said that this album is a loosely-structured concept album about World War II, having come to fruition after a string of dark and immediate dreams Mangum had about Anne Frank in hiding. He has spoken of this in concert. His voice is akin to a shredded piece of metal burning at one end, but I can't recall another singer in the last ten years or so whose emotional life and sense of theatrics are that effective. His wounded vocals match perfectly his stunning symbolist lyrics, giving birth to songs such as \\"Holland 1945\\" which goes something like:  <br /> <br />\\"The only girl I ever loved was born with roses in her eyes but then they buried her alive one evening 1945 with just her sister at her side and only weeks before the guns all came and rained on everyone now she's a little boy in Spain playing pianos filled with flames on empty rings around the sun all sing to say my dream has come...\\" <br /> <br />\\"Holland 1945\\" is one of the great indie rock tracks of all time, a noisy, frenetic mishmash of rock n' roll styles, with a trumpet searing through the jubilation like a beam from a lighthouse. The title track is also a beautiful, melancholic stunner, which boasts that ghostly saw, and Mangum's most accomplished and heart-wrenching vocal performance.  <br /> <br />The first two tracks on the album typify the best of contemporary folk rock, the wondrous and ironic religiosity of \\"King of Carrot Flowers Pts. Two and Three\\" cutting into the album's opening track, \\"The King of Carrot Flowers\\", which is pretty much just Mangum and his guitar, but somehow mesmerizing, haunting, and unique all the same. \\"Two-Headed Boy\\" is another breathtaking triumph as well: stilted, strange, off-kilter, yet again, completely effective. <br /> <br />I would say that if the album has a flaw it would be the placement of the stronger arrangements and songwriting in the first half of the album, like a rickety rowboat with everyone on one side; but even slightly weaker later songs such as \\"Communist Daughter\\", \\"Two Headed Boy Pt. Two\\" and lush, instrumental songs such as the album's untitled 10th track only serve to further the album's agenda: the creation of a tangible, evocative, dreamy and absolute transportative universe, where anyone would want to visit for a half hour or so. <br /> <br />This CD will always come up on my list of albums to recommend friends looking for that overlooked gem. I always say: \\"Just get it. You may not like it at first, but don't worry. One day you will.\\"
B000068QY7|4.0|Oasis is the most significant rock band in Britain since The Rolling Stones. Their concerts still sell out within hours or days, they still make music, and they've replaced more band members than the Stones themselves.  <br /> <br />On 2002's Heathen Chemistry, their renovated band consisted of four songwriters (Noel was the only songwriter of the band before Liam discovered his talent, and Gem and Andy joined). Each member excluding drummer Alan White contributes to the album making Heathen Chemistry a group effort just like, dare I say, The Beatles.  <br /> <br />Noel has six tracks to his name this time around, but most of them just don't make a good lasting impression: the first single and a UK number one hit, the oddly titled The Hindu Times, sounds like a reminiscence of past smashing tunes like Roll With It and Supersonic with the use of layers of guitars and lyrics that include the words 'sunshine' and 'rain'. However Times lacks the energy and the charisma that would make this song stick for a long time. Force Of Nature is a Dylan-esque foot stomping tune, which Noel has been sounding a lot like lately. Force would have sounded better as a b-side instead of a second, or any, track on the album. She Is Love and Little By Little are both attempts to grasp old glory, with the latter sounding like an excellent American radio-friendly tune but oddly not released in America. Probably All In The Mind is a song I can easily say that's the least attractive number on the album. Stop Crying Your Heart Out is by far one of the best songs Noel has written in a long time, a heart wrenching sing along tune. <br /> <br />Liam on the other hand contributes what has turned out to be the highlights on the album: the old fashioned rocker Better Man, the dark haunting ode to his son Lennon, Born On A Different Cloud, in which Liam mysteriously sounds exactly like John Lennon, and the deliciously good ballad Songbird, which is one of the best love songs Oasis has ever made. <br/> <br />Andy Bell, previously in the bands Ride and Hurricane #1 where he was one of the main songwriters, only offers a short instrumental piece called A Quick Peep, which would have been better off off the album (Andy would go on to write excellent tunes on the follow up Don't Believe The Truth). While Gem Archer offers the most Oasis sounding track Hung In A Bad Place, a song that has the same foot stomping affect that past hits like Roll With It had, but just not as memorable and falls in the same trap as The Hindu Times. <br /> <br />Heathen Chemistry is applaudable simply for the fact that the entire group pitched in. You can sense the coordination between Liam, Noel, Andy and Gem throughout the album. Ironically, Heathen Chemistry would be Alan White's last with Oasis; he would be replaced later on with Ringo Starr's son Zak Starkey. <br /> <br />Is it worth the aggravation? <br /> <br />Yes, if you're looking into appreciating Don't Believe The Truth, and most definitely if you are an Oasis fan. <br /> <br />Heathen Chemistry is not Oasis's strongest effort since Morning Glory as some might say, but neither is it their weakest. <br /> <br />Track picks: <br /> <br />Stop Crying Your Heart Out <br />Songbird <br />Little By Little <br />Born On A Different Cloud <br />Better Man <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B- <br />
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Ok, the book is a classic masterpiece. Nobody will dispute that. But stop comparing an action movie, made with star power to make millions of dollars, with the book! Its like comparing apples with automobiles.<br /><br />On to the movie...<br /><br />Sure Brad Pitts role as Achilles is questionable, it still works. He puts on the right amount of flair of ego and ultimately makes his onscreen persona shine. I especially liked his death sequence. While it was far from a surprise, i thought it was well done when he plucked every arrow except the one aimed at his famous weak point.<br /><br />And Eric Bana. He was the real star of this movie. He played the noble-loved by all-warrior to a T. His character was so easily likable and made the tremendous Achilles vs Hector fight scene one to remeber.<br /><br />Sean Bean, straight from his Boromir role, played Odyssesys remarkably. His was another character that truly stood out, and its a bit sad that his character didnt have more on screen time.<br /><br />Though i must say that Bloom as Paris was terrible. He was weak, annoying, and very hate worthy. Though Helen was played very well for what she had to work with. They picked a great actress to play her part as anything less than a gorgeus model would not have worked to be worthy for a 'thousand ships.'<br /><br />All in all it was a tremendous movie and was very well paced and exciting. No scenes ever dragged on and that was surprising for a long movie like this. So put aside the classic story and the Oscars and enjoy this movie for what it is.
B000286RKW|5.0|Goodfellas has got to be one of my alltime favorite movies,right up there with Godfather and Godfather Part II.  Great acting and really puts you into the life of a gangster Dinero and Pesci are just a lil bit perfect together.  All this being said I also want to comment on some of the reviewers who say you have to flip it over that is the old version and based on the dates of the reviews the Special Eddition has been out for a while now and you don't have to turn the disc over which makes it that much better, I too had the original you had to flip and rushed out and got special edition right away once I heard it was all on one disc anyway just thought that those who were missing out should know that.

0141301120|3.0|At the end of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, we leave Charlie and his family flying with Mr. Wonka in the great glass elevator. With that marvelous machine, Dahl leaves behind any creative inhibition and sends the whole family up to outer space, where they meet some very scary characters (e.g., the Vermicious Knids, whom I found particularly scary as a young reader). In the second part of the book, the family returns to earth, and Mr. Wonka uses some of his most impressive inventions to coax Charlie's three bedridden grandparents back to their feet so they can help in the chocolate factory. <br /> <br />This book is full of silly fun, from the former nanny of the President of the United States (who is now a most overbearing vice-president) to a bizarre journey to minusland (the place people go when they are under zero years old). <br /> <br />The lack of a strong plot makes it much less compelling than the previous book. My wife and I read the book aloud, and we were much more likely to put the book down and not pick it up for a while. But I enjoyed all the wacky adventures as well as the Dahl's trademark portrayal of adults at their worst.

B0007Y4USW|5.0|For all those people who say that Mimi can't sing, they're wrong. I guess they've never bought a CD like this one. Every song on this CD is so great and you can relate to it. She is the best female of all time for a reason. She sings so good, when you've the chance to see or hear her live, you will be amased. It will be hard the do better than The Emancipation Of Mimi, but Mimi still had a lot of potential. She can and will do it. Mariah is back and some artists (like Madonna) are jealous 'cause they aren't as popular as they once were. The Emancipation of Mimi is a must-have for all of you. I've 3 favorite songs. <br />1) We Belong Together: this is one of the best songs she's ever released and this song is her 16th #1. She proves she can sing and write from her heart. Just love it <br />2) Circles: the lyrics are super, I can relate to this songs 'cause I've been there too.  <br />3) Fly Like a Bird: it is the best way to end a CD, she shows she can hit those high notes perfectly and I love the lyrics. <br />I've bought this CD the same day it was released. I hope that she records many CD's like this one. <br />Mariah Carey is the best singer, songwriter and performer of all time!!
B0000009SM|5.0|This album caps 10 years of this amazing band. Encompassing blues, rock, show & jazz music, this is a zappa masterpiece. A great starting point for rock fans averse to his more overtly 'satirical' contributions. <br /> <br />His electric guitar playing on po-jama people and inca roads is as good any i've ever heard
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|There were a lot of people who had issues with season 2 -- mostly because it didn't resemble season 1.  but this season, while sometimes inconsistent, was more nuanced, textured, real and ultimately rewarding... The 2nd half of the season was especially great -- the Rain episode, Trey's return, Julie's porn scandal, Kirsten and Sandy's marriage headed for trouble... and the finale.  No matter who complained about the season, everyone was devastated by the last ten minutes.  What other show makes you laugh, gasp, cry, feel and rock out like the OC.  nothing else like it on tv.  buy it!
0316172324|5.0|This is an excellent, thought-provoking book, as was Tipping Point. I found it to be a fascinating and entertaining read. Malcolm Gladwell is terrific, as always.

B00001SIES|5.0|MUSE is such an amazing band, extracting pure melancholy from the heart and transforming it into musical form. SHOWBIZ, the bands first album, is remarkably diverse and intricate. Kicking off the CD is \\"Sunburn\\", and one can not ask for a better opening track. Every track on here is worth the money. \\"Muscle Museum\\" and \\"Fillip\\" prove the emotion and passion that is rooted within Matt's voice and the bands overall talent. Other beauties such as \\"Falling Down\\", \\"Cave\\", and \\"Overdue\\" round out the exquisiteness of such an album. I cannot praise this enough! Muse is without question one of the best bands today. You will not be disappointed!
B00082IJ08|5.0|Although I still like the first Gorillaz C.D. more, I would still consider Demon Days to be a very good album for both the rock and rap that is on it. There is a very wide variety of music on this C.D., from peaceful songs like El Manana to outgoing ones like the hit track Feel Good Inc. All sorts of sounds are used for the backgrounds too, such as high-pitched voices saying \\"All Alone\\" or electronic beep patterns. The song I would most recommend on this album is \\"Fire Coming Out of The Monkey's Head\\", which is basically a fantasy tale being read by Dennis Hopper. It is accompanied by guitar plucks, bass slides, and electronic chords that sound great together. I strongly like this C.D., and I would recommend it to Gorillaz fans and fans of alternative rock. <br />I recommend: <br />Last Living Souls <br />Kids With Guns <br />O Green World <br />Dirty Harry <br />Feel Good Inc. <br />Every Planet We Reach Is Dead <br />Novermber Has Come  <br />All Alone <br />White Light <br />Dare <br />Fire Coming Out of The Monkey's Head <br />Don't Get Lost In Heaven <br />
B0009XLDY0|5.0|I love John Wayne movies, and I love Amazon's dedication to offer the most for your dollar, so this Exclusive, to me, is the best of both worlds! While several 'signature' Wayne films (the Ford 'Cavalry' trilogy, in particular), are absent, and other 'classics' can be purchased individually, or in other boxed sets, this John Wayne DVD collection offers 10 of the Duke's most memorable films of the 60s and 70s...at less than $10, each! Talk about getting your money's worth!<br /><br />The titles include:<br /><br />\\"El Dorado\\" and \\"Rio Lobo\\": Howard Hawks' two variations of his classic, \\"Rio Bravo\\", all starring Wayne. \\"El Dorado\\", in particular, is a most worthy 'remake', offering Robert Mitchum in a wonderful comic send-up of the Dean Martin role, James Caan more entertaining than Ricky Nelson, and Arthur Hunnicutt, complete with bugle, filling Walter Brennan's shoes. Add Ed Asner as the villain, and Duke, standing tall (even while carrying a bullet inside him), and you have a first-rate actioner. While \\"Rio Lobo\\" is a disappointment (both Wayne and Hawks were sadly showing their years), it does offer the gorgeous (if wooden) Jennifer O'Neill, future studio boss Sherry Lansing, and Mitchum's son, Chris (along with an unbilled appearance by Wayne's youngest son, Ethan), in support.<br /><br />\\"Hatari!\\": One of the BEST Hawks/Wayne teamings, this vastly entertaining African comedy/adventure may be the longest 'Buddy' film ever made, at 157 minutes, but Wayne, with all-star support including Hardy Kr&uuml;ger, Elsa Martinelli, and Red Buttons, makes capturing wild animals for zoos and circuses an irresistable experience!<br /><br />\\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\": John Ford's last 'Classic' western, a deconstruction of the mythic West that he and Wayne helped create. Equal parts comedy and tragedy, with a healthy dose of old-fashioned politics, as Jimmy Stewart achieves national acclaim by shooting town bully Lee Marvin...an act actually done by Wayne! \\"When people prefer the myth to the truth, print the myth\\" is a credo Ford believed in, and this film is it's purest embodiment. A MUST!<br /><br />\\"Donovan's Reef\\": Ford and Wayne, teamed again with Lee Marvin, in a delightful South Seas romp, as prim Elizabeth Allen learns to 'loosen up' under Wayne's brawny charms (forget the 27-year age difference!) Brawling fun, with Jack Warden, Cesar Romero, and saronged Dorothy Lamour in support.<br /><br />\\"The Sons of Katie Elder\\": Most significant as being Wayne's triumphant return to the screen after losing a lung to cancer, this sprawling Henry Hathaway-directed western reteams Duke with Dean Martin (as BROTHERS?), in an entertaining tale of four brothers' vengeance; with a flavorful Elmer Bernstein score.<br /><br />\\"True Grit\\": Hathaway directs Wayne to an Oscar, as one-eyed Rooster Cogburn. An underappreciated gem (Duke playing an old, fat reprobate upset many fans), but he has a ball in the role, and few of his films captured the 'feel' of the period, better!<br /><br />\\"In Harm's Way\\": Otto Preminger and Wayne made a great team, in the director's HUGE saga of Pearl Harbor, and the early days of the Pacific war. No superhuman heroics, here, just a dedicated Naval officer (Wayne), his relationships (with Patricia Neal, Brandon De Wilde, and a superb Kirk Douglas), and his part in helping turn the tide of the war.<br /><br />\\"Big Jake\\": Violent, but engrossing late western, as Duke's grandson (played by son Ethan) is kidnapped by Richard Boone's gang, and his estranged wife (radiant Maureen O'Hara, in her last teaming), depends on him to recover the boy. Featuring another Wayne son, Patrick, Robert Mitchum's son, Chris, and MANY of the old John Ford 'stock company' in support; at times quite brutal, but still one of Wayne's best 'late' films.<br /><br />\\"The Shootist\\": Wayne's swansong is a loving tribute, despite the many difficulties his declining health caused. A legendary gunfighter must choose between dying from cancer or ina blaze of glory; from the wonderful opening montage of Wayne clips from several of his most popular westerns, to the bittersweet conclusion, a fitting film finale, with several 'old friends' in supporting roles.<br /><br />Bravo, Amazon!

B000056N8X|4.0|Highlander, for those that may be a little uninitiated, tells the story of a world where living among us are special individuals called Immortals.  An Immortal looks and acts like a regular mortal, however they cannot be killed by mortal means and have the ability to \\"sense\\" each other when in close proximity.  There are both good and evil Immortals that fight each other in constant battles to the death, ending when one takes the other's head and in turn releases all of the power and knowledge gained by that Immortal in one cataclysmic event known as the Quickening. <br /> <br />This continues until \\"In the end, there can be only one\\", meaning that the last Immortal standing has gained the powers of EVERY Immortal that ever lived, and if they wanted to could use that power to rule the world if they saw fit.  Think of it as a combination game of Tag, King of the Mountain, and Last Man Standing, with everyone Immortal being It. <br /> <br />Highlander has been popular for over 2 decades, starting with the movie series involving Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert), then switching over to the hit TV series featuring his descendant Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul).  So for many fans the inevitable question had to be \\"Would these 2 Highlanders ever meet up and what would be the end result?\\" <br /> <br />Well the answer comes in the form of Highlander: Endgame, which officially unites the movie and TV Highlanders for one battle that will not only change the scope of the Highlander world, but mark a final appearance for one of them as a Highlander.  <br /> <br />An evil Immortal named Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne) is on a mission with his band of cronies to find and slaughter as many Immortals as possible so that ultimately he will be that last Immortal standing.  But when a special society of Immortal monitors known as the Watchers learn of Kell's master plan, the main leader, Joe Dawson (Jim Byrnes) heads off to find Duncan and alert him.  Later, Duncan realizes that his only best hope is to team with his fellow Highlander Connor to fend off Kell.  But when during one battle a Highlander falls to Kell's sword, it comes down to a climactic battle between Kell and the remaining Highlander to finally decide who will be the only one that wins the final battle and more power than ever imagined. <br /> <br />This is a great movie as it not only finally brings the two MacLeods (Connor/Movie and Duncan/TV)together for the first time on the big screen (I do remember that they met in the pilot for the TV series), but it also brings one of the Highlander's associations with the series to an end and possibly paves the way for a new generation of Highlander series in the movies if so fit.  Additionally, Adrian Paul shows that his acting and sword-handling skills have improved dramatically since the end of the TV version. <br /> <br />All in all, it may be the endgame, but it also marks what could be a new beginning...
B00003OSTV|5.0|this is, IMO, the best of all of the christian epics. including \\"ben hur\\" and \\"the ten commandments.\\" it's magnificent in scope and in detail, and more human and passionate than it's competitors.    but this film is not for children. the scenes at the end, with the lions, are among the most terrifying in movie history. death is scary enough, and execution terrifying, and this adds an extraordinary element to it.    as a society, we once exposed children to too much violendce. we've learned since then, and i think it is important to turn this dvd off near the end if children are watching.
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|The Polar Express rates with the other classics of Christmas time, including Miracle on 34th Street, It's a Wonderful Life, A Christmas Carol, and many others.  <br /> <br />This is a movie that has all the magic of Christmas. It is a pity that it was released the same time as The Incredibles, so got overlooked by many. This story has several who need to learn a lesson, like the one who is losing all faith in Christmas, and is becoming cynical about other things. He is taken on the way by the Conductor, the mysterious Hobo and his companions. With it, a kid who has been left out of the magic, a know-it-all and others like them are given exactly what they need.  <br /> <br />I wish I had seen it on IMAX. The depth of the animation is incredible. The only weak part of the movie was that dance with the waiters, which I agree should have been left on the cutting room floor, as it distracted from the main theme.  <br /> <br />But, the DVD is worth waiting for. I'm putting it on my Christmas list. Don't ever lose the magic!

B0009MDPYM|1.0|Horrible and down right degrading adaptation of the comic book is a mishmash of stupidly masquerading as a film. Keanu Reeves should turn in his SAG card for his horrible performance and somebody should find the screenwriters of this movie and give them a good butt kicking for the horrible script they wrote. The direction is decent but it depends on the special effects way too much to tell its story and most of the special effects are not done very well anyway. Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are the only actors in the entire cast who give good performances and that's because they both do more with their characters than the script tries to do. Weisz gives a strength and humanity to her role while Stormare gives his brief but memorable role a touch of menace and camp. Too bad nether of them were not the leads in this film because I think the movie would have been much better if that was the case. Unfortunately, we have Keanu parading around in full matrix mold with a story that is as thin as tissue paper.  <br /> <br />
B000002UDG|4.0|Many a music fan will draw out the pluses and minuses in most greatest hits collages, especially when the artist concerned continually releases various wrappings labeled Greatest, Essential, The Best of, etc. Such is the case for the prolific talent, Sir James Paul McCartney, whose All the Best, which includes chart-topping hits and other favorites from 1971 up to the album's issue in 1987, should be regarded, in essence, as Some of the Best.    First, let's look at the downside. Missing are the favorite solo, pre-Wings favorites, Every Night and Maybe I'm Amazed, the latter of which is perhaps McCartney's most requested, post-Beatles track. As for the post-Wings material from the 1980's, excluded are the following: Tug of War (the title track of McCartney's last album to top the US charts), the top-10 hit, Take It Away, the beloved Here Today, and the innocent Pipes of Peace. Several Beatles and McCartney fans might begrudge these omissions, especially when the often critically panned Ebony & Ivory (with Stevie Wonder) and Say, Say, Say (with former friend Michael Jackson) are featured, instead. In defense, however, since these two last-mentioned songs spent a combined 13 weeks at Number 1 in the Billboard Hot 100's, they both could not be denied.    Another obvious flaw is the shortcoming that could only result from trying to put together on one disc an apt synopsis of two decades of work generated by the most successful musical artist of all time. So no justice could be done by summarizing a broad body of work in just over an hour.    On the positive end of the spectrum, there are contained in All the Best, much to my delight, tunes from the Paul McCartney & Wings era that were left out, somewhat to my chagrin, from his earlier greatest hits collection, entitled Wings Greatest. Most notable are the 1975 ahead-of-its-time, number one hit Listen to What the Man Said and the top-five hit from 1979, Goodnight Tonight, which came out the year after Wings Greatest.For those who want a more complete set of McCartney essentials without delving into the entire McCartney catalogue, I highly recommend the 40-track, digitally remastered Wingspan.    All in all, whether you choose one or more of Wings Greatest, All the Best, or Wingspan, you will end up picking a winner. There are and will continue to be those Beatles fans who hate much of McCartney's solo stuff, because it has, to an extent, veered from the days of the Fab Four. I, on the other hand, have, upon reflection, become amazed by how one of the most successful artists of the 1960's could create a totally different sound that would propel him to become a top-selling contemporary act of the 1970's.    Just analyzing other talents from yesterday and today will draw conclusions exemplifying how McCartney's career has flourished for so long. Scores of musicians and songwriters have built strong foundations upon trying to sound like the Beatles, but who would very soon, unlike McCartney, struggle to maintain their height of popularity or go into a positive new direction.     A one-trick pony Sir Paul never was, never is, nor ever will be.

B0007P3582|3.0|50 Cent's career has come a long way since he was left for dead in his former neighborhood in Queens. After being dropped from Columbia, he hit the mixtape circuit with a vengeance and caught the eye of rap's hottest-seller, Eminem, and ended up in a deal with both Em's Shady Records and Dr. Dre's Aftermath. Following the record-breaking success of his debut, \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\", his own G-Unit label found a home on Interscope and he became the new sweetheart of MTV's mostly-white suburban audience. The success has been both a gift and a curse with Fifty's name pushing platinum or better on anything it is attached to but also resulting in him becoming the \\"most hated rapper\\" in the industry, a title that the superstar seems to proudly embrace.<br /><br />Those expecting 50's sophmore release, \\"The Massacre\\" to sound anything like his early \\"Power Of The Dollar\\" days is gonna be in for some dissapoinment. Tracks like \\"In My Hood\\" and \\"Ski Mask Way\\" show the gun-happy 50 gettin his gangsta on but the album lacks a solid formula. 50 has a new audience and as a result, he has an obligation to mix in some dance-friendly party music. TRL-aimed garbage like \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Disco Inferno\\" is sure to push 50 up the pop charts but it will have fans of the violently-witty 50 Cent of past in an uproar. Likewise, \\"Just A Lil Bit\\" is about as simple-minded and boring as it gets. Over a predictable Indian beat by Scott Storch, 'Fif has little time for actual verses as he pretty much just sings the chorus over and over again for about three-quarters of the song.<br /><br />The Massacre's biggest dissapointment is its glimpses of potential that pretty much go unnoticed. \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" is an incredible concept song that seems to get lost in the mix with all of the cheesy dance songs. Likewise, \\"Outta Control\\" has far more crossover appeal than any of the other selected singles. Dr. Dre supplies a banger of a beat and its subject matter could mix well with the TRL crowd without alienating the mixtape audience. The controversial \\"Piggy Bank\\" is a decent if not heavily-overhyped effort. This much-discussed lyrical jab at Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Nas, and Ja Rule was the talk of the town for weeks leading up to the release of \\"The Massacre\\" but for all its controversy, it's no \\"Back Down\\". \\"Hate It Or Love It\\", the hit single from Game's debut, shows up as a bonus track on this album as well but in a remix form. The original duet between 50 and Game would have worked so much better had it appeared exclusively on this album. 50's attempt to position himself as the guest star on Game's LP may have cheapened what could be his best work in awhile. Likewise, the addition of Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, and Tony Yayo on the remix is a bit much. While their verses are up to par, their tone-def renditions of Game's portion of the chorus are just murder on the ears.<br /><br />\\"Massacre\\" has already outsold 50's debut, \\"Get Rich\\" but unfortunately, it seems to prove the theory that style sells more than substance. As an album, it is uneven and its content is all over the place.

Of the best tracks here, \\"It's Only Love\\" with Tina Turner on vocals is a ballsy blast of thunder rock.  \\"Straight from the Heart\\" is a pretty ballad with Bob Clearmountain's production giving a sonic keyboard wash on which Bryan's vocals soar.  \\"Run to You\\" has great energy and that unique churning guitar line, \\"She's got a heart of gold, she'd never let me down, but you're the woman who always turns me on, you keep me coming round.\\"  \\"Cuts Like A Knife\\" still creates a unique sound with its arena rock epic size.  \\"Heat of the Night\\" booms cheerfully, \\"It's up to you, You can run or you can fight.\\"  \\"So Far So Good\\" is a good CD collection of many of Bryan's best tracks from his early years.

B0007RT9LM|3.0|Piper Perabo is an aspiring songwriter who moves to New York City to follow her dreams. Having trouble getting her foot in the door, she ends up working at a wild bar where the female patrons dance around on the bar in wet T-shirts to cheesy cheerleader anthems. John Goodman turns in an enjoyable performance as Perabo's overprotective father. Those expecting an edgier and more adult-oriented version of \\"Coyote Ugly\\" with its new \\"unrated cut\\" may want to save their money. With the exception of an added sex scene involving Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia (Perabo's nude shots were filmed with a \\"double\\"), the movie is still \\"PG-13\\" country. It's the same sexually-suggestive but far from edgy content you'll find in the theatrical cut.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|After hearing several reviews of the film I was relucant to watch. I love the original soundtrack and finally was able to see in Manhattan (although I don't remember it now). I was afraid the movie would ruin my love for the play.  Not a chance.  I ordered it On Demand and figured I had nothing to lose for $4.  I was not disappointed.  I was on the edge of my seat at the end (it's been awhile since I listened to it and couldn't remember what happened).  To see it in the film version, much of the recording made sense.  It explained parts I couldn't fully comprehend from just listening. Have to check the credits to see if anyone did their own singing because at times it looked dubbed, but tolerable.  The Phantom was rather sexy and not grotesque.  The script did stick to original recording.  I believe one review said the songs were different but it was almost verbatum.  Few lines were sort of spoken rather than fully sung but it perfect.  Well done.  Now I will buy the special edition.  Better than Les Mis (I still haven't been able to sit through that entire Liam Neison version).
B0007RT9LW|3.0|In the VHS era, the \\"extended cut\\" was generally reserved for Jim Cameron films like \\"Aliens\\" and \\"T2: Judgment Day\\". They gave movie fans a chance to see elaborate sequences that were often cut due to the overly-long running times of the features. With the introduction of DVD, major studios are cashing in by putting together extended cuts of major blockbusters by throwing in some missing scenes. In some cases, the \\"unrated\\" cut is the version that the director intended to be seen but due to the MPAA giving it an \\"NC-17\\" rating, the studio is forced to hold off until home video in order to show it in its uncut form. Lately though, \\"Unrated\\" is just a new word thrown out to make the new version seem like it's too extreme to be shown in theatres, when it's actually just the same version with scenes included that weren't given a rating by the MPAA.<br /><br />There is no guiltier pleasure than the Jerry Bruckheimer summer blockbuster. It's where music video directors go to cut their teeth in the movie industry and Oscar winners go to get their payday. 2000's remake of \\"Gone In 60 Seconds\\" with Bruckheimer staples Nicolas Cage and Will Patton is the ultimate celebration of all things one should associate with Bruckheimer. It's a big, loud car chase film filled with outrageous stunts, phoned-in performances, cliche characters, bad racial stereotypes, and a whole lot of noise.<br /><br />\\"60 Seconds\\" stars Nicolas Cage as retired car theif, Memphis Raines, who is forced back into the game when a cheesy mobster type (with perhaps the most annoying accent in cinema history) threatens to kill his younger brother if he doesn't steal 50 cars in one night. Along for the ride is Delroy Lindo's veteran police officer who is still stewing over the missed opportunity of arresting Raines in his \\"heyday\\". There's plenty of great actors standing around including Robert Duvall, Angelina Jolie, and the afore-mentioned Patton. There's also hardly a racial sterotype that the movie doesn't throw in. You've got the Asian girl who can't drive, the Mexican car-jackers protecting their turf, and T.J. Cross as the \\"token black guy\\" who knows he's the token black guy and won't shut up about it. Still despite it all, I'd be lying if I said this movie isn't watchable.<br /><br />This extended version is released as the \\"director's cut\\" so one can assume director Dominic Sena put his stamp of approval on this one. You might think that with a luxury like this, he would have included a few more character moments but in fact, the strongest such moment in the theatrical cut, a sequence with Nicolas Cage and Giovani Risbi has actually been removed and replaced with an alternate scene that is far less powerful. For its \\"nine minutes of added footage\\", there are a few subtle differences but nothing worth writing home about. As for its \\"Unrated\\" tag, if this cut were submitted to the MPAA, it would more than likely receive the same PG-13 rating as the theatrical version.

B000000WA4|5.0|I find it disturbing that Nirvana and Kurt Cobain are credited as the \\"saviors\\" of 90's Rock music. They couldn't play live to save their souls-- the true calling card of a bad band. It was the music that was slightly lesser-known than Nirvana that was worthwhile. Case in point with the Pumpkins' MCatIS. There are about 20 amazing songs on this 28-song double album. The only parts where this double-disc set drags is whenever it hits a piano-driven song like \\"Porcelina\\". Other than that, the songs are wonderful. Non-single songs like \\"Love\\", \\"Bodies\\", and \\"We Only Come Out at Night\\" easily trump anything Kurt Cobain wrote... in terms of melody, lyrics, and creativity.   <br /> <br />Buy this baby along with Siamese Dream.

B0001VWP8I|4.0|The first time I could imagine when I heard this record is Anastacia's struggles against her cancer. And that struggles make this album such a masterpiece! Anastacia is right about \\"great song mostly made when the writer was depress, sick, or in the bad situation.\\" This album has solu power that any other album doesn't have. The opening Seasons Change & Left Outside Alone is really rocks and mean to me. All the songs from Time until Welcome to My Truth are really great! But from Pretty Little Dum Dum until the end the soul of the album is down (even Where Do I Belong & Maybe Today also good). After all, I don't guarantee all of Anastacia old fans for this album, because her music color has changed, but for YOU who like a great, deep also easy listening, and soulful, you should & must buy this!!!!!

B000059XXV|1.0|Wow, I just bought this the other day and was appalled at how bad it was. This film along with the dire Batman and Robin shows why a new franchise had to be made. <br />First, Kilmer is rubbish as Batman, and even worse at playing Bruce Wayne. He's wooden, stiff, boring, just utter rubbish. Then Two Face. I dont think this is Tommy Lee Jones fault, but Two Face was a large disappointment. Totally disregarding his back story, his complex charecter and just sanity itself, Two Face just becomes a joke. He just goes on 'Joker' overload, becoming more insane and ridiculous and hammed than Jack Nicholsons Joker himself. Jim Carrey as usual plays Jim Carrey. The Riddler was also a massive disappointment, just looking like a deranged clown obsessed with his idol Bruce Wayne, Carrey totally ruins the Riddler, hes never scary, menacing  or even intelligent at any moment during the film, and the way they treat him at the end is just terrible. I mean melting face??? I am Batman??? Robin is just an annoying, arrogant little turd, Nicole Kidman is mediocre, Alfred is nothing special. The plotholes are gaping, whats left of the plot is unbelievable rubbish. <br />This turgid piece of \\"film-making\\" is nearly on a par with Batman and Robin which is probably the worst film ever, and I was left cold by Joel Schumacher pissing all over Burtons Gotham, and ruining a perfectly good franchise with plotholes, a turgid script, badly thought out charecters, rubbish actors, hammy lines, bad CG, poor action, an appalling plot and bad directing.  <br />This film is awful, dont buy it, it would be better to buy something with a bit more sense and enjoyment, like Scooby Doo 2.
B000000OQF|1.0|Guns N Roses has to be the most overrated band of all time. Welcome to the jungle is the only decent song...But it can't save this album from total Wackness.
B00005JNJT|5.0|There is something which I think most of these reviews do not understand. This isnt the 5th film in the Batman Franchise, this is the 1st film in a whole new franchise. This will redo everything which Burton and Shumacher failed on. The next film in the series will be about the Joker, this will have nothing to do with the Nicholson Joker or even the Burton version, this is getting back to how the films should have been made, more realistic and about Batman not supervillains played by actors who are just playing themselves. Nicholson wasnt playing the Joker he was playing Jack Nicholson, same with Jim Carrey and Arnie. <br />Well to the film itself, it was fantastic. Bale and Nolan have made Batman believable and have made it the best Batfilm yet. Everything is explained well, everyone is well cast and have steered clear from using massive actors and actresses to make the film good. Bale is THE Batman and gives a superb performance, Caine is well cast as Alfred and gives him that toughness which shows how he can be butler to both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Cillian Murphy was perfect as the lunitic Scarecrow, creepy before he had donned the makshift mask. Neeson is also excellent as is Gary Oldman as Sgt Gordon. <br />The back story is great and it shows how Bruce Wayne could become Batman and shows him searching for his path and purpose in life, ironically shown to him by the villains he will try to defeat. Batman's story is well developed without being boring or tedious, the acting is never hammy, and the one liners are handed out sparingly. The makeshift Batmobile is absolutely fantastic and the burning down of the manor shows how Batman can build the Batcave to the standards of the original Batman. There are a few minor problems such as the fast paced action which can be a bit too fast due to the poor editing, and at the end, it seems as if Gordon is being used for comic relief, but the pros outweigh the cons by far. <br />This film was immensely entertaining and I am definately looking forward to the new sequels which will not make the mistakes which the original franchise did. Bring on the Joker.

B000003NA3|5.0|This set may be expensive, but it is worth every penny. Coltrane was at his peak in 1961. Although technically his playing would grow more sophisticated in later years, his level of inventiveness and inspiration are never better than here.    Prepare for many, many surprises. The previously unreleased material is still incredible. So for instance the totally unreleased Miles' Mode from the third night is an unbelieveably inspired piece. Other highlights I enjoyed include the Impressions from the first day (Dolphy is incredible on this track) and India from the fourth day.     Also, listen up for the crowd noises, which are preserved in their entirety. Before the third day's \\"Miles' Mode\\", Dolphy accidentally blows his horn, apparantly thinking Coltrane had given him the signal to begin. And now you can hear what the crowd is saying after the famous version of \\"Chasin' the Trane\\" - someone in the audience laughs and says \\"That was insane!!!\\".    I agree with thw reviewer who said that the final version of Spiritual is almost ruined by the ugly blatting noise of Garvin Bushell's contrabassoon - whether this is a result of inappropriate recording technique I do not know.    By the way, I have been through many articles and reviews describing the content of the discs, and I am amazed nobody has mentioned that the piece dubbed \\"Chasin' Another Trane\\" is actually a carbon-copy of a piece Coltrane recorded the previous year called \\"Blues to You\\". (Check the Atlantic album \\"Coltrane Plays the Blues - the attribution is particularly obvious if you hear the newly released alternate takes). The tune has NOTHING to do with Chasin' the Trane, being quite a different melody. Apparantly Rudy Van Gelder did not notice that the piece was already named!     Likewise the piece known as \\"India\\" is a piece from that same album called \\"Mr Knight\\".    This box set contains only four discs; but please remember that each disc contains about 70 minutes of music - twice the length of an LPalbum from the 1960s. There is no way any jazz fan could be disappointed with this set!!!

B00003CXCT|5.0|<br />The abominable shouting match against this DVD set is proof positive that an inordinate number of bizarre people populate the Internet. When I heard about the problems with the DVD set I held back on buying these movies (besides, I'm not very fond of these movies); but on getting them I am astonished at the heat they have generated. <br /> <br />To a normal movie watcher, one who is not an angry, lonely, borderline sociopath, these disks are very fine. Admittedly, as a fan of movie history I would prefer to have these movies, as any other, in their original form alongside these modified versions. But these movies really do deserve their reputation. I had forgotten what a powerful experience the second movie is, for example. (I still reserve a smirk of disbelief for the borderline-sociopaths mentioned above - surely the movies aren't *quite* good enough to inspire *quite* so much fanaticism?)  <br /> <br />The flaws in the sound are basically not noticeable with the exception of the switched-over rear spearkers, which is an issue everyone with surround sound should consider before getting these discs. As for visuals, the remarkable restoration has given these movies a glow that makes them pleasing to the eye. <br /> <br />The CGI additions are usually amusingly gauche and old-fashioned compared to the original miniature and matte-work, which I suppose shows the immense skill of the original effects artists - many of the most impressive shots *still* seem to be the ones that are twenty years old.  <br /> <br />As for extras, I was particularly fond of the documentary on the final disc, which runs for 2.5 hours. Unlike most such documentaries, this one concentrates pleasingly on the *real* world of Star Wars (as opposed to the non-existent gestalt reality that now forms the hallucinatory habitat of the aforementioned sociopaths) such as the cinematic milieu of the late 1970s.  <br /> <br />It confirms in my mind the fact that Star Wars single-handedly brought toan end the \\"second golden age\\" of Hollywood (c.1967-1977) by ending the reign of the personal auteur-movie and giving birth to the mindless blockbuster - which is an era that still persists, although the commercial decline of cinema may well bring about a third golden age in the near future.    <br /> <br />So watch this, a turning point in cinematic history and a powerful drama, and be overwhelmed by an excellent presentation whose inherent quality is being out-shouted by a few frightening individuals who unfortunately have an immense voice on the Internet.
B000002J2F|5.0|This one's my fave. I jsut can;t get enough of Behind the Lines, Duke's Travels and Duke's End. Cul-De-Sac is also quite the drug. Although the smoother songs go into the more typical 80's ballade style, the big songs totally adjust the intensity and form a perfect balance.<br />The drums on Behind the Lines and Duke's Travels/end are absolutely insane. As a drummer I'm fascinated by anything Phil Collins has touched. Keeping the basic structure neat and simple he simply injects a touch of character to the sound, playing things that are not necessarly impossible to do, but just so well placed it beats any insane pattern another would come up with.<br />PS: For kicks, if you enjoyed this album like I did, I suggest you find the live version of Duke's Travels/End - Sounds like one of those Phial and Chester duos. Absolutely IN-SA-NE.

B00005JNTX|2.0|I have to admit I have never read a Sin City comic, I am a comic book fan but that is one series I've never been all that interested in reading.  When I heard about the movie being made I figured I'd see the movie and if I liked it enough then I would read the comics.  Well, let me say this if the movie is any indication of the comics, then as far as the comics go, no thanks I'll pass.    \\"Sin City\\" follows three different storylines that really don't have much to do with each other.  One storyline focuses on an old near-retirement cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who is trying to save a young woman named Nancy (Jessica Alba), who as an 11 year old he saved from the same man that is trying to rape and kill her now.  The second storyline focuses on Marv (an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke) who after spending the night with a girl who winds up dead the next morning, goes on a rampage to find out who killed her and why.  Third, is the story of Dwight (a very wooden Clive Owen), a shady man with a mysterious past who now spends his time trying to save his new girlfriend from a crooked cop/ex-boyfriend.    All of the storylines work decently on their own, but really don't belong in the same movie together.  Other films have used the format of having separate storylines that intertwine with one another with great success, \\"Traffic\\" would be a prime example, but \\"Sin City\\" is not one of these films.  Supposedly each of the three storylines had much more footage that was filmed and edited down for time constraints.  Now if a director's cut appears and the storylines get fleshed out then maybe this would be a somewhat better movie.  Even if that happens there are still several things wrong with this movie, the script is very clunky and sounds as if it came right off the pages of a comic book.  Some things just sound better when you're reading them in a comic and not using them to tell a story within a movie.  Another problem would be the acting, it was way too wooden from almost every actor.  I presume this is how director's Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller wanted it, though the reason eludes me.    On to some positive notes, there was some humor in the movie that helped lift certain moments in the film.  Another positive for the movie is the special effects, since the movie was filmed entirely in front of a green screen the CGI backgrounds were flawlessly mixed with the actors, unlike the terrible \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" that attempted the same trick.    All gripes aside, \\"Sin City\\" is an alright movie, and I'm sure it stays incredibly faithful to the source material and for that I respect what has been created, but the movie as a whole, just didn't light my fire.  If you are a fan of the Sin City comics then I'm sure you will love this movie, but you will probably be left wanting to see the separate storylines fleshed out a bit more.    \\"Sin City\\" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.
0393307050|4.0|If one reads all the readers reviews for this series it becomes quite clear that Patrick O'Brian is considered as a major talented novelist by his legions of fans. This includes me. <br /> <br />But, there is a great problem within the 20 books concerning the passage of time, which is very difficult to resolve when considering that the 20 volumes be read as one great novel.Although each can be read independently, it is nevertheless true that volume 11 follows volume 10 and preceedes volume 12. The problem begins about the seventh volume when Aubrey and Maturin are captured by the Americans in the year of 1812, escape, have long adventures, and find them selves by volume 16 in the year 1814. O'Brian himself clearly recognized his misuse of time and actually proposed that readers actually consider his stories as several alternate realities. For example, Maturin and Diane Villers have a child Brigid in 1813, but when he returns from the Pacific in 1814, Brigid is ready to go to school, ride her pony and communicate in Irish and English. O'Brian admitted that he should have resolved this problem of compacted time by setting the first books earlier in the 1790's, rather than in 1801. Because he did not do this, the compacted time of the War of 1812 (which affects the majority of the books) is likely to make the readers head explode in trying to make sense of a series of events that makes no sense. Frankly, this distracted from my enjoyment of the entire series, which I dealt with by simply smiling and accepting what O'Brian was telling me at the time.
0201433079|5.0|Many of you who learnt unix in the 90s would have cut your teeth on the first edition of this book. This second edition should be well received. It encapsulates the changes in the unix world since 92. Most importantly, it shows the rise of linux. A rise that is still unabated.<br /><br />Broadly, the structure of this edition matches the first edition. Rago was brought in as co-author after Stevens died in 99, and he has deliberately kept this consistency. I was glad to see that Rago kept the exercises at the end of each chapter. Many computer books seem to dispense with this, which can be a pity for anyone who needs hands on tasks to learn from.<br /><br />The threading chapters are a significant change from the first edition. Not simple reading, but they do reflect powerful ways to possibly optimise your code. The biggest cost for you may be the effort you need to invest in understanding the coding issues in these chapters. Rago's code examples are deliberately short, and necessarily somewhat artificial. But they do demonstrate well the various threading issues.<br /><br />Of course, other chapters have had minimal alterations. How much have terminal I/O or pseudoterminals changed in 10 years? Those chapters may be old friends to you.

B00008CQS0|2.0|I've tried to order the 23-track Good Bye Lenin soundtrack twice now, but Amazon sent me the 18-track (copy-protected) version each time. It's especially frustrating because they have separate pages for each of these two versions. I order it from this page - the one that displays the plain red CD cover and the 23 tracks, but I've had no luck yet. I'll just keep ordering it until they send the right one - and when they do, I'll post that here.     UPDATE: As promised, this is my long-overdue follow-up review, documenting my ultimately failed attempt to get the CD that they show in the photo. Although the CD that they'll ship you isn't exactly the one that's advertised herein (hence, only 2 stars), do consider it for the lovely music that it does, in fact, contain. Not a bad consolation prize, in all.
0812550706|5.0|I'm an avid sci-fi and fantasy reader, and my uncle had given me this book 3 times in a row for my birthday so I felt that I should write it and, well I did. <br /> <br />This book is definitely one, if not the, of the greatest sci-fi's written, as I said in the title. Card weaves a tale both fascinating and well thought out. I have read several of the bad comments that people have written for this and many of the things that they point out are: <br /> <br />-Lack of description <br />-Transitions between 3rd person and 1st person <br />-Projecting images of false humanity onto people in the story <br /> <br />I have read this book 5 times in my 3 years that I have owned it and I can agree, there is a lack of description, but what I think many people fail to see is that this story does not really need the description. The tale more about the workings of the inner mind and relationships between people, not about the color of the walls. <br /> <br />Transitions abetween 3rd and 1st person may be difficult for some people but I find them quite easy to deal with once you understand the concept they are being used in. Card, in this story, always uses 3rd person to describe situations, but then may switch to 1st person to give an incite into what the character is thinking at the time. This is the ONLY use 1st person is used for in the book, to describe what the character is thinking and feeling at the time. <br /> <br />While some of the descriptions of the characters may seem a little too mature for children from 8 to 15 years of age (around there anyways) this is purposefully put into the book. The children in the book are supposed to be geniuses, so of course they are going to be drawn out as more mature. Most people who find this aspect of the book frustrating don't really understand, I think, that these children have an IQ of around 170 and above to even be in the school described. <br /> <br />I find that people who don't thoroughly understand what they are readingusually think of the material as bad or poorly written but this book, it is not possible to see any of this in the story. Overall, even if you don't read sci-fi, you should read this book just for the way Card has people think and interact with their environment. Great read.
B000002JOH|5.0|This Album is one of my favorites. But one thing I can't stand is groups now a days trying to be like Pantera, it don't take alot of talent to SCREAM.  All those Gothic people are pathetic.  WOW, I'm wearing Black, look at me eveyone I'm trying to be different. It makes me sick
0792844890|5.0|This was the first Mel Brooks movie I've ever seen, and it's still my favorite, even though I thought Young Frankenstein was a little bit better.<br /><br />This film actually has a plot.  Planet Spaceball is short on air so it sends out a giant spaceship to steal air from Planet Druidia.  But like the character Yogurt implies in this movie, the main reason this film was made was merchandising.  The picture's name is put on everything.  I always wanted a Spaceballs Flamethrower.<br /><br />This film is loaded with typical Mel Brooks type gags.  If you've seen any of his films, you know what to expect.  Never take them too seriously.  They're fun.<br /><br />By far, my favorite character in this movie is Lord Helment, a shorter, goofier version of Darth Vader.  Watch for the part where Lord Helment gets caught playing with his dolls.  I thought it was pretty funny.  Also, enjoy the \\"Spaceballs: The Movie\\" scene.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|The movie stars Keanu Reeves as a detective that deals with the supernatural who helps a female police officer fight against the forces of evil in order to save her twin sister's soul from the forces of evil. The story is ok but it lacks a bit of originality and some of the acting is not really that good. Keanu Reeves is miscast in his role and a better actor could have done more with it. Rachel Weisz does gives a very dark and wonderful performance that is really more complex than the film itself but the movie is more interested in special effects than to really focus on the other much better actors in the film and that's the movie's biggest mistake right there because the special effects are not that very good to begin with. Djimon Hounsou and Peter Stormare are good as well but they are reduce to a few scenes, which is a shame because both of them have more interesting characters than the main character himself.  <br /> <br />Worth a look for the great performances of Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Peter Stormare but don't hold your breath for anything spectacular other than their efforts.  <br />
B00006AG5N|5.0|Without a doubt, this is the greatest collection of Elvis hits ever.  If you like Elvis, and you don't already have these songs, buy this CD.<br /><br />This collection starts with one of Elvis's early hits, Heartbreak Hotel, moves on to Don't be Cruel, keeps moving on to All Shook Up, then goes on from there.  Towards the end it gets to In the Ghetto, Burnin' Love, and his last hit ever, Way Down.<br /><br />When I got this CD, it came with an insert that told a little bit about each song.  If you're like me and weren't around when Elvis was, it's a good thing to check out, to see what was going on in Elvis's life when he made each of the songs.<br /><br />I have a lot of favorites on this CD, including the rare Wooden Heart.  Most of my favorite Elvis songs though are from his later years, when he became more troubled.  I really like Suspicious Minds.<br /><br />If you've missed out on Elvis, you've missed out on a lot.  Get to know Elvis by checking this CD out.  It's like stepping back in time.  Very enjoyable.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't add much about the series that hasn't already been said in the previous 1382 reviews.  It's fantastic, you should buy it.  <br /> <br />However, I've also seen the movie based on the series at a preview screening.  And I have to say...the movie's wonderful.  If you like the series, you'll like the movie.  It has heart, humor, sadness, and action--lot's of action.  So if you buy the DVD and you love the series, go see the movie.  If enough people see the movie, then Universal will make two more.  They might even bring back the TV series.   <br /> <br />So if you want to see good television, buy the Firefly DVD.  If you want to see a good movie, watch Serenity.  It comes out on September 30, 2005.  Mark your calendar, maybe tape it to your dog.  That way, when you wonder \\"Why is my calendar taped to Prince?\\", you'll remember and go see the movie.
0679720200|5.0|When I first read this book, I hated it.  I was in high school, so I didn't think it was important.  Even though I only read it once, years later I still remember it.<br /><br />I only remember two scenes in particular.  I remember how the main character kills a man for no reason.  He's just standing outside in the sun with a gun and decides to shoot a man he doesn't even know.<br /><br />I also remember when the main character is being interrogated, and the person interrogating him shows him a crucifix, asking him how he can be an atheist and not believe Jesus died for him.<br /><br />The main character seems calm and collected, even until the point of his death.  He's rigid but not passionate in his atheism, and he's almost like a machine.  He's mechanical, with no feeling.  He just goes through the motions.  It seems like he has no regrets over what he has done.  He threw his life away over nothing, but I guess he thought it didn't matter.<br /><br />I think this book shows that anybody, ANYBODY could end up like this guy.  Anyone could just one day shoot someone for no reason.  Anyone is capable of murder.  Pretty dark stuff.  I guess this is what happens when you don't have any feelings.  You become cold.
0613940660|5.0|C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.<br /><br />To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.<br /><br />Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...<br /><br />How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.<br /><br />Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.<br /><br />Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading.being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch.

B000067FP8|4.0|This was one of my favorite movies as a kid.  I think it's a lot better than the first Gremlins actually.  The special effects are improved quite a bit at the very least.  It also has a much more lighthearted tone than the first film.<br /><br />What I like about this film is it's like a violent family film.  It's pretty unique.  Monsters killing tons of people, and then getting melted into goo at the end.  Sounds pretty violent.  Even looks pretty violent.  Still, it has a family film feel to it.  The gremlins do a lot of cheesy comic routines, appropriate for every member of the family.<br /><br />I can't see how the good guys were able to play these role with a straight face, because the gremlins are goofy as heck.  I like the gremlins.  Gizmo is all right too.<br /><br />If you have kids around the age of 12, rent this for them and see what they think of it.
B0002XVQNU|3.0|I, thankfully, was not one of the unfortunate many to see the Theatrical Cut of Daredevil. The numerous bad reviews, luckily, steered me away from, what I've been told my many, is quite train wreck of a film. I had absolutely no interest in it. Fortunately however, Fox Studios were smart enough to release the Director's real Daredevil vision. Originally, I had little interest in this edition as well. DC (Director's Cut) or no DC, Daredevil was just a plain bad movie, I thought. But then, as the weeks passed after its release, and I was barraged with positive remarks and outright raves for the DC, I decided to give it a go. And 2+ hours later, I was certainly glad I did.    But first, before I move onto the more positive points of the movie, let me start with the bad, which is, rather simply, any damned scene with Daredevil in it. This may seem quite odd. How can a movie be successful when it's title character is the largest detriment to the film? I'm not quite sure of it myself.     Affleck just doesn't cut it in costume and during action sequences. The wirework is also quite hokey, the fight choreography is second-rate, and even the cinematography and lighting of the scenes look cheap and B-Movie-ish (in a bad way). All in all, a quite bad addition to any film. Thankfully, Daredevil the film is hardly about Daredevil the man. Rather, it's about a guy called Matt Murdock. And, in this area, the film works splendidly.    We start with My Biggest Complaint AKA Daredevil, but we quickly flash back to Matt as a child, and the events that would lead up to him being given his power and his decision to use it. This part of the film is maybe my favorite. Scott Terra who plays Young Matt is solid in performance, as is David Keith who plays Matt's ex-boxer father Jack. This act of the film is heartfelt and enjoyable, and both Keith and Terra work well together as father and son.    After this good-sized origin, we are flashed forward to Matt Murdock and Daredevil in the present. We get glimpses of Daredevil fighting crime, and Murdock also fighting crime. Albeit as a lie-detecting lawyer instead of a leather-glad demon. While, as I said previously, Daredevil leaves much to be desired, the characterization of Murdock, simply put, it quite excellent. Shame, all of that is, basically, flushed down the train by casting Ben Affleck in the roll. To be kind, all I'll say is, I've never been a fan of Affleck's, and his performance in DD hasn't changed my opinion of him one bit. I WANT to understand Matt, I WANT to like him, and I sort of do, but with Affleck in the roll, the character is hurt greatly. In any case, during this time we're also introduced to the supporting cast. Matt's tubby partner in law Foggy (Jon Favreau), the beautiful (and dangerous) Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), as well as the slightly-pesky New York Post reporter Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano). Garner is forgettable as Elektra (how E ever got a spin-off movie, I'll never know), and her entire subplot as a burgeoning superhero is rather lame and out of place with the rest of the film. Foggy is, well, fun. But, despite having been based on a comic-born character, he just seems to harken back to the comical supporters in other superhero movies such as Knox in Batman or Otis in Superman: The Movie. Urich's roll is strong, but slight. This supporting cast is, sadly, more than a bit weak, and they do hurt the film slightly. As a supporting cast, they hold together pretty well, and, at worst, they're \\"watchable.\\" Affleck however, is a much different story, sadly...    The villains are both introduced rather late. And, sadly, have little screen time. They are Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Bullseye (Colin Ferrell). Duncan does an extremely good job of bring the formidable comic villain of Kingpin to the screen. While the character lacks some of the sophistication of its comic book counterpart, Duncan lifts it above that bit of poor writing, and really makes Kingpin a menacing and enjoyable villain to watch. However, as I said, his screen time is slim, and that damages the development of the character to great extent sadly. Ferrell also does a strong job of bringing his character to the screen. But in a slightly different way. He hams it up. A lot. His walk and movements are greatly exaggerated movements of forced Bravado and Cool. He's trying so hard...and you can tell. But, amazingly, this bit of ridiculousness doesn't hurt the character much, but rather gives him very comic-booky feel. Something that's lacking from most adapted villains. It's not a great show, but it's fun. As with Kingpin though, Bullseye's character development is almost non-existent.    The direction overall, I found to be a bit mediocre. MSJ's vision seems lacking in both cinematographic value and storytelling expertise. Making it bluntly obvious Daredevil is not blockbuster material. But for the small-scale film it is, and as a fair adaptation of its character, Daredevil succeeds rather well.    As stated previously, the fights are all rather unimpressive, the CGI-enhanced areas of the film are all poorly done, as well, and the final \\"showdowns\\" with Bullseye and Kingpin are, at best, hokey. At worst, they're horrible. But, luckily, the film isn't about that. The fights, the villains, or even the supporting cast. It's about Matt Murdock, and his life, his struggle. And in this area, Daredevil shines.    6/10

B00005JNTX|1.0|A star is far too much for this pathetic movie. <br />I wanted to leave after 5 minutes and then i hoped it would finish( it never did). <br />It was like a butcher's stall; this movie is just about people cutting each other apart. Violence is omnipresent and valorised. <br />The roles are stereotyped: all women are whores in sex-gear, and all men are brutal, pitiless drug-addicts that spend their time killing each other. It's not realistic: Dwight jumped from a building and didn't get hurt.  <br />There is no point because the movie is just a massacre so it's not entertaining or interesting.  <br />This movie is only a waste of time and money.

You'll be watching the episodes again and again, begging for more.  It's a good thing Universal's got Serenity coming out in September.

I don't know how I hooked up with this group originally (I think it was off a random music listen off of winamp.com), but I'm glad I did.  It's four women who play string instruments.  They fuse rock and roll with classical, and produce something that's officially labeled as dance music online, but I'm not sure how to label it.  It's all instrumental stuff, and has a nice feel to it.  I can get into it from my rock and roll side, and has nice classical string influences.  I'm really straining to describe this stuff, as I don't quite know how.  I found out about them around May of 2005, and they released a Greatest Hits in July of 2005, so that was a natural pickup.  The band does have a cover of the James Bond theme they do, but it's not on here.  Likewise, one of my favorites I'd heard before I got this CD isn't on here, either (Quixote).<br /><br />The DualDisc stuff on the second side was nice, I'd never seen any music videos or concert footage of theirs, so I liked seeing that.
B00005JNJT|5.0|great cast, cool use of villians and a decent script....don't really agree with having bruce be known to so many as BATMAN (only Alfred knew at \\"the beginning\\"), but it worked in this story....Liam neilson was great!!! his role as a mentor turned villian was done well...the scarecrow was used very well in this story.... only thing=i wish they would STOP putting BATMAN in those awlful rubber suits!!! and the batmobile was way over the top...the hummer/tank was kinda stupid....hope there will be a sequel....let's have Thorn and scar-face as the villians!!!
B0007MVXQG|4.0|Judas Priest is reset to the way they were in 1990 when Painkiller came out.  Rob Halford is back in the band, and while I enjoyed the stuff they did with Tim Owens, he wasn't quite Rob Halford.  In early 2005 Angel of Retribution comes out, and it's a classic return to form for Priest.  This sounds like what would have come after Defenders of the Faith if we could have stopped them making Turbo. :)  Anyway, it's a good mix of the classic Vengeance/British Steel feel of Priest, mixed in with the much harder stuff (like Painkiller) that came afterwards.  A good metal album, lots of solid stuff.  The single Revolution took some flak from \\"Priest purists\\", saying it was too commercial.  Bah - some of their greatest hits are commercial in nature (..Got another thing coming, Living after Midnight).  Everything on the album is listenable, except for one track - the last one.  Lochness.  It's yes, about the Loch Ness Monster, and it's really long, and in my opinion really bad.  I didn't care for that track at all, but fortunately, it's the last one the CD.  The only downside I can think of is there's no \\"killer app\\" track - no track that will stand out as one of the all time Priest classics.  But what is here is good solid metal in the Judas Priest tradition.  The disc is definitely worth a pickup - no doubt about that, especially if you've been a Priest fan in the past.<br /><br />And speaking of \\"CD\\", I bought this as one of those new DualDisc discs.  It's got a \\"CD\\" on one side, and a DVD side on the other.  The DVD side has some footage from a concert they played in 2004, as well as new interviews with the band that were nice, plus the album in 5.1 Surround sound.  The \\"CD\\" side has the album as it would appear on a normal CD.  I say \\"CD\\" side, because technically these dual discs aren't really CD's - it's close, but not quite.  As such, there's some players that won't play it.  The CD drive in my home computer doesn't play it, and the CD player in my truck doesn't - the latter being fairly annoying.  I like the idea from a value added standpoint, but from a personal reality standpoint, it bugs me that I can't play it on two of my CD players.  :(t - the latter being fairly annoying.

0140367357|4.0|This book has always been one of my favorite classics, right up there with the tales of OZ and Pooh. Who of us has'nt ever wished to fly?<br /><br /> What with a new film verison of it now out I felt it was time to re-visit the book.<br /><br />Like so many other stories that get this treatment I feel a movie can not truly copy the rich charm with which this is written.<br /><br />To some it may sound 'dated' but I feel it has that ageless charm of days gone by which reads like a classic story book. Works needn't be up to date to be loved forever...
B000002HK4|5.0|On what is probably the longest playing EP ever, Dream Theater delivers the goods with a 23-minute long progressive metal shred-fest and some live cuts of the best covers you will ever hear.   <br /> <br />This would be the first Dream Theater album with newcomer Derek Sherinian who replaced original keyboard player, Kevin Moore.  Sherinian was most famous for his work as a keyboard player with Alice Cooper - he actually had a cameo appearance in one of the 'Wayne's World' movies, although you will not recognize him with his long hair.  I never really liked Sherinian's playing, and I'm pretty sure he was simply playing parts that were previously written by Moore.  We don't really hear Sherinian's true writing and performing style until the FALLING INTO INFINITY album. <br /> <br />'A Change of Seasons' was a work in progress going all the way back to the early 90's.  Fans who followed the band around in those days, as well as any fans who own older bootlegs can tell you that this song has gone through an evolution of sorts.  Lyrics have changed and instrumental parts have been added and taken out.  I've heard all previous live recordings, and this studio version is still my favorite.  The production is magnificent and the song speaks for itself - it's 23 minutes long and it's a roller-coaster ride of heavy metal and progressive rock, and the listener will never lose interest.  Most notable are Portnoy and Petrucci who I feel shine the most on this release. <br /> <br />As far as the live tracks go, they are simply some of, if not the best covers I've ever heard.  I'm not talking about the choice of songs, simply the quality of the job that was done playing them.  I honestly believe the Led Zeppelin medley was performed much better than Paige/Jones/Bonham ever could have done.  These songs were actually part of a longer concert, which also featured a 'Yes Medley,' 'Tears' by Rush, 'Happiness is a Warm Gun' by The Beatles, and 'Red Hill Mining Town' by U2, just to name a few.  If you can get your hands on the full concert recording, it's definitely worth whatever it costs. <br /> <br />'Perfect Strangers' is a boring song, in my opinion, but the performance was still top-notch, especially Sherinian's keyboard parts.  The big medley was decent as well, especially the Queen, Pink Floyd, and Kansas covers.  This was actually how I got into Kansas.  After hearing part of 'Carry On Wayward Son' on A CHANGE OF SEASONS, I went out and bought my first Kansas album - they would become a band I would grow to love,  and I still listen to today.  This album also helped me get into more Pink Floyd.  At that time I had only owned DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, but the cover of 'In the Flesh?' on this disc got me to go out and buy THE WALL. <br /> <br />The real gem here, in my opinion, is the cover of Elton John's 'Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding.'  I never really liked Elton John, but I always liked the original version of this song.  However, the Dream Theater version just blows it out of the water.  It's a great place to hear LaBrie's potential in a live setting, and the overall energy and tightness of the performance is priceless.  It will leave you air-guitaring the song in front of the mirror! <br /> <br />This album is magnificent, and even if you're not a fan of Dream Theater, it's worth checking out for the covers alone.  This album was a huge influence on my own perspective of music and helped me get into two bands I absolutely worship in Pink Floyd and Kansas.
B000002HPT|1.0|I still don't understand what the band was thinking when they released this piece of trash.  I'm pretty sure they were trying to cater to a more mainstream audience. Why else would they write modern rock garbage like 'You Not Me,' 'Just Let Me Breathe,' and 'Burning My Soul'?  I saw a few shows on the FII tour, and whenever these songs were played, I used the opportunity to use the men's room.  These aren't Dream Theater songs...they're grunge rock acid trips perpetrated by Elektra and producer Kevin Shirley.  I respect the ability of a band's sound to evolve and progress, but if they do it in a poor manner, I'm going to say something. <br /> <br />There are still a few songs I enjoy on this album, but when you put it up against records like IMAGES & WORDS or A CHANGE OF SEASONS, there's simply no comparison.  Perhaps it was the addition of Derek Sherinian or the presence of Kevin Shirley, but we cannot make excuses. <br /> <br />My favorite track is the epic, 'Trial of Tears,' with it's dark atmosphere which reminds me of something they would have recorded on their AWAKE album.  Most notable is the guitar playing of Petrucci which really takes on a kind of 'Allan Holdsworth-esque' style.  The ballads are also worth a 'thumbs-up' - 'Anna Lee' is a beautiful piece both lyrically and musically.  Sherinian's playing sounds good if Dream Theater were a pop band, but his limits are evident with his Elton John style playing.  'Hollow Years' is an amazing acoustic guitar piece with some spanish influence.  The remaining songs such as 'New Millennium,' 'Take Away My Pain,' and 'Lines in the Sand' are decent songs, but they totally lack the instrumental 'edge' that has never been absent in previous Dream Theater recordings.  This is the element that makes this band stand out, and I'm pretty sure it was not the band's idea to change in this manner, considering the nature of the followup, SCENES FROM A MEMORY. <br /> <br />If you want to build up a Dream Theater collection, this should be the last album you purchase.  Don't listen to the other reviewers here - They are suffering from the 'Emperor's New Clothes' syndrome.
B0000931QA|5.0|I remember the first time I ever heard any of this cd. I was a teenager in the 80's. I was just in awe of how complex and amazing this recording is. The talent it took to make such an idea work absolutely amazes me. This is one of the great concept pieces I have ever heard. Tate's voice is perfect with the bands talent. I could not imagine how difficult a concept story is to write. If you want a truely landmark definition of greatness in 1 recording from the 80's then buy this one. you won't be disappointed.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|The best Western series ever made, certainly in the top 10 of all time shows.  Episodes on this DVD:  Shady Deal at Sunny Acres (THE best Maverick - Bret, Bart and Samatha Crawford), Gun-Shy (another great) and Pappy.  <br /> <br />Will more come out?  Who knows.  Could be that Columbia House still owns the shows.  About 10 years ago they released 25 VHS tapes (two shows per tape) on a subscription basis. We can only hope someone will step up to the plate and make more epsiodes available to the public.
B000268QB2|5.0|Firstly this album is superb, but that is not why i have decided to write this. I wish to respond to a few comments made in the other reviews on this site. Someone commented 'Never mind that the 'Coldplay sound' is beginning to face similar criticisms by reputable critics' - who really cares what critics have to say. Critics do not decide what is good and bad, that is decided by the mass public. In a critic's review, i believe they should only be giving the reader a taste of what the album is about and how it came across to them in a more subtle, advisatory way. All too often critics declare comments like what they are saying IS RIGHT - however, that, it is not. Many critics have this overpowering arrogance which comes through in their writing - what they say is NOT gold. We the people decide what is good or not, and in the case given above, if the people like Coldplay (on the whole - they are selling a fair few albums so i guess its fair to say they are) then Coldplay. Musical merits should be given because of the appeal -not whether it is musically superb.  <br /> <br />My only other comment is in response to a number of reviews i have seen, not only on Keane, but on a number of others on this site. People often complain that an the songs on an album all sound the same. Well, clearly they're not the same but yes, quite possibly, they sound similar. They would though, they are the same band with the same style. People buy albums because maybe they hear a single and like it so wish to see whatelse a band have to offer - if they did this and brought an album where each song was utterly different to the one before it is highly unlikely, in my opinion, that they would like the album. I do not think it is reason to comdemn an album because the tracks are similar. If you want different tracks - buy a different album. <br /> <br />But now back to the point,Hopes and Fears is a beautiful album and i thoroughly recommend it to those who like more mellow, soothing, peacefulmusic but an upbeat beat. But do not expect the tracks to be groundbreaking and utterly different to anything you have ever heard before - it is not. That is not to say that they are less beautiful.  <br /> <br />x x x x
B0006L16N8|2.0|People always tell me to listen to Coldplay and claim they're the next big thing. Well, they are certainly popular now, but I can't say that I really enjoy them. Sure, I'm sure they've got talent. But Coldplay just sounds to me as if they're trying too hard to sound like U2. I love U2, but I listen to Coldplay and it sounds a lot like my boys, only without the magic. What's the appeal? By trying too hard to sound like U2, they lose whatever makes U2 enjoyable to listen to in the process, and that's a shame, because I believe Coldplay has a lot of potential.
B00005JMEW|5.0|...it's going to be a bumpy fight! A film that is a high octane, ass kicking, gut wrenching, camp, cute, American/Eastern fusion of glamourous ass whoopings and revenge slaughters. Faint heart never won Fair Lady but Fair Lady rocks here with a blisteringly bitter dialogue and a heart full of hate for her near killers and the killers of her unborn child.<br /><br /> Thurman is raw, upfront and utterly brilliant and the style of the movie is weirdly campsy, cutsey, retro with a big sting in the tale. Totally typical, highly original, blood spattered Tarantino, humour/drama.<br /><br /> Should have been showered in Oscars from a severed artery of Osacar production in downtown Tokyo!
0609610570|3.0|Although I am in admiration of the authors' successes and knowledge, I did not find this audio as helpful as I had hoped. The audio version is very repetitive and was not \\"gripping\\" and I found myself in a \\"been there, heard that\\" mode, even though I have a strong interest in the execution topic. I may be short changing this audio since I just finished Jack Welch's \\"Winning\\" audio and found that much more enjoyable, genuine, and sorry for the wording, \\"gutful\\". This CD audio is okay, but I would go with \\"Winning\\" everytime.
B00082IJ08|1.0|There latest CD dissapointed me in every which way. The hollow melodies and really bland rap songs just don't do it for me, the earlier release was better with some substance, which this CD is more like water with oil in it. I think 2 of the songs are somewhat better, but this album really let me down.
B000005KQT|5.0|For someone on a budget who is interested in the music of this legendary artist, look no further than this single disc album. The sound and track selection here are excellent. Anyone interested in the blues needs to have at least one Little Walter album in their collection and you can't go wrong here. Another option is Chess's \\"The Best Of Little Walter\\" which features only 12  tracks compared to the 20  presented here (personally I give a huge nod to this cd based on track slection, overall sound & price on zShops).   But for those of you who  have a few extra dollars around, I strongly suggest passing on both single disc releases and opt for the 2 disc set \\"Essential Little Walter\\" on the MCA/Chess label. \\"The Essential\\" boasts 46 tracks and is more comprehensive than either single disc release. It may be out-of-print, but well worth the find.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Based on the classic novel by Isaac Asimov, \\"I, Robot\\" is a tasty sci-fi elixir with a nifty whodunit twist.<br /><br />Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a Chicago homicide detective who has always harbored deep suspicions about the servile robots who are fast becoming common household items in the year 2035.  One day, Spooner is called in to investigate the suicide of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the inventor largely responsible for the technology that has gone into the making of these robots.  Almost immediately, Spooner begins to suspect that Lanning's death may not have been a suicide at all but rather a homicide perpetrated by the robots who, though programmed to do no harm to humans, may be evolving to the point where they are becoming sentient beings fully capable of overriding their programming and acting at will.  As this brand new model of robot hits the streets, Spooner becomes something of a modern day Cassandra (or Chicken Little, if you prefer), attempting to convince his skeptical superiors that this seemingly benign army of anthropomorphic mechanisms may actually be a threat to human civilization as we know it.<br /><br />Like virtually all quality science fiction, \\"I, Robot\\" aims its sights at mankind`s propensity for sowing the seeds of its own destruction, in this case by inventing technology that eventually outruns the ability of its creators to control it.  And when it comes to artificial intelligence, in particular, how long, the film asks, will it be before the intelligence becomes real and the creator becomes subservient to that which he has created?<br /><br />\\"I, Robot\\" is a sleek, thought-provoking action film, filled with suspense, drama and mind-boggling plot twists.  On a purely visual level, however, the film is a bit more problematic.  Although the backdrops that work to create the image of a futuristic Chicago are eye-popping and dazzling, some of the computer-generated images, particularly in the action sequences, look a trifle too much like video games to be entirely convincing.  Still, although the movement of the robots isn't as realistic as, perhaps, we would like it to be, the facial expressions are fantastically effective, creating a sense of personality and life behind a façade of cold, synthetic technology.<br /><br />I haven't read the story on which the film is based, so I have no way of knowing how faithful to Asimov's original vision the filmmakers have been.  Be that as it may, for the non-initiates, \\"I, Robot\\" is a solid film that at least does justice to the genre as a whole.look a trifle too much like video games to be entirely convincing.

B000000W5L|5.0|Each song on this record pours out like its the last of a long and exhausting, pitch-perfect set no one expected.  \\"I Just Want To See His Face\\" is a sort of key-note infused in all the rest of this sublime thing.  \\"Exile\\" is the top of the mountain for a strange and mighty band, and it feels like a fantastic accident all the way through.  Start to finish its a transcendent rush of music and is probably the most flesh and pulse three chords can bear. Taken together, and for its purity, it succeeds as art. That's what the fuss is all about.
B00004VWAF|5.0|Prior to this album I had no real experience with jazz or fusion albums. I decided to pick it up based on the samples online and I was blown away when it was the most incredible album I've heard in years. The grooves on it are intoxicating, the sounds are out of this world, and the rhythm never stops. It's an invigorating listen and one you'll want to push play again when it stops. Definately recommended.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|And yet with no crowd I beleive Pink Floyd spent more time pleasing their own ears then if there was a crowd there, which made the music fantastic and out there. \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\"(One of few songs I like better live then studio) live is crazy man, Love the Gilmour vocals at the end. \\"Echoes\\" is breathtaking. To see this band perform live before the Dark Side of the Moon days would be a really awesome treat to the ears. They shined so much in their early years more then The Wall, IMO. What I would give to see \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" live. Probably nothing, but it would be really amazing.<br /><br />This movie gets you in touch with the band and holds some of their best work ever recorded. A must see and hear flick for any Floyd fan. This is rock and roll at it's best! Hell you could just play the dvd as background music with the picture off and just groove to the music. Pink Floyd is beyond amazing. No band compares to their sound. Just imagine the experiance the band had playing in the lost ash covered city of Pompeii.
0553812173|5.0|I won't attempt to cover for this novel's flaws; it has many. It throws alot at you, very quickly, just like many other &quot;epic&quot; fantasy novels/series/trilogies. The writing is a bit rough at times, but never bad. The characters are indeed half-assedly hashed out, mostly because they're only followed to further the plot, in fact, many of the characters you meet in this novel die before the end. That's the idea... why waste time to hash out a character that's going to die?<br />And that's what people don't seem to get about this series in general. They're all written as glimpses of history, showing you pieces of this magnificent world's past. This first book is (brilliantly) designed not only as a hook, but to change the way you think about a fantasy world in general. <br />The gods in these books aren't singular or all-powerful, there are dozens, and all capable of killing each other. An average human could kill a god in these novels, given the right circumstances.<br />This entire series is written to blur the black and whites of fantasy into grey. Everyone that is &quot;good&quot; is not entirely &quot;good&quot;, and vice-versa. There are alot of new ideas in these novels that as you read on you will become more and more accustomed to, and learn to love. Those with a good imagination will undoubtedly appreciate the images conjured of (spoiler) an entire floating city crashing into an ocean, or of a god raising his soul-devouring sword in the middle of a crowded city street and telling everyone to get the hell out of the way. <br />Forgive me, I can't collect my thoughts. I have not read the almighty Martin, as many have raved about, but after reading all 5 books in this series, Erikson is my favourite author, hands down. There are some fantastic events that happen in later books that make you go back and read them all again because everything connects so seamlessly. <br />All the questions you ask in this book are answered in later ones. Heck, what Warrens really are and how they work isn't answered for another 4 books... but by then you will have your own thoughts conjured anyway.<br />Plainly put, you'll either like this book enough to read the second book and subsequently be hooked, or it's imposing and oftentimes overwhelming idea-dropping will scare you off. If you stick with it, you'll be handsomely rewarded. The series could not possibly get worse.<br />Oh, and don't even start people -- Jordan drops ten times more names in a page than gets dropped in this whole book. For those of you who gave up on Jordan around books 5-8, come to Erikson. You won't be disappointed!
B000000W5B|5.0|It is a more mellow album by them with the classic ballad \\"Angie\\" and the beautiful song \\"Winter\\" (Which is my favorite song on the album). This album is under appreciated and should be enjoyed by more, especially by big Stones fans. If you get a chance you should check out Keno's Rolling Stones Website. This album is rated as one of his favorite Stones albums.<br /><br />If you're just getting into them I wouldn't buy this one right away, I would get Let it Bleed or Sticky Fingers first. Either way You should really look into getting Goats Head Soup soon and heres why in my opinion...<br /><br />\\"Dancing With Mr. D\\" starts off the album nicely with a catchy tune.<br />\\"100 Years Ago\\" is a good song that keeps me interested. Then it really starts to get good with<br />\\"Coming Down Again\\" a very nice mellow song with the cool lyric 'Slipped my tongue in someone else's pie'.<br />\\"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo(Heartbreaker)\\" is a great upbeat song of the album with an odd title and some catchy background vocals.<br />\\"Angie\\" is just classic ballad material, when I was first getting into the Stones I started hearing songs here and there, like on the radio and knowing it was the Stones. The first time I realized this was a Stones song I was in my Government class and barely heard the radio the teacher was playing, so I went over to it and sure enough it was Jagger. Soon after I bought the album really liking the song.<br />\\"Silver Train\\" is good, but my least favorite on the album.<br />\\"Hide Your Love\\" is a good song.<br />\\"Winter\\" is a beautiful song like I said before, nice, mellow and moving.<br />\\"Can You Hear the Music\\" contains lots of instruments and it it pretty cool.<br />\\"Star F***er\\" is a cool rocker upbeat controversial song of its time. Listen to the lyrics carefully. The US release is \\"Star Star\\" for some dumb reason.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000244FDW|5.0|Depending on the temperament of the viewer, this version of Pride & Prejudice will either be perfect or somewhat slow and drawn out. Since I can only judge it based on my own character, I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Like other similar BBC adaptations, this miniseries takes its time and explores the dialog and thought processes of the characters and clearly establishes the social conventions of the time and how they influenced the behavior of the characters. In the case of Pride and Prejudice, this is extremely important for the viewer to understand since Mr. Darcy's motivations are rooted in those conventions initially. In fact, the A & E miniseries (which is so often compared to other versions) didn't seem to make this quite as clear as this version.<br /><br />Each of the characters is adequately fleshed out and the relationships slowly developed. The production values are on par with other similar BBC series (such as Jane Eyre) but one doesn't watch these for their lavish eye candy. It's much more like watching a play in 5 installments.<br /><br />If you need a brisk pace in whatever you view and obvious romantic overtures displayed onscreen, you probably won't enjoy this adaptation. If you like to see a story slowly unfold and develop an atsmosphere and are satisfied with subtle romance, you will likely enjoy this very much.
B0009IW88A|5.0|This music is Hans Zimmer at his best. The soundtrack is dark and mysterious but at the same time it is beautiful and full of hope. Other reviewers on this product have complained that it does not have the old batman theme. If you ask me, that song is a piece of trash written for a second rate TV show. This is a masterpiece.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I was surprisingly pleased with this movie. Finally, Batman recovers from what Joel Schumacher did to the character and story! I loved that Gordon is a sergeant and I also liked how it is explained how Batman gets all of his equipment, instead of building everything himself. The Scarecrow character was well done and Liam Neeson was great as usual. In my opinion, the best Batman movie yet. And there is no doubt of a sequel since a \\"Joker\\" card is found as evidence at the end. But why \\"Batman Begins\\"? Why not \\"The Dark Knight,\\" or something with a little more character?
B000A59PMO|5.0|It's a shame that UPN doesn't get enough viewers, because with a gem like Veronica Mars it could be on the top of the ratings. Luckily the show was picked up, and if you haven't seen season one I would highly encourage you to buy this DVD set. This is one of those shows that you can watch over and over again even though you know what's going to happen, and each episode draws you in. It's more addictive than crack dipped in chocolate.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Ok.. I have heard all the classics from Nas, Jay-Z, Pac, Rakim, Dre, ect. Kanye West's \\"The College Dropout\\" is right up there with them. Illmatic was my favorite cd, until I heard this sh*t! The album sorta tells a story an the skits do also. You gotta listen to this hole album at once to really appreciate it... <br /> <br />1. The first track on the cd is the intro. Very funny and a good way to start the album. <br />2. We Don't Care - 5/5 It's my favorite song on the cd. Kanye gives a shout out to the ghetto an everyone workin 9 to 5 who \\"can't shine off $6.55\\" <br />3. A follow up to the intro. It is HILARIOUS!!! My friends and I laughed about this in school all the time! <br />4. All Falls Down - 5/5 \\"We're all self conscience I'm just the first to admit it\\" ..whoa! <br />5. The intro to Spaceship. \\"I'm just not everybody\\" kinda cool. <br />6. Spaceship - 3/5 The first verse is really good but the song just gets boring. <br />7. Jesus Walks - 5/5 \\"They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus. That means guns,sex,lies an video tape, but if I talk about god my record won't get played. Huh?\\" <br />8. Never Let Me Down - 4/5 Jay Z spits two verses but Kanye stars on the track when he raps. The only reason this song isn't 5/5 is  because the guy who starts preeching half way through gets annoying! <br />9. Get Em High - 4/5 Cool song, fast beat, ft. TaLiB KwEli! <br />10. Intro to the New Workout Plan. <br />11. The New Workout Plan - 1/5 Blahhhh GARBAGE! <br />12. Slow Jamz - 4/5 Kanye slows it down with Jamie Foxx an Twista, but this sh*t is played out... <br />13. Breath In Breath Out - 4/5 Luda sucks but Kanye is tight! <br />14. Another Skit... <br />15. School Spirit - 4/5 lyrics are funny. <br />16. \\"Hey Jimmy, where ya goin?\\" \\"I don't know where I'm going, my dad died..\\" lol funny skit. <br />17. Two Words - 5/5 Mos Def, Kanye, an Freeway shout out to Chi! <br />18. Through The Wire - 5/5 Kanye spits this rap with his jaw wired shut. ..enough said <br />19. Family Business - 5/5 my second favorite song <br />20. Last Call - 5/5 tight lyrics, tight beat, even kanye talkin for 10 minutes is tight...  <br /> <br />I got this cd a week after it came out.. I still listen to it now. CLASSIC!!!!!  IT'S THE ROC!
1401307787|5.0|My best friend tends to take life slowly and accept it on its own terms...and that facet of his personality has always driven me crazy! :-)  The words \\"slow\\" and \\"languid\\" could never be applied to my lifestyle.  I have always hurried through life at such a frantic pace...regretting yesterday and dreaming of tomorrow, yet never truly living in the moment. A year ago I happened upon this book, and it has made an enormous impact on my life.  This literary jewel took me to a place I'd never visited before:  the realm of 'moment mindfulness.'  As the author so eloquently writes,<br /><br />The lack of mindfulness \\"...scavenges to fill time, conspires with my mind to keep me unconscious, lulled in a fog of numbness to a certain extent. It has me unavailable to others, missing the play of the light on the table, the smells in the room, the energies of the moment.  Stillness, insight, and wisdom arise only when we can settle into being complete in this moment, without having to seek or hold on to or reject anything.\\"<br /><br />Learning how to immerse myself in this moment, and this moment alone, has been incredibly difficult.  Yet the serenity, peace and soul satisfaction experienced therein are priceless.  The \\"Non-Judging\\" chapter alone is worth the price of the book.  Realizing my propensity to constantly evaluate my experiences and hold them up against expectations and standards that I create, often out of fear, has been tremendously liberating.  I largely thank this book, and my best friend, for that lesson learned.  :-)<br /><br />I enthusiastically recommend this book to everyone.  I find it especially useful to my clients who struggle with childhood abuse issues.  Therapy clients who suffer from bi-polar, COPD or Borderline Personality disorders could also be helped significantly from learning the meditation techniques in this book.<br /><br />We exist as we are, on this plane, in this realm, at this moment in the timeless here and now.  And that is enough....more than enough.than enough.
B00005ATQD|4.0|If Stanley Kubrick took a break from death to read some of the reviews here, I can only hope he'd slip into uncontrollable laughter.  But then he'd have to pause.  \\"Why,\\" I suspect he'd ask, \\"do my films attract such empty barrels?\\"<br /><br />Anyway, I hope I'm not one of them.<br /><br />Eyes Wide Shut, I think, is a deceptively simple meditation on human honesty in the context of our dearest human institution ... marriage.  Of course, much of the dishonesty in relationships centers around sexuality, and the conflict between the sexual roles imposed by the institution itself, and the far less clear lines that exists within each of us.  And so, we round pegs shoved in the square holes of an artificial and ancient institution struggle to be both open and closed to each other.<br /><br />In the marriage at the heart of this film, both husband and wife have their own, hidden fantasies, longings, disappointments, and wishes that don't fit neatly into what is expected of them.  Nicole Kidman's character, in a moment of marijuana induced honesty, admits to having something less than an idealized fidelity to her husband ... that the mere glance of a stranger could destroy it all (and nearly did once).  Of course, Cruise's character has secrets of his own, and Kidman's brutal and devastating disclosure plunges him into fugue state where his own conflicts of role and sexuality surface.  Cruise's journey touches on many areas of the \\"forbidden\\" ... from homosexuality (the taunting of \\"roughs\\" leads him into the hands of a prostitute uncertain whether he belongs there) to a possible dalliance with a patient to a ritualistic orgy.  Of course, much like his wife has owned her hidden side, he must, eventually, own his ... and he does.<br /><br />A central metaphor here is the mask.  And with his mask finally stripped free and sitting on his pillow, Cruise (never before wanting to remove his mask or costume) relents and tells all ... and we can only hope, by that point, that his relationship can survive transformed ... or not.  It depends on who or what you are rooting for, as with any great film.  Their is fodder for both points of view.<br /><br />Eyes Wide Shut is a powerful searchlight into the psychology of sexuality and marriage, into truth and honesty, and into the question of who (and what) we really are.  Don't be put off by the pedantic and lunatic silliness of many of the reviews you'll read.  They're mainly by folks desperate to sound smart, to read more (and sometimes less) into the film than is really there.  Eyes Wide Shut, thankfully, doesn't need their help.hat his relationship can survive transformed ... or not.  It depends on who or what you are rooting for, as with any great film.

B00004U8JV|5.0|I really love this movie. It is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life. I just do not understand why this movie is hated so much, Speilberg did an excelent job directing this motion picture and Jeff Goldblum was great as Ian Malcom and lets not forget the wonderful performances of all the other actors with the characters they played. Also David Koepp did a perfect job with the screenplay. People who think that Jurassic Park III is closer to the book \\"THE LOST WORLD\\" must have been pitched in the head. My fellow reviewers, do not listen to anyone who says it is loosely or not based on the book at all. This movie is based more on Michael Chriton's novel than you may think. In fact, like the first JP movie, it is almost completely based on the book. I have read the novel and it was good, but nowhere near as good as this spectacular movie. Thank you for your time. Maybe after reading my review some people will watch this film again and see that everything about it from the begining on the island to the end in San Diego is absoluteley great. I will say it one last time, I REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL MOVIE, THANK YOU STEVEN SPEILBERG!    P.S. I really hope that Speilberg and Universal will make a Director's Cut DVD of this movie. A widescreen theatrical version with DTS sound and with all the deleted scenes put back in to make the movie better than it is on the current DVD here. I would really pay to have it very much.
1892005034|5.0|Excellent Book!!!...............WOW
B00004U8JU|5.0|This is a grat movie that is a very close adaptation of the book it is based on. Jurasic Park is one of the best movies out there. It is better than the book. I adore this movie but the sequal is ten times better.
B000003TA4|1.0|I was on a desolate train going through Seattle on a rainy morning. I was all depressed. I was surviving my my wits. I had nobody to turn to for help out of my downward spiral. My only friends were an iced Starbuck's double mocha brownie fudge frappacino and this NIRVANA Nevermind CD I had in my $60 discman by mum packed for me an hour before. I wanted to get away-- from family-- from middle school-- from societal rules. NIRVANA was my ticket (along with my train ticket) A dull haze of grey washed over my mind as I sat alone holding onto the trail pole. I think it was pure bliss... the bliss of hearing KURDT. I drifted away. I was a drifter. Drifting aimlessly in the debacle we call the universe. Adrift in a sea of Seattle grey. My eyes were adrift. Eyes Adrift. Perfect... NIRVANA.
B00003CXXS|4.0|This is the third best in the JP series. I only gave this four stars because of a few moments I did not find entertaining. I am hoping that the fourth JP movie will be good.
6302859204|5.0|Excellent movie. A friend recommended this movie to me and I wasn't disappointed.
B000000WG3|5.0|It's really been sad to see the downhill ride Moore's been on since this classic came out in 1987. Never cute enough to make it in the vacuous 80's 'hair metal' scene (Ozzy once aptly said '...he has a face like a welder's bench') where image was more important than 'music, (See 'Whitesnake' and it's barbie dolls for prime example of what was 'cool' at the time), Moore would trade in the monster riffs and killer solos for the 'blues' in 1990, citing  '....no more interest in trying to write hit singles.' as his main reason. Okay, Gary, we'll let you do your 'blues album' to cleanse yourself, but unfortunately, this incredibly boring 'blues phase' has continued for 15 years already, and each album is more watered down than the last. Gary has never been a 'blues' player. His forte is balls to the walls riffs and ripping metal solos. That's his talent. Leave the blues to the real players like Robben Ford. Even Gary's 'fusion' phase with Colosseum 2 was more believable than trying to be a 'blues player'.  <br /> <br />'Wild frontier' has everything of the real Moore essence: crunching riffs, precise solos, great tone, and songwriting that doesn't make you wince, unlike some of his early work from 1983's 'Victims of the future'. Ex: who can forget the classic lyric from 'Murder in the skies': '...The Russians have shot down a plane on its way to Korea...' That was Gary trying laughably to be 'current', and make a 'statement'.    <br /> <br />'Wild frontier' is the pinnacle of his 80's solo career. He was true to his roots, delivered some decent vocals, and the ghost of Thin Lizzy and Ireland is all over this album. The best Thin Lizzy album was 'Black Rose' from 1979, mainly due to Moore's symbiotic relationship with Phil Lynott, and 'Wild frontier', while not in the same class as that album, is at least in the same spirit, and his 'roots' come through on every track.  <br /> <br />Follwing this lp, Moore was forced into trying to write hits, and  hiring hack singers like Sass Jordan to do backing vocals to become more 'radio friendly'. You know it was going downhill just by looking at the cover and liner photos of his follow up lp, 'After the war', which should have been called 'After the hairspray'. What Moore needs now, is to do another album with a really good soul/rock vocalist like Glenn Hughes, and get back on track.

I tried to skip 50 pages and what I thought should taken place didn't happen !!     don't get me wrong but those detailes that I don't need ..        -------------   OK!! I finished it ..   gotta tell ya people .. the last part makes up for the pages I felt bored in ..     A MUST READ BOOK
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|Honestly I don't seem why most people are upset about this double dip. Anchor Bay only released this dvd once, Twice if you count the Limited Tin edition but thats pretty much the same exact dvd. I could understand if Anchor Bay was releasing another army of darkness or the first evil dead because they have close to 7 different releases of each. Besides the cool art work... for the evil dead 2 book of the dead were getting a DiviMax transfer which it really needed anyway. The Current Evil dead 2 dvd is pretty grainy and needs some work. on top of that we are getting more current and better special features as well. So honestly i don't mind shelling out another 30 bucks to see a cult classic in a new transfer. I bought the original evil dead twice on dvd and it was worth the upgrade, this book of the dead should be eveb better!!!!!!!
B000001EAQ|5.0|<br />This is U2s 3rd best album, and definitley their best in modern times. <br /> <br />1. War <br />2. Joshua Tree <br />3. Pop <br />4. Actung Baby <br />5. Zooporopa. <br />
B00003CXA2|5.0|'Forrest Gump' is undeniably a groundbreaking movie, well deserving of its Oscar wins. This is quite possibly one of my favorite movies of all time. And don't even say this film didn't affect you in some way, either, because I KNOW you'd be lying! ha    Forrest, played BRILLIANTLY might I add by one of the most influential actors of our time (HANKS), can be described as gentle, warm and sincere. He, despite his mental incapabilities, is what all of us truly desire to one day become.     In the film, Forrest innocently goes through the majority of the second half of the 20th century and somehow becomes a part of America's most noted events. He goes to war in Vietnam, witnesses the Watergate Scandal, meets several presidents and cultural icons (i.e. Elvis Presley, John Lennon), becomes a shrimp boat captain and pro ping-pong player, and runs across the country for 'no particular reason'. Aside from all of this, there is one thing in his life that he has longed for since childhood. That is Jenny (WRIGHT), who takes a more self-destructive path through life, such as becoming involved with the disco/Studio 54 drug scene of the 70's... which affects her in a tragic way later.     Notable actors in the movie include Sally Field (love her!), who portrayed Forrest's mother brilliantly; Mykelti Williamson aka 'Bubba', Forrest's best friend who planned to be a pioneer in the shrimping business but died in Vietnam; Gary Sinise, or Lt. Dan, who loses his legs in war and eventually becomes Forrest's first mate in the shrimping industry; and, of course, Robin Wright, who captured Jenny beautifully.    Also... the soundtrack and score to this film is amaaaazing. Definitely check that ish out if you're into classic rock or music general.    Ok, I'm definitely rambling now, but if you ever find yourself down... pop this movie in. SERIOUSLY. Although it sounds cheesy and completely pathetic, it truly will lift one's spirits in terms of realizing the simplicity of life and all it has to offer.
B00005RYLE|5.0|Wow, if you get even the slightest sense of nausia at the sight of blood, this is not your movie.  If you are disturbed by bodily dismemberment, than this isn't your movie either.  This movie deserves and NC-17 rating and almost displays a proud attitude about it.  You will be subjected to some creepy stuff also, but this movie is a dark comedy.  Even so, it will still scare you if you're a first time viewer.  When I first saw this I was gripping my seat as hard as my muscles would let me.  From the first act of violence you are thinking \\"I'm screwed!\\" for the entire film.  The only thing I dont' really like is the Cheryl \\"Violated by the Woods\\" scene, it's sort of disturbing, but with more views it's sort of funny.  The DVD is quit alright in my opinion, but I wish they'd release a boxed set with all three films.  The documentary  about fans by Bruce Campbell is very entertaining.  Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent film and a horror classic, but PLEASE don't show this to your kids.  I repeat, this is not a movie for anyone under 14 to see.  So, if you're interested go out and rent this one and pop it into the VCR or DVD player, sit back, relax, and get grossed, and creeped out of your mind.  You'll also have a laugh or three.<br /><br />NOTE: This may be a zombie movie, but fans of the Romero series will have to look for something else as it is not of the same genre in the least, or any other genre for that matter.
B000002H33|5.0|This is one of the greatest CDs ever thought up by man!!!  The people that give it one star probably don't even own this album!!! <br /> <br />I, for one, am sick of people rating genious albums, like Ride the Lightning and Kill 'Em All, with one star, just because they're pissed about today's METALLICA. <br /> <br />Buy this album!!!  Every song leaves you wanting more!!!  I can't think of a reason not to say that this album is FLAWLESS, but I won't.   <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Mediocre Matrix rip off with a twist finds poor Keanu Reeves trying to rip off his own series with a supernatural tale that has one bad clich after the next and doing a really bad job on top of that.. The director barely scrapes by with the bad script that everybody had to work with and the special effects are sub par for a movie of this size. I agree with the majority who wrote that only Rachel Weisz is fine here with a better than this film deserved performance but other than her effort, the movie just is not worth your time.  <br /> <br />Avoid.  <br />
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|A bunch of peeps are saying that this album sucks cuz u can't understand what they are saying. Since when could you understand what system of a down was saying in ANy of their albums... Besides none of their songs ever make sense... the bad thing about system of a down is that they just use words that rhyme their songs don't mean anything... For this album itself its just plain weird. I liked Steal this album! and Toxicity better... (i haven't been able to buy the first one unfortunaly):(
B000066744|5.0|_The Legend of 1900_ is a film I recommend wholeheartedly to anyone. It is a film about friendship, about knowing yourself, about love, and -- above all -- about art. <br /> <br />It is a film that quietly seeps into your soul and remains there, so that (before the DVD was released) I always jumped at the chance to see it whenever it rarely showed up on cable. <br /> <br />It is a film that continues to elicit my emotions. . .ok, often my tears. . .whenever I view it. The soundtrack adds to the emotional evocation, but also underscores the points of the film: that friendship endures, that backgrounds and stereotypes are thin where true and honest character is concerned, that other-oriented love motivates while self-oriented love (true love) can also instruct; and that art -- into which one can become fully emerged (whether that art is musical or has to do with story-telling) is a force that needs an outlet, must have an outlet -- will be shared. . .eventually. <br /> <br />I teach English at the college level, and share this film with both colleagues and students. It is stunning, both artistically and philosophically. It is a film very much worth viewing and discussing <br />
B000002GYR|5.0|I must say, I enjoy his more...bizarre...albums like Swordfishtrombone, Rain Dogs, etc., but this album has something special about it that I find appealing.  It's incredibly mellow and relaxed, and Waits hadn't destroyed his voice yet.  It's beautiful music, and I highly recommend it.
B0007GAERG|1.0|During the early 90's you literally saved the souls of countless boys and girls. Money and success have blinded you now as you seek out a genre' that not only mocks the talent given you but the message you were meant to inspire. This album was tired and old before it even hit the stores. It reeks. Yes, it will be a money maker...but it is awful. Are you happy about that? Where are the inspired lyrics? Where is the inspired vocals? This is trite, mundane and fully entrenched in the stench that mocks your earlier achievements. You have been sinking fast, girl. It is time to re-evaluate the spirituality of your gifts and the amazing things you could be doing without bowing down to the darkness any further. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. And you were massive. You have fallen far...and it is time for you to return to your roots. Inspire us once again!  <br /> <br />Troy <br />passion1@pacbell.net
B00000JCOV|1.0|People that think this cd is worth more than 2 stars are just plain dumb and have no understanding of music in any way. Just look at some of the silly things they say: \\"uw yeah man, slipknot hes deh best drummarh in deh wOrlD!\\" Uhuh, right, and the drummer guy from cryptopsy or death never existed or what?<br /><br />Ah hell, what am I moaning, the perfect review for this album has allready been written, just look at Riv's review
B0000C9V3T|4.0|I really enjoyed the way Tarantino synched up the scored music for both Vol 1 and 2 of Kill Bill.  The two soundtracks are great but there's a lot of chaff mixed in (The RZA's Ode to O'Ren???)  The intro music in the movie when Uma hacks off Sophie's arm in the Inn of BLue Leaves is also missing.<br /><br />But overall the album is good and it's impressive the Tarantino was able to do so well with so many newly-scored songs (\\"Battle without honor or humanity\\" is excellent) along with his usual cadre of old and underappreciated pieces from radio and movies (Zamophir!?  How the hell did he make Zamphir, Master of the Pan Flute, fit so damn nicely into the movie and soundtrack?).<br /><br />Well worth a purchase, along with Vol. 2.<br /><br />Peter Ward
B00005U2LM|3.0|While most criticize this album due to its departure from their typical style, I believe this is a great work. There are many bumpin' good songs, such as Chrome Wheels, Uzi (Pinky Ring), In The Hood, Rules, and One of These Days all have a great beat and great melody. Those are the best party songs on the album, and as such are my favorites. Sure, the lyrics sometimes seem incoherent, but I really admire the creativity. There's nobody else in the game like these guys. Though I'm not big on using obscenities, I still and very impressed at the way these guys can string off line after line of explicit language. It's the kind of stuff that makes people look at me like \\"What the hell?\\" when I roll through my suburban neighborhood blasting this stuff. I love it. The shock value is phenomenal, and the entertainment value is as well. The Wu is the real deal Holyfield of hip hop. None of this mainstream sell-out crap that you hear on the radio all the time from your Nelly's, Fat Joe's and everyone else. Don't buy into people saying this is the Wu's worst album. Sure, it is different from all their other work, but it certainly isn't a bad piece of work. The first half of the disc is totally hott, and the second half I could live without. But those first 6 songs are worth it! Sure those songs are their closest things to mainstream, but they still didn't come that close. This cd has my favorite kind of hip hop, foot stompin, head-noddin songs that sound great permeating the air of a party with rampant under age drinking. If that sounds good to you, then you should certainly buy this disc! If not, STAY AWAY!!!
B000002BQK|4.0|Even until today, alot of Mariahs albums are half good, half not. She always packs alot of decent songs among the few big hits from an album. Not so with \\"Butterfly\\". Not only do we get the new sexier Mariah here, but we get an album that's pretty much filler-free. \\"Honey\\" is as irresistable today as it was in 1997. \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"My All\\" are both wonderful and lyrically deep. I love \\"Fourth Of July\\", and I really love \\"Breakdown\\". Both are so good. Mariah also drops the expected cover, but this one is tops, and \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" truly is beautiful. The \\"Rainbow\\" album is similar to this, and I like it as well, but there's just no beating the music here, and of course Mariahs cover shot.
B0000025RI|5.0|There couldn't be a better title for this album, for it truly is an absolute thriller! I could go on telling you of how it is the biggest selling album of all time, had a record number or top ten singles, how it won more grammies than any other album...the list goes on. However that still doesn't do much to help you know about the album. This album revolutionized music, and music videos. Most of the tracks are uptempo dance songs. \\"Wanna be Startin' Somethin'\\", \\"Baby Be Mine\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", and \\"P.Y.T.\\" all implore you to get to the dance floor. This album is full of upbeat and catchy songs. The only thing the album may be lacking in somewhat is depth. If you are looking for something to rock to then this is it! However, if you are looking for music that is more personal and carries some kind of message, I would direct you away from this particular album and toward Michael's more recent works. I'd like to remind you all the Michael's music videos and performances are as enthralling visually as his songs alone are audibly. Be sure to check out HIStory disc 2 for some of the greatest he has to offer! Looking at the album for what it is, (party music) it is unparalleled. No collection is complete without this monumental record. After listening to this cd, there should be no question why Michael is and forever will be \\"The King of Pop\\".
B000002LOE|4.0|This may not be considered their best album, but I believe it's still their best selling. Partially because of timing, and also because of the inclusion of \\"Losing My Religion\\" I'm sure. Personally, I could not hear that song again for 5 years and it would be fine. \\"Radio Song\\" is a good start, and the only R.E.M. song ever to include rapping. Dated? Maybe. The other oddball here is \\"Shiny Happy People\\", which makes many sick, but I never skip it myself. The remainder of this album is typical R.E.M., and by typical I mean great. Some of my favorite songs ever from them are \\"Near Wild Heaven\\", \\"Texarkana\\", \\"Belong\\", and \\"Me In Honey\\". Overall, I own everything from \\"Murmer\\" to \\"Hi-Fi\\", and find this to be as essential as all the rest. It's hardly their \\"Low\\" point.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|I wasn't there in January of '70 when Simon and Garfunkle released Bridge over Toubled Water. Somewhere in the basement of the house I grew up in, sat this record in a box with others collected by my baby-boomer parents. Ubiquitous yet foreign to my young ears, Bridge conjures a sadness and loss of optimism echoed in today's youth. While wars are fought far ashore for reasons more convoluted and confusing everyday, financial downfall is on everyone's mind and yet people my age glaze over to bland/innocuous CDs from disconnected pop \\"artists\\". <br /> <br />Simon and Garfunkle write catchy tunes; Brittney Spears \\"writes\\" catchy tunes, weren't S&G just pop stooges? No. As Brittney and the like drone on in a narcisistic and trite ode to themselves, I find myself tapping a foot to The Boxer while intense images of heartache and loneliness creep into view. <br /> <br />A note on a personal favorite: The Only Living Boy in New York hits close to home. During a former time living in a large city, surrounded by millions of people with faces constantly crossing my path, I felt at times profoundly alone. I wonder if my generation and my parents could shake hands with the understanding of what it means to desire the comfort of isolation while fearing lonliness at the same time. This record's power lies in its timelessness. Still fresh and introspective 35 years after its release.
0446310786|5.0|The novel \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" has been a bestseller since its debut over 30 years ago. The story is of Atticus, his children, Scout and Jem and the events which occur in their lives over a two year period. It is the story of one mans attempt to free an innocent man from a cage of imprisoment, a brother and sisters coming of age and the unconditional love a parent has for his children. This novel is one of my all time favorites, a timeless classic.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens second homage to a U.S. state (Michigan was first), shows a timeless devotion to craft. Stevens writes with honesty and conviction in homage of Illinois. Moments in history are combined with lyrical anecdotes and blended with rich segments of oral history to immerse the listener. <br /> <br />I must admit, I am still looking for evidence of a previous reviewer's claim that this record contains a subversive message of Christianity. To clarify, I see Christian references, however, within the framework of Stevens' album they appear as glimpses into a macrocosm of social tendencies. Rather than proselytizing, Stevens writes a sincere look at many themes relating to the mid-west.
B000068PQ0|4.0|This was my first Flaming Lips album (I have since purchased The Soft Bulletin as well) and in truth, I was originally expecting something a bit more indie/alternative-sounding, more guitar-oriented. In reality, Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots seems to continue where previous album The Soft Bulletin left off--soundscaping and orchestral electro-pop. Whereas the albums before those (Clouds Taste Metallic being one) have a more neo-psych, guitar-heavy sound. Oops.<br /><br />Anyway, Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots is overproduced to the max, a bit twee (an Asian girl fighting giant pink robots for the future of humanity? Oookkkaaayyy), and frontman Wayne Coyne's voice is eerily similar to Neil Young's except with a Midwest twang and coated in all sorts of electronic effects.<br /><br />Not my usual for sure, but I really like it. A lot.<br /><br />Imagine some surreal combo of Dark Side-era Pink Floyd, Bjork, and The Beatles (at the height of their psychedelic period) with Syd Barret penning the childlike, whimsical lyrics. It's all very bright and happy-sounding, though there's often a bittersweetness there, with Do You Realize? being the prime example (\\"Do you realize/everyone you know someday will die..\\" \\"let them know you realize that life goes fast / it's hard to make the good things last\\"). The music, while full of big studio trickery and production textures, never comes off as pretentious or gimmicky--the content is too heartfelt for that. The bombast simply serves to draw you in more.<br /><br />Every song boasts more hooks than a tackle box. Opener Fight Test is perhaps my favorite, touching on themes of courage and perseverence over a gorgeous melody, while One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21 has a great trip-hop beat and infectious chorus. In The Morning Of The Magicians is another great song, and a subdued followup to the aftermath of the two-part title track (the first half introduces Yoshimi directly and has an acoustic melody put through some neat electronic effects, the second half involves her battling the robots with lots of climactic screaming courtesy of Yoshimi P-we from The Boredoms). Ego Tripping At The Gates Of Hell, Do You Realize?, and All We Have Is Now all touch on the central theme of living for now in an ever-changing world. The album closes with Approaching Pavonis Mons By Balloon, an almost-instrumental (there's some wordless screams buried in the mix) that reminds me a little of Pink Floyd's Great Gig In The Sky, and features some nice horns. A solid conclusion.<br /><br />In short, great pop with beautiful melodies and surprisingly moving lyrics, in the same league as the previous Soft Bulletin. Now I'm off to investigate their earlier albums. I hope they're as good as this.involves her battling the robots with lots of climactic screaming courtesy of Yoshimi P-we from The Boredoms).

B0007GAERG|5.0|Ok, let me start off by saying I have never been a fan of Mariah. I've heard of her, sure, and I've heard that she has a great voice. (GREAT being an understatement.) But I never paid much attention to her, her songs, or her albums. So what drove me to buy this album? Two things: 1) I loved \\"We Belong Together\\" when I heard it, and 2) All the hype, including from neighbors and friends grew to be too much. I decided to check it out for myself. Every single track is very listenable and fully enjoyable; you can listen to this album the whole way through. Not to mention it's perfect for any time, whether dancing or just hanging out. All of the songs are catchy and they range from fun and upbeat to slow and powerful. Rising above it all is the return of THE VOICE, holding notes, going amazingly high, and doing things I didn't think possible for human vocal chords. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" blew me away and I think any music lover would like it just as much as me.

6304698682|4.0|Revelation 6:8 provides a quotation that Megan Wheeler (Sydney Penny) is reading when the Preacher (Clint Eastwood) arrives on his pale horse.  There seems to be an underlying biblical theme to this movie, as a short time before Megan was praying for a miracle to save them all from Coy Lahood (Richard Dysart).  The Preacher's appearance may be a miracle, or it could spell death for them all.<br /><br />\\"Pale Rider\\" is a classic tale of good versus evil, set near the tail end of the old west.  Coy Lahood is a hydraulic miner, which means that he uses water to wash tons of dirt into sluices to find gold, versus less destructive method, such as panning for gold.  Lahood has just about mined all the valleys in the surrounding area, with the exception of Carbon Canyon, where a group of miners have legal claims that they duly filed in Sacramento.  Of course, Lahood wants Carbon Canyon so that he can rip the dirt from the land efficiently to obtain whatever gold there might be.<br /><br />Lahood steadily elevates the pressure on the miners to leave, but the Preacher thwarts Lahood's when he appears just in time to save miner Hull Barret (Michael Moriarty in his pre-\\"Law and Order\\" days) from being thoroughly beaten by Lahood's thugs.  The appearance of the Preacher causes ripples through the mining camp.  The miners gain hope.  Young Megan Wheeler feels the yearnings of womanhood and develops an intense crush on the Preacher.  Megan's mother Sara (Carrie Snodgrass) feels a similar attraction for the charismatic Preacher.  Hull gains a role model who has perseverance and abilities greater than his own.<br /><br />Much of the movie is spent in developing the central characters, most particularly Hull, Sara, Megan, Coy Lahood and his son Josh (Christopher Penn).  What we learn about the Preacher comes from his actions, though we see him with his shirt off at one point and realize that he was severely wounded at one time in his life.<br /><br />Lahood finally becomes so frustrated with removing the miners and the Preacher that he sends for Marshall Stockburn (John Russell) and his deputies.  When Stockburn arrives, he and his men have a confrontation with one of the miners, Spider Conway (Doug McGrath), a confrontation that leaves Conway significantly worse for the encounter.  We now know that Stockburn and his men are ruthless murderers.<br /><br />The question is what is the relationship between Stockburn and the Preacher?  We never learn the details, but we have sufficient evidence to know that a showdown is inevitable.  We also know Clint Eastwood well enough to know that the meeting will likely leave Eastwood as the last man standing.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood filmed this movie darkly and simply, with constant sharp contrasts between dark and light.  It appears that Eastwood was keeping as many things as possible in this movie in terms of good and evil.  There are no grays in this movie.  There are even moments when you think that there may be gray, such as when Club (Richard Kiel) keeps Josh Lahood from killing the Preacher, but we quickly realize that Club did so because he was good.<br /><br />This movie was filmed in Sawtooth Recreation Area in Idaho.  This area is gorgeous and wild, as we can readily see in the movie.  The backdrop could easily be parts of California.  The only problem I had with the location was the changes in the amount of snow that we see from scene to scene.<br /><br />One other thing to notice is the relative weight of Spider Conway's huge gold nugget.  Gold has a density similar to that of lead.  Spider's nugget appeared to be quite large, and thus would weigh a lot.  Spider would not be handling the nugget as portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />This movie won a Young Artist Award for Exceptional Performance by a Young Actress in a Motion Picture for Syndey Penny.  Her performance is excellent and is one of the features of this movie.  The Western Writers of America gave Michael Butler and Dennis Shryack aSpur Award for Best Screenplay.  Clint Eastwood was nominated for a Golden Palm Award at the Cannes Film Festival.<br /><br />The character of the Preacher is much like the Man with No Name of Clint's early films.  The Preacher seems to be a bit more human than the early years of that character, but then again, Clint Eastwood was a lot older in this 1985 movie.  The contrast between good and evil is much clearer in this movie than in the early movies as well.  This movie has a lot going for it, especially Clint Eastwood in his first western since \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales.\\"  This movie deserves to be in your collection of westerns or action films.d Dennis Shryack a Spur Award for Best Screenplay.

0792163710|5.0|A brilliant work of art unrivaled by any other western before or since. I cannot say enough because words are inadeqate to describe what may be the most perfect movie ever made. It's that good and must not be missed. Renting it won't solve the dilema you will have after seeing this masterpiece. You will have to watch it over and over again to discover how much the missed the time before. Maybe after about 50 or so viewings you may only then begin to realise what you have in your hands. Alan Ladd is mesmerizing and unforgettable as the brooding and troubled gunfighter who is running from his past. After him every single role is brilliantly performed.....right down to the kid. But the scene that makes my hair stand up is when Shane wipes out the bar and then spins his gun into his holster. It's.....it's.....I gotta go.....I gotta watch (kid yelling) S-h-a-ne.....c-o-m-e.....b-a-c-k! Buy it today!
B00000K3UR|5.0|Let me start off my review by saying that Adam Sandler is my favorite comedian,and that I have all of Sandler's albums and I have seen and own a lot of his movies. Yes,BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE are both hillarious and classic comedy films-but what is the best movie Adam Sandler has made? In my opinion,that honor goes to BIG DADDY-which not only has everything an Adam Sandler film usually has to it and is,but it also has everything any kind of comedy film needs. Read on for my review of this:    This time,Adam Sandler is Sonny Koufax,a young male living in New York City who has never wanted reponsibility. Koufax works at a toll booth,and his dad,one of the most respected lawyers in Florida,has been,as Koufax puts it,hassling him his whole life to get a job. Koufax is a grown man,so he doesn't exactly have to do what his dad wants him to do now,correct? Correct-but there is a problem. The problem is that his girlfriend,Vanessa,is sick of Sonny being so lazy and is not sure whether or not she should stay with him.Oh no...what is Sonny going to do now?    Sonny is not exactly sure what to do to make Vanessa want to stay with him...but then,something happens that Sonny thinks could help him get Vanessa to stay with him. One morning,a five-year old boy named Julian shows up at his Manhattan apartment after he has been dropped off by an older kid who is probably about fourteen or fifteen years old. After one of Sonny's closest friends,Kevin(Jon Stewart)claims that Julian is not his son,Sonny takes responsibility for Julian-and after he finds out that Vanessa has left him for an older man,funny,sad,and heartwarming events continue on for about an hour or so.    BIG DADDY is one of the best \\"parenting\\" films ever made. Some parents say that they don't want their children watching this film because some of the things they(Adam Sandler and the two twins in this film who played Julian,Cole and Dylan Sprouse)do in this film are stupid--OK,so that may be true,but WHO CARES???!!! It's a film-and it's a hillarious film also. With this film,Adam Sandler brought out the goofy kid he played in BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE and helped make a film that already had a lot going for it really great,really sweet,and really funny.    This film,without question,is a must see film-no matter how old you are.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Can you say: AMAZING?!!!? This must be one of the best SFX movies ever made. It flat out rocks! Sure, some people say the plot is corny, the characters are corny, but, those who say that, I disagree with very, very strongly.<BR>       The movie's pace is good, and the story flows well. The characters: Van Helsing, Dracula, Frankenstein... they're good twists from the originals, and, come to think of it, I like this version of Dracula ten times better than numero uno. Trust me, you will love this movie. So, what are you waiting for? BUY IT! NOW!!!!!
B00005AFMT|2.0|No points for being able to play your instruments. That's your job, it's what you do, it's what you're paid for. It's the default position, you don't get points for being able to play your instruments. You get points for playing your instruments well, yes, you get points for that; but King Crimson play their instruments well in a low-key way, in the kind of way that only a fellow instrumentalist might appreciate, rather than in the awe-inspiring way that Jimi Hendrix could play his guitar well. I cannot play guitar, but Jimi Hendrix's guitar playing impresses me. The people in King Crimson do not impress me.    The album starts off badly, gets better, reminiscent of contemporary Talking Heads and... it's reminiscent of contemporary Talking Heads, that's the truest thing I can think to say about this album. It's as if Talking Heads had given up on writing songs, giving up on being quirky, and had instead studied their instruments for a few years. The end result is a soulless, unengaging, technique-heavy parallel-universe version of Talking Heads. As the other reviews mention, there's a lot of musical talent here, which must have been impressive in 1981 because sequencers and so forth were much less common than they are today. Adrian Belew's guitar effects rack must have been a thing to see. The band sounds polished and professional, like the kind of session musicians that play the music on Playboy's \\"Playmate of the Year\\" DVDs, or on television theme tunes.    \\"Indiscipline\\" is the stand-out track. It has the kind of quiet-then-loud dynamic which was used a lot in grunge songs, and even the guitar sound is grungey; albeit that, as with the rest of the album, Adrian Belew sounds like David Byrne from Talking Heads, both in terms of vocal tone and also because he pretends to be in the grip of mania. Belew is mostly famous for his guitar playing rather than for his singing. The song is ruined by a silly bit where he explains that, whilst under stress, he repeats himself; and he says this several times, because he is *under stress*, do you see? It's like a sixth-form student joke. The best line is in this song, however - \\"I did!\\", just as the guitars go loud again.    \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet\\" sounds like Talking Heads, which I have already said but it's no less true for all that. The truth is relentless and familiar. Deviation from the truth, no matter how exciting or novel, is nonetheless false, always is. A lot of the record has the kind of instrumental jamming whereby you imagine the group nodding their heads and saying \\"whoah!\\" and clapping each other's hands in an orgy of self-congratulation; I have nothing against that, but it would be more polite if they didn't expect members of the public to share in their musical ecstacy. The song ends with a monologue in which Belew explains that he was threatened by some thugs whilst on the streets of New York; it's a shame they didn't shoot him in the hands. That might have forced him to find a new way to communicate, rather than by playing his guitar very quickly in a clever way.    I can't remember anything about \\"Frame by Frame\\" or \\"Matte Kudasai\\", they were tedious. Too many notes. Throughout the record there is a lot of cleverness with out-of-synch, interlocking musical cycles, five-bar loops, piercing guitar sustain and so forth. Sometimes the guitars sound like synthesisers, which again must have been useful in 1981, because synthesisers were more expensive then. Nowadays it seems like misdirected effort. The potentially good \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" is ruined by these flashy guitars; it would have been very impressive, haunting even, without the guitars. I assume with all the talent in the group, they had to play all their instruments all the time, always.    Lots of fretless bass as well, or what sounds like fretless bass. It's hard to play fretless bass, and bassists who can play the fretless bass pride themselves on their ability to play the fretless bass. I hate fretless bass.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I have been seeing a lot of positive reviews for Batman Begins from critics, fans, the genral public, and people on amazon. They are all correct with their positive reviews. Batman Begins is not only the best batman film, it is also one of the best movies i have seen all year, and one of the best comic book movies ever. No joke. This movie is awesome. Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson. All of them were perfect. Kaitie Holmes kinda sucked, but she wasnt in the movie hardly at all. This movie had everything. Drama, suspense, action, comedy. I thought it was going to be decent, but it exceeded my expectations 10 fold. All the reviewers that are giving it a bad review, a la \\"the true reviewer\\" are giving Fantastic 4 more stars than Batman. That is insane. Fantastic 4 blew. See, fantastic cant even compare to Batman Begins, so that shows you that these negative reviewers dont have a clue as to what their talking about. Batman Begins was so much better, and it is right up there with spiderman 2, and x-men
B0000797IO|5.0|I first saw this film because Jake Gylenhaal was becoming more and more popular and i wanted to see all of his films.  I was not expecting a whole lot out of this film but i was shocked when i ended up loving it!  Hardly anyone hs even heard of this film because it was a more independant film which was shown at the Sundance Film Festival, but it deserves recognition.  I would recommend that anyone who enjoys dark and insightful films to see this.  It is a wonderful film with great performances including Jennifer Aniston, Jake Gyllenhaal, John C. Reiley, and Tim Blake Nelson.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
0060234814|5.0|It has been several years since I last read this book.  I recall having to read this book as an assignment in Elementary school.  C.S. Lewis has an amazing ability to bring back childhood memories.    This is an age old struggle of good versus bad. A great buy!
0743201140|3.0|I like this book because it is one of the first books for management that places a value on difference rather than on having all employees fit a cookie-cutter model. This is great for so many of my clients who feel \\"stuck\\" precisely because they don't feel the strengths they have are valued in the workplace.  For example, Renaissance Souls (people with too many interests to pick just one) do not want to climb only one career ladder but would rather use their love of learning to move from one focus area to another. <br /> <br />I was disturbed, however, by the fact that each person who wants to take the inventory test to identify more of their strengths has to buy the book.  When one client got the book from the library, he couldn't take the test because he didn't have his own personal entry number. Another wanted her adult children to take it, but why should she have to buy four copies?
B0007P3582|5.0|50 Cent - The Massacre, definantly one of the most anticipated albums of the year and it doesn't fall short either. <br /> <br />After a shaky intro(which in my oppinion should never been put on) the massacre quickly reclaims it's audience's attention with the powerful oppening track \\"In My Hood\\" which really sets the scene for the album. <br /> <br />The massacre just keeps getting better with tracks like  <br />Piggy Bank <br />Candy Shop(2nd single) <br />The Ski Mask Way <br />Ryder Music <br />Disco Inferno(1st single) <br />Just A Lil' Bit(3rd single) <br />Gunz Come Out <br />Postion Of Power <br />Build You Up <br />Hate It Or Love It(remix) <br /> <br />The Hate It Or Love It remix is one of the best tracks on the album, it is a remix of a single from The Game's album \\"The Documentary\\" and i think it is better because it also features Lloyd Banks, Young Buck & Tony Yayo. <br /> <br />Conclusion: One of the best rappers around at the moment, 50 Cent has continued his \\"winning streak\\" with another great album featuring nice production from Dr.Dre & Eminem, but its not quite as good as Get Rich Or Die Tryin'.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Well after finally ripping this cd and listening through their songs countless times I feel that my money was well spent and worth it. I wish that they would have some songs that sounds like \\"Everlong\\" but looks like I will have to keep waiting. <br /> <br />Anyways to get past the copy protection it is quite simple. When inserting the cd hold down shift and control. I'm not sure exactly which key it is but holding both down does not hurt. <br /> <br />By doing this, the program to install their protection does not come up. Then use a program such as Cdex and rip it.  <br /> <br />And there you go the music is in perfect condition.  <br />(I am not sure if this will work with mp3 as i ripped into ogg. My files turned out perfectly.)
1400032717|5.0|Generally, I'm an escapist reader, focusing on crime and suspense fiction writers who take me into their worlds and far from my own.  Christopher, the protaganist and narrator of \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is presumed to be a high functioning Autistic.  While the title or a brief plot summary might lead one to believe there is some element of escapist crime fiction with the pages, I assure you there is none.  The book is about, among other things, giving you a chance to see through the eyes of a young man who colors the world differently than you do.  Any reference to crime is a plot device to draw you into his world and potentially shift your persepective on your own. <br /> <br />People started recommending this book to me over a year ago.  People kept recommending this book to me because I'm the mother of a gifted and handsome high functioning Autistic so much like Christopher (it turns out) that little stories I might tell about my son's day or a funny conversation we had would lead my listener to say, \\"Have you read that Curious Dog book?  You have to.\\" <br /> <br />Grumble.  I don't like people telling me what to do and I don't like any fiction that includes supposedly Autistic characters because nobody is ever close to correct.  Being Autistic doesn't mean you are mentally retarded, nor that you need to wear a helmet to keep yourself from banging your head against the wall.   It brings challenges but on its best days, it is a true gift.  Understanding my son has opened me up to a view of the world I would be so much poorer without. <br /> <br />I'll save you more feeble attempts on my part to try to explain the wonder of looking at our world from a high functioning Autistic perspective.  You don't need me because: <br /> <br />Mark Haddon got it right. <br /> <br />I read every word of this book in one sitting, unable to move, simply astounded that someone who is not Autistic or hasn't spent the last 13 years connecting with an Autistic child (as I have), got it right.   That Haddon managed to use his protagonist as the *narrator* and ring not one false note ranks him as some sort of empathetic genius, I'd think.  During the NPR interview that finally prompted me to buy this book, the author discussed his intentionally limited research on Autism and minimized the impact of his early work with special needs children on the book.  How Haddon pulled this off, who can say, but the word \\"genius\\" does keep coming back to me. <br /> <br />Tiny flourishes abound, making this compact book dense and rich with detail while still being readable in one sitting. The book, as written by Christopher, has chapters numbered in prime numbers, rather than the normal 1-2-3 order.   What a clever way to express how \\"differently ordered\\" the Autistic view can be, yet completely logical and neatly ordered within its own rules. <br /> <br />Read this book.  In addition to being \\"right\\" (which is more important to me than I daresay you), it is a beautiful piece of literature.  It is funny and sad and loving and tinged with all of the nasty bits that are so true to life.   My world is richer for my son and your world will be richer if you get to know Christopher.  <br /> <br />--------- <br /> <br />Reading \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" makes me wonder how many other remarkably enjoyable books I am missing by sticking too close to my normal, predictable reading fare.  Note to self to start taking book recommendations more quickly.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|This is movie was very average to me, and very overrated. The acting was great, but the problem is, these actors are acting in a film with a bad story. It's not a horrible movie, but it has it's flaws. For example, the ending was not satisfying at all (partly because of who the culprits turned out to be), and there was too many issues left unresolved.<br /><br />I can't give this film less than 3 stars because it wasn't BAD, but then again I can't give it 4 or 5 stars because it wasn't very GOOD. It was simply average.
0060763280|5.0|As a person who's been exploring many self-help avenues, I've been working to undo a lot of my poor past history. This book came to me by way of a dear friend who's beating cancer holistically five years strong and I couldn't thank her enough for telling me about it and encouraging me to get it.  While I just got this book, I cannot put it down. And I will say that already I feel it's lifechanging; in the sense that you can see your learned patterns and what you can do to change them. It promotes self-worth in a tangible, realistic and true-to-life way to apply it. Again, I just began this book, and I will say it's already given me tremendous motivation to continue on my path of betterment; as well as widening my perception of what I can achieve. What more could you ask for?
B00003W8NM|3.0|Alright, well I guess I missed the part where this was supposed to be one of the most amazing movies ever made. Why did people have orgasms over this movie?  This isn't even that bad, and in fact I have nothing negative to say about it, just dumbfounded as to what all the hype is about.<br /><br />I feel like I was the sole person that watched the \\"negative\\" of the film, while everyone else got to see the developed positive. I don't really have anything creative or witty to say here, because again, I don't have any criticisms. So uh, yeah, if you like psychological/thriller/drama type movies, I guess check this out? Don't expect it to be life changing though.
B00027JYLC|5.0|The story isn't much.  Beautiful woman marries a rich man for his money, all the while carrying on with another man behind his back.  The rich man, of course, is the only one blind to the beautiful woman's duplicity, and when he finally finds out there's all heck to pay.<br /><br />  This time around, though, the woman is a towering 5'4\\", the man is a midget and his friends include the Human Torso, the Human Skeleton, and an assortment of microcephali (a.k.a. `pinheads').  Tod Browning's FREAKS (1932) started its career as a critical and box-office disaster, was resurrected in the 1960s and by the 1990s was added to the National Film Registry by the National Film Preservation Board in 1994. Very few movies start out so despised and end up so revered.  But then, FREAKS is like no other movie ever made.<br /><br />  Even today, with my senses dulled beyond repair from years of exposure to outrageous special effects and incredible cgi animation - even though I've seen this movie three or four times over the years - it still seems shocking and unsettling.  The special hour long `making of' special included on the disk, featuring David Skal and a host of circus side-show historians, provides plenty of background on many of the `freaks' in the movie.  Skal also provides a commentary track, in which he discusses the many hurdles FREAKS had to overcome during its troubled early history.  Better yet, he provides the viewer with information on the many deleted and edited scenes.<br /><br />  On one level, FREAKS isn't a very good movie.  Some of the acting is terribly wooden, the A-List original cast (Myrna Loy, Victor McLaglen, Jean Harlow) begged off the project and considering their replacements and the film's short running time of 62 minutes it's obvious that MGM quickly decided that this was a b-picture.  On another level, because it so humanizes those we usually avoid (and thus in a sense deprive of humanity), and because it does so without resorting to optical tricks, FREAKS is a movie like no other, before or since.s a movie like no other, before or since.     <br />

B00005JN2Z|4.0|An ambitious taxi driver (Jamie Foxx) is forced to be the driver for a hit man (Tom cruise) as he travels across LA eliminating his targets.  This film has one giant plot hole-obviously, any real super-assassin would not depend on his ability to control a random cab driver as the key to an important job where precision timing is the key.  But if you can roll with that, you are in for an extremely entertaining ride.  Foxx (the real star of this film) and Cruise do great work and there are many specific character details that bring the story and people to life in a manner that is uncommon in the action genre.  Director Michael Mann and screenwriter Stuart Beattie acquit themselves well.
B00025ETIW|5.0|My Chemical Romance's first album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love was groundbreaking, but I had bought Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge FIRST. Upon my first listening experience of Revenge, I just didn't really \\"get\\" it. But now, after about a half a year, I can tell you that it all does make a lot of sense, musicly and to their story. (and yes, for all you MTV fags, there is a story behind their albums, and it will be a trilogy as of later this year) The main problem with Revenge is that it is just to...upbeat. Bullets was a much edgier album and also better, but I still LOVE Revenge. Every song is good, and when I say every, i mean EVERY. The song I like the least though, is probably I'm Not Okay (I Promise) because of the damn mainstream-ness of it. Not saying that it is bad, just too mainstream. My favorite tracks are You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison, Thank You For The Venom, and the closing track, I Never Told You What I Do For A Living. All in all, just get the damn CD already!! byee <br />~EtHaN <br />also, i love the cover art by Gerard Way, it is great!!
B00005JKES|5.0|Yeah the Australian version of twin peaks season 1 had the 1 1/2 hour pilot episode included. which is good because you really do need it to understand the story fully! <br />It's an awesome show!!
B00006EXL5|5.0|I Brought You My Bullets You Brought Me Your Love is the first, and best, My Chemical Romance album.  Unlike Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, Bullets has more depth and story about it, mixed in with some very emotional tracks.  I like every song on the CD becase of great lyrics and amazing riffs.  The only song I have the slightest doubts about is Drowning Lessons because of its somewhat bland feel.  My favorite song is Demolition Lovers because of the emotion that Gerard Way (singer) put into it.  Fun fact, the drummer of Bullets is different from the drummer of Revenge.  Great album, everybody who likes rock should have this one in their collection!! byee <br />~EtHaN

B0000696ID|5.0|I am with the reviewers who egg the \\"remake\\" of a classic. I saw the added scenes addition on cable and as I watched I realized I was not watching the same movie. Segments not in the original drag the movies pace down without adding much. In fact, some of these new scenes steal the mystery of the little guy and his relationship to a world which he finds himself lost in. Use the new release as a frizby. And to you tortured artists--DONT MESS WITH A CLASSIC!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Is this the most extreme voluntary physical transformation in the history of cinema?  It has to be.  When we think of actors altering their bodies, especially weight-wise, we think of De Niro, Hanks, maybe Carrey and that gal who played the fat British chick.  I almost don't want to overstress it, because the film is so well done in general.  But people go on and on about Raging Bull, that for historical reasons I think it's necessary.  The guy's got his sh-- together and all that's left is the art and performance in its purest form.<br /><br />I also really took to Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance as the good hearted prostitute.  Very well cast from a standpoint of beauty (can you believe she's in her 40's? doesn't look a day over 30) and compassion in her eyes for her \\"john\\".  It doesn't play out cliched at all in their scenes.  Moment to moment I really had no idea what the next scene would bring and was continuously surprised with the dialogue, the acting, not just in their scenes but throughout the film.  Very special piece of film making with depth and staying power.  I agree with the reviews before; this has the ability to be a classic, cult or otherwise.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a unique comedy.  Unlike most comedies, which adhere closely to the conventions of one particular comedic style, Grail is an absurd farce.  From the opening scene, in which a castle guard demands to know why King Arthur is using coconuts to simulate a horse, and then belittles his analogy to bird migration, the film constantly seeks to surprise its audience and keep us off-balance.  King Arthur is never allowed to become an heroic figure since almost no one respects his authority, and the Knights are variously too bloodthirsty or too cowardly.  The world they inhabit, of lustful maidens, killer rabbits and vindictive enchanters, hilariously parodies the Arthurian legend.  Followers of the Lord of the Rings films will be amused by its twisted take on mythology.  Imagine Frodo trying to answer the questions at the Bridge of Death!
B000003TBP|4.0|Well, what can you say about this album?  It is possibly the quintessential Beck album.  Typically strange lyrics, with imaginative instrumentation and samples.  [[ASIN:B000003TB2 Mellow Gold]] had his biggest hit, \\"Loser\\", but this album is more cohesive than that one.  If you want to experience Beck, this would be a good album to start with.
078322799X|5.0|In the early 1960's, a serial killer named Johnny Charles Bartlett (played BRILLIANTLY by Jake Busey) scores himself a record of killings (\\"That's one more than Starkweather!\\", he brags), with the help of his teenage girlfriend Patricia Ann Bradley (played by Dee Wallace-Stone). Twenty-something years later, Dr. Lucy Lynskey pays a visit to Patricia, in order to doctor some of her wounds. Patricia tells Lucy about her past, and why she has to keep Johnny's ashes in her room. Patricia's mother snaps at Lucy, making her leave. Psychic-investigator Frank Bannister (played wonderfully by Michael J. Fox), who can see deceased souls thanks to a accident he was in 5 years ago that killed his wife, by the help of his ghostly friends, Cyrus (Chi McBride) and Stuart (Jim Fyfe), and an undead judge (John Astin), earns a living working cases that involve objects moving around the room, toilet seats banging, water faucets turning on and off, etc. One day, Bannister acidentally scatters his business cards all over the car, and winds up crashing into a fence. He meets the owner, Ray Lynskey, who is angry at what has happened. He makes an offer to pay for the fence while giving Ray his business card. Later on, Bannister's friendly ghosts decide to frighten Ray, and his wife Lucy. Lucy decides to call Frank over, and Frank does a fake test, scoring himself another paycheck. Bannister and his friends quit fooling people when he starts noticing real hauntings around town: citizens dying mysteriously. Frank can see a figure, who looks like the grim reaper, crushing hearts of certain citizens, and then places a number on their foreheads. Lucy becomes one of the unlucky victims of one of the killings. She believes Frank has psychic abilities when her husband (who is now deceased) questions Frank about what happend to him. Ray asks Frank to invite Lucy to dinner, in order to be able to speak to her. Lucy joins Bannister in order to get to the bottom of what's happening. However, all of the killings point to Bannister, but Bannister soon figures out that Johnny Bartlett is \\"alive\\". Enter in FBI agent Investigator Dammers (played by Jeffrey Combs), a paranoid man who gets \\"all of the fruity cases\\". He takes Bannister in, and while Lucy is trying to help Bannister escape, Dammers tells her about the accident involving Bannister and his beautiful wife. While Dammers and Patricia try to stop Frank and Lucy, it's up to Frank, Lucy, and his dead friends to take down Johnny.e killings point to Bannister, but Bannister soon figures out that Johnny Bartlett is \\"alive\\".

B000002U9W|5.0|The first song Atom Heart Mother, is divided into several parts much like Shine on you Crazy Diamond. Except it's far more orchestrated as opposed to more keyboard. The song overall is excellent. Then there is songs that the band members wrote for the middle. If, which is Waters second song discussing insanity, which became his thing to write about later on. Fat Old Sun an excellent song by Gilmour with what I would consider his first real guitar solo at the end. Then the implant of human sounds in Alan's Psychadelic Breakfast. The final bridge to cross into their work that marked Floyd as Floyd.

B000002C1W|5.0|A Momentary Lapse Of Reason sounds a lot like a David Gilmour solo recording than a Pink Floyd one. This is similar to what Roger Waters did with The Wall, except that the other members actually had input.

B0000640VO|4.0|Amelie had never really appealed to me before now. My dad bought it a while ago, and has been hassling me to watch it. It's only when I decided that I had to have A Very Long Engagement (by the same director, and also starring Audrey Tatou), that I decided I had to check this one out first.<br /><br />Audrey Tatou is simply wonderful, and a joy to watch. I wasn't keen on the hairstyle, although it highlighted her perfect cheekbones. She was full of expressions, and even the simplest widening of her eyes, or something similar was wonderful.<br /><br />The film was also full of the most unique characters I've seen in a long time, and they steal the show out from under Audrey's feet. I particularly liked the old guy who painted. He was spying on Amelie & she was spying on him at the same time! The film is almost entirely focused on the title character, a loner in life, who found sex unenjoyable (what?!), and entertains herself by helping others. The subtitles aren't offputting at all, which can sometimes be found in films. You do however wish you were fluent in French, it can make it so much easier! There's actually a guy in this film, who has a hobby of collecting the torn up photos from photo booths, and piecing them back together. And then keeping them all in an album. Audrey finds this album, and then discovers there's always a reacurring face amongst them. Who is he? Watch the film & find out.<br /><br />The film can come across as quite childish, but there's also a lot of mentions of sex. Amelie sitting on top of a roof, wondering how many people out there are having orgasms, the striptease, the couple getting it on in the cafe, and the adult shop.<br /><br />There's a couple of really funny scenes, but the one that's really memorable for me, is the scene with the blind guy. Amelie spots him trying to cross the road, takes his arm, and promptly takes him across the road, and further on, describing everything around them, before leaving him at the station. She probably took him ages out his way, but that's never mentioned.<br /><br />Movies like this one don't come along very often, and I urge you to go and see it - and then go see A Very Long Engagement, which I'm dying to get on DVD! However, I fear it's a film you'll love or hate, but give it a try. You have to try everything once.She probably took him ages out his way, but that's never mentioned. <br /> <br />Movies like this one don't come along very often, and I urge you to go and see it - and then go see A Very Long Engagement, which I'm dying to get on DVD!

B000002J2B|4.0|Released in December, 1976, it reached #26 on the 1977 Pop Album chart, as Genesis was increasing in popularity. It has the same bandmember lineup as its companion album, Trick of the Tail, which was released about a year earlier. Phil Collins had taken over the lead vocals after Peter Gabriel's departure, and Steve Hackett was still present on Wind & Wuthering, his last contribution to a Genesis studio album. Overall, Wind & Wuthering is somewhat spotty compared to Trick of the Tail and earlier Genesis albums, though it has a few of my favorite Genesis songs, \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\", \\"Blood On The Rooftops\\", and \\"...Quiet Earth\\".<br /><br />The songs:<br />\\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\" has folktale lyrics, similar to their early 70s albums, concerning a Scottish earl who's let down by his father in battle. It's an upbeat song, and was played live in concert during the late 70s. It has a classical guitar interlude by Steve Hackett, and was one of the last progressive songs released by Genesis.<br />\\"One For The Vine\\" written by Tony Banks, features his keyboards, and tells of an unwilling messiah who feels compelled to lead a rebellion. This was another song they played in concert at the time.<br />\\"Your Own Special Way\\" reached #62 on the 1977 Pop Singles chart, and is an okay pop song, but lacking any progressive elements.<br />\\"Wot Gorilla?\\" is an okay instrumental, basically filler.<br />\\"All In A Mouse's Night\\" - a relatively unknown sleeper written by Tony Banks.<br />\\"Blood On The Rooftops\\" - cowritten by Steve Hackett, it begins with a classical guitar intro. It tells of one man's advice to skip the TV news/programs because of the violence (hence the title, referring to rooftop TV antennae).<br />\\"Unquiet Slumbers.../...Quiet Earth/Afterglow\\" -  \\"...Quiet Earth\\" is an instrumental song with energetic drumming, which segues into \\"Afterglow\\".
B000040OBS|4.0|I wasn't expecting much when I first read about Suicide, one guy with a guitar and another with a keyboard making noise. The sound itself is very primitive but there's some neat effects thrown in the mix, I couldnt really make out the guitar also. As for the songs themself, they range from atomspheric to just plain disturbing and offensive. Frankie Teardrop blew me away when I first heard it, the freaky lyrics about Frankie losing is mind both in reality and hell is effectively shocking, especially the lead screaming over the noise. Unlike throbbing gristle or any else of the exprimental noise acts around in that time, Suicide posses more of a nilistic feel (must be why people mis-label this music as punk). But keep in mind, the music itself is very simple and primitive, but I don't get how they were not using other synths in the recordings like the Cheree remix which sounds like deranged ambient stuff. <br /> <br />If yer interested in early synth stuff like throbbing then give this a shot, very harsh stuff but interesting to hear.
B00003CX5P|4.0|When most fans watched with great anticipation,  1999's \\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\\", they fully were aware they were watching the first of a \\"prequel\\" trilogy to the widely successful \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy that was made between 1977 and 1983.   For those familiar with the original trilogy, it is going to be almost impossible not to watch the prequel trilogy and begin to try to piece together how things will eventually evolve into the original trilogy.   I've tried to make an attempt to watch \\"Episode I\\" and see how the movie stands on its own - without knowing the story of the latter movies.  This was not as easy to do it seems - and much of what is done in this movie will really only make sense in the big scheme of the entire Star Wars story.   However, as difficult as it is to view this objectively - it turns out that this really is a pretty good movie no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br />For those familiar with the Star Wars trilogy, this movie is the first of the prequel to the original Star Wars that follows the story of Luke Skywalker's father Anakin - from boyhood to his turn to the \\"dark side\\" of the force.   When I watched this movie, I tried to erase any preconceived notions of knowing there was a Luke Skywalker - this was difficult, but it does make things interesting.   The storyline is this: There is a group of planets that are loosely governed into a government known as \\"The Republic\\".    A taxation policy of trade routes has led to a dispute between the Planet Naboo and a Trade Federation organization.  Two Jedi Knights have been dispatched by the Republic's Chancellor to act as ambassadors to try to resolve the dispute - these are the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (played by Liam Neeson) and his apprentice, a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (played by Ewan McGregor).   Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord who is behind the Trade Federation is very upset by the Jedis getting involved.  When Naboo's Queen Amidala (played by Natalie Portman) is captured by the Trade Federation, it is Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan who rescue her.   Pursued by the Trade Federation, the Jedis have damage to their ship and are forced to land on the desert planet of Tatooine.  It is on Tatooine that they meet a brilliant slave boy - Anakin Skywalker (played by Jake Lloyd).   Qui-Gon immediately takes a liking to Anakin and feels he may be \\"a chosen one\\" for the Jedis.  When Qui-Gon can't get the parts he needs for the ship's repairs, it is Anakin who plays a key role in helping them get these parts.   Meanwhile, Sidious has dispatched his apprentice Darth Maul to go after the Jedis.  One the ship's repairs are made, the focus on the movie switches two fold: 1) The Jedis work with Queen Amidala to help liberate Naboo from the oppression of the Trade Federation; 2) Qui-Gon works with the Jedi Council to convince them to let him train the boy as a Jed while trying to figure out who Darth Maul is.  The battle on Naboo and the showdown between Darth Maul against Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan will highlight the movie's climax.    <br /> <br />The role of Anakin Skywalker is significant.  If you know the Star Wars story, these quotes will make sense.   If you aren't - these quotes will help add to the intrigue of what will come in subsquent \\"episodes\\". <br /> <br />Anakin's Mother: \\"He was meant to help you\\"; \\"There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him. I can't explain what happened.\\" (a quote that has lead to obvious and justified criticism from Christians) <br />Qui-Gon: \\"Something about this boy\\" <br />Senator Palpatine: \\"We will watch your career with great interest\\" (referring to Anakin) <br />Yoda: \\"Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.\\" (again referring to Anakin) <br /> <br />One thing I didn't like was that there seemed to be a lack of character development on the part of Obi-Wan Kenobi.   In fact, really for a good chunk of the movie - it is fair tosay that Obi-Wan is a minor character.  He was relegated to staying behind with the ship on Tatooine while Qui-Gon was with Anakin trying to get the parts to repair the ship.  But it seems like \\"all of the sudden\\" things are rushed toward the end with making Obi-Wan the \\"hero\\". <br /> <br />The one thing that is difficult to follow with this movie - whether you know the original Star Wars story or not is that the politics of this movie are extremely difficult to follow.  Understanding what the roles of the Republic, Trade Federation, Chancellors, Jedi Knights, and even the Sith Lords are pretty confusing throughout the movie - especially the politics of the Republic and Trade Federation.   I found if this could have been simplified - I think this would have made for a much more enjoyable movie.  <br /> <br />The character of Jar-Jar Binks took a lot of criticism - and fairly so.  Jar-Jar is someone who saves Qui-Gon's life on Naboo and eventually joins him.   Unfortunately, his role is basically more of a comic role.  I have always felt that Anthony Daniels' C3PO role has done a better job at comic relief.  Jar-Jar's role - although key when the Battle of Naboo takes place, seemed to be unnecessary in terms of this comic role.   On a side note, we are told of the origins of the droids C3P0 and R2D2 in this movie. <br /> <br />Despite the shortcomings I mention above.  I still enjoyed this movie.  This movie did entertain me - and it won't disappoint in terms of action and special effects.   I'd recommend it - and I'd recommend to try to watch it by blocking out what you know of the original trilogy - it will give it a new twist.  <br />
B0002OERI0|2.0|I don't know how well you know 80s hair metal, or if you've ever heard of the Runaways, but when their guitarist Lita Ford went solo she released a self-titled album which featured a song called \\"Broken Dreams\\" which is probably where these sad sad guys go the idea for that song \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams.\\"  It's a shame to see these fellows create such a horrible rip-off stinking pop throw-up.  They sound much better when they aren't trying to get all political on everyone, maybe you remember a song a song they also stole entilted \\"Knowledge,\\" which included the lyrics \\"all I know is that I don't know nothing.\\"  Please Green Day, return to the immature true punk fashion of old and not this garbage.

0393317552|4.0|I just want to point out that some of the reviewers on Amazon who gave this book very low reviews don't seem to have actually read it.  To use an example, one guy says, \\"he doesn't explain why north america, with its great farmland, didn't develop super crops!\\"  What?  There's a qhole stinking chapter devoted to that question!  Oy.  Read the book, people, THEN write the review.  If you still don't agree, counter the argument that's actually in the book!<br /><br />The pros of the book far outweigh its cons, especially in terms of the thorough history of writing (which I greatly enjoyed) as well as the chapters on plant and animal domestication.<br /><br />But negatives there are.  I feel he is overzealous (he's demolishing a racist view of history that's been out of vogue for decades) and sometimes condescending and repetitive in his writing style.  Some parts are a pleasure to read, other parts are tiresome, and there is a distinct 'PC' feel to the book, especially when he offers the questionable thesis in the beginning that New Guineans are smarter, on average, than the people reading his book.  In general, it's when he goes off on these random tangents that the book loses its appeal and you end up rolling your eyes.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I saw this movie on the cruise i went on and it was fantastic and the way Howard Hughes survived from that plane accident he was a survivor even though he died in his 60s which is young.HE was also brave because he would never cry of big pain, it seems like he is the best Aviator in the world because how good of an pilot he was.Also when he was working on the movie Hell's Angels he would be very strict to be a good director
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Long gone from the days of 6:00 or New Millenium, Dream Theater is venturing into a new world of heavy riffs and experimentation. Dream Theater has definetly tried some different things out with Octavarium, the most obvious in \\"I Walk Beside You.\\" <br /> <br />1. The Root of All Evil - A great DT track. It's The Glass Prison pt. 3 and the lyrics have the same dark overtone that is present in the other two parts. It has a great beginning with the dark piano, and then later evolves into a fast-moving song. Great solos, great riffs, great lyrics. Definetly a song to listen to. <br /> <br />2. The Answer Lies Within - Sadly, this is the one DT track I skip. I find it a little too slow for me (and it's not like I skip any song that's below 100 BPM or anything like that). Oh well, give the song a try and maybe it'll work on you. <br /> <br />3. These Walls - Awesome track. It's a relatively slow, sad song with a cool keyboard riff. Petrucci's solo later on is quite nice too. <br /> <br />4. I Walk Beside You - If you have never heard of DT you might even mistake this song for U2. The U2 influence controls so much of this song. Still, I enjoy listening to it because it has this \\"story-telling\\" feel to it. But if you're a hardcore DT fan and won't tolerate any influencial nonsense on this album, skip this track. <br /> <br />5. Panic Attack - My favorite track. Heavy bass intro followed by heavy riffs. The drums are nice to listen to and the guitar is sweet too. The solo section is mediocore but the rest of the song is great. If you can handle this dark shade of DT you'll like this track. <br /> <br />6. Never Enough - The awesome guitar riff that plays at the beginning, middle, and end of the song is definetly one I rewind a few times. The lyrics are interesting and the music has a dark, heavy, evil feel. I really like the solo section of this song. <br /> <br />7. Sacrificed Sons - An epic song that talks about 9/11 and the war in Iraq without actually saying \\"9/11\\" or \\"Iraq\\". Starts off slow, picks up speed, and by the solo section has a great rhythm and great riffs. Certainly one to listen to. <br /> <br />8. Octavarium - And at last the title track. The song starts off very slowly with an \\"out-of-this-world\\" feel. By the time James LaBrie starts singing the song has picked up tempo and features some drumming. After some words by James, there is a transition and a really cool bassline kicks in and the song truly gets going. I've rewound that part time and time again. After that there are some solos, an evil-sounding part, and then back to the beginning. Overall, this is an epic song. Listen to this in the car on a couple-hour ride somewhere to truly appreciate it. <br /> <br />I gave this album 4 out of 5 stars because I feel it's strayed too far from the good ol' days of Under a Glass Moon, Just Let Me Breathe, Metropolis, and other well-known DT songs. There's lots of influence in this album and I prefered the true DT stuff. Also, the drums are rather simple in this album. No Dance of Eternity-style drums anymore. Sad. But otherwise, this is a great album. Go buy it! It's DT!!
B0002S94OS|5.0|this album is so crazy. ive been listening to this album since i got it and havent gotten sick of it. i wish there were more guitar solos. mark and willie rip so hard they should change the bands name to lamb chops. chris is an amazing drummer, he doesnt just bash the set like some drummers today. randys voice has clarified so much since new american gospel. i love lamb of god. cant wait for the next album.
B00097A5I6|4.0|As my title says, this album is a great comeback for Oasis. The songs on the album show their true potential of being very talented musicians/songwriters (Gallaghers). In tracks like Let There Be Love, Guess God Thinks I'm Abel and Love Like A Bomb, you can almost hear Lennon's voice being heard through the music. The craftsmanship of the lyrics and general organization of the entire catalogue has been improved since such albums as Be Here Now and Heathen Chemistry. A very good comeback album for Oasis, not too mention a good comeback for the ever successful British Invasion!
0156027321|4.0|My sister with impecable taste in reading material loaned this to my Wife.  I got to it first.  That is to say, I couldn't find a book I was looking for, and this one was sitting on the desk.  I scanned the back, and took a look.  I devoured the book in two 3-hour sittings.<br /><br />As a Buddhist (Soto Zen) and a Christian (Anglican; my Priest calls me a Buddheo-Christian)I have grown accustomed to people that don't truly understand either path telling me that the arrangement is simply not \\"possible\\".  I honestly felt like answering out loud when the holy men were telling Pi \\"You can't follow more than one religion!\\"  In my heart I wanted Pi to use the words I've used so often in my life \\"No, YOU can't follow more than one religion. God and I, however have no problem with it.\\"<br /><br />I must say that, while I've not heard much mention of it, Martel's wit is the gem that kept me captivated.  I found myself laughing out loud for much of the first half of the book.  Some points actually so funny that I would wake my wonderful, patient wife with my guffaws.  = )<br /><br />The ending was abrupt, and not as satisfying as I would like, but that is simply my opinion.  My sister thought it was perfect.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Poignant, powerful, shocking, sexy, sad. Closer is a microscopic view of what is going on in human relationships today. The whole question of \\"relating\\" is brought into sharp focus as we see four single people in search of love, yet not knowing how to find it. And when they do find it, not knowing what to do with it. Lying, deception, and more lying fills this very void in the mating dance today. An accurate analysis of relationships in a world that teaches us to be ever selfish, teaches us to be distant, teaches us how to be just \\"close enough\\" but not any closer. A beautiful one-liner sums it all up when Clive Owen as Larry (in the setting of a strip club of all places, great juxtaposition) cries out in sheer frustration as he considers the stripping whore in Alice (Natalie Portman):  <br />\\"What do you have to do to get some intimacy around here?\\" A powerful summation of how we as human beings have forgotten the art of loving; we have forgotten how to really be intimate, how to love, how to get \\"closer.\\"  Brilliant.
B00005JLWN|5.0|this movie is totally incredible. you can tell that they didnt have a huge budget but they did awesome. it was so intense. its a good movie that makes you and the fight scenes are really good.
0553573403|5.0|OK, for those of you who haven't read the book, let me give you a little background. I was once just like you. I had read all the hype, all the claims about it being the best fantasy series of all time. If you are like me, you instinctively shy away from over-the-top hype like that. However, I eventually broke down a year ago and started A Game of Thrones, really wanting to hate the book and prove the hype artists wrong. So I'm reading along, the prologue, the first few chapters, thinking to myself \\"This isn't so good, I knew it couldn't be THAT good!!\\" And then, right around page 75........it happened. As I like to call it, \\"The Incident\\". Anyone who has read the book knows exactly what im talking about. I actually stopped dead in my tracks in the middle of the store I own and shouted out loud, \\"WHAT......THE........(BLEEP)????\\" Then went back and re-read that passage 3 times to make sure I read what I thought I read. \\"what......how could he......no way......are you serious.....what a jerk.......well if THAT can happen, what might happen next?!?!\\" and that was it. I was hooked. Yes, the series lives up to ALL that hype and more. It is that good. It is the top of the mountain, the Muhammed Ali greatest of all time series (yes, EVER). In fact, I would warn you that readers of this series are known to develop \\"Martinitis\\", where after you read Martin, fantasy series that you might otherwise have enjoyed just seem to pale in comparison (this has actually happened to me, I started reading Sean Russell's Swans War series, and there was nothing glaringly wrong with it, it just seemed so......tame). Martin has created a detailed, complex world where characters, love it or hate it, ALWAYS suffer the consequences of their actions, for good or bad. In the series you will discover the character who for my money is the most interesting, complex, and compelling ever created in fantasy (Tyrion Lannister) and #2 on that list as well (The Hound). Just go read the books ASAP, and you will be posting your own review on Amazon soon enough, trust me!!u will be posting your own review on Amazon soon enough, trust me!!
B0000AMRJC|4.0|That cruel statement belongs to Pfeiffer lines in the middle of the dinner where she has a dramatic confrontation with Al.<br />This is an ambitious film: in every little detail, and that's precisely their demerits. Al Pacino looks overacted in every frame of the picture, and his recent acting in the Godfather II makes of his character a simple extension of Michel Corleone. I know every one of Brian de Palma previous works and I guess he wanted to add a different and renovated gaze to this terrible gangster. But I think there was an exaggeration touch all over the film, making it perhaps extremely narcissist and hyper realist.  In the other hand it seems a big task to try to demystify Howard Hawks' s Scarface.<br />But the huge talent and his magic handle of camera save the film, leading it to secure port. There are however highlight sequences in slow motion that even would be improved in The Untouchables, so you may consider this film as work in progress.<br />The final sequence is anthological in purpose and reveals the Fall of so many dictators on the history but sinned of ambition and petulance.
0425038912|5.0|Dune is a classic. And this book answers some of the most fundamental questions that Dune fans have always had.  What did the characters look like? <br /> <br />In the book there's about 13 illustrations. And about half of them are in color. The illustrations themselves are not terrific by any standards. In fact, I don't even think they're consistent with the Dune series. (In book V Heretics to Dune Chani's hair color is quoted as red.  In the Illustrated Dune, it's clearly black.) But I enjoyed them nonetheless. <br /> <br />Other than the few pictures there's nothing to distinguish this book from the original.  The illustrations are by John Schoenherr, the same guy who did the original cover art.  The copyright is 1977.
0767903862|5.0|My first foray into the world of Bill Bryson's work has left an indelible mark on me - i am in love with it, and cannot get enough of it. It's hard enough to try to get to know and write about a such a great expanse of land when you're not Australian -but Bryson for the most part successfully does so. As an Australian who has lived in the US for the past 8 years, I cannot say i would be able to write as comprehensively and accurately about his country as he has about mine!  <br />A sharp wit combined with a wonderful sense of humor made this a real page turner; Bryson accurately captures the essence and feeling of Australia - he comes not only to appreciate and understand us, but in the little pub in Daly Waters, I believe he becomes one of \\"us.\\" Bryson captures all the beauty, irony, sadness, history, and geography that makes up this beautiful place I call home, and his gentle blend of fact and humor and anecdote makes this an unforgettable read. To elaborate: his ability to point out the inherent irony in \\"losing a prime minister\\" and subsequently naming a public swimming pool after a man who drowned is something that has always baffled me too, and i'm Australian! Or the fact that our national volume of history is only written up to the year 1935 made me question just how \\"modern\\" Australia really is. Bryson reports several times throughout that \\"it feels like 1951\\" - and that was interesting to learn, given that it is his American perspective. So too, i can similarly say as much about America when i see an antiquated wood-panelled wagon pass me on the most advanced road system in the world, or people signing checks at the supermarket check out (checks are no longer in use in Australia), which makes Bryson's alien perspecitve on Australia all the more interesting!  <br />I enjoyed how Bryson gently touched on sensitive points too - our general lack of confidence and identity for example - i never knew how confused we were, when Bryson accurately noted that we're not sure if we're brits or yanks, even in the green room!  <br />My only criticisms would extend to Bryson's implication that aussies are \\"self absorbed\\" - something which I would strongly argue as false, given that much more international news reaches Australia's four paltry television stations than it does any of the 400+ cable tv/news media in the US.  <br />Another point of contention: the implication that Australia tends to exist on the peripheries of the planet, outside of the \\"known world\\"(p238). I personally found this to be offensive. Bryson's claims that \\"[in Australia] it is easy to forget....that there is a world out there\\" (p239) is blatantly untrue; in fact, i find that most Australians are very much engaged in world affairs both internally and abroad, and I would go so far as to say that I think they are more well informed on most international matters than are Americans. I tend to think it is Americans who are more \\"disconnected,\\" to quote Bryson here, and it is not the implied \\"distance\\" which is the cause, but a very controlled and closed media. The reason you don't hear anything about Australia in the US is simply because it is not of interest, it is not reported. Every Australian knows the name of the US President or the capital; however, ask the average American who is Australia's Prime Minister or where Canberra is and all you will get is a blank look in return. My only other quibble is that of the voice; i'm puzzled why Bryson would lend an Australian tone and slang to a book written from an obvoiusly American perspective? I would have prefered to hear \\"sweater\\" not jumper etc etc. as this lends to the authenticity of the author's work.  <br /> <br />Overall, a beautifully written, comprehensive and detailed account of Van Diemans Land. Bryson sure has done a lot of hard homework in between beers, and it, as well as his love for Australia shows. Further, i am sure all Australians will be thankful to him for many years to come for documenting this place I call home. <br />(This review is also under Bill Bryon's \\"Down Under\\" - same book, different title and cover) <br />
B000002J09|2.0|I like Led Zeppelin ok but this album sucks!! Why do people think  this is the greatest album of all time? People so much like  this band, Beatles, and the Stones. They are too overrated. The  only good songs on this CD is Rock and Roll, and Stairway to Heaven. Black Dog is one of the most annoying songs ever! This is definately not the best album ever! Want  some better rock and roll? Pick up Guns N' Roses' Appetite for  Destruction, and Dire Straits' Love over Gold.    I hate this  buy those 2 insted.
B00005JL9B|5.0|This movie has so much more meaning to it besides the insane violence. Even the violence isn't mindless and pointless; try putting YOURSELF in this situation: hunt or be hunted. It's the simple rules of the animal kingdom, which has now been applied to these children. <br /> <br />The music of this movie is just outstanding. Some of it lightens the mood; especially when the Blue Danube Waltz plays after 12 children are killed. While others give the scene a tragic mood using vocalization. <br /> <br />The fact that this movie will not see a US release dissapoints me. Not because I live in the US, but because our society needs the message that this movie gives out. In fact, many other \\"gore-fests\\" appear in the US that are way worse than Battle Royale. Such examples would include Ichi the Killer and Suicide Club (Suicide Circle). <br /> <br />This movie is currently my favorite movie, since it means so much and shows the true side of humans in such a desperate situation. I definitely reccomend this movie to anyone who doesn't misinterpret the movie as \\"just another gore-fest,\\" but like a movie with meaning.
B00062J00S|5.0|This is absolutely my idea of the best movie ever made. I have seen all the so called \\"best movies ever made\\" and this one wins hands down. I watch it every year, and never get tired of it. CITIZEN KANE has nothing on this movie.
0441172717|5.0|A must read for any sci-fi fan.  Herbert's Dune series is to sci-fi what Tolkien's LOTR is to fantasy.  Great character development and a well thought-out plot.  You won't be able to put this one down!
B00000K3UU|5.0|Adam Sandler is always entertaining, but Big Daddy never really piqued my interest; looking back now, I think the previews of this film did it a disservice.  Certainly, Big Daddy has its course moments, but it's an excellent comedy that just so happens to have a heart.  Some would say this film sets a bad example for kids.  First of all, this isn't one of those education films of the 1950s that tells you how to be a good parent.  More importantly, though, what you have here is a guy who is more than willing to \\"grow up\\" and change his life in order to be a father to a kid he genuinely loves.  Plenty of fathers in the world raise their kids to be little gentlemen and ladies, but often it's more about a father not wanting his son or daughter to embarrass him than it is about genuine fatherly love.  To me, Big Daddy is - in its own quirky, Sandler-ish way - a tribute to all the fathers out there who genuinely love their children.<br /><br />As usual, Sandler plays a character who has never really grown up; Sonny Koufax is a law school graduate, but he works in a toll booth one day a week and basically tries to live as if he is still an undergrad.  His girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) wants a man of means and goals, and he's trying to figure out how to get her back when little Julian (played by Cole and Dylan Sprouse) is literally dropped at his doorstep.  It's not even his kid; the biological father is Sonny's roommate who has just left town on business.  Sonny tells his newly-engaged buddy that he will handle everything, initially planning just to keep the kid until Social Services opens the next day - but he can't let little Julian be tossed into an orphanage.  He doesn't exactly follow Dr. Spock's rules for parenthood, but Sonny soon comes to love the little tyke - even after it becomes clear that he and Vanessa are through.  When Social Services finds a family for Julian, Sonny can't give him up - until he's forced to.  The fact that he posed as the kid's biological father doesn't stand him in good stead when he tries to get custody of the kid, but he's determined to try.<br /><br />Sonny teaches Julian a lot of dubious things, but he also does the kid right when he realizes that his laissez faire parenting method isn't what is best for the child when it comes to schoolwork and the like - and he comes up with some pretty ingenious ways to inspire Julian.  Before this film is through, there are actually a few heartwarming moments - which are accomplished without sacrificing any of the comedy.  The cast is great (even Jon Stewart isn't all that bad); Joey Lauren Adams in particular brings a special something to the film as Sonny's new girlfriend.<br /><br />I don't, as a rule, enjoy comedies built around children doing some of the disgusting things that children do, but Big Daddy was a pleasant, very entertaining surprise.  You can't really go wrong with a Sandler movie - laughs are guaranteed, and there's almost always much more to the story than you might expect.ological father doesn't stand him in good stead when he tries to get custody of the kid, but he's determined to try. <br /> <br />Sonny teaches Julian a lot of dubious things, but he also does the kid right when he realizes that his laissez faire parenting method isn't what is best for the child when it comes to schoolwork and the like - and he comes up with some pretty ingenious ways to inspire Julian.

B0009MA8V0|5.0|though US stations won't play this album their refusal to do so proves its  point.  American  punk rock?  Yes.  And with a punch.  Title track is worth the cost.  Full powerful rock band sound; tons of energy; and amazingly telling and intelligent lyrics that give relief because some talented people in the States are yelling their objections.  I love this album and advise you to get yours now as availability in the present political climate is not guaranteed.  I don't see how you can party in 2005 without this cd going full blast.
B00001PE4D|5.0|I have watched \\"Cruel Intentions\\" like a thousand times. It is my favorite movie of all time. I love the characters and the plot. If you have seen the movie, I hope you agree. I recommend everyone see it, but after seeing it, skip \\"Cruel Intentions 2\\" and go straight to \\"Cruel Intentions 3\\". CI2 sucks and CI3 is quite impressive.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have STARWARS Trilogy The LASERDISC Special Edition Remastered Boxset,And I bought the WS DVD Boxset too,One of my Favorite Movies :)
B0009I7NNA|5.0|ok, I might be the only on of the few people on here who would rate this cd higher than Waking the Fallen. I only say that, because WtF became a little tiring after awhile. I loved the heavy guitar, and the screams were tight, but there were a few parts on it that I thought would've sounded better with straight singing than screaming. It's still an amzing cd, but for me personally, it just kept them in the same bracket as Atreyu and other bands similar. to try something so radically different as Ax7 have done on this cd is quite a risk, and I think they pulled it off magnificently. They sound like NO other band out right now. Often times sounding like Guns and Roses, and then switching to an Iron Maiden-esque sound, before going into a straight metal, and then having neoclassical breakdowns. They really went for it on this cd, and I applaud them for it. While it doesn't have as many memorable heavy riffs, it seems like they went for songs that were well thought and took an amzing amount of musicianship to pull off. as a guitar player, who appreciates the ability to do something other than chug away on a downtuned open chord, I was AMAZED at the technical ability of Gates and Vengeance. The vocals of Shadows reminded me a lot of Scott Weiland and Axl Rose. Very sleazy, and I loved it. While he does seem to be whining occasionally, I think he did fine for deciding to sing the whole cd, and not just hide behind screams.  <br /> <br />Beast and the Harlot-8/10 <br />I thought this song was a very interesting opener. They decided to jump right into showing what their new sound was about, and the guitar work is stunning. my favorite part though is the verses. a heavy riff behind some very cool sounding vocals. and the drumming is fantastic. <br /> <br />Burn it Down-7/10 <br />One of the few songs on here that I found a little lacking in all departments. the singing isn't bad, but I found this to be one of the few songs on here that aren't entirely impressive. some cool parts, but as a whole, there are much better songs to come. <br /> <br />Blinded in Chains-8/10 <br />Another very solid song, some very cool interludes here and there, and the mix of the acoustic stuff in parts with the wicked guitar playing was nice to hear. <br /> <br />Bat Country-9/10 <br />There first single I believe, and this song is put together very well, and the chorus is one of my favorites on the cd. I really like the way they put the cleaner guitars in to effect on this song. A good representation of the cd as a whole. Some great guitar playing, and some nice drumming going on as well. The guitar playing reminded me a lot of Zakk Wylde in the solo.  <br /> <br />Trashed and Scattered-9/10 <br />This song is badass. The fast tempo of the verses breaking down into the heavy bass riff, before going into a great chorus is a cool formula. And when the song does breakdown into the chugging metal standard, the rhythm is very heavy, and when the guitar kicks in during the outro, it's on of my favorite parts of the cd.  <br /> <br />Seize the Day-10/10 <br />One of my favorite songs on thsi cd by far. VERY Guns and Roses, with piano, and some of the best Slash sounding guitar playing I've heard since November Rain, which is what I would consider this song. a7x's November Rain. The perfect lyrics to fit the song, and that guitar solo...one of the best and most emotional guitar solo's I've heard in a LONG time. I get chills everytime he hits that pinched harmonic at the end. A masterpiece of a song. Sure to be a classic. <br /> <br />Sidewinder-10/10 <br />This song is another epic masterpiece. The guitar playing on this song is simply jaw-dropping. One of my favorite choruses on the cd. This is metal symphony. So many different parts, and then suddenly breaking down into a flamenco guitar part to end it. brilliant. to mix the neoclassical stylings of Malmsteen and Vai with a spanish guitar outro without sounding cheesy...wow.  <br /> <br />The Wicked End-10/10 <br />This song deserves such a high rating on just the Danny Elfman sounding orchestra/choral part in the middle alone. But the slow heavy parts are also a favorite part of this cd for me. And the singing after the orchestra part is one of the more emotional moments on this cd.  Three masterpieces in a row.  <br /> <br />Strength of the World-9/10 <br />Most of this song is close to being in the same league as the last three, but the chorus is probably my least favorite part of the cd. but the verse riffs, and everything else really is genius. Would be another masterpiece without the chorus. <br /> <br />Betrayed-8/10 <br />That opening riff is WICKED! but after that the song kind of goes downhill. While not a bad song, it just kind of takes the momentum built up by the last four songs down a bit. A tribute to Dimebag, and the lyrics reflect this, I just didn't get the effect. <br /> <br />MIA-10/10 <br />After a little bit of a letdown with Betrayed, I was wondering how they would end the cd, and this song is the PERFECT end to the cd. A very nice, melodic intro, before going to a gallpoing riff that is very heavy and catchy at the same time. Hello Iron Maiden. The lyrics are brilliant.and the heavy part at about 4:05 is amazing. especially the guitar playing going on in the background when it goes to a less chugging part. The guitar solo is another one of the higlights of this cd. I thought maybe he had run out of ideas, but I was wrong. and the return to the clean melodic part for the end, with the acoustic sounding solo fade out of the cd is a fine end for a very good cd. <br /> <br />All being said, the high points of this cd FAR outweigh the low points. Seize the DAy, Sidewinder, The Wicked End, and MIA, are four masterpieces that any band would be lucky to have just one of on a cd. Avenged Sevenfold have ventured beyond the comfort zone that most bands of their genre are clinging to, and leapt into an entirely new genre that will take them into the ranks of the elite bands coming out of the US. <br /> <br />
B000929AJQ|2.0|I have loved NIN for many years now and I was pretty happy to see this album come out. BUT I hate to say it sucks pretty bad. Trents \\"I'm a dark depressed loser\\" act has run it's course!! With the teethuhhhhhhhhhh it the worst NIN song I have ever heard!!! Also, stop with the DUALDISC CRAP!!! make one damn cd then stop! It's just a lame way to make money on a lame album!! Also, good ol trent just rematered the the downward spiral cd too. WHY???? Isnt that the whole point of cd's? so the sound is digital audio from the start?? Don't be fooled. I did give this 2 stars because I love RIGHT WHERE IT BELONGS, but other then that this cd blows. Keep your eye out for the re-mix of this junk, I'm sure it's on the way too!
B0000508U6|5.0|Upon purchasing this cd, I felt as though I had literally just won the lottery.  This cd was so unlike anything I had heard, and Coldplay was such an unheard of band, I thought I had stumbled on to the next big thing (which years later, I realized I have).  But gone now from Coldplay's music is the creativeness, and the simplicity that made this cd so incredible.  While back then Chris Martin's vocals seemed so wonderfully endearing, now with X&Y seem to be so contrived, and generic.  This cd was so basic in it's recording, many of the tracks seeming to be nothing more than Martin and an acoustic guitar... very simple drum beats if any, compared to X&Y which is loud, and tries to be much to anthemic.  I only wish Coldplay will come back on album 4 with the formula of ablum 1.. but the fact they are selling rediculous amounts of cds can only ensure the fact we can expect X&Y part 2. <br /> <br />From Don't Panic, straight thru to Everything's Not Lost, with hi-lites of Yellow, Trouble, and Hi-Speed in the middle, I'd have to say this cd was in my player 90 percent of the time, within the first 6 months of it's release.. I played it right into the ground, and yet can come back now and listen to it, and still enjoy it.   <br /> <br />Oddly enough, Coldplay has always been so \\"anti-corporate,\\" and supposedly hates share holders and what not.. and all I can see out of there new album is them trying to appease these people, by making such a radio friendly (in a very bad sense) and massively appealing album.  I feel they've sold out, and while they've garnered themselves many new listeners out there, I believe I'm not the only Parachutes fan who feels lost listening to their current music. <br /> <br />Please Coldplay, give us another Parachutes of Rush of Blood to the Head.. Please!!!!!!!!

B000050HTO|5.0|But where's all the songs from Highway 61 Revisited? This compilation could've had at least \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" \\"From a Buick 6,\\" and \\"Ballad of a Thin Man.\\" And it definitely should've had \\"Desolation Row\\" on it. <br /> <br />Maybe a few more songs from Blood on the Tracks too. And one of my favourites, \\"Sara\\" from Desire. <br /> <br />I guess you just can't fit all the REAL essentials on only 2 discs. <br /> <br />Get this compilation if you're a casual fan. But, for your own sake, get the albums. All the gold is in the albums.
B00080EU58|2.0|I love Slipknot but this album sucks!!!!! It's very weak. Iowa blows the doors off this crap! I have tried to listen to this cd many times and I just can't. Also, what's with all this re-mastered bull$hit??!! year 2005 and bands still have to re-master lame cds that they just released. HMMM? can you say rip-off?!!! make one damn cd then stop! Please! It's like bands that put out cd's with differnt covers. They think were all so dumb we will buy them all. Give me a break. Old slipknot rocks, but I hope this is the last cd like this........
B0002858YS|3.0|I bought this cd at the same time as the Franz Ferdinand cd.  I was expecting the 2 to be very similar.  In some aspects, they were, but this one is definitely the better of the two.  What you get in this Hot Fuss cd, is a somewhat solid rock album, with a definite 80's twist to it, and a certain degree of \\"glam\\" rock.   <br /> <br />I was excited to see the Brandon Flowers got much of his inspiration as a musician from seeing my guys, Oasis live in Las Vegas.  Brandon has a great voice, and it shines thru in many tracks.  Definite standouts would be mr. brightside and smile like you mean it.  Believe it or not, one of my least favorite tracks would be Sombebody told me... that's not a very good song, in my opinion.   <br /> <br />This isn't the greatest cd out there, but it's a fun listen thru most tracks.  Give it a try.

B0007NFL18|5.0|I listened to this C.D. Recently &amp; I felt that it is good work by 50 Cent. I have always liked rap groups such as 50 Cent becuase they have a great melody to their rap songs.<BR>A lot of these songs, such as &quot;Candy Shop&quot; can create a good evening party enviroment. Although the C.D. has some langauge in it, the songs still serve their purpose. <BR>This C.D. would be a good choice for a staff party or for a party for friends. To like this C.D. to its fullest you have to like rap and like the group, other wise it might not be one of your favourites. If you are into rap, then this is something new and fresh. So I would recommend this C.D.
B000002TQB|4.0|This cd was released almost the same time as the number one album of all time (in my opinion) Oasis' What's The Story (Morning Glory)... and while the Oasis effort is superior to this album in every way, this Blur album does help define the British music scene at the time.  And what a time it was.. we over here in the states couldn't imagine what was to come from these 2 bands.  Blur was everything that Oasis hated, and that's what got the famed Oasis/Blur rivalry started.   <br /> <br />Damon Albarn is about as different a lead singer as you can get when compared to Liam Gallagher.  Liam is so in your face, and raw and unabashed.  Damon is very smooth and suave in his delivery, and you can just hear that British accent coming thru in his lyrics, every song.   <br /> <br />My faves here would have to be Tracy Jacks, Badhead, Parklife, and This is A Low.  I would recommend this cd to anyone who wants a better understanding of why the whole Oasis/Blur spat came about... just listening to this album and What's The Story.. you can just tell.  But both are very good, for very different reasons.  If I can like this album, you can too.  Give it a chance.. it'll definitely grow on you if you give it a chance.

0385720920|5.0|Plot: Excellent <br />Writing: Excellent <br />Pace: Excellent <br /> <br />A lesson in human depravity.  This kind of dark satire is right up my ally.  It's jaded humor through cynical eyes that keeps me laughing, when most would be offended.  It's witty and original.  His writing style is excellent, although he jumps around a bit.  It stays fresh to the end.  Unique isn't the best word, but it's the first word that comes to mind.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I would like to announce to the world that the true genius of Martin Scorsese is back... For in this wonderful movie I caught a glimpse of American History in the form of the tormented genius that was Howard Hughs. <br /> <br />At first I must admit I was skeptical.  I really didn't think that Leonardo DiCaprio had either the acting skill or the emotional maturity to paint the personality portrait of such a complex human being.  But I was wrong because his portrayal was superb. <br /> <br />I also learned so much about Howard Hughes: about his obsessive/compulsive disorder, about his courage and vision, about his passion for the sky and for the movies and its stars.  I even learned that though he was a man of power and madness, there was also a sense of compassion in him.  Perhaps not profound compassion but compassion none-the-less.  And like Frank Sinatra he also struck out with Ava Gardner, a woman who had heard all the lines and was probably jaded to the hilt. <br /> <br />The movie makes use of flashback sequences which bubble up in stream of consciousness fashion.  They help us along with DiCaprio's excellent performance to see into the mind of this deeply flawed visionary.  All of the other supporting actors were of course excellent and well casted.  The scenes were excitingly filmed in a somewhat flamboyant style - yet what more can be expected when you're dealing with someone who was himself a man of deep drives and needs.  Yet the tapestry of Scorsese's film is riveting and full of those subtle scorsese touches that make for profound cinema.   <br /> <br />Of profound import was Alan Alda's portral of Senator Owen Brewster from Maine (A little McCarthy era foreshadowing)?  He played a man with a price very well, and one could see the corruption that is so prevalent in today's politics.  In essence I found him much more evil than the ego manical, sometimes insane and despotic Hughes.  Through Alda's performance I could not help but despise the man and was happy when Hughes raked him over the coals...Also, Alec Balwin gave a sterling performance as the President of Pan Am,  Juan Trippe. <br /> <br />All in all, a wonderful movie from begining to end.  I highly recommend it!

B0009MDPYM|1.0|This was easily one of the worst movies ever made I don't even know where to start. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this I saw it at a sneak preview but I still feel I was ripped off. Let's start with the acting, not one person could in this movie. Keanu Reeves looked like he was trying to figure out how to get out of the movie more than put any effort into his character.  <br /> <br />I guess the next place to look at would be the plot. Most of the time it will leave you going ???????????? There really wasn't much of a story and the movie seemed to drag on, it was slow and dull. When there were any scenes with action they were really unimpressive and could leave you yawning. <br /> <br />Last and least were the special FX, again unimpressive. The FX look like something that came out of a direct to video movie, which this should have. They demons looked like cartoon characters and the parts where they tried to make it look the Matrix failed big time. While I'm no fan of the Matrix(I couldn't even make it through the first one) the effects work well for it, not this movie. <br /> <br />Overall this movie should be avoided even to die hard comic fans. This movie has nothing to do with the comic at all just like the Catwoman movie. If you feel like wasting 2 hours of your life though this movie is for you.

B00004NRWH|4.0|The State is Nickelback's second full length record. It was released in 2000 by Roadrunner records. Many people call this NB's first, but it's not, Curb is. As for the album itself, I found it to be WAY too short. Most of the songs are pretty solid, but man, two more tracks would have made it a hell of alot better. Here is what I thought of each song:     Breathe xxx Good opener, awesome third verse and chorus 5/5     Cowboy Hat xxx Another awesome song 5/5     Leader of men xxx average 3/5     Old enough xxx I like it 4/5     Worthy to say xxx Awesome, very different sound for NB 5/5     Diggin' this xxx Gets old fast 2/5     Deep xxx I like the chorus, but that's it 3/5     One Last Run xxx Only average 3/5     Not leavin' yet xxx An awesome chorus and great lyrics 5/5     Hold out your hand xxx Good offical closer 4/5     Leader of men (acoustic) xxx Pointless 1/5    *                        *                         *    Pros: Good, solid rock, with awesome lyrics.    Cons: Too short, some fillers here and there.    Overall: The State is a good record. A few more songs would have made it better, but NB has this weird thing with making everything they put out as short as possible. 4 out of 5 stars.

B0007Y08IS|4.0|My biggest concern after seeing this movie is that some parents will see it on the rental counter and take it home for their kids to watch.  HUGE MISTAKE!!! <br /> <br />Having said that, I thought this one was both hysterically funny at times and extremely crude at other times.  Definitely worth seeing!  I agree with what one other reviewer said about they could have used more voices.  Also, what is it about Matt Damon being only able to say his own name? <br /> <br />Also, Kim Jong-Il is one of the best movie villains of 2005!  I've heard he loves Hollywood films.  I'd dearly love to see his reaction after viewing this one! <br /> <br />Funny, but PLEASE don't rent it for the kids!

B0001L3MI0|4.0|I liked the story line and the special effects; they had the desired effect.  What put me off was the knowledge of military custom and training. <br /> <br />(1)  A Marine would not call another Marine a \\"soldier.\\" <br />(2)  A jet pilot would not have a clue how to fly a helicopter; there is no cross-training.  It costs too much to train; cross-training is not efficient. <br />(3)  A Marine would not salute without a cover on (\\"hat,\\" to you civilians) under any circumstances.  That means anytime indoors without special circumstances. <br /> <br />Other than those things that directors could find out but are too lazy to, this is a good film.
B00009MGR6|5.0|Great album, though, I liked Fly on The Wall better, that album was underrated, anyways, this one is great, best tracks, Heatseeker, Thats The Way I wanna Rock N' Roll, Kissin' Dynamite, Go Zone, Meanstreak.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|As much as I may or may not like this album, it is irrelevant due to the music industry's sad attempt to lessen the blow of pirated music. I am one of the people who, if I enjoy an album upon hearing it, will buy the CD. I do not like having pirated music in my collection. I own more than 700 legitimately acquired CDs and with my iPod, I have half of them available to me wherever I go. To be told how I am to listen to the music that I purchased is more than aggravating, and I will not be buying ANY copy protected CDs. Ever. It is a sad day that a band as great as the Foo Fighters will not make their way into my CD shelves. However, it may still find its way onto my iPod via a less scrupulous manner. I would have bought this CD had I been granted fair rights, but rights are harder to come by these days and this is my humble protest.
B00008WT5J|4.0|This is not a greatest hits, but most of the songs are from prior albums, buy it anyways.
B00003CXAT|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I think it helps if you were enthralled with dinosaurs when you were a kid like I was, but I don't think it's an absolute to enjoy the movie. A rich Scotsman has hired a staff of scientists who have discovered how to clone dinosaurs from DNA found in ancient mosquitoes trapped in amber. He decides to build a theme park on an island, so the whole world can come see real live dinosaurs. The park needs to be peer reviewed by skilled paleontologists before the insurance companies will back the park. While the scientists are there, the man hired to tie all the computers together to run the park, shuts much of the security off while he steals embryos to sell to a rival genetics company. This sets the scene for dinosaurs such as the T-rex and velociraptors to escape their enclosures and roam the park freely. Since the paleontologists and the owner's grandchildren were on the tour at the time, they now have to fight for their life with huge meat-eating animals. <br /> <br />This is a good, exciting idea and it's well written and well acted. The dinosaurs are so well done you can't believe they are special effects and this was over a decade ago when effects such as these were in there infancy. This is a high quality film in every aspect and I still find it exhilarating no matter how many times I watch it.
B000059T00|5.0|'Blind Faith' is one of the finest albums of the 1960's, perhaps the most progressive decade in music. That should be no surprise as the band combined elements of two of the most talented and inventive bands of the era, lead guitarist Eric Clapton and drummer Ginger Baker, two-thirds of 'Cream', together with keyboardist/lead singer Steve Winwood and bassist Rick Grech, two-fifths of 'Traffic'. The band only managed to stick together for one album and one tour, which also shouldn't have been a surprise given that Winwood's continued indulgence in psychedelic rock and flirtations with jazz fusion were a poor match for Clapton's foray into more traditional pop sounds and life-long side-interest in blues rock.  <br /> <br />Ignoring their flimsy bonds, Clapton, Winwood, and Baker brought five stunning compositions into the studio. For the most part, this album became a Steve Winwood dominated production, with the artist penning fully half of the songs and singing all of the lead vocals, even on Clapton's only entry, his epic 'Presence of the Lord'. Although the set does allow all of the musicians ample room to move, Winwood's characteristic sound, together with Baker's avant garde, jazz influenced contribution ('Do What You Like'), is what gives the disc its overall feel. The bands cover of Buddy Holly's 'Well All Right' along with Clapton's 'Presence...' are clearly the odd tracks out.  <br /> <br />That being said, there is not a bad performance on this disc. All of Winwood's contributions are classics, from the plaintive 'Had To Cry Today', to the tender 1960s's \\"looking for myself\\" nostalgia of 'Can't Find My Way Home', to the rapturous 'Sea of Joy'. Each feature distinctive melodies, endearing lyrics, and elite musicianship. The studio rendition of Clapton's 'Presence of the Lord' probably isn't the definitive version to most people, as numerous live covers have appeared on other releases, in particular with Eric masquerading as 'Derek and the Dominos'. The song evolved and eclipsed its original form. And despite the relative simplicity of 'Well All Right', this band certainly manages to make this song sound like anything but a boppin' 1950's Buddy Holly track. If this was the first song you heard off this album and were told it was the weakest track, you'd surely buy the album without even asking to hear the rest of it.  <br /> <br />The album closes with Ginger Baker literally laying claim to his fifteen minutes of fame, penning the 15 minute-plus 'Do What You Like', another period piece that gave all four musicians an opportunity to solo and, in the end, do what they like. It's probably the most critiqued song in the lot, but a lot of the criticsm comes from people who were expecting too much. 'Blind Faith' is solid, forceful, meaningful, and possesses a personality all its own, and plenty of other 'supergroups' have produced far less. This is a \\"must-own\\" for any collector of rock classics.  <br />
B000002JKS|4.0|Different sound from Robert on this record, good album but not nearly as good as his other albums. Still a must have.
B0000DD7LC|2.0|I've got much respect for Alicia Keys but in the same time I think she's, by far, the most commercial artist in the \\"neo-soul\\" area. Look, she has written a song for Christina Aguilera and made a duet with Usher. Think Jill Scott would have done that?<br />I blame this album because it seems it has been done to satisfy 2 different audiences :  the mature (mostly adults) listeners who are into neo-soul and the teenagers who enjoy the urban pop that MTV and BET can't get enough of.<br />Of course her talent is evident.<br />A song like \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" is magnificent, an instant classic which gave me chills like only a few songs can, the 1st time I have heard it. It's such a fantastic song, really!<br />The 2 other great songs are \\"Diary\\" and \\"If I Ain't Got You\\": these ones really shine too.<br />But well, except these 3 exceptional songs (which were unsurprisingly the singles picks), all the other tracks are really bland and unworthy of such the talented lady Alicia Keys is. This album for me is just boring as hell. I loved the 1st one, and this one is a lot inferior<br />Alicia Keys, you really need to \\"wake up, before it's too late\\"

Why does he sound ashamed of \\"Be here now\\" when at least the band still had musical ambitions back then? Why put every guy in the band to write songs when it's evident they don't have a special talent for it (as Noel does)? Why has the magic gone? (that magic you can still hint only in the track \\"Let there be love\\" on this album). <br />Why do they seem to put more effort in attacking other artists than in their own music?

0671027573|3.0|Although I loved this book and read all  <br />of it this morning, <br />I do have some criticisms. <br />First of all, Jaine's and Sam's relationship developed <br />much too fast.  <br />She went from being irritated by him,  <br />to sex with him (especially after  <br />peeping at his nude body <br />through her window) to engagement  <br />in the span of a 2 or 3 weeks! <br />For someone who's broken 3 engagements, <br />I would think she's be a little more cautious. <br />and he being the victim of a bad marriage, <br />I would think he'd be a little more cautious too. <br />And why would Jaine continuouslly allow BooBoo, <br />the cat, to destroy her couch. <br />Couldn't she lock him up in another room <br />while she's at work-- <br />like the bathroom--where he couldn't  <br />destroy anything? <br />Or buy a scratching post, some toys  <br />for his amusement etc? <br />Since she works full time and couldn't <br />properly care for the needs of a cat, <br />and just moved into a new home, why <br />didn't she just say \\"no\\" to her mom? <br />She could have offered to pay to board <br />the cat in a kennel. <br />Also, how did Leah become employed,  <br />with her history, in an electronics firm?  <br />Don't they do background checks?  <br />Security clearances? <br />If someone like her,a pyschotic killer,  <br />can become employed with such a firm, <br />then the world is in serious trouble!!! <br />
B00000612P|5.0|I recently got this album, and it blew my socks off....so to speak. <br /> <br />I'm twenty-one, and my parents played Rod Stewart, Elton John, Beach Boys, etc. so I grew up with this music.  The music of today hardly compares to this time period in history.  Today its more about superficiality and topping everybody off rather than writing music that actually says something. <br /> <br />Anyhow...my fave songs are \\"Maggie May\\" (timeless classic) \\"(I Know) I'm Losing You\\", and \\"Seems Like A Long Time.\\"  The other runner ups include \\"Tomorrow is a Long Time\\" (which, despite the fact that I am an avowed Bob Dylan fan, I must admit is better than the one on Greatest Hits II), \\"Mandolin Wind\\" and \\"Reason to Believe.\\" <br /> <br />An awesome album.  Totally recommended if you're a classic rock or Rod Stewart fan.
B0002858YS|4.0|New Wave?!?  Does anybody remember bands like the Eurythmics, the Cure, the Smiths and New Order?  In 2005, New Wave appears to have a rebirth.  Hailing from Las Vegas, NV, The Killers have transformed the 1980's musical genre into contemporary rock fodder via release of their Island Records debut, Hot Fuss. Recent years has shown resurgence in the now defunct music format.  No Doubt scored a top 10 hit with \\"It's My Life,\\" a re-working of Talk Talk's 1984 hit.   <br /> <br />Originally released in summer 2004, Hot Fuss scored modest success with its first single, \\"Somebody Told Me\\".  The single made inroads at rock radio outlets; which translated into moderate success on Top 40 markets.  The single strikes similar comparisons to Blur's \\"Girls & Boys\\".  Both songs feature a catchy back-beat, a pop-punk-techno hook and cover similar lyrical content. <br /> <br />The second single release, \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" brought major break-through success for The Killers.  The single was a huge hit worldwide and a remained a fixture in the Top 10 stateside in spring 2005.  This is a prime example of what The White Stripes would sound like; if they were a pop band.  \\"Mr. Brightside\\" packs a hot beat, tantalizing drums, appealing lyrics and injects the need to dance. <br /> <br />Every song on Hot Fuss tells an interesting story.  The same is true on third single, \\"All These Things That I've Done\\".  While not as catchy as the first two singles, this single deserves attention in its own right.  \\"I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier\\" sums up the transpiring message here.   <br /> <br />Other standout tracks include:  \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine,\\" \\"Smile Like You Mean It,\\" and \\"On Top\\".   <br />
B00004YA66|5.0|Combining the 'moving' nature of great dramas with the excitement and tension of great thrillers, \\"Frequency\\" is about a grown son (policeman Jim Caviezel) connecting over shortwave radio with his father (Dennis Quaid) thirty years in the past, shortly before the latter died.  Communicating through time, the son manages to prevent the father's death but finds history changed, with the mother of the family now the one who died early and threats emerging to more members of the family in both time periods.  Comes off completely believable with great acting and storyflow, highly effective cinematography in the firefight and chase-type scenes, and sparsely used but masterful special effects. Has one of the more riveting climaxes out there, finishing things off with a grand slam.  In the spirit and mood of such greats as \\"Ghost\\" and \\"The Green Mile\\"
B000001C6M|3.0|Slayer are generally a polarizing force within the metal world.  On one hand, you have the diehard Hessians who would probably slit throats at a nursing home for this band if asked, and on the other you have the metal fans who scoff at their simplistic style, clich&eacute;d lyrics, and laughable \\"Satanic\\" image and plug amazing albeit relatively obscure metal bands such as Meshuggah and Cryptopsy in their one-star reviews of Reign In Blood.  I myself am somewhere in the middle of these two archetypes.<br /><br />Slayer's music is definitely simplistic, but it's also a heck of a lot of fun.  Restraining headbanging, fist-pumping, and throwing up the horns are difficult within Show No Mercy's scant duration (about 35 minutes).  The choruses are anthemic, the riffs catchy, and the drumming is solid.  The solos are, of course, really goofy and all over the place, but I don't really mind them unless someone tries to claim King and Hannemann as among the best metal guitarists of all time (pretty much the equivalent of praising the guitar chops of Kurt Cobain or Johnny Ramone).  Show No Mercy's songs are definitely simple pleasures, but they're also great ones.<br /><br />Then there's the stuff that's harder to ignore: the horrible, clich&eacute;d lyrics and trite image the band tries to craft for itself.  For music so simple, injecting elements of the theatrical is really stupid.  Here's a guideline: when Emperor dresses up in corpsepaint and leather and writes songs about Satan, blood, and death, it's cool because their sweeping, colossal, and aurally crushing sound is not unlike the probable soundtrack to hell; when Slayer tries it, it looks stupid because they are miserable lyric-writers and have a sound more akin to punk/hardcore than most metal.  They seem more like a bunch of high school kids trying to scare their parents than musicians meant to be taken seriously.  If Slayer didn't concentrate on their image so much and put more work into their lyrics, they could probably be held in the same regard in the metal world as Motorhead (another band that's simple, fast, and fun as hell, but never aligned itself with trying to be \\"evil\\").be held in the same regard in the metal world as Motorhead (another band that's simple, fast, and fun as hell, but never aligned itself with trying to be \\"evil\\"). <br />
B00003CX5P|4.0|If I had done a writeup for this before seeing \\"Episode 2 - Attack Of The Clones\\" there would not have been a chance of giving it anything over three stars, and despite the awesome visuals and some great new characters, I would have been tempted (though I probably wouldn't have done it) to drop it straight down to a two-star rating due to my crushing disappointment with certain aspects of the film, which I'll elaborate on later.  After seeing \\"Attack Of the Clones\\" and reassessing \\"Phantom Menace\\", this one would have been assured of a strong 3-stars and there may have been an inclination to go for four.  After \\"Revenge Of The Sith\\" Episode 1 now does indeed get a four-star rating, partly because I understand it better and partly because it's an integral part of what turned out to be a new trilogy rivalling the original. <br /> <br />For the film itself - in the original trilogy, and in the novels that followed years later (two of the best being \\"Heir To The Empire\\" and \\"The Truce At Bakura\\"), we got a certain perception of what the Old Republic and the Jedi Knights were like, or at least I did. A practically utopic galaxy in most aspects.  The Jedis as noble defenders of justice and peace and all that is good.  Harmony among the races.  A galactic Golden Age that had lasted eons, with prosperity and freedom for all, right up until the Sith came. <br /> <br />This is not what Episode 1 showed. The Republic and its 'glorious' Jedis, nearly all of the ones we get to know seeming to have a disconcerting air of superiority about them, allow slavery and other organized criminal activity to survive and flourish, as long as it's in the outer systems, far enough away not to be a bother to the prosperous core worlds of the New Republic.  It's shocking to see Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi so....pompous, basically.  And hypocritical, although we do see them seem to start coming around later on, progressing towards the characters everybody knew and loved in the first trilogy.  I understand it now though - 1) we're not just seeing that Anakin Skywalker was good and then went bad, we're seeing Why he went bad, and 2) the decay was creeping into the Republic long prior to the arrival of Sidious and Darth Maul; perhaps there was a time, not too many decades before Episode 1, where the galaxy was as idyllic as it was made out to have been; but it's not now, as the movie opens.  And the Jedis have been too overconfident and complacent to notice it, perhaps too complacent to realize how much they're letting slide.  One of the few major characters we're introduced to who actually is striving to better the whole of the galaxy, not just maintain the privelaged status quo, is Padme, who was one of this film's saving graces even before the hindsights given by Episode 2.  Another interesting thing - the reaction to the droids, including C-3PO and R2-D2 but also droids in general.  Most characters seem to react to them as if they're lower-class peons.  The Jedis ignore them except when they're giving them orders, basically acting as if they're toasters.  All this in spite of the fact that all indications through the original trilogy, and through this one too starting right here, that they give all appearances of being at least partly if not fully sentient (I always thought Luke's \\"offer\\" to Jabba in \\"Return Of The Jedi\\" was a ruse not meant to be taken seriously).  Only Padme, Annakin and Jar-Jar, perhaps Shmi Skywalker as well, interact and speak with the droids the same way they would any other lifeform.  And as for Jar-Jar Binks, can people give him half a break?  Yes, he accidentally gets in the way alot, and can even be annoying at times, but he's got a genuine heart, which seems to be more than you can say about half the Jedi Council. <br /> <br />So many surprises, both when I first saw this and that I'm seeing in a new light now.  Who would have ever guessed, based on the original trilogy, that Darth Vader/Annakin Skywalker was a child born into slavery who spent his spare time freeing little animals from various predicaments because 'every creature deserves to be free'?  Who would have guessed that after the Jedis rescued Annakin from his slavery, they would have LEFT HIS MOTHER AND THE REST OF THE SLAVES TO ROT under Watto's ownership? (the apparant - and highly troubling - explanation seems to be that they just saw no need to free them, as opposed to Annakin who they wanted to free not for his own sake, but to train such a 'Force-strong' child as a Jedi)  And if you saw this movie first, without Episodes 4-6, who would have guessed at the way the chilling final hour of Episode III would play out? <br /> <br />I'm using up wordage fast, so I'll make the rest of my points quickly - some of the greatest visuals in movie history, as with all three Star Wars prequels.  Darth Maul is a villain worthy of standing on the same pedestal as the Emperor, the Fetts, Thrawn (familiar to the novel readers) and even the greatest and most terrible of them all, Vader.  Jake Lloyd is great as Anakin, Natalie Portman is great as Padme (although she's even better in the next two), Terrence Stamp gives an impressive if brief turn as Chancellor Vallorum and Ian McDiamind is perfect in all three movies (he should get an Oscar for this year's \\"Revenge Of The Sith\\" but the Academy probably won't even consider him.)  More holes in logic here than the next two, by far.  Other points I'll wait and cover in my Episode 2 writeup. <br /> <br />In the end, I've upped my opinion of this film because I've learned to stop mourning the prequels I thought I was going to get (they'll always be alive in my head) and enjoy this magnificent new trilogy, weakest chapter included, for the prequels we got.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|All I can say is that the concert is practically flawless and they actually sound like a studio recording. I chose to listen to it in PCM rather than DTS which to me had an unnatural high pitch to it. I have B&W 604 speakers which is the same brand (not model) that George Lucas uses. You could even hear that the drums have a bouncy ripple to them. Very enjoyable nice mellow concert with almost every song being a hit. I give it a 5!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|One of the earliest stunners from masterpiece-maker Studio Ghibli, \\"Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind\\" takes place centuries in the future in a world covered by a globe-spanning super jungle that grows thousands of feet into the sky.  Various human settlements still exist here and there where the jungle hasn't choked them out, and gigantic, dangerous insects called the Ohmu are among the strange and fascinating creatures inhabiting this altered new world. <br /> <br />With the human settlements linked together in co-operation by only a tenuous peace and with the toxic jungle continuing its envelopment of everything in its path (kind of like the human jungle is doing to the natural world today come to think of it; this movie is full of allegory and metaphor, both envirornmental and otherwise) the fragile semi-balance is upset by the discovery by one of the other settlements of an ancient, incredibly powerful weapon from the distant past and the war that basically destroyed the previous world and ushered in this one, and has the potential to dominate or destroy again.  Naturally, humanity being what it is, gaining control of this new discovery becomes top priority for one of the less amicable and more powerful of the small civilizations. <br /> <br />As with all Ghibli material - gorgeous animation and seemingly unlimited imagination intertwine in bringing this world to life; this is one of the first Ghibli films, predating \\"Castle In The Sky\\", \\"Spirited Away\\", et al. so the techical aspects of the animation are not quite as advanced as later efforts but were still a quantum leap at the time and remain impeccably gorgeous today; basically the only big difference is there's not nearly so much movement in the backgrounds as in later Ghiblis, which reached the pinnacle of full animation.  A minor point; when it still looks this good and is this effective it's not even a flaw.  The color combinations used in creating the various fungus lifeforms that make up so much of the jungle, including almost all of the undersections where sunlight wouldn't reach (one of the ways in which even the most fantastic of Ghibli worlds maintain a strong believability and realism), and the quick darting motions of the enchanting small animals are just magnificent. <br /> <br />Filled with enough memorable, fully realized characters and enough concept to easily pack an 800-page fantasy novel, and with surprises both beautiful and terrible, \\"Nausicca\\" is most similar to \\"Princess Mononoke\\" and to a lesser extent \\"Castle In The Sky\\".  Includes a heart-stopping final fifteen minutes or so; this is a movie for Every movie lover, but big people, you should sit in with your wee ones on this; it's more intense and frightful than western animation (not that there's anything wrong with Disney and their peers!).  Even after the final credits start to roll you'll want to keep watching even if you're not one of the viewers who, like myself, insists on sitting through to the very end every time anyway - not to give anything away, but more short scenes pop up. <br /> <br />   It seems that not only can Studio Ghibli do no wrong, they can do less than utterly excel.  Yet ANOTHER All-Time Winner!
1400043662|5.0|I would agree with other Murakami fans that this was perhaps not his finest novel.   However, his amazing storytelling ability shines in various moments of this novel and it is the choices that his characters make that continue to fascinate me. <br /> <br />A previous novel, Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, his main character interacts with a librarian and makes a certain choice.    Here, too, Kafka deals with a librarian and makes a choice.    <br /> <br />Although I think that Hard Boiled Wonderland is the superior novel, this novel is a compelling look at the same type of story with a different choice. <br /> <br />I continue to be impressed with Murakami's ability to take large chances in his novels with ridiculous ideas and somehow make them plausible and completely rational in the scope of the larger story.    <br /> <br />He is still at the top of his game, but perhaps this novel is revisiting some concepts that he has previously written about. <br />I would agree that some of the mystery seems removed from this novel, perhaps because it is examining similar questions again from a new perspective. <br /> <br />I think that this novel is for the patient Murakami fan that is willing to look past some of this.   It may not be his best novel, but he takes more chances than many and somehow pulls it off.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|Wow.  This is one of those films that you struggle trying to convey how bad it really is.  But put it this way.  I bought it on Pay Per View and downloaded to my DVR.  After sitting through the first fifteen minutes (fast forwarding a lot), I finally gave up and just put it at x4 speed.  It still dragged.   <br /> <br />If you're a South Park fan, don't think that this will automatically mean you'll like this movie.  South Park is fast moving with some depth and wit.  This film, despite being 3D puppets, is flat and wouldn't know wit if it blew it up (which happens a lot in this movie).   <br /> <br />It's not funny.  It's not well done.  It's a waste of time and money (I finally zipped through at x300.  It still dragged). <br /> <br />The bottom line?  Don't bother.
077106506X|4.0|... but I'm wondering why, in the previous posting, Randy States wrote: &quot;Munro is a Canadian, and one might suspect she would be somewhat limited in her material.&quot; Why would she be &quot;somewhat limited&quot; by being Canadian? Unless I'm not reading this right, this appears to me like a very condescending statement. I'm glad Ms Munro's writing proved him wrong, in this case, at least...
B0002EXH4A|4.0|Hmm, I'll probably keep this one pretty short.  'So Far, So Good... So What!' is definitely a solid album, even if it isn't great or particularly remarkable in anyway.  Certainly, it's the weakest of Megadeth's actual thrash albums, but it's got a somewhat different, more melodic and speed metalish sound, and is actually a bit more consistent than their previous two albums. (Though this is partially because it just doesn't have anything as mindblowingly awesome as 'Looking Down the Cross' or 'Black Friday' or the two previous title tracks.  But, it's all pretty good.<br /><br />Keeping their trend of short albums, SFSGSW has only 8 tracks, and lasts not too much more than a half an hour.  Fortunately, there aren't any real throwaway tracks.  \\"Into the Lungs of Hell' is an instrumental, always a nice thing to hear.  The riffs aren't too exciting, but it's got some solid leadwork.  A good opener.  'Set the World Afire' is the most all out thrashy track here.  It lacks any sort of vocal hooks, but it riffs it up pretty well.  I ain't a Sex Pistols fan, but the 'Anarchy in the UK' works quite well, providing a nice, simple and catchy track.  'Mary Jane' is a bit weirder, less riff-oriented and more atmospheric.  It took a while to grow on me, but it's pretty solid.  '502' may be my favorite track here.  It's more punkish speed-metal than thrash, but it's fun and energetic with some very nice leadwork.  'In My Darkest Hour' is one of the few ballads Mustaine wrote in the early days, and it's quite good.  Strangely enough, this song is most memorable for it's riffwork, though he pulls off the vox a bit better than you might imagine.  'Liar' is the fastest, most unrelenting track here.  The middle vocal section is just great.  'Hook in Mouth' is a decent closer, but nothing remarkable.  Decent riffs, subpar vox.  Still works well enough overall, however.<br /><br />Yeah, this is just solid thrash album.  Nothing much that you haven't heard before, but it gets the job done.one.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I heard about it being like the old school \\"rock operas\\", so I was a bit worried it wouldn't be all that good, but it's great! The longer tracks: Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming, probably the more unique of the tracks on the cd are good with a lot of variation. Definitely a different, unique style for Green Day. I just wish I could get an edited version from Wal-Mart or online. Anyone know why Green Day doesn't let their cd be edited?
B000000WA4|5.0|I remember seeing the Pumpkins in 1996. This was at their peak musically. This album was great at the time and is still amazing. Every song on disc one is great. After 1996 they definately started going downhill.
B00005QJDG|5.0|Wow, this may be Dream Theater's best live album. From the opening D chord of Regression (gets me every time) to LaBrie's comment on the length, this concert does not once let you go. <br /> <br />First of all, the performance of Metropolis, Pt. 2 may be the best one, maybe even better than the studio album because of things like the choir in The Spirit Carries On and the changed ending to Finally Free. The energy in this version seems so much stronger than in the studio album, and is just amazing overall.  <br /> <br />Every member of the band is at their strongest here. Everybody seems to hate LaBrie's voice, but I can tolerate it, and I've heard him do much worse live on songs like The Mirror and Voices. <br /> <br />The second disc starts off (not literally, but it should be considered the beginning) with a flawless, beautiful performance of Metropolis, Pt. 1. LaBrie's 'banter' is not forgettable, I think it actually gives the whole thing a sense of pace, something rarely found on live albums. Plus, Jordan Rudess's keyboard improv in the background is worth it, even if LaBrie started talking about something entirely different. <br /> <br />The Mirror is one of my favorite Dream Theater songs, and here, the band did not disappoint. Though they didn't segue into Lie, they did include a part of it at the end which I really enjoyed. <br /> <br />Just Let Me Breathe is a song I hadn't heard until buying this album, and from this performance it sounds pretty cool, and gave the concert a lot of energy. The song then segues into Acid Rain, another song I hadn't heard before, an amazing instrumental that makes me want to go get Liquid Tension Experiment right now. <br /> <br />Caught in a New Millennium is a mix-up of two songs (Caught in a Web and New Millennium), and it was carried out very well, even though it goes a little slow in the beginning. Caught in a Web is another of my favorite songs, and this was a great performance of the song. <br /> <br />What needs to be said about Another Day? It's an amazing song, with an equally amazing live performance. Jordan Rudess's keyboard solo that follows is great, but it only seems good for a transition to disc 3, the best of all the discs. <br /> <br />The final hour of the concert begins with the opening organ intro to A Mind Beside Itself, one of Dream Theater's best songs. Each song is carried out flawlessly, and the improvisation on The Silent Man from each member of the band is nothing short of astounding. One of the best moments on the whole set. <br /> <br />Now, probably the climax of it all, Learning to Live, one of Dream Theater's best songs. Not only is the performance of this song perfect, but the improvisation on this one is especially amazing. Now, if only I had the DVD so I could actually watch it. <br /> <br />For the encore, probably yet another of their best songs ever, A Change of Seasons is performed to finish out this grand finale of a third disc. I'm very glad this song was included in it's entirety instead of split apart and put into different parts of the concert. From beginning to end, this performance is almost as hard-hitting as the perfect studio version, and provides for a very nice ending. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an unforgettable set. One thing that makes it so memorable is it's longevity, and the fact that it never once gets boring over the three discs that this set spans. If you are a fan of Dream Theater, buy this right now if you do not own it already. This isn't a good start for people just finding out about the band, and it's advised that you go listen to Scenes from a Memory and some of their other albums first.
B000667FN8|4.0|I actually like this band. My friends laugh at me, but hey who cares. This band isn't exactly breaking new ground musically or creating any revolution but they are fun and thats what I like about them.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I'm 56 years old and I don't think I've ever heard an album that blew me away like \\"X&Y.\\" I loved \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" also, but the new one is killer, song after song...no words to describe. Just when you think you've heard it all, something like this comes along, so extraordinary. Thanks Chris Martin and the Coldplay band.   June 4, 2008: Just to update, it's been nearly three years since this album was released. I would now say it is my favorite recording ever, which is hyperbole, I know, but I never get tired of listening to X&Y. I just love it. I haven't anticipated the release of a new album (Viva La Vida) with such enthusiasm since the early 70's.
B000060P79|4.0|This album is good. I'm not sure if this is better then their second album. Not ground breaking music but it is good. Simple plan is a fun band that don't take themselves seriously and that is why they will last.
B00004RFFI|1.0|ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES OF ALL TIME.<br /><br />Tornados and humans chasing after each other... it quickly becomes clear that the tornados are actually more intelligent than the humans.<br /><br />At least PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE was so stupid you could laugh at it.  This movie is simply pathetic - save for the \\"flying cow\\" scene, there isn't even anything to laugh at.<br /><br />Total rubbish.  I find it amazing that Michael Crichton had anything to do with this bomb; supposedely he co-wrote it with his then-fourth-wife - he probably let her write this stinker, and just put his name on it.
B000000WJZ|5.0|MELLON COLLIE AND THE INFINITE SADNESS IS BETTER. IT WAS THEIR MUSICAL PEAK. I REMEMBER WHEN THEY PLAYED MADISON SQUARE GARDEN IN 1996. AFTER THAT YEAR THEY WENT DOWNHILL. THIS ALBUM IS GREAT BUT MELLON COLLIE IS A LOT BETTER.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|MTV has struck again.  The camera is choppy, hand held, cut from character to character to scene to scene, and accelerate through the drug deals.  It's hard to care about these characters because their problems are thrown against the wall as if Jackson Pollack were splashing paint.  Sure, they all get addicted to what?  Looks like coke, but has effect of crystal meth, but could be heroin, except they get frantic like coke or meth.  I surmise the director doesn't care about the detail, just the effect.  Diet pills are notorious for the consequence of the amphetamine.  An old Jewish lady getting crazy on speed, that takes some chutzpah all right.    The sex scene with Jennifer Connelly, her performance with a device and another prostitute, there's something not true about her in that scene. I'm sure there's a lot of drug addict girls that will do anything for a high, but darn it, none of the junkies in this film are emaciated enough.    Ellen Burstyn  is an exception in her role I think.  She certainly acted crazy enough.  If my refrigerator asked me to feed it, I'd be in Bedlam too.  She deserved her Academy Award nomination, but being a cynic, I wonder if all the actors that got awards for acting crazy, I wonder if it is so hard to act crazy?

B000002H97|4.0|Metallica's 1991 self titled album, famously known as The Black Album, is one of the highlight albums of the 90's.  <br /> <br />This album was one of those that I listened to constantly when I was younger. Listening to the songs again today, I get this creepy nostalgic feeling that bring back many memories: the hard rocking Enter Sandman, Sad But True, and the outrageous Wherever I May Roam are just some elements of the heavy material that Metallica is known for presented here, but there's the surprising turn on The Unforgiven, an epic metal classic that sways and tingles as it switches from one chord to another (the song also produced a heartbreaking and memorable video as well), the wonderful ballad Nothing Else Matters which is, in my opinion, one of the best songs ever written. <br /> <br />Metallica might have sold out in the late 90's with haircuts, designer clothes and the whole Napster incident, but somehow The Black Album still shines in its own dark way! <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B+
0930289455|5.0|a Perfect tale of laughter, and saddness.  The Killing Joke is one of the few origen storys that made the character more developed and still keep the same greatness that makes a character such as the Joker still really cool.  The story is dark and very powerful, moving at times and makes you think about just what is it that makes a man a Figure head of crime in Gothem City.  It does a amazing job at telling the Jokers past with still that hint of \\"Is it REALLY what happened?\\"  If you ask me it is one of the best origen storys I have ever read.  The Art work is amazing, the story is perfect, it turly is a moment in Batman History anyone would be happy to have read, and by the end of the story you will have a new found respect for the Crawned Prince of Comedy with a ending that will have you saying \\"Perfect\\" once your done.  If you are not a Fan of Batman then this is one of the best Comics to read to get you into it.
B000005ALN|4.0|George Michael is a veteran pop star who survived the 80's well into the 90's, and here's the proof to it. <br /> <br />Released in 1996, Older shows Michael as a matured songwriter and musician. The intelligent Jesus To A Child, the first single released, is an underrated masterpiece. The sultry dance track Fast Love, another single which charted pretty well on both sides of the Atlantic, is one song that shouldn't be missed on a George Michael greatest hits compilation. Then there's the groovy hit single Spinning The Wheel, the passionate It Doesn't Really Matter, the tingling The Strangest Thing, and the poppy crooner Star People. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B
B00008S2VG|4.0|Reading through all of these negative reviews, I couldn't help but feel like I needed to make a defense for Madonna. It's certainly true that American Life is not your mainstream pop music, and that is perhaps why it did not succeed very well on the charts - relatively - even though it was number one when it debuted.<br /><br />Personally, I believe that all these people who claim to have lost interest in Madonna and saying she is \\"washed up\\" are just using that excuse as a cover up to hide the fact they don't understand her anymore. Madonna writes (or co-writes) and produces all of her own music (with the excepton of some of her earlier material, such as the Like a Virgin album, which if you ask me is overrated anyway) and says what she genuinely feels, not what she thinks people want to hear necessarily.<br /><br />While in recent years she has been overshadowed by younger female \\"singers,\\" do these up-and-comers really have anything to \\"say\\"? No, they don't. They just sit there looking pretty while the music is manufactured for them. Madonna tells stories and shares viewpoints on every subject important to her and her lyrics are often so introspective and thoughtful people don't want to face them. They just want a catchy tune they can hum along to.<br /><br />I admit the music on American Life is often choppy and the album as a coherent piece is more than a little uneven, but each individual song is well-crafted and brilliant in and of itself. If we go deeper and examine her lyrics, this is probably one of the most profound works of art available. I'm not surprised that all those consumers who prefer pop tarts singing about how bad they want a boy or how hot they look while dancing in the club dismissed this record, but it's their loss. I don't mean to criticize anyone for their personal tatses, but I am strongly encouraging people to peel away the layers of American Life and examine it from every angle in light of what they might have heard about it. You may just be surprised.t be surprised.
B000002KIE|4.0|This was a very good band who very well could have been great if not for poor/arrogant management and their own life style. If you want some hard rock with a different slant you might want to give this one a try. This band defined punk in the late 70's. In my opinion the greatest punk band of all.
B00009MGR6|4.0|this album is good,(not better than \\"flick of the switch\\" or \\"fly on the wall\\" though.)Everyone says that the best song is \\"HEATSEEKER\\",well,let me tell you something...IT'S NOT!!that song sucks!The highlights of the album are\\"THATS THE WAY I WANNA ROCK'N'ROLL\\",\\"GO ZONE\\",\\"KISSIN' DYNAMITE\\",\\"THIS MEANS WAR\\",\\"TWO'S UP\\",and my favorite\\"SOME SIN FOR NOTHIN'\\" <br />    i would recomend this album to people who have \\"Fly on the wall\\"and\\"Flick of the switch\\",that way its easier to accept.This album takes a little getting used to,so if you have it,but hate it,take time listening to it once and a while.
1400032717|2.0|I was pretty disappointed by this book.  The back cover makes it sound like a story that is absolutely nothing like the story is about.  The main plot really has nothing to do with the dog, and not to sound offensive, but reading a book with an autistic narrotor is enough to give me a headache.  There are so many added on random thoughts that it distracts from the flow of the story, and I ended up skippin to the ends of chapters.  Had I known what I was getting myself into by reading it, I wouldn't have picked it up.  Although if I was doing a study on autism, it would be a good book for perspective on it.
B00005JLKB|5.0|The first season begins with the mystery that is Clark Kent and not even Clark knows his future, but throughout the series there are clues and clever lines, which link the present and the future of our favorite Kansas farmboy. Clark and Lex's secretive frienship will one day lead to issues of trust and betrayal. Clark must get a handle on his abilities, if he is to become a true hero, and if he is ever to become the \\"man of tomorrow.\\"    The episodes are well structured with relevant situations between characters. When Clark develops his X-Ray ability, Lana finds her mother's letter and feels as if she's reading her own words. She then tells Clark that she feels like her mother could see right through her. In \\"Hourglass\\" Clark meets a woman blinded by the meteor shower, who has gained the ability to see the fate of people with her touch. Clark's is filled with an endless graveyard, whereas Lex will become President and one day destroy the world. Fate is against them...    The DVD transfer is what I'd consider to be low-def. The colors and quality are not that of the following seasons, but that won't matter much if you enjoy the show.
0802136834|5.0|I find myself wanting to know the detailed accounts of historical figures, and then finding the process of reading the account a painful laborous process. <br /> <br />No so with this book, the author is to be well congratulated for tackling such a well known figure, and also such a complex tale with aplomb.  I've tried to read other authors on the same subjects, but this book is so well written that I haven't found it's equal. <br /> <br />Through letters, journals and personal accounts, she takes us back into time, and makes these men and woman live for us again. Don't let the sheer volume of this book intimidate you! It has a lot to say, look forward to the journey.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Let me begin by saying that anyone who did not give this CD five stars doesn't deserve to listen to it!  It is absolutely amazing!  I didn't think they would ever make an album better than Rush of Blood to the Head, but ladies and gentlemen, they have, or certainly every bit as good.  There's not one song on X&Y that couldn't have been released as their first single, and how will they choose their second single?  I suppose the only criticism one could make is that the songs are too catchy, or that the lyrics don't pack as much punch, but the quality of the music is extraordinary!
B00005JNBQ|3.0|I'll be honest.  I watched this movie a couple weeks back and still can't decide what to make of it.  It is such a different type of movie that you can't really place it in a certain category of movies.  It's almost like watch a funny documentary about an event which you know nothing about.  Being a college student I had been subjected to hearing a lot of quotes from this movie.  I had to watch it out of survival.  Now people are telling me that you really don't get it until you watch it a second time.  I'm not sure if I'm ready for that step yet.  Actually I'm not really sure that there is really anything to get.  I will probably try and find out.  I wouldn't advise buying this movie.  Most people have seen it and I don't think it is one you will want to watch all that frequently.  My advice is to rent or buy it used after all the movie stores get rid of their hundreds of \\"guaranteed in stock\\" copies.
0792107683|5.0|Alan Ladd starred in one of the most spare and beautiful westerns ever captured on film in George Stevens' portrait of a lonely gunfighter and the bond he forms with a family of homesteaders under seige out west. Jack Schaefer's very good western novella was lofted to greatness by Ladd's quiet performance as the gunfighter Shane, who gets a glimpse of the life he would have preferred rather than the hand he was dealt.<br /><br />A story and film which sounds simple, and is often described as such, is really anything but, its complexity hidden by its scope and the subtle manner in which it is told. Shane is the mythic figure, riding in on the horizon and staying to help a family fend off a rancher trying to drive the farmers off their land. It is a story of changing times and complex relationships.<br /><br />Shane forms a bond with farmer Van Heflin and becomes his friend because of his decency and acceptance of Shane, even though Shane's gun and his readiness to draw at the slightest sound reveals a past and a way of life Shane would like to live down. Shane knows he is on the way out as the west changes and it is ironic that he chooses to help the family trying to build a town and a community, the very things that will be his demise.<br /><br />Brandon De Wilde is excellent as the young boy who needs a larger than life hero to look up to and finds him in Shane. As he and Shane form a bond, an inevitable confrontation between a deadly gunfighter hired to get rid of the homesteaders will force him to put on his gun and live up to everything the young boy feels in his heart for Shane.<br /><br />Jean Arthur gives a wonderful and often overlooked performance as the wife who loves her husband and son dearly, but can not deny the feelings she has for Shane. There is a point in the film where she tells her husband to just hold her and not ask any questions; everyone who has been watching knows why she does this. It is a platonic love for Shane she would never act on but it is still there.<br /><br />Heflin is also excellent as a solid man trying to hold the other farmers together even as a deadly gunfighter in black, symbolic of the good verses evil of the story, kills one of their own. He is no fool and senses the feelings between his wife and Shane, but knows that neither would ever betray him; Arthur because she loves him and Shane because it is not the kind of man he is.<br /><br />Shane's feelings for Arthur are not the threatening kind, but more a loneliness when he looks at her, as she represents everything he wanted but knows he will never have because he is a gunfighter. He tells Arthur that a gun is just a tool like an axe or a shovel, no better or worse than the man who carries it. We know Shane is the good man, and Jack Palance the bad man, quick on the draw and evil, but no match for the soft spoken but deadly Shane.<br /><br />The way the inevitable gunfight comes about and the way this film ends continues the larger than life myth of the American gunfighter. There is a nice score from Victor Young and good support from Edgar Buchanan as a farmer and Ben Johnson as a rancher who changes his spots, won over by the kind of man Shane shows himself to be.<br /><br />Shane is not only one of the great westerns, but one of the best films of any genre. It is an artistic portrait of a gunfighter and the changing landscape of the American west, as general stores and churches began to replace the lawlessness that had been settled by a fast and accurate draw for so many years.<br /><br />If you do not own Shane, your film library is incomplete. Every serious film buff has a spot for this masterpiece on their shelf somewhere.

B00003CXA6|5.0|This is the best Civil War movie I've ever seen. The story line is clear. It depicts the characters as human beings with human shortcomings and human determination. It shows how small accidents of history can lead to major turning points. It even <br />shows that Robert E. Lee-a previously sacred icon-may have had  the ability to misjudge and miscalculate. Battle scenes were incredible. Locations fabulous.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Maybe it just me, but does anyone else notice that Elton John's masterpiece, Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, is alays left off his greatest hits. WWWWHHHHYYYY???????!!!! I thought maybe on his two-disc collection they would have it, but nope, you won't find it here. Also Empty Garden, for John Lennon, is not present. Such a great performance that almost brought tears to my eyes. If you don't believe me, listen to both songs and ask yourself why they aren't on his greatest hits collection. Because the rest of the album is fabulous, it still receives a four. 4and1/2 if you get the extra 3rd disc. Plenty of space to add two great songs, though.
0671027344|5.0|It's labeled as a Teen book though I think most people can understand what it's like going through high school. It's a very interesting book and I can definitely relate, though I remember spending all my time studying in high school and not actually having a social life. I really enjoyed this book. It's written in a series of letters by a freshman in high school to a person he doesn't actually know, but has heard is a good person \\"who listens and understands and doesn't try to sleep with that person at the party\\" that they could have. That phrase is actually repeated a few times throughout the book, and I find it kind of cutely innocent. Well, this high school kid has a teacher who's always giving him books to read and write essays about, extra work since he thinks he's very gifted. But that's not what the book is all about, it seems to focus more on the relationships between his family and friends. It does seem like it is written by a teenager, which makes it easy to understand and probably more interesting.
B00000DGUY|4.0|Counting their live albums, Dire Straits has only 8 albums, and they could probably fit on 4 albums, five at the most, to make a great box set. Dire Straits is an excellent and very talented group, and I bet their box set would sell. As for their greatest hits, it is missing many songs, and the editing is BS, but for a casual fan who has heard Sultans of Swing, Money for Nothing, So Far Away, and Walk of Life on the radio and knows nothing else, this is a good start. It just leaves them wanting more, like a BOX SET!
B00008OWZC|5.0|When I was going to University in England on study-abroad as a teen, I happened upon a kiosk selling bootlegs, and got a two-tape Led Zeppelin bootleg.  As far as I can tell, it may have been comprised of one of these shows, as it certainly sounded like it was off the soundboard, and it certainly wasn't the later Song Remains the Same soundtrack.  Unfortunately, it was a tape, and it either got chewed up or left behind in one of the many moves in that period of my life.  Pity, I'd like to know if it was the same shows I was listening to back then that I hear now in these recordings, because I remember thinking back then, the world really deserved to hear a concert like THAT to represent Led Zeppelin live.  Now we have it, on CD, cleaned up and mastered and showing the band in all its glory.     Some people like the whole stretched-out 70's live rock stadium extravaganza, and others want to hear their songs as close to how they're played on record as possible and then go home.  This disc is a record of 70's stadium rock at both its best and most bombastic, excessive, and pretentious. If you're into that sort of thing (I certainly am) its a must-have collection.    These CD's show why the band made a wise move in disbanding after Bonham's death.  He was an absolute monster on the skins.  His swing would start at the corner and stretch all the way around the block, and STILL be coming at you.  Its his drumming that anchors Zeppelin as we know it.  JPJ is a solid, dependable bassic, and he does the wise thing of fitting right in on the bottom end and holding his own, while Page pummels us with his guitar riffing.  Yes, the excessiveness of Page's playing often shows his technical limitations and sloppiness, but like many great 70's acts, you have to remember, he was writing the book of tricks that so many bands nowadays simply use to write music-by-numbers.  This guy was reckless, experimental, and creative as hell, and that's something, at its best, that comes throughin spades.  Plant's voice holds its own and then some.  He's not hamming it up like he did for Song Remains the Same, and it doesn't sound like he's stretching as hard as he might have been if he knew these soundtracks would be released world-wide years later.  But that makes this performance more honest, in that you get to experience what it might have been like to be in the audience for a couple great Led Zeppelin shows.  In a word-awesome.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I haven't loved a band this much since Alkaline Trio, (pre Good Mourning). My Chemical Romance is brilliant, and Gerard Way is an amazing front man. I found myself watching the video for \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\", over and over... I was simply captivated. Alot of people have critised My Chemical Romance for their appearance or over-the-top preformances, and I would like to point out that My Chemical Romance ARE in fact, preformers. The make up, the way that Gerard sings, it's all the part of the act, and all for your entertainment, don't take it so seriously! <br /> <br />Anyway, besides that, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge is a great CD. Listen to all the negative reviews... if this CD has pissed so many people off, and apparently made them feel pretty threatened, from what I can gather, there must be something in it, right?  <br /> <br />Buy Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge and support My Chemical Romance, and amazing band.
B00005NB0H|5.0|I had the original Live at Leeds disc, and I always enjoyed putting it on to hear the power of the Who in concert.  I didn't even know this version existed until recently when I was thumbing through the local record store and found it.  I finally went back and bought it. <br /> <br />I like the way the recording has been cleaned up (the *pops* and such are gone)and expanded to include two disc's worth of material.  Disc One is superb.  Disc Two, with the rendition of \\"Tommy\\" is well worth owning for hearing that the Who could pull off their rock opera in entirety in concert.  Yes, Tommy is pretentious (listen to Pete's long-winded introduction, when he calls it \\"Thomas\\"), but given the youth and naivety of the band members of the time, its energy and creativity overshadows its foolishness.  There's great playing across both discs, and while I'm not a hardcore Who fan (I have several recordings, but haven't seen them live or delved deep into their backgrouds), I would think anyone more than a casual fan would do well to add this collection to their library.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Watching this musical and person and listening to the CD are two different stories. The musical is so great because it is such a sight to see, unbelievable voices, acting, and pit, and it is like a whole cut out into another world of magic. The only way to describe this musical is magical, it will definitely go down in history as one of the greatest musicals ever. It's overwhelming popularity is already sweeping the world! The soundtrack is great, definitely well worth the money. However more expensive, I strongly suggest buying tickets as opposed to buying the CD first. It is worth any amount of money, any person who does not love this musical, doesn't have a heart. As a NY Times Critic said, \\"If all musicals had the heart, brains, and courage of Wicked, Broadway would be a better place.\\"
0887306667|4.0|Similar to many of Ries's other books, this book explains many solid marketing concepts through many well-known, albeit one-sided, examples.  I would recommend it since it's short and only takes about an hour or two to read.

1850899029|5.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Handi-read) by Roald Dahl is one of my favorite books of all time and tells the adventures of Charlie Bucket and the time he visited Mr. Willy Wonkas chocolate factory. This is an awesome tale that teaches children morals and values without beating them over the head. Reading the story as an adult I can not truly see the hardship that Charlie has to suffer prior to coming to the factory and this is in itself is the hallmark of inteligent social commentary. I love the story and the illustrations and I consider this one of the better childrens stories of all time that can be read from ages 6-99.

0393324818|5.0|Great book, can't believe I waited a couple years to read it!  Especially valuable is the afterwords with the nonsense from the \\"club\\" - sportscasters (e.g. Joe MOrgan), pundits (like the Toronto press who tried to make a racial issue out of J.

B0002W4SWC|2.0|There really ought to be a law against screenwriters who suck the life out of literary characters. If there were, the culprits behind the screenplay for \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" would be languishing in the deepest, foulest crud-filled dungeon holes imaginable. Helen Fielding, one of the three screenwriters, must have been held captive and tortured. Only that would explain her participation in this literary travesty.<br /><br />To have transformed Bridgett's mother -- narcissistic, flighty and imperturbable - into a weepy, sad little housewife is incomprehensible, never mind unforgivable. To give Daniel Cleaver - unrepentant rogue and scoundrel - any hint of sympathy is idiotic and wrong. To add a fight scene - complete with a plunge through a plate glass window! - is positively imbecilic. This is London, sod it, not the bloody Wild West!<br /><br />And poor Bridget, denuded of her obsessive charm, her wry perceptiveness and her fascination with pop culture...shocking!<br /><br />The result is a bleached out, watered down and thoroughly stomach-churning translation of a cast of funny, silly and thoroughly contemporary characters into the blandest and most tepid of leftover puddings.<br /><br />There's only one remedy: READ THE BOOK!
B00005JNTX|5.0|Going into the spring of 2005, Sin City quickly became the most anticipated film....well, really the only greatly anticipated movie of a rather dull spring movie season. This was not without good cause; in making Sin City directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller were attempting to do something which had never even been thought of up to this point; to make a direct comic book translation. Not an adaptation, a translation. A translation of page to screen. Going in, of course, there were some doubts about whether this could even be done. Well, I'm glad to say, Rodriguez and Miller triumphed in their revolutionary task. Sin City is everything it could be, and maybe a bit more. <br /> <br />But before all of that. Before the springtime hype of Sin City...I had already jumped the bandwagon. Several months before, actually. All the way back to the late summer of 2004 when Sin City's director Robert Rodriguez released an 8-minute preview of his film. It was, in short, utterly fantastic. The tone was unbelievably pulpy, the cinematography revolutionary, and the acting almost classic. As if this film were shot in the 40s or 50s rather than the current day. As a avid fan of Film Noir these were all very, very good signs for me. <br /> <br />Of course, having been introduced to this...genius, really, I immediately ran out and purchased one of the many graphic novels Sin City is based on; The Hard Goodbye. Frankly, it was the best comic book I ever read. Still is. The combination of gritty, noir-to-the-max storytelling, and stark back and white art was simply mind-blowing. Just as the film that would proceed it, The Hard Goodbye was groundbreaking, and just plain damn good. Sin City was now one of my most anticipated films of 2005, if not the most anticipated. <br /> <br />But, as a cruel twist of fate would have it, just as Sin City was FINALLY being released theatrically, I came down with a rather nasty cold, which prevented me from seeing it for almost 2 weeks. When I finally recovered however, and made it to my local theater to see what I just knew would be a masterpiece, I was...to put it bluntly, a bit let down. I loved the opening short-story, which I had already seen thanks to the 2004 preview, as well as the first story of Marv, and The Hard Goodbye. But sadly, the other two tales The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard seemed very hollow, too fast-paced, and even a bit pointless. <br /> <br />At first, I chalked this up to over-hype on my part. Raising my expectations too high. Then, later, I realized the true cause; while I had read The Hard Goodbye, I had not yet explored the other two adapted novels. This knowledge, and experience, of the source, is quite key I believe to fully...realizing Sin City's greatness. Having now read both of the other books, and seen Sin City the film again, I can confirmed that is true...for me at least. I am now able to enjoy Sin City to its fullest. So now moving past my problems of pre-conceived notions and lack of knowledge for the source material, I can deliver my \\"true\\" review of Sin City. <br /> <br />The three stories which make up Sin City, obviously, are all similar in plot and tone. It's all about revenge and violence. And it's hammered at you fast and often. Due to the whole method of direct translation, the pacing is quick, but enjoyable. We are almost whisked through scene after scene, story after story. As our lead character(s) deliver hard-boiled monologues to tie it all together. This pacing also allows for excellent \\"rewatchability\\" factor. The two hours goes by quickly, and you'll never mind popping it into the DVD player as often as possible. The violence in the film is, as you probably have heard, gratuitous and sometimes grotesque. However it all takes on a very cartoony-feel as characters survive impossible psychical torment and pain. Getting hit in the face with a sledgehammer or getting hit by a car means nothing in Sin City, and our heroes (or villains) come out of itwith barely a scratch. Even the more serious injuries inflicted (such as a two castration), is done in such a way that makes it seems, as crazy as it sounds, a bit less brutal than the stuff we usually see in violence-ridden films. <br /> <br />Save for a hammy and unbelievably over-the-top Michael Madsen (which I won't go into), nearly all of the performances in Sin City are first rate. Some even bordering on the spectacular. One of these, is the film's undoubtable star, Mickey Rourk as the brutish Marv. His performance is both mean and nasty. But, oddly...likeable. In his writings creator Frank Miller injected Marv with a large amount of solemn dignity and empathy, and Rourk brings this to life beautifully. Marv's a bad guy. But a bad guy with good intentions, and a good heart. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Nick Stahl, Jessica Alba and rest of the All-Star cast all give noticeable strong performances. Even Elijah Wood's silent role as the mute cannibal Kevin is excellent in an eery and villainous tone. <br /> <br />The score of the film is impressive as well. Written by Rodriguez himself, it's an excellent collection of classic bass lines, and horn pieces adding to the cult tone of the film. <br /> <br />Of course, if you're talking about Sin City, you have to talk about the visuals and CGI. These are both done excellently. The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen. From it's comic book originated shot selection and angles, to its stark black, white and silver palate, Sin City is truly art brought to life, and its truly a pleasure to view and watch. The CGI, while nothing groundbreaking, is near perfectly blended with live actors and sets, to really bring alive this city of corruption and crime. But the best feature of the CGI would have to be its overall ambiguity. Except for a bad animation here or there, it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb, which should assure this film will stand the test of time and technological advances. <br /> <br />The movie obviously isn't for everyone. Some may very well me turned away, or even disgusted with the violence and bleak resolution of the film. But for fans of the genre, like myself, Sin City is just about as perfect as any film could hope to be. Despite a flaw or two inherent in this type of translation, the director, writer, and actors all play their parts perfectly in not only bring the comic book to the screen, but bring the screen back to comic books.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|Happy movies are all too rare these days. A film without aliens, explosions, infidelity car chases - or better yet, all four - is the exception. \\"Shall We Dance?\\" fills the bill rather nicely.<br /><br />The story concerns John Clark (Richard Gere), a happily married lawyer who guiltily turns to ballroom dancing to relieve the monotony of an unvarying routine. He is captivated by sullenly-beautiful Paulina, a dance instructor and ballroom competitor for whom dancing has lost its luster. A lesser film would have had the two find happiness together. But is film is too light-hearted to fall back on that clich&eacute;d plotline. Instead, Clark and Paulina and a varied cast of kooky-but-realistic characters find friendship and transformation through dance.<br /><br />The movie is never too predictable, and there are some tense moments, especially when Clark's wife Beverly thinks her husband's frequent late nights are due to his having an affair. Stanley Tucci, as the straight corporate lawyer with a taste for sequins and the cha-cha, is terrific - by turns cocky and crestfallen.<br /><br />\\"Shall We Dance?\\" is a trifle, but a thoroughly enjoyable one, with beautiful dancing, engaging characters and (I'm not giving anything away, here) a funny and happy ending for all.

B0008KLVG4|3.0|Steven Spielberg's groundbreaking blockbuster about a killer great white shark loose on the beaches of a small summer tourist community is still one of the most terrifying experiences in cinema. While not necessarily classified as a \\"horror film\\", this white-knuckle thriller has kept beach-goers out of the water for nearly three decades now. Despite a handful of mediocre sequels and countless knock-offs, \\"Jaws\\" is still the measuring stick in underwater excitement. The 30th Anniversary Edition DVD, however, is hardly worth the upgrade. You're getting the \\"Making Of Jaws\\" documentary in its entirety (it was cut down for 2000's original DVD) and a few added scenes in the outtake reel. There's still no audio commentary, no theatrical trailers, and nothing on here that was actually recorded specifically for this edition though there is a sixty-page photo journal included. If you don't already own this amazing movie on DVD, it's worth the money but if you already bought the previous DVD edition, it's hardly worth trading up for.
0679720200|4.0|<br />This chilling, first-person account of a man who struggles with his sense of guilt and innocence (and indifference) probably defines the existential novel. \\"The Stranger\\" is a small, bare story about big feelings in our complex world.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|Good timing on the cameras for these events! After an indulgent decade following their hit success, we see Metallica's impetus has come a grinding halt, egos are out of control, and it appears the rock 'n' roll dream is cursed, as ever.    So what's it like to live in a bubble? How's it feel to rattle your brain with alcohol and loud music for just a little too long? How do you still care about anything beyond your sanity and family, and where does that leave music and how you feel it? This film explores all that.    So we watch what happens... The band members are so neurotic and defensive that they almost have to speak in a code... every word becomes so loaded that these grown men can't cope, they can't get beyond irritations that control their wild moods.    That irritation affects us too. You want to just YELL at them to get over their personal B-S and work on the music, to believe in the music, to use their imagination, talent and opportunity to create monstrous music. It is all pretty far from them in a sense, I guess... in their artificial world, the one WE create around them with adulation and endless money... the music is oddly less meaningful. The words of the songs are hasty improvisations drawn from personal issues, inner-focused to the extreme.    Musically, while creating ST ANGER Metallica seem desperate to \\"make something that sounds like something\\" rather than a record in the classical sense. I should explain. These guys are in personal chaos. There is no driving force of hungry vision compelling them to put down brilliant tracks over a few weeks. So there is a lot of distracted dragging around in makeshift studios, randomly trying out ideas and snipping together arrangements, and then they have these endless defensive analytical discussions. It really is incredible. They don't come in with songs or anything real to say, they more or less just blast out random riffs, have engineers tinker with it, and tack on some facile meaning later. Not to take away anything from ST ANGER  but it sure looks as if the music was just incidental, a by-product of their hanging out and therapy while wrapped up in their arms-crossed, insular little worlds. It's just astounding to watch because the way they work is bizzarely inefficient. It's like here's another successful band in total entropy, the story of rock and roll - a self-fulfilling clich. Metallica's ST. ANGER does carry a bit of a \\"whatever\\" quality to it, a whiff of their not being sure of where they are and what they want to do. This is a totally honest statement for them.    I can recognize some of the band's human follies in myself and this film has surprising introspective value. Any one of us could be in the same weirded-out state James Hetfield seems to veer into, in the right circumstance - that's our humanity right there. Money eats people I guess - you can always pay people to comply to your demands. I recommend this film highly for what it is - whether or not there may be better or more relevant things to watch on DVD.
B0006L16N8|5.0|After listening to the CD for the 3rd time, I concluded this album is as good as, or better than the other two. I paid close attention to \\"Fix You\\" and realized how beautiful this song is; lyrics, melody, arrangements. I dedicated this song to my son...and I have never done that before. Whoever mixed and/or produced the tracks on this CD did a fantastic job. Chris' distinct, crisp voice rises above the instruments and lets you hear the words while that signature guitar of theirs...gently weeps, to quote George. I know \\"Twisted Logic\\" is my least favorite but I can't choose a favorite. I find myself torn between \\"Fix You\\", \\"Talk\\", \\"X&Y\\", \\"Swalloed by the Sea\\" and the hidden track \\"Till Kingdom Comes\\". I haven't been so excited about a new album by anybody, in a long time.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|It's not the worst movie I've ever see but it certainly is a runner up. I hated everything about this movie. From the look of it to the sound of it. It couldn't have ended any sooner for me. Horrible.
B00000IFP6|3.0|First off.. it's true that Zinman brings a refreshing speed to these familiar pieces and they work most of the time.  It's rather strange to hear Symphony No. 5 at such breakneck speed initially.. but you really do get used to it and may even prefer it after awhile.  My biggest constructive criticism for this set (hence the 3/5 stars) is the sound quality.  It's plain flat and dimensionless.  I own lots of classical recordings, especially ones from Telarc and even some older ones, and I wish this boxset came close to those recordings.  It's a shame because the flatness and lack of presence and space of the Zinman recordings betray the otherwise good performances.  3/5 stars.
0441003257|5.0|Who would believe that the Apolcalypse could be so funny? I bought this book for my son because he was such a Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett fan.

I don't think I have ever laughed so hard while reading a book. What a pleasure it was.  <br /> <br />If you love to read books that make you laugh and think, start early in the morning. You won't be able to put this one down.

0767836324|5.0|I thought this movie was VERY interesting, picking up where Peter Pan left off.  At one point in the movie Wendy is reading from the actual Peter Pan book that J.M. Barrie wrote.  I'm wondering if J.M. Barrie had anything to do with the writing of this movie as well.<br /><br />Even though this movie has a message that fathers should spend more time with their family, it doesn't really get in the way.  The movie is still adventurous and actually gives you the feeling that Neverland is a real place.<br /><br />I really like the scene where they have the imaginary feast.  When Peter actually sees the food in front of him, it really is wonderful.  I think that scene pretty much sums up this whole movie.<br /><br />I swear, if J.M. Barrie didn't write this, I'd like to know who did.  They must have been pretty darn talented, because this movie is great.  I think it's as good or better than any of the Peter Pan films, including the animated Disney one, and classic animated Disney films are tough to beat.  The lost boys in Hook are a lot more wild than the VERY tame lost boys in the animated film, and I think it gives Hook an added sense of realism.<br /><br />This film has a great musical score too.  Obviously, since it's by John Williams.  Although John Williams did do the score for Daddy-o also, which wasn't all that great.<br /><br />Robin Williams delivers another great performance that'll entertain adults and kids alike.  The man has talent, even if in this movie he's old and overweight.<br /><br />I would call Hook a must-see family film.
0312335164|2.0|This is the only Dan Brown novel I've read.  The others MUST be better.  The story line is like a serial comic book..incredible coincidences, one narrow escape after another, fantastic turns of events.  Many characters are billed as super geniuses and yet make moronic mistakes that would be considered stupid for even the average Joe. <br />The \\"science\\" is a little bit of real technology mixed with a lot of half truths and outright garbage.  I think Brown might have intended some kind of statement about government's right to snoop in order to save society, but the message is so muddled that it's impossible to decypher (pun intended).
6302158095|5.0|When I was a kid, I didn't like this movie.  I just didn't understand it.  It was boring.<br /><br />As I grew older though, I realized the power this movie had.  It expresses so much feeling and really gets you to appreciate the arts.<br /><br />Still, I don't really care much for the dancing hippo or drunken Nero animated sequences, even though they're decent.  I like the sequences that don't really tell a story, or only tell parts of stories, much better.<br /><br />The first musical sequence has very random animation that I really love.  It matches the music so closely and it's just great to watch and hear.  Who would have thought you'd have so much fun just seeing specks of light flicker?  The rolling hills leave a lasting impression in my mind too.<br /><br />During the Nutcracker sequence, I only REALLY like the part with the dancing mushrooms.  I'm just amazed at how much the animation matches the music here.<br /><br />The Night on Bald Mountain sequence is absolutely dark and fantastic.  It's rare to see something like this from Disney.  Very, very watchable.<br /><br />My favorite sequence is the one showing the creation of the earth.  The music really gets powerful as the dinosaurs are shown dying of thirst.  It leaves an unforgettable impression in your mind of what it must have felt like to be a poor dinosaur at that time.  I don't think the film makers meant for me to get such an impression, or maybe they did.  In either case, I enjoyed it.  It was very powerful.<br /><br />I don't think a six year old kid will enjoy this very much, but if you like music and art, you can't go wrong with this movie.
B0002IU988|4.0|Having been a casual Creed fan, I was excited to hear of this new band forming.  I was more than pleasantly surprised when I listened to it.  Mark's rocking riffs with Myles' phenomenal voice and the completion of the package with Brian and Scott is wonderful.  I listened to this CD, and only this CD for a month.  I could not bring myself to put anything else in my CD player. These songs are hard rocking, soul searing and well written.  Anyone who buys this CD will not be disappointed.
B000007S5B|4.0|This re-issue of \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" not only sounds better than the first CD edition, it doesn't repeat a glaring mistake.  The initial CD release contained an alternate take of \\"Wintertime Love.\\"  The 1999 CD re-issue features the same version as the original 1968 LP.      \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" was The Doors' third studio album.  It followed \\"The Doors\\" and \\"Strange Days\\" and featured the Number One hit \\"Hello, I Love You.\\"  I enjoy the first six tracks, which made up side one of the LP.  The flamenco guitar on \\"Spanish Caravan\\" was another great demonstration of Robby Krieger's talent.  You can also hear him singing on the song \\"Running Blue\\" from the album \\"The Soft Parade,\\" released by Elektra in 1969.    I still don't understand why \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" was named for a song that doesn't appear on the album.  The song is featured on 1970's \\"Morrison Hotel/Hard Rock Cafe.\\"  \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" still holds its own in the Doors' album catalog.  You'll love it, and love it again.
B000003NA3|2.0|I love jazz, and I love almost all Coltrane, but I'll be honest. I find these shows a bit difficult to listen to.  There's just too much wheezing and squeeling here for my ear.  I find myself whincing at times. Other times it's not seeming to go anywhere. There's something pathological about Coltrane's playing.  He sounds a bit like a dying cat.  He must have been heavy into the Heroin by this point.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This review is for the Two-Disc Special Edition released in 2001 by Warner Brothers.    Of course to many, this is considered to be the greatest movie ever made.  I personally think Casablanca, the first two Godfather epics, and Chinatown are better, and possibly several others, but still, Citizen Kane is undoubtedly one of the great masterpieces of Hollywood.  The movie generated a lot of controversy and mystique in its day with the alleged conflict it created with newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst.  The film was also a groundbreaking movie technically with the great depth of field shots and upward camera angles showing rarely seen ceilings.    The story line is about the life of the world's richest man.  First, we find a young Kane who falls backward into a fortune, one that he initially wishes to have no part of, but is cajoled by his parents and his financial trustee to grab this opportunity of a lifetime.  When Kane is finally old enough to have full control of his vast wealth, he elects to become involved in the newspaper business.  His reasoning is that he believes he has a moral obligation to report the truth and protect and help the people who can not help themselves.  Kane even goes as far as publishing a \\"Declaration of Principals\\".  Of course from that point on, we view a man gradually corrupting himself until he's finally a completely broken man.  There are many moral lessons found in this movie which is another reason why it's such a great classic.    There are countless memorable scenes in this film and many great quotes.  The greatest line of course is the last dying word of Kane and that is the word, \\"Rosebud\\".  From that point on,  the movie revolves finding the meaning behind that mysterious word.  Some of the other great quotes include, \\"If I hadn't been very rich, I might have been a really great man.\\"  Another of one of my all time favorites is, \\"You're right Mr. Thatcher.  I did lose one million dollars last year.  I expect to lose one million dollars this year.  I expect to lose one million dollar next year.  You know Mr. Thatcher, at the rate of one million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place -- in 60 years.\\"    Since the movie is so convoluted with flashbacks, plus it contains strange camera angles, visually captivating scenes and brilliant dialogue, it's nearly impossible to appreciate with just one or even two viewings.  That is why I would strongly recommend buying the 2 DVD Special Edition package.  This is actually the third time I've seen this movie.  The first time was in the mid-80's on the big screen in an art theater.  The second time was on VHS cassette.  In both cases, as I recall, the video image and the sound were poor and it made it difficult to appreciate and follow the film.  However, Warner's DVD transfer is perfect and the black and white tones are superb.  You will see some film damage in the newsreel portion of the movie, but that was intentionally done when the film was released to convey the illusion of an old, archived film.  The bonus features are also wonderful.  This is probably the third or fourth release of this movie on DVD and this edition is well worth the extra $10 or so for the superior image and sound quality, plus the extra CD bonus material which goes into great depth about Hearst and Welles and examines the great conflict between the two.  Anyone who appreciates truly great movies should have this particular DVD edition in their collection.      Movie: A+     DVD Quality: A+
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a superb adaptation of one of my favorite novels of all time.  The acting is fantastic, the scenery is gorgeous, the costumes are wonderful.  Each character is brought out supremely well by the perfectly-chosen actors who portray them.  Colin Firth...what can I say?  If I believed in reincarnation I would say that he is the very man Austen knew and portrayed in her novel.  Jennifer Ehle is excellent as Lizzie, and is as beautiful as the novel says she is supposed to be.  I don't know the actor who plays Mr. Collins' name, but he does it exceptionally well.  Well done are also the witty Mr. Bennet, the annoying Mrs. Bennett, the calm and sensible Jane, the inane younger sisterc, as, the affable aunt and uncle and the snake Mr. Wickham. Six hours may seem like a long time for a movie, but it goes by very fast, and your eyes are riveted to the screen every moment.  ( i only wish I had a 65\\" screen every time Colin Firth is on! too bad he's married...)  :) Absolutely fantastic and a wonderful addition to any DVD collection.

B0000027RL|1.0|What kind of \\"music\\" is this? Would I really call it \\"music\\"? It's more like a combination of terrible singing (or in this case \\"yelling\\"), atrocious guitar playing, tone-deaf bass playing, and clumsy drumming. You could take a bunch of fifth-graders from the local elementary school and they could put out a record much more fine and dandy than this piece of repulsive, untalented garbage. <br /> <br />First of all, what kind of person would listen to such an appalling record? One who hasn't embraced Mormonism into his or her life. This kind of album only encourages the ways of the devil into the minds of the young ones, and spawns feelings of anti-Christ actions and Liberal activities.  <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor: Put down the CD and torch it so that it will never be heard of again, and then go to your local Mormon Ward and accept the true religion into your life. This band known as \\"Pearl Jam\\" will be then forever known as a Satan-worshipping ensemble of mayhem. <br /> <br />Accept Mormonism. It's the right thing to do.
0451204530|3.0|This is yet another spy thriller by Follet. It is centered this time on the 1950s space race. It is very fast to read and the plot moves along with enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested till the end. If you have read Follet before you will find his usual trademark elements of action, suspense and romance. <br /> <br />Not his best, but great for a quiet afternoon at home or a long plane ride.   <br />
1400032717|5.0|A story told in the voice of a mentally ill child. It begins with him setting out to solve the mystery of who killed a neighbor's dog, although that is relatively soon solved and we are drawn into the absorbing tale of his relations with his parents.  In many ways it is funny, but I don't think Mark Haddon can be accused of ridiculing the mentally ill. The humor is often in the illogical reactions of those around Christopher.  Christopher is strictly logical, and is some kind of mathematical genius. The text is interpolated with problems in mathematics and logic that Christopher likes to solve.  I'm still puzzling over some of them.  Christopher often sounds morally and intellectually superior in some way to those around him, although their fury at him sounds utterly plausible and is expressed in wonderfully realistic demotic dialog. One of the reasons the dialog sounds so realistic is that it is transcribed by Christopher into perfectly grammatical and correctly spelled English. He nails every character perfectly.  The literary merit and entertainment value is beyond question. A question that does arise is whether this is an authentic insight into the thought processes of an emotionally disturbed child. Christopher is presumably meant to be the kind of  child who used to get labelled as mentally retarded  but shows areas of high intellectual ability. Terms such as \\"idiot savant\\" used to be used and then Kanner introduced \\"autism.\\" It is sometimes suggested that this is the childhood version of schizophrenia. \\"Asperger's syndrome\\" syndrome is often used (although what Asperger described was somewhat different).     I couldn't answer the question as regards Christopher but the tormented efforts of the adults in Christopher's to deal with the situations he creates certainly have the ring of authenticity.
0440178002|5.0|This is a long novel. You will have to invest a lot of your time to read it, and sometimes it's not an easy read. If you are a Westerner you will be immersed in a different world where everything you are used to and consider normal it's challenged. It takes a while to get into the book, it's slow at the beginning, but after 300 pages you will continue coming back for more. As I said, it takes effort to go thru it but at the end you will be sorry it is over and the story and characters will be with you for a long time. <br /> <br />If you have the patience this has the potential of being one of the most satisfying reading experiences of your life. <br /> <br />
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Simply put, if you are into guitar-driven rock and roll, this disc is a must-have.    And yet, Women And Children First isn't exactly my favorite VH album. I think it was the last DLR-VH album I bought back in the days of vinyl, but I was not disappointed when I did complete the DLR series. In fact, \\"In A Simple Rhyme\\" remains one of the best and one of my all-time favorite VH tunes. It rocks your, well, \\"rocks\\" off, yet fills your ears with grace and beauty, especially the Pink Floyd-esque mid-section.    There really isn't a bad song to be found on this record. In a word, it's much \\"grittier\\" than VH I or VH II. Even the acoustical and whimsical \\"Could This Be Magic\\" is a great little tune; full of fun, hedonism and \\"Halenism\\". I always want to call this track by the album's title, since chorus contains the lyrics \\"better save the women and children first.\\"    I had heard that the short instrumental at the end of Simple Rhyme was titled \\"Tank.\\" Someone claims it's called \\"Growth.\\" Verdict, anyone?    I do have one beef about this record. When I bought the vinyl, the song listing on the back cover wasn't quite right; it listed Tora Tora first, then I believe all the other songs in their correct order. Tora Tora actually opened side two of the original album. Well, what happened was I didn't pay attention to the label on the record (except to find Tora Tora) and started listening to side 2 as if it was side one. I recorded the album onto a cassette tape, with side 2 first and then side one. It wasn't until a few years later that I discovered my mistake. But you know what, I think the album works MUCH better with the two sides reversed! Think about it... wouldn't Tora Tora and Loss of Control make a much better opening to the album? And wouldn't the pounding final minute of \\"Romeo Delight\\" make an absolute killer ending? That's why I've burned an extra copy of my WACF with the songs in what I feel are the CORRECT order.    Call me a dork, but to me that's what music is and should be: a unique and personal experience. I'm glad I screwed up the track order! Try it out and see if you like it this way; you may just rediscover this magnificent classic in a new way.
0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins wrote the book Built to Last a few years ago, which describes what it takes to withstand great business status long term.  After writing this book, he was challenged to answer the question \\"How do you take a good company and make them a great company?\\"  Jim took this challenge and conducted a five-year study with a group of researchers to determine how great companies became great.  After years of looking at thousands of companies, Jim narrowed his reasearch to 11 companies who produced exponential results above the market average for a 15 year period.  Jim found that all of these companies had similar leadership and strategic traits.  The companies all had low-egoed level 5 leaders who developed a single hedgehog business concept.  They slowly developed a corporate culture of discipline and made sure they had the right employees in the right positions.  This book is a great read for anyone in a good company that wants to know what it takes to make the leap to a great company.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon, creator of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel,' is a genius.  This short-lived show (most wrongfully cancelled by FOX) was very unique.  I didn't watch the show when it first came on (didn't know much of it, probably due to the not-so-great promotion efforts), but rented the set first (hearing of it after getting sucked into the Buffyverse, so went to this to see what else Whedon's mind comes up with), and fell in love with it and eventually purchsed the set.  The characters are extremely interesting.  The idea of a Sci-Fi/Western mix itself is fascinating, plus seems more interesting than typical futuristic tales where everything is high-tech and shiny.  I love this more down-to-earth feel, with the ship (the main star), Serenity, being an older class model ship (a firefly), with wires and the likes in view.<br /><br />This show is really the first time in which I actually study the cinematography.  I watched the shows first, then went for watching with commentaries (which can actually be very funny and informative than other commentaries I've listened to on other DVDs), where I learn the way they designed Serenity and the lighting, purposely looking for glares and using handhelds, adding a shaky quality (adding to the feel that this crew are taking jobs they can get to survive; in a way, there lives are shaky, always in danger, running from the Alliance (Feds).<br /><br />Mal, Zoe, Wash, Jayne, Kaylee, Inara, Book, Simon, and River are intriging.  Though it may seem like it would be hard to remember 9 characters, it really isn't.  TV Shows were made to tell stories and characters's pasts over at least 20 eps a season, in hopes of continuing a story with more seasons.  'Firefly' didn't get that, but the foundation of these characters are presented, and hopefully the movie (and comic being released as well) can help extend what is learned during the short time on the show.  Maybe then, more movies can be made to continue the tale of these 9, actually 10 (Serenity), characters.<br /><br />The show itself, a Sci-Fi/Western, has everything that everybody likes.  Like Sci-Fi, it's there; like Westerns, it's there; like comedy, got that too; like action/adventure, you betcha; even some romance and drama.  All these qualities, beautifully put together.  It's just a shame it was cancelled.  Thankfully, Universal is a nice, lovely company that has an eye for quality.  They bought the rights, and now there's gonna be a movie, titled 'Serenity.'

B000002LGW|1.0|Back in the 80's I was quite the collector of DM 12\\" singles and eps, particularly UK imports. I've seen them live and enjoyed it very much. HOWEVER - having given this another listen I am disappointed to realize this is a very poor album. The songs themselves stick too close to the studio recordings. I remember the band utilizing custom crafted percussion instruments to great effect, but really, most of the music is merely pre-recorded tapes. I felt pity for Dave Gahan as he goaded the audience to respond with his near constant yelps and barks. I hated it. Unfortunately, a canned effort is what you're going to get each and every hellish night you have to sing these songs OVER and OVER and OVER again, NIGHT after NIGHT after NIGHT. I feel sorry for them during this stage of their career. Having to perform these every night for years should drive a sane person MAD.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I am not a very big fan of modern-day bands. Most of the music out today is not creative and sounds the same. I must say that I do like My Chemical Romance. I never heard of them until I saw the \\"Helena\\" video on MTV. I have bought and listened to both of the albums and even though their follow-up is more radio friendly, they have not sold out. There are so many music fans out today they hate any bands who go from cult to mainstream. The sounds of a band will change overtime. If you look at some of the greatest bands of all time (Rolling Stones, the Who, Cream, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin), they were all played on the radio and they all were well known all over the world and THEIR MUSIC CHANGED OVER TIME. Just because a band is well-known or has a video on MTV does not make them sell-outs. Stop trying to \\"be different\\" by only liking underground bands or bands not on a big lable. Like music in whatever form it comes in whether it is rock, emo, hip-hop, country or whatever else. If you want to be different, like music that you like and not just some genre that you think makes you different.
B000001FS3|5.0|Just for fun, listen to \\"Trip Through Your Wire\\" before anything else on this CD.  Why? Because it's the WORST song on Joshua Tree. Most groups would be happy to have it as their best. Whether you like the more radio-friendly tunes that open it, or the somewhat experimental diversions like \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" or \\"Exit,\\" there's something here for everybody. The Joshua Tree represents Bono and Company's songwriting zenith, but that's not all. They play magnificently well as a band, and here you see the great leap forward they took over their first couple of albums.  \\"War\\" has songs that rival those here, but they are crudely produced and performed in slapdash fashion. Yes, sometimes a live performance in the studio gives the best result, but sometimes you're better off fashioning your output.  They had a lot of help with the crafting, from Brian Eno, Steve Lillywhite and Daniel Lanois, and it shows.  Each song has a dynamic, a sense of build to a climax and then a resolution. And the album as a whole has its own dynamic.  It feels like the journey of a lost soul through the desert, stumbling onto mirage after mirage, never really finding the promised land but holding up hope till the end. Or am I just reading too much into that cover? <br /> <br />U2 never equalled this album, not before or since.  Never came close.  But then, not many have.
B000021XS0|5.0|After SCENES FROM A MEMORY, Dream Theater would begin their steady decline into watered-down prog metal.  However, we should not forget the great band they once were.  After the Liquid Tension Experiment records, it was clear to Portnoy and Petrucci that Jordan Ruddess belonged in Dream Theater.  They immediately got rid of Derek 'I'm a nobody' Sherinian and together with Ruddess put out the greatest concept album since Queensryche's OPERATION: MINDCRIME. <br /> <br />The lyrical concept is a bit corny, and gimmicky band t-shirts that had 'Victoria' written all over them were just a little too much.  The story line, according to some sources, is based on the movie, 'Dead Again' which I have not yet seen.  The basic story line is there's a guy in the present day who has been having nightmares, so he goes to a hypnotist.  After being hypnotized, this man learns about a love triangle from 1928 that involved two men and a girl.  It ends in a murder suicide.  At the end of the album, it turns out that the girl who was murdered is now reincarnated into the man being hypnotized, and the other guy who killed him is the hypnotist - who kills him again in the present day.  Therefore, he got killed by the same guy twice.  Get it?   <br /> <br />Apart from the story line, the music on this album is incredible.  It is written out like a play and different lyrics represent different characters, and those changes are written out in the liner notes.  The music represents everything we've heard from the preceeding Dream Theater albums, excluding the sub-par FALLING INTO INFINITY.  It is obvious the songs were well-written and planned out, and we hear dozens of influences such as Frank Zappa on the instrumental break in 'Fatal Tragedy,' Rush in...well we hear Rush all over the place!  We hear hauntingly beautiful piano pieces like 'Through Her Eyes,' and a concert favorite, 'The Spirit Carries On.'  We can hear their heavy metal influence in half the tracks, and they incorporate theprogressive elements without going overboard on the riffs.  There is some repetition, but not as much as recent Dream Theater.  Like previous records, we also get two indulgent instrumentals in 'Overture 1928' and 'The Dance of Eternity' which has some sampling from the intro for 'Metropolis Part 1, The Miracle and The Sleeper' in the beginning of the piece.  This album never left my car stereo for a period of around *2* years!   <br /> <br />The only complaint I have musically speaking is the intro to the song 'Home' and some rhythm guitar work in that same song.  It is obvious the band was trying to sound like Tool.  I can't stand that band, and while Portnoy was admitting at the time he was listening to Tool, it has no place on a Dream Theater record.  We would see more of this 'Tool influence' in later Dream Theater albums.  I repsect their intentions to evolve, but blatantly ripping off riffs from another band is not the way to go about it. <br /> <br />If you had a chance to see Dream Theater live on the tour for SCENES FROM A MEMORY, you are lucky.  It was truly a sight to see.  I personally saw *11* concerts on the tour including the last one at the Roseland Ballroom in NYC where the accompanying dvd was shot.  I AM ON THE DVD.  READ MY REVIEW OF THE DVD FOR DIRECTIONS ON HOW TO FIND ME!!!   <br /> <br />Even though this may be Dream Theater's most complete album, I would recommend buying something like IMAGES AND WORDS first.  It will assist you in appreciating this masterpiece on a much grander level. <br />
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt's memories of his early childhood in NY and then eventually moving and growing up in Limerick, Ireland was something I truly enjoyed reading. The movie which I saw after reading this book did not have the heart the book had. Although McCourt grew up very poor, with an alcholic father who eventually abandoned the family, and a mother who tried her best, it was written and told very honestly and to the point without an ounce of self-pity, with such heart, nostalgia and care that even the nastiest of characters didn't seem all that nasty. I don't really know how to explain it but it was clear to me that though McCourt certainly had a miserable childhood you know he would never ever trade those experiences and those times with his family for a much better one if he was given the chance.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Yes, that's correct.  Apart from being the last concert of the entire performace of the SCENES FROM A MEMORY album non-stop, this dvd automatically gets 5 Stars because the person reviewing it is on it! <br /> <br />Here's how to find me -  In the bonus features, find the section that says 'The Fans' - there is a short interview in the beginning with producer Kevin Shirley, and then there's a shot in the concert during 'Metropolis Part 1' followed by a shot outside the concert of all the people waiting in line.  There's a big space in the line, and as it pans by, you can hear LaBrie say something like 'Oh...here we go..\\" and I'm the guy with long dark curly hair who had his sunglasses propped up on his forehead and I stuck my face right in front of the camera for 2 seconds.  ROCK N' ROLL IMMORTALITY!!! <br /> <br />By the time this concert came around, I had already seen 10 previous shows on the tour.  That's right, TEN!  My only intention here was to somehow get on the dvd, and I did!  For those who missed out on the tour, I suppose it's interesting to see the integration of video clips that went along with the storyline of the album.  However, I believe the best part are the bonus tracks, such as A CHANGE OF SEASONS and LEARNING TO LIVE.  Buy this DVD for a phenomenal Dream Theater experience.  Buy the DVD because I'm on it!  Just buy it!
B000056H7W|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already?Opeth f*cking rule and are a band that any fan \\"real music\\" should get into.
B00005ASHM|5.0|\\"No one is educated musically until they've heard Pet Sounds...it is a total, classic record that is unbeatable in many ways.\\"  -  Sir Paul McCartney <br /> <br />and here's another quote... <br /> <br />\\"Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper wouldn't have happenned...Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds.\\"  -  Sir George Martin, Producer, The Beatles <br /> <br />There you have it folks.  Given these references, there is no reason people should doubt the importance and greatness of this work of art.  I know what you're thinking...you hear the name 'Beach Boys' and you think of songs like 'Little Deuce Coup,' 'Surfin' USA,' and 'Kokomo,' right?  Well those songs are corny, and they represent the nostalgia act that the Beach Boys have turned into over the last 30 years or so.  'Pet Sounds' is Brian Wilson's labor of love.  It represented the direction he wanted to take the band in, which eventually caused confusion and dissagreement within the group. <br /> <br />No matter what kind of music you listen to, whether it be Rock, Rap, Metal, Country, or Classical, it is vital that you own PET SOUNDS.  Brian Wilson's writing skills as well as the vocal harmonies throughout cannot be matched.  The two most popular songs are probably 'Wouldn't it Be Nice' and 'God Only Knows.'  Both of these songs have been used in countless movies including 'Roger and Me' and 'Boogie Nights.'  These songs represent all that is right with the world, and no matter what kind of mood you are in...no matter what is going on in your life, I promise you this album will cheer you up.  I am forever in debt to my good friend Michael Stack who once told me this record would change my life.  It did.   <br /> <br />On a side note, make sure you pick up the version of this record with 27 tracks, which has the entire album in mono and in stereo.  Included in this is the bonus track, 'Hang on To Your Ego' which is just the track 'I Know There's an Answer' with some lyrical changes.  Apparently, people say that when you eat LSD, you lose your ego.  Pay attention to the words...\\"they trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night\\"  This probably gave migraines to record executives at the time, and the band was forced to re-write the track for radio play!  The Beach Boys were supposed to be a wholesome group - not a bunch of guys doing drugs and hanging out with the likes of Charles Manson!

I started it at 5:30pm and finished at 3:30am ...

B00013M6NK|5.0|If you go to remote places, you need to have at least one extra battery for your camera.  At this price (used), I'd even buy three.  Even though this is rechargable and lasts longer than AA Batteries, you will lose a lot of battery charge when transferring images to another source (computer) or viewing them on the LCD.  You might figure 125-150 picutres on one battery, but the video will use even more.
0156027321|5.0|After his ship is lost at sea, a teenage boy drifts helplessly in a lifeboat, accompanied by several zoo animals, including a ferocious 450-pound tiger. This harrowing and imaginative tale recounts the physical and psychological lengths to which Pi is driven in order to survive. <br /> <br />Author Yann Martel is a masterful storyteller; I wish I had a tenth of his imagination. Early in the book, we meet Pi, the delightful, quirky, and nonconformist son of a zookeeper in India. Pi becomes obsessed with religion at a tender age, and embraces several different religions. He sees no contradiction in his claim that he is a Hindu, a Muslim, and a Christian -- simultaneously. At the same time, he learns a lot about wild animals. His zookeeper father's shockingly harsh lesson to his children in just how dangerous wildlife can be will stick with you forever. Just as important, it sets up the reader for a full realization of just how precarious Pi's position is, later, in the lifeboat. <br /> <br />I admit that I was skeptical at times, as I read this book. I felt that key bits of information were being withheld, and that some of the plot twists seemed too wildly improbable, even in the context of this improbable story. I was prepared to be really ticked off at author Yann Martel, convinced that he was setting me up for some major manipulation. I couldn't have been more wrong. Instead of the cheap plot twist I'd been girding myself for, Martel whisked me in a whole different direction toward the end, one that was completely unexpected but that I quickly realized the entire book had been hurtling toward, inevitably. <br /> <br />Throughout Life of Pi, readers will be astonished at the richness and lyricism of Martel's language and the originality of the storyline. It's a book that you will think about long after you've turned the last page. <br />

He is also performing abortions, which at this point in the United States, is illegal.  Dr. Larch performs these abortions, because as he says \\"If I don't do them properly or turn these women away, somone else will perform the abortion improperly\\" and we are shown the horrible results of a situation where that happens.   <br /> <br />Homer is very appreciative of everything that Dr. Larch has taught him, but feels that he must decide for himself what path his life will take.  He also has a serious issue with the idea of abortion.  So, Homer decides to leave with a young couple Candy(Charlize Therion) and Wally(Paul Rudd), whom just went through an abortion of their own.  Wally is a pilot for the air force, on a leave to help his mother with the harvesting of their apple orchards.  Homer decides that he would like to try his hand at apple-picking and gets a job at the orchards.   <br /> <br />While here, Homer stays with the rest of the apple-pickers; a group of southern, black men, very different from anyone that Homer has ever known in his sheltered life.  He takes to all of the men and finds that he really enjoys apple-picking.  Homer also falls deeply in love with Candy, while Wally is sent back to war.   <br /> <br />The boss of the apple-picking crew, Mr. Rose is a tough, mean boss, who prefers for his workers to \\"mind their business\\" and remember that their business is \\"the apple business, nothing else.\\"  Well, the movie really gets interesting when we find out that Rose, Mr. Rose's daughter, is hiding a pregnancy.  Homer discovers this immediatly, seeing as to how he is a trained physician.  He tries to talk Rose into taking a trip to St. CLoud to have a proper abortion, but his pleas fall on deaf ears.  <br /> <br />Then we discover that the father of Rose's baby is none other than her father, Mr. Rose.  At this point, Homer must make and face a critical decision.  He knows that if he does not perform the abortion, Rose will attempt to handle it on her own.  He also knows that their is no way that Mr. Rose will be willing to let Rose leave to go to St. Cloud.  So, Homer goes against his earlier morals and decides to perform the abortion on his own.  After he does so, Dr. Larch overdoses on ether, a drug he has somewhat of an addiction to and Homer realizes that the real world is really no different than the illegal one he knew at St. Cloud, only at St. CLoud, he was actually making the world better for many people, whereas in the real world, nobody else cared enough to let him help, when he felt he was capable of helping. <br /> <br />This is an extremly fascinating movie, complete with a great cast, great writing, a great score and wonderful setting. This movie tackles controversial issues such as abortion and incestial rape and shows very grapically the repercussions of both. <br /> <br />The title is intriguing, because when Homer reads the Cider House rules to his fellow apple-pickers(none of them can read), they all laugh, because they either break those rules all of the time or have no intention of ever doing what is forbidden in the others; except of course, sitting on the roof.  Prior to Home reading that rule about no sitting on the roof; none fo the apple-pickers had ever done so.  Well, after he read that rule to them, we see them on the roof numerous times.  As Mr. Rose states \\"Those ain't our rules.  They was written by folks that don't live here.  We live here.  We make our own rules.\\"  And that is basically the plot of this story.  Dr. LArch had been \\"making his own rules\\" everytime that he decided to perform an abortion or when he forged a Harvard diplomawith Homer's name on it.  He was doing things his way and, in the end, the best way for everyone.  Homer \\"made his own rules\\" when he decides to hep Rose and perform an abortion for her. <br /> <br />This movie is really excellent and thought-provoking and is really worth watching.  Very boring for children, so don't even bother showing to them.  No extreme violence or sex scenes and although numerous abortions are performed in this movie, nothing very graphic is shown---THANK GOD. <br /> <br />A definate movie to check out! <br />Great Job to the cast on this one!!
B0006IIPIK|5.0|When I think of this movie, I always think of that passage in THE PRINCESS BRIDE where the grandfather assures his skeptical grandson that while this is indeed a kissing book, it also includes, \\"Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters. Chases. Escapes. True love. Miracles.\\" <br /> <br />SKY CAPTAIN has all that, plus robots, submarines, Shangri-la, and some of the prettiest cinematography I've ever seen, thanks to some revolutionary new CG.  The silvery, ever-so-slightly blurred picture perfectly evokes early cinema, and the episodic nature of the movie puts this right up with the Indiana Jones trilogy. <br /> <br />The story is a little something like this: several important scientists go missing right around the time giant robots begin to appear in major cities, causing chaos and destruction.  Only the legendary mercenary Sky Captain Joe (Jude Law) can stop them.  Joe's old flame, Polly, is the city's ruthless top reporter, who sees in these strange events the story of a lifetime, and is bound and determined to tag along with joe wherever he goes: a radioactive mineshaft, an ocean trench, or even outer space. <br /> <br />The acting was, of course, wonderful...I have a desperate love for Giovanni Ribisi (who plays a youngish Q-figure), would drink Jude Law's dirty bathwater, and would follow Angelina Jolie through the gates of hell, so I loved them in this.  Gwyneth Paltrow played, as per the usual, a hopelessly annoying character, but I was okay with that, since her character is tormented pretty much the whole time.  From the old-married couple bickering between Joe and Polly to Frankie's (Jolie) scathing \\"What is *that*?\\" upon seeing Polly getting out of a plane less than gracefully, the dialogue is great.  There are a few rocky moments, but overall, nothing detracts from the sense of fun, adventure, and quirky romance present in this little gem of a movie.
6305841861|3.0|I have read so many reviews, claiming \\"Evil Dead 2\\" to be one of the best horror films ever written.  Many say that this movie, is hilarious and just their favorite to watch.  I don't see that. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, this film is enjoyable; but it certainly does not qualify as a horror classic. <br /> <br />This is basically a remake of the original \\"Evil Dead\\"(which I found to be a much better film). <br /> <br />Ash(Bruce Campbell) revisits the cabin in the woods that he was in during the first film.  While there, he stumbles upon the Book of the Dead and unleashes an evil spirit intent on killing every living thing in its path. <br /> <br />That's the only plot this film gives.  Dialogue is also very rare in this film. <br /> <br />Campbell battles with the evil spirits or zombies(they are dead) until they are finally cast back where they came from. <br /> <br />This movie is funny and should definetly not be taken seriously.  The gore is phenomenal and is what kept me interested in the film.  I understand the whole \\"Rambo\\" parody that writer/director Sam Raimi was going for, but I don't find it to be funny or effective at all. Rather, I find the undead and the way in which they attack Campbell to be funny.   <br /> <br />The DVD extras are worth viewing on this film and there is a commentary track included.  This movie is not suitable for young children or squemish folks; but if you are not part of either category, I would recommend checking this film out for a good laugh.   <br /> <br />All in all, I will watch this film again, and perhaps after further viewings; find the \\"classic\\" status so many label this film with.  But, until then, I find this to be an adequate horror film, lacking in pot, but full of laughs and gore. <br /> <br />HAVE FUN!
B000024D4R|5.0|This album contains 5 songs, so when I was first buying it I was very interested in why there was only 5 songs. I wasn't sure it was a very long album, but it turned out 3 of the songs are over 10 minutes long and then I realized how cool and epic this band really was. This is a darker album by Pink Floyd. It is an amazing album which includes one of my personal favorite songs of all time, Dogs. Dogs runs over 17 minutes long and blows me away every time I listen to it. If you're a true fan you will buy this album.<br /><br />Yes, Dark Side... and The Wall are great albums, but their are more Pink Floyd albums out there to love and have. Sheep is a really cool heavy rocker song on the album. It is also contained on their greatest hits package Echoes. I guess having the song Echoes on there, being 23 minutes there was just no room for Dogs(Which is better then most the songs on the greatest hits), but I'm happy they atleast included one song from this great not as well known album of theirs, Animals.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|This set of cds, from what i'm told, is Ryan Adams' tribute to Jerry Garcia.  The cover art and theme tend to lend credit to this theory.  Anyway, the point is that I think that this cd is tributed to Jerry, and not to the Grateful Dead, definitely not to the Grateful Dead's music, or even Jerry's music outside of the context of Jerry as a person.  I think that the lyrics and music pay a fitting tribute to the personality and life of Jerry, if you know anything about his problems and the beauty that he brought to all of us who appreciate his music.  Taken in this context, these cds are mind-blowing.  Absolutely incredible.  I don't know anything about Ryan Adams' music besides these discs, but considering the source of inspiration for this music, I doubt that it can be easily compared to his other works.  Like I said, this is not a tribute to the Grateful Dead or their music, there are no Grateful Dead songs, and the style is very different.  Worth checking out if you have the interest.
B0007ZEO4G|4.0|The Year was 1975 and Deep Purple shared the title of Greatest Hard Rock band with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath(still do in my opinion). David Coverdale was an unknown singer and 12 years away from being ridiculed as the big-haired David \\"Cover-version\\".<br /><br />Deep Purple has always remained one of my favorites for one reason and one reason only.....his name is IAN PAICE!! When Music historians look at the great rock drummers, Ian Paice is at the top of the heap alongside the obvious greats like John \\"Bonzo\\" Bonham.<br />For years I have contemplating buying this CD as an import or downloading in some form or another. Well, thanks to my brother, I can stop contemplating this. I received this on my birthday and overjoyed to have it in my collection.<br />This album opens with the fast paced full-throttle title song - BURN and it does. Incidentally, this song and \\"Speed King\\" (from In Rock) and Highway Star(from Machine Head) are the way a Deep Purple album should start off-just rocking and slamming.<br />As the album continues, you realize the injection of Coverdale and Glenn Hughes's influences into the compositions of this already great band of musicians. Ian Paice completely holds everything together with his complicated drumming patterns on \\"You Fool No One\\". Of course, Jon Lord plays that Hammond organ better than anyone ever has before or since. And Ritchie Blackmore shows that 30 years ago he was capable (for a short time) to collaborate with someone else besides his own ego.<br />Coverdale shows true soul and feeling in his vocals for the mid-tempo classic \\"Mistreated\\". Blackmore liked it so much he continued to play it in concert with Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio on vocals. Coverdale continued to play this song with his underrated post-Purple band..Whitesnake(perhaps you've heard of them). Glenn Hughes harmonizes fantastically well with his Co-lead singing with Coverdale and the two of them would occassionally work together years after they and Purple would part ways.<br />For those who continue to criticize Deep Purple and Coverdale for their work in the 80's and 90's need to look back at this masterpiece from 1975 and realize that they were great then and still demand respect because of their contribution to the history of Great Rock & Roll!!For those who continue to criticize Deep Purple and Coverdale for their work in the 80's and 90's need to look back at this masterpiece from 1975 and realize that they were great then and still demand respect because of their contribution to the history of Great Rock & Roll!!
B000A2RRF4|4.0|The Dangerous World Tour set is a wise compromise : MJ sings most of his mainstream hits, and the global experience is something between pure rock concert and hollywood musical. <br /> <br />Despite the odd outfits (remember this weird gold top ??), MJ dances and sings his heart out for more than 2 hours during this Goliath-ic gig. <br /> <br />Mj hardcore fans will tell you they prefer the Bad Tour concert, and they are right, since this previous tour was more about music. <br /> <br />The Dangerous Tour is THE MJ show to recommend to any non fan, new fan, or any other newbie. <br /> <br />Most of the tricks and ideas were core elements of the previous tours, but here they seem more polished and sophisticated. <br /> <br />The Dangerous Tour : Michael plays Jackson : the monster \\"toaster\\" + long \\"strike a pose\\" entrance is, so far, the best opening ever staged in a Jackson concert.  <br />MJ comes in from nowhere, and, at the end, leaves the audience speechless, when riding a solid and sophisticated nasa-style equipment that, don't get me wrong, definitely flies him to the moon. <br /> <br />Hardline, Magic, State of the Art : Michael Jackson live is all that, and even more... <br /> <br />Main low point : the gradual and disappointing lip-sync routines : Jam and Smooth Criminal are ok though (those kind of songs are so hard to sing AND dance live that MJ has some excuse), but why using this \\"technique\\" on ALL the Dangerous Songs (Black Or White, Heal The World, Will You Be There etc..)? <br />Most end of those songs are sung live anyway, but, knowing the man has one of the most amazing voice in the History of popular music, it's a shame the staging focuses more on what we see instead of what we hear. <br /> <br />Note : Of course, No Bonus included, like most Michael Jackson DVD releases...
B00004XPPB|4.0|Under organized crime, the weak suffered while the corrupt prospered - but in \\"Donnie Brasco\\" we see another group entirely: the middle-group of middling gangsters utterly demoralized by the crushing pressures of the other two.  Joe Pistone (Depp) infiltrates local mafia under the name Donnie Brasco.  His lead to organized crime is an aging and fading enforcer named Ben \\"Lefty\\" Ruggiero played by Pacino.  Ruggiero is an odd choice for Pistone, because the feeble killer is himself one step away from being \\"whacked\\" by his boss, Sonny Black (Madsen).  Black's crew is decidedly small-time, but ambitious, and Pistone/Brasco thinks it's the perfect vehicle with which to launch his infiltration of organized crime.  Thus, the story links Brasco's assimilation into the mafia with Black's ambitions to rise in the ranks of gangsters.  Entering Black's circle with help from Lefty, Pistone/Brasco allows he older gangster to become his mentor, even as Lefty is obviously on his way out.  In fact, Pistone so gamely hunts the Mafia that he becomes less concerned with his own safety than the successes of Black's crew.  \\"Brasco\\" the movie is actually a stand-out movie - complimenting \\"Goodfellas\\" in its depiction of middle-level criminals who hold themselves as lords of their own domain but are otherwise ants below the real bosses.  Pacino is great as a man who's sure he's facing the end, but is still willing to hold the umbrella for higher bosses.  But Madsen is also great as Black - also conscious of his low position, but clearly looking for meatier game.  Lastly, Depp proves there's still little that he can't handle, as the understated Brasco - his high-point scene: explaining \\"fughedaboudit\\" in all its many permutations to fellow agents.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|this cd is simply amazing. it is incredible how much this group have matured and i would have nevr expected such a beautiful melodic sound out of them. they still have every bit of heaviness as they have always had, which got a little out of hand on iowa if you ask me that cd mostly was trying way to hard to be to heavy and sounded like a lot of noise most of the time, but this time they add more singing and even acoustic guitars to break it up. track 6 circles is realy the first song that hits you with the change, duality i guess too but not as drastic, it comes from out of nowhere and it is great. this band have surpased the expectations of i think even their hardest critics. a lot of people that were only into slipknot for the nu-metal tag which didnt fit right if you ask me might be disapointed. no rapping and even the dj doesnt use his turntables in a rappy  nu metal fashion. people who thought slipknot had no talent will have to shut up after hearing the truly great musicianship on this record. it may be a few years but i cannot wait until slipknot comes back at us with their next record. this is slipknots masterpeice just as promised, well maybe until thre next record.
B00005JNEW|5.0|This is a great movie.  <br />- Love that it is filmed like a documnetary, but it's still a traditional movie. <br />-Excellent acting by all the players, especially Jay Hernandez. Tim Mcgraw does a great job as well. He is proving to be a great actor <br />-Billy Bob Thorton is a GENUIS in this role. This has got to be his best preformance to date, and is just phenomenal.  <br />This is a striking true, real account of a true story. Filmed with such insight and greatness. I loved loved loved this movie! The story with Don and his dad is great, and touching. Also, the personal story and struggles of coach Gaines is touching too.  <br />I have read some of the other reviews, and have to say- yes people- Football really is life in Texas. And you might think that high school football is nothing more than over grown kids suited up, but football players are bred here in TEXAS, and high school football is better than a lot of college ball.  <br />Think about it- especially in WEST Texas- there is not much else to do. It's a great story - about how football is life, but you must realize in the end - it's just a game.  <br />
B0009I7NNA|5.0|avenged svenfold have done exactly what they set out to do with this record, which was seprate themseleves from the hardcore scene as much as possible. sure waking the fallen was a great album and i love hardcore and metalcore so im nowhere near bashing those genres, but aveneged 7x was always one of those bands i could tell where thrown into that genre because they came out in a time when it was popular and they hated it. there new cd sounds like something that could have came out in the late 80's a great retro-metal album. some people complain about the vocals well consider the circumstances, and they even said they werent going to scream becuase everybody does so its not selling out, and yeah his singing isnt as clean but this is suppossed to be an in your face metal record with plenty of attitude and the grity vocals help that come through. i love the vocals the fit so well with what the band was trying to do and we all know shadow could sing like he did on waking the fallen if he wanted. the guitars on this cd are beyong belief, guitar solos all over the place and each one of them is amazing. this band shows off all their talent on this record and deliever a cd any classic metal fan should love. sure you have those who will say they were metalcore so always metalcore i dont care this sucks blah blah blah but you know they are close minded idiots and so are the metalcore fans who wont give this record a chance because theirs no screams well boo freakitty hoo why dont you cry about it. i hate how people have their certain little things a band must do or they sold out. oh you dont scream anymore you sell outs or you dont have as many breakdowns or anything else it is so stupid to sit there and whine and cry like little kids about stuff like that. i like the whole western feel they added to the beggining of track 7 or 8 i cant remember distinctly. in conclusion fans of classic metal stuff that came out in the 80's early 90's should really like this and it gives a new generation of kids a nice introduction to the genre.
0385608136|5.0|I'd heard wonderful things about this novel, including the sale of world rights and film rights, so was prepared for a good read, but even so it took me by surprise -- Q&A is a poignant, funny, rich, beautifully written novel with an utterly original and brilliant structure at its heart.   A rare joy.
B000001GBJ|5.0|If there was such a word as \\"melanthereal,\\" that would describe the music of Secret Garden's CDs.  It is at once melancholy and ethereal...and the joining of the two creates an exquisite mood rarely found in the contemporary music today.  I've purchased all of Secret Garden's CDs and, while each contain songs that move my heart every time I listen, Songs from a Secret Garden remains my favorite.<br /><br />Secret Garden's music is a poignant dance between violin and piano that has a way of enrapturing the senses and capturing the heart.  The music accomplishes what so much other music of today is incapable of:  it digs deep into the soul and has the ability to touch long forgotten memories and emotions...and, given the right setting, richly invents new ones.  I have often found my cheeks wet after listening to this music....and friends and family to whom I have recommended these CDs concur.  For that reason, some may feel the music dabbles too heavily in sentimentality....yet, as a hopeful romantic, that is exactly why I love these songs so much.<br /><br />Listen to this music at night, with your candles lit, a glass of wine in hand...and allow the music to sweep you away into a bittersweet interlude.
B00005JLH3|4.0|The \\"Rocky\\" plot was so good and successful that it has been recycled many times - such as in \\"The Karate Kid\\".  I don't know if I would have thought that the plot would adapt well to a story about elite college marching bands, but it does.<br /><br />Since that plot must follow certain lines there is little that is surprising, so the success of such a film depends on the performances and \\"little things\\".  Drumline gets \\"the little things\\" right.<br /><br />Nick Cannon plays our hero, a snare drummer so talented that he is recruited from his NYC High School on a scholarship to play at fictional Atlanta A&T.  (Of note: many REAL college marching bands are represented and, as Roger Ebert noted in his review, the famous Morehouse Marching Band figures prominently and was a good sport to allow their leader to serve as the \\"bad guy\\" in the story.) Devon Miles is proud and hard-headed, and doesn't tell the bandleader that he plays from memory because he can't read music - obviously a shortcoming in a band member.  But he is also a spectacular drummer, and in one of the brilliant early scenes he tracks his uninvolved father down to tell him that he is graduating from high school, going to college, is not on drugs and doesn't have any illegitimate kids running around.<br /><br />There is the expected \\"love interest\\".  There is the realistic mentoring, courtesy of Orlando Jones as Dr. Lee, the bandmaster.  There is the tense rivalry between hot upstart freshman Devon and Leonard Roberts as Sean Taylor, the Senior Section Leader of the Drumline.  And there are some spectacular scenes of incredible high-stepping choreography and musicianship as the various bands strut their stuff en route to the BET Championship.<br /><br />If you think a movie about marching bands would be boring, you might be surprised.
B0000CFW87|5.0|While watching Josh Groban's PBS special, I sat on the edge of my seat, totally enraptured by the magnificent tonal quality and clarity of his voice...and equally captured by the passion with which he sings.  Not since watching Bocelli and Pavarotti have I been so blown away by a man's operatic-style voice.  I rushed out and bought his first CD and truly wondered if he could repeat the splendor with subsequent CDs.  Having listened to \\"Closer,\\" I am not disappointed in the slightest.<br /><br />While it is difficult for me to decide whether I prefer Josh singing English or Italian, this CD, to a greater extent than his first, gives me the best of both.  My favorite song on this CD is \\"Remember When It Rained.\\"  A friend insisted I listen to it one day and, by the time it ended, I found tears welling up in my eyes.  What emotion Josh's music is able to invoke!  Another favorite is \\"Si Volvieras a Mi\\" (If You Returned to Me)...the lyrics alone would make this a favorite.<br /><br />If you have not already purchased Josh's first CD, \\"Josh Groban,\\" I highly recommend purchasing both.  If you are a romantic who revels in heartfelt lyrics, gorgeous melodies and a passionate voice that encompasses both, you will not be disappointed.
B00000AFDW|4.0|The reviews are all over the map on this one-so here's the deal. <br />A typical Kiss record has about 5 very strong songs, the remainder is medoicre material. Psycho Circus falls right into <br />line. (Destroyer is an exception-A KISS masterpiece) The record starts strong with Psycho Circus, a cool rocker from Paul. Gene comes thru with three moody mid-tempo pieces that work really well-Within, We are One and Journey of 1000 years.  Ace jams on Into the Void. Those are the 5 strong tracks, the other tunes are mediocre. A few more rockers from Paul which are decent and a ballad from Peter, which is pleasant, but not memorable. <br />Many of the songs are celebrating their survival and triumph in the world of rock and roll. They were in the midst of a celebratory tour, so it rubbed off on the lyrics.  They have every right to take this victory lap. Brilliant CD packaging with holographic image. Well worth the price of admission!
B00005QCYC|5.0|I say that Jurassic Park 2; The Lost World is the absolute best of the three because everything about it is perfect, Jurassic Park 1 is almost as good as the second, and Jurassic Park 3 is Ok. I love the Lost World because of extreme scenes like the San Diego rampage scene.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|I listened to this CD with an open mind and trying to ignore her obviously fake punk pose. But it wasn't like it had cute poppy songs like her first album, in fact, I found it monotonous, lacking of substance, and perhaps giving more importance to the photographs inside the booklet where Avril tries to come off like, yet again, a real (?) punk.  <br />Temptingly, it's called Under My Skin, like you really wanna go there (?) like it really takes you anywhere...? All the songs sounded the same to me, and it makes me think that she is no better than all the other crappy posers of today. This isn't rock, this isn't punk, it's some sort of strange dull teenybop.  <br />I didn't hate it, but I think it doesn't have any substance and it doesn't deserve the hype. A so-so album.
0783229372|5.0|I first saw the full screen version on The History Channel and when it was over I thought it was a very artistical and brilliant disaster dramatization movie. As far as I can say, everything about this picture is perfect all the way down to the color screen switch to black and white footage.  I have yet to see this DVD though. From what I hear from some other reviews the DVD has screen and sound problems but, that should not ruin the fun of the movie. If some of the other reviews make you unsure about buying this movie on DVD then rent it before you buy it because that is what I am going to do.
B00082IJ08|4.0|I personally thought this 'animated group' would fade away after their Debut a few years ago [with great songs like \\"Clint Eastwood\\" and \\"19/2000\\"].  But, the cartoonists must have had the urge for some more.  The concept of this band still baffles me, but, the music is good, which erases all of my doubts.  Former Blur Frontman Damon Albarn adds mystique to the songs with his unique voice, and when combined with the hip-hop sounds, its only gets better.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Dirty Harry\\" and \\"Last Living Souls\\" are quite amusing despite their repitition in lyrics.  I must warn you though, not all songs are like the popular track \\"Feel Good Inc.\\".  Most have more of a slow techno feel to them.  Definitely an original, experimental group, which creates some good music.  This CD won't get old for a while.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Who says that old movies are not good anymore. I love Steven Spielberg's JAWS which is based on the novel by Peter Benchley. I was originally gong to get the 25th Anniversary edition but, when I saw the 30th Anniversary edition I bought that instead because it looked very promising and a good place to start JAWS. (I am saying that I am a Jaws first timer) I am very satisfied with my purchase. I like movies that are based on good books. I also recommend that you see the sequel JAWS 2 next, because it is very good too. I have already seen the other two sequels on tv and they suck eggs, so avoid them at all costs.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is what the Chili Peppers are all about.  Killer riffs to kick off the album [\\"Around the World\\"], crazy funk music one song [\\"I Like Dirt\\"], amazing lyrics in another [\\"Californication\\"], as well as a little slower pace [\\"Road Trippin'] to close off the CD.  And for this variety, I would say it can't get much better.  A ton of thought obviously went into this album as it almost seems like a \\"traveling theme\\" emerges through almost every song.  Despite being out for years now, I still find myself going back and listening to it as I was a little dissapointed by the lack of experiments in \\"By the Way\\".<br /><br />  Did i mention \\"Scar Tissue\\" was on this CD!?  I've yet to find a song on this CD that isn't good.

B0001YRVN4|5.0|I like all the star wars films, but I know the first trilogy is about incest. by the end of star wars, it's clear that luke and princess leah like each other. by the end of empire, romance is clearly in the air. and by the end of jedi, we learn the truth: star wars is about incest. princess leah knew all along she was lukes sister, but hid that from him. why? on the bridge at endor at the close of jedi, leah almost tells him, but changes her mind and kisses him instead. I never thought too much about incest before, but this story really made me think.

B00080ZG10|5.0|I really like this film as it really has its act together. The story of Howard Hughs was a story that was just waiting to happen. This film shows the man who really wanted to leave his mark on the sands of time. This film shows his various efforts in Film making, the start of the Aerospace industry and his descent into madness. (Which did not stop him from becoming one of the richest men in America.) Well done to all hands involved!

There is a god, and he exists in radiohead. Ill only review one song,Let Down. <br />'Let Down' is honestly, THEE most BEAUTIFUL, DRAMATIC, BRILLIANT peice of music I have EVER heard. This song is about losing faith in god, through most of the song, its 'sad' and kind of depressing, but this is only necessary to spin the listener into a thought-provoking end. In the last 1.30secs of the song, it tells how one can find god, and in this case has, and that all this time the pain and misery of life has done a 180, because once one has found god all comes into perspective. <br /> <br />I cant really explain this song in human words. Ill have more luck leavining this review blank. <br /> <br />Ive never grown tired of this song, u know how a song jsut wears out? this song doesnt for me...its made me cry so many times its insane, i listen to it every single day. <br /> <br />'Let Down' is the most beautiful aspect of life. The most beautiful thing in the universe. <br /> <br />Dont buy this album if u wanna experience an equalibrium between u and god. Just Dont.
B00005O3VC|5.0|It does not get any better than this! If you want to see MPFC Masterpiece, then here you go! I just love to watch this when my Born Again relatives come lurking around. If you are a Christian having a sense of humor and a semi open mind you should enjoy it.  <br />I feel that this film will be watched, banned, burned, condemned and laughed at a 100 years from now. So relax and be happy! And look on the bright side of life!
B00005JMAH|3.0|haryy potter 3 the book is the best in the harry potter series. but the film is cut short and lots of the interesting parts are missing. but the film is ok by their acting and all the special effects. its worth the price you know.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|I just wish my University days had been as much fun. But some of the Houses were trying very hard to keep up the tradition.  <br />So if you want a blast to the past to recapture the magic moments of some great actors and actresses then this is one of them. John where ever you are now, Thanks for the laughs!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this CD, Coldplay has done it again...it's amazing.  The lyrics, the composition, the emotion of this CD is simply fabulous...I have recommended this to all of my family and friends. <br /> <br />
B00005PJ8O|5.0|This is one of the 1st great war movies that I had seen when I was a youngster. G.C. Scott was just wonderful as \\"Him\\".<br /><br />While it was not a perfect flick (Patton had a much higher voice, Bradley was not so a great General, wrong tanks)The overall theme and spirit captures one of our greatest Generals.<br /><br />I still feel sorry for the poor Italians and Germans who went up against this man. They never had a chance!! I just hope that Valhalla is big enough for such a man.
6305718903|4.0|<br />{Brief spoilers}: <br /> <br />A rosary in Brazil is stolen from a corpse after a bizzare funeral takes place and is sold. That's where the whole plot starts. Next, Patricia Arquette's character begins experiencing cataclymic changes in her life that makes everyone think she is losing her mind. For example, she causes one huge destruction on a subway train while being beaten on her back repeatedly by an unseen force. She also gets bloody holes in her palms. The same thing happens 2 times and she is sent to the hospital 2 times, and a  bunch of other really strange stuff happens that she can't explain. My guess is because she said she isn't religious in this movie. Her character then writes  either latin or aramiac on the wall and, in another scene, shouts that language in a male voice. Every answer leads to another question and her only hope is an exorcism. It seems like another kind of \\"Exorcist\\" movie to me. If it sounds good to you, I recommend it. \\"Stigmata\\" also has great special effects for the genre. It's sort of a religious/ritualistic/pay-attention-to-the- plot/crime/thriller type of film, and yeah, it is pretty neat. 4 stars=Really good. It was so creepy, it almost even scared me like \\"The Ring\\" and I'm hard to scare!  <br /> <br />So... you see my point now.
0393035158|1.0|What a sore disappointment! The title is appealing. I thought I was going to be reading a thoughtful analysis of terrorism. Instead, this is a work of overweening reductionist arrogance.    Here I am, a rationalist with undergraduate work in science and graduate degrees in philosophy and Medieval studies. My inclination is to be skeptical of all claims, religious or secular, beyond the observable and measurable. Blind faith seems unwise, and I'm just as skeptical of dogmatic atheism as of dogmatic religion. I'm also a political activist suspicious of fundamentalism and all other brands of dualist thinking. While I've read extensively in Eastern mysticism and years ago practiced Kundalini Yoga, I drifted away from it and prefer the Western Neoplatonist tradition, which to Americans is embodied in the poetry of Walt Whitman, and Process Philosophy. Now you know my biases.    The title of the book is highly misleading. Harris's reasoning does not follow the methodologies of Western logic from the time of Ockham to our day, but uses finger-pointing and character assassination, and sometimes verges on hysteria. Strangely, this muddy work has received plaudits from many that should know better, including the president of Union Theological Seminary. However, an enthusiastic review by Alan Dershowitz (who, like Harris, has condoned the use of torture) should be enough to put off genuinely skeptical readers.     Harris remains curiously blind to his own tautologies, and especially to his extreme dualism. He is a dualist agnostic or perhaps dualist atheist, seeing the world in the form of either-or choices. I have many friends who are agnostics and atheists, have belonged to various skeptical organizations, and didn't disagree with everything Harris wrote (I'm scared of G.W. Bush and his religious nut crowd, too), but Harris is like some other agnostic writers I've read who consider themselves to be rational. He uses an exceptionally narrow definition of \\"rationality.\\" Evidently he does not understand that we usually perceive reality as a COMBINATION of a priori \\"pure\\" reason, a posteriori experiment and observation (empiricism), and a dose of inspiration--which religious people call revelation.     I especially objected to his sneering. He enjoys putting down great figures of the past, who could hardly be expected to agree with everything that a 21st century grad student believes. Few would claim that pacifism is the ideal solution to all oppression, and I seriously doubt that Gandhi would have achieved anything in Hitler's Germany but his own martyrdom, but when Harris tosses nonviolence into the same \\"dogmatic\\" camp as terrorism, my reaction was to mutter \\"Ridiculous!\\"    Nor does he seem to understand that the subjective, fallible, highly imperfect, ill-informed and irrational human mind is a major cause of terrorism--that we are NOT rational animals, but rationalizing ones. This is where I part company with many agnostics who still consider humans perfectible. Unfortunately, most can and will perform the grossest of evils as long as an excuse for it can be provided. A \\"holy\\" excuse isn't required, just any kind of rationalization--plus ignorance. Recall those experiments in social psychology in which subjects kept on \\"torturing\\" others (whom they believed to be fellow-subjects) with electric shocks because Science in the person of a senior experimental scientist legitimized the experiment?    Finally--the author is not well informed about genuine liberal religion. Although he continually sneers at it he does not discuss it except in superficial generalizations. He excludes liberal religion as hopelessly benighted, in part because it is \\"irrational.\\" He claims it relies on blind faith--not HIS brand of blind faith, of course! The index--and so far as I could see the entire book, although I must confess that after a while I began skimming it--contains not one reference to Unitarianiam, Universalism, Process Philosophy, or any of theleading figures of liberal religions that make every possible effort to avoid both blind faith and dogmatic reductionism. Not that \\"faith\\" is to be despised as Harris does. I am not a follower of Francis of Assisi, yet I admire him and his life and example have had, over the centuries, positive effects on ethics. Harris's snide dismissal of him was crude and insulting--as if Francis could have prevented certain unsavory activities of his order after his death! He entirely overlooks their positive achievements, like their egalitarian preaching that helped to inspire social rebellions all over Europe--like the 1381 Peasants' Revolt in England that tripled the net earning power of the lower classes from the end of the 14th century through most of the 15th.     As for mysticism, I'll stick with the pragmatic, humane, Western Neoplatonist tradtion. The mysticism of the East, while providing insights, relies too much on the concept of maya and on pantheist and panpsychist concepts of deity, which erode ethics and make practical changes in society, including relief of suffering, seem futile. No thanks. Give me my Medieval friend Juliane of Norwich, with her sense of humor, loving tolerance, and disbelief in hell.    This book can be summed up in one word: \\"crank.\\" I'll file this one in my library with Velikovsky, the BOOKS OF CHARLES FORT and Ignatius Donnelly's ATLANTIS.    It's not worth your time. Instead, read or reread the old classic, Eric Hoffer's THE TRUE BELIEVER, and a fine recent book that--refraining from insults and hysteria--better understands the terrorist connection to religion (and fanaticism), Charles Kimball's WHEN RELIGION BECOMES EVIL.
0375759174|5.0|This is a very well done book! I congradulate Jane Austen on yet another classic. Many reviewers stated that this was less mature then Austen's other novels, well duh! She was like 17 at the time! This is better then what some of the top authors today can write! I really liked this novel because it's easier for me to relate to because i'm 14. Catherine is really likable and I totally didn't predict the ending! This book was hard for me to find funny though, maybe i didn't get the humour? I liked Henry Tilney and hope they make a big movie of this novel with good actors/actresses. I HIGHLY reccomend this book to Jane Austen fans!!!!!!!
0156027321|5.0|I was truly impressed by this book and after it was over, it left me yearning for more of the same-whether it's another book by this author or more details about the story.  I really enjoyed reading this book, thinking about this book, and talking about this book.  It was amazing to me that after I had finished, it kept sinking in slowly.  This is more than just reading, it's entertainment!
B00068ULLY|5.0|I enjoyed Kill Bill vol. 1. It had a great plot. Also, it's a good movie to see in many different situations - with your significant other, your crew, and even your family (older family members). If you haven't seen it yet, you need to see it. It's great. Bang Band she shot me down will be in your head for FOREVER!!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|Most reviews make me very angry for a variety of reasons, so I appologize to those like me out there.  Having said that, I will continue to review this album because it is my co-favourite ever (with Amnesiac).  Fewer guitars than OK Computer, more atmospheric, comparisons are odious.  The soundscapes created in each song are beautiful and rich.  The lyrics and message can be hard to catch and enigmatic, but it becomes clearer with each subsequent listen.  This album is far from intellectual jibberish.  I can listen to Kid A continuously and always find something new.  Simplicity and complexity in every track.  I prefer Amnesiac to Kid A, but both are absolutely essential and astounding.  If you do not own either of these albums, you are seriously missing out on some of the best music ever created.  Yes, it seems weird if you haven't been exposed to anything like this before.  Different, challenging and beautiful; with a few listens you will be in awe.
