B00AMBH70S|5.0|Didn't think I'd like it with a new actor in the Bourne series but Jeremy Renner rocks this movie.. I really loved it and enjoy it immensely.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|This could have been a VERY funny movie, if the marketing team wasn't plagued by the same bug that most comedy movie marketers are infected with. Why? WHY?! Does marketing team, after marketing team, after marketing team insist on releasing countless teasers and trailers that give away every joke leaving only a poorly concieved and predictable \\"plot line\\" to be experienced once the viewer actually gets to see the movie? I tried desperately not to expose myself to any Ted previews because I was admittedly excited to see the movie. I went as far as to change channels when they aired on TV, left sites and YouTube videos that used them as Pre-roll, and left theaters when they aired prior to movies. Yet I was still exposed to so many that they ruined the movie. I a glad that I had amazon credit to watch this so it cost less than $2, but I cannot get the time back that I wasted.<br /><br />This was the straw that broke the camal's back, from now on I will just watch every trailer for these comedic movies FOR FREE and laugh out loud at them--I will never rent or purchase another comedy unless the advertising tactics change.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Good movie, I enjoyed it but I won't probably be watching the rest of the series when it comes out. I find the topic a tad disturbing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was so into this book that I read it in like 2 days & couldn't seem to put it down!
B005DOKIYG|1.0|Simply not useable compared to all the similar items available with many more features.  A minimal effort.  Not worth buying.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Questions your have?  This will answer them.  Have a math issue or any other general question, then just word it right and the answer is yours.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all three in six days, I enjoyed the relationship that forms out of odd beginings. It starts off slow but stick with it you wont be disapointed.
B005V20JKI|5.0|This is a very addictive platform game.  It's not the kind of game where you're trying to get from point A to point B,  but rather you're hopping around on different platforms that are on the screen.  The goal is to collect muffins for this fairy.  Every time you collect a muffin,  your character changes into something.  You start off as a knight but you'll change into many different characters and will have to adapt to that character's skills.  Animals and monsters will run towards you,  so you have to either avoid them,  or use your skill to stop the monsters.  My favorite is when my character turns into a unicorn that makes rainbow poop,  which work like landmines to kill whatever monsters run into it.  Also the jackolantern,  who rolls his head down the platforms.<br /><br />It's exciting because you can make a mistake and have to start the level over at any minute.  It's relaxing because the goal to reach is X amount of muffins,  not a destination.<br /><br />The controls are very easy to use.  There a left and right button for your left thumb,  and an action and jump button for the right thumb.
0425252868|5.0|Downloaded on my Kindle....<br /><br />I do not enjoy movies or books about war BUT I was captivated by the book....the story, the men involved, the ending.....brought tears to my eyes.....I could not put the book down.....read it in less than 24 hours....everytime I quit reading to eat or whatever, I could not wait to get back to see what happens next and ended up reading until around 4:00 in the morning....Thanks for the honesty.  Patty:)
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Great for traveling and holds an impressive amount of charge. The device itself charges quickly. I always keep in in my travel bag.
B008LY9AWG|1.0|I usually like his books but I deleted this before finishing it.  It just didn't hold my interest.  I'm sorry.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|The best MI movie in the series, if you ask me.  Tons of action, great cast, and exciting to watch.
B00136NSUO|5.0|Annie Lennox is in top form here. Dark Road is a marvelous song, dark and beautiful,and her vocal chops are on full display in Big Sky.<br />This master musician/singer song writer/composer never fails to amaze and inspire.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft I even have it on my ipod;xbox;kindle and computer. I could never live without it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!my nabors interduced it to me.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|This group definitely will be taking home the hardware at the CMA'S! Song writing chops, great blend of harmony, and a very entertaining listen to boot!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Started reading this book out or curiosity as I'm more of a murder mystery gal and I'm so glad I did. Could not put it down!
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Definitely worth the read.  Parents be warned...offensive language.  Not your typical baseball story.  A must if you like rooting for the underdog.
B008JFUUQ2|3.0|I watched this with my Wife and kids (aged 12 and 14) over the Christmas holidays. It is a straightforward fun movie with funny moments and good musical numbers. I wouldn't put it in my top ten list, however my wife and daughter give it two thumbs up.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|A well written journey that forces us all to contemplate our own journey.  Coelho masterfully draws you in and leads you on a journey of the soul.
B000SP1SH6|4.0|What would any of us do if we had the chance to live a day over?  It took Bill multipe attempts to learn what life is about.
B009JBZH54|5.0|It was his Christmas gifted.He was asking for it as soon as he know it was coming out.sp i got it for him.HE LOVE IT.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Fantastic filming - see more each time you view.  Finally the underdog wins.  Wish this had happen in some of the old westerns.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Amazing, this book was everything I had hoped for and more. I can't wait to start reading the next one.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This novel was both compelling and entertaining. It also made you think about relationships of spouses and parent-child. Would recommend it to anyone who is not looking for a who done it thriller but more of a dramatic story.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This was an interesting topic to tackle in a book. The author did a good job even though I felt it could have been a bit shorter. I'm glad I kept reading because the ending was something to think about.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|the package came on time as ordered- blue ray 8 discs at a great price. would recommend it for anyone who likes Harry Potter!
B00881VLCE|5.0|A great app for young kids. There are 4 different sizes of puzzles pieces that you can choose from and it will keep them busy. Very easy to use. Only thing I don't like is that there is a pop up app that comes up before you play the game. (this might happen to most games) but just have to use caution or get to the game first then hand it over to the little one
B004VYYA2K|5.0|This is great to zip up and keep Barbie things in. It can also be used as a little pretend doll house. My 5 yr old was too spoiled for that and needed a &#34;real doll house&#34;. But, there are lots of little girls that would have been thrilled to have this to play with! It is worth the money even for a child that wants a &#34;real doll house&#34;. The lid can be taken off and use for a swimming pool for the dolls beside it, or put on it for a roof. One side is unzipped and put down for an entryway. It's really great if you are travelling and need to take only something small for a child to play with, and yet have a &#34;lot&#34; to play with.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I've read a lot of Nelson DeMille books and I can honestly say that I was disappointed in this book.  I did laugh at his great humor but the story was boring.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read many WWII novels. This was the first where I learned about the Fascist movement in Great Britain. I enjoyed the story lines of all the characters and how they were intertwined. 5 stars because it kept my interest over the holidays.
0061992860|4.0|Nothing beats 'How to Stay Alive in the Woods' by Brad Angier, but this comes in as a close second. Easy to throw in a backpack, and chock full with a myriad of situations we hope to never get into. Well worth it!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Item was priced fairly and arrived on time and in perfect conditions.  I would not hesitate to buy from this seller again.  This movie will be a classic and is certainly one of the best 3D films yet made.  The visuals and sound are stunning.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There is no flaw in this book what so ever. I absolutely love this book. It almost brought me to tears when Rue died.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Didn't know quite what to expect when I bought it, but really appreciate how easy it makes using the Kindle pretty much hands-free.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put this book down!! It only took me a day to read. Can't wait to read the second one!!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Having finished Proof of Heaven a week ago, the book didn't stay with me very long.  I wasn't sure why, but there were some factors that maybe together drew me to that result.  There was some tedious repetition and an attempt to make this read like a fictional novel with the play-by-play of events that occurred during the coma period.  Also, the spiritual vision was extremely bizarre, and being a Christian I found it strange regarding the absence or mention of Jesus throughout the experience.  Having read a bit on life after life experiences, many divulge that common thread.  However, Eben's experience did capture the pervasiveness and enormity of love he felt, and truly God is love.  Nevertheless, his spiritual experience seemed incomplete.<br /><br />His recall supposedly was knife-edged keen concerning the events and a grasp of universal knowledge, but what really did he learn regarding how we are to conduct our lives? In other words, I would have expected something on our purpose such as caring and sincerity for your neighbor.  After finishing, a day or two later I felt hungry again.
0385535147|5.0|From a great author and not a disappointment either.  Makes a good gift for anyone liking this genre or this author.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Pros:<br />Intricate plot with each chapter told from the perspective of a different character<br />Lots of lore - you know the author didn't just copy an existing world and write another Twilight type story.<br /><br />Cons<br />There are a lot of characters, you will get a barrage of names and details that may seem excessive. I ask myself - do I need to memorize the 20 names that were just thrown at me? If they are not important to the story, why are they introduced?<br /><br />Too many details - this is subjective, but like the above, I may not be concerned that a character's hand has 20 wrinkles or 19. Sometimes the details are useful, sometimes you wonder why you are being given them. 3 leaves or 4 leaves fell off of a tree...&#34;some&#34; or a &#34;few&#34; leaves fell off of a tree would be sufficient.<br /><br />I'm nitpicking though, this is another good book in a good series. I saw the 1st 2 seasons of the show before I read the 1st 2 books, and must say that I like the books more.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I would definately recommend this product! Its so flippin cute in pink and it protects my baby ( my kindle fire) very well! I was a little apprehensive because i did not want to spend 30$ on another case that I might not like but after receiving it, I am impressed and it was definately worth the money! 5 stars!!!*****
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can understand that a lot of people like myself buy a book which has been on the best sellerlist for such a long time but when people continue to buy in to the series of book I wonder why
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Did not receive in the mail. Was it coming a different way???? Let me know how it was sent so I can trace.
0143119680|5.0|If you love history and fantasy and science and logic, then this book is a must. It twists the old traditions and just when you think you know were the plot is heading, POW! You're wrong and so happy about it. I even paid full price for the second book!
B007FJFDXS|4.0|no too complicated... but EXTREMELY challenging  the graphics aren't overdone, but mesh well with the concept, and the idea.  overall, this is a great game, and I spend a lot of time playing it.
B005D63ICI|5.0|While it's a little slower than the other seasons of Dexter, it's still well worth the watch. No need to waste the extra $ on HD. I bought SD and played it through my BRD player and the quality was picture perfect. Not a huge Julia Stiles fan myself but found her tolerable in this.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I watched the movie recently, and decided I had to read the books as a result.  The three books are all written so well, with such amazing detail and feeling behind them that they suck you in.  The world that this story takes place in would be hard to imagine if it weren't for the expertise in the writing. I do not reread books frequently, however, I will reread these three many more times.
1452101248|5.0|Vibrant photographs, really good recipes made with simple (or not so simple) ingredients but with an amazing and tasting result.<br />I recommend to people who doesn't care about butter, cheese ou oil in our food, I mean, it's a book to people how is not in a diet.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|Nice data presentation; better than TWC, but . . . .it's limited in anything other than local weather for a given spot.  No &#34;big picture&#34; maps or explanation of the phenomena.<br /><br />Fine in you want to know the weather in Podunk, but if like to know what the driving conditions are between here and Podunk, it's not easy to get.<br /><br />Limited international information -- very few locations in South America, for instance.
1451696191|5.0|It came at the right time, is a great book and recommend it to all my friends. Loved it !
B0052RDHTM|5.0|very enjoyable and informative read. Follett's characters are down to earth people that are easy to relate to. Highly recommend.
0545265355|5.0|Such great books, it came at the right time, and every person in my family read it and everyone loved it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent and kept me interested on what would happen next. Can't wait for the movie, you know there will be one...lol
B007V65R54|5.0|Forget where I first learned of this book but had been on my list a while.  With topics ranging from baseball to earthquakes the information is never dull.  Supplementing the info with math (mainly statistics) was presented in an easy to understand fashion (disclosure: I hold two degrees in engineering).  Definitely a thought-provoking read that could change your daily personal or business<br />life.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was a John Grisham book. A fun/ easy read. Thanks John! Let me know when the next lawyer book is ready.
1451629184|5.0|I keep this book because it reminds me to be vigilant wherever children are, whether they're my own or someone else's. Jaycee's childhood and teen years were dictated to her by some mentally ill people; it is something no one can erase.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Really nice size for how much it cost.. I can't believe how amazing the sound this thing can push out!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved the quick wit of the characters. It has been an extraordinarily long time since a book has made me laugh and cry with such regularity. I also believe that my vocabulary improved dramatically.
B007SGM084|3.0|Just starting to read this but so far, it's like soft porn.  A control freak and a young virgin...oh, well...
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really liked this game. I can't wait to see what happens next.<br />This game makes it intrestiing because you find things and you have the puzzle part also.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I like to keep my Kindles charged so that I can pick them (2) up at any time and start reading, so buying this was great!
B00005LOUP|5.0|I ordered this for my son.He loves it.It's very funny.I love to sit down and watch it with him every christmas.I have looked for it for along time.So glad you had it.Thank You Seller.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I liked this movie but, it should've come out right after the last Bourne movie with Matt Damon, which would've shown a better connection to the Bourne series. This movie has it's points, like the great chase scenes but the movie doesn't explain a lot about the new Bourne character which leaves the movie watcher wondering and trying to fill in the blanks. Better luck next time?
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND IT'S HIS FAVORITE MOVIE I THINK.VERY AFFORDABLE PRICES.GLAD THAT I FOUND IT FOR HIM.AND ORDERED IT.I'M VERY PLEASED THANK YOU SELLER..I HAVE NEVER SEEEN THE MOVIE.BUT WILL WATCH IT WITH MY HUSBAND.WITH A BOWL OF HOT POPCORN SOON.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This dictionary is very helpful you can just look up a word and it tells you the definition of it!!! This is a great book.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I play on my Kindle Fire and it's a lot of fun, but after two or three games, I have no more &#34;credit&#34; to play for another day. I know the point for the company is to BUY the credits, but I wish you earned more or earned them faster as you play.
B000002ITW|2.0|The sound of this CD is harsh and at times painful, ironic considering that back in its day this was a demo record at most HiFi stores.  Considering the $20 price for a 40 yr old recording I expected a quality, up up date digital to analogue remaster, sadly it's not the case here. And the music industry execs whine and complain how tough things are?
B005I64U5C|3.0|Well, Ryan Reynolds is great to look at, and the 3D makes it fun.  It does enough to let the characters be a part of the movie experience.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|The Kindle Fire HD was a gift for my daughter who loves to read and draw.  I got this app for her and she absolutely loves it and has created some amazing drawings with it!
B005IZLPME|4.0|I went to see this in the movie theater as a last resort.  No expectations, and boy, was I blown away.  I love the period, the bad guy, and of course the transformation of Captain America.  Just love it.
B009VB998I|4.0|Love the video, but got charged double for getting this while we were 1st learning how to purchase and download.  Disappointing that there wasn't something to block a double charge.  Why would anyone purchase it twice?
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Of course, I got the movies because it was the finale in the series.  But, for some reason, I am not as high and mighty about it as the rest of the world.  I prefer the first two, but I do love the ending scene and how the story got there.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|My kids like it and it's free, so I'm okay with it.  Nothing exciting or interesting to me, so I wouldn't have paid for it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Honest and inspiring account of a young women's journey toward healing after engaging in self-destructive behavior following the death of her mother,
B005HSL626|3.0|My kids like it.  And it's free.  So I'd recommend it for the kiddos.  Wouldn't get it for me though.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Fantastic game of matching like tiles. It helps to have a good memory. Each game takes 5 to 15 minutes
B00961ZGQC|3.0|I downloaded this for my 5 year old who heard this while playing Just Dance and that's all we get to listen to now despite other songs also downloaded.  Argh. :-)  What can I say?  Carly Rae has a big 5 year old fan.
B007N85POS|5.0|This version of Angry Birds is my favorite because I like the challenge of trying to get all of the secret awards.  And, I like freeing the birds rather than killing the Pigs.  Nasty pigs!
B0063IH60K|4.0|My download for me on my daughter's device.  Good for long trips at night.  I would recommend getting this one.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I find the joystick option a little difficult to use, but overall for a free version of the game it satisfies my retro video game needs.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|not written very well;  to much shooting; nice special effects;<br />shallow, story not developed well, not as good as the original
B00942Y35S|5.0|I really love this movie, you have to watch it yourself. Is all about the beauty of you, the inner you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best place to find recipes, ideas for kids, home decor,anything you can dream about! It's easy to use and I love it! Have to be careful though...you can lose hours at this site!
B005EHILV4|4.0|This plugs right into your computer and works great with any DAW. Perfect for recording vocals or an instrument. I just wish the high mid and low mixers were knobs and not sliding switches.
B004WE01YA|1.0|They put it under 5 disc combo but it was only a blu ray disc not blu ray 3d or dvd or any of what it said
1423101499|4.0|I did not find anything wrong with the service and the package arrived in a timely manor. Stupid word minimum.
0060872675|5.0|My son agrees, the most chew-able book.<br /><br />There is a little more than is in thud.  The illustrations are fine for the children's book, the portray Vimes as looking rather like Tommy Lee Jones.
0375869026|5.0|My nine-year-old loved this book so much she barely put it down over Christmas break and now wants to buy a copy for her school library.  She insisted that I read it also, which I now am!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was purchased as a gift for a man. The person is a sci fi buff and absolutely loved it.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Great book. I loved the personal stories. Tried a few of the recipes and had one fabulous success and one miserable failure. Not sure if it was me or the recipe. Gonna keep trying more recipes.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really liked 'The Mark of Athena' because it's one of the thicker Rick Riordan books. It lasts a bit longer and it is a terrific story.
030758836X|3.0|I was not thrilled with this novel.  I felt the author did not know when to quit.  It is pretty much forgettable.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love Jeff Kinney's books, but they are such short reads! A true winner would be a book including such a humorous viewpoint of the middle school years but being long enough so it take  time to read.
1609611543|5.0|Awesome.  Have started to see a difference in how my stomach feels already!  Would recommend to everyone.  Wheat is the problem.  definitely a more natural approach and feels so much better on the body in general.  Everyone should give this at least three weeks to feel how much better they will be.  Trying to get whole family on board now!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Not as mind blowing as the first book but alot of info is revealed in here. cant wait to read the next one!
B007IQX1G4|1.0|it's been months since we watched this move, yet still, just the mere glance of the cover makes me cringe into a downward spiral of depression ..... the acting was good I suppose but the storyline was depressing and gloomy. And I L-O-V-E Patton Oswalt but I have a permanent brain scar from seeing his shriveled, naked body parts on camera.  Watching this movie felt like being stuck overnight in a dreary MInnesota airport with no coffee and no Internet.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|Yeah, I understand the idea about making money on a 'free app' but this game is INSANE. One pet you can get costs around 75 dollars. Consider my mind blown. Prices for other things are similar. Someone needs to remind these jerks that these are pixels, not actual products.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is the most exciting.  I loved every show.  I can't wait until it starts back after the break
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Not really a reggae fan but cnat help tapping my toes and humming along the some of the better songs on the collection. I can visualize sitting on the beach with and an umbrella drinkg and a smoke. Marlrey, take me away. BY the way, I didn't shoot the sheriff either.
B000YFH3SI|5.0|Must have additional resource to the reading of &#34;Good to Great&#34; by Jim Collins. Really opens up the mind to real life thought processes.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Movie is during the same timeframe as the last Bourne so its has some continuity with the previous storylines. Plenty of action with evil CIA and government types. As with most action movies, i doubt anyone; drug enhanced or not would make through the first reel without a trip to the morgue. Suspend logic and enjoy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I started reading a few chapters of it a few years back from a friends copy but didn't get to finish it then. Ever since, I've been on the lookout for a copy (in my budget). I was grateful when a friend of mine gifted me the ebook the other day. So grateful that I dropped the few books that I was reading at the time to open this one up. I'm glad I started it because I didn't want to put it down from the beginning.<br /><br />I think what really drew me into this book was Charlie's character and his voice. Because this book is written as a series of letters \\"to the reader,\\" the flow was smooth throughout its entirety and there was a nice conversational tone to it all. I think this was one of the few times when I've enjoyed a book that uses the 2nd person point of view so often. I'm sure this is because, while Charlie is telling \\"you\\" (the reader) his story, there's more first person narrative to balance it all out. The main character only put the \\"you\\" into the writing only when it is necessary. And it is necessary for this book because Charlie is confiding in the reader who he is writing these letters for.<br /><br />For the story itself, I think that many teenagers and former teenagers, alike, would be able to identify with aspects of Charlie's character or at least with some of the topics brought up. A good amount of people were the awkward kid in high school. Or didn't really know how to make friends. Or at least have noticed that people like this exists. In The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Chbosky writes such a believable, in-depth account of one teenager's first year in high school.<br /><br />Charlie is smart, (almost overly) observant, and has a heart of gold, but he can't always get out of his own head to experience life the way that he'd like to. Even when he finds a group of kids who get him for who he is and gets comfortable, Charlie isn't perfect and Charlie doesn't always open up to them. I can't tell you how easy it was to put myself in his shoes when thinking back to my own experiences.<br /><br />So in a sense, my enjoyment for The Perks of Being A Wallflower came from a nostalgic feeling. But that wasn't all that was there. It really felt like Charlie was writing these letters and not the adult Chbosky doing this for a book. The book was a young adult reaching out to whoever would listen because he wasn't able to open up to people closer to him, as much as on a page. I enjoyed seeing his growth and his self-discovering through every step of this particular year in his life.<br /><br />Was I a teenager who went out with friends, drinking and experimenting with various drugs? No, that wasn't me. But did I feel connected to how human the writing in this book made Charlie feel? Of course. Charlie is somewhat of an everyman of his generation. He is the voice of so many young men, and women, just trying to survive being a teenager and to deal with personal struggles.<br /><br />This will be a book that I'll re-read many times to come. I enjoyed it that much.thinking back to my own experiences.<br /><br />So in a sense, my enjoyment for The Perks of Being A Wallflower came from a nostalgic feeling.

B009R8DJ72|5.0|Best yet of them all but that's just what I have to say about it but what do you say about it?
B0042U94UQ|5.0|We love this movie.  We saw it at a drive-in and none of our family had ever heard of it.  It ended up being a wonderful surprise and we bought a copy for Christmas.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Yes, this app is the same as the rest is video records an  takes pictures. It puts those things into the video and pictures areas just fine. The only problem is... I want to post my videos onto youtube. That's really the only reason why I bought my Kindle Fire HD. I didn't want an expensive tablet so I got this. It came with a camera but only for video chating. Really awkward when you try to take pictures with the screen not visible. Is there a way you can make a video recording app that will upload the videos onto youtube?? If not, then I'd rather sell my kindle Fire HD and buy something from Apple like an iPod or something. I'm extremely disappointed with you amazon and the Kindle Fire HD.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I first tried the free version and discovered it is actually quite a fun and entertaining game. I am enjoying this game so much it is definitely worth $2. So far no glitches or force closes and it runs really smooth on my htc mytouch 4g slide.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The rating of my favorite game dungeon hunter 3 kindle edition is the best of all games I playin years
B005M5PENG|3.0|some of the characters are well developed, but seems to be written more to appeal to a broad audience than to be an excellent story. it is a very american tv approach to story telling which most often falls short of it's potential.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|The book is a well known classic that i thought I'd read. It was very good. Lots of passion, anger, jealousy, love. Beautifully written.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved how they went in deep details. I found myself saying,\\"Mom please 5 more minutes. Read for Greek sake!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game a whole lot! Is got very good graphics and the games are hard but pretty easy!
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I bought this product quite awhile ago and didn't realize that I forgot to fix the review! For some odd reason, the free version was compatible with my tablet, while the full version was not. So, I contacted the seller and, after a bit of waiting, it was all patched up! This is absolutely my go-to app. The lines are clean, and the tools are very useful. I definitely recommend this product.
B0033VUH6A|3.0|The problem with renting your movies is that it does not permit  closed captions and therefore I could not fully enjoy it,
B007J4T2G8|5.0|its a awesome book and a wonderful love story. it's a book you won't to put down after reading the first page!
B00APUQH0W|1.0|The story is ok, but the acting and dialogue are atrocious.  I would not recommend watching, Timberlake is awful, even Eastwood is hard to watch.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|i so didnt see half the stuff in this book coming but it makes it even better. this one is my fave for sure!
0374275637|5.0|I am hard pressed to recall another book from which I learned so much about why we are the way we are. Specifically, I value his insights on the implications of our mind's need to paint a complete picture for us immediately -- and how, in particular, this need leads us to grasp points of reference, valid and invalid. We cannot, I believe, change the workings of our minds. We can, however, be aware of how our minds work and attempt to accommodate. Dr. Kahneman gives us this gift.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this book was my fave after reading it and the first. i have read these books like 3 or 4 times now! very goodbooks
B004TI5N38|4.0|A typical David Baldacci novel. Interesting characters and exciting action. Things were rarely what you thought you knew. Kept me going from page one.
B003GAFA8S|5.0|Loved this movie & most of the ones that followed. Love the cast of character's! One of the best series of movies of the 80's !
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is amazing. It comes with a variety of reading plans with different themes. It also has several different translations of the Bible. I highly recommend it.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|It's amazing how well these songs hold up 25 years later, even with dated production (the song \\"Bad\\" in particular). The live concert is a blast, and sound quality pristine. This was a Christmas gift for the BF, but I ended up loving it just as much! The packaging, booklet & extras are well done, too.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Terrific performance by Lawrence and Cooper!!!! The film is messy, it's real and it touches a part of you that knows that you too have little quirks that make you who you are.<br />Lovely and beautiful message of learning to love every aspect of who you are with plenty of laughs thrown in!!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|As an amateur author this work is no &#34;Life of Pi&#34; but as a document of a true experience it is a gift from heaven itself. Engaging, compelling and inspiring all describe the experience in this work for the reader.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Very entertaining.  We liked how the different back ground stories converged into one.  Great CG; enjoyed the humor.  We're glad to have finally decided to watch it.
1594135851|5.0|as with her Hunger Games and Mockingjay, it made you want to read them all over again.  can't say enough about this trilogy! too bad there's no more!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it said I got free points if I rated the game so that's the only reason you are reading this pointless caption.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|as with her other books, this was great, it followed the hunger games storyline seamlessly. great book. would highly recommend to anyone.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is one of the creepiest TV shows or movies of all time.  The acting, writing and directing of this show is amazing.  Jessica Lange is once again amazing!
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|To sum it up, Paranorman (real clever title by the way. They probably came up with the name first and wrote the script around it) is a formulaic romp abounding in a typical story arch of the alienated hero and his overweight sidekick, heavily laced with bad humor for those with ADD and the most confused and contradictory set of morals I've yet seen. *PLEASE NOTE, I'M NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OR REFERENCES TO SEX, VIOLENCE AND HOMOSEXUALITY HERE, JUST EVERYTHING ELSE.<br /><br />***Warning, here be spoilers!***<br /><br />Norman Babcock, a young boy with the ability to speak to the dead, must endure living with his strange gift which no one believes him to possess. He is taunted by the usual cardboard cut-outs of bullies, one of which becomes something of a second side kick later on, and endure his father's disapointment in him. To be fair, the opening to this movie seemed promising. The scene where he's watching zombie movies with his deceased grandmother's ghost was a good enough way to open the movie, as was the scene in which he's walking to school and interacting with the various ghosts who wander in purgatory; the way he interacts with the ghosts, which the audience initially cannot see, bespeaks a certain sense of innocence in young Norman as he greets them. When the audience is allowed to see all the ghosts it makes the movie goer beleive the rest of the movie might include much more talking to the dead. Sadly, this is the most we ever see of Norman using his abilities to speak to the dead and also when the movie peaks. The rest is a slow descent into bad, stupid jokes, and a confused, meandering plot.<br /><br />Norman and his overweight, social misfit friend Neil meet Norman's eccentric Uncle Mr. Prenderghast, a not all together there hobo who tells Norman that he soon must take up a family right of passage to protect the town from the ghost of an evil witch that comes in cycles once every generation.<br /><br />Soon after, while rehearsing a school play about the trial and execution of said witch 300 years earlier, Norman has a vision of encroaching evil. He has the same vision again during the play only with himself as the witch being chased by an angry mob. Naturally, this ruins the play and we have a scene in which his father vents his anger and disapointment at him. At this point I was underwhelmed by the tired father who won't accept his son cliche but I would have let it pass had the rest of the movie been as enjoyable as the first part.<br />Already, you know from my rating it wasn't.<br /><br />Mr. Prenderghast then dies...in comical fashion, and by comical I mean \\"comical.\\" He has a heart-attack, convulses on the floor and then his spirit drifts away, only to land back inside the body for immediate resurection, just like in an old Loony Tunes cartoon, except it's not funny but weirdly morbid. Just when he thinks he's beat his imminent demise he finally croaks and his spirit says, \\"Ah, nuts,\\" or something to that effect just to imply that THIS IS FUNNY! Except it's still morbid and whatever humor is there is forced. Unfortunately, this isn't the last time Prenderghast's death is made light of, more on that later.<br /><br />Norman is then visited by Prenderghast's ghost at school. Wacky hijinks ensue as Prenderghast pops out of toilet and splashes water all over the place. Prenderghast then tells Norman that soon he must fulfill his destiny of staving off the cyclical evil occurrence from wreaking havoc on the town by reading from a special book. This book, as it happens, was in the hands of Prenderghast when he died...you can pretty much see where this will lead. Prenderghast, his conscience clean, then passes on to the afterlife despite Norman's insistence that he needs more help and information to go on other than just, \\"read from this special book where the witch is buried!\\" Prenderghast then departs in a explosion of light which wrecks most of the bathroom, implying that whenever a soul passeson after fulfilling its unfinished business an unexplainable explosion occurs. Okay, Weird...<br />Prenderghast just seems like a jerk here. \\"Norman! You have a special destiny, have a nice day!\\" *Poof!* If there was any justice in the universe, God wouldn't have let him pass on but forced him to stay and help Norman. Lord knows a ghost sidekick might have spiced up this movie.<br /><br />Norman then departs for his deceased Uncle's house so he can pry away the special book from his rigor mortis stricken corpse. We get that funny scene from Young Frankenstein of trying to wrench a book from dead hands except it's not funny and is painfully prolonged to distasteful lows, such as his Uncle's corpse falling on Norman, his lolling tongue slaping his face.<br /><br />Norman then takes the book to the cemetary with the sketchy instructions he got from his Uncle to read the book at the place where the witch from 300 years earlier was buried. He opens the special book only to discover that it is an ordinary book of fairy tales (keep this in mind later as I'll be ranting about it). Before he can do this, Norman's bully, Alvin intrudes. Soon after, a storm brews and the clouds take on the sinister appearance of a witch. The ghost witch the uses its powers to raise the zombiefied bodies of seven Puritan judges whom she cursed when they sentenced her to death. They flee the scene only to run into Norman's bratty, teenage sister stereotype who was looking for him along with Neil and his older brother jock stereotype. The zombies chase them into town and soon after Norman deduces that the ritual to stop the witch did not work since he was not at the place where the witch was interred. He calls up the brainy, condescending, glasses wearing stereotype who informs him that witchs are buried in unmarked graves. The only way he can find the whereabouts of her unmarked grave-let me repeat that-HER UNMARKED GRAVE, is to go to the Town Hall archives to learn its location...............HER UNMARKED GRA-If the witch's grave is unmarked then why in the hell would its location be listed in any of the archives! Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of it being unmarked!<br /><br />Oh, well.<br /><br />The kids make their way to the Town Hall archives with the zombies still in pursuit. Let's do a quick head count of the kids and their stereotype before we continue further. We've got the quiet, alienated hero, the fat kid, the bully, the jock and the bit of teenage, female Americana. That sounds like a real motley crew. Maybe afterwards they can all go look for One-Eyed Willy's treasure!<br /><br />The kids manage to break into the Town Hall in the futile attempt to find the location of the aforementioned UNMARKED GRAVE! while the zombies, baffled and beguiled by modern society freak out and cause a town wide panic eventually culminating in a violent mob, complete with torches and pitchforks. There's supposed to be a bit of poetic irony here in that the zombiefied Puritans are finding themselves at the other end of the pitchfork but I'm too preoccupied with the idea of going to the Town Hall in the 0.0000000000000000000000001 percent chance that they'll learn the location to an UNMARKED GRAVE to notice.<br /><br />The violent mob eventually reaches the Town Hall where the children have barracated themselves. Norman, in his frustration, abandons the attempt to learn the witch's whereabouts to try to confront the witch in the clouds overhead himself. This might seem like a fruitless endeavor, if only trying to learn the location of an UNMARKED GRAVE weren't already more so. With a violent storm brewing and an angry mob all around, Norman then climbs the spire of the Town Hall in order to try and read fairy tales from a story book to an angry, wicked witch face in the clouds. I really, really wish I was making this up.<br /><br />Come to think of it, if all he needed was to read fairy tales then why did he need this one special book? Couldn't he have justgone to any Barnes & Noble and bought a copy of Grimm's Fairy tales? Come on! Also, per Norman's decision to confront the witch their whole trip to archives, which has now taken up a pretty good chunk of the movie, is now rendered pointless. *que image of unsharpened pencil*<br /><br />Norman is then hit by a lightning bolt and blacks out. During his unconsciousness, he dreams that he is the witch being persecuted by the Puritan judges as he stands in their semi-circle of fear and loathing. He then learns that the witch wasn't really a witch at all but a girl his age who was condemned because they feared her awesome psychic abilities. The little girl goes from frightened to frighteningly angry as she vows to get revenge on them all.<br /><br />Norman wakes up and is confronted by the zombie puritans who, as it turns out, did not want to munch on his brains but rather talk to him as Norman, being able to talk to the \\"dead\\" would be the only one able to talk to them. I put dead in quotes because the zombies are not ethereal and are visible to everyone else, and also because Norman, in additition to being a medium, also apparently has the ability to understand the zombie moaning and groanings as some kind of necrophonic language. Only a portion of Norman's abilities are being used here since other people can see the zombies and it's by now it's been ages since we've seen Norman speak with a ghost. Norman could have just had the ability to talk to zombies and this movie's convoluted plot wouldn't have missed a beat. The zombies, as it turns out, are totally sorry for being so mean to the little girl who has now cursed them with living death and is now causing violent thunderstorms that treaten to kill the citizenry. They tell Norman that as the only one able to speak to the dead it's up to him to \\"put the little ghost girl back to sleep by reading her fairy tales.\\" WTF?<br /><br />Because reading Fairy Tales to an evil ghost child to \\"put it to back sleep\\" regularly was a stupid idea in the first place, Norman vows to find a more permenant solution. He visits the little girl who is named Agatha for a final confrontation. Agatha actually looks kind of badass at this point. She has glowing, spiky yellow hair and her ghost body is crackling with electricity. The moral of this movie up to his point is that it's wrong to persecute people who are different out of mere fear, but honestly, if a little girl could go Super Saiyan I'd be pretty afriad of her too. Granted, not enough to kill her but, yeah.<br /><br />Norman tries to talk sense in Agatha by telling her that her blind resentment towards her executioners has made her into a bully no different than they. By giving into her anger, she lowers herself to their level and thus continues, in perpetuity, the cycle of fear mongering and persecution.<br />Dude, that is so deep! Oh, excpet for the part where we're told to not hate on people who murder a little girl!<br />Agatha's violent electrical storms then reach a climax as there is a bright flash of light followed by several seconds of hushed silence.<br /><br />So it's come down to a \\"quiet moment,\\" eh? Well, to quote the Nostalgia Critic when he reviewed Little Nemo, \\"No, nothing you have done so far warrents a quiet moment!\\" We're then treated to a touching seen of Agatha with her mother and her happiest memories sitting by a tree. She feels comforted by Norman who knowns how it feels to be an outcast with unique abilities and let's go of her anger. Able to move on, Agatha departs for the afterlife, along with the zombies, whose corpses mysteriously vanish too (no explaination given), and everything is restored to normal...well, except for the thousands in property damage. The movie closes with a happy ending and Norman's sister Courtney hits on the jock, Mitch by asking him to go to a movie with her, to which Mitch replies, \\"My boyfriend loves chick flicks!\\" Sadly, out of all the stupid, fast paced humor, this was the funniest joke in the whole movie, but also the one blemish which is twisting the panties and/or magic underwear of all the WASPs and Mormon who, even as you are reading this are angrily typing negative reviews for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />Paranorman was a terrible movie. It's pacing was bad, it's characters were dull, it's morals were confused and it's humor was terrible at best. It's sad because some of the ideas presented in the plot were interesting. The idea of this ghost girl finding redemption would have been wholly unique were it not for the fact that Brave, an animated movie with way better story, character development and jokes, had done a redemption story first and way better.<br /><br />This Movie's \\"morals\\" were so confusing. In the end, it was wrong to persecute Agatha and call her a witch, even though she pretty mcuh was; it was wrong to fear her, even though those same fears ended up being validated; it's wrong to hold a grudge against bigoted, religious fanatics for the apparently small crime of killing a child; the classic depiction of witchs as ugly crones is false, even though an ugly crone was clearly visible in the clouds, cackling madly; and lastly...uh...don't persecute and alienate weirdos or else they might turn emo and go postal on your ass. Seriously, this movie is so messed up in the moral department that virtually no one is innocent. Everyone is guilty of some crime but we're told that they were really innocent the whole time. I call bull on this.<br /><br />I really don't understand how this movie could be so popular with all the plot holes and story archs that went nowhere. I went into this movie with high hopes. Those hopes have just furiously typed this review.gone to any Barnes & Noble and bought a copy of Grimm's Fairy tales? Come on!

B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Although this movie deals with a much needed topic, I find it to be a slow dance around dealing with it. What is meant as humor turns out to be boring and mundane chatter. The talent that Streep and Jones have between them was wasted and smothered by poor writing and direction. I am glad they did deal with the breakdown in marriages ans communication within but IT expected far more! Soooo glad I didn't buy this movie.<br /><br />Disappointed in VA
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is on the same line as fifty shades.  I loved it.  I bought book one in paperback as soon as I finished I needed book two which I purchased on the kindle.  I was disappointed to find out when I went to buy book three it is not available until may 2013.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This is one of those where there should be negative stars.  I clicked on the little purchase button and there is a one click to spend $99 on some items for the game.  This is wrong on so many levels.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The fact that it syncs all of your devices that have the app to contain the same information is my favorite feature. This app is incredible and trumps all other notepad type apps I have come across so far.
B004JM8X5E|4.0|A must see. Great acting. Great storyline. A special boy who's mom was struck by lightning, gets electromagnetic powers and proves himself to bullies at school.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|One of my favorite CDs.  You will not be disappointed in the least.  This is truly inspiring and captivating.  BUY IT!
B00422LESO|4.0|As a fan of Jane Austin novels (and Colin Firth), I couldn't but help pick up this book. It's great light reading and I love the subtle humour and the adventure the main character goes on in the fantasy world of Jane Austin...I love how, somehow even those who want to deceive themselves the most are probably the most honest at the end of the day.
0761163808|5.0|We have a lot of kids on various sides of the family and they are spread out all over the country.  Saw this book in local bookstore and knew that it would be a hit (Amazon price was about 40% lower).  Gave this to several kids in 6 to 13 age range and all of them loved it.  Photos really are amazing.
B007ZTN07O|2.0|I purchased a really cheap Android tablet by Polaroid of all companies, and decided to test its limits. I knew fighting games were supposed to be terrible for touch-devices, but being a huge fan of the genre, I just had to take a gander at what SNK had to offer on the device.<br /><br />Peculiarly, the game's p2p fights are handled through a social networking venue. It's not a terrible thing, and if you're not really into the multiplayer portion, you won't even have to bother past signing up. Don't pay attention to the other reviews that say it's a scam; it's just the way you're able to matchmake.<br /><br />Anyway, once it finally installed, the app continued crashing every time I tried to run it. However, rebooting the entire tablet fixed that problem. What it failed to fix, however, is the gameplay. The game looks and sounds great, especially for a handheld, and with my glasses off it almost looks like it's running on much more powerful hardware. But controlling your fighter is almost impossible. Considering the fact that I've been playing fighters for over 20 years and have put in a decent chunk of time on the PS3 version of this game (KoF XIII), I shouldn't have to struggle in pulling off a QCF. I struggled so much, in fact, that I was only able to perform a *real* special move (as in, without the shortcut), once. This is unacceptable. The AI also takes a gigantic leap when you get to the sub-boss, who as I recall wasn't even close to this hard on the consoles. What makes matters worse is the fact that the battles before him are almost laughable even with the terrible controls, and then you get someone thrown at you that cremates your team in seconds.<br /><br />Fighting games are a paltry lot on the Android, even in comparison to its cousin over at Apple.  To make matters worse, this version has less characters than the current iOS version, which makes this one seem like more of a joke in comparison. When the ground isn't so fertile for these things, you can'tafford to make such boneheaded mistakes.<br /><br />I hope whatever comes down the pipeline in the future - in KoF or anything else - has a bit more care taken into it.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|I've never been a \\"fantasy\\" movie person but these movies take you into a fictional time, that after watching you kinda think it may have really happened for a moment. I highly recommend all three of these movies.<br />KS
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Grandson loved the movie and anything Cars. Could not pass it up. He loved it so much on my Kindle Fire.
1451695195|5.0|This book is fascinating to read! It's written for the average person to understand. (I was concerned that it would be filled with medical terminology and that I would need a copy of Grey's Anatomy to translate it.) This book really made me think in ways I never before considered. It's comforting to think there's something more beyond the physical...
2090338482|5.0|This workbook contains excellent exercises and explanations of French grammar.  It is a great addition to any textbook. Excellent series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so much fun!!! And addicting!!! :) it is awesome too because it's free! I hope to see many more games made by the same people!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Gave this as a gift because my aunt loved the show and would watch it every time they had reruns.  Plan on watching the DVDs myself sometime soon.
1580084621|4.0|Great starter book and highly recommended to me by someone who teaches Thai cooking.  Gives a great background detail of Thai food and the culture of Thai food.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Don't waste your time with this game.  Twice I have gotten into 80 plus levels only to open the game and discover that all of my progress had been lost.  There is no way to go back, you just have to start over.  If you do decide to play, please don't spend any money on the game.  It will all be wasted when the game defaults back to the beginning and all your money and hours of time have disappeared.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|bought the whole three book series for my kids, who thoroughly enjoyed reading the books.  Thank you very much.  The process to purchase the books was very quick and easy.
B007I1Q4W2|4.0|Exit Humanity is an exceptional fantasy/horror and quite possibly the most intelligent zombie flick I've ever seen.<br /><br />This film follows the post-apocalyptic paradigm but with a twist in that the living dead begin appearing at the end of the Civil War and furthermore their origin is supernatural based which provides a refreshing variation however there's still the plague nature of becoming undead which we're all familiar with.  There's the survivor traveling through lonely territory fighting zombies less the cataclysmic devastation replaced with rather pretty scenery, except for the zombies of course, as well as the search for other survivors but the interactions are typically thoughtful, no random shagging (sorry, this isn't a boob-fest) and actually feels more like a fantasy-based quest.<br /><br />It's pretty essential that a story be convincing and Exit does this well, featuring all-around fine performances with special emphasis on the lead played by Mark Gibson.  Additionally, I thought the animated chapter interludes were a cool innovation, the violence isn't over-the-top gross and I think there's like only one F-bomb in the entire film.  :O<br /><br />Too bad this isn't a series cuz it beats Walking Dead hands down.  :o)
B003O86FMW|4.0|bought the whole three book series for my kids, who thoroughly enjoyed reading the books.  Thank you very much.  The process to purchase the books was very quick and easy.
B00170KA0C|5.0|Great period example of one of the Seven Sister Schools in the east and how they churn out brilliant young woman able to do EVERYTHING yet forbidden to do anything non-traditonal. A great feminist movie that's not &#34;in your face.&#34;
B000SEFNMS|4.0|my daughter needed this book for a class assignment.  Thank you very much for making it so easy to purchase
B009MCRHH6|4.0|it's a lot of fun messing with those goo balls and trying to figure out how to build with them, but sometimes they just don't do what you want them to do!!!! argh!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|my daughter truly enjoyed this book and couldnt wait for the movie to come out.  thank you for the prompt shipment
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Since I am a long time fan of Rod's, anything he sings I will buy.  The title song is awesome and worth the price of the album.  He surprised me on the slow ones like Silent Night and Blue Christmas, the latter being connected to Elvis and did it justice.  His rendition of Auld Lang Syne was beautiful.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|bought the whole three book series for my kids, who thoroughly enjoyed reading the books.  Thank you very much.  The process to purchase the books was very quick and easy.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Luv this game it's fun to play keeps you busy for a while<br />I'm sure you will enjoy it everyone should download this it also kills time
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am enjoying game. Searching items in the rooms. Though sometimes touching item does not accept correct answer.<br />This is fun game to learn on. Helps the mind stay active.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Unbelievable.  Saw Led Zeppelin play at what turned out to be there last U.S. show in Oakland in 1977.  The weather was crummy that day, they were late starting do to a big fight with Bill Graham's son and the sound sucked.  The Celebration Day Concert features the three remaining members and Jason Bonham on drums.  The old geezer's nailed it and Jason is simply amazing playing his fathers music.  Worth every penny and you get to sit in your living room without having stoned out of there mind Zep fan's stumbling around you.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Rented then downloaded to an ipad to watch later. Very convenient except it took very long to download. Great movie
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is really entertaining i had a really good time playing it. It really lives up to the description, I highly recommend this game.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|This game is sort of like Balderdash with pictures instead of definitions.  4-6 players. Each player has a handfull of pictures.  The active player for the round selects one of his pictures and announces the clue.  The clue can be anything from one word to the line from a song or movie.  All the other players choose one of their pictures that best matches the clue.  Players vote on which picture is the original picture.  You get points for choosing the right one and points when others vote for your picture.<br /><br />the twist:  As the Active player, if no one guesses the correct picture, you get 0 points.  If everyone guesses the correct picture, you get 0 points.  Your clue has to be easy enough that at least 1 person gets it, but hard enough that everyone won't guess it!<br /><br />We have played this game with all adults and with our children ages 8-12.  It is fun for everyone.  We allow lobbying for the pictures and talk about why each one might fit the clue.  Lots of fun
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great puzzle solving game!  Addictive, but at least it's making me use my brain. Doesn't get old either, love it.
0525953728|5.0|Outstanding! A must read! My heart, without ceasing, will honor and respect the Seals who put their lives in danger for my safety. God bless. And good luck in all your future endeavors!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|New character for David that was developed very well. The story had several twists that surprised you at the end.
B00062PN6I|5.0|we are a production company and do translation.<br />these are comfortable, headband is good, when you get it<br />widen out the band to loosen for more conformable head size.<br />good sound quality, low cost
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. It never gets old. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Jack London books.
0553805371|5.0|I always like to read information which i understand about 50% of it.<br />then I eventually get 40% more. and Hawking has a great mind.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I really like this song and I really like a lot of stuff by coldplay.  I'm glad that I bought this.
1400032717|5.0|Bought as a Christmas present.  I wanted to read it<br />but I had to wrap up and give away.  I am ordering a copy of myself
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I did not realize it was bad boy meets nice girl in college. Thought it should be for younger readers(20ish). I did read it in 2 days and enjoyed it. I liked the end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A very interesting story.  I think the characters are very likeable.  The twist and turns keep you in suspense through out the entire book.  It's a book you have a hard time putting down.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Just when you think Amazon is gonna give us another kids game, they pull this sweet surprise. I checked play store and reviews were not false here. The Internet radio app I was waiting for, works perfectly on Samsung galaxy SII and Note 10.1, thanks Amazon!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The book jumps right in to the story an  kept my interest the whole way through! I would definitely recommend this book.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I give this book five stars because I have been trying to find the perfect dystopian romance novel after reading the books matched and the giver and have finally found it. Delirium is a must-read book for any teenager interested in dystopian societies. Delirium is a sweet mix of Ally Condies book matched and Anna Carey's book Eve.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Simply put this collection is worth owning.  The DVD is wonderful but if you have a Blu Ray player that version is stunning.  Also look at the series LIFE which is also worth owning.  As long as your into this type of series you won’t be disappointed.
0385344333|5.0|I think the latest Jack Reacher novel was a great follow up to the series. I have read them all as they were released and found this one as good as the last. Don't let the poor reviews dissuade you from this book as they seem to be written by people who seem to feel that every page should be full of someone getting beatup or shot. There is some thought required in this story and if you want nothing but violence, get a wrestling magazine. Keep up the great work Lee Child and you left me anticipating your next work and sorry this read was over.
B005DOJ68K|4.0|We had this LP eons ago and it brings back memories of the good times when we were younger and had it blasting out!
B009KHDT0C|1.0|Not a good movie. Not worth watching. Not worth spending even $2 on. My teen daughter even quit watching it with 15 minutes left saying it was a horrible movie. I stuck in there to the end and it wasn't even close to worth it. Johnny Depp what were you thinking????<br /><br />Hated it.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book was great as a teen but think I appreciate the writing more as an adult.  If you have never read now is the time
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I don't recommend books very often, but this one is too good not to. Although the story is told from the dog's point-of-view, and Enzo is smarter than your average dog, he is still a dog nonetheless. I found the characters believable. Even though I don't care for racing, the sport was used metaphorically in many instances. I did learn to appreciate a sport which I never though of as anything more than cars racing around an oval track.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Speilberg approved and participated in the restoration and it shows!  Worth every penny with great detail, depth of field and color.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I've been hearing about this artist for a while and wanted to have a listen. Her voice is so unique and the sounds that come from her music takes you on a journey. Forget all the negative things you hear about her and just try have a hear at her music. This album is like listening to a movie soundtrack.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|If your 10 years old, then perhaps this is one of your very \\"bestest\\" films ever.......but other than that, this is close to being un-watchable for the rest of us. I only viewed it because of Spielberg's direction, but even he couldn't save this pathetic, phony, ridiculous movie. Just not for any person that actually thinks......or even smarter than average cats, dogs or monkeys. Total waste of time.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Excited to find the first season of Modern Family at such a great price. We now own all four season of Modern Family. This show is so funny and I catch new jokes each time I watch it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book is not quite the inspired effort of the Harry Potter series, but it also shows that J.K. Rowling can write excellent books beyond HP. I thought this was an intriguing and unusual book--very British, with perhaps a need to have a feel for life in a small English village to fully appreciate, but worthwhile reading for anyone.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Good movie, well done, But why are they all so dark? Are all movies that are streamed always this dark? Sattelite t.v. movies from Dish are bright with lot's of detail why can't streaming from amazon be as good? Does not compare to Sat. or DVD. If there is something I can do to improve this problem I would give anything to know!
0525952926|4.0|This book is good, but not quite up to the standards of Follett's recent efforts. Still, on an absolute scale it is very readable
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow...that was pretty interesting. Never expected that. Sad ending.vBulletin overall a good book if your not a goofy two shoes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I held until it wasn't popular any more. Well after the release to DVD, and I really wasn't excited about.  The read started out slow and I thought I would set it down and forget it. I gave it a few more pages then ended up finishing the entire book in one day. Luckily I am sitting with a broken foot or I'd have no excuse. If you are holding out, give it a shot being it's free on Amazon for Prime account holders.
B0064NTZKI|4.0|I love the documentary, but I wish it had spanish subtitles. I think its very complete because it introduces Woody Allens life, his personality and how all of this influence in his creativity process
B007CKNX28|5.0|If this was the only CD I owned for the rest of my life I would die happy. It's the best. He's so good in concert too.
B005DD7MH8|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, it even had a cliff hanger at the beginning. He haw just a average guy that had to cope with new intelligence... A lot of people wanted it, and he coped with it and won basicly. There was excitment adventure, and sex.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|As always Nicholas Sparks delivers! Great book just like all the others I have read that he wrote! A must read!
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|I've been reading lots of free e-books, which often means the first book for an author. While many of these are good books, it was refreshing to once again read a seasoned author. This is not stereotypical Stephen King--not a horror novel. There is a thread that keeps you wondering if/when the horror component will kick in. King is just a good writer. I like his style. This book kept me interested, wanting to find out what happened next, never quite sure which way he was going to take the story. An enjoyable read.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I would recommend this movie.  We watched this on New Years Eve before ringing in the New Year.  The whole family loved it.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Glad I didn't go to the theater nad lots of money to see this movie. What a waste!<br />don't get it
B0012FHGCW|1.0|The main character had lots of potential and the promise of that \\"ah ha\\" moment or awakening kept me watching this movie.  But in the end he was not particularly enlightened nor achieved any enlightenment.  Bottom line this was a person who searched for meaning and in the end only realized that food and health were fundamental.  Most of us already know that. I was watching for a bit more.  I do not recommend this movie.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|.<br /> I like games that keep my attention and this one does. I like searching for hidden objects and trying to figure out the mystery.This game gives me all I need
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Wow!  This is the most unique and creative app I've seen in quite some time.  It is quite a lot of fun.  You interact with the game by drawing things within the environment.  For instance use the fire pencil to make a fire that burns whatever its near including potentially you.  There are lots of little puzzles to solve to unlock every level and find all the puzzle pieces.  Can be challenging in a good way too.  I just love the little stick woman and I love the creative aspect of this game.  I got it for free but it is definitely worth a few bucks more so than almost any other app.<br /><br />EDIT:  The only downside is its too short.  I finished it soon after writing the review.  I thought there would be more after I finished the first page of levels, but there isn't.  I wish they would add more levels, because it is really cool.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|Ok this popped up as a free app of the day and so I had to try it out based on the commercial theme from my childhood.<br /><br />So glad I did... starts out simple and ramps up the challenge!
B005QPGHQU|5.0|Love every song on this CD. Even love her playing the harp ... Just love it!!! Go ahead and buy it!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I really do enjoy the game, although where is the winter update that is on android and iOS? I prefer to play on my kindle for screen real estate. but without the update I might switch. will change to 5 stars when update comes out.
B005CRQ2DK|3.0|In my opinion I think the other books were better than this one I think  the  other ones were more funny
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Abercrombie is still doing his thing with Fantasy, which means yet another great book.  Something about it, not quite as good as the First Law Trilogy, but still a fantastic read!
B00ARAO720|3.0|Great Movie, we really enjoyed it!  My daughter is a huge fan of the main character. And this was another very good performance.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Great book, I can't wait for the next one! There was more to the story than I expected, nice to see such a good mix.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|As with many romance novels it was predictable but it was enjoyable. I would read other things by Mira Lyn Kelly.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent sequel! Can't wait to read the last one! I was pleasantly surprised with the entire book. If you liked the first book, you will not be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am hanging. Shocking book, Must-read.  I read it in 2 days Must read book 3 now.  Want to know what happens.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What an awesome read. Had a hard time putting this down. Highly recommend and cannot wait to read the rest of the series.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|This is not a movie,its a con,a criminal enterprise its only purpose is to relieve the public of its hard earned money.
B006YGC7KK|5.0|Great show, great quality, great everything. Its more hd than on tv. This is my favorite live action tv series. It also arrived 3 days before the estimated delivery date. By far the best series on the CW. I would recommend it for any action fans.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It just gets better with each episode.  I will buy season 3 and watch before it runs again on TV
034580404X|4.0|Enjoyed the Trilogy and when one book was finished could not wait to read the next. Hope to read more from this author.
B00846REIS|5.0|Amazing book. I love the passion and connection between Gideon and Eva. Cannot wait to read the entire series. It's going to be torture waiting for the 3rd book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games on here. its so much fun. its similer to temple run but even more fun. trust me its addictive.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing story. Cannot wait for the 3rd book to be released. I am so excited to see where this love story goes from here.
B008N1V11U|4.0|I think it's just as the amazing Spider-Man good graphics I have the amazing Spider-Man and this batman<br /> game plus n.o.v.a 3 and I sure got a steal because I got all three of them for under 3 bucks I got them when they were on sale for .99 cents. I'm just a gameloft lover and always look for the sales. My only deal was that they take up about a third of your kindle fire tablet memory If you have 8Gb. Don't buy it for a ridiculous price of 6.99 look for the steals and I basically only have those three games because they each<br />take about a third of your memory.I also have a serious problem with the amazing Spider-Man game when I exit the game I can go back to play it the next hour and I'll have to restart the whole game from level one and I'm furious because I was already close to the boss lizard please fix gameloft plz help sum one If you know how to solve my problemo.
B0063GORYU|5.0|!!Playing this game at night helps me relax!!! I love it!! I also like that it challenges me, keeps my mind working :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't consider cause this is perfect  i would not change anything i love it and good romantic love story
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was the best by far that I have ever read. I finished it in 1 day and couldn't put it down!
B008OOYALE|4.0|Its a fun game and has better graphics than other dragon games. However, the food and other supplies are hard to get because they cost so many coins.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like the &quot;my alarm clock&quot; sadly it seems I have to pay to get the upgrades. xD just wanted to use the music I already bought to wake me up.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Again, I downloaded this mainly  for my wife. its very convient on the Kindle instead of<br />on my heavy laptop.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is a must read that starts off great and keeps up the suspense till the end. Definitely recommended
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I am getting used to this game more and more,but I am old and didnot know how to play.<br />If it comes with instructions, I could not find them. I had to swallow my pride and ask my<br />Grandson :-(. He still loves me , or he said he does.
157330087X|5.0|It's more than a concert film, so I didn't find the interviews a bothersome interruption, more like valuable tributes to SRV perfectly complementing the musical performances. I especially appreciated hearing BB King, Eric Clapton, and Buddy Guy all marveling at SRV's just pouring out music, like a transmitter, never pausing to think or plan or collect his wits halfway through a solo. I loved Bonnie Raitt here, I loved Dr. John, Robert Cray, brother Jimmie; just everybody \\"showed up\\" and performed generously and bravely in SRV's honor. Filmed and recorded perfectly, too.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I love it so much I would won't to Marry it so badly really it was that good trust my
B003TJR2HS|5.0|After looking around for an adapter to allow me charge my iPhone and play music in my 2008 Mercedes C 300, I finally found this one. It works exactly as designed, and allows me to both charge and stream internet radio into my car from my iPhone 4S. It passes all music and track info into the instrument cluster display. Plug and play, works flawlessly. Highly recommended.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|its an ok passtime. It was free so cant't complain. Good for kids. when i look at screen  for a long time my eyes start to hurt.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I fell in love with the book. The details are spectacular and leaving you wanting to read the second book, catching fire. This story kept my eyes glued to the page. And once you read this, you will the same.
B008K93302|1.0|does not play my wd cloud drive mpg files.  wasted my money.  lousy user interface.  do not waste your money
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Interesting but not very exciting.  Thought it was going to be an espionage novel.  Interesting structure. Maybe got misled by the book description.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I is a great story and each episode is intriguing and draws you on to the next one. Good Work!!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Boring, long, definitely the worst of the series. Not sure what more there is to say about it. See something else!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A book I couldn't put down. Started and finished in the same night. Awesome read! A twist that wasn't expected leaves you not wanting it to end.
B004AUHWLQ|5.0|A classic, well worth seeing again. The writing, the dialogue, the acting, cinematography. Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine are charming. Even the minor characters are well drawn and well acted. Why don't they make movies like this anymore?
B005HSGB6W|5.0|At first I felt that this book would be just another highly overrated piece of literature, but I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful it was written and how innovative the character and storyline is. I would highly recommend this book for a great read that challenges your intellect because the vernacular used in this book is a little out there and at times quite cumbersome.
B008Y2VTIS|4.0|First season was definitely better. The writing is a little more sloppy, the story line and direction feels hurried. But still, if you liked these characters the first time around, it's fun to see how things are evolving. Buscemi is still so good!
B0001CCXGG|5.0|Love the music.<br />I most defiantly will do business with these guys again.  The CD was in great shape when it arrived.<br /><br />Thanks guys!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I really like this Kindle cover.  It gives you a little extra to hold onto.  Both my husband and I use it by folding the cover behind the case.  I have the Kindle Touch version, which is a little smaller than this one.  The Prologue Case cover for the Kindle Fire works fantastic for my husband's older Kindle Keyboard.<br /><br />The Kindles look considerably more classy in these covers than in my previous foam sleeves.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Always a page turner.  Left the door open for a marriage and reunion with his other son.  Keep up the good work.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|The movie was very entertaining! Action packed and it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time!!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I usual don't read Grisham books because I read pelican brief and I hate it.  To my surprise I l like this book. The only thing was I couldn't figure out what main character was doing. I guess that was the point.  I think I would of like it more if I was able to take a guess at what was going on even if I'm wrong.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|This is awesome. Our 4 year old granddaughter loves it. She was able to put most of her xmas presents in it to take home with her. I would recommend it for any girl.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great ending<br />Was excited it turned out the way it did cuz it could have been so different.  But I loved it
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Excellent reading . Told in a way that was very alive. Almost felt I was aboard the boat with them.  I highly recommend this book. You will not  sorry.
B0049GYXDQ|5.0|My three year old daughter LOVES all thongs Disney especially the princesses.  This movie is no exception.  Cute plot, good music and a beautiful princess.  I even found a Tiana cookbook at the library and made a few recipes with her after watching this DVD.  Good times!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I loaded this game for my daughter but love playing it. It was a little hard for my 5 year old because there are no instructions and that is how I got involved playing.  I don't like that you can buy gems and money so easily. If I give the game to my daughter I have to make sure she doesn't buy anything. Overall I like the game but do have some issues with it.
075669812X|5.0|This has kept my 7 year old busy for hours, which is hard to do with him!  It also comes with a minifig and those things aren't cheap.  Check an auction site!
1469984202|5.0|I just finished reading this book today. I can honestly say that it is one of the best I've read.  So while I hate to just pile on, here is a 5 star review from me too! One more thing... I was at the library today and looked up the author.  Guess What? None of his books.  But I saw a recently ordered copy of Wool in the pipeline. Howey's day has come.
B0046MVVOW|5.0|Love the CDs, alot cheaper through here than at any store like Walmart or Best Buy. Plan on getting more here!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|this is the best game ever. they have lots of heroes and powers in the game. GOOD JOB Gameloft!!!!!!!!<br />I wish I could create a game like that!!!!!!!
B0094KT8W8|5.0|Very creative and well made, featuring many parts of the original Tron movie. Great Sound track featuring Daft Punk, and of course the dude, man (Jeff Bridges)!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I like this game very much.  It really keeps the mind active.  Would recommend to children as well as seniors.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|Family safe, and entertaining in many respects. The story was compelling and seemingly original to me, with plenty of small funny asides.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|As with all the angry bird games this is a great game for anyone.  It is challenging and fun as well as a learning tool.
B006O6EOII|4.0|It's Monster High - what can I say? My 8 year old daughter loves it. All the rage in the second grade these days. But, it's an expensive fad that won't be around in a couple of years. The legs are less appealing to the puppy than regular Barbie legs which is a plus.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is a nice game, especially for children.  It helps with hand - eye coordination as well as making them think about space and speed of shooting the bird.  It is also fun for adults.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun game. Cute, entertaining and free. Makes me want to go and watch the rest of the movies, plus it has movie clips and trailers to watch in-game.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a very nice story for all ages.  It is a good education film as well.  Would recommend it highly.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very addictive. I find myself playing it until the battery goes dead. Really fun for all ages, my five year loves it as much as me.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Love the Twilight series and this was brilliant!!! Can't wait for number 2 to be out on DVD, have seen them all but need them in my cupboard for when I want to watch them whenever!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is my favorite app. I am so addicted to this game. It is so fun and the graphics are good too, it seems as if I am playing a video game. Best free game app ever.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|Great movie, not as good as the books but still great!!! The guy in the swedish version is much more like the Mikeal I had in my head!! Still can't complain with Daniel Craig ;-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book. Kept me on my toes the entire time. I recommend this to everyone before watching the movie because it is just that good!!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I thought that the lucky one was inspiring and it was very good. I would definitely recommend it to someone. I couldn't put the book down, even when I had school the next morning I would stay up and read it. It was really good
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My daughter is autistic and will watch a different movie every week, but stay on one movie for the whole week. She loves this movie! She loves the bright colors and even laughs at a few of the parts. It's very cute and even a little educational.
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|My boys enjoy this movie, and it is a great addition to the series.  It was a little scary for them, and it is definitely not one of the movies that I am happy to sit and watch with them....
B003G4W49C|5.0|Amazing and interesting book. Tells tales of the future and past. Futuristic and mysterious. Fast paced and full of knowledge.
B00049QQHI|3.0|One major thing I was taught by my high school film teacher years ago was that when watching a film that was based off a novel, you are grading only the movie -- not the book. I agree completely. Staying true to a book's original plotline is not relevant in the reviewing process anymore. Leaving major plot points out -- or adding fluff that never existed -- are not necessarily indications of poor filmmaking. The film stands alone as its own work of art, and now it must be critiqued without acknowledging the novel.<br /><br />That being said, here we have a slightly different situation. Jim Carroll's original epithet is not a narrative, fictional story -- it's his own diary from his adolescence, his own thoughts and observations he happened to jot down during those fragile times. It doesn't really bother me that discrepancies exist between his real life accounts and film, but it does bother me that those differences are the most major in the whole theme of the story itself, and thus had the audience miss the point to it all and replaced it with a cliche one.<br /><br />Examples? Well, in reality...He didn't get clean thanks to Riker's. There was no Reggie to nurture him out of his addiction. He had a father and a sibling that provided for interesting experiences at home (but no, he has to be a lonely kid, to show why he did drugs!). Headquarters wasn't some run-down abandoned pile of bricks that anyone could crawl in and out of -- it was the apartment of some of his friends. And Jim actually did accomplish a lot of things while still battling heroin, including getting good grades, winning a scholarship to the elite Trinity and making it to the National All Star Game. Oh, and remember the scene where he barges into class in a dream and shoots everyone in the chest? That horribly cheesy adaptation was taken from an entry completely unlike it: In the journal he simply writes that sometimes he gets the urge to fire a machine gun off to his right side and directed upwardwhen he's in a certain class, NOT particularly at anybody, unless they accidentally got in the way. It's a gentler and more intriguing way of handling such a desire for a release of tension. No need to show the angst-ridden kid going Columbine to make a statement. I'm sorry, but the story in the film was like a childishly simplified version of his actual life story, and for what purpose? To be another don't-do-drugs movie with the same formulas we've seen before.<br /><br />Read the book to get a full glimpse of what I'm trying to say here, 'cause I could ramble on forever. Before you decide I'm incorrect, though, research Jim Carroll's own thoughts on the film. I've been a fan of his work since high school. Apparently, while he adored the performances and thought it was a well-made film (as do I), apparently director Scott Kalvert &#34;had no idea what my book was even about.&#34; &#34;I said, 'You're not going to go and make it all messed up and preachy, right?' and they said no, and that's exactly what they did!&#34; All Carroll's quotes.<br /><br />It became a cliche film about a cliche spiral down into drug addiction. The diary though had so much more substance, simply beCAUSE it was so real. There were gray areas, it wasn't all about drugs being so obviously bad but Jim's falling into it anyway because of angst, it was just so unexplainably fresh and original. I love Leonardo DiCaprio and this is a tremendous performance, and I was somewhat entertained by the film -- hey, there are some really good scenes. But you can't possibly read the original diary he wrote and then watch the film and decide it was an accurate portrayal not just of the facts, but of the true and original ESSENCE of the story and what he's trying to say.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read Life of Pi several years ago and recommended it over the years numerous times.  It's an amazing book that has stayed with me over the years.  I highly recommend this book.
1423140605|5.0|Rick Riordan continues the tale of the demi gods with this 3rd book in the Heroes of Olympus series.  He entertainingly brings the Greek and Roman myths to modern kids' attentions.  Adults can enjoy it along with their children 3rd grade and up (some mature younger children will enjoy it too).  Plenty of action and tales of friendship.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|The original charger that came with the ear piece was a horrible joke! The cord was three inches long! I had to buy this charge box hoping to make it less miserable. It helped but the charge cord on this thing is also a joke! Did wire prices go up or has Plantronics hired midgets to design the charging cords?

0547569653|5.0|Scott pushes himself to the limits, then beyond - that is an inspiring message whatever the endeavor; running, climbing, painting, cooking. He is grateful for his inherent ability but hones his technique carefully over time to achieve the best result because he's a perfectionist. This is the message I take the most from his book - I am not a vegan or even vegetarian, but happen to eat similar types of food with what he suggests. I am not an ultra runner, but I do run religiously. Whatever one does, there is joy to be found in the journey itself through intense devotion and perseverance. I love this book.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|This series starts strong and gets better with only a few weak spots.  The novels are a great demonstration of the notion of a \\"character-driven story\\".  And what great characters they are!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this book was fantastic! College Hoover did a fantastic job writing this book. I honestly would recommend this book to any young adult or adult. The more I read it the more intense it got and I couldn't put it down. I could read it a million more times!!!!
B004DM0UII|4.0|I'm a huge music and radio streamer. I have 4 apps I already use for varying proposes being Pandora, Grooveshark, TuneIn and 8 Tracks. This app is particularly well built and functions rather well. It's got a great UI and it's easy to understand. There's plenty of stations to listen to. Found local and international stations I'm already a fan of. All that said this app simply doesn't bring anything to the table that I don't already have the ability to do and doesn't pack enough to replace any of the apps I have. I'd recommend any of the 4 aforementioned apps before recommending this one but this is one solid app in it's own right. 4 stars!

1476715904|4.0|From Reading and Writing Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance<br /><br />At A Glance<br />This story made me laugh out loud, shout out in joy, and ball my eyes out. And I loved every minute of it. However, the insta-love was just annoying.<br /><br />The Good<br />Here's The Story...<br />Layken lost her father, was forced to move to another state, and has become the person her mother and little brother depend on. It has taken a toll on her emotions. But when she meets her next door neighbor, it feels like something has finally gone right. The first date was amazing. Their connection undeniable. But when certain things are revealed, their possible new relationship is shut down. They cannot be together no matter how much either one wants each other. Now it feels like Layken has lost someone all over again. Will she be able to get over this kind of heartbreak again?<br /><br />It Feels Like I Got Kicked in My Imaginary Testicles...<br />Okay, so I have truly cried over two books in my whole life. Slammed has now made it three. I freakin' brokedown and sobbed as I finished this book. It left me raw and sensitive. I was like a zombie the next day. But it was all totally worth it. This book blew my mind. It dealt with tough issues but it also brought a little more beauty into my life.<br /><br />Stringing Words Together...<br />Before I can get into the characters, I have to talk about the poetry. If poetry slams are really like that, then I need to go to one, or a million. I don't know how Hoover did it but the poetry and words she strung together were awe-inspiring. It made me want to be able to write something like that. Each poem/story left me a little more happy, a little more broken, and a little more amazed.<br /><br />His Lake...<br />Layken wasn't my favy character in the world but she grew on me. She had such passion and so much raw emotions that it was hard not to break a little every time she broke. Her life has been torn apart and now the possible relationship, the possible solace she could have had is dead. Why? That's a surprise you must find out yourself. At times she acted beyond her years and then she had those teenager moments when she became a brat. It was kind of interesting to watch the back and forth. Truthfully, if I was in her shoes, I would have acted the same way.<br /><br />Her Boy...<br />Will was both amazing and frustrating. He is so deep and thoughtful it was almost unreal. But the way he dealt with the situation with Layken was pretty childish sometimes. No wonder Layken was pissed off half the time. But Will always had the best intentions. His poetry was the best part for me. Every time he got on that stage to read, I was enthralled.<br /><br />The One, The Only, Eddie...<br />Eddie, Layken's best friend, was all kinds of awesome. She straight up pushed herself into Layken's life, which is what Layken needed. Eddie is the kind of person who says, \\"Okay, we are now best friends, you will be hanging out with me tomorrow, and you will be eating with me at lunch for the rest of the school year.\\" And that's all in the first two minutes you meet her. I like aggressive and confident people like that.<br /><br />MORE...<br />This is the kind of story that stays with you. I will never forget one single moment. Hoover's writing weaves a beautiful tale that takes the reader on a emotional rollercoaster. I was often surprised by the turn of events and couldn't wait to pick this book back up every time I had to put it down. Let's put it this way, when I finished Slammed, I went and read Point of Retreat right away. I just wanted MORE.<br /><br />The Bad<br />WHY, oh why did Hoover have to make this about insta-love? I think most of you will agree that insta-love has lost its flare. Layken and Will only went on one date and bam, she is balling her eyes out, going through the five stages of grief because they can't be together. Come. On. It was a little too much for me. It was like Layken's world was falling apart over ONE DATE! Get over it.<br /><br />Because of this, I also found myself not liking Layken all the time. She became a major Beotch as she went through her black pit of despair for MONTHS after knowing Will for THREE DAYS. The immature teenager came out so often, it was hard to feel bad for her when she was right. She treated her mother pretty badly too which was sad given the circumstances, which I am not revealing. It has to be a surprise.<br /><br />The Snuggly<br />Though the insta-love was a no-go for me, I still loved Layken and Will together. It's like they fit perfectly together. Their romance is very YA, we just get some kissing.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />Be ready to be chewed up and spit back out by the emotion monster. You will not leave this book without shedding at least one tear. It's like Slammed has its own soul. It is a living entity all by itself. Now that's saying something. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Quotes<br />\\"I got schooled this year by a boy.<br /><br />A boy that I'm seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably in love with.<br />And he taught me the most important thing of all...<br /><br />To put the emphasis<br />On life.\\"<br /><br />*****<br /><br />\\"Question everything.

B00884GR0W|5.0|This game is great!  It has quests,and it has a bunch of stuff to do.  It is probably going to become better than Minecraft.  Plus, on the online public chat, you can get help, since 98% of the time there is a dev team-member online.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The game is great and so as the story too. But voices do not sound convincing at all. They do not sound scared or frightened. I just started playing this game but so far the puzzles are challenging. If you are getting frustrated there are always hints to help you.

Bought the 6th and 7th seasons for something to watch over the holidays when TV is all reruns.  It started out a little odd, I thought, then as my husband and I watched episode after episode, we grew to love it and I just placed an order with Amazon yesterday to purchase the entire series.  My husband likes this so much he said he would not mind having watched the 6th season first and now we're going to start with number one as soon as we receive it!

0894803123|5.0|I love maple walnut ice cream but you cannot buy it in the store. This book has the recipe for that and much much more. So very tasty all the recipes that we have tried. Only problem is not overeating. Be careful you will love these recipes.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This was such a cute movie.  I liked how it has  singing in it. It was a really good movie I would definitely recommend it.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Fast service,Fast delivery,great movie I would recommend this movie to everyone.Great action movie! If you liked the first one you will love this one.
B000Q7B8FS|5.0|This was a very good movie I enjoyed it a lot I will be ordering the rest of the collection So if you're looking for action movie this is a good 1
B000002JNG|5.0|Manic Nirvana (1989) is a very unique sound and style for Robert Plant. It's a sound and style of music that, as he said, he invented. This music is a blend of hard rock, metal, pop, and synthesizers. It works. All of the songs rule, but my personal favorites are:<br /><br />She Said<br />Anniversary<br />Tie Dye On The Highway<br />Nirvana<br />Hurting Kind<br /><br />This is my second favorite Robert Plant solo album, ranking behind Pictures At Eleven (1982). It rocks. I highly recommend it.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|DeMille's John Corey is a hardboiled but lovable and witty cop on the trail of Captain Kidd's buried treasure. Full of adventure, misadventure, and a hurricane scene so realistic, I went to check our barometer.
0307346617|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down. I love that Brooks decided to include the stories as personal accounts. I really started to question whether something like this could happen(not zombies but a apocalyptic event and rebuilding). I am very interested to see if Brooks continues writing in this genre.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|From start to finish this movie is captivating. Good message and development of intricate plot. Would recommend for a family night.
0525958002|3.0|Before trotting off to school every morning in my youth, my morning wasn't complete without smooching my Duran Duran poster on my closet door.  So yeah, I was (am) a fan.  I, of course, read Andy's book despite never being a fan of his and thinking him rather irritating given so many stories I heard over the years.  I really felt he delivered and couldn't wait to read John's even though I was a Nick girl.  (Ahem...Mr Rhodes, I hope you're following suit)  I wish I could say that I liked the book but I didn't connect to it at all.  It was nice hearing how he and Nick met and seeing the pics but I just felt like John really held back on the things most nosey Duranies would want to hear.  Honestly, the whole \\"issues\\" with Andy sentence where he basically says there were issues but he wasn't going to get into it was a cop out and made me want to throw the book across the room.  By the end, I was ready for it to be over so I could move on to Rick Springfield's \\"Late, Late at Night\\"...now HE knows how to write a tell all!  I'll buy any book any Duran member puts out but if anyone else follows suit they have nowhere to go but up from this one.  Sigh.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the character development in this novel. Two people so thoroughly scarred by the circumstances of their lives manage to reconnect and regain the happiness they once knew, only to be caught once more in the vortex of fate. Loved this book, but unhappy with the bittersweet ending!
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Season 6 was just another example of why I keep watching Dexter! It is never disappointing and always keeps you guessing! This season was great with Colin Hanks adding to the already fabulous cast!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This was a spur of the moment buy after watching part of Spike HD's Star Wars marathon I decided I wanted to revisit this series in full HD picture and sound. What a great decision; in my opinion the picture quality is near flawless especially in episodes 4, 5 and 6 given how old the original film stock is.The sound presented in DTS-HD MA is breathtaking; one of the best audio presentations in Blu Ray ever. Episodes 4 and 5 were near perfect I didn't need to adjust my volume settings at all even during Yoda's scenes. Episode 6 was not as perfect as I noted that I had to raise the volume in certain dialog scenes but it redeems itself in the death star 2 explosion scene where you can hear the Millenial Falcon screaming towards you then the explosion of the death star 2 in the rear that then blasts itself forward.<br /><br />Now onto the movies themselves, episodes 1,2,3 are better than I recall from my initial viewing and watching them in sequence made me more involved in the story so  the flaws didn't distract as much as previously. Episodes 4,5,6 were incredibly enjoyable and converted my wife to a Star Wars fan. I had watched episode 4 on the big screen 35 yrs ago but episodes 5 and 6 were viewed on a 22 inch screen via VHS so this was a huge step up for me as I'd never re-watched any of them. Despite that I did notice some of the added scenes and other changes the fan boys rant about but I don't think it's worth subtracting one star from the review let alone 4.<br /><br />My recommendation to the fan boys is don't sell yourself short by missing out on this incredible blu ray presentation. At worst, insert the disc in the player, close your eyes to avoid Lucas' edits and treat yourself to the most enveloping audio experience on this side of the galaxy.<br /><br />Note: I watched this on my hometheater PC with Radeon 6570 video card, DTS-HD MA bitstreaming to Onkyo receiver to 7.1 surround speakers, 55 in Panasonic Plasma.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|The visuals in this series are stunning. The slow motion captures are awesome. Definitely worth owning one. The extras at the end of each session show what went into making the documentary. Those are quote intriguing as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Grabs your attention at once, great read :) can't wait for the next book in the series. I'll be sad once I'm through with all 3!
B007LB2B3K|5.0|I love this CD. I was unsure about this CD because I was only familiar with 2 songs. It is really a good CD I listen to it a couple times a day at work.
031250926X|5.0|This book is exactly the same as the classic &#34;Brown Bear&#34; book, but includes sliding flaps the children can manipulate.  I used to read the original version of &#34;Brown Bear&#34; and the kids liked it, but it sometimes lost their attention.  As soon as I introduced this book and gave them opportunities to manipulate the flaps, it became one of their favorites!
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Awesome, cannot stop watching it. Recommend it to everyone. I am watching Season 7, but I wanted to know how it all started.
0671449028|5.0|I recommend this book as a bedtime story for young children.  It is particularly fun if you act out the actions of the characters.  I often give this as a baby shower gift.
B000FC0P9E|5.0|This book is truly remarkable it is one of my favorite books for sure!! It's a must-read!! I highly recommend this
B009JBZH54|5.0|This collection is the best thing i have of batman, i would know i worship batman because not only did i get this when it became available i also got this at the cheapest price at what its at know, So first i got this at a great price than retail,and it arrived before expected. This is the best of the best into one box with bonus features, all blu-ray discs putting them at their best picture and quality!
B008HK3TXK|5.0|This is my third product I own by Timbuk2. I am growing to like this company's fun and practical designs a lot.<br /><br />The Timbuk2 Gripster Jacket for the Kindle Fire 7\\" HD is part whimsy but full functionality. The Kindle HD slides into the interior slip case and is held fast by a hook and loop (aka Velcro) seal. The fit is right on with all the ports and power buttons accessible.<br /><br />The Gripster Jacket has these fun, soft micro \\"gecko\\" fingers that took my by surprise. It allows you to prop the cover up horizontally. The gripster fingers hold fast to the surface it is propped on and won't slide. It works quite well and is fun to touch. I like this gripster design feature a lot.<br /><br />The hook and loop is used again to keep the cover securely closed when not in use. It's a little noisy to rip open. Not exactly stealthy/discreet for middle of the night reading, but not a big deal either.<br /><br />The Lola floral/mulberry design is cute. I like the mauve colors and the fun design. Mine is a bit wrinkled in the front, but it hasn't bothered me much.<br /><br />A minor detraction is that this case give the Kindle HD a more bookish form. The sleek HD design is hidden away. Other than that, it's an attractive, functional, and fun cover to own.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|My grandson was visiting so we ordered this movie. My grandson, son, and husband and I loved it. That is all.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoy playing  this game I love the mysterious of it. It pulls you into the next thing and keeps you wanting more.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|This different approach to the original story line was actually very good, my wife and I enjoyed this story and movie on a Saturday night rental from Amazon off of our kid's new WII U in HD.  The service was easy to sign up for and the Wii U was easy to order the streaming movie.  This story got us watching right off the bat and keep us glued to the TV during the development of the characters and story line.  No spoilers here so take my advise and either purchase or rent this for your own entertainment.  One note this story line might be a little much for younger viewers as I said before this is not like the original Disney Snow White and very young viewers might not understand and even scare them, so viewer age approach should be followed.
B004DM0UII|3.0|I have Tunein Radio (free version).  I like it.  When I saw this pro radio app on Amazon I thought I would give it a try.  It can't hurt, it's free today.  The ui is nice.  The stations I selected loaded quickly.  Even using 3g.  The down side so far is that none of my local stations show up.  Other reviews state the same thing.  It says local stations.  Oh well
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Coin Dozer isen't bad but you don't do much stuff all you do is.<br />1.drop coins to earn more.<br />2.earn prides.
B00479SVBU|5.0|It's fairly simple and straightforward. It depends what you want to do with it. Selecting a broadcast channel is pretty simple. The sound quality is stellar, and the GREAT and very impressive thing is that the thing is crystal clear, it doesn't pick up ANY alternator interference when broadcasting. That is a MAJOR plus. There are no ferrite modules on the AUX cable I plug in to my phone but it's still just perfect, perfect sound.<br /><br />A downside is that the FM transmitter does tend to scramble other channels while broadcasting. In general you're going to need to unplug this one before you can use the FM stereo. No huge deal.<br /><br />The MP3 player is simple, which is good and bad. It plays MP3s by folder, which just turns out to suit me perfectly; I am a very simple MP3 organizer / user. I don't use any app (iTunes or cloud storage), I just buy the MP3s, download them to folders on our network-attached storage server, and copy them to whatever device I want (phone, tablet, or play on any of the computers or media devices on the network). I do not like to fiddle with play lists or anything. I do like making compilations from various sources. I've found trouble on various Android apps that they want to play songs by artist, album, genre... which is great, unless you have a compilation. There's no way to play just folder-by-folder, and as it turns out, that's the easiest way to play files that are sorted that way. There's an inherent grouping there. I dumped some music on a standard SD card, popped it in, turned on the car, and it started playing. It also appears to bookmark the last song that was playing, so when the power comes back on, it at least picks up the same track.<br /><br />I have not exercised the remote control but there are very few buttons on the unit itself and the operation is pretty simple. You can skip one track at a time or one folder at a time. You can enable or disable shuffle. You can modify audio properties (volume, bass, treble). Again, this is very intuitive and the sound is PERFECT.<br /><br />The display is of course very simple, but sufficient for the task of playing MP3s.<br /><br />I haven't tried the USB interface yet.<br /><br />Overall, it just works great. The sound is SO much better than a cassette tape adapter and, as I mentioned, doesn't have ANY alternator whine. Ferrite beads aren't necessary.<br /><br />I also love the fact that I don't have to plug in my phone; I can just load up everything on an SD card or USB thumb drive and I'm good to go. That saves battery life on the phone without the MP3s running and the screen on during a lot of the drive time.<br /><br />Overall this does EXACTLY what it sets out to do. It's really simple and works well. If anything I'd like to see a slightly nicer display and perhaps more compact plug (or one with a detachable, wired \\"head unit\\"), as my cigarette lighter plug is tucked up pretty tightly behind the shift knob. I'm sure that's the case in many cars. I bought a separate 'extension cable' that has a more compact plug, then lets this thing just kind of sit on the center console or dangle into the passenger foot well. Just having a slightly thinner body, or perhaps more flexible joint, would let it stay plugged in even when I put the car in Park.<br /><br />It works so well, though, that it was EASILY worth the price, and I'll be glad to upgrade when they release a revised version!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is good for children.  It is safe and fun.  It has puzzles and problem solveing games whilethey can have fun earning points for new games.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Really nice design, audio plays extremely well, and a large selection to choose from.  I initially only gave this app a rating of 3*s but have changed it to 5*s as promised once I found the Christian music.  That said, coming from a Gospel background I never think of Gospel music or Christian music as a genre of \\"inspiration\\", but I'm sure that's just me.  Thanks for reading & B Blessed :-)
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Fantastic DVD set - the graphics are absolutely the finest ever made of our precious earth, and without a doubt I would highly recommend to anyone who loves nature documentaries...very relaxing to watch and fascinating facts about the earth and wildlfe populations are shared.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely love this app! Great game for passing time and skill building. Everyone I know is addicted to this game! Lots of levels to unlock and I love the sounds and colors! Still amazed that it's free!
B007L96VCY|5.0|Absolutely one the finest albums Paul McCartney ever recorded!  Would highly recommend to anyone who loves the Beatles or Paul McCartney.  I've been a huge fan of his for years, and never get tired of this music.  Very high quality!  Also my 17 year old son loves it and listens to it probably more than I do, so its a great gift for the younger generation as well!
B0091QS88K|5.0|I have a little niece that absolutely loves cooking mama, she is 2 and is already addicted to phones and tablets! She loves all Dr. Panda games because they're MADE for toddlers! It's not so easy that it's boring, it's just hard enough that they don't ask for help. It's really fun and I often find myself playing it. Even though it's the lite version it's still never-ending with cute customers.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|They just keep raising the bar on their CDs.  I love that they included a couple slower songs.  And the limited edition is worth the extra cost.
B000FC146C|5.0|Read this book years ago when it was a bestseller.  Just as enjoyable this time.  Great read. A real classic.
B0083WLKBA|4.0|Great but had a scratch on second disc that stopped the viewing of that one episode. Otherwise, I enjoyed catching upon Season 1 and 2.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|The first time I saw this it was in French at a drive in up in northern Quebec. I laughed until I was in pain. There is so much to enjoy about this movie. The scene with Aretha Franklin in the restaurant, Ray Charles, the greatest cop car chase crash of all time, the cowboy bar gig, meeting the Nun, James Brown as a preacher, Carrie Fisher trying to kill him all the time. One of the funniest must sees ever. Elwood: &#34;It's 106 miles to Chicago, we got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark... and we're wearing sunglasses. Jake: Hit it.&#34;
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked. I picked up lots of local stations. It was fun to sit outside and listen in on some unusual stations. I would say if you like to listen to the radio then this is a good buy.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|They gave me exactly what I wanted and I got my Batman on for two weeks in a row. If you liked the Nolan movies, obviously you should get it. Great deal.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use and fun to play. Im not fond of the pop-ups, but its an overall good game. Well done.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After the movie came out all my friends and family who had read the book encouraged me to read it. So I picked  it up and read it in a matter of two days. Now on to the next! I will say the movie does not do it justice  and would suggest anyone to read it.
B008NEMPTO|3.0|Abe Lincoln is a pretty solid action flick.  If you remember your history you'll enjoy a lot of the references, but don't expect camp. The movie is serious, but not meant to be taken seriously. It is, after all, a movie about Abe Lincoln killing vampires. So set your expectations accordingly. As I read other reviews here that may be the problem. Expectations. When the movie is called Abe Lincoln Vampire Slayer, I think a lot of people are going to expect something funny or way over the top. This is not that movie. It is a good action movie about killing vampires. Just sit back and enjoy.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|time for grabbing a glass of wine and sitting back and enjoying a juicy story and may need a cigarette after.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I really liked this book. As a person who has spent more than my fair share of time in hospitals I found it very relatable and true. The story was honest and great.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|The Lost City game mixes island scavenger hunting and puzzle solving with excellent results.  The scenes are beautiful, and the seasonal changes are a wonderful touch.  Although the puzzles were challenging, I did not need to use hints.  Running back and forth between locations got a bit old near the end but never really frustrating.  I wish there was more to the game, but given that I downloaded as a Free App of the Day (and price at current is $0.99), I really can't complain.  An all around good play.
0739352989|5.0|I had heard alot about this book.... I am not a book reader, so it was great to be able to listen to it.<br />It definitely has the WOW factor!!!
B003Y5H5BA|2.0|I loved the show when I was a teen and figured that was enough to get at least a little nostalgia enjoyment out of the movie. I was wrong so I write this review strictly for those considering the film as a reminiscence. Let me be clear: I wasn't offended or incensed by the profanity or other types of humor as some other low-star reviewers. I just didn't find it funny, plausible, well-written or anywhere close to interesting. If you like Jonah Hill and the current strain of raunchy humor, this movie is for you. If you are more discerning in your humor, or looking for any of the heart of the old show, I'd reccommend watching a few eps of the original on Hulu.
B009X01D9U|4.0|I have owned other cases from Marware and have always been pleased - and this case is no exception. It is a bit pricy but as they say, you get what you pay for.<br /><br />This case is solid and I'm worry-free about my Kindle getting knocked around or damaged. It snaps in tightly and isn't going anywhere. Snapping it *out* of the case eludes me - my thumbs aren't strong enough...but that doesn't concern me at all.<br /><br />Love that the hand strap is included for ease in holding the Kindle. I agree with the concerns about weight - the 8.9\\" Kindle is heavy to begin with and when you add the case it's even heavier. That said, if you are looking to use your Kindle for mostly hand-held reading, then common sense will tell you to find something lighter. Either a lighter case, or a lighter Kindle :)<br /><br />Rotating the Kindle 180 degrees is smooth after you break it in.  I spun mine around a few times to loosen it up and now it's perfect!<br /><br />Have two minor issues which cost my rating one star:<br /><br />The sleep/wake feature. Didn't work for me the first few days I had it because of the position of my Kindle in the case. With ports facing out and camera facing in, it works like a charm. But initially, I had mine spun the other way and had to give the lid a slight 'press' upon closure for it to work.  Minor, but still an annoyance that I can live with in exchange for the many reasons I love this case.<br /><br />The rotating portion of the case. There is no way to secure it. So yes, if you are holding the Kindle it can and will \\"flip open\\" if that makes sense. Simply attach a piece of Velcro to the back of the rotating portion and the case itself and this problem goes away. I'm guessing Marware will address this issue at some point.<br /><br />Two minor issues, both of which are a small price to pay for the quality and protection this case offers.<br /><br />Four Stars!!
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Came in perfect condition. All the best songs by michael jackson. Great gift for anyone. Was as good  as described on the cd
B007FXLZ9K|4.0|Shame is a disturbing and painful movie to watch for many reasons, not the least of which may be the mirror it holds up to us.  In a slow, quiet, and uninhibited style, director Steve McQueen takes us into the life of Brandon, a successful Manhattan-ite, and his ne'er do well sister, two tormented souls who might just as easily be seen as two sides of the same coin. Brandon is sterile and emotionally vacant and Sissy is a raging co-dependent whose emotions are always boiling at the surface. Both address their emotional issues with sex, Sissy hoping that every new encounter brings her the caretaker she so desperately needs and Brandon seeking only the cold anonymous release.<br /><br />The movie is intense, not so much for the sex (although it isn't going to be to everyone's taste), but rather because it forces us to look at how we deal with our own issues. It might make us feel better to delineate between \\"addicts\\" and the rest of us, but this is merely semantics. Putting a tag on someone because it distances their behavior from yours doesn't make you superior. Shame demonstrates that \\"addicts\\" (a term vastly over-used) are people who aren't handling their problems in the right way. They are not deviants or sickos or freaks, but wounded human beings - just like you. While most of us haven't sunk as low as these two, we still have our compulsions. Maybe you over-eat, are an exercise freak, or shop incessantly - one way or another we have to deal with our insecurities, traumas, and stress in some way or else we fall apart. Shame is an exploration of two people who use sex to ease their psychological pain, but what I liked about this movie was that it showed how universal our problems are. It's only in how we deal with it that we see differences, and hopefully Shame points out that disgust merely hides hypocrisy, and thus denial for those who can't see at least a little of themselves in these wounded and sympathetic characters.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Was a great gift for my husband who is hard to shop for plus we got the talking ted and a mini Ted
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I like Rick Riordan stories and I liked this story. It was slow getting started, and the narrative switch between the siblings is mildly annoying. But, I found that I looked forward to what would happen next when I got the spare hour or so to read. I assume the stories about the ancient gods and the place of magicians in ancient Egypt are more or less accurate. Going on that assumption I enjoyed the legends and myths. I would recommend this book to those who are looking for light reading.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Works good on my new kindle fire I just got yesterday, no ads or anything, and all the videos go right to my video library.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I've been very happy with this app. I collected the individual 'daily workout' apps and loved those as well. Honestly, I used the free versions or waited until the full version was the free app of the day. I actually bought this one since it's 5-in-1 and you can mix muscle group exercises easily in one session. The ONLY issue I have is that the program doesn't tell you what equipment is need (light hand weight, mat, etc) and because I rarely use the sound on my device, I'd prefer better visual cues or onscreen text instructions for proper form. Besides that, I really like this app. I actually PAID for the Exercise Ball Daily Workout on top of this one (if you knew me, that would be enough of a rave review).
B005SS2QXS|4.0|its good but some time it catch some dust but easy to clean<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-
B0051HNMTI|5.0|The Daily Workout Apps are my favorite out of any of the fitness/exercise apps. I'm actually trying to get the star ratings high enough so hopefully they make more. See you on the next app review section!
B003UYUP58|5.0|I have not finished the book but I am very happy with it.  Being a scientist myself, I find it extremely interesting and am learning much about the history of cancer that amazes me.
B007CI81IQ|4.0|This is a must-read for anyone doing development work anywhere in the world. Even though the text is a little slow at the beginning and overly anecdotal, the authors do an excellent job of reviewing the kinds of tests needed to more accurately predict the effects of well-meaning interventions for development. The book gives one hope that donors will someday realize that economic growth and poverty reduction do not have a unified theory which provides a silver bullet solution for development.  Real-world, randomized, controlled tests are needed to stop repeating the same mis-guided approaches used in the past.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Great book! Nicholas Sparks creates a masterpiece again! If you like his other books this is a must read for sure!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Flipboard may be the best news magazine app in existence, and I've looked at a lot of them. I use it all the time. Easy navigation for fast perusal of a lot of articles for a wide variety of subject areas, with an easy click to read more than the first &#34;inch&#34; of the article if so desired or skip to the next article, is exactly the same process I use when reading a printed newspaper. This app has the intuitive navigation appeal and ease of navigation that is sadly missing from other news apps. It's simply the best.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed takes you on the trail with her for a fasinating, grueling and beautiful<br />hike.  I highly recommend this read.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Could not put<br />it down. Loved it. Can't wait for the movie.<br /><br />It was much more then I anticipated. Wish their was another series.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|I haven't liked many of the recent James Horner scores, as many of them are repetitive (Horner tends to copy his own previous themes), but this soundtrack is jam-packed with good, unique cues. There's a chance he copied more than I recognized (the only copied thing I heard was one old motif from his score for &#34;Glory&#34;), but it all works together really well. I've listened to this entire album at least a dozen times.

0547884591|5.0|Undeniably the best cookbook ever written, but so much more. I frequently had to stop reading to get up and walk around, almost in a fantasy state about the possibilities and doorways this book opened up for me. Easy to read, fun, highly intelligent yet remarkably accessible. Cultured and classy, yet full of innuendo and well mannered sex jokes. One of those books which can be recommended to friends 5-10 years later and cited as a keystone for success, both and cooking and other pursuits. Thought to myself while reading, \\"man, this is one dude who got this whole living business right.\\"
B008PCVGKI|5.0|Excellent appraisal of the rorts the drug companies commit and a decent appraisal of the gullibility of the public believing that any ill can be resolved by any pill.<br />Most medicines are of no use to most people, and this message is a very difficult one to promote. Ben Goldacre writes a very readable appraisal of market manipulation by big pharma, and the belief of the public in the need for something to swallow.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|another great Pixar movie that while it is a lovely female themed lesson its value is for both sexes --- a fun movie with great voice acting by major hollywood actors.  typical flawless Pixar animation and a nice story with a genuinely good lesson for kids and adults.  entertaining and funny as well.  Not the absolutel best pixar movie for adults but it was certainly fun and worth the watch and putting in ones collection if you our you child wanted a permanent copy of it.  The extras are fun but not really that much  but you do have a physical DVD so there you go.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|Picked this up with the original Perplexus puzzle for Christmas gifts for my nieces aged 10-16.  It intrigued everyone at the holiday gatherings from the youngest to oldest.  Challenging and a bit frustrating for the youngest, but for the tweens to adults it was a good bit of fun trying to accomplish the mazes.  Would recommend having played with the Perplexus version one before attempting this more challenging game.  Quality=excellent and shipping/delivery was as promised.

B008JFC6F0|5.0|Psychedelia has had a quiet revival over the past several years.  Bands interested in pushing at the limits of rock and roll's sound have found an ally in a genre that aimed to do just that nearly fifty years ago.  The Black Angels, The Wooden Shjips, and Thee Oh Sees, among others, have mussed up the psychedelic formula by introducing droned out songs or encrusting their music with gravel.  Tame Impala likewise have their own take on the genre that proves that psychedelia still has plenty of life in it after all these years.<br /><br />Where much of modern day psychedelia is paired with a love for a hardscrabble garage rock edge, Tame Impala makes full use of the studio.  Opening track, \\"Be Above It,\\" filters the phrase \\"I gotta be above it\\" and its accompanying verses through various means of  electronic transformations while fireworks of noise occasionally go off.  All of these production pyrotechnics could easily tip the album into the darker waters of ELO's discography.  But what really keeps the album on a steady keel is the fact that at the center of each song is an immediately catchy bass line or keyboard melody.  While chief architect, Kevin Parker, managed almost all of the album's instruments, there's a wonderful interplay between keyboards, guitars, and drums that sounds like the work of a full band.  The percussion in particular makes certain that every track bounces along from beginning to end.<br /><br />But Parker doesn't get all of the credit.  The album was produced by none other than Dave Fridmann, one of the closest things to a household name when it comes to rock and roll music producers.  Best known for his work with Mercury Rev and Flaming Lips, Fridmann is a natural fit for Parker's psychedelic ambitions.  I must admit that I've always had a mixed relationship with Fridmann's production.  While I've appreciated his quest to open up a band's sound, his tendency to compress each album to the hilt not only causes ear fatigue but also flattens the sound of the artist.  When there's no difference in the levels between vocals and drums, then the music starts to lack any depth.  Luckily, the problem of compression is mostly absent from Lonerism (at least by the standards of today's music).  Perhaps Fridmann has learned his lesson or perhaps he is reacting to the fact that everyone's compressing their music these days.  Regardless, Lonerism is easily one of the best production jobs of his career.<br /><br />Thanks to Fridmann's influence and Parker's talents, Lonerism makes a unique mark on the music landscape.  While Fridmann's production wraps up each song in a crystalline cocoon, Parker's writing skills ensure that, at its center, each song is worth listening to.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great book and if your wanting to spice things up in the bedroom read chapters of this book....my husband is encouraging me to read the rest of the trilogy.  He had a great week of sex, the week I read this book.

B008HK3XOU|5.0|This fits my Kindle Fire HD perfectly and I can charge it while it is in the case. Some people complained it could not be charged while in the case...they must have it upside down! Some also complained it does not fit their Kindle...they must have the wrong model for this case because mine fits PERFECT. Looks classy and well made for the price. Works well as a stand for hand free reading as well. I chose standard shipping and it was sent out right away. Arrived very fast.

B0084IG8TM|2.0|I watched this on a free preview of EPIX, Im glad i didnt buy it, But then again i never wouldve bought it to begin with. I really only watched it because i liked Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone and X-Men: First Class the film contains Horrible special effects(watch when Jennifer and Josh are lead on the platform with the audience cheering about 30 minutes in), RIDICULOUS hairstyles, i mean really, Did Stanley Tucci have to have blue hair? And what about Elizabeth Banks? Stupid. When the \\"tributes\\" are trying to attack Jennifer while shes in the tree, why weren't they worried about killing each other instead of her? Several other dumb moments like that. Woody Harrellson  and Donald Sutherland are in this but they basically have bit roles and don't really add anything. All in all this was 2 and a half hours of my life i wished i couldve spent better. Pretty boring, not worthy of the hype at all.

B0085RQLXK|5.0|So, yes....I am one of those Aerosmith Fans that grew up in Cape Cod, spent lots of time in Marshfield and lived through my teens on Get your Wings, Toys, Rocks, Draw the line...and all the rest....the easily matched Led Zeppelin and the British Invasion.<br />Aerosmith are running behind the Cryin and Crazy Dream....the Tyler Ballad system that keeps pouring sand in the gears. Instead of letting Brad Whitford and Joe Perry write more Blues Oriented Hard Rock Songs, ....the Boss is at the wheel and he is all about \\"love\\" and he is forgetting the core.... These are really sad developments since Permanent Vacation ...but...we have to realize that there will never be another \\"Back in the Saddle\\",  another \\"Rats in the Cellar\\"...<br /><br />Anyway....Music from another Dimension, I bought the double LP and the CD along with the DVD and additional Tracks...I bought the whole load. When I got home I was really disappointed and hurt...what is going on??? And then it hit me.<br /><br />Aerosmith are NOT a double Album Band, and so from the 15 Tracks I decided to make a 9 Track ALBUM. All these stupid Ballads are a waste of time and a waste of money. I sat down, cut the Opening so that LUVXXX starts without Intro.<br /><br />Then I mixed my own Dimension like this:<br />Street Jesus,  Out go the Lights,  LuvXXX,  Lover A lot, Something,  Oh Yeah,  Beautiful,  Legendary Child, Freedom Fighter and then added as a last song Up on a Mountain.<br /><br />I sent the material to a friend and had him press  a 180gram Vinyl LP and when I got it back I really threw away all the material I had bought except for the DVD and I had ONE RECORD left.<br />I printed an Album Cover that says: Perry, Kramer, Hamilton and Whitfords Way.<br /><br />Turning up the stereo and sitting down with a beer I decided to give it another chance and this Album blew me away!!!!!! Unbelievable riffs. Good Solo work, great drumming, Bass pounding, Tyler in best form.<br />The Album contains some of the hardestlicks I have ever heard them play, there are real jewels once you understand that Aerosmith also kept developing musically.<br />The Ballads are the songs that kill the Rock Spirit, because Ballads are not written like Dream On anymore, they are generic Pop and I despise them.<br />If Aerosmith would release a Ballad free record they would boost their sales.<br />I love the new Album I have created with the Songs that Aerosmith provided me with. Raunchy, nasty excellent Hard Rock at its best.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|This is not some Cheap Plastic. This is quaility Metal and it shows. Great durability and if you read the previous review about putting a piece of cardboard behind this item before putting on your cloths, listen to that reviewer! It works great and I bought the rest of the set. Very happy with this item. The only complaint is the box does not show the Division name clearly since it is written light, but who cares, its the box. The Product is great!

B0094WK9GU|5.0|Great stuff from Swedish House Mafia. This was my first album purchase and I love practically every song on it. This DJ music is great and I am sad to see this will be their last tour. :-(  If you get a chance, watch the video of their song Don't You Worry Child. Great Stuff! I am getting the rest of their albums because I love this kind of music.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Having kids means sometimes having to watch things suitable for them. The Ice Age movies have actually (suprisingly) been movies that I actually enjoy as an adult viewer. I have never been disappointed with any of the Ice Age movies. This edition still has the wonderful interplay of the characters, Manny, Syd, and Diego, in their unusual &#34;family&#34;. A couple of new characters are added for this episode: Syd's granny, a pirate baboon, and a love interest for Diego. The humor is still wonderful and the message is still clear: Families come in all shapes and sizes (and individual members have their own strengths and weaknesses) and there is nothing more important than the family unit.
B0095EMOTM|5.0|I have say, I LOVE this album. Great stuff. I have been getting into DJ remixes and songs a lot and love it. If you like this kind of music, I would recommend you buy it. The first song Titanium is awesome along with the rest of the 22 track CD. If you like DJ Dance remix music, get this album.

B0001VV1GK|3.0|Despite some of the red edging being splintered as a result of poor quality control rather than damage in shipping (wood used for these is a bit flimsy) the toy was a huge success with my 2 year old.

1401233791|3.0|Knightfall was the Batman crossover of 1993, with a simple premise: New villain Bane breaks all of Batman's enemies out of Arkham Asylum in an effort to bring Batman to his breaking point.  The first half of this collection is a well-paced action story, with Batman stretched to his limits running the gauntlet of villains like Amygdala, Firefly, Poison Ivy, and Mr. Zsasz.  When he's beyond exhausted, Bane finally engineers a confrontation, and for the entirety of an issue, beats Batman to a pulp and (SPOILER ALERT for a 20-year old story that made headlines back in the day) breaks Batman's back.  New character Jean Paul Valley, aka Azrael, assumes the mantle of Batman, with a decidely darker sensibility than Bruce Wayne (didn't think that was possible, did you?) and eventually takes on Bane himself.  This is where the story begins to go off the rails (but more on that in Volume 2.)<br /><br /> The crossover was mostly confined to issues of Batman and Detective Comics, and many of the creators involved are longtime Batman veterans. Chuck Dixon and Doug Moench, usually reliable writers, keep things tightly plotted and briskly paced, and a massive team of artists including Graham Nolan and Jim Aparo give Knightfall the epic feel it deserves.  Fans will appreciate the brief appearances in this volume by Oracle, the Huntress, and Anarky, as well as a Joker/Scarecrow team-up and fresh takes on the Ventriloquist and the Riddler.  There's a lot to like in this story.  However, once Azrael becomes Batman. . . The character is basically a checklist of early 90s antihero character traits, complete with a bad attitude, an armored costume full of pouches, and cringeworthy witty banter.  (When Bane says that Gotham City is in his pocket, Azrael retorts with \\"Prepare to get mugged!\\") When Azrael first appears in his new armored Batman costume, FIVE WHOLE PAGES are spent on him brooding on a rooftop, soliloquizing about the darkness of the city and in his own soul.  This was anotherstaple of early 90s comics: heroes \\"brooding on cathedral rooftops in the rain\\".  This scene is without rain at first - until the rain starts and the new Batman notes \\"Rain.  Rain makes it perfect.  The flood from heaven.  Beginning anew, and now for real.\\"<br /><br /> In terms of completeness, this collection does a good job.  The entire Knightfall storyline is collected here in one volume, whereas the earlier editions spread the story across two collections.  Also included is the rare oneshot, Vengeance of Bane, which introduced the character and told his origin story.  Missing are the issues of Batman that led into the Knightfall story; while not essential, these issues built up to the story and would help to clarify who Azrael is and some allusions made during the Knightfall story.  Since Knightfall is a major story in the Batman's history, it could be considered an essential read.  It's just hard to determine whether DC Comics wanted readers to take Azrael seriously or see him as a parody of the conventions of early 90s comics.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Interesting characters, easy reading.  Everyone has someone memorable from high school that this novel will bring to mind.  Some parts were not very realistic, who gets someone stoned that is having emotional problems!
B009AMANBA|5.0|WONDERFUL MOVIE, GO SEE IT AND OWN IT WHEN IT COMES ON DVD!!! I HAVE SEEN IT TWICE AND WILL SEE IT AGAIN, AND AM READING TEAM OF RIVALS. Since my review, I have gone to see this movie a third time! I cannot fathom how anyone could rate this movie with one, two, or a three star. People, were you gone to get popcorn and to the restroom while this was being shown? did you see something else? This film is OUTSTANDING!!! GO TO SEE IT ON THE BIG SCREEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Wholly cow people. You don't have to write a book on a review. You either like it or not. You're not spending your entire paycheck to watch it.<br />It's a good movie, for me.

Suffice it to say this album will be in heavy rotation if no other reason that it make me wanna get up and GO daddy-o.
6305428425|5.0|An easy, funny story turned hilarious and a classic because of the cast choices. Mira Sorvino, Lisa Kudrow and Jeanine Garofalo are killer in this movie. I laugh till I peed. Then watched it again. And you can't beat the price!!

B008HT4FUW|5.0|I have watched Masterpiece and PBS for many years so that I can enjoy the British productions that many years ago were not easily availble in the US or at least not in my area. I believe the popularity of Downtown Abbey is partially due to a desire to return to a more elegant or civilized way of life. By this I mean a return to manners in treatment of others.  It shows that it is possible to express disapproval without rudeness as Maggie Smith's character does so wonderfully.
B009329ZF2|3.0|when i saw the movie ad's on tv was was like this will be a total bomb.<br />my cable company gave me a ppv movie credit, and the original movie i wanted to see they were having issues with it so could not get it.<br />i was like what the heck i will get this and cringed as i hit the buy button on my remote.<br />as soon as i hit it i was like what did i just do.<br />well it took me a few hours to get up the courage to watch it.<br />it started off slow and picked up a little more speed later on, but not much more.<br />all the way through it i was waiting for them to say b4, and later on they did come close to it.<br />this is a ok movie not as bad as i thought it would had been.<br />if i had gone to the movies and spent $15 on a ticket plus popcorn and stuff i would had been po'd.<br />i came in to the movie with very low expectations and although it didn't hit it, it wasn't great.<br />some of the dialog and cursing in the movie made me wonder why did they put that there.<br />the character development wasnt there either.
B006O2QNOU|4.0|I really enjoy mature intelligently written films; a rarity these days.<br /><br />Well acted and directed, this film gives an inside look at the mindset of investment bankers on the eve of the MBS (Mortgage Backed Securities) market collapse.

B008VO3PA4|5.0|This is not the typical poetry ascribed to animals.  Not cutesy and no baby talk.  Instead, it's the standard attitude of cats.  One of my favorites is about a cat whose owner is screaming.  The cat asks why and what can be done to stop the screaming.  A change in size, a change in color, a change in location.  Yes, it's a dead mouse and the cat only wishes that the owner would stop screaming and tell the cat how to fix the situation.<br /><br />  My friends know I have a bunch of cats and you'd be amazed how many cat gifts I get:  pot holders, calendars, cute little pictures or statues of Victorian cats.  Most of this ends up in a drawer or closet.  This book sits on the coffee table.  It's hysterically funny.  And very catlike.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|This movie was an embarassment for both these fine actors.  The one good thing I can say about this movie is that there was no violence in it.

B005LFQRTC|5.0|I grewup watching this TV series and always loved it. I wanted to add this to my collection of TV series.
0375850864|4.0|\\"When You Reach Me\\" makes for a quick afternoon read, just a lovely and fun book. Juvenile fiction sometimes grabs me, especially when it relates to one of my favorite books of all, \\"A Wrinkle in Time.\\" This book from Rebecca Stead is definitely worth picking up. The ending more or less telegraphs itself to the older reader by the midway point, but it's a great book for a child or grandchild. I would have loved this book as a kid.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the most fun game I have ever played. I love it. But it freezes a lot. And the characters are very expensive.
0670023329|5.0|I finished this book about three months ago, and it still haunts me. The nonfiction \\"Escape from Camp 14,\\" the story of a young man who was able to escape the North Korean prison camp in which he was born 23 years earlier. This is a heartbreaking book of a boy who, at the age of 13, reported his mother and brother to authorities for plotting the brother's escape, then having to reconcile this act after seeing them executed (and being tortured himself for possibly being complicit). This is an important book that should be read by anyone with a mind to ridding the world of tyranny. A powerful, powerful book.
B003U80I5G|4.0|THIS VERSION IS OVER 3 MINUTES SHORT.My wife is an avid Jane Eyre fan. She kept saying something was missing.Just happen to pick up another copy real cheap for our bedroom, and sure enough the missing scene was there--when Rochester's ward and Jane Eyre enter the library to get the present for the young girl.
0061969664|4.0|Bernard Cornwell's rather excellent 'Saxon Chronicles' continues to be excellent with \\"Death of Kings,\\" the sixth installment of that series. The series centers around Uhtred, a young Saxon boy in 9th century England who is kidnapped and raised by Danes; he returns to England and swears fealty to Alfred the Great. In this book, King Alfred is on his deathbed, and everyone around him is aware that, with his death, comes many people (mostly Danes) who will try to carve England up into chunks and rule them individually. The book is often humorous, sometimes very violent, but always entertaining. Historical fiction for a period that is not often written about.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|There's not a whole lot to say. I didn't like this book at all. I would compare my experience in reading it to watching paint dry.
B00877R85I|5.0|'The Hunger Games' by Suzanne Collins. Are you kidding me? The Hunger Games? This book blew me away. Not the perfect book, but the perfect example of a book that makes you flip through each page with an ever-increasing velocity. Collins speaks through her characters eloquently, and allows her narrator the right amount of imperfections to make us want to throttle her and hug her. It's a heck of an accomplishment. I look forward to grabbing the next two books in the series.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I need more please, this trilogy has me going in circles. I love them all I have read them all twice well I least the first one and I'm getting ready to start part two again right now. Please write more to add to the collection. Maybe start how you finish this one with Christian's perspective. Love it.
1451627297|5.0|Just finished Stephen King's massive \\"11/22/63\\". What a great book; it's not the blood and gore King you may be used to reading (or, if that's not your thing, reading about). It is layered with a rich subplot of a love story, and is nothing short of amazing. The best thing I've read by him since \\"The Stand.\\" Kind of a cross between a detective novel and the movie \\"Somewhere in Time.\\"<br /><br />It's not a perfect book by any stretch; King could easily have whittled 200 pages out of this by removing a lot of the dialogue between Lee Harvey Oswald and his presumed conspirators; there are details in the book that I felt were included to show us, in a smarmy way, just how much research was done for the book. Regardless, I can only hope to find one more book this year that I enjoyed as much as this one.<br /><br />If it were a movie, I'd give it five out of five stars.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Bit of everything in this one.  So hard to put down that I read till my eyes got sore.  (Could have been the few tears I shed...)
B0095GSE9E|3.0|'Mockingjay= - the third and last of the Hunger Games books. This one is almost as good as its two predecessors, but I was a little disappointed in one aspect (MINI-SPOILER ALERT). Collins decided in the last 30 pages to kill off a major character that supposedly has substantial influence on Katniss's motivations and actions through the rest of the last chapter. I think the killing was unnecessary to the plot, as Katniss was moving in the direction she chose regardless. Maybe I'm wrong; I'm not the sort of reader who gets offended or outraged when a favorite character dies - after all, these are characters, not real people. But to try to manipulate readers in this manner seems a little disingenuous. Regardless, it's a roller coaster of a book, and well worth reading.
B004EBT6HE|5.0|Great book. One of the best I've read from Follet. You won't be able to put it down until it's over.
0062201522|5.0|Rolling Stone called this a 'self-laceration' in their favorable review.  Brilliant description.<br /><br />I just finished this excellent autobiography, \\"Who I Am\\". Magnificent. Townshend comes off as pompous at times, and at other times, self-deprecating and downright self-loathing. He doesn't appear to have had any help from a ghost-writer - it took him 16 years to write, during which time many relationships and friends (and one bandmate) succumbed to Father Time. And he does not shy away from his arrest on charges of downloading child pornography (offering a convincing explanation that I thought would not have gripped me as it had).  This book is well worth scouting out and grabbing, particularly if you are a fan of his music.  It really was difficult to put down.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Loved it. I can't wait for the movie to come out. Would have never thought it would end that way
B000HEVZ8K|5.0|This is one of the very best movies John Wayne ever starred in. Its an excellent Movie with an excellent Theme!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good read, charming, and fun. Nice to escape into a romantic story where somebody works for a relationship, doesn't just fall into a love of a lifetime.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I read the first and second books of The Hunger Games and loved them. This book was very disappointing, and the end was very open. At some parts I wanted to throw my book down and never pick it up. But, I always finish books that I start. This book was violent, gory, and made the apocalypse look like a joke. I f I had the choice to read it again I wouldn't. Some parts were confusing. Like when a major person died, Suzanne killed them off with very little emotion. This book ruined my view on the Hunger Games.
0393327345|5.0|The book is excellent, and so is the movie -- but the movie leaves out the details which give you insight into his mind. The movie is also different; there are parts that are completely changed from the book.<br /><br />I watched the move on blu-ray after reading the book just recently. Worth it even if you already saw it a while ago like me.<br /><br />The book isn't long either, only about two hundred pages, and is an easy read.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|We love Taylor Swift. Not only is she a great singer/songwriter but a great role model for young girls. Red is no exception to that rule. Love it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Though \\"The Last Man\\" does some of what many other action novels are doing these days -- rewriting the war in Afghanistan in terms that satisfy readers' desires in ways real-word news does not -- Flynn fleshes out the plot with themes familiar to his readers: honor and principle above politics and self-interest; personal bravery in contrast with mere authority; concrete experience and evidence in contrast to public posturing. Though Flynn's characters fall into by-now familiar categories, his gift for empathy and detail makes us see them as real, and not just as \\"types.\\" Flynn's plotting is engaging and he provides plenty of exciting incidents, twists, turns, and new developments as we go. (Contrast this with DeMille's \\"The Panther\\" in which little happens as we march forward, page by page, to a predictable end.) Flynn's cast of characters includes many familiar faces, but he allows them to grow and change, and never assumes that the reader will \\"get\\" these characters from reading earlier books. There are some lapses here and there -- some interesting new characters who never really feature as they could/should -- but let's not quibble. This is an exciting book that delivers on its premises, and Flynn's fans should be pleased with it. I was.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this is way better then regular angry birds and angry birds star wars is the best game ever because it has cool levels in the tattooine and the death star and the hoth and the jedi and the bonus levels and it has new powers
B005LAIH2W|4.0|\\"John Carter\\" is limited not by what's in the movie, but what isn't. There's a lot to like here, as so many reviews point out. I'm a lifelong reader of Burroughs, and somewhat to my surprise, I instantly liked many of the ways in which the film fills out what can be pretty thin writing in the original novel. But this is only two-thirds of a movie, and really falls short in some important respects. John Carter himself needed and deserved much more depth as a character in order to move from page to screen franchise. Robert Downey's Sherlock Holmes shows how a novelized character can be developed into a film presence; John Carter makes it partway there, but the main character just isn't compelling. Ditto Deja Thoris, who ends up being personable and appealing, and well acted, but never the ultra-female force that she could have been. Did Disney require that she be kept under wraps (literally: clad in metal) when the modern screen calls for her to be unleashed? And the director never solved the problem of alien Tars Tarkas, who needs to come across as a strong individual but who in the film ends up as one of a beautifully-executed but relatively characterless army of Tharks. The result of these unrealized needs is a movie that never comes entirely to life, and which rarely excites or thrills, even though so much of what has been accomplished is impressive and cool. Ultimately, it's a fantasy that captures our eyes but not our minds, hearts, or belief.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Since I was an Earth Science teacher, I love to have all the factors possible contributing to the weather locally.  This app provides it right at your fingertips so you can review as much or as little information as preferred at the time.
B000MCIBB6|4.0|Though not on the same level as the first two albums, \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" (1968) remains solid Doors all the way. Along with the chart-topping \\"Hello, I Love You\\" are essential tracks such as \\"Not to Touch the Earth,\\" \\"Summer's Almost Gone,\\" \\"Yes, the River Knows\\" and the explosive \\"Five to One.\\" More relaxed in tone, but no dead spots - certainly superior to \\"The Soft Parade.\\" The title track would make its belated debut on \\"Morrison Hotel.\\"
B009GIPDQS|4.0|I like this book. It's easy to read, not to involved.You can put it down, pick it up a couple days latter & not need to re-read to catch up where you were at. Perhaps not vintage John Grisham but still very much in his style.<br />I've read this a couple of times now & would totally recommend it to anyone from their mid teens on who wants a lighter Grisham.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|my grandchildren went ballistic. thought it was there greatest gift ever.couldn't eat breakfast fast enoughto get to the game.great family fun.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|TOO MUCH VIOLENCE. ESPECIALLY DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON. SORRY I EVEN RENTED THIS MOVIE.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND TEENS.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Very cool Internet radio player. Great layout and controls. But the one odd thing is there is no way to exit or close the app. You need to go into the application manager in sdttings to stop the app.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Plenty of action in this one (ok, I had one wild dream after watching this).  Not your typically shoot 'em up.  One of Bruce Willis's more thought-provoking films.
0763655465|5.0|Chris Haughton is a favored author in our household.  My 2.5 year old son loves Little Owl Lost so I was interested to read Oh No, George! to him.  He loves it.  It took a couple of reads for him to figure out what's going on in the book (which is not a bad thing at all).  Once he did though, he loved to predict what will happen next.  We've read this book so much that now my son is re-enacting the book with his stuffed animals, including a stuffed dog whose name has been changed from \\"doggie\\" to \\"George\\".  I also love that my son learned some new vocabulary, including, lovely and ruined.  Finally, the simple illustrations manage to convey much meaning and emotion.  Can't wait to see what's up next for Chris Haughton.
0553582038|5.0|My boyfriend Hayden LOVED this song &#34;A Feast for Crows&#34;. He loves the author George R.R Martin. He's making me want to read his books.
B004DM0UII|2.0|Decent enough interface to Nullsoft's Shoutcast service, but it offers nothing I don't I already get from Nullsoft's WinAmp (which also plays my MP3 files).  I use Shoutcast everyday on my Sony Dash and love it.  Don't be fooled by the app's description which claims \\"local station\\" and \\"50,000 radio stations\\".  These are Shoutcast internet streams, not all are associated with radio stations, and good luck finding one that is local.<br /><br />Installed and tried to stream audio, got \\"ANDROID MEDIA FAILURE: WHAT:-38 EXTRA:0\\" errors.  Played with settings, had to change Stream Engine setting to FFMpeg to get it to work.
B006AN78XS|5.0|I don't buy movies, but I bought this one.  An instant classic, with a thousand memorable lines, and not enough Hemingway and just enough of everyone else.  Five stars!
B00006I53S|1.0|There is a fault with the auto focus mechanism in the lens causing it to move in a very slow and jerky motion.  I will have find someone to service the lens after finding out whether it is worth the trouble and cost.  The lens can only be operated using the manual focus.  I can't help feeling that the lens was sent to me, as a purchaser out of the US, being seen as a chance to get rid of a faulty item with no come back.  It is not worth sending it back and nothing else I can do.  I know buyer beware and all that stuff, but I am still very disappointed with this transaction.
B008WK30XO|5.0|What a great film.  I understand that a lot of people didn't &#34;get it&#34;, but if you didn't think that Tom Hardy deserved every award in the book for this performance, then you've probably had too much white lightning.
B0086700CM|4.0|U like risk taking games if your device is fully charged there will be np but if not there will be glitches 4 example when u tilt to move it will stay still but works great on kindle fire
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This story is an unexpected mix of hilarity, science, and life threatening situations. I've never cheered so hard for a fictional character. Read it.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is entertaining for both myself & my 11yr. old son so I'm thrilled. Some of the levels are surprisingly pretty challenging & make you think. An awesome find :)
B001I45UFC|4.0|I read this out loud to my kids (5, 4 & 1) and they enjoyed it.  The descriptive sections often lost them but they seemed to understand the overal story and definitely fell in love with the characters.<br /><br />We then followed it up with the movie from Disney.  Also good, but they portrayed Susan very poorly compared with how she was in the book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|G5 has done it again! Here is another great adventure game that is just outstandingly! The graphics and music continue to improve with every game , and the story is completely engaging and original.<br /> I am absolutely obsessed with all of the G5 adventure/detective games and have played them all several times. Please keep making these games (and quickly because I just can't wait to play them!) and keep up the great work.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|I'm missing Season Six (Part 1) Disc 2!<br /><br />Why? This should not happen!<br /><br />Please send.  I'm not happy about this.
1616960922|5.0|I really like Brandon Sanderson let that color this review.<br />The book is short and that actually helps the author tell the story. I don't want to tell you why the story is so good because that would reveal too much about the actually story. I guess you'll just have to trust me that if you like Fantasy, Characters vs. action, and interesting uses of magic that Sanderson specializes in then you will probably enjoy this story.
1469984202|5.0|I had just about given up on the genre of sci fi after reading so many disappointing books.  I randomly ordered this book and, much to my surprise, once I opened it, I could not put it down.  This author has restored my faith in the future of sci fi and I would not hesitate to purchase another book.  Hurray for someone who actually knows how to spin a tale and create a believable world.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Thought provoking and a fun flick. It dragged a little at times, or else I would have given it 5 stars.
030758836X|5.0|I was unsure after reading some reviews about how good this book would be. It was amazing! I read it in less than a week. I could not put it down. Twice, it kept me up until 3am. MUST BUY
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! it is great for critical thinkers and its SO MUCH FUN! I cant stop playing it! I even got my mom hooked;)
B0067EKY7M|5.0|This is a stunning movie; absolutely fabulous! The photography is fantastic in the use of focal changes to enhance scenes. The script includes drama and surprise comedy. The entire performance is cast with perfection. I loved the story; loved the scenery; loved the entire visual and audio experience.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|This is typical Clancy: a slow beginning, lots of lose threads and must be developed. Then it starts to pick up speed to a breathtaking finale. The plots is modern with cyber space, computer virus, worms, ect playing a part. I recommend this book.
B007EDYN36|3.0|I love KISS and have since my friend's older brother gave me Destroyer on vinyl in 5 th grade. Peter's tale is a sad one created mostly by his own design. In this book he comes across as a victim instead of a willing, responsible participant.
B001NEK2GE|2.0|I really tried to like this unit, but it just doesn't cut it for me...<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easily programmable buttons<br />Integrated well with game program<br /><br />Cons:<br />Ackwards<br />Big<br />Some buttons hard to get to<br />Left handed only<br />Buttons don't feel right, feel mushy
B005HNMPBM|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone looking to see the rewards of hard work and persistence. It shows what good training can do and wise leadership.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love this game so far. G5 games are always good.  Its hard enough to be challenging without making it so hard you constantly need hints. great job!
B001FVD65O|5.0|A good movie!<br />Lo t or action !<br /> Another great Die Hard!<br /> I really enjoy a real a good  movie!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This is a hard review to write.  On one hand, I loved the story, I loved the characters, Abby and Travis.  Travis is the typical bad boy, tamed by the 'good girl' with mysterious past.  The story was easy to read, and it went quick.  So that's more of a 5-star.<br /><br />Some of the plot gets a 3-star.  Maybe not even that.  Being a bit older than the usual audience, I did have problems with the relationship.  First, Travis seriously beating up anyone that even looked at Abby.  Really?  Second, I really see these two divorced in maybe a year.  Or less.  I can't see their relationship surviving.  And that's what kept going through my mind!  Travis was way too obsessed with Abby, and Abby sometimes just didn't seem to give a crap.  So there were parts of the story that got me a 3-star.<br /><br />Overall, this was a solid 4, if you can get past some of the irritating pieces.  Still worth a read!
B004DM0UII|4.0|The interface is nicely designed, way better than most radio apps. There is no local stations, however, you can manually add them by finding the stream URL at The Stream Center and adding it under the favorites section by clicking add URL. Other than that it is a great app.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|THIS GAME IS A LOT LIKE BEJEWELED BUT BETTER.  YOU CAN PLAY FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES OR FOR HOURS AND IT IS ALWAYS DELIGHTFUL.  DOWNLOAD....AND ENJOY!!!!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|they just keep getting better and better, and this is the best yet. This family movie is the awesome.<br /><br />Manny learns what it means to be a father to a teenaged daughter. He and the boys get stranded and they have to make their way back to Ellie and Peaches.<br /><br />A good movie for kids
B009HELT3C|4.0|the acting was passable but the special effects were great...very worth watching<br />good movie for science fiction advocates and probanbly younger people
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love all the stuff you can find- and then reorganize your own way! just wish it were easier on all platforms to move pins around &amp; edit boards.
B009VB998I|4.0|As usual , Disney hit a gold mine...this was a delightful wondrous little adventure<br />well written and the animation was superb...Loved It
B0023SDPS6|5.0|A great read. Unique, quirky central character( the Sheriff) combined with a different story line and interesting humor make this one fun book! A new kind of hero that thankfully isn't infallible, superhuman, or annoyingly perfect.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The book was great from the very beginnig to the end<br />David Baldacci has become my new favorite author...I have read nearly all his novels<br />and he is also real versital , can write well in differant Genres
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This DVD set was purchased as a Christmas gift. My niece loves this series and wanted a set so she can watch it whenever she wants to.
B0020M99LC|4.0|The storyline is real good and Daniel Craig does a good job as Bond<br />the action is good but some needs to be toned down<br />A very worth watching movie
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|This film had some unique and original ideas, however, it felt like the writers were trying so hard make the ending an unexpected twist that they forgot to make sure it made sense. Much of the action happened so fast that there wasn't enough time to make the plot fit to the action. The first half of the film was interesting and neat the second half felt like the plot was abandoned to make room for action sequences and child murder.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br />The end of the movie happens abruptly, and, stupidly. JGL kills himself to make sure his loop cannot kill the boy and complete the cycle. There is really no reason why he couldn't have waited and explained to Willis why he cannot kill the boy. The way the timeline works, if JGL killed himself at any point after Willis attempted to kill the child Willis' actions would have ceased to exist and the child would never have died.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|I enjoyed this movie from start to end..The acing was fairly good the plot was done<br />well and it moved along at a good pace...really liked movie
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|Definitely a different perspective of a holocaust survivor . No living in holes or walls , no attics or barns but was not without the sense of terror and dread that these Jews had to live with . Her ordeal was almost worse because of the fact she was hiding in the open .
B009JBZH54|5.0|Christopher Nolan has done an amazing job at making one of the best trilogies in the superhero genre as well as one of the best trilogies in film period!  Thank you for restoring the Batman movies to what they should have been in the first place.  The only other Batman film worth mentioning outside these so far was Tim Burton's &#34;Batman&#34;.  After that they were a train wreck until Christopher Nolan took over.  Great Collection.  Nice case.
B00005QW5X|5.0|This movie is so…wonderful. I saw it years ago and gave it to my brother in law and now he and his girlfriend are hooked. She is going as Hedwig for halloween.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I liked to know what words mean I have to know what words mean all the time all smart people know
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|well worth the paid version. this game is completely addictive and beautifully rendered.  short but similar in theme to various puzzle games....
B007HACDLK|5.0|Every one of his works is excellent. This one as usual was hard to lay down. There is never a boring section. The content is suspenceful and the ending is surprising. He does not get lazy and it appears he tries to make the next one better, He creates very interesting charactors.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Lots of fun. Options to listen as if in a noisy theater or just hear the movie, for a change:)<br />Other features too. Worth the money, definitely.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|its a pretty cool little game.  the graphics are decent.  confusing at times and hit the hint button more then once.  worth the money I paid.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this story from start to finish!<br />The characters were all wonderful, they were fun to visualize and &#34;watch&#34; them as they went through all the drama that had been pressed upon them... The whole bad girl gone good meets total bad boy was amazing! I can't wait for Walking disaster which is from Travis POV ((:<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B003XT603Q|4.0|The book is great the movie, terrrrrible. Racier than I expected. A bit episodic, still wonder why Toru falls in love with Midori so much though.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A very compelling story that you can not put down.  We think about the best and worst in our nature and in others and hope to have the same courage as we face our own demons.
B004DM0UII|5.0|great to be able to listen to a variety of music..set a mood...fill emptiness with this app as long as I have access to my devices.  great free app!
B004GEB9UQ|5.0|Everything in this book about how human beings should eat is just common sense.<br />If more people would follow Dr.Cordain's advice, and start popping more fruit and veggies into their mouths, there'd be much less need for pill popping!! Revolt!! Eat the Paleo way!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This is a very good book I definitely think people should read it. It's the best book I have ever seen
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Never would have thought stick figures could be fun again. Game has a great game-play and fun levels. Simple graphics only compliment the nature of the game.
B002RI9UBS|3.0|It was different to other books I normally read. I found there were sections that I skipped through as it went on and on about nothing in particular. The eventual journey was well written and believable. I enjoyed the second half of the book, after perseverance. Not for everyone.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If you are looking for a book that does not require a lot of grey matter and escape for a while this is a good story and an easy read.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Don't know why FX On Demand on DirecTV pulls their current shows after 3 episodes at time and has them expire on the DVR except of course to have to buy them here.  Only network that does that. Hate spending $1.99 per episode to get caught up when I'll be buying the Blu-ray soon as it comes out. Still- GREAT show!
0385536828|5.0|The romance is written in the typical context of the Cold War, that is the England of 1970.<br />It exists a perticular corrispondence between the world of the spies and the world of the literature.<br />The two different back-ground have often some interactions, but they remain separated because everyone has a its coherence.<br />But it is very uneasy to mantain this condition, because the difference between life and reallity few time can be avoided.<br />The style is always elegant, but it is possible to observe an evolution by this view.<br />The style is more fluent if the psychological work is left to the fantasy of the lector.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a great book to read I was laughing on almost every page. I would read it every day.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Utterly amazing. So many unexpected twists and turns.  Couldn't put it down. Fantastically intriguing and riveting storyline, on to the next one
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat.  Colleen does it again with Hopeless.  It was unexpected and sweet.  The relationship between the characters was very real.  I loved this book!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is really addicting and I cant put my kindle down when I'm playing it. I have projects due but its so hard to put the kindle down.
B005544V6A|5.0|I would highly reccomend this program.  The characters play so well off each other and the storyline is always compelling.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|As is usual for this author, the writing, characters and plot is first class and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story.
1449410243|5.0|I'm more or less a regular Oatmeal reader and a huge fan. I bought this book for my girlfriend because she and her parents own two cats. They were all literally laughing tears while reading it!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I chose this album because I love Taylor Swift! And she did not disappoint! I am a mom, so I appreciate the fact that Taylor puts out music that I can enjoy with my daughter!
B004AHNIGM|5.0|OMG, where to begin. I love this CD. I did not realize how much I missed Gregg's vocals until I heard this. This is just a great collection of tunes and 12 bar blues!  I hope he gets back in the studio.... there are tons more songs I need to hear by this individual!
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|The songs were from the show, but some of them I just choose not to listen to because they are too twangy, I like more of the modern country twist myself.  I love the cd though.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Story line was good, but the 3D effects were lacking, not much of a 3D look to it like other 3D movies I've watched. So those of you that were going to purchase this version of this movie don't waste your money, just get the regular DVD or Blu-Ray disk.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It is a great game. U should get it. Me, my sister, and my dad love playing it together. It is one of me and my sister's favorite app. It is super fun. My little brother watches me play it on my kindle.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My husband turned me on to this series and I immediatly fell in love with it.  I enjoyed it so much I have since bought all the other books written by Hugh Howey and COMPLETELY enjoyed each and every one.  I look forward to the next place Hugh's imagination takes me!!
B006M7JCC2|3.0|This book is really interesting and I loved reading the first 2/3 but then it got a little slow and repetitive.
B003VGD354|5.0|he acts alot like jon pertwees doctor in this episode several facial expressions and that look of convenience that there going to be alright.
B005QBBCMI|4.0|A story & unfortunate reality that needs to be acknowledged today. I have seen people in my lifetime that were as lost in their addictions as the characters portraid in this movie.
B00009XITQ|4.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Amanda Bynes or a Chick Flick fan.  I enjoy this movie although I don't watch it all the time.  I was and am satisfied with the purchase I made.  I went ahead and spent a little more for the DVD for the assurance that it was coming from Amazon itself, instead of another seller (which given the chance I wouldn't worry so much about now that I know more about Amazon and how it works.  I ordered this DVD when I was a newbie to Amazon).
B00687Q0VC|5.0|Television entertainment at its absolute BEST!!! History lesson & entertaining at the same time. I truly hope other other producers provide more content like this.
B00899F0G8|4.0|I highly recommend this to any Pretty Little Liars Fan.  It was worth the money I had to pay to get the episode I missed.  The quality of the download was GREAT, and I was impressed that I was able to watch it on my computer, and then have it in my library to re-watch anytime I want.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Loved this one from beginning to end! Also, to truly get the full effect, you must also see Before Sunrise. Great Acting, Great Story!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was perfect. It was breathtaking! You have to read this book. Colleen Hoover is an amazing author!  This book changed my life.  Must read!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|The best one I like the extreme scaters lollipop<br />Bush changed myself and my profile I'm a few years old I liked if when Greg took the blame for rowley
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I've loved all 3 of Gillian Flynn's books. They are written very well and always have big twists and turns you don't see coming! Very entertaining!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Very refreshing and insightful !! Very modern day breakfast club with brilliant quotes I will not forget ! Want to read all over again
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My granddaughter kept after me to read this series.  I wasn't interested since it is supposed to be for young adults.  After reading the reviews from other parents and grandparents, I decided to give it a try and after the first book I was hooked.  Loved them all and read them all in about two weeks which is good for me since I don't have a lot of reading time.  Very good series!
B008M721MS|5.0|i love this so much i can contact my family in mexico its very fun to use and my brothers like it to
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was very sad to read but I am so happy she was able to tell her story.  What a remarkable woman she turned out to be in spite of the circumstances she grew up in.  Unbelievable that this kind of thing can still happen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was so gooooood. It really bad a good story line and kept me intrigued. I finished it in three days.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a young adult book and I am far from that but loved the book.  Great characters and story.  I think every young person should read it but also adults.
B005FITIGO|4.0|Stunning and yet so believable. It makes you want to be more careful where and how you invest your money
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is for young adults and I am far from that, but I loved all of the books in this series.
1469984202|1.0|Hello!<br /><br />I gave this a read after the many positive reviews. After reading it, I can only conclude that most of the positive reviews are fakes. (Don't believe me? Check and see how many of the positive reviewers have reviewed ONLY one book, this one!)<br /><br />(BRAVO! Just TODAY, the 17th of May, 2013, Amazon has deleted over 3,000 FAKE 5 star reviews of this book! YAY!!! (Hmmm, after about a week, they seem to have returned. Oh, well.))<br /><br />As my title says, it is simply a shameless, poor rip-off of the movie \\"City of Ember\\". While City of Ember wasn't a great movie, even being a children's movie, it was certainly better than \\"Wool - Omnibus Edition\\".<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW! SPOILERS BELOW! SPOILERS BELOW! SPOILERS BELOW!<br /><br />I have read MANY end of the world stories and books dealing with survivors living underground. This book, however, was obviously lifted straight from City of Ember.<br /><br />Similar plot points:<br /><br />1. Evil mayor running the underground city, who secretly kills when it suits him.<br /><br />2. Pages running around delivering PHYSICAL messages that you have to pay for! (With multiple floors devoted to computers, and computers in everyone's living quarters?????? At least in City of Ember, there wasn't much technology left!)<br /><br />3. Scene with Jules wielding a huge, huge wrench (...\\"nearly as long as she was tall\\") on a generator, very similar to a scene with Martin Landau in City of Ember.<br /><br />4. An apprentice system of learning. (Don't they have any schools in this place with computers everywhere?)<br /><br />5. Unawareness of what is really outside.<br /><br />6. No memories of the previous times.<br /><br />7. Serious problems with their main generator.<br /><br />In fact, with only minor rewriting, Wool could've been a prequel to City of Ember.<br /><br />Things that are out and out idiotic:<br /><br />1. Computers that keep running for HUNDREDS of years? Dream on! 99.9% of the computers should've been dead by then. (To those that have read the book, yes, they had workshops to manufacture things. BUT, NOTHING nearly as complex as hard drives, processors, etc. They barely had the technology to fix their main generator!). A special point was made that the computers were original, and NOT new ones pulled out of storage (after that long, even NEW ones would fail!)<br /><br />2. Pages running around physical messages, with thousands?, tens of thousands? of computers in close proximity, easily networked. (This is the lame excuse in the book: \\"Can you think of why it's cheaper to porter a paper note to someone than it is to just wire them from a computer?\\"<br /> \\"Oh, sure.\\" He nodded. \\"It's a quarter chit per character to wire someone. That adds up!\\". These people must be low-grade morons: 1. For ANYONE to buy this lame excuse. 2. For someone NOT to think of networking the computers on virtually a daily basis in the silo complex.<br /><br />3. Running wires UNDER WATER to hook up a pump that is already submerged in groundwater, presumably full of salts. How, pray tell, are you supposed to keep the live connections INSULATED from the water, to keep it from shorting out? Something that the character doing it never even thought about, by the way.<br /><br />4. A walkie talkie/radio that transmits from 1,000 feet underground to a location miles away that is ALSO 1,000 feet underground (NO external antenna)! (Anyone who has ever used a cell phone, should be rolling of the floor, laughing, at this point!)<br /><br />The author knows NOTHING about simple electricity, or technical matters of any kind (and should refrain from writing about them).<br /><br />A. See 1, 2, 3, and 4 above.<br /><br />B. Deadly toxic gases lasting for HUNDREDS of years? The rain would wash enough out in a few decades, at most. (NO nuclear winter, by the way, in the book.)<br /><br />C. Computers eating up a quarter of all the energy in the complex? Unlikely.<br /><br />The author, humorously, has also self-published a novella called: \\"The Plagiarist: A Novella\\". Apparently he is laughing at readers who has not caught his blatant plagiarism of \\"City of Ember\\".<br /><br />The author's writing style is, at best, mediocre. Many people have pointed out the tedious, long descriptive pages. (Indeed, there are MANY points where several pages could be reduced to a paragraph, or even a single line.)<br /><br />Now, I like descriptive passages that actually serve some purpose. But most of these (especially in the latter part of the book), seem to be mainly to fill pages. I have just re-read \\"Lord of the Rings\\", and Tolkien has a lot of description, BUT his description serves a purpose. This author's does not.<br /><br />Just by removing the unneeded, useless description, you would remove about 2/3's of the book.<br /><br />Also, if you like getting involved in a character, you can just about forget it. The author delights in killing the MAIN character, about every 50 pages or so, and starting up a NEW main character.<br /><br />My thumb is WAY, WAY down on this book. AVOID this!<br /><br />Karl<br /><br />SPOILERS ABOVE! SPOILERS ABOVE! SPOILERS ABOVE! SPOILERS ABOVE!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is for young adults and I am far from that, but I loved all of the books in this series.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I think I heard about Wool on Goodreads. I read a lot of sci-fi and this got good reviews so I checked it out on Amazon. Then, I saw that I could get all 5 on the Wool Omnibus Edition.... for 5.99, no brainer, I got Omnibus. The only thing I didn't like is that it finally ended, but in the \\"interview\\" at the end there seems to be a possible promise of more to come. There certainly are many ways for this to play out. Keeping my fingers crossed.<br /><br />The story takes place sometime in the future when the world is uninhabitable so life has moved into a silo. That's all I'm saying about that. Trust me, it is a good story, great plot, keep you on the edge of your seat twists, people you really fall in love with and a bad guy you really hate.<br /><br />I have to checkout his other books. I want to buy them before he gets famous and expensive : )
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Chose this because it fills my need for weather updates. Have used it for years on PC and Mac. Usually pretty accurate and updates are frequent.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app is just a pain to operate.  The Windows Phone version is much better.  Go directly to the m.Facebook.com page - don't bother with this one.
0062082353|5.0|Another one of my summer reads (a period which extended into late fall...), this book delves deep into what goes into the making of one of our many unsung military heroes. The book also pays tribute to those that have fallen in the defense of our great nation. Insight is given into what makes up the mindset of those who have taken up the challenge of military service, oftentimes at great sacrafice and peril. We owe a debt of gratitude to these brave men and women.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I had bloons tower defense 4 and had been waiting for the new one to come out and it is the best game ever! definetly worth the 3 bucks
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|honestly, i usually don't watch these shows because they freak me out but i started watching season one on netflix and became instantly OBSESSED!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was a very funny movie that had good points, but still kept it light. A great balance. I liked it so much that i watched it several times before the rental time had expired. I usually don't do that. It was a great strong female-role-filled comedy, which i love to see.
B0086213XW|2.0|This movie is, above all else, sexy and frustrating. There are scenes that are downright smoking hot, but the overall arc is disappointing and leaves the viewer with much to be desired. Seth Rogen's and Sarah Silverman's characters are the ones that shine, while in reality they play only minimally supporting roles. Michelle Williams is written a great part here, but leaves a lot on the table and doesn't truly convince the audience of her passion, or her melancholy. Seth Rogen acts his part much better, but it is one that is frustratingly written, and it isn't until the end of the movie that he gets any semblance of redemption. There is also ample full nudity here, in scenes that make the audience wonder \\"Why?\\"<br /><br />Overall, this is a movie that tries to portray the struggles and monotony of everyday life, but fails to do so convincingly. The plot is strained at times, and when it flows the characters seem strained. It would be excessive to call this a waste of two hours, but this is not an award winner for sure.
B009VB97EY|1.0|The previews were incredibly deceiving. They marketed this movie toward women, with promises of a romance-comedy with reversed male and female roles than the typical romance-comedies. It was a full-on drama, which i do not usually watch. I, as a woman, was also promised eye-candy. Not the case. Sure, there were beautiful bodied men dancing about, but the story line just felt forced therefore completely outweighing the fun of seeing Chippendale-like shows. I'm sorry, but once there is substance abuse, betrayal, and death...you lose the fun in it. I just don't know what the producers where thinking. I do not recommend it to my friends and i do not recommend it to you.<br /><br />ONLY WATCH if you have a firm understanding that it is a DRAMA, not a romance-comedy.
1401322786|5.0|In the Time Keeper, Mitch Albom captures your attention form the beginning of this story and holds it to the end.  Each character in the book has a lesson to be shared with each one of us and how we use time, it's importance in our lives and how that importance can be changed. Dor, the creator of the first way of keeping time is punished by God for bringing into the world a way of measuring the passing of time.  He is required to help others and in doing so to change the outcome of his own life.  It is a book that I could not put down and read from start to finish.  It is an excellent book and I highly recomend to young teen aged readers as well as adults.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|My 7 y/o son loved this movie so much that we watched it over and over for 3 days. He never got tired of it.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|I loved it.  Especially when he asks the nuclear scientist why the nuclear missile is not pointy.  Can't go wrong with Sasha Barron Cohen.  If you liked Borat, you'll love this movie.  If you didn't like Borat, you may not like this movie either, but it's worth a try.
B009JBZH54|5.0|There's tons of content and of course the films themselves are spectacular. Comes with UV copies  and a booklet. Worth the price.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I don't know how I ever lived without Evernote.  I have the full version on my computer and use it to capture confirmation numbers, telephone numbers, addresses, names of things to buy at the store... etc.  Having this app for on the go helps me to pull all of that info up when needed.  Very helpful when I am away from home and need information.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this book and read it in one day.  Nicholas sparks is my all time favorite author.
034580404X|5.0|I was a little skeptical about these books at first because I am not usually interested in sexy books. The characters are interesting and the books are more than just sex. There is a lot of drama and events to keep things interesting. The only flaws that I saw were that the author uses a lot of words over and over again, and at times the sex scenes were exhausting to read. Other than that they are great books. I'm already re-reading them!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is the best game ever I love playing it with my friends and u meet new people and get better at drawing
B0076DELIG|5.0|I enjoyed this book, Harry is like going back and visiting an old friend. He, honest hard working and not affraid to get in anybodies face for a challenge.
1451620829|5.0|I knew when Peter finally got around to release a book, his would be the best.  Unlike Ace's book, it wasn't a \\"taking a trip down memory lane of taking drugs and how to smuggle them\\"; Unlike Gene's, it wasn't a book soaked with egotism and slamming half the people he worked with; Unlike KISSTORY, it wasn't a self-righteous and expensive escapade.  MAKE UP TO BREAK UP covers much of what I wanted to read about...KISS.    Yes, it's supposed to be a bio on Peter, but Peter gave many of us what we wanted: A background on his life (just in the 1st 2 chapters), yet talked about some of the processes in recording the albums--like DESTROYER, his relationships with Gene, Paul, Ace, Sean and Bill; Stuff that happened on the road; Info. on what went into the stage show and so on.    This book, I feel, was a very honest representation of the 70's KISS.  I also feel he has also been the most honest about how the wheeling and dealings occurred when the original 4 reunited in the mid 1990s.    I will be honest and say Peter always has been my least fav KISS drummer, but I will always respect him as an original member and a guy that brought KISS to stardom with his song BETH.  Peter also sang on some of the best KISS songs like BLACK DIAMOND, STRANGE WAYS and HARD LUCK WOMAN.  Peter's drumming style was jazzy and brought a professional mix to early KISS--His drumming on such songs like ROCK N ROLL ALL NITE, HOTTER THAN HELL, LOVE GUN, DEUCE and MAKIN' LOVE was some of his musical highlights as a drummer.  I loved Eric Carr, for he seemed to give his all into every performance that I have seen on old KISS footage and his drums were just amazing on every album he was featured on.  I did like Eric Singer the most during the Revenge Era--for it seemed he mixed both Peter and Eric Carr's style together along with his own technical flavor, but since he has rejoined KISS as Catman #2, it seems Singer holds out and tries too much to act like Peter rather than himself behind the drums (Which I am sure is influenced to be done via Stanley and Simmons).    I think Gene, Paul, Doc and even Ace screwed Peter when he reunited with KISS and that was such a shame.  A drummer works very hard behind the drums--And Peter was the oldest KISS member.  For him to be paid less than even the likes of Tommy Thayer was not cool at all.  And I will believe Peter's story, for I always saw in Peter's face whenever he talked in interviews--he's not a bulls***ter--He seems to be a sincere guy (I've met all members of KISS expect Eric Carr and Tommy Thayer, Peter was one of the nicest--he even hugged me twice)!    I wish Peter well and hope he will be able to live happy and healthy for the rest of his life.  I know he did much for the fans playing many shows in pain.  It's too bad that Paul, Gene, Doc and Ace didn't treat him with more respect--But the fans will always have the great memories of the TRUE CAT behind the drums!    Peter, thanks for writing the best KISS book ever written.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|its moving to the top of my must read list! and I dont normally do that for a book with characters so young but it was just soooooo good I cant NOT recommend it. The twists will floor you, the emotion in just a touch will make your toes curl. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|wonderful knife. i keep it on me everywhere i go. always has a use. I have used it for everything from defense purposes to farm use and it does not fail to impress.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|this book was good. I read it because I heard they were making it into a movie. I wasnt preparred for the lack of ooey gooey love that was not in this story. BUT i loved that about it. It made me laugh really hard and cry a little bit. breath of fresh air to the typical happily ever after
B005VPRETE|4.0|My 5 year old granddaughter sat down and put it together in 2 hours and loved it.  I would recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I recommend this book to older &#34;young adults&#34; Its not a high school or college love story, its a grown adults learning from their mistakes story. Wonderful story just like every other story Nicolas Sparks writes!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Very interesting, entertaining, and informative account of his life, his running career and his transition toward vegetarianism. Great tips for runners, people wanting to eat healthier and even live a happier life.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book, it went back and forth a little too much for me but I enjoyed it very much! The girls past isnt a typical past that you find in the YA books and his crazy past doesnt scare her away. I liked it for being different.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is awesome i love it so much. wish theree were more games like this. i love animals too!!!!!!
B005JABSB6|5.0|Easy and comfortable to use. Large frame blocks other light that may be in the room. Seem to have a long battery life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's about time an app like this has come to the kindle fire. My friend got this app a few months before  it came on the kindle. Minecraft is literally the best gaming achievement I've ever seen (besides Call of Duty Black Ops 2). I saw on YouTube that you can make roller coasters, but it seems as though there isn't yet an update so I'm waiting for that. Anyway, get this app if you like legos.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such an amazing book! Couldn't put it down! Felt like I was in the story! Suzanne Collins is such an amazing author
0753539470|4.0|I would have given it five stars, but I am retired, and much of it does not apply to my lifestyle.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this games really fun,brain stimulating, and tricky all in one.i have been playing for a while and have become addicted. I NEVER REVIEWED THIS PRODUCT! I DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS GOT INTO MY REVIEW LIST, MAYBE AMAZON SHOULD CHECK THIS OUT, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED!
B007SNMYNS|3.0|I did not like the way it was written, it did not make me want to read on.  It is very interesting how our food is being engineered.  We should pay attention to the side effects of our food, the same as we do for prescription drugs.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was phenomenal. I couldn't even put it down. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. So worth it!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved Pillars of the Earth.  This book and the previous book in the trilogy brings history alive.  This trilogy is a must read, you will feel part of history
B008OOYALE|5.0|Before I played this game, I thought that t his was another stupid game they try selling these days but then I realized I was wrong. This was the greatest game I've ever played in my life! I recommend this app to all those gamers out there!!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first it seems too simple to be fun but wait 'till you get to those higher levels, it will frustrate you!
1451695195|5.0|A very good book. Tells the story of Dr. Alexanders personel sickness and his involvment. Easy reading.  A true addition for the library.
B0033TI4BW|4.0|Finally, a book that puts paid to the idea that people are only motivated by money or material things! While money and things like car/house packages are necessary and make life more bearable, it is often not the primary motivator in the workplace.  People need to feel useful, engaged, undertake meaningful work and feel that they are positively contributing.  This is why volunteerism works so well - once your basic (and even not so basic) needs are taken care of, work/employment/filling your day needs to meet other needs.  This is a good book to look at motivators other than money while acknowleding that money is still necessary to fulfil basic needs.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Love the show. It just seems that every episode has a few stupid moments that would raise a red flag for any logically minded person. Besides those few moments, the rest of the show is great fun.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|The cd arrived quickly and in good condition.  The songs are up beat and like the band, fun!  Listening to it puts me in a good mood.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|Love the show. It just seems that every episode has a few stupid moments that would raise a red flag for any logically minded person. Besides those few moments, the rest of the show is great fun.
B007F7XXKA|5.0|The book provides a broad macroeconomic overview of the emerging markets. It contains an tremendous number of interesting facts and thoughtful conclusions on the future economic perspectives of different regions of the world. I read the book twice to fully absorb the information. A must read for anybody investing in foreign countries or conducting business there. I've been to the majority of the countries the author described on business trips but I feel like I learned from the book more than I've learned during my trips. As an investment group head the author had the luxury of superbly qualified resources to collect and classify the information he presented. The book is outstanding.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I love this movie!  I wanted this particular edition because it has a lot of the extras that gives you a lot more insight to the history of the Spartans and the making of the movie.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of this movie.
075669812X|5.0|This book comes with a mini figure.<br />My grandson is really into Ninjago so this book is something that he looks at a lot.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a brilliant written book and thoroughly enjoyed and well written would recommend it as a very relaxing read
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great game, a bit addicting. Wish money regenerated faster but overall fun to play. Only drawback is that it's tempting to spend actual money to play quicker but is not required.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app is fun for kids because they can unlock more ponies. My daughter is 12 and she loves it.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|If you do anything with wireless networking this is a required app.  I was disappointed when I got my Ipad that this technology is not available on apple devices.  Now I'm back to an android phone and I've got it again.<br />You can see anything that may be interfering and with that information change the channel of your router/ AP to reduce interference.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|It has many pithy, quotable comments, the concept of our hidden vs. our public persona.  Not light reading, though thought provoking
B0086700CM|5.0|great graphics, fun challenging. good for preteens to adults. Lots of fun for a free game. Our granddaughter age 11 is great at it, and likes it.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Love, love, love Castle! I usually watch it too fast and can't wait to get the next season! The characters are great and have a great charisma/acting compatibility. The crimes are unimaginables; the story line is great... I can't say it enough... I love it!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|The graphics are great and it has a good story line. This is a murder mystery so there are bodies. It may not be suitable for younger children. There are puzzles to figure out.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Worthless, a total waste of time, if this is the best ou can do, I'll switch to an I-pad, and soon
B005HSL626|3.0|I gave the game a 3 star because it has too many pop up ads. The game is great and fun for everyone.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|chess rocks its my favorate game in the world so now I can pull it out and play easy,  med,  and hard. CHESS!!!!!!!!
B000UBMSB8|4.0|Well it does say &#34;Collector's Edition&#34;.  Seriously though if you grew up in the 80's and grew up watching this every time it was on TV then this is for you.  In addition to the 4 versions, the set is packed with extras.  Some of the featurettes will include new bits of information and definitely new footage and interviews.  If your a fan of Blade Runner, Harrison Ford, Ridley Scott or dark dystopian futures then its definite buy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story.  Believable characters.  Lots of suspense in the end. First Nicholas Sparks I've read, and have read several more since.
0756404738|4.0|I loved the first book. I like the second one.  I am sure it is difficult to follow up on a book like &#34;The Name of the Wind&#34;.  But, Mr. Rothfuss does so adequately if not exceptionally.  I say this not to disparage the second book because it is a good read and definitely keeps me waiting for next book.  This book lacked a certain something from the first book that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Perhaps when I do a re-read I'll figure it out.<br /><br />With that said, &#34;Wise Man's Fear&#34; is still a solid read.  Kvothe enters a new stage in his story as he enters a new stage in his life.  This is slowly but obviously leading us to where the very first book starts, with Kvothe at the inn.  So now I wait patiently for book 3.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this backpack.  I was able to get everything I need in it, and still have room for more!  Well worth the money.
B007HACDLK|5.0|After the waiting this book turned out as good as the other Rapp adventures. The other people in this book helped in developing the store. They are ever the bad guys and you will be drawn into how they cause events to happen. This is again the Vince Flynn book that we all enjoy reading and wondering are there really people like this??
B007SGM084|5.0|I gave it a five star rating because I think it is a fantastic read and an attention getter. It's an interesting way to portray the issues and trials that they do through.<br />I think it can be read from many different viewpoints and was written quite well. I look forward to the movie and subsequent books on Christian and Anastasia and their families.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|It was different and I did enjoy it but I would not say, Wow, I need to recommend that book to someone.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|streaming was hd quality would like to see amazon stream it in 7.1 audio output. Trilogy ended very well with good content
B0091WAN3C|4.0|Just saw Dark Knight Rises and I just had to watch The Dark Knight again. It is a much more entertaining film and one of the all time classic comic book movies. Epic performance by Heath Ledger.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Need a way to earn more nuts. Lots of fun. Wish I had more friends to invite. I  also like my monster rancher.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I was looking for a new game to get then I saw this one and it looked like a ASSOM  game to buy
B005LAII94|4.0|I liked this movie as I thought it was a good combination of the plot and action with a good storyline.  We watched the unrated version and it is violent and macabre with sexual situations in the story.  The movie is about a hostile takeover of a California pot producer and distributor by a Mexican drug cartel.<br /><br />I won't ruin the movie or the plot for you but I found the movie interesting and it was better than average.  It is worth renting it if you like this type of movie and I thought the acting was good and the storyline was intriguing and interesting to follow.  I don't think most people would watch this movie more than once so renting it is probably the best deal.<br /><br />It has a lot of action scenes and sexual innuendos in the movie and the interaction with the three main characters is like a three way love triangle between beautiful savages. I rate this film a 4 star movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I avoided this book because it was almost too popular, what with all the publicity of the book and the movie. However, when it went on sale I finally decided to take the plunge and give it a shot. Wow - could not get the next in the series fast enough when I finished this one. I&#34;m now more than half way through &#34;Catching Fire&#34; and am looking forward to the next book as well. I'll be sad to finish them all.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey) is a sharp as a tack lawyer who takes the defense side for criminals and helps to get them off with reduced sentences or no conviction at all.  He is good at his job, really good! He gets called into a case to help get a young rich man off on the charges of assault and battery and he finds out that he and the young man have more in common than he believes and risks his very survival in taking the case....<br /><br />This is an excellent film with a good plot that twists and turns and makes a good story that is well acted out.  I enjoyed this film so much that I just recently watched it again on the Amazon Instant Video system using my Prime account. I enjoyed watching the slick and fast thinking Haller trick other lawyers, his clients and even the judges to get the results he wanted.  It is a deep movie and I recommend it to you as one worth owning.  I like Matthew McConaughey as an actor and he and the entire cast did a good job playing their roles in this movie.  I rate it 5 stars for the entertainment value.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Came perfect no scratches,no fakes , NOTHING WRONG WITH IT AT ALL and the movies were AMAZING I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING IT CUZ THE PRICE AND THE AMAZING MOVIES
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed this book  as a quick  read. It didn't seem to go into great detail but just enough to keep you entertained. I'm looking forward to reading the next 2 in the series..
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved the whole book and Charlie. Perfection. True perfection. I can't stress it enough. But I'm glad I read this.
B0074AGVWK|5.0|Full House, entertaining, realistic,easy to read and very enjoyable.  Love al Maeve Binchy's books been reading them for years now
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I loved the whole movie, esspecially the ending.  Is he or isn't he, that is the question that bears answering.
B00867GJYK|2.0|\\"Finding Nemo\\" is a new classic for both the Mouse House and Pixar and continues to charm children of all ages. This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who follows the success of Pixar, who very rarely has a miss among its hits.<br /><br />Little clownfish Nemo is caught by a diver and taken away from his home in the Great Barrier Reef. While he tries to find a way to escape from his life of captivity in a fish tank full of other interesting characters, his father Marlin sets out on a search for Nemo. He encounters all sorts of dangerous and eccentric aquatic personalities. Can Marlin and Nemo survive their misadventures and reunite with each other?<br /><br />This is another example of a Pixar film I just don't enjoy. It trudges along at a pace too slow for my tastes. My opinion doesn't matter when the film is aimed at children and parents who love it.<br /><br />It does have its moments. I enjoy the sequence with the sharks. I think this has more to do with the fact that filmmakers chose to name the great white shark Bruce in homage to the mechanical one Steven Spielberg used while directing \\"Jaws.\\" It's also one of the more exciting moments in \\"Finding Nemo.\\"<br /><br />The movie carries a great message about the importance of family. It's also a cautionary tale pounding home how important it is for children to obey their parents for their own safety. Strangely, it somehow delivers an edict addressing overprotective parents who won't give their children room to grow on their own.<br /><br />I doubt my dispassion for \\"Finding Nemo\\" will keep anyone from watching or purchasing this new Blu-ray edition. Who am I to argue with the members of the Academy or millions of people who love it?
B004EPYZSK|2.0|Would not recommend this movie to anyone able to form two or more sylables. I had the movie recommended by a friend and I need to hold an intervention for Him since He actually liked this bag of kitty litter. The actors must of been hard up for money because I have no idea why they would star in this vehicle of imbrededness.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Must see tv show, my husband and I stayed up all night watching it. I have never been more addicted in my life.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love Ellen but if you've watched every one of her shows, like I, then you've heard her say most of what she wrote in here.
0743289684|4.0|I learned what I wanted to know directly from a contemporary source who writes in a candid style for a non-native English speaker.  Even though she did live there very briefly as a young child, I only wish she had grown up in Saudi Arabia where the purest form of Muslim life exists and is practiced.  Since she grew up on the African continent, I learned that being Muslim there was/is different than in Saudi.  However, her life experience did give me a good flavor of how the Quoran dominates all facets of human life and endeavor and totally subjugates females.  It's scary to think that this religion of literalism, barbaric practices, and unabashed outright disdain of non-Muslims (&#34;the infidels&#34;) is slowly infiltrating the West.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|A three disc collector's edition set for the price of a regular single disc edition. A breakthrough movie experience combining state-of-the-art CGI with live action. An exciting story with an important underlying message to all of us here on Earth.
B00569LSUG|4.0|This is great.  Hooks abound per song. My 3 AM album<br />Already rated Lonerism 5 stars which is great right through the closing waltz.
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|I expected 2 discs, but didnt realize the one disc can be used as 3d and just blue ray. Good movie
B007HC3LHS|5.0|if your looking for a book that will keep you up late into the night because you just have to see whats next, this book is it.  It  gives a real insight on how people can be transformed from the person they once were into someone else completely due to the influence of another.  great read.....highly reccomended
B007MDB548|4.0|Loved the fact that there is a 3d blue ray disc, a blue ray disc and a dvd copy for regular recorders.
0425221806|5.0|I am a huge Dean Koontz fan and this was one of the best works I've ever read by him, or anyone else for that matter!  This book scared me so bad that I would actually look over my shoulder as I turned out the lights and headed to bed....seriously.  There have been very few books I've read that have actually scared me but this one did the job!  If you're looking for a great book that will keep you turning page after page and hour after hour then this is the book!  I stayed up WAY too late reading this:)  I don't want to give anything away but what I think I enjoyed the most was Koontz's ability to make me feel sympathy for characters I didn't think I would feel sympathy for!
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|TEMPEST IS THE BEST DYLAN ALBLUM FOR MANY YEARS.  SCARLET TOWN AND TIN ANGEL SPORT GREAT LYRICS LIKE THE DYLAN OF OLD.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't stop reading. Suspenseful with great visualization putting me right in the arena. Excited for book 3 to see if and how they'll take down the capitol!

1442355476|5.0|One of my fav authors...the book was good and I always read his latest writings.  That is all I have to say
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob was a great book and would make a great movie. (Hope this is in the works!)<br />It held my interest throughout and of course the surprise ending capped it off.
0425264351|5.0|Was interesting book and wanted to read the 1st book of the series.  Will continue to find the books I haven't read<br />about this character
B000053W01|5.0|Can anyone today even come close to the voice of Karen Carpenter?<br />I think not. The only problem is the sadness I feel at the loss of such a gift.<br />Kinda like the Patsy Cline of the 70's.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|There is some cool action in the video, but basically its a wimpy batman, and the plot did not keep me interested.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I wanted to see this in the theater over the summer, I was unable to... So I finally get to see it online and it was worth it. One of better flicks I've seen recently, and if anything, at least it's not a damn REMAKE that hollywoods loves to enforce, purely by LACK OF originality, creativity, and writing talent. - Otherwise, it was a good story, and I was actually impressed with Gordon-Levitt's portrayal of a younger Willis.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|LOVE, LOVE,LOVE! Fascinating insights into life in the lives of the rich and their lifestyle as well as the individuals who are employed to support them. very rich story line.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great book. Couldn't' stop reading.  Can't wait for next book.  Great characters and plot once again.  COULD READ IT AGAIN
1400069289|5.0|Very helpful to understand why we do what we do on many levels and how to avoid traps buisness set to entice us to buy stuff.

B005NNUKF4|5.0|Pink Floyd's music is some of the most unique and underrated of all time.  If you've never experienced them you owe it to yourself to give them a try.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to know the ending but without getting to the end.The author held my attention and painted a perfect picture in every chapter.Would definitely recommend this book and author to everyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed The Hunger Games and &#34;Catching Fire is almost as good as the first.<br />I like to read it on my Kindel.  It is at t the right spot when I open it up.  No searching<br />around.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Ok this was fantastic for 15 seconds when an add popped up so I closed it and got a message (another add) saying tap here to remove adds so I tap there and it cost money so now I'm stuck with a game with ad pop ups every 30 seconds. Otherwise great game
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If I'm being honest, I'm slightly speechless at the moment. Colleen Hoover is a one of the best authors and, her books are works of art that I could read over and over. Her books fill my heart with so much emotion... I don't really know what else to say other than this is one of the best books I've ever read and I HIGHLY recommend that everyone read it.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|there is good and bad the good part is its fun the bad is you have to pay 2 more bucks that means total you have to pay 5 dollars to get everything
B008I34Y6W|5.0|In the 60s & 70s I owned 27 Zappa albums. This was one of them. I cannot afford to replace all the records with CDs at once but will over time do it. Inca Roads is one of the finest examples of Zappa/Duke you will find
B000FC2KL0|1.0|The only thing I learned from this book is that Anthony is a pedophile (having sex with teenagers), drug addict.  Nothing more, Nothing less.  And then to brag about the disgusting things he has done is unbelievable
0307943232|4.0|Listen to this in Audio, enjoyed the flow and the story, felt I was there, lived both in the south and north, made it more understandable. The build up and story kept you on your toes,I felt the end came to fast, only 6 or 7 disc, too short. It makes you think, that if things really go on like this, what has our world come to. In short we as a country need to take it back from what these right wing politcos have done to our country to remove the middle class that stories can go on like this. I would give this a good rating and would make a good movie if done right.
B008I43DYU|5.0|nice to have a calculator handy on my kindle. easy to use, easy to use and app is free :)
031603441X|5.0|Everything we always wanted to know what why and how the true facts are in this book. Rock and ROLL folklore in its truest form. The beauty of Exile and its recordings and why today nothing touches it. Johnny Depp reading was wonderful in early chapters, you felt you were Keith's best friend as a kid, he was the bud you had or always wished you had. Next guest speaker was great, you thought Keith was sitting there talking to you. I loved when Keith did a couple chapters, in his voice. This audio book told the story that we always thought we knew, but the facts were coming at us over the years blown way out. This finnally gave us the true facts about Brian, he was his worst enemy, and Keith tried so hard on being his friend, time in and time out. He was just to short to drive his car and insecure. Keith and Mick are song writers, at its truest form, I do not know how Keith put up with Micks Ego, Mick should every day thank Keith for keeping this band together. Once you earned Keiths, friendship you were a friend for life. I could go on and on, you must listen to this book, I own it in hard back as well, but the reading I do not get what I get, when the story is listened to. You feel you are sitting there with Keith on the couch, in the car or in the room with you. A must in Audio, if you have not ordered it yet, you are missing out. Keith thanks for YOU in true form.!!!!
B004I11VZ0|4.0|Being a fan of the first Ip Man of course I had to watch the sequel. Though I found it entertaining and don't regret purchasing it I personally enjoyed the first one more than this sequel. In my humble opinion the story line was more compelling and the drama more real and intense in the first. But the sequel is still very entertaining with plenty of excellent fight scenes.<br /><br />The setting is British-occupied Hong Kong where we find Ip Man trying to open a martial arts school. He must prove himself as a capable master before the corrupt, locally established Masters will permit him to become an instructor. The climax of the movie is Ip Man's match with the brutal Twister, the British heavy-weight boxing champion. East meets West in this final climactic clash.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|This book takes an idea and spins it into a wonderful, mind-bending<br />journey.  This is a must read for people who love to be enthralled!
B005NQ5LSC|5.0|Being a fan of the Ip Man movies I was a bit hesitant about ordering the prequel because a different actor plays the leading role. I must say, however, that I was very impressed with Dennis To's performance. \\"The Legend is Born\\" tells the story of Ip Man's early years and how he became a Grandmaster of his unique style of Wing Chun. If you enjoy martial arts movies with plenty of excellent fight scenes then add this one to your collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was great book, a lot of action and emotion was packed into this. I highly suggest you read this  Novell.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|Its time for Milla to hang up her weapons as the screenwriters  cannot come up with anything remotely interesting and the special effects hark back to Godzilla vrs. Mothra!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|From the first time I watched the opening cinematic I was enraptured. When going into this I was expecting something that involved more sword fights and bravado than thought with some intense action.  While it is intense, the action involves words, not swords. I honestly never thought that I could enjoy watching people talk to each other so much.<br /><br />It was about halfway through that I realized I was watching a dreaded 'soap opera', and I loved it.<br />If you like compelling characters with complex relations between one another, political intrigue, medieval fantasy, legitimately (but easily spoiled) twists all rolled into a single masterpiece...Then what is there more to say. Watch it You dolt.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I don't know why I finished this book.  The F word turned me off at first (I never repeat books by authors who use it a lot) and then the filthy language only got worse.  I kept thinking the story would get better being it was on the Best Seller for so long.  Wrong! This was probably the worst book I ever read. I am embarassed to have finished it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The perks of being a wallflower is a book that anyone can relate to about being in high school and finding a core group of friends. It's beautifully written and a fantastic portrayal of love and friendship.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|Great movie!! Bought as a Christmas gift to my husband, loved it just as much as the first time we watched it!,,

B000ZNRBK4|4.0|Fits nice and tight over both the filter and lens cap.  Product delivered promptly. Nice compact size and can stay attached in my camera bag.
B00A2BTCM4|3.0|Being a collector of surround music, I was very disappointed in the 5.1 mix, the main reason I bought this. I hadn't heard the original in a couple of decades. I put the disc in and selected the 5.1 mix in the setup. After hearing nothing in the surrounds for a while, I switched to the stereo mix...sounded exactly the same. Perhaps Richard Chycki was too concerned with keeping the 5.1 mix similar to the stereo mix, it's too similar and takes no advantage of the sub or surrounds. Surround mixes usually have a little more punch, but this doesn't. If you were a big fan of this album, you will enjoy the comic book slide show that plays along with the music, very well presented. But if you are expecting an improved mix, it's disappointing. That said, I hope more music is released in 5.1.
B008XG1X18|5.0|very great details.  I hope to use again and again.  love seeing all the pictures and ideas.  i love it
B0084BMUFA|5.0|There is nothing better than rereading the classic story and then watching Alistair Sims play Old Scrooge.  It makes for the perfect Christmas tradition.
B007V508CC|5.0|I have every single maroon 5 album ever put out, and I am certainly in love with this one!  I like the bonus songs, and cannot get enough of this one!
B005LAIISU|4.0|This movie is a good addition to the Ice Age family of films.  It brings back the creativity and fun and that had started to go missing in the last movie.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I never thought I would enjoy a science fiction book, but this was unbelievably good. Recommended for anyone looking for a great story. The only bad part about the book is the ending, but the rest is absolutely fantastic.
B00979CS50|5.0|Great music. I really enjoy the long jams. &#34;Walk like a Gaint&#34; is my favorite. How does he keep putting quality music after all these years?
B00A6N7QIA|4.0|Overall the movie was enjoyable. i enjoy the perspective and style it was presented in. Only thing was i didn't feel that the ending gave the full kind of closure i was expecting
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I Recall the one with Arnie being much better. Don't waste your time. Nothing new to see here. Watch the old one again.
B00007J5VN|5.0|I can't really rate this movie because I bought it for a girl I dated many years ago, who lives thousands of miles from where I do.<br /><br />But, I'm a big Shirley MacLaine fan, and bought the movie for that girl because she always made me think of Shirley MacLaine, way back when we were both young.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Great Camera! i never wanted to stop taking pics and videos. Purchase this camera imediatly. You won't regret it.Ispeak the truth
B003QO8TDC|5.0|I'm a guy.<br /><br />I like girls.<br /><br />I like rock 'n' roll music.<br /><br />This show has it all!<br /><br />I recommend it for guys like me.
0394818237|5.0|Another great book by Richard Scarry!  This is very interesting to children who are interested in what people do and find where they work on the pages..
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I'm a guy.<br /><br />I like girls.<br /><br />I like rock 'n' roll.<br /><br />This movie has all of that.<br /><br />I recommend it for guys like myself.
0061128562|5.0|My granddaughter loved this book also. Was another Read-Aloud book that my children enjoyed. There are several of these with different characters..
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This is sort of a modernized version of Oliver Twist.<br /><br />But, the idea of hearing music in your head all the time - - - ?<br /><br />Hey, it's how I grew up, and I compose songs which I perform &#34;by ear&#34;.<br /><br />So, I know from my own personal experience that part of the story is true.
B001JRB16U|5.0|My granddaughter loves this film. when she was at my home- she watched it twice all the way thru.  She is four years old.
B000068TPN|5.0|I like this movie because I was in that war, although it was many years later, and I was a radio repairman, not an infantry grunt.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works well and is accurate.<br />inserts a status notice on ur kjndle<br />can't ask for more than that!<br />is ad supported
B003ASLJO0|5.0|The only bad thing about this movie was that they didn't portray the truth about Detroit.<br /><br />It's NOT Asian gangs that destroyed that city.<br /><br />Other than &#34;Political Correctness&#34; twisting the story unrealistically, it was typical Clint Eastwood stuff, which all of us guys really dig.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Young adult in the hospital.  It's a story that very well could be true (except the very big words and silly talk) but indeed a great story of how love can change the course of a young persons disease.
B00782O7IY|5.0|I loved this picture, especially the first several scenes with Peppy Miller from the chance encounter with the reporters to the famous &#34;coat comes alive&#34; scene. Two thumbs up!
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I adore this show. The characters and the actors who play them never fail to entertain! My only comment is I hope the writers will &#34;tone down&#34; Sofia Vergara's character a bit next season. She is a bit much, and beginning to get on my nerves with the ranting & raving. Would like to see her have some more intelligent interaction with the others.<br /><br />Other than that small critique, this is BY FAR the best family show on T.V!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham books are al good.What else can I say?I recommend it for adult reading.This requirement is sillyWhy two morewords?.
0062213423|5.0|This was in perfect condition and my daughter loved it!<br />Was exactly as stated in the offer. I will purchase again.

B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I downloaded adobe reader for my kindle for the flash player plug in as the information site I was looking at suggested that this was a good solution. I installed and ran the program with no problems but when I went to view flash games, the Kindle told me it could not support this app as the software installed was not compatible. I am looking for a workaround or other solution but it really isn't a priority... When I web surf I just can not view any sort of video or play any game that is flash based so good bye icanhazcheeseburger and other game pages. The Adobe program itself, I can say nothing about but like Adobe products for my PC.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this was a great alarm clock. I only had a good experience with this app. It had reminder days and times, i could set my own tones or choose for it to vibrate, overall it was awesome. I don't know what the paid app is like but it must be fantastic because the free one is good as is
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is awesome!!!!! I finished it in like 3 days!<br />I love -Annabeth and Percy Jackson-<3 can't wait for the  next book!
B003TNM2K6|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I only paid $3 to rent it and it was worth it. I don't have Netflix or own the movie so this is a great way to watch the movie whenever I want without illegally streaming it.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Probably one of the best books I've ever read. John Grisham did a fantastic job creating a true controversial case that shows the segregation still present in the south.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Purchased for my husband arrived in perfect condition and extremely quick would use and recommend very pleased with product got a great price as well
B0066WJLU6|1.0|I KNEW THE APP WASN'T GOING TO WORK BECAUSE MY KINDLE FIRE DOESN'T HAVE A CAMERA<br /><br />PS I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE I DOWNLOADED THE APP AND THEY TOTALLY LIED. IF OTHER REVIEWERS ARE GOING TO LIE ABOUT THE APP, I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO NOT WRITE A REVIEW AT ALL !!!
B004DM0UII|1.0|I couldn't find the channels I wanted to hear which I could find on other radio apps. there are better options.

B0000VCZKM|5.0|This is my all time favorite childhood movie! It's in stores for 23.99 but it's only 7 on here ! It's a great movie for little girls expecially around 6 & up!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It's so rare to find a book you never want to end, and yet can't read fast enough to get to get there.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|My husband chose this as a movie he'd like to see and, when our daughter failed to order it for him, I did instead, as a Christmas gift. We quite enjoyed it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game has good graphics and If I was that woman I would creeper out to. I would recommend this game to people who like horror
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Great book for those that are interested in creating a startup. Many stories of hobbies or interests that turned into businesses and how each got started. Book shows you how possible it is for average people to start a business.
B00633PFQC|4.0|Sandel's book provides a key insight into the shift and influence of the Neo-Liberal (total faith in the free market) trend in economics. In his intro he provides a powerful statement into this shift. He states that &#34;we&#34; may be moving from a society that has a market-driven economy to a free-market society. The distinction is very important because the shift means that many aspects of our society (procreation, pollution, education, etc.) that are value-laden are now treated as commodities like soap, cars and pork-bellies.<br />Sandel offers no solutions, but provides key arguments on both sides showing what a slippery slope this trend is. His analysis is excellent in showing the issue underlying each argument, and in doing so, the reader can cut through the brambles of rhetoric and view the issue in clearer terms. His writing is clear and, as mentioned above, he provides no answers, but rather forces the reader to come to their own position given all the &#34;facts.&#34; This is a must read for people to begin to think about important moral decisions in this society and not be swayed by loud-mouthed media &#34;pundits.&#34;
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Love free cell, this is a great app! great game to help relax at any given time of the day
B00AGH5LF6|5.0|I have grown children but found re watching this classic really added to my holiday mood as I wrapped presents and decorated! Having the option to watch when it suited me w Amazon Instant Video was great!<br /><br />Chris Columbus created 2 classic, fun  and iconic holiday movies w the Home Alone movies and I will always have such fond memories...and LOVE the music....Listened to the soundtracks too.
B009X01C64|5.0|This case is durable, and very clean looking.  Easy to always have your kindle with you.  It is a top pick for me.  Trust me, I've tried others, and even more expensive ones.  This is the only case to go with.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great story and action.  Clancy (and his writing sidekick) are in great form.  Couldn't put it down.  The Ryan guys kick butt.
B00846REIS|4.0|This was somewhat similar to fifty shades, but there are a lot if things different. It is an erotica book and there are some very hot things in it.
B00957T6X6|3.0|Bought the first book in the series based on a recommendation of a friend.  After reading half the book I was hooked and purchased the set of five for the Kindle.  At this time I am almost finished the fifth book (this has been a long read but enjoyable) and I realize that there could not possible be a conclusion to this story in the fifth book.  I want to scream - I at least expected a final chapter after a month of reading.  Thus I am giving the series three stars.  Had it had a conclusion I would have given it 5 stars.  At least with a Ken Follett series you know how many books he intends to write in a series to reach a conclusion.  Disappointed is how I feel.  Don't know if I will read any other books in this series.  How long will this be drawn out.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|Good story line but too much unnecessary bloodshed. The outcome was somewhat unrealistic, no one walks away from that many bodies to live happy ever after.
1455523550|5.0|I've always been a sucker for sappy love books. What girl isn't? As Nicholas Sparks movies have been released, I've made it a priority to read the books first. In the past few years I've managed to read A Walk to Remember, The Last Song, The Lucky One, and most recently Safe Haven. I'd have to say Safe Haven is by far the best.<br />  It's full of suspense, an aspect I'm not really used to with any of his other books; but it still manages to keep your heart flowing with all of those lovey dovey feelings. It's books like these that make me impatient to see the movie!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is the perfect game for mobile devices in that you can play for a while, turn it off, and come back later to pick up where you left off.  Cheesy but interesting story, and the hidden object piece is done very well.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This novel captivated me from the  very first sentence. It tells the story of two women whose lives are intertwined even though they  come from very different circumstances. One is an indentured servant and the other is a slave, the daughter of the plantation owner. The thread of the story is compelling, the dialogue authentic. I would recommend this book to any fan of historical fiction.
0395389496|5.0|I am SO glad that I ordered this book! We shared it with our kids and then took them to ride on the &#34;Polar Express&#34; the next day. It was a wonderful treat!
B009UZBLSG|3.0|It's the same exact design as the MHL adapter I had for the Galaxy Nexus, and works similarly.<br /><br />Arrived to my home Christmas eve, hooked it up to TV1, no signal. Two days later, hooked it up to TV2, video! Hurray, played a little bit of Pitfall on my TV2 and worked good, slight jitter once in a while, but nothing major. Unplugged it, plugged into TV1, no video! Must be the HDMI cable, swapped HDMI cable, no video...<br /><br />Plugged back into TV2, no video! Spent 30 minutes plugging and unplugging, got videos every few tries but goes to no video as soon as I move the cables.<br /><br />Went to friend's home and hooked it up to his TV (TV3) no video, via his Nexus4, connected to my Nexus4, same thing<br /><br />Pretty sure it's just a dud, Amazon can't replace it because it's out of stock, going to get a full refund and look into a Miracast adapter instead
B009JBZH54|5.0|Another Xmas present of the year before (2012), very pleased and I got a good price because I pre-ordered it. Thanks for helping me out with my son's impossible requests during Xmas and birthdays.
B000I9U972|5.0|I am a drama teacher and I use this movie every semester. The characters created are so unique, and 8th graders find it funny. I love it--very quirky.
B008MZPUO6|5.0|My son got this CD as a birthday gift in September. He loves it and he is still playing it. It was the right product and as usual right on time.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|This movie is hilarious. I remember seeing it in theaters and could not stop laughing. There are many scenes that will make anyone laugh plus Jennifer Aniston is smokin hot.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love this game I made a glass house!!!! it is really cool I think everyone should try it :)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I bought this for my Kindle as I was running out of things to read, and I thought this might be interesting. It pulled me in from the first book and kept me reading all the way to the end. At the beginning, I didn't think I would like this. It's a sci-fi dystopia-like story, and not usually a genre I read. But the writing is good, the plot is good, and the characters grew on me to the point I found myself rooting for Juliette and for Solo.<br /><br />This was definitely a different type of book for me, and it left me at the end of Wool-5 wanting to find out more about how the people of the silos fared after this book.
B008MEM24S|4.0|A fun use of deductive reasoning. Provides me with an excuse (although it is weak) to play.  Is very addicting.
0143117009|4.0|Professor Diamond has written an even-handed and intelligent introduction to the subject of climate-change and environmentalism for the hitherto uninformed or educated. It was a chore to work through but in the end I found it illuminating and a great jumping off point for further reading and study.<br /><br />The book does an excellent job of jumping across the globe (because of the emphasis on geography I frequently had my globe sitting in front of me) and the societies he chooses to investigate are mostly interesting case studies. The problem with this work is that it is high on repetition, statistics and tedium. The voluminous amounts of data with which he backs up his larger claims are important (in a sense he cannot be faulted because this data is the core to proving his theses), however it made for a laborious read. I think that with more brevity and an emphasis on footnotes much of his data could have been referenced without being displayed. The sheer amount of data, percentages, and figures took away from the flow of the book.<br /><br />In fact, this is the main reason I cannot give the work five stars; Jared Diamond is truly not a great writer. His subject matter is excellent and he covers an impressive range of subjects through the lens of multiple fields of study (geography, history, archeology, agriculture, biology, and more) but unfortunately he is simply boring to read. There is no forward momentum or compelling prose and it is a stilted and awkward work. Also, the title is misleading and it should be stressed that this is a book almost solely focused on the environmental issues (deforestation being number one on that list) that societies have faced and he delves very little into political or military choices made.<br /><br />I would recommend trudging through this work and though portions left me exhausted, his look at Easter Island, Rwanda, Iceland, and especially 'big business' were phenomenal. Highly encouraged for the determined.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|a great play for all those that give it a try. long live applejack and all the other ponies that live in ponyville. keep it up and all those that play shall be rewarded.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|With all the intricate plots, good vs.evil human nature....it was spellbinding.  My granddaughter (age 13) and I had the very BEST holiday school break enjoying it together.  We would have tea, special English cheeses/crackers etc. every day while &#34;stepping back in time&#34;.  We both loved it.  Can't wait until tomorrow night to start Season 3 on the t.v.  We loved the costumes, the humor, the stinging &#34;wit&#34;,  traditions and the locale.  Many years ago my husband and I enjoyed Brideshead Revisited on PBS and eventually I went on a BBC tour enabling me to visit Castle Howard, York, etc.  So Downton Abbey was especially wonderful for me.<br /><br />With all the turmoil in our country today....it was very nice to visit another place, another more genteel time....even when the characters were awful....they were better fodder to watch than all the CNN's, FOX's etc.  A treat!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin dozer is so much fun. I really enjoy playing it. It is super fun. I LOVE IT.  If you get it you should rate it 5 stars
B008OOYALE|5.0|Great!!! I only wish I could get all the other dragons other people have. Its awesome. Really easy and complicated at the same time.
B002WJI65S|5.0|What is cute,detailed,soft,and perfect? A goomba plush! You know,the one you'll probably purchase after you read this description! It is very cute and soft. And hwo dosn't love somthing soft and cute? Also one of the most detailed plush ever. Perfect for playing with. If this description dosn't help read the otherd.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Slow game. Got bored very fast. Deleted off kindle fire. Good thing I didn't waste my money on this game.
B002M89UMW|5.0|I love Judy Garland and this is a great showcase for her. I have it on my Kindle so I watch it whenever I want to, so convenient as I take it everywhere. Meet Me In St Louis is a great look at early 20th century life when the father is the &#34;ruler&#34; of the house, even though mother makes all the decisions, and the daughters are growing up in such restrictive times. But the love of the family shows through. And the music is absolutely wonderful.
B0043RSK3K|3.0|Well, this is no scholarly piece of work, though I did not expect much from a guy who made &#34;JFK&#34;.  This is a Cliff's Notes kind of history  that is long on bald assertions but short on supporting factual references.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|My 12  year old brought home the maze runner and got both me and my wife to read it. Fun action packed series, that should appeal to fans of the Hunger Games.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|WOW!!!! When I first rented this movie ... I wasn't sure I (or the kids) would even like it enough to watch the whole thing. BOY WAS I WRONG! I love (and the kind) loved the movie so much we had to buy it. What a great modern twist to Christmas stories. I highly recomend \\"Arthur's Christmas\\" for everyone.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I gave his product 5 stars for the simple fact that themovies blow me away. To be honest, I was a little disappointed with the special features. Nothing new or exclusive to the blu-ray set, but so what. The story is so good and te filmmaking is wonderful. I'm not a comic book guy nor was I even a Batman guy before these films, but I am now. These films meet all my criteria for a great movie: Good story, I care about the characters, limited CGI, and it's not in 3D.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|Loved this movie, really loved the first one, so this was a no brainer. Although they changed it up a bit... still worked and with the added bonus of Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale...a definite must see.
034544678X|5.0|Have a dog? Want a dog? Know a dog? This is a must! Read it - then read it again. Grab your highlighter and soak it up - Patricia McConnell's work is incredible, easy to read and if you can apply a brain cell or two it can really make your canine relationship awesome.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This is an awesome game for all ages. If you haven`t tried it donwload it today. The best part is it is free
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is defiantly worth watching. Especially if u start from the beginning. I will rent the rest of the series and more!
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I ben reading many Book's .I love Vampire book's My friend gave me two from Kerrelyn Sparks I look in to Amazon and found more<br />from Keerelyn Sparks they all belong to the Vampire series.My other friend got me fife more from Amazon for Christmas.<br />Now I have eight I think the are tree more in the series I will get them to<br />The stories are so good you can't stop reading I love the way she wright's, Keerelyn Sparks is  good.<br />Thank you Luise Stipka
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was an excellent price for three good blu ray movies.  I would recommend this purchase to a friend .
B009JBZH54|5.0|I forget how good the first movie was...all of them deliver and entertain.  Makes me long for the \\"next\\" Batman and excited for Man of Steel.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I could easily use this as an alternative to &quot;tune in radio pro&quot;, it's actually more complete as it has presets and it's own volume rocker that overrides the phone's one. It comes with 3 visual themes and also a lot of customization through the settings. Thanks Amazon, great FAOTD choice!
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My granddaughter built her house right away and played with this Lego set for a couple hours til she had to go home.  Her brother received a Lego set also and they played together the whole time with no fights, threats or whining!  Love it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game. I don't like the add right before every game. I end up clicking on it cause I forget it pops up and it won't go away unless I click home&nbsp;and&nbsp;reopen the app.
034580404X|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time. Just enuf of everything to where u can't take your eyes off it.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Th<br /><br />This author is one of my favorites.  I'll read anything by him.<br /><br />The story has a great grab by having the point of view be a young  boy.  I like the way he figures things out.  Ialso llike the way he feels bout and handles the choices of right and wrong and the gray space between the two.<br /><br />:
B009E3EXMU|5.0|The greatest band ever , they never disappoint, completely dominant in every way. Been a fan since 1974. Video sounds great.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|This Book is actually not 5 or 4 stars it is 1 stars it is not very good it's bad!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have to say I took a chance on this book since I only knew of the author's work through movies.  I didn't want to read a book of his that already had a movie tied to it either. I first read this book in January 2011, two years ago and I plan on rereading it again prior to the movie release this February.<br /><br />This book is a story about a woman who finds love in a not so simple circumstance.  She's always looking behind without really being able to let her guard down and allowing love fully in. The reason is because she has left someone behind in her old town prior to fleeing to Southport, NC. Her past soon then catches up with her and she must face what awaits her since it not only affects her but the ones she loves.<br /><br />It is a meaningful story that will touch everyone in some kind of way.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|After reading this book you have to stop and realize how lucky we are to be able to get up every day and  do things we want to do with no hesitation, thanks to the military personnel that watches over us. A must read book about the courageous people out there like Adam Brown.
0062103377|5.0|I am a huge fan of Supernatural and I loved getting the opportunity to delve into the life of Bobby.
B00008EY7H|5.0|i saw this live in my  &#34;home&#34; theater and LOVED it, I just had to get it on movie to share with the family.. LOVED it too!! Can't stop singing the song &#34;alegria&#34; because it was sung so beautifully here~~~
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have this program on my phone and my Kindle Fire HD. I love this game! It is a great way to pass the time while waiting for my kids activities to be over.

B005LAIH4A|5.0|The kids enjoyed getting this at Christmas..They saw it in the theater and LOVED it. It arrived on time and was a great deal
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I think it was one of her better books. I did not want to turn it off.  The first time I used my Kindle
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Modern Family is our family favorite show....we have the complete season and ordered a second set as a gift to relatives.  If you haven't seen this show, you should!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was awesome! I was enthralled from the beginning. Loved the characters... I was totally invested in it. Totally Worth the read!
1609611543|5.0|After watching Dr. Davis on a show I started to read his blog and had to get the book. Super informative. Started what I call healthy eating. It's more than a diet. It's life changing.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I downloaded this app for the ability to have a camera and take still photos and videos using my kindle fire hd.  It appears that this app does far more but so far have not delved into its capabilities
B000P12LWY|5.0|My friend loved this as her christmas present. As far as I know, it works perfectly and she is very satisfied.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking to have a basic calculator app and this one fits the bill.  I didn't need a lot of functions that some other calculators offer, just a simple calculator.  I would recommend this to anyone needing the same.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|So excited to finally have this movie. It came in great condition, and there are no scratches. It is perfect.
006029129X|5.0|I remembered enjoying this book when I was a very young girl and thought my 5 and 2 year old grandson's would also enjoy it.  So far, it is the two year old who has been requesting this book more frequently.
B00007GZR5|5.0|This is a movie you need to watch stright threw without interruption, but well worth it. It will make you cry, it will make you smile, it will male you think. I love this movie
B005LAIHZY|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, but just heard the hype so far, you will not be disappointed.  That was me last year until I saw it for the first time after a friend loaned me hers.  My daughters are 3 and 1, my step daughter is almost 18, and my husband is almost 38, and we all love it!  My 3 year old has discovered the princess world and I was not overly excited about the negative stereotypes surrounding Disney 'beauty' and the role of a girl as a princess.  Disney impressed me with this movie and not just because of the graphics and soundtrack (we have downloaded several MP3's, the music is absolutely beautiful) but because they finally created a strong female character that denounces marriage to choose her own path and the family dynamics are quality and heartfelt.  As a mom, I cried.  It's a story mainly about a mother and a daughter and it's amazing.  We laugh every time because the humor is funny and age appropriate but still makes us adults laugh as well.  I never object when they request this move (we have one in the car and the other in the house DVD player) because I enjoy it just as much.  This particular one was a great price and it comes with both a regular DVD and a blu-ray disc.  Definitely recommend this :)
B000MV8XPG|5.0|My 3 yr old grandson, Brayden LOVES it!  Does take time to assemble. Only suggestion are assembly instructions in English!
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|I am so tired of the top 40 drivel.  Caught this band on a late night talk show and the lead singer knocked my socks off with his delivery.  I saw glimpses of the 60's in their costume and felt tons of rock and soul in their performance.  I felt like I was privy to something in the beginning stages of historical greatness.  I hear they are going to be touring with The Who.  I would love to see them live.  My hubby immediately ordered this album from Amazon at the end of their TV performance.  He is a huge music fan, from waaaay back and he knows a great band when he hears one.  Watch these guys explode into fame and fortune.  They give me hope for music again.  Hallelujah!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart is in great voice ,we love this cd,it is perfect for our Christmas collection ,along side Doris day, Dean Martin , Perry Como, along with other great singers.
B00A4YVHXQ|2.0|It was fun when it was working the first day or two. Then the app's sound just stopped working. I tried a few adjustments and finally gave up and uninstalled it.
B00001OH1S|5.0|One of the things that I loved about this movie was the music . The cd is just great  and I listen to all the time.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This version may play a little loosely with Dickens' original, but it is delightful just the same.  You just can't beat Kermit and Piggy for fine acting.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love the show and enjoy watched repeats when nothing of interest on TV. Was in good condition, when arrived.
0393088774|5.0|I recommend this without reservation for anyone who wants to understand the current economic mess facing us.  Concise, direct language conveys a thorough treatment.  Not recommended, however, for close-minded ideological far-right loonies.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is good. There's a little mystery, scandal, and a lot of crazy. Just when u think u have it all down there is something else! Definite reader! My only wish is there is a number 2 in the works.
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|The trilogy that I purchased stated that it was \\"Dubbed\\" in english, in fact it is sub titled. The story is great though.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Don't know why this is so highly rated. Yeah, the child actors did great but Bruce Willis and Ed Norton?  Weird, disturbed characters that added nothing to their previously stellar resumes.  I'm sick of &#34;sweet stories of teenage angst and love&#34; that make it ok to run away from home and engage in pubescent intimacy and authorize adultry. Academy Award potential? You've got to be kidding!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This was a good story.  It is different which is why I liked it.  The plot developed well and the twist and turns kept me entertained.  Great Entertainment.
1423140605|5.0|All his books in his series are great my daughter can't wait for the next one to come out. Good Authour
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I was hesitant to rent this movie due to the reviews it received from some viewers.  I thought it was a good movie, It revives the Bourne trilogy and sets up the next sequel.  The Action was good, stuff gets blown up, the guy gets the hot girl and the world is saved again!
0553212761|4.0|Can be very funny when read right.  Quirky and interesting characters and plot points.  All of Jane Austen's books are worth reading.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|The world of the future is shown in great detail.  I dont think the movie tells the back story of the Federation too well.  IT just sorta leaves you to assume who the bad guys and the good guys are.  Now the Action was non-stop and I never expected what was going to happen next.  The story progressed well and was entertaining.
0451187903|4.0|A very sweet love story for each of the two older sisters.  Lots of ups and downs and twists and turns.  Can sometimes be a slow read, but worth it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|All of the reviewers who said that they couldn't put it down were absolutely correct. I bought it as a vacation read and I couldn't stop reading it. I completely connected with the characters and the story line and thought it was amazing. Highly reccomend
0451523067|5.0|Emma is a well-intending matchmaker who makes more chaos in her life.  Constant movement and an enjoyable love story that ends happily.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game increases problem solving and memory skills. Good for anyone who wants to improve the brain pathways and exercise their synapes.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|Four stars for a plot that keeps things moving!  A good movie for an evening to prop up your feet and to dine on buttered popcornl.
B007TK77QE|5.0|The characters in this book were really well developed, to such an extent you really felt you were prying into their deeply hidden thoughts.  Apart from this, the book really shows a huge range of human emotion and that not only is all politics local, in the modern world, all politics is personal.  A fantastic book
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Who knew you could have so much fun with sticks...I would have paid twice as much for this app seriously
B0010E1SGU|5.0|i have read this book so many times through out the years but cannot seem to get enough of it...i lost the one i had for years and just had to have another
B007SPPANM|5.0|No scratches!<br />Cant wait to watch it<br />Plays perfectly<br />Good classic movie<br />I love Leonardo Dicaprio<br />Thank you so much
B002W7J3SO|5.0|This is my husbands favorite movie. It was for his Christmas gift. He loved it and we all enjoyed watching it again.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very well thought out.  I've enjoyed this game very much, hours of game play.  Would recommend this game, well worth the bucks.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My son loves all these games. He plays them on my phone and on my Kindle fire. So does my granddaughter.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A very funny book that many middle schoolers can relate to. I would definitely recommend this book to others looking for a good, humorous book
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|He drove me crazy till I let him download it to my Kindle Fire. He has my pad more then I do.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|First person shooter I've ever played with great action in campaign and easy no shoot kills in multiplayer and the best modern combat yet
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|He did not like the game so he deleted . he said it was no fun it you have to keep buying things with real money.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am sorry that I spent good money on this smutty book, Book Two isn't much better. Reading book Three now. Only reason I continued is because I spent over $30 for the three books.<br />I think they are trashy and I will not buy this E.L. James books again.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|My son and I both love this games. I win all of the first Mahjong so I had to try the deluxe which is harder.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Smut at its best. I thought these books were supposed to help couples improve their sex life, but it's nothing we want to try!
B008MEM24S|5.0|My son has beat it 100% but loves to go back and play over and over. My granddaughter loves to play it too.
0446554995|4.0|There are some books I struggle to finish because the premise is so outlandish that my 'yea right,' radar goes off on every page and I can't find the stories believable. With Preston and Child, however, they can write a book and have the most outlandish premise but I gobble up each page in anticipation of what comes next. I thoroughly enjoy their work. They provide great atmosphere, evil characters, wonderful heroes and a wee bit of stretchy plots, but I always smile when I see a new Pendergast novel.<br /><br />Two Graves explores Helen's past and we meet the people who wanted her dead. I had thought the series had faultered with all the Helen and Pendergast drama, but this book sums it all up and puts to rest the marriage with all of its complications, implications and secrets. For me, the last book, Cold Vengeance, and this one came together and explained the mystery surrounding Helen and ties it up. There are several new twists which are very surprising and makes this reader want to delve into the next novel with high anticipation.<br /><br />Two Graves starts off interestingly with a series of bizarre murders in New York where the killer allows himself to be video taped walking around in the hotels where he commits his atrocious acts. Pendergast is wallowing in self pity as his beloved Helen has again been kidnapped and he feels he is at fault. Vincent's crime report of the bizarre killings causes Pendergast to snap out of his slump and get to work.<br /><br />There are some minor plots that involve other characters (an especially good one involving Constance Green) in the series but the main story has Pendergast out to seek revenge against a familiar evil and in turn, he comes face to face with  rather bizarre revelations in the process.<br /><br />This is a book fans will eat up. The 'yea right' factor may rear its head but with the deft hands of Preston and Child it will be ran over and riddled with bullets before you can turn the page to find out what happens next.ns next.
B008OOYALE|3.0|He liked it till I had to get a new Kindle Fire and had to start over. He said it was to much trouble.
B0086700CM|3.0|i found this game was far to advanced for my three year old grandson and all you seem to do is run around things.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son loves these games. He is always playing it on my Kindle Fire or on my phone. I keep telling him to quit taking to the game or I will delete it!
B0063IH60K|2.0|although i liked the solitarie game and layout, i did not like the dateing advertisements that would pop up from time to time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  A GREAT plot twist that I never saw coming. The characters are hard to figure out.  Fascinating.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was incredibly inspiring and had lessons that I'll carry with me for a long time. I'm absolutely amazed by it.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Mindless and simple. A good way to waste time, if you are in need of such a thing. Personally, I don't see what all the fuss is about. But if you're one of those people who doesn't have  real life, this is a good way to get through then day.
0071762345|5.0|I commend Dave Kerpen on his rock-solid decisions concerning how to present the wealth of information, insights, and counsel found in his book. For example, the title of each of the 18 chapters serves multiple purpose: as an admonition, as a core principle, as an especially important issue, and/or as an affirmation. They comprise both a multi-dimensional challenge by Kerpen to his reader, and, as the values and strategies for his manifesto of advocacy. For example, consider the titles for the first five chapters:<br /><br />1. Listen First, and Never Stop Listening<br />2. Way Beyond \\"Women 25-54\\": Define Your Target Audience Better Than Ever<br />3. Think -- and Act -- Like Your Customer<br />4. Invite Your Customers to Be Your First Fans<br />5. Engage: Create True Dialogue with, and Between, Your Customers<br /><br />Kerpen immediately establishes and then sustains a direct, personal rapport with his reader and thus serves as a role model for his articles of faith and pragmatic street smarts. As is seldom true of other business books I have read, I felt that he wrote this book specifically for me and presumably many others will have the same sense of collegiality. He thoroughly covers the WHAT of achieving and then sustaining success with social media but most of his and his reader's attention is devoted to the HOW.<br /><br />With regard to the meaning and significance of the book's title, Kerpen observes, \\"In the end, succeeding on social networks amounts to your ability to be likeable. There are two fundamental aspects to this term: likeable business practices and likeable content.\\" I wholly agree with him as do millions of others who have been involved in major consumer research studies conducted by firms that include Gallop, Nielsen, and Consumer Reports. They indicate that feeling appreciated and \\"easy to do business\\" are among attributes of greatest importance to them. Also keep in mind that most of the companies annually ranked \\"most highly admired\\" and \\"best to work for\\" are also ranked among those that are most profitable and have the greatest cap value in their industry. Coincidence? I don't think so.best to work for\\" are also ranked among those that are most profitable and have the greatest cap value in their industry. Coincidence? I don't think so.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I was really surprised by the power and drama this movie exuded. The use of many of the snow White themes, i.e.; the Dwarfs, the Apple, the Kiss, etc were skillfully added to the over riding theme of the Queens' need to devour the purity of heart, mind and soul. This is a keeper, and one I'll watch many times in the fuure, but not one I'd let small children see.
B008Y5OW20|3.0|I like the song selection and a couple come over well but overall, it can only be described as average interpretations, not inspired ones.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Graphics sound are good on the moto photon.  It is easy to pickup and play for 5 minutes or 20 minutes to get your mind off something it probably should be on.
B008OJ291W|4.0|Some of the work is really good. Some is just ok. The drumming leaves a bit to be desired. If your football team drops to the bottom of the league, you still follow them. The two albums are not &#34;at the top of their game&#34; but I would still listen to anything Jeff puts his name to.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Very happy that I found a free app that I can use and manage my documents on the go. Plus it's so easy to use!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|It is the  best love story I have read in a long time. I like the rawness, the emotion, the depth of love that pours from the pages. Normally I am annoyed by people who fall in love and want to get married suddenly. This makes me want to believing love again. It makes me believe you can love someone and have them love you flaws and all.

B008UG0JJI|4.0|The video is somewhat below my expectations. Hiromi's powerful stile is still their, but the rhythm group is not. There is so much one can do alone. Beethoven's arrangement is probably the highest point of this recording, with the rest being largely indistinguishable and broadly flat. The main problem is that Hiromi is by herself and can not get neither inspiration nor real support from the rest of the trio. My suggestion for the next round would be to pair with younger and more vital guys, and through in a bit more diversity in the music itself.<br />Yes, and please do not forget the keyboard, which squarely sits on top of your grand piano but is rarely used. We still need some synthetic sounds coming from your ardent heart through a pair highly capable hands.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its not to complicated but it is some what challenging to the mind and it is so much fun when you are bored
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I read this book on a recommendation from my eldest son who is an engineer.  It was most informative on a personal and business level.  He was obviously a visionary man whose quest for excellence is one I wish I education system would instill in the pupils attending South African schools.<br /><br />I use Apple products because of the simplicity and purity of design, so I enjoyed his quest for that.  If only more business leaders had the courage to cut out mediocrity.  He really was a leader and the book brought that home very clearly and gave insight into his personality and thought processes.  After reading the book I have also realized that most people do not like absolute honesty thus Steve was disliked by many for calling a spade a spade.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to young men and women wanting to go into business and anyone interested in how great people think and create.  What a pity he died so young.<br /><br />Enjoyment in reading<br />Elaine Nelson
0345803485|1.0|Agreeing with the negative reviews regarding poor writing, missing of a plot, and endless repetition of phrases, I would like to add a few thoughts.<br />Besides that sex has been reduced to bestiality, the 'leitmotif'  in the story is the dysfunction of the people described.<br />In the long run we all strive for Love. Sex without love will not be sustained. It requires equitable rights of pleasure. If anyone is led to believe that sex can just be reduced to mechanics, they are led astray.  Sexual enjoyment depends on skills begotten through many aspects of a relationship, among which are sensitivity and consideration for the other person, leading to refinement.<br />I am sorry to say that this book is cheap, has no value and belongs in the trash can.<br /><br />Who was the editor?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is my favorit game! It is super fun! It is a really addicting game. I LOVE Subway Suffers!

B0085RQLXK|5.0|Aerosmith's long awaited new album has been unleashed, and whoever wrote these guys off saying they \\"weren't good for another record\\" was dead wrong! With ROCKIN' tracks likes \\"Legendary Child\\", \\"Out Go The Lights\\" and \\"Lover Alot\\", they should have been nomintaed for Best New Album at the Grammys - these guys deserve it! No filler here - just pure old school kick butt ROCK AND ROLL, the way it should be!! AEROSMITH ROCKS!! LONG LIVE THE KINGS!!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I don't listen country music but since watching the show I totally fell in love with the characters and the music.  Glad the CD came out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a fresh, colorful, and fun game. Extremely addicting. Some people might say it's a rip off of temple run. True, it's like temple run, but in my opinion it's more fun. Subway surfers is a game I recommended to a friend, and she said it was awesome. I really think that if you're looking for a fun game to play, you should play subway surfers. If it resets...well that hasn't happened to me yet but if it does I probably wouldn't mind because subway surfers is that fun. Give it a try!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|When you get the mouse the packaging looks much the same as you'd expect from a \\"gaming\\" mouse. It's in a standard box with a cool design on the cover and the rest of the packaging is nothing extraordinary. Where the real interest begins is after you open it up.<br /><br />You'll receive a grey plastic case full of what look like the batteries you put in hearing aids. These are actually weights. If you take the mouse out of it's plastic protective casing on the underside you'll find a unlockable compartment where you can insert the weights according to your preference. At first unpackaging the mouse is very light, and it helps to add all the weights in for a more standard feel. Seal it back up when you've reached your desired weight.<br /><br />Unravel the nylon like cord that connects the mouse to the computer via a standard USB cable. The instruction booklet you should have received in the packaging indicates you'll receive driver and installation software via email, however if you ordered from Amazon you won't receive such (this reviewer didn't at least) and you'll have to go to [...] and download the appropriate driver and software.<br /><br />It is in this software that you find your ability to set preferences such as mouse speed, color, quick key and other settings.<br /><br />While the mouse feels light and cheap it's general makeup concerning preference specifications and response time is very good. It takes some time to adjust to faster response times than a standard mouse but once that is knocked out of the way this mouse will serve your needs very well.<br /><br />A downside to this specific mouse is that for all it's customization options you cannot change it's user capabilities. Meaning if you're a lefty and in need of a mouse for lefties you're out of luck. Likewise you cannot customize the size for your palm making this potentially unenjoyable for use by those with smaller hands.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|In 2089, the Weyland corporation sponsors archaeologists, including Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), who discover celestial maps on ancient walls in Scottish caves that match those in other ancient ruins around the world. Following these maps, an advanced spaceship called \\"Prometheus\\" travels across galaxies in a four-year span to reach a distant moon that matches the ancient maps. Among the crew of this ship is an all-purpose android named David (Michael Fassbender) whose intellect is nearly perfect and has immense capabilities and perhaps a growing sense of self. There is also a sage but salty captain, Janek (Idris Alba), a naively friendly biologist (Rafe Spall), a grumpy geologist (Sean Harris) and a corporate micro-manager, Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). The exact mission of Prometheus is unknown as the initial thesis behind these suspected maps, that they were extraterrestrials who visited Earth thousands of years ago, may be the starting point of surprising and horrifying truths. To make things even more mysterious, we occasionally see hologram messages of the late, enigmatic Mr. Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) himself. What exactly is on the mysterious moon and why did the Weyland Corporation spend trillions on this voyage? Where will the search for the truth lead them?<br /><br />Prometheus is a semi-prequel and sidequel to its director's, Ridley Scott, 1979 film Alien. The film is very well-paced and it hooked me from the start. Scott still has his directing magic and the editing and cinematography are top-notch. Despite the alien moon being a gloomy and creepy place, the gray, purple and desert landscapes and skys are gorgeous. Like the original film Alien, the special effects, set pieces, costumes and props are imaginative and an interesting blend of modernism and futurism. Fear not, the unique, influencing styles of H.R. Giger are still to be found throughout the film. While the film was excellent in many technical ways, I was very disappointed by much of the story and some of the acting.<br /><br />Prometheus is a film Scott has tried to create for years and production began in 2009. Jon Spaihts developed an outline and rough draft of the script. Spaihts leaked script shows a much more explained and nuanced story as well as character development then the final product. Co-writer Damon Lindelof might be the reason behind the perplexing elements of the film. For instance, the protagonist Elizabeth Shaw was a well written, interesting character who was smart, strong and curious but she orders the crew to do something monumentally stupid shortly after Prometheus lands on the moon. In fact, there are a lot of horror film cliches where people (educated professional people, in this case) do things so ridiculously dumb even a sea sponge would know not to do. This is just poor writing.<br /><br />Still, this was a very good film with some memorable highlights. An unforgettable sequence unfolds at about seventy-three minutes into the film involving striking holograms; it is something like a gorgeously alien planetarium. I also enjoyed the authentic usage of Proto-Indo-European in the film; a nice touch by Scott and the other filmmakers in getting the details right rather than using gibberish or linguistic unobtainium. Michael Fassbender is given a very interesting role as an android who looks just like a man and mimics the feelings and expressions of people perfectly. Like a replicant, he has a fascinating emotional state as his mimicry might at some point in the journey have developed into an actual ego. Fassbender's performance is impeccable here. Rapace, Pearce, Alba and Theron all do well in their roles but the clear weak link is Logan Marshall-Green. His performance is closer to a drunken fratboy whose matriculation was due to his father being the dean than an actual archeaologist. Denise Richards was far more convincing as nuclear scientist Dr. Christmas Jones in The World IsNot Enough than Marshall-Green was here. That is saying a lot. For those who enjoyed the horror of the Aliens series, there are some very intense and squeamish scenes. Those who are a bit sensitive to body horror and gore might want to close their eyes during some scenes in Prometheus.<br /><br />I do not see the problem with the open-ended and unanswered questions in Prometheus. The film was designed to be the first in a trilogy, and great science fiction and pensive fictions require such questions to ask of its audience. The overall experience of Prometheus is dreamy, nearly surreal, with the great mysteries touched upon but only superficially addressed. This film fall far short of the truly great and cerebral, philosophical science fiction films such as Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Oydessy and Metropolis. Prometheus was entertaining and, at times, horrifying and scary. I appreciate the fact that Prometheus provided some amazing sights and entertaining mysteries, and it loosely had some heavy themes but it could have been a lot better without the plotholes. The sights and sounds of the film wowed me, but the story's flaws are unfortunately present.Not Enough than Marshall-Green was here. That is saying a lot.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|man,  i thought i was struggling with the angry birds, the pigs really make you work.  still love it, great to pass the time with.
B005NQ94KS|4.0|I see the reviews are mixed on this one, and I am not sure mine will help. I like the movie okay, and it definitely was different from the usual. I don't mind Anne Hathaway's accent, as many films have employed an actor or actress to play a character beyond their roots. Her character was very likeable, and I pretty much figured out what would happen. But that is okay with me. I did not expect it to be a blockbuster. It was comfortable to watch, and that alone says a lot about a movie made within the past three decades.<br />I have to give it at least four stars for keeping me interested, and the music.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|i could handle this type of bingo.  others i have tried have too much going on. i prefer simple bingo game.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Excellent read . . . through Cheryl's words I shared her loss of marriage, family and most especially the loss of her mother.  She writes vividly allowing to hike the PTC along side her step by step!  I cheered at each of her successes along the trails; whether they be emotional or overcoming fallen logs; she writes as we are partners on the trail and &#34;just&#34; sharing our thoughts.
B008OTTX6G|5.0|Bought this for a friend and my father and they both loved the album.  So glad I bought this for them.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Excellent casting, acting and what an intriguing storyline for both the rich and working class!  Thorough enjoyable, only problem is that once you get started watching, a whole weekend will go by so you can finish the season.  We watched it a 2nd time and enjoyed as much while waiting for Season 3 to come out in a few weeks.  Thanks BBC for a great show!
B00005QB42|3.0|Deva Premal is one of my favorites. While this CD is okay, it is too repetitious of two other of her CD's. I should have paid more attention to the songs lusted.

B003G94BZC|5.0|This is a must have for any Doctor fan.  It pure entertainment great going through the best doctors stories.  Finding the Doctor's flashlight as a bonus gift was, well, quite a bonus.  Price is also great -- was MUCH more expensive on other sites.  Thanks, Amazon!

B006X4VVFU|5.0|This turned out to  be a duplicate of an episode that is already on the end of the 1st season set, so you really do not have to buy it separately like I did and open it before I knew it was already on the Season 1 that I just bought, too.  --ratz--  BUT, it is an excellent episode and must see before watching Season 2.  Best casting and storyline I have seen in a long time -- thanks to BBC, who really has the highest in quality entertainment lately.  The U.S. could learn something here...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put it down the moment I started reading it!!! I laughed & I cried. AMAZING BOOK!!! Highly recommend it!

B00005LOUQ|5.0|I decided to order this movie after it was on the tv and we accidently only recorded half of it. My son wanted badly to see the ending and so I ordered it for him. It arrived two days early and in good condition. The only thing that worried me is that it was packed in a simple bubble envelope so if it was banged around any in shipping it could have been damaged. However this was not the case and when it got here it was in great shape.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Brilliant portrayal of a mans life spinning out of control, crashing and burning just like the jetliner he saves from almost certain doom.  Now that he's done the impossible - saving the lives of over 100 people - he must pick up the pieces of his own life and save it before it's too late. The plane crash and investigation surrounding it are merely obvious metaphors for his own turmoil (drug and alcohol abuse, a broken marriage, a life of missed opportunities) and Zemekis has woven these two elements together and brings them to stunning and heartbreaking conclusion and Denzel Washington (my choice for best actor of 2012)  will reduce you to tears. Here's a recent documentary that a produced about a real plane crash that happened in 1978.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Return-Dwight-And-Nile-Flight/dp/B0044T27SQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1357392949&sr=8-2&keywords=return+to+dwight+and+nile+the+crash+of+psa+flight+182

B009RI4FRU|3.0|quite entertaining though the camera work and slow scene progression required a little more work than I like when I watch what I thought would be a light entertaining movie, still worth watching though, maybe watching it a second time would permit me to appreciate the producer's intentions better

B0054TVW04|4.0|In a nice contrast with the book by Jared Diamond, Ferguson brings the discussion of West dominance to a higher level. The author presents a good discussion on why institutions, cultural and religion aspects were the driving forces for that dominance. An easy and pleasant reading well worth the money.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I love these headphones, so far been very pleased. I was using X12's and I liked them as well. Getting the chat audio setup is a little time consuming. The only thing I can say I'm not impressed with is the bass boost feature, I can not really discern any real difference in the audio with it on or off.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love this book.  It really pulls you in and makes you want to know the story.  Such a cute and funny story.
B008Y5OWMK|1.0|I chose this rating because I can't view the DVD.  It is the wrong region for OZ.<br />My fault, as I should have checked beforehand instead of wasting my money.<br /><br />To my critics, I can only agree with you.<br /><br />However I now have a region free Blu ray player and have been able to view the movie.<br /><br />I have to say I found the movie excellent and have to wonder about the highly negative reviews when it was first released.  It may well have been that at that time (early 80s) that the critics were looking for something else.<br /><br />I was thoroughly absorbed in the film.<br /><br />My only criticism was that I found it hard to understand the audio.  So much so that I watched it again with subtitles on.  All that did was highlight that it didn't matter that I coudn't hear the audo because in reality it was inconsequential.<br /><br />But overall I found it to be a great movie.

B006GKHE6G|4.0|this game is pretty cool. the only thing i don't like about it is that when it comes to the championship it starts to cheat. like they start you off in last place then it takes you forever to get in 1st, 2nd, or even 4th place. and before you know it you've lost. and that's when the mean in me starts to show. i just hope for their sake that once they keep getting bad reviews that they'll finally change something about that championship thing.
0141195851|5.0|This is the only book of Charles Dickens' I liked and was able to read the entire way through. I'd recommend renting a library copy to read first, if you've never read the story. If you've read the story, are a lover of books, or like something pretty on your bookshelf, this is a great buy. The cover has a nice feel to it, almost like a canvas, and the snowflakes are dark navy colored. The inside covers are the same navy, as is the cloth bookmark. The book itself does have illustrations throughout, a nice sized font, and tons of footnotes, if you care to read them (which I do).<br />The layout is as follows; a Dickens chronology, introduction (cultural significance of story, context, Dickens' thoughts on Christmas, etc), Christmas Festivities (thoughts and observations), The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton (an imaginative story of a mean undertaker and the goblins who teach him a lesson), A Christmas Episode from Master Humphrey's Clock (a single man who befriends a deaf man in a tavern), A Christmas Carol, The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain, A Christmas Tree, What Christmas Is, As We Grow Older, The Seven Poor Travellers, appendices, and footnotes. So far, I've read up to A Christmas Carol (in the last chapter), and it is a great collection of stories so far. I love the contents, the way it looks, and I'm very satisfied with the purchase to the point that I want to buy more Penguin Classic cloth hardcover books.

0307352145|2.0|I thought this would be a straight forward book on how introverts could excel in an extrovert world.  It drags in several areas, and I never saw the &#34;formula&#34; for mastering the outside world.  It had several examples, but very few specifics (if it had them, I didn't recognize them) on how they excelled or moved to the &#34;head of the class.&#34;  I was looking for a more detailed analysis and got a broad brush instead.  I gave the book to Good Will.
