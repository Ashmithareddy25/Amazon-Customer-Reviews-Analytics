B005V2S7FW|5.0|A computer tech was recently at my home installing some hardware. I had to leave the room to take a phone call.  When I returned, he was trying to log on to my computer.  I told him to keep trying.  After about 20 minutes he gave up because he could not get in to my Lastpass.  He is not the NSA, but he was unable to access my passwords.
B005DESVPO|5.0|This album is a great intro into GC Jr.  It's short, it's an EP...but it's also very cheap.  Get it.
B00E9E4EC8|3.0|If you're an Alan Jackson fan, this album is great, or so his fans tell me. If you're a bluegrass fan, the album is average at best. Nothing wrong with the instrumentals, they're very good. Jackson treats a song beautifully and does so on this album. My problem is that its just another slick, formula driven Nashville production. Bluegrass is traditionally a team effort, with no one individual totally in the spotlight, this album features Jackson rather than the music and the team effort. You could hear the whole Nashville formula: we have &#34;the star&#34;, rendering all the others to back-up status, and who ever heard to backup singers in bluegrass? Its a team effort. Of course the song mix had some old and new, throwing in some religious references about every third song, framed like the hundreds of other cookie cutter albums Nashville cranks out every year. If you're a big Alan Jackson fan, buy it. If you're a bluegrass fan, you can do better. This is stereotype country music with slightly different instrumentation.

That&quot;s when I discovered that after a couple.of failed tries I either have to pay to continue or wait 30 minutes or get a facebook friend to give me a life. The problem is they got frustrated and quit playing also.  I don't. see why some people get hooked on this.
1881273377|5.0|My girlfriend and I listened to these CDs together.  Mr. Chapman provides an excellent insight into how different people communicate their love.  He explains how people can be speaking different langues (speaking Chinese to someone who only speaks Spanish) and how one person may think he or she is communicating love to a partner, yet the partner doesn't understand that &#34;language&#34; of love.  I highly recommend a listen.

0785165975|3.0|Title: Hit-Girl (HC)<br />Publisher: Marvel<br />Writer: Mark Millar<br />Artists: John Romita Jr. (pencils), Tom Palmer (inks), Dean White (colors)<br />Collects: Hit-Girl #1-5<br />Price: $24.99<br /><br />If you've read the book Kick-Ass, then you are already very familiar with the title character of this book. This book is set between the books [[ASIN:0785132619 Kick-Ass]] and [[ASIN:0785152466 Kick-Ass 2]]. Like those books (and most everything else that Mark Millar has written), the story is filled with all sorts of over-the-top violence. Once again, Mindy McCready takes down crowds of Mafioso, street punks, drug dealers and the like with guns, swords, knives, sledgehammers, garrotes, and assorted other weapons. There really isn't a lot new, here. About the only thing different between this book and Kick-Ass is that Mindy is the central character rather than Dave Lizewski (aka Kick-Ass).<br /><br />Rather than seeing Dave's adolescent struggles in high school, we get to see a few of Mindy's struggles as she tries to do something she's never done before: go to school and be a \\"normal\\" girl. She has a hard time fitting in with other girls, and the girls in the story are extraordinarily mean and exaggerated in their behavior.<br /><br />If you liked Kick-Ass, you'll probably like this as well. The story is more of the same. The artwork is identical to that book's artwork, and it's all set in the same universe with the same characters. You even get to see Red Mist on his tour of the Far East, trying to learn to be a real super hero. (These particular scenes offer some of the only comedic moments of the book.)<br /><br />This book really didn't grab me. Millar outright tries to offend people, it seems, and he succeeds. This book isn't for me. If I want to see violent vigilante justice in a comic book, I'd much rather be reading Punisher.<br /><br />Writing: 5/10<br />Artwork: 7/10<br />Cool Factor: 6/10<br />Value: 6/10<br /><br />Overall: 6/10
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|.To is a really cute game this time of year. It is addicting. It gets harder and trickier as you advance.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|As anyone can see from the other reviews, people are upset. Most are mad with the ending, and I understand that. But what really frustrated me with the novel was the fact that it does not fit with the other two. The first and second parts are fantastic and are hard to put down! Allegiant, however, lacks the magic for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First, there are two different point of views. Usually when an author does this, it allows the reader even greater insight to BOTH characters, but in this case, it only was used in order to continue the book when one of them dies. It does get confusing as to who is talking in each chapter and the characters do not grow. We learn little about each that we didn't know before.<br /><br />Secondly, the plot was slow. They immediately enter the potential plot in the beginning (no spoilers, I promise), but then that's it. Nothing truly happens that is significant. Life goes on, and it feels like \\"blah, blah, blah\\". Everything that happens is not significant. In addition, I feel like the character's reactions are not that realistic. If I was in their position and found out what they did, I'd be freaking out. They just are like, \\"oh, ok.\\" Who does that? You would never expect that from these characters, especially after the events of the first two.<br /><br />Finally, the end. This is the reason most people are mad. I've read a bunch of novels with a similar ending, and I don't really have a problem with it. People should react the way they are, because, if they don't, then the character didn't make an impact. I just wish it wasn't so anticlimactic and predictable. You know it's coming.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because I feel like there is potential, and I do recommend reading it just because you have to know what happens. But, I just can't give it more- there are too many issues. Sorry, Roth. I really did think it could have been carried out much better.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was a powerful story of hard times and wonderful human connections, duringWorld War II and Nazi Germany. Death Narrates the story (often with compassion) of Liesel Meminger from the time she is taken, at age nine, to live in Molching, Germany, with her new foster parents, Rosa and Hans Hubermann.  In this town she learns to love, to read, to have best friends and to learn the meaning of loyalty.  The written word becomes an obsession with her as you will see, as we follow her journey of discovery and heartache.  Beautifully written with very engaging characters, it is a story that makes you want to read it.
B00005KB9W|5.0|I started listening to this CD back in '95, the same year I first went to Jamaica (Negril).  It made me a huge fan of Bob and I soon had all his albums.  I remember spending nights in my room, back then, preparing grad school applications at night, sipping Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee, and burning incense (no ganja, I assure!), and playing this CD (among all others!).  I also read a great book about the Rastafari (Rastafari: Roots and Ideology) while doing the same as above.<br /><br />Anyway, the album is spectacular.  From the excitement and \\"enheightened\\" vibe of the crowd, to the sound quality of the music and Bob's voice, this really is a special recording that hits on all marks.<br /><br />I remember being in NYC many years later at a very popular specialty restaurant (Babbo?), sitting at the bar, eating.  Out of the blue they played this entire CD and it shortly became a amazingly extraordinary experience!! It had been years since I listened to the CD!  Nowadays, I'm getting back into it.  Enjoy, mon!

This narrative emphasizes the human being behind the mega-star, and this man is magnificent of humanity, due to his exceptional qualities and his brilliant talent. As closely as possible to the truth, we follow the extraordinary life but how much painful of an extraordinary man. This book takes place widely over all those whom I was able to read for 4 years, and we made penetrate into the so difficult and intimate everyday life of a world-famous and recognized man.<br />Thank you Karen Moriarty, for this documented and true work in which shows through the real affection for the man who touched our hearts for ever. You excelled at his defense.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book really fell short. I think the author made a mistake by writing the book in two POVs. It felt forced in spots. It also didn't allow the heroine the respect she deserved toward the end. We find out something huge and before we can digest it the author takes us away from the scene and we are left reading something far less important for over 20 pages. Then when we get back to Tris the author treats it like an unimportant event. Very disappointing. There are several scenes where I feel the detail and thought just wasn't there. I started to love these characters and I wish this trilogy had been wrapped up with more thought and less frantic stumbling to the end.

B00DEE9U0K|5.0|This is an awesome case. Nice glossy finish on front and back. Inside is glossy black with the discs, nothing fancy. Same discs/features as the normal Blu ray release. Usually i would go for the regular release so it would match Season 1 and 2 on the shelf and in fact i did at first. But i ended up returning the movie and opting for this cooler release because i found that every copy of the normal Blu ray release whether from Amazon,Target,Best buy etc. every single damn one has an additional bar code sticker stuck on the actual case artwork print out beneath the plastic of the Blu ray case. They are all horribly placed so that the sticker goes over the edge of the back and onto the sleeve of the Blu ray so that on the shelf part of it has this bar code sticker on it making it look used or second hand. As a collector this really bugged me and my OCD could not let it go. So i returned my standard edition copy to Target and upon finding that  every copy had the same stupid sticker and that the actual distributor had just really messed this one up i decided to trade it in for this beautiful Steel book edition for the exact same price! $35!!!! Way cheaper than on Amazon. And this edition looks beautiful and new and does not have some sticker on it bugging the hell out of me. Definitely recommend this awesome case to fans!
B008EL25LE|2.0|While definitely beautiful from an aesthetic point of view, the game is severely flawed at some point. As a match three game  Azkend 2 is fun enough. There is variety in powers that makes the gameplay useful. But no choice is offered as to which powers to use when. The game also has hidden object moments but never gives choice. Completeing or failing to complete hidden object portions doesn't visibly change the game. There's no bonus money or bonus ability or bonus time. It's just over and then on to the next matching section.<br /><br />As a matching section the most prominent aspect is lightning which is supposed to help you speed up your completion times as well as reach those hard to get areas. However the charging of lightning occurs when you make &#34;good matches&#34; as defined by the game. These definitions are often rather narrow. You get a charge if you cover an area you've never covered before but since oftentimes that's not an option you are deprived of that power as a deliberate choice and it's more often just something that happens in a happenstance. Even when you try to do it deliberately any match that doesn't conform to the &#34;good&#34; standard for that level erases all of your work.<br /><br />At the end what we have is a game that lacks choice. You can't replay levels. You can't choose how you approach levels, you can't control where you go. You aren't rewarded for playing well. In some cases you're punished for not playing into the game.<br /><br />I can't see any replay value in this game once the story mode is completed and since the levels so far (Lvl 4) don't appear to be that difficult and the story not that engaging. I don't have hopes for the &#34;Challenge Mode&#34; to bring about interest.

How handy is that?<br /><br />Following the first chapter on the Jackson reforms themselves, the book deals with a range of issues from legal aid and funding, to case management, disclosure, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), damages and of course, much more, including naturally, several chapters on the various aspects of costs.  As well as the table of secondary legislation, rules, orders, court guides and codes, there's also a glossary, a list of abbreviations and four appendices containing the materials to which practitioners are most likely to refer.<br /><br />Part of the excellent and dependable Blackstone's Guide Series from OUP, the book offers busy practitioners in-built reliability and authority, as well as timeliness and ease of use.  Note here that Stuart Sime and Derek French are also the editors of Blackstone's Civil Practice and have pointed out that the book was published at the same time as the implementation of the 2013 Reforms.disclosure, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), damages and of course, much more, including naturally, several chapters on the various aspects of costs.

The overall aim in view was to advance the process of Europeanisation of private law.<br /><br />As explained in the Foreword, the Study Group has striven to draw up \\"sound and fitting\\" principles with a view to developing proposals and concepts for the further development of private law in Europe. The long term objective of this study in comparative law, we gather, is to achieve what might be called further and better understanding of the possible feasibility of harmonizing European law in the area of -- in this case -- mandate contracts.<br /><br />Whether such harmonization is desirable or not is not for the researchers to decide, say the editors.  Rather, it is a matter for political decision making.  But the fact that this research has been undertaken and has now been made available means that, for the most part, such decision making in the future will almost certainly be more plausible and informed.  What the project has sought to do is to identify areas of common ground within European legal systems - or - to adopt a majority position in areas where common ground is missing.<br /><br />The contributors to this project -- which is truly vast -- hail from literally dozens of top universities and research institutions Europe-wide, from Scandinavia to eastern, southern and of course, western Europe, including the UK which has contributed research form, for example, Oxford, Edinburgh and Sheffield Universities.<br /><br />The research is grouped into some seven chapters which cover such areas as the scope and definition of the mandate contract... the obligations of the principal... performance by the agent... issues regarding changes and conflicts of interest... and grounds for termination.<br /><br />`National Notes' which compare rules and principles across a wide range of European countries are interspersed throughout.  As you would expect, the book is an excellent source of research material, including an extensive table of cases and numerous reading lists.<br /><br />Published by the Oxford University Press, this is a distinguished work of scholarly legal research which aims for complete objectivity and political neutrality.  Academic lawyers, as well as practitioners specialising in cross-border or pan-European matters will welcome its publication.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|This is a great adventure title on par with Kotaro Uchikoshi's previous work, Ever 17. They both share similar themes and plots: a group of people got trapped on the ocean, trying to escape in a certain amount of time, etc. While Ever 17 is at heart a romantic story with elements of sci-fi and disaster set pieces, this one gets darker and plays out more like a SAW-style psychological thriller.<br /><br />Some of the pros:<br />1. Great characters. Despite the large number of cast, they all have distinctive personalities and interesting backstory to make the player care about.<br />2. Meaningful puzzles. Unlike Professor Layton ,which simply throws random puzzles to you, all puzzles in 999 are more or less tied to the scenario at hand; they rarely feel shoe-horned in the story for gameplay's sake.<br />3. Endings. There are 6. They are all awesome. Go play it yourself.<br /><br />Cons:(more like minor gripes)<br />1. Sometimes the characters behave like they aren't worried about the situation at all. They are about to die in a couple of hours, yet they still joke and chat with each other. The game is self-aware about this, as this is pointed out by one of the characters in the latter half of the game. Still, it's weird at times. (The same thing can be said about the overall tone of Ever 17.)<br />2. The music. It's a DS title, so I can't ask much. But it is monotonous at times. I really hope Kotaro can team up with Takeshi Abo(composer of Ever 17 & Steins;Gate) again in the future; sci-fi/thriller is Takeshi's strong suit.

We mention this because of the title of the work: `International Criminal Procedure: Towards a Coherent Body of Law'.  And there you have it in a few words: a summary of the objective of this research; that is, to indicate a conceivable and practical way forward toward the gradual formulation of a truly international body of criminal law.<br /><br />The provisional results of the project were presented to the legal and academic community at the project's final conference at The Hague in October 2011.<br /><br />The outcome, in the words of the editors, was `a set of general rules and principles of international criminal procedure', as well as `recommendations toward improved procedural standards and practice of international and hybrid criminal courts and tribunals.'<br /><br />The dire necessity for such research is revealed in the Introduction to this volume which reminds us of the<br />plethora of courts and tribunals set up between 1993 and 2007 to deal with mass atrocities generated by war in a number of areas, from the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, for example, to Sierra Leone, East Timor, Cambodia and Lebanon.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like the way it appears and is esy to page through..great for the weather nut or not so nuts I think you will like  it
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I must say I agree with A. Woodell. Picked and watched just being wicked curios. It's a good comics based movie, wouldn't say it is a remake. Maybe just another day from judge's life. Hahaha. I would def recommend this movie to watch.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Who are we to judge how this book should end? I immensely enjoyed this book AND who she ended up with. I am sad no more books are coming out.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really liked this game until it kept freezing. Now it is making me mad every time I open the game it freezes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I  purchased this game for my Kindle for my 7 yr old grand-daughter, and she loves it.  It has been a life saver during lengthy appointment waits and when she was down with a cold. Would recommend.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Notepad is easy to use.  Quick for grocery lists or just notes to your self.  Would highly recommend to all.
B006G3JQ78|5.0|It may be a little long for younger kids but our family enjoyed it very much. Julie Andrews looks so young and Dick Van Dyke is so talented.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|MY WHOLE FAMILY AND I LOVE CANDY CRUSH SAGA WE ARE ADDICTED BUT NOT TO SPEND MONEY ON IT. I'VE HAD IT ON MY IPHONE SINCE IT CAME OUT AND MY DAUGHTER FINALLY GOT IT ON HER KINDLE FIRE HD.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Love this type of story, would like to read more of this story, hope to find more like this for my phone.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|A well filmed British Police TV show on the murder and a young boy in a small British sea side town. Doesn't just look at solving the murder, but how it effected his family, friends and the town. Fairly depressing in my opinion but it is quite well done. More and more clues make it quite a twisting turning tale of who done it.
B004I1K2NW|5.0|Love this movie. Just got it on blu ray. Very good quality. If you are a Michael J. Fox fan, it is a must have.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|A hillarious and sometimes sobering look at the fashion world through the eyes of a young job seeker Andy (short for Andrea). How far is she willing to go to succeed in the world of fasion, what is she willing to do to over come obstacles and work her way up the corporate ladder.<br /><br />Funny and enjoyable. Highly recommended!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very subtle story but the puzzles are inventive and challenging all the way through.  Can't wait for a sequel or more content.
B00A0SO4S6|5.0|Quite a fun movie. A wealthy bored bachelor plays a game of catch me if you can with a determined and hardened insurance bounty hunter. Who is smarter, who will win?<br /><br />I especially love the music. A Must Watch.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Eggers nails it again. Interesting subject, compelling characters, well written, what more could you ask for? Now stay out of my head, Amazon, you hear me?
B00555X8OA|5.0|This book is very interesting. I can learn that slow thinking could improve myself more than I've ever thought. Good and valuable book. You should read it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really love this game because it has been one of the best games I have<br />ever played in my hole life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|THIS GAME IS GREAT!!! I LIKE PLAYING IT WHEN IM NOT BUSY, WAS WONDERING WHEN I  WOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT  ON MY KINDLE, NOW I CAN AND I LIKE IT!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Fantastic product that still needs further development. Sadly the only real streaming video site that pairs with this is netflix. I'm a huge fan of amazon prime video and it simply won't stream. There are apps in development for all streaming sites but they are not completed yet.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game very fun also very  entertaining the beach is great I just don't like the Victor part that you have to do.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Tanks for adding Candy Crush to your choices.  I've been waiting on this for my Kindle for a very long time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everyone was talking about this game so I had to try it. So glad I did !! IT'S ADDICTING !!
073642203X|5.0|I love this series for my 2 year old daughter and she asks for these board books every night before bed.  They are the abridged versions of the stories but the attention span of a 2 year old barely makes it through these small books.  I bought the used copy of this book and the quality was actually really good.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Ran across this on Halloween, offered for free. It's different than my usual favorite's, match games. I find it fun and challenging. Cute graphics, sound. I recommend this game. I'm glad I found it.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|Not their best album but still pretty damn good. I love all of the songs. It's not in a plastic case like the others.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent product, good connectivity and easy to install.<br />For a few dollars makes a great function. Nice, Easy, Small and Cheap.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I love the ruthlessness with the characters. The book its self... meh. Needed more meat. The ending, I love. Not every story should have the happy ending where the boy gets the girl.  It's more realistic. Over all I enjoyed the trilogy, and look forward to picking apart the movies, and yelling when they screw it up.
B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|I DON'T ALWAYS USE THE APP BUT, HOWEVER, WHEN I DID ITWAS SO EASY AND ENLIGHTING THAT IT'S MAKES YOU FEEL SO GOOD.  EVERYONE SHOULD USEWHEN THEIR FEELING DOWN.<br />KP
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|If you have Verizon FiOS you might want to check and make sure your equipment supports the required protocols. I did get it to work at the office and is pretty slick little toy.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Love the blog, and love the book. It honours some of the classic stories from the blog and contains lots of new stories too. Could read it over and over and still laugh.
B000KIPT30|2.0|this was a great headphone amp but started not working after six months. It still kinda works but the input jack cuts in and out so kinda broken kinda annoying 2 stars
B007EC27QM|5.0|Works great, very clean design... Love that it shows my last equations. Worth the download and price. Price price price.

B00CZ7OC46|5.0|Marissa Mayer might have put an end to Yahoo's work-from-home policy, but working remotely is alive and well in many other organisations, according to Jason Fried in this book. A company that embraces remote work gets access to the best talent and frees its workers from soul-crushing commutes, and if remote work is managed correctly the company can gain significantly increased productivity.<br /><br />Arguments which the author presents in favour of remote working include:<br /><br />* Work in an office is often unproductive due to constant interruptions<br />* Commuting wastes an enormous amount of time, energy and resources<br />* Technology now allows highly effective remote working<br />* The shift to asynchronous collaboration accommodates everyone's availability<br />* Remote working allows you to base yourself anywhere in the world<br />* Expensive office rental costs can be avoided<br /><br />There are, of course, issues that need to be addressed for remote working to operate efficiently. It appears that employees of the author's organisation do work of a type which is readily measurable, so that it is easy to ensure that people are doing the work they are paid for. A business could quickly deteriorate if work results were not measurable or if some employees started feeling that others were not pulling their weight. It is also important that employees have a sufficient level of interaction with each other, and the book provides a number of strategies to address this.<br /><br />In my opinion this book will be very useful for any organisation which is thinking about allowing employees to work remotely, as well as for any organisation which currently has some remote workers but needs to improve its remote work management processes.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game to play to pass the time. Not to easy not to hard. Good for me little to try to play as well.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|I cannot overstate how much I enjoyed this movie. I walked out on a high. You must experience this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The only thing that sucks is waiting 24 hours between boss level missions.and also waiting for lives in general.great for kids too
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I've been a big fan of Clancy for years.  But I've been less than thrilled by the Jack Junior books.  After hearing about Clancy 's death I decided to read the three most recent.  This is the best of the recent batch, and far better than the previous novel (title escapes me at the moment).  Some of the events were a bit forced and seemed unlikely, even in the Clancy universe.  But it was a fun read which kept my attention.  It was the \\"can't put it down) book like some of his earlier novels, but was still an engaging story.
B00AECDDYY|3.0|Needs more levels and more ship options possibly more story line, but still a fun game to kill time with overall a B+
B009RX7IX8|5.0|We have all 5 seasons of Castle and very often our family has a marathon.  We love that it is not &#34;serious&#34; and the cast makes more fun.  It is great, can't wait for season 6.
B005LAIIN0|2.0|BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!! The only thing scarey in this movie is that Brad Pitt played a hero which actually was funnier than scary.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicted... I stopped looking for thing game for the kindle and it just showed up!! So excited!! Works great, no glitches, and synced with my Facebook!!! Woo Hoo!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much better to plat on a kindle fire than any other tablet I have owned. It's bright and the colors are great!!!!! Thanks kindle fire fir a job well done.......
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|everyone in my family loves this game. we wish the lives were endless so we could keep playing. great graphics and storyboard as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game. Very exciting when you reach higher levels. Real challenging. Have recommended to several friends and my mom. She loves it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The book was well written, especially with the alternating view points, and then it was crushing when it was just one view point but it increased the needed feelings of grief. Also, the first few short chapters after the loss may have been the best part of the book for me -- such a wonderful character response and summary of the few things that can be said or thought after a loss like that.<br /><br />The story was painful but ultimately I thought it was a great ending to the series and I would recommend it to anyone. The beginning was somewhat slow and hard to get into with all kinds of new details and plot twists, but the rest of the story picks up. I was angry at first with the author but the ending and the epilogue made it worth it for me.<br /><br />Great exploration of a dystopian theme showing the strengths and weaknesses of human nature.
B00E9ZATJO|4.0|Monster’s University is a good film and a fun time at the movies, especially for children.  However, at the same time, I cannot say that this is one of Pixar’s strongest films either.  The same can be said for Monster’s Inc.  I saw Monster’s Inc. years ago and remember liking it okay, but not being blown away by it either.  I thought it was mediocre.  I think that Monsters’ Inc.  is one of my least favorite Pixar films.  The same can be said for this film.  On its own it is a pretty good film and got some laughs out of me, but compared to many of Pixar’s past works like, The Incredibles, Wall-E, Finding Nemo,  and the Toy Story films, this one seemed a tad underwhelming.  Those films that I mentioned appealed to both children and adults, while this film gears more towards kids.<br /><br />One of the film’s problems is that it is very formulaic.  Until the last half hour the story was very cliché and I knew pretty much how it would play out.  You have the main character, Mike (Billy Crystal), who as a dream to be the scariest monster.  However, he starts out the underdog, is ridiculed by his peers, and has to work his way to the top.  I have seen that many times before.  You also have the extremely cocky best friend, Sullivan (John Goodman), who is very full of himself and has to learn to be more humble.  You also have the other gang of misfits that are there for comic relief and periodically help out.  You also have the rival gang of bullies that the heroes must defeat.  The first hour felt very cliché to me.<br /><br />However, the last half hour I did not see coming actually.  The part where Mike and Sullivan are trapped in the human world is definitely my favorite part of the movie.  I also like how Mike and Sullivan finally resolve their differences and help each other.  At first I was going to give this film three stars.  However, the ending made me bump up the rating a bit.<br /><br />Overall, Monsters’ University is a fun time at the movies.Children should love it.  It is a good film to take your children to.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so hooked on this game.  I wish the lives would last longer, that is the only downfall.  Awsome game
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Could not put it down for long. Got lost in the book for days! It's a must read
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I loved the great gastby it was an amazing movie. I loved the new version of this movie it was a good interpritation
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|This game has very little appealing things to it.<br />Slender man has very jittery movement that is not smooth, and teleports away if you look at it.<br />Major graphic bugs like over lapping textures and non-smooth 3D mapping.<br />The game is as scary as a rubber mask, a poor rubber mask with pink hair and blue face of a kitten.<br />Goose bumps, but not much more.<br /><br />No buy.
B004LL1HMY|5.0|I just bought the vinyl, listened to it and I can't get enough. This album is more than what I expected. I recommend everyone to purchase this record, you won't regret it.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Fun app and a cute way to spend some time getting away from work stress.  I like the humor because he doesn't always get the girl.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|To be upfront I don't care for modern horror movies. All too often they emphasize gore and shock while leaving the characters and story well behind. Needlessly to say I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Let the Right One In\\". To say this is a classic Vampire tale leaves out a great deal of what makes this film truly special.<br /><br />Oskar is a shy, withdrawn and unfortunately bullied student who is often ignored at home by his always-working mother and his distant father is an alcoholic. Oskar spends his time collecting newspaper articles of murder stories and pretending to get back at his tormentors by killing them with his knife. Essentially, Oskar has all the makings of a serial killer.<br /><br />One night Eli appears atop the jungle gym in the courtyard and confronts Oskar. She tells him that they cannot be friends, but a friendship develops anyway. Like Oskar, Eli is also twelve years old but she's been that way for a long time because after all, she's a vampire.<br /><br />More than a simple horror film, this is really a classic love story of two children on the brink of becoming adults. But while Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) is destined to grow older, Eli (Lina Leandersson) will remain the same. This simple conundrum is compounded by other factors. For example, the small fact that Eli is a stone-cold killer. Although we see her initially regret her actions, Eli is who she is and that's it. This instantly separates \\"Let the Right One In\\" from the more \\"sparkly\\" treatments of vampire movies in recent years. To say more about the story of the film will rob it of the many surprises that awaits inside. However, I will say that both Eli and Oskar come to resolutions about their true natures in a very logical manner which makes this film a cut above most.<br /><br />\\"Let the Right One In\\" is beautifully photographed, one of the best I've seen. Not just for the scenic overviews of snowy Sweden but the composition of the shots are truly powerful. The first time Eli is fully revealed is beautifully rendered in pan shot that instantly harbors her true nature. The climatic scene of the film which takes place at a indoor swimming pool is also a classic of framing where so much is implied, but very little is actually seen. This entire film almost plays more like a fairy tale which adds to the timeless nature of the material. It also helps that there are moments of humor even in the most dire of circumstances.<br /><br />The two children who play Oskar and Eli are wonderful in their roles and quite expressive as well. I can only hope that they go on to do excellent work in the future as they are simply mesmerizing here. It actually helps that Lina's true voice was dubbed to make her more androgynous which is an important plot point in the film. Also, because the deeper voice makes her character more interesting and helps convey the wisdom that is well beyond her age, but not her years on this planet. Both actors should be applauded for creating unforgettable characters that we really care about, which instantly puts \\"Let the Right One In\\" above many of its contemporaries.<br /><br />Is \\"Let the Right One In\\" a true classic? I can't really say. It certainly has all the makings of one, however. If anything, it is easily the greatest film ever made whose title comes from the lyric of a Morrissey song.revealed is beautifully rendered in pan shot that instantly harbors her true nature.

B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great for when your bored and need something to play. It will keep you occupied for hours trying to kill the dangerous creatures.
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|This is only good if you are used to using RPM, otherwise it becomes a useless calculator that's not worth the price.
031623480X|5.0|This book was delivered timely and in excellent condition.  I am gluten intolerant and find the information provided in the book to be relevant and easy to understand.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The only thing that could have made Allegiant better would have been for the book to spontaneously combust in my hands after I finished reading. Veronica Roth is so brave and gutsy to have ended it the way she did -- true to the characters, if not to the readers.  The fact that so many people are upset is a testament to how good of a writer she is.  If it was a crappy series, no one would care.  Instead people are distraught, angry, shocked, and awed.  Allegiant was a perfect ending to the story.  Can't wait to read whatever comes next for this up-and-coming author!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Fast read. Didn't want to put down. Needed to keep reading to discover the secrets. Looking forward to the next book.
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|I admit, I didn't read Eat, Pray, Love... But this novel certainly doesn't live up to what I know the hype for that one was. The main character was not only unsympathetic but was also irritating. The topics were so obscure as to be impossible to relate to anything I have experienced. In short, I'm not a fan...and the only reason I gave it two stars is because occasionally it teased me into believing that it might be a good story. Definitely not worth the  ridiculous price I paid for this kindle book.
B004JMY312|5.0|This is a Halloween Classic, we watch it every year in my family. I would say that Hocus Pocus is Sarah Jessica Parker's defining film appearance.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Thanks for letting me replace my damaged kindle cable cord.  The length is perfect for letting me read while it is charging.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Duh!  Its Ender's Game.  I will see it this weekend and already know I will love it.  Gads, I have to have 16 words?  It doesn't take that many.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game has not only amazing graphics but it is great fun. Good for on the go and great missions. Thanks for this awesome free game.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|It is a really fun game although sometimes it can get a little hard. It isn't quite worth the price though.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great read! King at his best. Perfect follow up to The Shinning. Hard to put it down. Had to know what was going to happen next. LOVE this book!!
1611137527|5.0|I read or listen to all of Malcom Gladwell's books. He's IS the best author. He always make me think &#34;stop and example things closer&#34; pill back the layers on the onion. GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Very good compilation of Kelly Clarkson songs.  This has most of her hits so far.  My daughter loves her music and loved this album. Fast shipping too.
B000C13Y2S|1.0|It broke as I took it out of the package....EXTREMELY cheaply made.  The plastic stands break with just a small touch.
B002VWNICW|5.0|If you like Pride and Prejudice you should enjoy this movie. It is a little different that the book, but very charming. The blue ray version is very clear and I am glad I purchased it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book poses an interesting theory on man's fate if he destroyed the world.  Those that survived the apocalypse would remain forever prisoners in isolated colonies, divorced from the outside world, alone and subject to the tyranny that enforced imprisonment inevitably produces, where the haves dictate to the have-nots, where any dissent results in the severest of punishments - in this case, &#34;cleaning&#34;.  I really enjoyed the story, found it well thought-out, easy to read and at the end wishing the story would continue.
B00E0ZEDI6|5.0|Nice album. I love ordering this off amazon. They download or are shipped so fast. This album is the acoustic version of several songs plus one on Midsummer Station.  I like it.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Great game.  Love the multiple levels and will buy other FlipPix apps.  The part I like the best is you can replay the levels without being bored by them.
B003R0LBVW|3.0|I wouldn't have minded the length as I read hefty books all the time. My take is, okay, the author captured our attention, but he was too needy to let it go and elaborated on the mundane. Some stories need to take up such volume; this one didn't. It was like being stuck listening to someone you wanted to get away from an hour ago. Overall not impresssd. Anything good is cancelled out by the droning.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy this is finally available for kindle!  Great graphics, and really close to the Pc version. Thank you Amazon and King! I love this game!
0547884591|5.0|Before I got this book I could cook only a few meals. Now, I feel competent in the kitchen. Following this book helped me build a lot of skills as a &#34;chef,&#34; and it was fun. Also, most of the dishes are Slow Carb, so it was easier to stay on my diet. I love cooking now; whereas, I never liked it before.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book! I cried and laughed! A beautiful poignant story - designed for any cynical adult! Bravo Garth Stein!
B005TPCR2U|4.0|Awesome! Hated the end !!!!:( Anne Hathaway is my fav ! That guy took their friendship for granted for a while! But they always ended up together ..somehow !
B004QL7K6G|5.0|I found this movie to be both hilarious and entertaining.<br /><br />Anyone who disliked this movie is probably because there are several shots of exposed human male genitalia, which many people find uncomfortable....but when it is used for comedic purposes, I find it pretty funny.<br /><br />To keep things short, I'll say is that I found this movie to be different from the status quo in many ways...it still follows the hollywood plot formula, but there are many unexpected lines and moments to keep you laughing.<br /><br />I say it's a must see for the twisted mind and a definite no go for kids, or even for teenagers, as they wouldn't understand much of the humor.
B0049P244W|4.0|GREAT MOVIE TO WATCH. TWISTED ENDING BUT GREAT MOVIE. VERY ENTERTAINING<br />RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT LIKES ACTION MOVIES. AND WHO LIKES DICAPRIO.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|loved it  would reccommed it  to everyone I know on Facebook and my e-mail.  It can be very hard to put down.
B004G6009K|5.0|I had this movie in Blue-ray already, my sister got it in 3D and I really enjoyed hers.  I love the 3D in this, it's great.  I love how the lanterns float out into the room and it's just beautiful!  This was a great 3D movie, to an already great animated story.  This is the new fairy tale story line, with the strong female who isn't actually saved by the prince. She actually saves him a few times, and he her, with the help of others and a cute funny horse....I love the horse!!<br /><br />The movie arrived as promised, condition was perfect.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book seem to not grab my attention,but after a few pages I was hooked. I loved the ending- it brought the story full circle.
B00DY76Z32|4.0|I had my movie night ruined, movie didn't play, the 3D, or blue ray, untill I put it back in & in settings did an update with the movie in.  The family went home before I discovered that another update had to be done. The movie was good 3D, but I wish they wouldn't make a movie so hard to actually watch.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Nice graphics. My kiddo (8 year old girl) really liked it the first time she played it, kinda forgot about it since. We downloaded on our Kindle Fire.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I'm 9 and I really like the game you take care cute dogs,cats,rabbits,zebra,and others<br />You get the collection of each pet they<br /><br />Become a different colour to is so cool
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Well written, excellent plot. I just could not put the book down. I hope I find a book this good soon.
B0012HQKZE|5.0|This is the second time I watched this movie.  The cast is great and Anthony Hopkins' performance is outstanding.  interesting relationship between Alec Baldwin and Hopkins.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|people aren't allowed to buy apps so can you please let it be free you will make people happy.  thank you?
B005K17RU0|5.0|Choices are made by availability and this app is a very good choice.So if not this weather app what else is there.
1601251556|5.0|My friend introduced me to the usefulness of something as simple as a blocked map. For years we have been just winging is since we never thought to use a mat for markers. My players like it because we can draw on it and don't actually need miniatures. White board markers work perfect! It cleans off with a tissue or a hand wipe!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This version is even better than the one on my laptop.  It was worth waiting for. :o)  Would definitely recommend it.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|This puzzle is a nice way to unwind after a busy day.  Easy, but not too easy.  I would recommend it.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Fun and addictive game. The kids enjoy it and I even sneak some play time in occasionally. Good clean fun.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It's really fun but when it comes to gems and more gems.... IT GETS BORING!!!!!!!when you go to the section where you can play the three booths to theories , it makes you pay!!! Like, what the heck man!!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|If your friends haven't raved about Firefly, then you probably don't hang out with many geeks.<br /><br />While Firefly takes place in the future and in space, it is in no way a &#34;Sci-Fi&#34; show.  In fact, there's more science fiction in shows like CSI than in Firefly.<br /><br />The characters drive the show and they all have incredible depth to them.  The writing is absolutely top notch.  It is a shame that the show was canceled after only its first season.  However, has Nathan Fillion said, &#34;the upside is that it never gave us a chance to be bad.&#34;<br /><br />Are there any downsides?  Well, yes.  One.  You need to have 14 hours free to watch them all one after another.  Then you'll want to watch again to pick up all of the subtle clues and details you missed the first run.<br /><br />Don't forget to watch the movie Serenity after you get done.
B008476HBM|5.0|It's by far the best book I have ever read!! So Romantic!! This book is my new favorite novel and will be reading it again.
0767827716|5.0|Classic love it
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Great show and a great season. Well, every season is great, now that I think about it. Definitely worth picking up!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King has done it again with Doctor Sleep, a sort of sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34; where Dan Torrence is all grown up but still has a bit of the shining in him.  He meets a young girl who has a much larger gift of the shining, so much so that people are after her for it.  The book moves along at a very fast pace and builds suspense culminating in a heart-pounding ending.  Highly recommend!

B0068FYZ84|4.0|This movie does not seem to get enough recognition that it deserves. It is so much better than the silly, ridiculous talking animal movies we see today like Cats and Dogs 2. At least the animals in this movie behave normally and have good morals.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This is an interesting and absorbing account of a time that most seniors would rather forget. The fictional characters are wonderfully described and will help the younger generation to appreciate a time in history that should not be forgotten. Both my husband and I would give this book four stars for plot, literacy and historical significance.<br /><br />.
1451666179|5.0|I follow Allie's blog and when she said that the book was about half old stuff and half new, I thought \\"well I can skim the old stuff.\\"  I was wrong. What she failed to say is that she has elaborated on the old stuff and made it pretty much new again. This woman has a very real gift for storytelling to the point that your co-workers and family look at you like there is something wrong because you just fell over laughing out loud because you couldn't contain it anymore. Bravo Allie!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What a GREAT sequel!! I hated putting it down, and it's all I thought about when I had to. Wonderful reading, I even think I liked it better than \\"The Shining\\", that's hard to do!!! If you liked/loved \\"The Shining\\" READ THIS BOOK. You will not be disappointed.

B00F0O8SZK|4.0|Susan Boyle is the poster child for grace.  In a cultural milieu where the success of the next star is based on her ability to raise testosterone levels of her audience via her bodily gymnastics and her gaudy attire, Susan Boyle is the antonym of all of this.  Rather, unveiling her debut appearance on “Britain’s Got Talent,” was a middle- aged lady of slightly ample proportions delivering a gallant version of Les Miserables’ “I Dreamed a Dream” devoid of any slattern innuendoes.  This performance was watched by over 10 million viewers and Boyle became an overnight sensation. Her audition YouTube video was watched by 2.6 million people within the first 72 hours.  And by the end of that year with 120 million viewings, her clip was the most watched YouTube video of the year.  One of Boyle’s greatest strengths is that she has brought back a bygone era whereby singers appealed to the audience not through the prostitution of their body parts but through their stately and awestruck singing of pop hits and standards.  Therefore, it is of no surprise that her debut release “I Dreamed a Dream” was UK’s fastest selling debut record of all time.<br /><br />Boyle has spent the bulk of 2013 wrapped up in Christmas projects.  Later this year, we will see her acting debut as Eleanor Hopewell in the movie &#34;The Christmas Candle.&#34; Written by famous Christian author Max Lucado, “The Christmas Candle” is a story about a 19th-century village of simple people in the English Cotswolds in need of a miracle.  Out of this movie project is the theme song “Miracle Hymn” which is included here on “Home for Christmas.” Interestingly, of Boyle’s 6 album portfolio, 2 of them are seasonal offerings.  “Home for Christmas,” unlike her preceding “The Gift,” contains entirely of traditional carols and previously released seasonal favorites with only original tagged to the end of the record.  The original is the aforementioned “Miracle Hymn.”  “Miracle Hymn” bears all the trinkets of a Christmas song: a re-telling of the birth of the Christ child, a children’s choir and an orchestrated backing.  But relative to the classic Christmas songs on the disc, this Candace Lee and Luke Atencio composition pales in terms of its melodic prowess.<br /><br />Highly anticipated is Boyle’s “duet” with the late Elvis Presley on “O Come All Ye Faithful.”  Thanks to modern technologies, Boyle gets to sing around an early recording of the King of Pop.  The song starts off with Boyle singing the first verse before Presley’s low reaching bass comes in at the second.  After which a children’s choir gets to sing with the two bringing the carol to a climatic high. One of the most touching carol is “Little Drummer Boy.” A story song that tells of a poor boy being summoned by a Magi to the nativity scene; without a gift, all the boy could offer to Jesus was to play his best on his drums.  Here Boyle with his sensitive and measured delivery succinctly captures the innocence and the vulnerability of the song’s gist.  While on “The Lord’s Prayer,” Boyle shows us the full range of her mezzo-soprano from the soft opening whispers to her high octave elongated belts.<br /><br />Johnny Mathis, though a safe and comfortable duet partner, hardly adds much color to their version of “When a Child is Born.”  More adventurous is Boyle’s take of the controversial “I Believe in Father Christmas.”  Written by Greg Lake and Peter Sinfield and first recorded by Toyah Wilcox in 1982, this song is iconoclastic smashing all rose-colored images of Christmas exposing us to the reality of celebrating Christmas in our sin infested world.  Thus, “Home for Christmas” is not just your average warm and cozy effort; but home for Boyle is realistic.  Yet, even in life’s ups and downs, through her expressive and comforting voice she still leads us to the Christ of Christmas.cle Hymn” bears all the trinkets of a Christmas song: a re-telling of the birth of the Christ child, a children’s choir and an orchestrated backing.

B00821PCJS|5.0|Reminds me of Walking Dead, with Aliens and not Zombies and blood.  Would be worth a try.  Enjoy!  I have.
B00EC7GRS6|1.0|This would have been a fine product if it wasn't so expensive.  As it stands the cord is too short and the base is too light.  When you pick up your phone the base will still stick to the phone due to the magnet and the fact that the base is light cheap plastic.  The cord will not reach from my desk to the ground so i had to buy a usb extension cable.<br /><br />Additionally you can't use this dock to connect to your pc.

B000001GQP|5.0|If you need to get motivated to get up and move, raise your spirits, or just get your foot to tapping, this is the recording for you. Once you start to listen to this opera you can understand why an excerpt from \\"Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi\\" is played at some sporting events to get the team and crowd into the game.<br /><br />With the direction of Eugen Jochum and the bonus of the incomparable rich, powerful voice of baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, this 1968 performance is a classic, and very probably the best, recording of the opera. The reproduction quality from the original Deutsche Grammophon recording is clear and clean.<br /><br />The CD includes an insert booklet with the lyrics and translation.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00BKZUVGM|3.0|I just finished the book and I just couldn't believe it. I was thinking the whole time: you can't kill Harry Potter (and not revive him!!), meaning &#34;you can't kill your heroine!!&#34;.<br />I mean, of course she can and she did... I was just shocked. Tris was almost super human, she always found a way of staying alive and at the end when she and Four could go away and have a boring but happy life together full of kids or whatever, she died.<br />Oh well. It was (maybe) brave of Veronica to do so, but that might affect the movie franchise and of selling more books, since no one wants to read a YA novel in which the heroine dies. But I think she is still pretty young and getting established as a new best seller author and will probably write more stories that will be better developed and hopefully won't end with death!<br /><br />Cheers

1476727651|5.0|So loved this book! Had been anticipating it for so long and it didn't disappoint. Am glad I read The Shining again before I read Dr Sleep, it re-acquainted me with the characters and their feelings and set the scene for the next chapter in Dan Torrance's life. Stephen King is a story telling genius!

B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|If the first 'Black Radio' CD was 5 stars (which undoubtedly it is), I would have to give this one 4.5 stars due to some of the repetitive arrangements.  While this CD didn't have as eclectic a sound as Black Radio 1, this is still better than 99.9 % of everthing else that is being played on the radio.  I loved the spoken Word additions. Looking forward to Black Radio 3...hopefully with some collaborations with Gregory Porter, Black Thought (from the Roots), Saul Williams and Sade.

It made one think about their own mortality and what our presence in life means. It was a wonderful love story that caused me to cry when reading certain parts. I highly recommend this book to all those who want to read a  book that causes one to think. Thank you to my daughter for recommending it to me.

B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Pay no attention to those people behind the curtain claiming that this film does an injustice to the work of L. Frank Baum.  They are of no consequence.<br /><br />Great stories often tell of a personal transformation, and I loved the transition from Oz the scoundrel to Oz the leader.  Franco played the scoundrel Oz quite well, I thought, and I believed he was still the scoundrel right up to the point that he proved he wasn't.<br /><br />I went into this movie with a great sense of trepidation caused by a legion of bad reviews, and one again I loved a thoroughly panned film.  I was able to sit through the entire sequence twice (once in 2D and once again in 3D) without once trying to figure out why this take on Baum's Oz was less effective than the 1939 one, which I also love dearly.  I did, however, greatly enjoy identifying the connections between this obvious prequel and the 1939 classic.<br /><br />If you can go into this feature without preconceived notions of Oz that you insist it live up to, you may have an enjoyable experience, as I did.

B00F33E3C0|5.0|Caf&eacute; In Berlin is really one story broken into ten chapters, rather than ten short stories, as the subtitle says.  I am a mid 40's male attempting to relearn and expand my high school German.  Along with some audio language programs, I've found Andre Klein's various titles and this one I like the best.  It's mostly present tense, and written in a simple first person narrator point of view.  HIs Sicilian character tells you all you need to know about being a foreigner in modern Berlin, trying to learn the language, fit in, have a good time, get a job and meet some girls.  It's not stretching any literary boundaries, but there is some humor tucked into the story.  Vocabulary is simple, his end of chapter translations of key vocab are good checkpoints, and he has a knack for storytelling.  For me, it all added up to a great reading experience, not taxing, not frustrating, just enough of a challenge.  Everyone's experience will vary according to their mastery of the language, naturally, so I think it would be impossible to call it a one size fits all book.  But if you're wanting a no sweat simple piece to test your abilities, I don't think you can wrong here.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I loved Daria as a teen. She was just so.... real.<br /><br />When my daughter hit her teens, we rented the Daria series from Netflix and she fell in love. Two years later she was still begging us to buy her the collection, so we did. The disks worked fine and the set includes the movies as well.<br /><br />While driving my two daughters to school the other day I looked in the rearview mirror and saw my blond step-daughter bobbing her head to her ipod and my brunette daughter in her grey jacket & glasses scowling. Then looked at myself on my way to an office job and thought of my husband being goofy.<br /><br />Yes, Daria is a story about us.

B00D5LC4GY|5.0|I choose this rating because I love a good challenge no matter what kind. No matter how many black blocks are preinstalled I will fit all the different color block patterns in the square without overlapping any of the black blocks. I am undefeated when it comes to Cubetris! But when I attempt to place a pattern and it jumps off the board when I release  it counts as a move, one move too many and it affects my score...don't like it. If you are square crazy I recommend Cubetris..5 stars baby 5... love it! Thank you I just thought of something does Cubetris ever end, I mean does it ever end and give you a overall score. Because I was just thinking it goes on and on and on. I love it does it ever end?

B005K17RU0|4.0|I like that the weather is right on my main page of my kindle. The temps have been good too.
006212725X|3.0|My friend lent me this book, and he had the best comment: \\"It seems Pete doesn't understand what the reader wants to read about\\".  He didn't care for it, and I found it a bit lacking.  He does tell his life story, but many of the stories I have read a more descriptive version elsewhere.  I would have liked more of the in studio experience, and some more emotions where needed.  Notably, Moon's death really didn't get any emotional feeling in the book (maybe there wasn't as much as I thought there would be in real life).  Also, you presume he got divorced, but he didn't address it.  I don't need a blow by blow, but he wrote about his wife, so closure would be helpful.  He does address his internet issues in a quite staightforward manner, though. I realize that Pete is obviously a giant in the history of rock, but my biggest criticism is that the hugely influential music writing ended about the time Moon died.  The last third of the book is rehash of old glories - \\"Tommy\\" on Broadway, remakes of \\"Quadrophenia\\", and finally \\"Lifehouse\\" over and over.  Nothing really happens in the last third of the book, and I really got sick of Lifehouse, this and Lifehouse that.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|While this book was not as good as it predecessors, it did its job--entertained me for a few hours. I agree with other reviewers that the voice and storytelling were not as strong as in the earlier installments, a fact for which I was later glad, as falling in love with these characters again would have made the ending even more devastating.<br />Unlike other reviewers, I CAN see the point in the ending, its just not a point i think should be made in YA lit.  Kids will find out life stinks soon enough, let their books have a little hope.
0393317552|5.0|The book attempts to explain why Europeans dominated the world for a period of time and now no longer do.  It has nothing to do with some mysterious genetic superiority of one people over another.  Diamond summarized his findings as follows: \\"History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples environments, not because of biological differences among people themselves.\\"<br /><br />The major driver was that the Fertile Crescent contained seed crops and animals (sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, and horses) that lent themselves to successful domestication. This domestication then spread roughly along the same parallel east to Asia and west to Europe.  Domestication didn't spread in the America's and Africa's due to their north-south orientation.  Advances quickly moved back and forth between east and west, but climatic zone differences inhibit flows north and south. This resulted in massive food production in Eurasia. Food production, in turn, led to stationary populations and excess food that supported artists, bureaucrats and soldiers and sophisticated technologies (guns and steel).<br /><br />Population density along with close contact with animals, led to germs affecting large numbers of people.  As infectious diseases killed large numbers, the surviviors developed immunity to them. The black death is a good example. Anywhere from 30% to 60% of the total population in Europe died. The population did rebound over time.  In the Americans, disease killed 95% of the Native American population, which was estimated at  20,000,000 decimated in 1492. Germs didn't have the same impact in Africa as it wasn't isolated from Eurasia and so had been affected my the same diseases.<br /><br />Technology advantages, plus immunity to most germs, allowed Eurasians to easily subdue the natives of the Americas, Australia and Southeast Asia.<br /><br />At the end of book Diamond addresses why Europe instead of the Fertile Crescent or China end up ontop during the last 500 years.  For the Fertile Crescent he states that it is due to resource depletion.  For China Diamond claims it is because there were no geographic barriers in that part of the world so China was unified politically  - so a decision made centrally affected all of China.  In Europe the opposite was the case. There are so many geographic barriers that Europe was not unified politically.  China was ahead of Europe in almost every area in the 1400s.  They had massive fleets with ships orders of magnitude bigger than Europe had at the time exploring under the command of Zheng He from 1405 to 1433.  However, when the faction that support the fleets fell out of favor, the exploration were abandoned and the information about the fleets suppressed and China turned inward.  In Europe.  Columbus was able to go from court to court until he found backing for his voyage.  My personal opinion is that this doesn't fully explain the China vs Europe issue and that there were more factors involved.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as it does shed light on how the world got the way it is.
0452298482|5.0|Normally, I would not have chosen this book because of its title. I am 71 yrs young and have read so many &#34;message books&#34;, but someone selected it for our book club and I read it so I could participate in the evening's discussion.<br /><br />Out of a rating of 10, 10 being the highest score, I gave it a 10.75!!! I the book changed me down to the depths of my soul. I became a better person and those changes still continue after 2 months.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to people of all ages.<br /><br />Yom Kippur is a day of atonement for Jewish people. For me it is a time to look back over the year and see how I can become a better person. After our family dinner I brought 3 copies of the book for us to share and read - the last chapter. My pre-teen and teenage grandchildren even participated and we took the teachings from this book as a springboard to comment on what we could do to be improve our way of being.

006202406X|1.0|I agree with everyone giving bad reviews on this book for 2 reasons that are constantly brought up as u scroll down the list.<br /><br />1.) seriously?! Tris gets bullets shot at her almost every hour from book one up til now n the dumbest shot kills her? IF YOURE GOING TO KILL OFF THE MAIN CHARACTER THEN GIVE IT JUSTICE! Give HER justice! I mean screw the justice! What the hell was the whole point in killing her?? Yeah sure i get it, trying to be realistic n symbolic plus shock factor blah blah, but look at the outcome! Why should i read any more roth books if she just gets tired in the last installment n butchers all of it anyway??<br /><br />2.) and why would u make tobias n tris sound EXACTLY THE SAME?? Wheres the symbolism in that?! Want to be realistic?! How about making them talk differently because in reality, people dont think and talk  in the EXACT SAME ATTITUDE.<br /><br />There are only two possible explanations for this poor excuse for an ending.<br />- roth got lazy<br />- roth wanted to be \\"realistic\\"<br /><br />Regardless of whether its one or both of those reasons, neither of them justify this atrocity and for me, roth has totally lost my respect.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I have not seen this move for a long time. But eventually when I did, I realized how good it is.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I like it but the  power core system bugs me, other then that its fun for a free game,  try it.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Uh, I mean as the title says it is pretty good and alright. I doesn't dab  your history though :(
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fascinating frustrating. Loads of fun.cant believe one can have so much fun moving candy beans one square at a time!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I have already deleted the app.  Terrible! Of was not at all like the original game.  Not worth my time.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This will be a perfect way to have a relaxed respite from a hectic day. Very enjoyable, tranquil and fun.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I saw the movie first and really wants to know more so I download the ebook. Better than the movie. I wll buy the girl who played with the fire next.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Works flawlessly and gives me all I want and need and more.  I recommend this app for all who want to have a quick reference Bible (many versions) at their fingertips.,
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Simply put, it'll change you. But, like most things that shake your soul, don't assume it is the answer. As in, maybe you learn something, maybe it motivates you or helps you, and it will. But don't go ripping your shoes off and sprinting down hot asphalt. I'm all for and simaltanously leary of barefoot running. Yes, I changed my form and it helped me tremendously. I run with fewer injuries and faster than ever before, but I still wear shoes, occasionally going minimal shoes for speed drills, but a few years ago minimal shoes were called racing flats, and I'm sure in the future they'll be called, earth be gone's or something. We have been running this way for awhile, so don't go jumping out the door and if you do, work up to it. 1 mile to 3 miles for a week and then build.<br /><br />That aside.<br /><br />This book is an amazing account of legends, and a legendary run that we got to peek into. It gives you not only glimpses into a race, but into humans. In the end, it's a book that compels you, much like a marathon does, to be nice to one another. I'm a runner, and it makes me a better person, simply because when your hungry and depleted and a stranger takes time off from work, or life to stand in their front yard with their kids, and hand you water that they bought with their own money, it breaks your heart. It picks you up from mile 22 and carries you until mile 26.2. I run, and I finish and I go back to the starting line and I dare people not to sprint, but to relax and put a smile on their face. Staying positive, it will make a difference, and this book gives you everything. I cried so many times as just like watching someone struggle to finish, you struggle to not feel for them. Reading pages that fly through about a person breaking apart and all you can do is hope they put one more foot down in front of the other. It's beautiful. And this book captures it, it seals stories we've never heard into a time capsule, it gives us new idea's and nutritional tips. It will, without a doubt in my mind, change you.<br />And it should.<br />It's a big bad world out there, this book is a study on humans more than it is a book on running.<br />Be nice to each other, and say thank you and give a high five to that kid out there on a sunday morning handing out water.will, without a doubt in my mind, change you.<br />And it should.<br />It's a big bad world out there, this book is a study on humans more than it is a book on running.<br />Be nice to each other, and say thank you and give a high five to that kid out there on a sunday morning handing out water.
1451666179|5.0|Tore into this book and read the whole thing in about an hour, and I can tell I'll be renting this out aka pushing it on my friends for weeks to come. Husband is guffawing through his own reading as I write this.  Freaking hilarious content - the depression stories had me laughing while crying, and the dog stories made me tear up from laughter. There are also other stories that do not involve crying at all. Most of them, probably, if you have a normal response to humor. Anyway, if you've enjoyed anything on her website, or funny Paint drawings, or really want some laughs, get this book asap!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|the acting is excellent -- the content always relevant....what can i say --- i love it!  my husband and i are never disappointed.
030759565X|5.0|Great recipes and a fun voice. We have made the brownie rollout cookies with crushed candycanes several times over the holidays (or even outside the holidays...) because they are addictive.  The gooey cinnamon squares weren't that exciting, but there are many more I want to try.  Interesting versions of all sorts of recipes, and occasional adorable kid photos as well. Very fun to look through and cook from.
1594744475|5.0|Its filled with a bunch of awesome ideas and recipes for decorating bento boxes. It has recipes and step by step instructions for how to make certain decorations.
B00C7607FS|5.0|great movie for the kids for todays kids yip with the combo standard good to enjoy with the kids 2 see..................
B005LAII4E|5.0|you like it or you don't.<br /><br />I liked the first one and this one too. Nice set of stars and action, however character getting killed at beginning sucked..<br /><br />Thumbs up.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game- kept me engaged for a few hours... Then it ended:-( Reminded me of the Myst games. Can't wait for the next one.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Does what it is meant to do. not sure what else can be said about it.<br /><br />Good price here on Amazon compared to other local stores.<br /><br />Its a Movie you like it or you don't.
098555780X|5.0|I actually bought Vol.2 before buying this volume.  JD is first rate for teaching technique!  His videos and books are superlative and I know they will get a lot of use!<br /><br />I need to get his first book to round out my library!<br /><br />I highly recommend any of his books if you want to learn advanced parachord techniques and patterns.
B001NIA27E|4.0|you like it or you don't.<br /><br />Wife likes Pierce Brosnan that's the only reason I purchased was for her.<br /><br />Thumbs up for her.
B0014DBZT2|5.0|I've only listened to this a few times through, but like most Nick Cave work, it has its ups and downs. There are several very good songs on this album (including the title track) and I enjoyed it...nearly on par with Abattoir Blues and Push the Sky Away (my two favorite Nick Cave albums). If you're a Nick Cave fan and/or like edgy Blues, this might be for you. Recommend you preview or buy a track or two if you have the option, before buying the whole album, just to make sure Nick is right for you (he is a VERY different artist). Hope this helps, enjoy!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|you like it or you don't.<br /><br />Great Movie, loved the first one, and loved the second one. Hope for more to come with the same cast before they get to old or move on.<br /><br />Two Thumbs up.
0451232852|5.0|A fascinating read.  Follett mixes fact with fiction in a compelling manner.  You feel as though you know the characters, and can hardly wait to see what happens to them next.
0375812024|5.0|daughter loved it when she was 2-3 yrs old (still can read it to her now 3.5yrs old).  Its a childs book not sure what else to say its cute?
1419705644|3.0|I thought the Art in this book was fun to look at. My nephews found it fun to look over as well but they wouldn't read it given the encyclopedia format. I didn't care for the &#34;Hunson Abadeer&#34; authorship as it seems soooo far out of place with Adventure Time even if He is a character from the show. At best He's a minor character who only appears in about 3 or 4 episodes unless I've missed something. The humor is blah in this book. Hunson's take on the society of &#34;OOO&#34; isn't really what I'd want children reading (although it's not too far over-the-top). I don't know what the point of this book was so late into the creation of this show as literally all the information given is stuff you would already know if you've watched all the seasons. So you're not getting anything added except for a strange puzzle and a page you have to read backwards in a mirror. If it wasn't for the fact that Amazon sells it cheaper I would have never bought this full price.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Does what it is meant to do. not sure what else can be said about it.<br /><br />Good price here on Amazon compared to other local stores.<br /><br />Good movie, like the series.
B000002J6F|2.0|This was not really what I had expected and is probably my fault for not researching it better before ordering it.  It was recommended by a friend, but not comparable to my other CSN albums.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Good movie, my 3yr daughter likes it okay. and I thought it was cute also and funny. with some good actors.
B004LQI0HE|5.0|I came across this film earlier this year and fell in love with it. Although it is a very complex and dark story there is so much mystery and curiosity in the idea of possibility. It is one of my favorites films and the casting and acting is incredible. This was my first impression of Carey Mulligan (great gatsby) and she is a brilliant actress.
B007BZM3HK|4.0|Does what it is meant to do. not sure what else can be said about it.<br /><br />Good price here on Amazon compared to other local stores.<br /><br />Its a song you like it or you don't.
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|Peter Pan is one of my favorite films. This version is the only one I like after Hook with robin williams. Visually beautiful and different.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|you like it or you don't.<br /><br />Great movie to the line, I hope there is more to come. The eluding to this in the ending makes me want more and to see what tony stark comes up with next.<br /><br />Two Thumbs.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I have enjoyed this album.<br /><br />The music is fresh and intelligent.<br /><br />I know that's an odd word to use for music. What I mean by that is... this music has depth. The lyrics are thought provoking and hold much feeling. There is a refreshing difference to this group.<br /><br />I recommend this offering by The Lumineers.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Enjoyed this third book by the author.  However I did like the previous two better. Still think the kite runner is the best.  Ending of this book not as gut wrenching.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is so much you have missons so it makes the game more fun. you also have daily challenges so it never gets boring
B001CTGQBK|4.0|This movie is with no doubt a classic and a must see, really interesting! I only gave it 4 stars, because in some parts it get a kind of slow, talking about content, besides than that is a good one!
1476747016|5.0|\\"I am Pusheen the Cat\\" -- is a very adorable book!<br /> I am a HUGE fan. (o⌒．⌒o) All the images shown in the book are completely adorable and sometimes makes me wonder how Claire Belton knew I am Pusheen! L(・o・)」 *Instantly famous~*<br />I definitely recommend getting the book because it has very cute illustrations and awesome to collect.<br /><br />=＾● ⋏ ●＾= Why wouldn't you get it is the true question! (=^-ω-^=)
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Love this album! This is much better than what she is putting out these days.<br /><br />Lets get back to the sexy siren Britney who you can't help but dance to! I will always love my girl Brit Brit but gotta say this CD and the ones before it are much better than the new stuff, YAWN!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I like shows that are smart but also provide a dramatic flare that can also sate my desire for drama. This show provides intrigue, deception, romance, legal action and drama. It never gets boring, like some shows can, and each episodes leaves you interested in what will come next.
078322933X|5.0|Mark is my babydaddy so I am biased but this movie is phenomenal.<br /><br />A violent love story with Alyssa Milano and Mark Walhberg, can it get any better?! Oh yea and Reese is there too, sorry just can't get down with her, too New York prep school for me.<br /><br />Good story line, doesn't give too much background, gets right into the story. This is one I watch over and over again.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have known about this series for a long time, but never read it. Amazing book, kept me flipping pages until the end. A story that made me cry at times, and got my heart beating at others<br /> Don't miss it....read it now!
0142501123|5.0|My family has always been excited about Halloween holidays so this book was a great gift for our 4 yr old granddaughter since she just started pre-k and is learning about rhyming.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is the best game ever you should get. If you have Facebook an  your friends have  the game and Facebook you can play with THEM!!! There are many armores you can buy. Over all it is a really great game but it takes a lot of time to download but it is worth it!! :-)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|First time reading her books. What an amazing story teller. I felt as if I knew each character personally. Loved the epilogue and how she let us peak into other possibilities. Loved loved!!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Had no issues got to my home very quick no cracks or scratched on the case packed very well and I am very pleased.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have no words to describe how great this book was. Just... Wow... that's all I have to say. Everyone should read this book it's so wonderfully written, I could barely put it down.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Would have paid for it but got it as free app of the day on my kindle. I use it daily at work to qc my calculations coming out of my reporting software.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Johnson explores the unlikely yet captivating story of the Orphan Master's Son. The material, set in N. Korea, is hardly enjoyable as there is brutality and experiences that we can hardly conceive. Yet, Johnson helps us feel it - experience it. It's as if we are there. We cannot condone the actions of the Orphan Master's Son, yet we come to love him and understand his life. Having not followed N. Korea very closely, this book felt like a difficult yet somehow enjoyable journey that exposed me to some of the realities of life in this painful place. I cannot go back to ignorance. Thanks Johnson for exploring this content through fiction in a way that makes me want to know more and to do something.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|When it works it works fine. However it drops out occasionally - probably more to do with the internet connection than the device.<br />I recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy that candy crush is available on the kindle. I played it all  time on my iPhone. This makes me very happy!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I've studied science, psychology, and spirituality for over a decade.  The qualitative research I've accumulated throughout the years on an array of subjects, opinions, hypothesis and theories alike were all integrated into this one book written by Anita Moorjani.  I'm left with a sense of belonging and purpose.  The intricate details Anita shares filled me with answers I had no idea I was still seeking in my life.  In fact the book validates my understandings yet eliminates my need to understand all at the same time.  The avenue I needed to connect with who I  authentically am I found within the pages of this book,  the incredible thing about that  is I had no idea I wasn't already there.  But clearly something knew otherwise.<br /><br />Religion, dogma, and beliefs that once were so clear to me have all changed their colors within the sanctity of my mind and now hold no form, definition, or meaning as they once did.  Letting go has never been so easy to do.  Now I know and I cannot UN-know and the beauty of that fact was rediscovered, re aligned and reestablished within me.  I remember.<br /><br />Trina Taylor
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|I really enjoyed all the Iron Man movies. This one tied up some loose ends and makes me want to see the next Avengers.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|I don't understand how they continue to make money off these horrible movies.  They write this terrible script, get bad actors, a low budget, and then call it a horror film.  You sit and watch 20 minutes of dialogue just to watch a chair move or a light flicker, and people find that scary?  The only scary thing about this film is that people still pay to see it in the theater.  If you want a real paranormal movie, I would recommend Poltergeist.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00471Z3CI Poltergeist]]
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Couldn't put this book down until I was finished. I love the Pendergast character. He never fails to surprise! Preston and Child are an amazing writing team and I'm looking forward to their next collaboration. Hope I'll soon be able to read about Pendergast's next adventure on my Kindle. Keep writing!!
B00EYE0ECW|2.0|I can't get this thing to work...will probably uninstall it and just use something else. That's one thing about the Kindle I don't like, not all apps work.
0316322407|5.0|This book is one of the most amazing book by an inspirational and beautiful and strong lady of 2013 ever.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Wonderful story.  Works like any e-book should.  It's easy to read and bookmark on a kindle.  Font can be resized for easy reading.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|This CD came so fast, and was such a good price. I originally heard they were selling it at such a low price on my local modern rock station, and I knew I wanted it. There really is nothing bad to say here. It was brand new, was damaged in no way, and came so fast. Perfect &#60;3
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|at first I didn't. get it but. now I do I cant stop thinking about. it Ps. get it :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|my son asked for this for his birthday ,he is a computer Geek and loves things like this  who knows what he will ask for Christmas !

B00FI7XBIS|5.0|nice game with very smart idea I love this game and I recommended to all of you and it took my time for playing
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is fun and you get to breed and raise different dragons.this is fun.<br />You get to socialize and meet other Dragon owners and visit their islands<br />And see all kinds a different dragons.
0811874192|4.0|My wife got this and uses it for table decoration at informal parties.  It has gotten a lot of attention and positive comments.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game. I am now a bingo addict. This app is so much more enjoyable to play than some others out there. Would recommend to try it out.
B008Q00PHY|5.0|Sometimes we get tired of movies where they want us to believe that so-called good people always win or are always right. This one is different. For once the so-called bad guys win. This is a very well-made action-adventure movie from beginning to end.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It harkens back to the PC game Myst with it's puzzle solving theme. The puzzles are engaging without being too hard to figure out. The graphics are really good and the game play is very smooth without lagging or pixelization.
1439181780|5.0|This is a very inspirational tool for every day life. It's something you can pick up at any time, and make your day a better one
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very well written. Good story line. Each charater grew and the conclusion was perfect. Will be looking for more of Liane Moriarty books.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham has outdone himself with his latest book.  Not only is it the best page-turner anyone has written in years, but it also serves as a useful primer for lawyers and laymen alike on the ins and outs of estate law.  Outstanding!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|When i got this game i was amazed!,I even got to upgrade my robot!,and I get to go to a paint shop,and I got my favorite robot!,I love it,hi katelynn.Now bye!
B000G6R7B8|2.0|you have to wear it everyday or it stops, I mean you have to put it on first thing in the am. gains and loses time , the band came off several times I put it back on  except for the last time when I sent it back. I wanted an inexpensive watch and boy did I get one. I think Seiko makes a fine time piece at the higher end of the price table. as for as amazon I would give them a 5 star never had any problems with them. this is the first item I  have returned (very easy return). thank you,
B00BKTFABE|3.0|excellent and very useful for my need. recommended for anyone who does not have a camera..<br /> Fine tool for quick pics.
0345530578|5.0|As usually for me, John Grissom's books are hard to put down. He may never be considered a &#34;classics&#34; writer, but he never fails to entertain. Maybe that is what writing should be.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Great entertainment!  John Cleese and cast are hilarious.  Now I can enjoy the episodes when ever I am in the mood for classic farce.
B006CUZ7FA|5.0|The best thing about Harry Potter movies is that they support the books and make kids want to read them, so how can you go wrong. My youngest son began reading the series and watching the movies and now my older son, who never had an interest in the series is watching them as well. This movie picks up where the last one left off and is filled with great special effects, interesting characters and great pacing and suspense. Harry must learn to use his magic even as he copes with the challenges of growing up. A must see for children and young adults.
0439023521|5.0|OMG! The twists, turns, and suspense in this book are unreal. Such a book deserves special recognition. If you read any other review about The Hunger Games, they will probably agree. This story has suspense, darkness, action, and a just a hint of romance all culminated in one novel. Once you start reading, there is no going back. You will most likely breeze through this novel. You would be on chapter 5 but you will probably feel as if you have only been reading for a minute. This is a fantasy novel. However, the idea of society is pretty relevant in this book. The Hunger Games is about a girl who must overcome many obstacles and challenges in order to stay alive. That is a straight-up summary of this book. However, the ending is very interesting. This lovely novel will really make you think and infer your own ideas a lot. This review is different than all the others because I will tell you that the main character, Katniss, is strong and brave, and doesn't give a damn what the world thinks of her. She is what makes this whole story make you keep on reading. If you like people standing up for others and what they believe in, this book is a good choice. Anyone can relate to this book due to the social diversity in it. This novel is a must read! I also recommend reading the whole trilogy. You won't regret it. [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games (Book 1)]]
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|JJ abrams has done it again . star trek into darkness is better than the first film. the acting is stronger, the story is stronger. the actor who played khan was even better than Ricardo montaban. it is a truly incredible film.
B0014BY72Q|4.0|The future is all about the day you are &#34;re-newed&#34;. Just to make sure you make it to the Carousal (a stage show to kill you on your 30th Birthday) and be reborn, the Sandmen are watching. Watch for Peter Ustinov as the OLD MAN and Farrah in one of her early roles. I put this film in the same class as Soylent Green and Blade Runner for a glimpse of Mans dark view of the future.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Man of steel is by far the best film adaptation of superman ever made . Michael Shannon's portrayal of General Zod was amazing. Michale Shannon is a better zod than Tarrance stamp. Henry cavill is the best superman that Warner bros. has ever had. MAN OF STEEL is a far better adapation than superman returns. Man of steel is the best movie of 2013.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is the CD that made me fall in love with MUSE, after hearing Hysteria on the radio.  Can't miss Sunburn and Origins of Symmetry.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|My phone died one night and I had left the charger at work. This app did the wake up job perfectly! I made the setting so I had to answer 2 math problems before the alarm would go off and it made my brain start working immediately. Definitely a good download.
B0034JYC7G|5.0|Its very good earphone.comes with cable clip,and silicon buds.sound is very good.and it looks professional.would go for it again in future. especially splitting pin is perfect for use in phone.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|What a great story. I was so confused at how Follett was going to tie in all the characters, but he tied them into a big ole bow with all the twists and turns included! I couldn't believe I was actually rooting for the protagonist by the end! Follett does a spectacular job of allowing the readers to see each perspective of his characters showing all their strengths and faults making them so human I couldn't help but feel for everyone (Even the &#34;bad guy&#34;). Great book.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|Not quite as good as Virtue's Last Reward, buy it definitely still has the same feel to it. The puzzles are great and the twists in the story are memorable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, Thanks Amazon for putting this App on, I think this is one of the best games ever.......

B002VECLVY|5.0|Fashion designer Tom Ford marks his directorial debut with a compelling, visually intriguing and compassionate look at love and loss. The plot, based on the 1964 novella, A Single Man, by famous British author Christopher Isherwood, he of Berlin Stories/Cabaret, details one day in the life of a California college professor dealing with the sudden death of his long-time same-sex partner. His 24 hour odyssey, interspersed with poignant flashbacks, includes a suicide attempt, a chance encounter with a male hooker, a pivotal meet-up with a handsome male student who has his own personal agenda; and a highly emotional scene involving a beautiful short haired fox terrier named India.<br /><br />Not to be missed, it garnered several international film nominations and awards for the director and lead Colin Firth. My fave gay themed film.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. I'm glad it has a time limit :) it's a good clean game and it has so many levels!
B00942G4UA|3.0|This film is for a new generation. So much that came before addressed the same issues. Populations have continued to grow and the USA is meeting the demand for food at Americans' expense. What more can be said?
1451666179|5.0|I am familiar with Allie's blog, so I bought this book right away.  It did not disappoint.  The new material is terrific, high standard Allie material and the old material is classic stuff I can read over and over.<br /><br />I like to read anything from classics to comic books, and this fits somewhere in the middle.  One of the most hilarious and heartbreaking books you'll ever read.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I purchased this knowing what I am getting into, other people that complaining just don't understand what Chromecast actually does.<br /><br />I bought this even I own a LG smart TV (2011 version) because it gave me more option of what I can do with my TV,,,,in a much convenient way. Using the smartphone or tablet to gain control over it, I found myself always watching Youtube on the big screen. It's just so quick and easy.<br /><br />I also used the function which can mirror your chrome web browser screen to the TV, by using it that way, you can watch unsupported services through it.<br /><br />I think Google really hit a home run on the Chromecast, plus there will be much more support in the later days (even not, watching just Youtube is already enough for me,,,considering the price)<br /><br />IT IS A MUST BUY
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now I can finally have the same game level, no matter which device I am using. Now, if I could only figure out my WiFi problem,  I could sync everything up again!
B005JABU82|5.0|This product make a perfect gift during the holiday season for anyone who is a Gundam fan or even just anyone who like to put together a model.<br /><br />The kit is very detailed and specified. By detail I mean, even the fingers of the Gundam could be moved. No painting or so are needed after assemble. It would already look perfect with a few sticker<br /><br />It might had a little difficulty to stand up straight due to all the flexibility and the little heavy wings, so I used Blu Tack (just a very little) to stick it on the shelf.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product and highly recommend it. It's better to get the kids this than some video games......
B0027P2ZWC|4.0|After searching for a version that gave me just about the whole show, this is the one that I found to be the best. The singing is superb and the music is fabulous. I was a little turned off by the clapping at the end of some of the songs, but got used to it in the end.<br /><br />I did have some trouble with Windows Media Player. It put both CDs together, so the first song of disc 1 and the first song of disc 2 were next to each other. It was confusing, but I was able to fix it.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I likedthe book and was really enjoying it until it totally jumped tracks in the middle! So much so that I thought I must have accidentally skipped a chapter or two! When I finally figured it out, I didn't like it much. I like being able to tell the good guys from the bad. Overall, I was disappointed.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|My friend and I carpool all the time and sometimes are gone for hours at our jobs/classes. When we head back home both of our phones are usually dying. I wanted to find a way for both of our phones to charge. This was the perfect product. It allowed both of our phones to charge at the same time. It worked well and kept our phones alive (even when my android had my navigation app running, which can take up a lot of battery).
B0036TGT2A|5.0|The little mermaid is my favorite Disney movie ever. I'm happy to finally have it on bluray/DVD instead of my VHS.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|This is one of the best cd's I have heard in a very very very long time. So glad I took and chance and purchased it. Buy the DVD too!!
B0031RSBS2|4.0|Great stories hard to put book down once you start reading . I have read all but one of the Jack Reacher series and reding number 18 the last book in this series
B002OFWG7E|5.0|Have continually said that &#34;this group is awesome. why don't I own any of their cd's?&#34;<br />Well now I do.
1476727651|5.0|This book is a fantastic return to form by King. For a few years between Under the Dome and Joyland, I was worried about his work heading into new directions. Not that they were bad, just different from what I was hoping.<br /><br />In any case, King comes back to form and it is wonderful to follow the (mis)adventured of Danny Torrence. I cannot recommend this enough.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|What a great moment in history. So much amazing music has come from this studio. Thanks to Grohl for bringing us back to basics.
B000WH5WZE|5.0|Even though I have known about Vangelis for a short time, I am already a major fan. This album is just pure magic from start to finish, simply put. The overall ambient atmosphere generated by the ingenious sythesizer work carries the listener off into to the realms of the lonely and desolate, yet beautiful land that is Antarctica.<br /><br />Like others have said, it is hard to believe that this album was done almost exclusively with the use of electronic synthesizers. As I see it, it is the proper way to make use of such technology, unlike with that cacophonous club-dance noise that has made millions of clueless people forget that MUSIC is suppossed to actually MEAN something. It just proves that electronic music technology can be put to amazing use if it is done right, and Vangelis is a true master in that area, no questions asked.<br /><br />All that being said, I have decided to make an extra copy of this album for one of my aunts who works as a message therapist, as I think it would be perfect for her to use when treating her clients. Not to mention that all she has played lately is Enya, so this will give her clients a bit more variety when they go to see her.<br /><br />To sum it up, this is an amazing album full of rich and pure magic that is ideal for soul-piercing relaxation and easy listening... and this is coming from a die-hard heavy metal freak! Stop reading this review and buy the album already! :)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote on the go. When I need recipes I just go to Evernote and have the recipe and ingredients when I am away from home.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Besides being one of the best story tellers of his time, one of my favorite things about Sai King's novels is that he creates fresh legends that have enough in common with established lore, that they feel old or even ancient in all the right ways.  It doesn't hurt that he has 4 decades of his own work to feed on that makes you feel like you've somehow known about these monsters all along.<br />Little Danny Torrance is all grown up, and unlike the innocent boy he was in The Shining, he is fully fleshed out character with all the human flaws all King's adult characters have, but his problems are far more exotic than anything you or I have to deal with since we don't have the shine.<br />There are a few minor Dark Tower references for fans of that series. (There are other worlds than these).<br />In the tradition of his better novels, Stephen doesn't rush through this story, and I encourage younger readers to not try look at the story as an obstacle to get through to the end.  Just enjoy the ride.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I give this book four stars because of  its depth, perception, understanding and what I believe to statements of fact.  It is a story that I can embrace and wonder about. It has answered some of my questions as well.<br /><br />On the other hand I find the writing slows me down by the use of so many unfamiliar words. I often have to stop my read and look up the meanings that sometimes are still not clear for me.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to those in the biblical field and to those who are non-believers and to those who challenge and scrutinize the Bible.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Wow, this serious has been a major disappointment. Divergent was amazing but the books just went downhill from there. Without doing spoilers, I can't say much more, but what a let down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very Entertaining, i started playing it and it's almost like playing tetris. It brought me back memories, and since i enjoyed playing it while growing up, i consider Candy Crush the adult version of tetris.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is freaking hilarious. I read it on a flight and had to keep smothering snorts and belly laughs, much to the chagrin my seat neighbor. Tina Fey gives it to you straight, I highly recommend this book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm not a big game player, but I do like puzzle-type games like this. I have a hard time putting this down!! Lots of surprises different than other &quot;match three&quot; type games. Tries my patience, but love it!!
B008DVJMAW|5.0|One of my favorite cds. Rocking country music, smart and fun lyrics, good mix of slow and upbeat songs. Buy it!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is lots of fun! It helps to pass idle time! Highly recommend to those who enjoy hidden object games.
B00CABLXU8|2.0|If you're a 12 year old girl you might like this.There's really nothing new, original or exciting here. I doubt any of these songs will make it high on American sales unless it changes. There's much better pop music out there, Kesha, Pink, Miley Cyrus, the first spice girls album from 1997, Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Madonna, Rye Rye, MIA, and more. This music is very flat and boring, nothing dynamic.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!  Since purchasing RED I can't tell you how many times I've watched it. My husband also loves the action, humor and how perfectly the actor's characters mesh. It is at the same time exciting, thrilling, humorous and the whole time I'm thinking WOW!! I really like Bruce Willis as an actor and this action role is different from the Die Hard series. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOVIE!! I'm so glad that I bought it because I can watch it over and over again.
B006G2NVCA|5.0|If you are looking for a John Williams or Hans Zimmer type of score or an orchestrated score stop reading, turn away from this soundtrack and vote yes this review helped you. Also if you are wanting a similar sound to Nine Inch Nail's Ghost or a similar feel to the Social Network soundtrack or typical Nine Inch Nails you will not find it here. What you will find is one of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' greatest work! Don't come here expecting an orchestrated score, it's like walking into an Chinese restaurant and expecting Italian food. I noticed someone here buying this soundtrack and then complaining it didn't sound traditional like a John Williams score.<br /><br />This is one of the best film scores ever, I put it up there with the Blade Runner soundtrack, Taxi Driver soundtrack, and the soundtrack by Jesper Kyd to the video game Hitman Contracts. Aside from the one cover song on this everything is great. If you want a really moody Drony sounding album for a rainy or foggy day this is it! Also good for a night time drive, also good when you're really sick with a flu you can put it on headphones to zone out to. Like I said this album is extremely moody and atmospheric, if you're into that type of thing this is it! It's dark, it's disturbing, it's calming, it's methodical, dreamy, it's experimental, it's totally Trent! This soundtrack is comparable to some of the instrumentals on the Fragile and The downward spiral. Also if you're looking for an upbeat score this isn't it.<br /><br />This is an extremely generous offering being 3 CDs long. I enjoyed this much more than Hesitation Marks by Nine Inch Nails. I can't ask for more.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game kicks ass!!!  Especially for being free!  I was able to beat the game without having to pay real $$ in order to upgrade any weapons.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|Great podcast to choose from.  Would highly recommend this to any listener.  Could variety to choose from.  I love it.
B008JFUORW|5.0|The only bad part about this movie is that there won't be a part IV! That would be a pleasant surprise!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so if your a minion fan I should recamend this game because onece I got this game I fell in love with it!!!  I hope you enjoy this game!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Similar like the first two books of the trilogy, but I just hate the ending. What a way to end the book! It is like the book has been stabbed with a knife for it to have such a dreadful ending.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I bought this book on a whim - just looking for something interesting to read and I decided to give it a go based on other reviews. I found it to be a great book that I thoroughly enjoyed! I will not give away the ending, but I was very surprised where the story took me. I kept trying to figure out, along with the main character, just what was going on in this town and why he was in the predicament he was in - never would I have guessed the ending. I can tell you that this was a great read and I immediately bought Book 2 to find out more. I am now waiting for Book 3 to be released....tiny hint to the author ;o)
B008AX1HD8|5.0|First in the Harry Hole series.  Easy to read and keeps you guessing to the end. Looking forward to the next one
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Freaking amazing. Like i cried and died and I just can't even. Literally all of her books are just perfection.
B0039O8AQK|4.0|This movie is still hauntingly relevant thirty years after it was released. The story is nearly eighty years old and still holds up. The actual setting in the story is not the same, but the mind games are similar.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|great movie. seemed to drag in the beginning but after i got past it i couldn't take my eyes off it.
B000WTXCZO|4.0|This band is called the all man band, and as promised, all of its members are men.  It seems to require some sort of electronic device to listen to it, so I cannot comment on that aspect.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Rarely do I read a book after seeing a movie, but I had to read these. I needed more, more detail, more story, more of Suzanne's raw talent. Money very well spent.
6305428352|5.0|I love this movie!  You can't go wrong adding this to your collection.  It was in great condition and arrived quickly. It's also kid friendly.
B00EBDXTJG|5.0|This one feels cool cause it's from Blackened and I thought the artwork is a little bit darker but all in all it's the same masterpiece that we were listening since ages.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|This movie was just way to funny. I can remember my days in middle school watching nothing more than movies.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Not once, but several different times I had to keep myself from reading ahead. Very well thought out and written. My only complaint is that it needs to be longer! :)
B0034DGPEU|3.0|This was an entertaining book and hard for me to put down.  The soap opera quality drew me in and I really wanted to know what happened to the characters.  I would have given it an extra star were it not for the ending, which was abrupt and sloppy.  After all the detail uncovered in the book the final chapter sort of sums things by saying \\"the bad guys were gone and we all lived reasonably happily ever after\\"  I thought the ending was a huge let down.
B00G32TD98|5.0|Awesome<br />Movie!! Best horror I have seen in this year by far. Better than any horror movie and even better than insidious 2
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|No don't get me wrong.  I really do like Kahn.  He is one of the best &#34;bad guys&#34; to ever come from ST. My problem with ST:ID is that they have been there and done that.  With all the galaxy to explore how about someone\something new for a story.  The movie was good.  The cast are starting to make those iconic roles their own, the effects are great but sadly it comes down to the story and that is where the movie suffers.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|This movie is a sleeper.  When you first watch it, you will find the catch to be something you would not have considered.  I have seen this movie at least 30 times and have found some small nuance I had missed before every time I watch it.  From awe inspiring landscape to the great acting, you have the feeling that you are there.  This is not a movie that you want to miss.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie was a gift for my Fiancee for Christmas, but I watched it with her and this is a really great movie.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Veronica Roth is an amazing writer and story teller. This book, the last in the series, has some heart breaking twists but she ends the book well, leaving you wanting more. One to the best series I've ever read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally! I was waiting for this to be available on kindle. it works just as well as on my laptop. and thanks for making it free. there's not much else I want to say about it.
B007L6VR12|5.0|This movie is one of his best in my opinion. It's a charming love story and a New England nature lover's delight!
B000JSI7AI|4.0|It was a very interesting, well done movie about a tough subject to write or film about. They had a special relationship and sad it ended with a death. And the survivor being lonely.<br />Sincerely<br />Todd
B00DJYJPLO|1.0|18 years of this fairy tale romance is gone in this 3rd installment.  I am sorry I watched it, and will watch the first 2 again and again until the 3rd is erased from my mind.  All relationships do NOT dissolve into a depressing reality, there were many other ways this story could have evolved.  Bah humbug.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is fun as long as you know how to play it and you follow the directions. You also need to watch your energy levels. Without energy you can't play any levels.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the first book I've read in a long while that actually had me rushing through my daily activities just to get a chance to read it. Needless to say, I couldn't put it down.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Have watch and rewatched these episodes, enjoyed them every time.  A bit darker the the SG1 series.  A closer episode or movie would be nice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun game. Glad you don't HAVE to buy things to keep playing, hate they limit on lives, but without the limit I would never put it down
B00821OX98|1.0|Bait and switch.  Robbery.  Unfair practice.<br /><br />Getting someone enjoying a series and having it all free under the Prime membership, and then switching to pay for view is low.  I realize you have done this on a number of popular series.  Since these shows were available for free on TV, even free through the air TV, the $1.99 price each is out of line after I paid for a Prime membership, expecting to find a good selection of viewing choices.<br /><br />I am disappointed,<br />- Allen
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lots of fun and actually very challenging. I wish the instructions for the boosters were easier to get to and understand though. But overall very fun.
B00354YA4A|5.0|Very cleverly written book, really enjoyed it. McEwan is very perceptive in writing from a young females point of view. Great at getting into the minds of his characters
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The best game I have played in a long time!!!  Keep it coming!! Wish there were more games like this.
0962477060|5.0|It's easy to tell that there are a lot of various things that can be taken away from this book, and the fact that these things are explained in diagrams, pictures, AND words makes it a lot easier to take in/understand. Advanced players will most likely have the info &#34;click&#34; a little faster then those just starting out, but the more time you put into trying the theories out, the more you'll take away from this book regardless. Amazing book for the money paid!
B00BDAP66E|1.0|I got this to create a page because that's what Facebook told me to do. It won't let me create or manage any pages I admin.
B0077ATSZE|5.0|Daughter absolutely loved this movie , so I bought for one of her christmas gifts. Shipped and received within a one week period.
0007466706|5.0|It took me litterally less than a day of non stop reading! I LOVED IT SO MUCH! The only issue i had was that there wasnt another book!!!!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I love this game,it's like modern warfare...it will b better if u guys put all day weapons...but yah<br />I love this game..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've always loved candy crush. So when I saw that it was finally on my Kindle Fire HD I almost jumped out of my skin. So happy that I can play without draining the battery or my cellphone. :)
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I really enjoy this book because you really seem to understand all of the characters and their true honest feelings
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It is alright it is slow sometimes and might take some time to load but overal it is good enough for the kindle
B009APMNB0|1.0|There is not much more to say than the title of this review.  I used the ColorMunki smile to calibrate the monitor on my laptop (Ideapad Y550P) and got unacceptable colors, mostly in the form of a very significant warm/yellow cast.  I understand that colors are supposed to be slightly warmer after calibration with ColorMunki but this was too much.  Black and white photos looked tinted/sepia instead black and white.  I tried changing the backlighting type in the settings and re-running the calibration again, which is something that is recommended on X-Rite's web site, but that did not fix it unfortunately.  I am able to get much more accurate colors simply using the default Windows calibration tool so I know my monitor is able to achieve reasonably accurate colors.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I was so excited to see that Candy Crush is now available on the Kindle Fire. It worked great for awhile but now the app will not connect with Facebook. It says it is connecting. After 30 minutes I give up. I will give it a 5 star rating if I can ever get it to sync again.
0307476073|5.0|I've read this book twice now because it really touches my heart and because the Pacific Crest Trail is just up the road from where I live. Also, because Cheryl visited our city for necessary repairs. It is an easy read and keeps the reader interested, it was hard to put down.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game! It's fun for all ages! I love that your farm can keep growing as you complete tasks. Please add me to your neighbor list.  FAQJYQX.
B0049J5EOK|1.0|I tried to show it for my 1 and 3 year old nephews and it wouldn't load. was very disappointed,
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you like puzzles you'll love the room. Forces you to use your wits and your  senses.  Just when you think you've got figured out it throws you a curve.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Based on the board game. If you are a fan of the original board game or H.P. Lovecraft lore you will like this game. Its basically Yahtzee on steroids with a little more strategy involved. Excellent presentation.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book does a good job of showing that there are good people on both sides of any war, despite the propaganda!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The most unusual thing about this book was the character of Death. It was not pictured as unfeeling, rather as sad  and heavy-hearted at the job that must be done. It was enlightening to look at the war from the prospective of the ordinary German citizen, especially with the loss of life and the overwhelming destruction of Liesel's street. I liked the scenes in which Papa, Mama, and Liesel risked their lives to stand for what they believed was wrong. I thought the character of the mayor's wife and her relationship with Liesel offered such joy.
B0090SI4LU|4.0|Read the book really enjoyed it.  Great to see how well the movie was done nice job of recreating the story really enjoyed it too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game couldn't wait till I got the app. It's the first thing I do when I get up and right before I go to bed.
0439023491|5.0|Favorite book! Came in good condition. Good price versus how much it would cost in a bookstore
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Downloaded this game on a complete whim, typically not my type of game but have been completely addicted since the first time I played!
0439023513|5.0|Perfect condition and the price is unbeatable. I'll definitely order more books on Amazon. Great book, great story. Can't wait for the part 1 and part 2 of Mockingjay to come out.
B00000IZOR|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter.  Reminds me of a toy that I bought for my son 40 years ago. A very fun toy to play with and remember.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|it is hard trying to complete all the levels and every time u try to pass a level it gets harder
B007N0REX6|4.0|If you think you're never gonna hear another song from Slash that sounds like \\"it's So Easy\\", \\" Night Train\\" or maybe \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" then you're wrong. This new album boasts of songs in the same vibe and more. Slash seems to play even better and faster and more diverse too. Myles Kennedy should have accepted Slash's offer a long time ago to do the Velvet Revolver albums.He sounds awesome specially on the song \\"Far Away\\". He sounds like Ritchie Kotzen and the great late Ray Gillen ( Badlands) at the same time and his phrasing was done ala Chris Cornell. Nothing can be as good as that. Most of the songs he sings in an Axl Rose phrasing and style which is very hard to do and very much fits the songs also. When you listen to this album it almost sounds like Izzy Stradlin is in the band or maybe I'm imagining this. You almost wonder what this album will sound like if Izzy and Duff were playing. Duff is one hell of a base player. The greatness of GNR was the base was so melodic and aggressive at the same time. Anyway , buy this CD and you will not be disappointed. This kind of thing comes our way very rare. I can't pick a fave song because they all sound very good. Almost the same feeling when you first popped your Appetite For destruction tape on your boombox.<br /><br />Hey Myles.. have you ever considered singing for/with Jake E. Lee? I think you two will make one hell of a heavy blues/metal album. Dream time.
0385474547|3.0|I would not recommend this book other than to give you some idea of the primitive culture of a backward society in Nigeria<br />and it's repetitive narration of the inhabitants.
B005XLN97M|5.0|This is actually a nice size barbie doll house, not to big not to small. My daughter loves it and so does her friends.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Cannot go a day without playing. Great games that last long enough to complete. This is not just bingo games but great and fun slot games. Haven't seen any better.
0307394549|5.0|I started to bookmark recipe pages I would want to bake. Fuggedaboudit! Just start at the first one and bake your way through the whole book!
1451666179|5.0|I pre-ordered this book months ago when Allie first announced it... it showed up yesterday and I was ecstatic! The book itself is beautiful with all of the different colors, and the content is even better. There is a lot of new material that is awesome, but reading the stuff from the blog again is just as enjoyable.<br /><br />EVERYTHING IS SPIDERS
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|All of the Jack Reacher novels that I have read are just easy to power through with decent story lines. This one is no exception. The male equivalent of the romance novel so to speak.
044024238X|3.0|Ms. Kinsella writes well.  The story line is far fetched.  Definitely a good book to take to the beach and get lost in it.  If you over think a scenario, this book is not for you.  If you are looking for fluff it's perfect and fun to read.
B001NHNG64|5.0|All of the Jack Reacher novels that I have read are just easy to power through with decent story lines. This one is no exception. The male equivalent of the romance novel so to speak.
0375869026|5.0|I cried and I laughed.  When I finished this book I kept thinking about it.  This book should be mandatory for 4th and 5th graders to read.  Its about a young boy who is deformed and his experience about starting in a school.  Fantastic characters.  Families should read this book together.  I plan on re-reading it.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Action packed with a lot of funny thrown in for good measure. Loved the house party.Would watch again.I love the instant videos on Amazon.
B0089LOG02|5.0|One of the best books I've ever had the pleasure to read.  Thank you for the blessing of this book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Really excellent story with a good tie into the original &#34;Shining&#34;.  Of course, it follows up on the book version, not the movie version, so I highly recommend reading the Shining first.  That's what I did in anticipation for this sequel.  Really paid off......
B000067CPX|2.0|I suspect the CD wasn't new as advertised, because of scratches on the disc, and a lack of factory seal sticker.  However, the disc did come promptly.
B0019I6WDG|5.0|Great movie,<br />My daughters (11 and 13) and I  really enjoyed watching it together.  I did not expect it but Juno was good family movie...
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Game is really fun. I don't get bored and it keeps me coming back. Best part is being able to play with friends.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Really enjoyed the writing style. Different. I found myself rereading parts just to get the phrasing in my mind. Thought it was great
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|As a long time superhero fan, this is the movie I always hoped they would make.  If you don't like this movie, superhero movies just are not for you.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|This book is about Percy Jackson and his friends trying to solve who stole zeus`s<br /> master bolt, and if you like Greek mythology i highly recommend this to you.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|When is book 2 coming out??? :)<br />I love the original blog as well and can't wait for more!! Just know I'll be stalking the blog homepage.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|No where in stores have we yet to see this movie in 3D available.  We purchased this 3D version from Amazon and it is a legit legal copy, not burned or homemade.  Movie is great with detail and the 3d is surprisingly better than most movies that were actually made for 3d. Sound quality is much better than the original as well with more crisp sounds and deeper rich bass.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|I have 2  little girls and it was refreshing to let them watch a movie that was beyond the standard princess fare.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't put it down. Got my mom hooked. I'm competitive so I'm always going back to beat other scores!
B009ZM74F8|5.0|I truly enjoyed viewing Equilibrium. The story itself certainly has similarities with other movies of the genre, but delivers sufficiently new angles and aspects so as to make it thought-provoking and even compelling. The main characters are interesting and complex, while some supporting characters provide depth and variety. The cinematography is first rate, as are the action scenes. The textures of the various settings provide visually interesting contrasts and enhance the story without being overwhelming or being a distraction. Plot and character developments that would normally feel predictable are simply made inconsequential by the superb performances delivered by several of the actors. The movie contains more than a few violent scenes, with some being particularly violent, and thus the film may not be a good choice for more sensitive individuals, but I never felt that any of the violence was gratuitous. This film will likely deliver an enjoyable roller-coaster ride to most viewers.

B001MTENOC|5.0|Love, love, love this book and have purchased two more and now back for a third from this author. Thanks Amazon!
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I won't waste too much time on this review because I already wasted enough time trying to read the book. I made it about half way through but got so bored with the contrived and vacuous heroine (are we really supposed to believe this woman has a PhD and is capable of doing scholarly research at the Bodleian?) and the uber macho vampire hero that I just gave up.<br /><br />Yuck.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I like it but some vids i pull off youtube come out really fuzzy and others off internet the chromecast doesn't keep up with
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|I can't believe I'd only recently ever heard of this series.  I will admit that Steve throws a lot of characters at you early in the book but by not too long into the book I couldn't put it down.  My first reaction after finishing the book is to immediately start the second.  I've only had that reaction to a few series before (I.e. A song of Ice and Fire and the Mistborn Trilogy).  Can't wait to get started on the next book!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Seriously. I wish I had more friends so that I could play this more often than just at holidays and the rare get-together, late after the party has wound down. I always bring it just in case though. The game is a little expensive, but it is really well made, gorgeous and sturdy with plenty of room for expansion. The game has a little bit of a learning curve, but once you get the gist of it, you're good to go, especially if the people you are playing with are not super competitive Settlers pros.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|This is the same EXACT software as aviary. The good thing is aviary isn't available for kindle fire hd...the bad news would be, I'd have it twice...under 2 different companies...which are actually both the same entities.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Been playing this game for over a year. I've had allot of fun so far. Most of the time I play on my phone. However have found it easier to play on the kindle. You see the numbers easier & can see what puzzle pieces you need right away, instead of logging out & look into you inventory.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this book!!!  Cheryl is an amazing writer as well as inspiring.  I  have recommended this book to a lot of people.

B002SR2PKG|4.0|It by Stephen King, is a classic horror tale told in two, alternating time lines - the first in the mid-to-late 1950's, the second in the mid-1980's.  The tale focuses on a group of kids (and later adults) who discover the terrible secret behind the once-every-generation murders of children that occur in Derry Maine.  While the tale is generally well written and has wonderful characters put in tremendous scenes of horror, it suffers from the kind of weak ending and overblown climax that King occasionally falls victim to.  A great read on one hand, a bit disappointing on the other.<br /><br />For my full review go to: [...] or short link straight to the full article at: [...]
B004132I20|5.0|Love this show!!! It's smart, funny, entertaining and like nothing that's on TV right now.  Stories are interesting and the actors are fantastic. BBC really hit it out of the park with this show! Must see.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game!  It is addictive but not to the point that you HAVE to purchase more lives.  It goes quickly and is super fun.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Love this show!! What else can I say. I have turned so many of my friends on to this show. Smart, witty and....Perfect!
1594202273|4.0|Everyone should be made aware of the dangers we have and continue to face in our &#34;control&#34; of nuclear weapons.
0062278096|5.0|Loved it. Really goes into more detail that you may miss on the shows. Great pictures, I would definitely recommend it.
B008602KQI|5.0|Followed the book closely. Strongly encourage reading the book as it lets some insight into some parts of the movie that one may not catch onto. A little more visual brutality would have been nice, but as it is PG-13, it is understandable with what they had to work with. Loved the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|As stated this is the most popular game around and it's very addictive. I'm glad Amazon was able to work something out to get it on the kindle. It syncs with Facebook so you can play it across multiple platforms nonstop, Facebook, Apple, Android and any other additional android devices you have. When I run out of lives on one I go to my next device for nonstop fun.
B003LR4QPE|5.0|This set is above all else THOUGHTFUL.  The organization of the entirety of Bach's corpus of work and presentation for listening is a huge task, and it has been accomplished here with dramatic success.  The edition is grounded in Helmuth Rilling's complete recording of the Bach cantatas, which at 60 CD's accounts for over a third of the entire set.  The approach to the cantatas, as in all of the recordings supervised by Rilling, is probing and instructive.  Like Marie-Claire Alain's approach to Bach's organ music, Rilling's approach is &#34;pedagogical,&#34; leading the listener through the dramatic edifice of Bach's compositional style.  The recordings have neither the commerical glossiness of competitors, nor do they dig in with respect to stylistic turf-wars.  Forces used are not period-based, but much of the new appreciation of Bach through recent scholarship has been integrated in a musical rather than pedantic or ideological fashion.  The recordings, overall, strike me as very fresh.  There are some sonic warts-- recordings are sometimes too closely miked-- but overall the sound is very present.<br /><br />The instrumental works have been divided out to a wide range of performers, but what they all seem to have in common is a commitment to foregrounding the music and expressing a deep love for Bach.  I'm particularly fond, myself, of the Russian performers-- Koroliov for the Goldberg variations, Sitokevsky for the violin solo works, and Pergaminschikow for the cello suites.  Some will no doubt find these recordings TOO Russian; I like especially what Pergaminschikow says in his remarks on the cello suites, that he likes to think of them being played intimately, as if the performer were alone with the music.  For my, Robert Hill's recording of the Art of the Fugue is another highlight, blending insight into performance practice with a flexible approach to the music.  The organ works are designed into individual programs that are pleasant to listen to, and the chorales are organized into a multi-disc &#34;choral book&#34; in which harmonized chorales are interspersed with sacred song and organ chorales, making listenable an otherwise daunting mass of Bach's musical legacy.<br /><br />I'll be listening to this for years to come.  Having the complete corpus of work together, presented in terms of an overall vision of dedication and enthuasiasm for Bach's music gives me a sense of the whole corpus which is really sublime.<br /><br />The set itself is nicely designed, with two large booklets providing music and tract information.  The vocalists associated with individual cantatas are only listed, however, in the &#34;e-booklet&#34; versions of the liner notes available via CD-Rom.  I've found the CD-Rom, however, very pleasant to use.  Over 5000 pages of liner notes!<br /><br />The set was designed in affiliation with the Bach-Akademie in Stuttgart, and in the liner notes there are many references to publications stemming from this institution, leading the listener out into the larger world of Bach scholarship.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|The cinematography, lighting and design of this film is phenomenal. A unique science fiction story, the film's designers pushed the environments and props to lend realism and plausibility to a fantastic setting. As a lover of science fiction the strength of the visuals and the story push this film to the top of the list for me.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I kind of knew going in that the story would start off with a drunkin night out and two people who don't really know each other getting married.  Isn't that what two people who just meet do?  The story was pretty predictible and even though it was kind of entertaining the characters never really made me very interested in how it all worked out.  I rarely give up on a book so I finished it, and that was that.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lives up to all the hype I heard about it.  It's fun, challenging and addictive.  Still learning all the ins andouts of the game. There's a lot to learn, but fun along the way.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|very hard to put down. read like an action movie. a little gory at times for my taste. would recommend to friends
B003G4W49C|5.0|At first I had bought this book solely for the reason it was on the USMC private first class reading list. However I found myself enjoying the book.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|I'd really like to give this 4 1/2 stars, but can't seem to get my tablet to cooperate...smh :/...and truthfully I'm only watching this show because Mads is in it...and, Hannibal is always a creepishly, alluring subject.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|After seeing so many people posting things about this game, I had to try it! When I first looked for it for my Kindle, it wasn't available yet. It wasn't very long ago so Amazon was pretty quick about it.  This is a very fun game, very easy, and pretty fast paced. I don't like how you have to wait to continue after you get to a certain point though. I also would of liked to have the option in the beginning to be able to purchase upgrades. All in all it is very fun and I would recommend it to others.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great product and service.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I have watched this movie more times than I can remember but this 25th Anniversary is by far the Best I have seen it.  Highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Pink Floyd or who wants to experience this one of a kind movie.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I like the series....and seriously of course the author is going to continue....it is her career.  It was a fun sexy read.  Looking forward to more.  So many characters...so many stories.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When they add new stuff is going to be even better and is<br />Starting to look like the pc version every update makes it better<br />And i really recomend this game for you
0896594289|5.0|I've seen complaints about the big ugly paper sticker on the back and I was able to take it off with little issue. Here's what you do:<br /><br />Get a bottle of goo gone. Here's where you can find it on amazon: [[ASIN:B00006IBNJ Homax Oz Goo Gone GG12]]<br /><br />It's super useful stuff so it's worth buying a whole bottle of it.<br /><br />Step one: Put on some plastic gloves. Goo Gone is somewhat toxic so better safe than sorry. Soak a cotton bud or a cotton ball with goo gone.<br /><br />Step two: gently soak the label with the cotton bud/ball until it's covered in goo gone. You might have to reload the bud/ball to get the label evenly wet. DO NOT WORRY IF YOU GET GOO GONE ON THE COVER ITSELF. DESPITE MAKING IT DARKER IT /WILL/ EVAPORATE.<br /><br />Step three: Wait 10 minutes. Don't try anything before 10 minutes. you should see the goo gone working its way under the border of the sticker.<br /><br />Step four: Take a plastic shim of some sort like a plastic spoon or a guitar pick and gently and slowly work under the label. Once you have enough to grab hold of slowly peel back the sticker at a sharp backwards angle. do not pull up vertically or you might bring the cover with the sticker. If paper residue starts peeling off either use the scraper again or re-wet the area with goo gone. Slow and steady!<br /><br />Step 5: If there's any remaining residue wipe it with some more goo gone from the cotton and lightly scrape away or rub away with your finger (still wearing gloves).<br /><br />I hope that helps! It would be a damn shame if any more people ruin their books because of the publishers dumb idea to put that sticker with such strong adhesive on the back.
B00E9E4EC8|4.0|it is good but not his sty.his best is country just can,t beat his song writeing I think its the best out their
B003VANOFY|1.0|I am very disappointed in this headset, I spent 90$ On it and every 3-5 minutes it will lose connection and boot back up. It makes a low beeping noise and this repeating over and over every 5~10 minutes is very annoying. I didn't see anything bad about the headset until i had this problem myself and searched it up online. Hopefully I can return this and get something that is better. 2/10 for this headset.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Amazing. I only wish the ending had a teeny bit more to it. Whole story was so fascinating and detailed. Definitely in my top 10.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|This app is amazing! Even my downloaded music on another app goes on it so I can listen to all my music on shuffle! Get it people. It's great.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Inspiring, thought provoking, humorous read. Did Steve's reality distortion field work here? Be the best you can be and give it your all.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is fun and addicting though I don't like the constant push to buy stuff. I also dislike the time limit.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|What was a fresh concept in Divergent went off track in Insurgent, but made up for it with a shocking ending. Well, Roth stuck to that formula, except it seemed like a) Nothing happened in Allegiant and b) the entire book was merely a set up for a *shocking* and rushed ending. The plot holes were head-scratching and there wasn't enough emotion/too much repetition to build any depth.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works great on my phone and my kindle tablet fire...<br />its a great app for any device thanks it works
0316219266|5.0|This book is the story of Jeff Bezos and Amazon, from the perspective of a journalist who had plenty of access to employees and ex-employees as well as Jeff Bezos himself. The author makes clear both the faults and the successes of Bezos and Amazon, but limits the book's scope in some ways. While hinting at the devastation caused to traditional shopping (by Apple's iPod as well as Amazon's Kindle and other products), there isn't a lot of discussion here. Fair enough, as there will surely be other books about how Apple, Amazon and others have devastated local communities.<br /><br />The author also says very little about Amazon's operations outside the USA, although I found it interesting that the reason Amazon haven't yet set up in Russia (the biggest economy still without an Amazon website) is because the infrastructure is inadequate just now. Perhaps that means South Korea will be next, though it doesn't get a mention.<br /><br />Even within the main story of Amazon.com, a lot is omitted, one effect of which is the simplistic assertion that Amazon serves customers superbly while squeezing suppliers ruthlessly and expecting employees to devote themselves to Amazon without any regard for a work / family life balance. I have heard bits and pieces over the years about the way Amazon treat their employees, all of it reinforced by this book and then some. As for the author's distinction between customers and suppliers, that overlooks the fact that some customers have voluntarily contributed content to Amazon's website in the form of reviews, Listmanias, \\"So you'd like to ....\\" guides, tags, customer images and other stuff. The author occasionally mentions reviews in passing (listed in the index under customer reviews), but very few other software features are mentioned. Associates get a mention, as does Mechanical Turk (in its case, far more space than it deserves).<br /><br />Customers who have contributed such content know that Amazon's attitude towards any problems or complaints about reviews, etc. is, for the most part, far less enthusiastic than their attitude regarding any problems or complaints about orders. Occasionally, a customer may get a fantastic response to a problem or complaint about reviews, etc., but this is a comparative rarity. What Amazon seem unable to understand is that some people who have felt badly treated because of problems with reviews or other content have stopped buying from Amazon altogether. These quitters obviously don't show up in Amazon's metrics that the author sometimes mentions, but they have made themselves heard on forums and blogs. I haven't quit, nor will I, but I am only one customer - and I am addicted to reviewing. Very few customers are as addicted as I am.<br /><br />The author discusses third-party sellers originally via Auctions, then z Shops, then finally putting the option to buy from third parties in the main \\"Buy\\" box. Amazon's 1-Click option also gets discussed, but there was and is so much more to Amazon's software than this book covers.<br /><br />The author is much more interested in Amazon Web Services and Amazon Kindle, both of which get plenty of coverage, along with Amazon's battles with Google, eBay and Apple. These are not things that especially concern me (yet), but I expected them to be discussed and they are interesting.<br /><br />Amazon's quest to become an everything store carries dangers that the author does not mention. I remember that when Woolworth UK went bust, it was reported that the problem was that it lacked focus. In other words, it was a victim of the very diversity that had made it successful originally. Amazon's retailing diversity is already far greater than any brick-and-mortar retailer ever was, and it has also branched into other areas such as Amazon Web Services and Amazon Kindle, with the likelihood of more to come. The internet world is still young and none of us can predict the future, but it will be interesting.<br /><br />My first impressions of Amazon were very positive, but over the years I have learned to be more critical. This book reinforces my misgivings. Despite Amazon's diverse product range, I prefer to buy locally where possible even if the price is a little higher (it's sometimes lower). The devastation caused by Apple, Amazon and others is clear for all to see, and while acknowledging that my reviews may contribute, I know that some other customers also use Amazon reviews but sometimes buy locally.<br /><br />I have been hoping for many years that a customer would write a book about Amazon from the perspective of a reviewer or other contributor of content. So far, no such book has been written, but I have a feeling that 2014 may be that year.<br /><br />So this book is fantastic in so many ways in describing Amazon's history from a business perspective, and also plenty of information about Jeff Bezos, even mentioning his e-mail address. I won't be using that again, although I used to use it occasionally a few years ago. When I last mentioned it on a forum, my post was replaced by the message \\"Deleted by Amazon\\".<br /><br />Meanwhile, although this book misses out a lot, it is brilliant at those aspects that it covers. For anybody who is interested in the history of Amazon and Jeff Bezos, this book is well worth reading.ons of Amazon were very positive, but over the years I have learned to be more critical.

B007L5LD9O|4.0|Gwyneth is great as Emma, Jeremy Northam is great as Mr. Knightley and Toni Collette plays Harriet Smith very well as an unsophisticated girl taken under a &#34;superior's&#34; wing.
B002U3CCF6|4.0|I enjoyed this book but not as much as Gone Girl . I anticipated the denouement fairly early on.The writing is well paced however, the characters a were somewhat unbelievable. I felt that  that they were a bit like psych text book profiles.
B00DJZR46G|3.0|An album from the most accomplished musician -  songwriter of all time is always worth a listen.  This album is most certainly.  Be aware this effort takes work to like.  That is, you must listen several times to appreciate the complex chord structures.  They are far from pop candy, or easy hooks that will grab you. They do grow on you... to a point.  My first listen revealed below average vocals, limited range with poor phrasing, combined with confusing melodic themes going nowhere.<br />  While the melodies clear up and are actually pleasing in time, you are left with a work of compromised, scratchy vocals with restricted range, and songs crafted to accommodate unfortunate limitations. The sparse arrangements are over embellished or weighted with piano and lack the simple understated presentation of his early work.  A little mix of trying too hard and forced musical expression  make up for a loss of chops these days.<br />  Taupin's words are less ambiguous than his usual, and more story telling than lyrical.  He's not running out of things to say, and lyrics are not the problem here.  There is just an emphasis on interesting stories rather than art.<br />  I have enjoyed the album, and have accepted the new (or current) Elton for what he is, and appreciate that. The vocals on Voyeur are notably well done.  Home Again also stands out as a nicely crafted song.  The criticism is merely to reference this with his previous offerings.  There is a great variety of opinions on this album, largely because it is different than earlier work.  Is it fair to ask a \\"sixty something\\" to write rock songs?  I don't think so.  It's a must purchase for an EJ fan, I'm not so sure after that.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a must read for all middle school children to understand  that you can never judge someone  by their appearances.  Auggie showed such great character just being himself and forgiving  those that made fun of  him in  the  beginning  and never  gave up in school .  He taught everyone around him what Is important  in life and how to be a strong person even when no one  seems to be  on your side!
1451666179|5.0|Thank you.  Thank you SO MUCH for making this!  I need to ration out the chapters so I do not over-indulge in this goodness!  You are fantastic, and I want you to continue to write and draw pictures.  I will now be purchasing more for out of town family.  There will be copies in every house by christmas.  Thank you again.  The world needed this book.
0553106635|4.0|The book is great. I just wish they were clearer as to which version it is (the version I got was not the one shown in picture)...i know it is not a big deal, yet that's what I was expecting. Otherwise, book was in a better-then-expected condition.
075669812X|5.0|My son lives this book, especially the pages that shows all of the mini-figures. He also loves the exclusive minifigure. This book is definitely one older Lego fans would enjoy too.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|This is a great gift idea -- I'm very excited to give it to the person for Christmas! I highly recommend getting the combo.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was waiting to get the app for Kindle I love this handsome levels are easy and some are hard and takes day's to complete. Great game
B000022TSW|5.0|Great movie -- must see and it's possibly one of the greatest satire series ever created. Must have an open sense of humor to enjoy this movie/show and be a little up to date on when the current events/past events had happened -- most jokes have to do with something in the news.
B0089LOG02|4.0|yes, could have been better written....yes, had a neatly wrapped up ending (these are some comments from my book club).  But it was something we had no knowledge of ever happening and I thought it was a good story overall.
1423113497|5.0|Rick Riordan series have been a pleasure -- I highly recommend this series and the heroes of olympus series as well (very good series to snatch up).
B003B02PEU|4.0|The Last Juror is entertaining and takes an unexpected twist at the end. It is a typical Grisham novel. I read his work for entertainment. I enjoy his characters, though some are cardboard cutouts. Usually, he gives them enough quirks and idiosyncracies to make them interesting. His best novel is still, A Time to Kill.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great gift idea -- couldn't be happier with the whole set on blu ray -- must have for Rocky fans.

No. If you're a old time comic fan with a penchant for space-opera theatrics and awesome visuals...go see it in the theater and then buy it to see it again and again.
B00ELCZSS2|5.0|Had 2 awesome singles and the rest of the album is just filled with some great bonus tracks. You should get this.

B0064MGU98|5.0|I watched the first episode as a freebie on iTunes.  Hooked.  That's all there is - hooked.  You won't be disappointed in this first season.  The second isn't my favorite but has a few surprises.  This first season though - you'll love.  Try it - but be warned. You'll spend the next several days watching it all.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Ram Mounts. Two words, nothing to add......Just Ram mounts...say no more!
B005HEFB6M|4.0|I'm a fan of Star Trek - I'll admit it.  But this series isn't my favorite.  There are bits I enjoy: T'Pol's snark - very un-Vulcan, Tucker's inability to stay out of trouble.  But, whoever thought of that theme song should be shot.  Every time we watch it have to comment to my husband &#34;I hate this song&#34; - it's become a running gag. The adventures, not bad. The acting, not bad. When there's nothing on the 800+ channels of TV, we tune in to this.
B00C2IN76C|5.0|Is not really too different, but just enough to add enjoyment to the first pass... as a fan, definitivelly a must have
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Well written, very informative about a part of the world I had known very little about. Wrenching in places. Very glad I read this book.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|One of Stephen King's best in years. Couldn't put it down. The Master of Macabre returns with a vengeance! Highly recommended to any fans of Stephen King or horror fiction in general.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I have been wanting to read up on Tesla for a while now and finally got around to it. I honestly tuned out most of the self help stuff (not that it wasn't encouraging and I'm sure it's inspirational and helpful to people) but I was more intrigued by the info presented on Tesla. What an amazing example of the potential we all have to think outside the proverbial box. How unfortunate that he was not always seen as the great man he was. Thank you for your research and the time you put into this book, I really appreciate it!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good story line, thought it would be different.. Hard to read author from Australia wording  language difference.  Not sure if I would read anything else from this author..
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of the trilogy! I see many reviews saying this book was a disappointment which I didn't think! It had some plot holes, but what book doesn't? It was much like The Hunger Games Trilogy, as the last book is more complex. But they talked about serums much more and it was a bit annoying! But it is overall a touching a story, GET IT NOW!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game now I can play against my friends on my Kindle HD.  I never understood why you would sell all the cheat books and not the game.. So a big Thank You for bringing it back...
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I especially like being able to schedule my whole week and then not worry about it. Different days, different schedules are no problems. It's all done in a convenient and pleasing way. Nicely done.
B004J4WLB4|1.0|This is the first book I've read that I did not find anything to like about the main character. The book switched back and forth so often between time frames that I found the story line difficult to follow. Would not recommend this book to anyone.
0199535639|5.0|Interesting portrayal of gender roles. A great mystery story, good characters. The author, Collins, is a master at his craft, and knows just how to manipulate his audience's emotions. Very well written and captivating.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|If you are a fan of Jane Austen, particularly Pride and Prejudice, this is something you must see!  It's great fun and acted so well!
B00DZJ82TY|5.0|I listened to this while writing term papers as a freshman in college.  Normally I can't listen to music & concentrate at the same time but this was different.  It helped me focus & relaxed me.  Van helped me make the dean's list that year.  Thanks, Van.  I also listened to His Band and the Street Choir, Common One, Beautiful Vision, No Guru No Method No Teacher & Inarticulate Speech of the Heart.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Book was entertaining, but at the end I was left feeling incomplete,  also, the series as a whole was a bit more romance than necessary.  It seemed to be unclear if romance or sci-fi action was the man story board.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Really like the graphics. Wish we had a little more time to search. I like the way the items we search for are hidden in the pictures. Makes it harder to find them
B007D2XSW0|2.0|This app kept crashing my phone and I had trouble saving anything. Guess that is what you get with a free app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is very challenging.  It really makes you think about what moves you want to make next. Makes you use your brain.
B00CEK9OTM|3.0|Got this as the free app and it was kind of fun. I only played it a few times before I uninstalled it.
B00E7NIMZ6|5.0|Hans Zimmer's association with this film was one of the main reasons I went to see it. His score for this movie captures the intense and widely varying emotions of the main characters perfectly. The string themes display the tension between the two drivers, while Hans' skillful use of base and electric guitars (along with the smooth hum of a formula 1 engine) take the listener right into the cockpit with Hunt and Lauda. Hans' inclusion of 4 popular songs from the 1976 period (all of which are in the film) is appropriate, but sometimes distracting from the story his themes are trying to tell. That said, this album is like a musical roller-coaster, and I highly recommend you take the ride, you won't be disappointed.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was so much better than I thought it was going to be. My boys had a great time watching and rewatching this movie. The adults actually enjoyed it too!
0385349831|2.0|I am a huge fan of Paulo Coelho.  I have read almost the entire collection and his amazing biography - Paulo Coelho: A Warrior's Life (and wow what a life he has lived!)  He's given us so very, very much that I shouldn't complain...<br /><br />But, I can not say that this book is one that I'd recommend.  There were good moments and lessons, as he will always give.  But he always does so much better that you can actually just skip this one and make sure you've read the others.<br /><br />I have faith in Paulo Coelho, so I know he will be back in spectacular form soon enough.  I am very grateful for all that he's given us, so I just can't give it a one star.
B006LSZECO|3.0|First half very tedious.  Excessive use of f.... word.  How did Amy have a car without a license plate trail?
B008C20TDG|5.0|I expected results...Did not plan on permanent changes in eating habits that had been set for 50 years! As someone who prefers science overly hype, I liked how this book presented sound reasoning and evidence  for its suggestions. This is a must read for everyone!
B00FPH51LQ|4.0|I was expecting to cut this off after 20 minutes before I started watching it. It was a fun movie, actors played their parts well, and it had a fun vibe.  I can see some might hate it, so borrow it or rent it. I don't see owning a copy, but definitely glad I watched it.  Both main characters played their parts well and I liked them in the movie, and Kevin and Mary fit well too.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is home. It's so very obvious that the author is back on familiar roads and comfortable paths as he brings a great story in Sycamore Row. The interesting setting of just a few years after the Carl Lee Hailey verdict gives Grisham fans hope that we can look forward to more stories of Jake, Harry Rex and Lucien.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|It's a cute game for when you're bored and sitting in a doctors office. Though it does get boring after awhile.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Loved it, both for the opportunity to easily revisit some of my favorite old posts and for the incredible new entries. As expected, Allie did a fantastic job!
B004LROUNG|5.0|I haven't read a fiction book in years.  This book renewed my interest in reading.  Read the book in 4 days. Which is very fast for me.  It is a page turner.  I liked it a lot.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|AS A BIOLOGIST, I LOVED THE REFERENCES TO BOTANY AND THE LIFE OF THE MOSS.  SHE CAPTURED ME WITH THER CHARACTERS.  I TRULY ENJOYED THE BOOK.
B00G32MPWU|2.0|Director over killed the special effect. Every scene had the same slow motion, time frame low camera shot.  I should have waited till it was on prime movies, was not worth the $3.99 rental.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. The Shinning was my introduction to King and the reason I am a \\"constant reader\\". My curiosity of Danny's continuing story and my confidence in the authors love of his characters was why I made the purchase. As King says sequels are not always up to test. In this regard it was and what a great ride.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I was so happy I had received a gift card for Amazon at the same time season six was released.  I can't seem to get enough of these guys.  Top notch!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this so much! We use it a lot. So useful, great ideas, & for sharing with other people.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a great book to read. It has a variety of different life styles and issues encountered in family and relationships and their challenges and fears. When I first started reading the book I didn't think I would be too interested but as I continue reading It made me want to read it over and over again....I just love reading this book.  Mildred McConnell
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Enjoyed this book so much!  Enjoyable easy read.. Get ready for the water works at the end.  Can't wait for the movie!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Really disappointed.  The story just dragged on and on.  I enjoyed the first 2 books, and this was the least favor of the 3 by far.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing Candy Crush and was so bummed that there wasn't a Kindle edition. But after months of waiting, it's here! This is the real, legit version. Not a fake one :) Syncs with FB
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I usually enjoy Grisham's books, but this was special.  I am a lawyer that does a lot of probate work.  Grisham masterly combined the machinations of probate with history and brings it all to life.  Could not put the book down.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I play a lot of different games from MMO's to Sandbox type games and everything in between. I had been using a logitech mouse until recently and I wanted something different. I decided to try the Anker 8000 DPI High Precision Laser Gaming Mouse because it was a very good price and seemed to have all the functions of the higher priced mice. I checked reviews and the general public seemed to like it also. I have now been using this mouse for 3 months and I am finding that I love it. It is simple to set up and works like a charm. I never experience any lag with it, It glides across most surfaces with ease so even if my mouse pad has gone MIA i can still use the mouse. All the buttons are easy to reach without having to search for them they advertise that it 'fits like a glove' and I can say it really does, I have not experienced any wrist fatigue during long hours of gaming. Over all I love this mouse and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good well priced gaming mouse.<br /><br />Update: It must be a very highly praised item because I was flying home from a vacation over and it was stolen from my luggage.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|BB use to be fun but now it seems like all they care about is having you buy credits or coins. If they are going to make it so difficult to complete rooms they should give you more daily credits.
0385342071|5.0|It makes a hopeless sucker out of you. You want to keep reading and when it's finally over, you would wish it weren't.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy Candy Crush with its different levels. It is a game that the next level can be reached without costing money.
0812993845|4.0|This book is full of drama. It has a combination of romance, love, and comedy to it. It also has  points in a relationship that a lot of women can relate to.
B009GX69RK|4.0|These characters are ridiculous at times with some oddly realistic moments.  A good lighthearted show to watch before going to bed.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|Have used TA for years. Generally on the mark if there are enough reviews. Need to read the reviews to assessed the comments.
1934030198|4.0|This is a very detailed training guide. As a competitive age grouper, I still wasn't ready to dive into all the details of this book.  Maybe an off season purchase. It is also useful in parts. As a whole, it's very overwhelming.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Sound of Music has always been my favorite movie.  Julie Andrews is the greatest, and can sing a phone book.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|Rented this to watch with my kids at Easter time.  They were totally engaged and talked about the movie after.
1451648545|5.0|I listened to the book-on-tape before I read it. I recommend reading it more than listening. It is the model of what a book like this should be, and I'm guessing Jobs would have considered himself right once again in his instinct for who should take it on. It gives the details you need, int he order you need them; is interesting without being gossipy and clear and detailed without being dry; has focus and very clear organization; repeats just as much s necessary where necessary to remind us of what we've heard, and never resorts to cheap tension-building devices like excessive foreshadowing. And that's not even dealing with the subject - one of the key people in the development of our modern world, somebody genuinely worth writing about and reading about. Thirty years from now no one will care about the biographies of Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos or Zuckerberg et al. But they'll care about Jobs, because he matters in a way few individuals ever do.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The story has taken a turn away from some of the main characters by adding more characters, at times it seems a little long winded.  It's still good reading.  Book two was the one I enjoyed the most...
B0084AZXKK|3.0|Well just so you guys know I'm Italian and my 3rd language is English, I haven't been learning it in school but here in the US. So this is not an easy read for somebody like me. This is probably old English and unfortunately I understand only 50% haha . I should probable go to school haha
1936719010|3.0|Well, they are words of wisdome, huge ones. It is like a children's book with a very few large words per page. I guess I was expecting a little more of an involved read?
B00F9040HU|1.0|Although I liked the game very much it only allowed me to play a limited amount of levels before locking me out.  I thought it was a &#34;FREE&#34; game.
B008XG1X18|4.0|it is better than facebook. I am able to find what I need. Also it has helpful information on the site.
0307476073|5.0|I just finished \\"Wild\\" and am going through withdrawal.  I wanted Cheryl to keep going.  I wanted her to hike up to Canada.  But then I would want her to circumnavigate the globe.  I just enjoyed this book so much, I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />\\"Wild\\" is not a travelogue.  Strayed barely acknowledges the scenery she passes (pictures would have been nice!) and knows little about nature or  long-distance hiking.  What she does know, or comes to know, is herself.  She finds redemption for a life of poor choices through honesty with herself and the reader, creating a new identity of self-respect through the rigors of discipline.  Some of her misadventures are hilarious, some frightening, with formidable will, grit and determination she pulls on her boots and carries on.  In many ways, Strayed is an everywoman.......we all suffer losses, have our pride and our shame, we all try to do better.  By the end of the book, I felt her triumph almost as if it were my own.  And indeed, I have felt braver, stronger, through the influence of this book.<br /><br />Strayed's engaging voice, self-mocking humor, refreshing candor, courage and indominable spirit made every step a delight and inspiration for this reader.  Best to you, Queen of the PCT!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I kept reading because I had no idea which way the plot would turn next.  Very different from other books I have read recently.
B00417HV14|5.0|Great guitar player!  He does well on vocals too and the overall performance is excellent.  The video and sound quality of this disc is great.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very entertaining novel;  I truly believe this is how the movie should have been made; now I'll have to watch the movie to see for myself what I'm talking about
B000FCKL6G|5.0|For those whose industries are going through a lot of changes/ are working for behemoths where change is the new way.. it's a great read. It's just awesome to see that a book written so long ago still stays relevant..
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|I discovered Bastille when they had only their EP Haunt.  This album is an incredible and satisfying followup.  These are just great songs to sing along to, dance to, do whatever you can imagine to.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|The world of fantasy titles is often a mixed bag. Yet Rothfuss manages to deliver a sharp interesting world without overdoing exposition and history. Endearing characters and challenging settings keep you turning the pages. I wonderful read and one that I started again almost no sooner then finishing the first time.
B00G32OER4|5.0|One of the better supernatural movies I have seen in years .. Keep you on your toes the whole time ..
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book sucks!!!  I can't believe that anyone could read this. It stinks it stupid it's horrible  and I'm not a nerd so shut up.
B003YMNVCA|4.0|The authors of this book have sold me ever addition they have published and a couple twice (I wore them out). As a systems administrator everything I need and use is available on the web or in the man pages so you would think that this representation of information wouldn’t be worth the price of the book (ebook this time). Surprisingly the repackaging and organizing by administration concepts keeps this book my go to documentation on at least a weekly basis. Many times I am just doing things I have done many times before a quick peak to sort out the differences in distributions or ps commands options it is explained here in usable language as in more computer less science. That brings me to what this isn’t it isn’t a text for people that are not using Linux and Unix as industrial tools for themselves or their organization this is an instruction manual.<br /><br />Keep your up time high and load average low,<br />Rich
1475143389|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's a little repetitive in the beginning, but it starts focusing in on things fairly quickly. I've been changing my diet and workout habits around based on some things I learned while reading and I have started to notice a difference both in my energy levels and aesthetics.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|what a great collection. has so much great stuff in it. great music, any beatles fan cant go without ths.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved this book and will remember it for the duration.  I couldn't put it down.  However, I thought it was a bit medically wordy for the general public.  His explanations could have been shorter and simpler.  I am in the medical field so I understood them, but, thought many of them were not necessary.  It made the book somewhat heavy to read.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Well.....all I can say is the graphics are awesome- but the story line not so much. I found it predictable.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I love love  Love these books but I also love happy endings. I.feel.like she didn't give  you  happy ending just because  you kind.of get one in the hunger games. I would still read anything she puts out but I wish she  would publish an alternate endings well.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|It just goes on and on with the same rhetoric. I wanted to know more about the physical involvement and less about Christians back muscles.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It does have a few tense moments but very simple writing, a few ridiculous premises and poorly planned pacing make it little more than morning commute light-reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a very good game and I think that everyone should play it. It's really fun. Bye!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Hope the movie is better than half as good as this book, because this book, while a bit unbelievable was still very good
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is entertaining and a challenge to play. The levels grow increasingly complex. It is very fun to try to figure out what move to make next. Don't start playing if you only have a few minutes. It will draw you in and you will not want to quit.
B00ARN0ZF0|2.0|Number 4 should be the last in the series as they basically reworked 1 through 3 into a pretty boring effort.
1594135851|5.0|Ordered this book as required reading for my son's school.  Did not read it myself, but when I asked him he said he really enjoyed the book a lot.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Case fits perfectly and is tough as nails. Case has built in bumper so screen doesn't touch surface when face down on a table. Easily the best case for the money.
159413586X|5.0|Ordered this book as required reading for my son's school.  Did not read it myself, but when I asked him he said he really enjoyed the book a lot.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like the mix of hidden objects and other puzzles and that you unlock more things by playing. Even though you find things on the same screens repeatedly, the items change and move enough to keep it interesting, plus sometimes you find them by word or shadow or with a flashlight or by a subtle image shift - possibly other ways too but that is as far as I have gotten.
B000JIJPZY|5.0|This gym kept my grand child entertain and happy.  Fisher price always makes they products to high standards.  I highly recommend.
B001DJLCRC|1.0|What a screw-up not to have closed captioning in English!  5 star show (don't get censored AMZ download), but 1 star for leaving out the CC.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Must see!! This season was better than the first. Claire Danes is an amazing actress. I recommend this to anyone.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I mean it's kind of stupid but so well done. Cool song, great graphics. Cracks me up that it's sponsored by a train authority.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its a great way to wile away few minutes, or hours. No kidding, quite addicting. I'm always l pushing to beat my last score, my record.
B00E9ZFIMM|4.0|A very simple app with a lot options anyone getting old should get this app....I lent to say young. No offense
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this game. It was like taking care of a real horse and was very kid friendly. I loved it. It was very fun and even slightly addicting.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|EXCELLENT
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I started this series with great hope, hoping to read them before the inevitable movie premiered, and hope that it would be a good read. I finished them before the movie, but unfortunately I was disappointed from the beginning with the content. If you must read this series, practice your speed reading first - you will need it to get through the terribly written and trite monotony that begins at the end of the first book. And it only gets worse.<br /><br />When I finished the second book I was skimming through everything that wasn't dialog. Her repeated use of every descriptive term, her lack of character voice, or any real development left me only wanting to know what happened next and preferring my imagination filled in the why. My skimming continued through this third book.<br /><br />Roth's choice to write each chapter from different and alternating perspectives of her main characters only served to confuse me while trudging through her useless descriptions and supposed insight into the characters. The only way I was able to differentiate the perspectives was with the helpful title of each chapter.<br /><br />Roth's wonderful idea behind a class system is wasted on her own terrible writing. If you are considering reading these, be prepared for a difficult task. I advise you wait for the movie.
B00C6B9XCW|5.0|I must say that Michael Cera is far from an action star but however he plays the part of Scott Pilgrim really well. The movie was full of humor and action sequences that will keep your attention throughout the movie. This is definitely a Blu Ray you have to have in your collection.
B00009AOBI|5.0|I have this move in VHS and have really missed watching it.  Now I can watch it whenever I want.  It came quickly and was packaged very well
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game was fun and entertaining. I was stuck a couple of times but as you learn what to lock for it is solvable.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is an amazing artist, the mix of techno sound with the classical feel of a violin is an amazing juxtaposition that should be appreciated. This album has my all time favorite song of hers \\"Crystalize\\" which has a must see video. But all of her songs are done just as well. The only way this can be rated other than five stars is if you are of the Justin Bieber, Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus liking group in which case I'm sorry you do not appreciate well made music with an artist who has true talent.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Elliot Smith has written and performed some of the best music. He is reminiscent of the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Joan Baez in his lyric maturity and musical expertise. ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL TIME!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|As with the first installment, I was not sure I would really get into the story,but I did. Unfortunately it is now becoming predictable. While everyone likes a happy ending, I am hoping for plausible from the final book. Obviously over all good enough to get me to buy all three books. HA!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Graeme Simson has created quirky, engaging characters for a laugh-out-loud romantic comedy. Almost impossible to put down until the very end.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|While not as focused as his other works, Malcolm Gladwell's latest book offers readers some insight into how to overcome perceived inferiority, and inspiring stories in which it occurs.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game and I'm addicted to it. I think its even better than Fruit Ninja and its pure fun.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|I watched this actual unrated version and was so appalled at how terrible this movie is that I had to write a review right away to save others the grief of watching this wretched wreck.<br />First of all, have never watched the other movies in the series but if it is anything like this, I will avoid them like the plague. My review is basically a review of this movies entertainment value of which it has none.<br />The use of documentary style camera with dates is totally useless in this movie. You are made to think that this movie shows captured images from paranormal activity investigator cameras. But it doesn't work because this movie is not about a paranormal activity being investigated by professional investigators. They do not exist in this movie. So why do they even bother with this effect?<br />This movie is basically a mishmash of events that do not help to move the story (if you can call it that) along. The plot plods along with no real build up that you come to expect with horror movies. This movie could have been encapsulated in a fifteen minute span and still get the same result.<br />This movie is actually boring and I kept on watching it as I waited for it to get better. And it never did. The disappointing ending which I thought did not make sense. It was simply thrown in for sudden shock effect which did not work because of the lack of build up. This reminds me of something right out of a YouTube video that will pop off a sudden growling monster out of nowhere just for a laugh. It's not scary. It's just shocking. But in this movie's case, it is just totally disappointing.<br />I get the sense that this movie was a simple cash-in on the movie series. I don't know if this movie was shown in theaters but if it was, I can only imagine how angry the movie goer must have felt after sitting through this garbage. I am glad that I did not purchase the dvd version of this movie and simply watched it on Netflix. I could have written a much better movie to call Paranormal Activity 4 than this. Even a schoolchildren can make a more entertaining movie than this. Avoid this movie at all cost.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to start on book 3. It's hard to put down once you start. Can't wait to see how the story ends. Will katniss be with Gale or peeta in the end?
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Love this thing-  works well on my Kindle for jotting down ideas while I'm reading - makes it alot easier than dragging out the laptop just to jot some thoughts.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Childish the beast of these things are you doing right now I'm going to sleep now good dictionary definition magazine and I have to sleep now I'm going to sleep now I'm going to sleep now I'm going to sleep now I'm going to sleep now I'm going to sleep now I'm
B008XG1X18|1.0|I can never get the program that I click on.  I would like to get some information on how to make them
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|What better combination than that?  This game is addictive but coupled with Star Wars it is like being addicted on...  Awesome!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I need some instructions.  I am at a level now that I have no idea what I am supposed to do.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Since we no longer have Breaking Bad, it is currently better!  Once you start watching this series, you won't want it to end!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Bought this mic to record my neighbors while they were having sex. The mic cord was long enough without having to purchase an extended audio cable. I'm getting crystal clear audio from where I placed the mic. I look one star off though because the mic is a decent size and I'm afraid they might soon discover the mic. Until then, check my podcast for updates.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Alan Jackson has outdone himself with this passionate statement about his love for &#34;Down Home&#34; music.<br />Very enjoyable and great musicianship from all.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|All of the books that I buy for my Kindle, I have enjoyed immensly. Usually, Amazon recommends books that have familar names and I appreciate all that they recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|On their games where you get all the ingredients to the bottom...you have to have them on the board to do that ! Some of the games never even release them all before the moves. are used up!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was hesitant at first, but drawn in to the true story as most people would be because of the subject matter, Very good book and very well written
B008PZZYB2|2.0|This was not the best movie I have ever watched. Some parts were funny, while other parts were not that great.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I was hooked on the book because it compared 2 different cultures and it gave rise to emotions that everyone could relate to.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Awesome book. An &#34;almost&#34; sequel to The Shining. Very hard to put down and wish there was more of it to read!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is very addicted!!!!!  I like you can play with your friends and family. Good luck and enjoy the app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicted game.  It gets more and more challenging.  One thing I don't like are the timeouts you have to take.  It would be more enjoyabe to me to play as I have the time.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|One of my favorite horror movies. Great quality Blue-ray, arrived on time and in perfect condition. Great young actors make this remake better than the original.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a cute game.It is so addicting. I always find myself playing it.I love his game and I love monions
1401308201|5.0|This was a birthday gift for a Wicked loving friend, but I had to read it before I wrapped it!
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|Decent album, and has many reminders of the sounds of Funeral, Neon Bible, and The Suburbs. Doesn't quite hit the magic that came with Funeral or The Suburbs, but AF took a big step in another direction with Reflektor.
0345803507|4.0|A easy read when you don't want to think. The author seemed to run out of ideas by the third book but it was worth finishing the series.

0446554995|5.0|Typical P&C novel. A good follow up on theme.The process was easy and as usual very prompt and accurate Good work JC
B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|Although more mainstream than it's predecessor, it still is refreshing and creative!<br /><br />The stand out tracks, in my opinion, are the Intro, I Stand Alone, Let it Ride, Trust, and Jesus Children.  I would go into further detail, but don't want to spoil anything for anyone.<br /><br />The band and features performed spectacularly as to be expected, but Mark Colenburg, the drummer, almost stole the show from the guest vocalists and Robert Glasper himself! Especially on Let It Ride; I was awe struck. I thought I'd miss the smoothness of Chris \\"Daddy\\" Dave's groove, but Colenburg does a remarkable job on this album.<br /><br />Robert has a particular chord progression that he seems to favor and build on throughout the album. It's amazing how he can make so many different variations of this progression which leads to an effect that stirs the soul; Especially on the slower tracks.<br /><br />The only criticism that I have is that the majority of the tracks seemed like a Glasper and Colenburg duo. I don't recall Hodge getting a chance to showcase his talents in a solo, or get a stand out performance on any given track. I believe he had a short riff, but it was so short I do not even recall the track.  Benjamin had his standout performances on the Intro and Lovely Day on the Deluxe Edition of the album. On Black Radio everyone in the band had a chance to showcase their talents and it blended in with the guest vocalists better than on Black Radio 2.<br /><br />Other than that minor criticism, the album is still excellent and worth many listens!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The whole family is playing this one. It is like a lot of other on line games we have grown up with , but it is fun when so many are competing.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|There are so many characters to portray, this book seems to start slow, even a little confusing.  As we come to understand the various characters, this book becomes very difficult to put down. This is vintage Stephen King which I fully recommend.  In fact, I am envious that anyone that hasn't read this book has the opportunity yet to indulge in some pure reading enjoyment.

B009OYTIXS|3.0|A reasonably well written show with above average production values. I am not overly familiar with the original comic book, so I am unable to compare. Nonetheless, I do enjoy the \\"dark knight\\" flavor of the show. The interweaving of various levels of \\"the Arrow's\\" story is adeptly handled.<br /><br />One caveat: the writers often take political correctness to new heights of absurdity. In fact, it seems they are wholeheartedly committed to selective unreality in the midst of their \\"gritty realism\\". The most glaring example is how the physical disparity between the sexes are conveniently ignored in the many fight scenes.<br /><br />No matter how much bigger the man is, or more highly skilled, he can only fight a woman to a draw. Men, of course, can easily be knocked out, and at times even effortlessly killed by women. In fact, if I am not mistaken nearly all those killed on the show are men. (Because, well, men are easily dispensed of, and even suggesting relative female weakness is, of course, misogynistic).<br /><br />When it comes to man to man fighting, there is a least some *basic* sense of realism maintained i.e., the bigger, stronger, more clever and more highly skilled combatant will win. Not so if a woman is involved. Pay particular attention to the Arrow vs. The Huntress. There is NO POSSIBLE WAY she could compete with his upper body strength and skill. Yet they always fight to a draw. She also catches--yes, actually catches--his arrow when he tries to shoot her. A feat that no man, of the countless many the Arrow kills (yes, other than his arch-nemesis) is ever shown to be remotely capable of.<br /><br />You may say that I am nitpicking and that this is \\"only a TV show\\". Funny how this is *never* the case if even the faintest whiff of putative sexism is believed to be involved. Then a simple TV show is not just a TV show, but is an ironclad example of oppression and Patriarchy!! I wonder if one would feel the same way if basic realism was adhered to throughout the show i.e., if smaller, weaker, less skilled humans (of either sex) were actually treated as they would be in reality. Meaning that for the most part, women who tried to fight bigger, strong, highly skilled men would naturally and inevitably be defeated.<br /><br />That, of course, would be entirely sexist! And we can't have that!  In short, it may very well be that those who espouse such political correctness find reality itself sexist. At that point all hope of reasonable discourse has been lost. And it has been.<br /><br />There are many such groaners throughout the show. Too many to list here (though the Huntress' perpetually loaded crossbow, with which she takes down a dozen or so armed FBI agents via frontal assault, is particularly hilarious). Still, it may be worth a viewing despite the political correctness. There is much to recommend the show if one can learn to ignore the parts not made stupid by feminism.<br /><br />P.S. If you doubt me, look up a video on YT entitled: \\"Female Soldier Boxes Infantry Marine in Iraq\\".
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is very addictive!  It is one of those games you can play for 5 minutes or get sucked in and play all day.
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|Lots of good stuff, here, but you need to stick with the plot line, which can get complicated.  Worth the effort.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Great movie. Not very close to reality, but who watches movies like this for its real life content? Good story line, great bunch of actors- they all fit well together. Automatic weapons are a bit much, but like I said who watches this stuff for reality? Yes, I'm a Willis fan, and yes, I will by Red 2. Buy it and enjoy.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I was warned about THE TREE OF LIFE. Glad I was warned. If had had been expecting some sort of sweeping narrative flow or even not so engaging, I loved this film. Believe it or not, my thoughts seemed to go back at times to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. When I saw that film I simply fell into it, fell into the experience as I watched it and loved it and often return to it. There was no narrative flow to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. I hate to even call that film an experience. It was set some time in the future in space and there were simply images, sights and sounds. I never forgot those. THE TREE OF LIFE seems very similar in some respects. It seems to attract one on different levels of consciousness, existence or remembrance. There is cause and no cause and there is effect and that effect is not always clear or mainstream. Visually THE TREE OF LIFE is pensive, blunt, obscure. I found a lot of character in Sean Penn's face. I saw time, the passage of time.

B0070UFMOW|4.0|I use the E17 hooked to my computer, & docked to an E90K.<br /><br />The only difficulty I have had is that optical connection is just a bit awkward, as there is no optical input on the dock.  When the E17 is docked the optical cable must be plugged into the top of the unit, and I have found that the cable has to be supported, otherwise a problem with pops and scratchy static is experienced.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's been said before.  Bad writing, non-existent plot, dialogue that lays like road kill.  Unlikeable characters and situations that are too far removed from reality, even for fiction.  A piano playing pilot with asthma-inducing good looks who is a Gazillionaire by late twenties?  Please.<br /><br />I laughed more than anything as I skimmed ever fifth or so page.  Ooooo my inner goddess is quirking her eyebrow.  She is now screeching at me like a harpy.  Oh, oh, now she's gleefully giggling.  What a load of wank.  (how's that for a Briticism?)<br /><br />I don't know why I downloaded the kindle edition in the first place; perhaps a morbid curiosity to see if it was really as bad as everyone said?<br /><br />Guess what?  It was.

B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|I was exicted to see that there was a new Bridget Jones novel, since I was a major fan of the other two.  This one, however, just seems silly and immature.  All the humor about lice, vomiting, and farts...yes, it's part of having kids, but it spills over very much into her adult relationships too.<br />Don't waste your money.  The flashes of the old Bridget humor only serve to make you long for what you do not get in this book. Ugh.

0547791097|2.0|If you want many of our cultures most persistent (and false) myths fed back to you this is the book to read.<br /><br />The silent self reliant hero who is perfect at everything he does. He says he only drives, but he kills with as much skill as the likewise mythic Terminator. Never makes a mistake, even as a little kid he is able to one-up bullies with flawless technique. Always in total control, nothing in life, assassins, cars or women ever gets him worked up. He is as cool as overcharged freon air conditioner.<br /><br />The Driver is as unreal as the situations he gets into.<br /><br />If you want characters described as \\"a college age waitress with varicose veins\\" this is the book for you. If revenge fiction gets you revved up, this is the book for you.<br /><br />As a genre cliche, the book is perfect. If you want more than empty literary calories, drive on.

0679722610|5.0|The story starts easily enough. The Continental Op is called to a small town on business unspecified, but with a retainer that holds his interest. Before he gets to Personville, though, his employer is brutally murdered. It doesn't take long for him to look just a  bit under the covers. Personville - Poisonville - has become a battleground where competing gangs, the so-called police included, vie for control. After an attempt or two on his life, he takes it personally. With another fat retainer in hand and a contract to clean out the corruption, he goes about it his own way: turning the rats on each other.<br /><br />One might argue about whether Hammett invented hard-boiled noir - but there's no arguing that he took it to new levels. Unlike modern gore-fests, this one has real personalities driving the action and driven against each other. Layers of bloody schemes unfold until, in the end, only the Op remains. Not as well known as Hammett's others, this one has all their classic character, and maybe a bit more.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Been reading this series since about 1995 and when Robert Jordan died I was very worried I would never see the end of the story. At the time I had also never heard of Brandon Sanderson. So out of the tragedy of James Rigney's death at least a few good things happened - this series finally got completed (and I think very well) and many people were introduced to an amazing writer Brandon Sanderson who has shown himself great at faithfully working on Jordan's books while also amazingly inventive and original in his own.<br />As for the book - well, you need to have read 13 volumes up to now to know what's going on, but if you have made that investment, I don't think you will be disappointed. It moves forward at a good pace, the Last Battle is fought and won (be honest, you couldn't have imagined it would be lost, right?) and there's as god an ending as you can have,bearing in mind the amazing number of plot points which had been left dangling. It wouldn't be humanly possible to close every open story, but at least the main threads are wound up fairly well. As for the rest, I imagine they will live on in fan-fic for decades.

B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|I downloaded the Kindle version of \\"Remote\\" before getting on a Honolulu-to-Houston redeye and finished it en route. When I landed, I ordered a copy to be shipped to my boss.<br /><br />\\"Remote\\" is not like many traditional \\"business books,\\" in that it doesn't tell lots of stories from employers and employees who have made remote working work, nor does it include step-by-step plans for how to become a remote worker or how to convince your boss to let you give it a try. It's important to remember, though, that Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, the authors of \\"Remote,\\" are not business \\"coaches\\" or people who have invented a theory in order to sell books. They are entrepreneurs who, through their company 37Signals, are making remote working work every day. The lessons they share and the arguments they present are ones they've lived and proven themselves. That gave this book a lot more real-world value for me than any \\"how to transform work\\"-type book I've yet read.<br /><br />\\"Remote\\" addresses remote working on intellectual and philosophical as well as practical levels, explaining why the practice benefits employees and companies alike. \\"The office during the day has become the last place people want to be when they really want to get work done,\\" they write. Allowing people to go to the places where they are the most productive, and to work during the times they're most productive, can only improve a company's bottom line and make for happier employees. So long as the work gets done, \\"how our employees distribute those hours across the clock and days just isn't important.\\"<br /><br />As those excerpts might suggest, Fried and Heinemeier Hansson are not making the common, if slightly defensive, argument that businesses won't collapse if bosses let people \\"work from home\\" sometimes. Instead, they advocate -- even evangelize -- remote work as objectively superior, and the inevitable evolutionary successor, to work processes tied to an industrial-revolution model of all employees laboring together under one roof or performance measured by elapsed butts-in-seats time. Not only will younger workers no longer accept that old model (\\"The future, quite literally, belongs to those who get it. Do you think today's teenagers, raised on Facebook and texting, will be sentimental about the old days of all-hands-on-deck, Monday morning meetings? Ha!\\") but neither will those of us oldsters who have tasted the alternative (\\"The new luxury is the luxury of freedom and time. Once you've had a taste of that life, no corner office or fancy chef will be able to drag you back.\\"). For changing thinking -- as well as proving why thinking needs to change, *is* changing, and *should* change -- \\"Remote\\" has an awful lot to recommend it.<br /><br />[edited March 2014 to reword the final paragraph slightly]of all employees laboring together under one roof or performance measured by elapsed butts-in-seats time.

1451696191|4.0|Over the past week, I have finished reading Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. As far as books go, this one is bold and explores topics that many authors would shy away from. The book is written in an interesting way; it's a series of letters to an anonymous person written by a 15 year old boy named Charlie. Charlie is a Wallflower. He watches others from afar but his view of light is extremely insightful and charming due to him being so intelligent. Charlie writes in his letters of his quarrels and worries about high school and life, which he experiences in all it's grit and glory. He's awkward, blunt and emotionally sensitive since he has been coping with the suicide of his friend, Michael, from the previous year. To lessen the fear and anxiety of starting high school alone, Charlie starts writing letters to a stranger, someone he heard was nice but has never met in person. This person is never revealed in the story. During the course of the school year, Charlie has his first date and his first kiss, he deals with bullies, he experiments with drugs and drinking, and he makes friends, loses them, and gains them back. Unfortunately, a disturbing family secret (which I will not share) that Charlie has repressed for his entire life surfaces at the end of the school year. He has a severe mental breakdown and ends up hospitalized. Charlie's final letter closes with feelings of hope: getting released from the hospital, finding new friends during sophomore year, and trying his best not to be a wallflower. He hopes to get out of his head and into the real world, participating in life instead of just watching it fly by. I enjoyed reading this book and it was time well spent. Perks of Being a Wallflower is fascinating and chalk full of such powerful quotes. My favorite being, \\"We can't choose were we come from but we can choose were we go from there\\". This is said by Charlie and it depicts how his life has changed at the end of the book and how he has a new outlook on life. Perks is honest and scarily true to life. If you want a true perspective on the human experience uncensored, read Perks of Being A Wallflower.

B009H75B2E|5.0|In a 1999 essay, &#34;Bach recordings since 1980: a mirror of historical performance,&#34; John Butt wrote, &#34;Many recent releases of the Brandenburg Concertos are indistinguishable from one another in many respects... I could not be confident of distinguishing in a blind test the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment from the Linde-Consort, the Taverner Players, the Brandenburg Consort, or La Petite Bande.&#34; But not even a novice listener would have trouble distinguishing Butt's new recording. Its uniqueness does not result from gimmickry (e.g., hyped-up tempos or chopped-up articulation, or attempts to sound Italian or to reveal some hypothetical &#34;program&#34;); nor does it come just from Butt's historically informed decisions about pitch (the low pitch of A=392) or scoring (one player per part), since both have been used before. It's something more. For one thing, these musicians attain a warmth and richness of the sound that I've never heard before. I thought I knew what the Brandenburgs SOUNDED like on period instruments; this recording made me think again.   But sound is a relatively small part of what's so remarkable about the playing, and the explanation lies partly in the topic Butt was considering in 1999, the ongoing maturation of the historical-performance movement. Decades of research and experience with performance practice (tempo, pitch, tuning, temperament, genres, et al.) are here transmuted into a discourse so fluent and natural that it sounds as if the players are speaking a mother-tongue. This not only helps them steer clear of negatives (e.g., overstressed downbeats, over-articulated motifs, over-driven speeds etc. ); it also helps them find their way into the specialness of each movement.   Consider the bass line in the slow movement of the Sixth. Many period-instrument recordings have cut off the notes, playing them short and &#34;dry&#34; - after all, there are no slurs or articulation marks, so, hey, that means you gotta play 'em non-legato, right? No, actually. John Butt wrote THE book on Bach's articulation marks ([[ASIN:052103180X Bach Interpretation: Articulation Marks in Primary Sources of J. S. Bach (Cambridge Musical Texts and Monographs)]], published in 1991), and he is not cowed by such supposed strictures: he knows that the lack of slurs does not rule out legato. But what he and his players achieve is better than JUST legato. The Dunedin bass line sings, with soul. The result is one of the most moving performances on record.   In fact, the first thing you may notice throughout this recording is the bass line, which is - as in all Dunedin performances - exceptionally shapely, musical, nuanced, and alert. And it is warmly, beautifully captured by Linn's engineers, who make this THE audiophile Brandenburg set. It is closer to &#34;being there&#34; than any recording I've heard. (Note to self: resist the impulse this set is giving me to upgrade my loudspeakers. Resist. Resist!)   Throughout, the tempos dance and flow, but never sound as if the players had just guzzled all the coffee at Zimmerman's. The courtly dances in the First Concerto move buoyantly but naturally, neither sagging nor, unlike some recordings, racing - and their appositeness reflects in part the performers' specific familiarity with Baroque idioms and processes. (Indeed, in the booklet essay, Butt speaks of a &#34;French-style minuet&#34; and &#34;passepied&#34; in different sections of this concerto, and he means something precise by each.)   The players sound not just like native speakers, but as if they are delighting in the conversation. They don't make you think of the constraints of studio note-perfection; instead, they often sound inspired by the proceedings. Soloists I've heard in other recordings (like David Blackadder, Anneke Scott, and Butt himself) outdo themselves. For example, while the low pitch helps the trumpeter in no. 2 in making his line musical (as opposed to blasting), Blackadder has recorded itat this pitch before, but here is both more secure technically AND more in the zone. Best of all is Butt himself in the harpsichord solo in no. 5; it comes closer than any I've heard to sounding improvised but not at all mannered (improvisations wouldn't necessarily sound mannered, just composed on the spot). It's one example of why the set is an exhilarating delight.   The Brandenburgs are masterpieces of form - whaddaya expect of Bach? - and Butt does better than anyone at capturing the way Bach sets up expectations and then does something different that makes your mind open in delight (Butt says a lot of interesting things about form in the liner essay) . But while (as he points out) much of the music would and did work with different scorings, Bach revels in sound in these concertos - the wildly different scoring of each concerto is part of the premise. The Dunedin's gorgeous sound matters.   Since 1999, I've heard some wonderful Brandenburgs, e.g., from Pinnock (on Avie), Suzuki (also at A=392 and superb), and Alessandrini. But as I said, the Dunedin set, for me, takes performance of these works to a new level. I don't mean that each of the six would, in close comparison, beat all the competition for me (although I am confident in predicting that about 1, 5, and 6). But this is my desert-island Brandenburg set. I recommend it warmly to newcomers as well as to jaded connoisseurs who want to rekindle their love affair with these oh-so-familiar works, and, really, to everyone in between.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush!! Very addictive and fun. Better than any of the other games like it. Go candy crush!
B001NLL93W|5.0|The book City of Glass, in t he Mortal Instruments series by  Cassandra Clare is an excellent book.  I found a copy of the Clockwork Prince on sale in a half price book store and got hooked on her books!  The clockwork prince and princess are prequels to the Mortal Instruments series.  Also,  she had developed another character in her books with a series of his own.... You will have to read the books to find out who!<br />As of now, I have read 9 of  her books, they are all fantastic! Read them all!
B0091THRCU|5.0|Snugg makes some very nice affordable leather products. I loved this case, especially the band that you pull to slide out the phone. Very nice, would recommend.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Captivating.  I couldn't stop reading. I want to hang out with Danny. King is amazing at bring characters to life.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Our book club choice for the month and I found it to be a good read with a very unique ending.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Love this game! Just as good if not better than the other two Quell games. Soothing music and fun addictive game play!
B00FF8OKJE|3.0|This game was great, until someone decided to be a jerk and spammed his attacks on my castle, killed all my troops and stole all my stuff, Goodgame, make protection last longer after an attack, it's getting ridiculous.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|great app. I use it on both my phone and my kindle fire. cleans everything up nicely and fast too!
0385350864|5.0|I think the book is delightful and perfectly unpretentious. Like the first two, I laugh constantly and find Bridget as charming as ever. I enjoy the plot more even than book 2, when Bridget is all of a sudden bizarrely arrested in Thailand.<br />I think people are mad about the &#34;sad situation&#34; (no spoilers) but come on! The reason why these books are so great is because the laughter is balanced by Bridget's loneliness, which is a theme for her character. If she was just living happily ever after there would be no conflict and no plot.<br />I think the haters are just afraid of change.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I do not know what else to say about this book but it is a great story. I loved this book, it was well written, great character development and emotional heart tugger.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|this is the essential version of Avatar that you need to watch. the added scenes (or, rather, re-added) fill the story much more nicely and add so much more backstory to the characters. The film just seems &#34;complete&#34; now, despite how you may have felt previously, with the theatrical version.<br /><br />picture:<br />amazing. i would go so far as to say it's flawless. color is absolutely gorgeous. lines are super strong and crisp. no edge halos, banding, motion blur in sight. black levels are black. the lushy greens of the jungles are so pretty to look at. the blue skin is beautifully blue. everything looks smooth and i can't say this enough: the picture is absolutely gorgeous.<br /><br />audio:<br />please. ok, ok. if you must hear something about it: the lossless HD audio is outstanding. I use this film (and, now, this version of this film) as a demo to show off my sound system to friends and family. the wall of sound that encompasses you throughout each speaker travels around the room and forces you to experience the film's foreign world from the inside out. you'll hear everything from unseen creatures chirping in the background of your rear, surround speakers, to gunfire blasting from your subwoofer throughout the front AND surround speakers. LFE output is strong and heavy, to say the absolute least. wind and rustling of leaves are so subtly crisp that you may likely forget you're listening for these things and just get immersed into the film's world itself. that happened frequently with me. regardless, everything about the audio quality for this Extended Avatar Collector's Edition release is amazing.<br /><br />overall:<br />highly, highly, highly recommended. if you feel you didn't like the theatrical version for whatever reason, perhaps because of its story, check this out. its extended scenes may make you change your mind about the film and its characters. also, the special features are abundant and certainly entertaining to rummage through. GET IT.
B00DYWKPAQ|4.0|The whole album has my attention, but there are some tracks I can't seem to move beyond without listening to them over and over.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|enter the dragon. in a much, much, much better quality blu-ray transfer than the previous version. i knew if i waited long enough, they'd re-release this film with a better audio track and improved picture.<br /><br />picture:<br />much better than ever before. black levels are fantastic. contrast is great. there's some nice, natural film grain goin on throughout. skin tones are fresh and vivid. lines are strong and crisp. everything looks phenomenal on this HD re-release.<br /><br />audio:<br />powerful. have you heard Bruce Lee's war cries in lossless HD audio? no? well, then, get this and hear them yourself. surround activity is strong. dynamic range is wide. LFE output is heavy (listen to the wind rush for a split second right before the booming impact of every punch and kick). dialogue is clear and audible. PLEASE check out this film/blu-ray. it's great.<br /><br />overall:<br />only complaint: THERE'S NO SIGN OF &#34;A WARRIOR'S JOURNEY&#34; ANYWHERE ON HERE. they have pretty much every other documentary/lost footage/whatever except the one that we actually want to watch. oh well. if you can look past that, get this version of &#34;Enter the Dragon&#34; to replace whatever you have currently (unless you have the version that does contain &#34;A Warrior's Journey&#34;, then keep that, don't replace it).<br /><br />GET IT.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|Never saw the original Star Wars; now working my way through the six of them, making this the fourth in the series, although I understand it is the first as to be made and issued. First impression, of course, is how young Harrison Ford looks(the other stars I have not seen since they made this film), Of course, Alec Guinness is gone now as are others I didn't identify ( I imagine). Unlike more avid film-goers, I know only the versions that are presented in the six that I purchased, so have nothing to add to that favored discussion of some reviewers. What did I think about the film that is shown here. It was good fun. Little time was spent on anything that didn't directly contribute to the action, which was usually good to watch. There is no thought involved, no issues of any consequence (I can't get worked up about the Fate of the Empire or Plant Xenia.) The acting was appropriate to the demands of the film, which were light indeed. Alec Guinness, of course, needed only a small fraction of his talent, to look good and to fulfill his contract. Ford and Hamill were appealing in their parts, which required minimal acting skills, Fisher was barely adequate in a part that was barely part of the film. No fault of hers, so far as I can see, that was the way it was written.<br />All-in-all, for those who have not seen the movie previously, this is very light but entertaining fare. My star rating, of course, only evaluates this against other similar films.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|great film.<br /><br />picture:<br />it's a Disney/Pixar film made a few years ago. of course it looks good. technically speaking, from the blu-ray transfer, it's clear. color fits the tone of the film, no sign of edge halos or motion blur, all the food in the film just teases you and makes you incredibly hungry... everything looks fantastic. great HD transfer.<br /><br />audio:<br />lots of surround activity. great lossless audio. sound has a very wide dynamic range and is incredibly crisp. i never thought pangs from pots and pans would sound so good. very immersive wall of sound. good job Disney.<br /><br />overall:<br />Get it.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|The quality of this HD rental was not up to par for the extra cost.  The movie itself was tacky and maybe good for those who love transformers but I can see why this movie was no blockbuster.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|what. a. classic.<br /><br />picture:<br />very good HD remastering. lines are crisp. black is black. colors are so vivid and beautiful. it looks phenomenal. good job Disney.<br /><br />audio:<br />also very good. no complaints<br /><br />overall:<br />GET IT. it's also kind of rare now. good luck finding this in stores.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a very fun game. Warning this game can be addictive do not down load during midterms. Be prepared to spend hours on this game.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|quality blu-ray remastering. colors looks great, lossless audio is clear and encompassing. brought back good memories.<br /><br />Get it. It's worth it.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|Great love story.  Loved the characters.  The scenery was beautiful.  It made you believe in true love and the power of devotion.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|fantastic film. fantastic HD release from Criterion.<br /><br />picture:<br />very good. almost forgot it was shot on digital camera and not film. looks nigh flawless, though. black levels are great and colors are brownish and old-timey; very fitting to the tone of the movie itself. lines are very clear and crisp and detail is magnificent. consistent picture throughout, no signs of edge halos (wouldn't typically get them from movies made this recently).<br /><br />audio:<br />great. It's lossless audio from Criterion. it's Criterion, period. trust them.<br /><br />overall:<br />Get it. Great film to just own, and there's a long, very good making-of included along with a few other special features.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Though I felt it was a little inane in the beginning, it held my interest. It ended very sweetly and I love those types of endings.
B00F3BRQLM|5.0|picture:<br />very, very good.<br /><br />audio:<br />also, very, very good.<br /><br />overall:<br />not a very descriptive blu-ray review but... this film came out earlier this year. the quality of most blu-rays (especially for films of this magnitude) are expected to be standardized in the great to phenomenal range.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game because it is like subway surfers but just a little better I love this game play it please and like my comment.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I'll admit, I had my doubts. What series could ever follow the most beloved Percy Jackson and the Olympians? Well, The heroes of Olympus! These books stay true to the amazing world of monsters and gods that Riordan detailed in the previous series. I can't get enough! Buy this book or you are not a true Percy Jackson fan. You won't regret it, I swear on the River Styx!
1401230067|4.0|This was a classic. It was a nice long read with the thickness of the book and all. The paper was on the old kind, which isn't bad. I enjoyed it very much and will get the next volume. I haven't read any other Hellblazer, so I can't compare, yet. But overall it was a great read. Oh and  spoiler alert.......Swampy :)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I've enjoy so much.I would like to see if you can updated with new stages like the beach and the vehicle like the hovercraft.I really appreciate if you can updated with new stages and the hovercraft .

B007IXWL2C|4.0|To make a long story short Christian finally learns to Trust Ana and they have a few very close calls and personal ups and downs- mostly while having all kinds of &#34;kinky f$&kery&#34;. And just vanilla too.  And then they start a family.  I read all three books one right after another.  This is not great writing, not for the innocent and I mean more than just virgins when I say that, but it is really a hot &#34;fairy tale&#34;.  Girl meets handsome, rich, and her personal brand of mind-blowing sexpertise,  and he falls in love with her - they get married and eventually live happily ever after.  Will definitely make you want More.  Ha ha ha
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Anyone who liked Matthew Quick's Silver Linings Playbook will love this novel. At its center is a similarly \\"oddball\\" character. Here it's Don Tillman, a genetics professor at an Australian university who has Asperger's Syndrome. He sets out on the impossible task of finding a wife, using a set of criteria and screening questionnaire that no woman who could pass. In the meantime, he meets a graduate student at the same university where he teaches who is trying to determine who her biological father is. He offers to use his technical expertise to help her. Initially, they seem a hopelessly ill-suited match. He is hilariously inept at social interaction, and she fails to meet some of the most critical criteria in his Wife Project - she's a smoker, dies her hair and is a vegetarian (although she does eat fish, if it falls in the sustainably caught category!) The book delivers page after page of laughs as you watch their love affair unfold and meet the inevitable complications. Don Tillman is one of the most unique protagonists you'll come across, and Simsion does a rather awe-inspiring job of maintaining Don's distinctive voice over the full-length of the novel. And Rosie is such an endearing character because she can look past Don's constant social faux pas and see the quality of the man beneath. And it doesn't hurt that he looks like Gregory Peck. The book will also remind you of the Curious Incident of the Dog in Night Time. What Mark Haddon did for insight into the mind of an autistic boy, Simsion does here for Asperger's Syndrome. Highly, highly recommended, if you enjoy screwball romantic comedies!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I LOVED this book! The characters stayed with me after I finished reading it. The descriptions were so vivid, I felt like I was right there, a part of the story. Great historical fiction book of slavery times. I couldn't put the book down and highly recommend it. One of my new all time favorite books!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I wish Veronica Roth wouldn't have done what she did to tris.... Really disappointed. But other than that really good way to end the series
0345495004|3.0|I love historical fiction, and I felt like this novel helped me understand FLW. However, the ending left me very disturbed. I know that really did happen, but I wish the author had ended it before that terrible event. I had trouble sleeping just thinking about it. Also, the Ellen Key thing, while historically interesting, felt like a distraction to the story.<br /><br />I also don't think that Mamah was honest with herself. We almost get the feeling that she regretted her decision, but then, why go back to FLW? It's not the author's fault, of course...
B00296A4F4|5.0|My watched this show when it first came on, but had to stop when I moved overseas for the military. Now I am able to watch it on amazon, and it is as good as I remember :)
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|It's not a bad game. Easy for kids, like the computer game, fun graphics. I would highly recommend it for young kids.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|Beautifully written - wonderful evocation of landscape and understanding of human relationships. I read all three books in the trilogy and could not put them down until i'd finished.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love it! Free, works without hassle, and has whatever you might be after. Highly recommended for anyone looking to increase their smartphone or computer capabilities.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  I gave it 5 stars because it keeps your brain busy!!!  One of the best games out.
B0007TKNII|5.0|An amazing movie to say the least! By the end, I was moved to tears, and because I don't want to give anything away I will only say this: It is a masterpiece where you can have a villain that you can easily sympathize with.<br />That being said, everything was perfect! The cinematography, the songs, the characters and the cast chosen to represent them!<br />Bravo!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun but I,always run out of the extras. It is hard to get all of the puzzle pieces to complete a collection. But I do really enjoy playing it.

B001UW58WW|5.0|Nice arrangements , well done. I would recommend it to all classic music lovers who really like listening to violin.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The first review I read spoiled the ending in the first sentence. I am a huge fan of the series but based on reviews, I dreaded reading the book. It is a different writing style than we have seen in the past and at times I had a difficult time remembering if I was reading from Tobias or Tris' point of view. While it wasn't the ending I dreamed of, I am quite pleased with the book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app helps me with homework like 1,062,100+2,173,211. And just in everyday math. It also comes in handy for things like time.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am very disappointed in book three of this trilogy.  There are numerous issues from plot devices to the science to character issues to conclusion.  In all honesty had I known how disappointed in the trilogy that I was going to become the further in that I read it, I wouldn't have started it to begin with; I certainly wouldn't have wasted my hard earned  money on it.  Such is my irritation and disappointment, I seriously doubt I will even contemplate reading anything else by the author.  I'm not even keeping my books but giving them away with a handwritten warning on the inside of the book cover.  Wasted hours that I will never be able to get back.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|Im a Glasper Fan!!! What I love most about this album is the collabs and of course bro Glasper's style of playing. From Snoop to Erro to even Brandy, he manages to play his style. I would have liked to hear more him playing but still hands down this CD is still on point. I still would like to hear a Glasper and Hargrove &#34;Experiment&#34;. I had to download the entire CD this time!!!!!

B001HN6922|5.0|My daughter and I love watching it together. We share lots of laughs together. For a two year old this is her favorite movie.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book. Now that I have read the book, I understand why the movie was so good.<br />They had the perfect starting point. Good writing is good writing no matter what the genre, no matter what the writing or who the writing is for. This is good writting, good story telling and I am in for the ride and the rest of the books.<br />Good stuff Rick.
B00E8JTSVG|4.0|A  wonderful story  blending old traditions and present day life into what should become new ones. I hope the lodges make these stories available to present day travelers. It will enhance the wonderful beauty and mystery of the area. Or at least add another dimension  to their experience. Hopefully they will want to learn more about the original inhabitants of the area. Thanks for reminding me of many wonderful times spent there when I was very young. Jbshorses

B003K1EYM6|4.0|I bought this so I could connect my Ipad 1 to a Yamaha portable grand keyboard so that I could use Synthesia to play midi files in a Rock Band style educational app.  It worked like a charm, just plug and play.  So I was very, very happy with that.  The app immediately recognized that the digital piano was attached.  No driver headaches or anything (even in Windows, I have to make sure to download the right drivers)  So that was worth 5 stars!<br /><br />But disappointed that I could not get the SD card attachment to work.  Maybe iPad 1 just doesn't support it, but I couldn't figure it out.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|The fluid controls and really fast response times are wonderful! I have yet to experience any delayed responses with this controller.<br /><br />Battery life is pretty good. I've had the same batteries in it for about a month and a half, of on and off gameplay, and it still has a charge.<br /><br />However, the only real downside to buying this product, is the limited compatibility (unless your iOS device is jailbroken...but I would recommend against doing that). There are only a handful of games that work with this controller.
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|It is an all around snappy processor. The price is similar to an Intel i3, but crushes any i3's graphics. The built in HD graphics love my 2400mhz ram. With the 2400 ram it really lets the built-in gpu shine.
0141393394|5.0|Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein is one of murder, misunderstandings, and a simple desire to be loved. Through the story of a horrific monster and it's relationship with it's creator, Shelley teaches us to never take love for granted, and to consider the consequences of our actions before taking them. When young Victor Frankenstein decided to use his knowledge of science to create a sentient being, he did not think ahead, and as a result he payed for it dearly for the rest of his life. The monster he created only wished to be accepted and loved, but as a result of Victor's poor judgement in abandoning him, the monster blamed Victor and would stop at nothing to see him suffer.<br />The monster often seems to take the persona of a child, one who is rejected and abandoned by his parents. When he is brought into the world, he is forced to learn how it works all by himself. Light, people, language, fire, even his own body are entirely new concepts. Once he learns about his creator, or father, he feels resentment towards him.  He feels Victor was obligated to raise and love him, but instead abandoned him for his own selfish reasons. All the monster wants in life is to feel loved and accepted; his revenge is just his way of making Victor experience what he feels so deeply: profound loneliness.<br />The effects of rejection and lack of acceptance are demonstrated extraordinarily well in this book. In many ways, the point being made is very similar to the point of David Lynch's film \\"Elephant Man.\\" Both the monster and the Elephant man are feared and shunned for their physical appearance, something which is far beyond their control. The effects of this conflict manifests itself in different ways (one with violence, and another with despair).  The connection between the book and the film is still quite evident. In the end, the reader/viewer empathizes with both characters, and understand the atrocities they were subjected to. The \\"monsters\\" of both stories were wrongly judged and unfairly treated.  We come away from both tales with a sense of sympathy and compassion.  This subject of acceptance is a very common theme in literature, but few handle it as well as Shelley did in \\"Frankenstein.\\"d and unfairly treated.  We come away from both tales with a sense of sympathy and compassion.  This subject of acceptance is a very common theme in literature, but few handle it as well as Shelley did in \\"Frankenstein.\\"
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|So far i like the game. Like that they show you the solution if you chose. So far I Like
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I never was very interested in working the puzzle games like Myst and tried this on whim.  So glad I did!  The workmenship of the details in the graphics is crazy great.<br />You can imagine yourself working with Sherlock Holmes in that time period.<br />Just wonderful.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|On the one hand I loved the book and found it quite moving at times.  Hosseini is clearly a gifted writer whose verbal descriptions can be extraordinary.  \\"I think of him now, ragged and lost, staggering across a desert, the path behind him littered with all the shiny little pieces that life has ripped from him.\\"  Is that good or what?  That's the upside.<br /><br />The negative in this book only is that the story line is fractured and at times difficult to follow.  I didn't always know who was narrating, where they were, when things were happening and most of all, the chapters of the book didn't seem interwoven enough to form a cohesive tale.  The first chapter, which mostly contains an allegorical tale could have been easily omitted without any loss to the book.  Cliffs notes on this book could be the shortest ever.<br /><br />If you read this, I recommend that you do not drink alcohol while doing so.  The context shifts abruptly throughout the book and you might find yourself rereading a lot.  Whazzat?  Whozzat?  Wherezat?  Whenzatt?  I created a character map as an assist and found it quite helpful.  A three dimensional character, time and location map would be better.  But who does that?
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I know it's crazy to say but this series is something my wife and I thoroughly enjoy watching together.  Very excited to see season 3 when it comes out.<br /><br />We don't have much in common with respect to TV tastes but this is one that we both thoroughly enjoy.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It's a style of writing that will talk getting used to but it's an incredibly touching book. Get the narration to help you with some of the German words unless you speak it.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Our family really enjoyed this movie.  Not only is the Zombie angle well explained to suck you in to the plot, and the action keeps you there, there are very chilling implications about how fast a disease could spread that are very well illustrated in this movie.<br /><br />I thought this 'mindless zombie horror movie' also provided some educational value.

0547258305|4.0|Graceling was a stupendous book and I enjoyed reading it very much. After all, who doesn’t love fantasy stories? The character development was great. In the beginning, Katsa, our heroine, was a girl at the height of adolescence who was afraid of herself because of her Grace, a special talent that could sometimes be more akin to a curse, and her Grace was “killing.” Everything turned around, though, when Katsa met Po. She was inspired by Po, which allowed her to mature and evolve. I feel that Katsa can inspire people the same way she was inspired. Without a doubt, I was inspired by her.<br /><br />Like any other book, this book has its downs as well as its ups. Personally, I didn’t like the ending. I felt that there wasn’t much of a climax and there could have been more to the conclusion. Nevertheless, Graceling was a compelling read. It was extremely difficult for me to put the novel down and even harder to stop thinking about it. Furthermore, the plot was intriguing and I have to admit that the romance in the story was, too. The politics of the story was simply fascinating. You don’t see the political aspect of things often in fantasy novels like this. Overall, Graceling was a wonderfully magnificent book and I would recommend it to just about every young adult. If you’re looking for other books to read after finishing this one, then you should read Fire, the next book in the series. Although the protagonist is no longer Katsa, there is still a strong female lead that’s similar to her, so I’m sure the book will be enjoyable.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game but motion a little jerky compared to phone version.  Glad it has finally arrived, I have been waiting

B00D37UP4S|5.0|I loved the book. Ignore the fact that the author also wrote The Series That Should Not Be Named. This was a great well thought out sci fi book and they did a good job turning it into a movie. I really enjoyed the book and the movie. The actors did a great job and bringing out the same feeling the book evokes.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I truly enjoyed every minute that I was reading the Divergent series.  I am a seventh grade Language Arts teacher, and I use Divergent  as part of my unit on Dystopias.  I, of course, read Allegiant the minute it came out and I devoured it, relishing every word.  I think Veronica Roth is a truly brave, remarkable, great writer for writing the ending that she did.  She did such a wonderful job explaining Tris's decision, in her own words, to risk her life to save her brother's.  I saw it as the the true culmination of her struggles in finding her identity.  I also appreciated Roth's comments about the ending on her blog, and even though I already understood Tris's death before I read that post, I hope Roth's comments help other readers understand Tris's death as well.  I can also use your words and not just my own feelings and interpretations to help explain it to my students whose twelve year old minds may not understand the depth of Tris's character.  I also loved that Tobias was a narrator in this book.  Tobias has been my favorite character all along, and it was nice to finally hear his voice in this novel alongside Tris's.  Of course, I understand the necessity of his voice after Tris's death so the story could continue.  I have to say, although I did not cry the moment Tris died, I did cry reading Tobias's grief.  I'm glad that he ended up coming to a place of peace by the end of the novel.  Overall, I commend Roth for being brave enough to have her protagonist die in the end, because it was a fitting end to Tris's ultimate goal to become truly self-sacrificing like her parents and to live/die for the people she loves.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|This movie does not take itself seriously in anyway but it is seriously entertaining! If you like chick flicks this is the way to go. It has everything plot wise. Girl trouble, Musical interludes, Making friends, Personal Growth, Boy trouble, A road trip, A competition, and funny commentary. The music is awesome! I still can't figure out who really created Becca's Mixes but I am dying to get my hands on them.
0763644765|5.0|My 22 month old daughter has been showing an interest in using the potty so we figured it was a good time to dive into some bibliotherapy as it has been helpful in the past for a variety of reasons (eg introducing her to her new baby sister). Very pleased with this book and the first night after we received it she asked us to read it to her again, and again, and again! Out of all the books on &#34;potty time&#34; we have bought for her she seems to enjoy this one the most due to it's simple colorful pictures and direct message without too many words. I also like how it shows the child waiting on the potty for the tinkle to come as this is a step other books seem to miss out on!
3836538725|5.0|Extraordinary pictures from all over the world! Sebastiao Salgado give us an idea where we come from.<br />A book to have in  any bookshelf.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I can't believe that this book ended the way it did. Disappointed is a major understatement. The whole book is slow to start too :(
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series, interestingly written and skillfully filmed, illustrates the changing circumstance of the Rich and the Poor through our recent Western history.  It is informative as well as entertaining.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|I always love Gary's writing.  Some of the new things he says about J blew me away.  But his books always remind you that the real answer is always about forgiveness.  I love this book more than the last one, but am now looking forward to his next one.  I hope he keeps on writing and writing.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I love any story about time travel so this book is interesting to me, plus King does a good job of not making it too unbelievable. Good story with only a few slow spots. Not my favorite Stephen King book but definitely worth your time.
B0034CNSFU|5.0|I actually bought this for my Grandson who is not learning the guitar and he is a lefty like Jimi.  I hope that this will inspire him to excel.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|I am truly addicted to Sex and the City. I actually discovered it late (as in 2 months ago) and it didn't take me long to blow through all the seasons. After I finished that, I knew I had to watch the movie, but couldn't find it anywhere. Enter my Amazon addiction. I shopped around until I found what I liked and wanted, ordered it. This says &#34;single-disc&#34; but what I received was the double disc with extra features with wide and full screen. I was beyond happy. I can't say everyone will be as lucky, but I am VERY happy with my purchase.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's addicting, in a good way!  I start off tense, wound up from life, and after what seems like a few minutes, a half hour has passed and I'm relaxed.  Google stuff Maynard.  Damn spell check, \\"good stuff Maynard!\\"
B00C50NV2M|4.0|I switched back and forth 20 times…trying to find even a tiny difference between the<br />ugly orange 3d glasses that came with my LG TV, and this pair.<br />I could find absolutely zero difference: neither pair was sharper<br />or made the move darker than the other.<br />So, for 3D functionality, in my experience they are precisely equal.<br />I think some people would definitely rate these as more stylish than the<br />hideous orange ones, so that may give these a small edge.<br /><br />As for me, the slightly odd frame design of these distracted me just a tiny bit…<br />so--all other things being equal--I'll probably wind up using the orange ones<br />more often...
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This game is very interesting and strategic game if your not too well at strategy I strongly suggest doing the tutorials I play this game on ps3 and love it.<br /><br />The only downside to this game is multiplayer.But if you like single-player strategies then this is your game
B008XG1X18|4.0|The pinterest app is faster and easier to use than the website. I only wish you could also edit board covers.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Enjoyed this show from the start and it gets better each show , just the right amount of witty humor for this drama
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|And nothing that I expected. Twists and turns that confuse and surprise in ways that held and delighted me. I am happy to finally be done with this compulsion, for I am exhausted.<br />Thank you for a wonderful time!
B00G32OER4|5.0|LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! If you watch Asian horror movies and agree that Asian horror films are scarier in general compared to American horror films...THIS ONE CAN MATCH THE TERROR OF ASIAN HORROR FILMS! Perfect for Halloween, which happens to be TODAY! Wow, that's freaking scary. Okay, have a great night horror fans!
B003MC5N28|4.0|This was billed as a quartet and I'd heard it was a trilogy. Very good read with subtle symbolism. But what happened to the other parts of the story? It should have been in this bundle in my opinion.
B009R659L8|4.0|The book is not bad, but when you start reading it, make yourself your own cast of characters. As complicated as it gets, the ending is a let down, perhaps because you figured it out
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|I picked this up for my son's summer reading program. He enjoyed it and I'm happy I got him to read some classic literature instead of some of the junk that's lining bookstore shelves for teenagers these days.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|candy crush is the best game i have ever played! This old lady finds Candy Crush to be challenging and a great way to break up a hectic day.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  Every chapter was more exciting than the last.  Can't wait to read volumes 2 and 3.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game but since yesterday have been unable to play.  Nothing happens when I click on the level number in order to start the game.  Hope this gets fixed soon as I am having withdrawal.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My sister got me hooked on this game.  It is both challenging and fun.  Everyone should give t a try...nice way to pass time and have fun.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham continues to capture my interest with his amazing courtroom scenes. The judge, the lawyers, and the jury are phenomenal. Jake and the Judge are back! Hope Grisham continues the sequels.
B000SJ9N1K|5.0|Zep at their best - HOTH  has the greatest range of style on any of their albums and all done with conviction.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Terrible. There is no finalizing of any characters. It felt too rushed  in a less than 400 page book it did not feel one bit complete.  It doesnt even feel part of the series thats how off it is. Very dissapointed on how my favorite series ended.
B00FOU1O3S|1.0|every single time I get off of the game it makes me have to install it again so decide just not to get it anymore
B002CIY8EM|4.0|I thought the book gave interesting theories. It gives you something to think about. I would recommend this book to read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is really really good.  It's deserves all the wonderful reviews.  It kept me on the edge of my feet and thinking throughout the entire thing.  I can't wait to read her other books.  Bravo!
1909313033|5.0|Magnificent! To die for! A masterful work of art! Will turn into the next Twilight Saga some day! Period! Buy it!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Great way to challenge one's skills at playing backgammon. Can be addictive but great way to fill time when traveling.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is great until you run out of lives--and either have to buy one for $1.00 or wait until your time expire--which is what I tend to do, cannot see buying lives especially only one life for 99 cent -- wish it could be atleast 5 more lives, which is what you get when it's full and ready for the each level.  With all that -- I still enjoy the challenge of the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is my absolute favorite nemesis. It was love at first bite! Just when you think you have the strategy down, here comes chance to blow it all away. Love it!
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Buddy Guy stands the time test and his new album is LOUD. As it should be, the blues master cranks it, and not a disappointing track.
006202406X|1.0|Spoiler:<br /><br />At first, the two narrators have the same voice, and that's bad.The second Thing is,in this book Tobias isn't the strong man anymore, he is very whiny.<br />At last, this should be a YA book and the most YA need a little bit hope,and not every Teenager can handle with this end!!!For me, I think in every book it's useless to kill the MAIN CHARACTER, because in a end like this I have the feeling, that I have read the first two books for nothing.For this book,I accompany Tris three books long and Miss Roth let her die, I think that's a very bad step. Sorry Miss Roth, but after this end, I never want to watch the movie, and I think the end in these book could be the end for your career. Sorry for my bad English, I come from Germany.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My original Roku is showing its age and I don't want to spend $100 for the ethernet model. I selected this as my iPad can mirror it -- and I'm not disappointed. For $35, well worth the effort.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I believe this book has started me on a new way of eating!!  If you are looking for an uncomplicated way to improve your health, this just might be it.
1439190275|4.0|great for those needing help to combat metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance.  Has helped me a lot and I have lost weight!
B002UM5BXW|3.0|This was an interesting look behind the food industry. Good to in now<br /><br /> Few little \\"secrets\\" of th he industry.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|Love Has Forgotten No One is Gary Renard's third book in the series.<br />This book continues in the same vein as the first two, with Gary's smart ass humour to the fore<br />and his amazing adventures with the two ascended masters, Pursah and Arten.<br />You don't need to have read the first two books to enjoy and get benefit from this one, but<br />it helps to understand what's going on.<br />This book builds on the first two and really takes it up a gear regarding foregiveness.<br />I thoroughly recommend this book to fellow students of A Course In Miracles, for which these books provide a commentary.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My friends told me to stay away because of how addicting it was. I believed them until it was downloaded onto my kindle. Now I can't stop!! It's on my phone and kindle.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|very bad, it does not worked, and it totally waste my money. since it is only 22 bucks, i'm not going to return it. I would not recommened for this one, if you want a good car charger, you had better find anything else.
B00459EZLW|5.0|Watching  this for the third time, but I'm enjoying it as if were the first time.  I don't understand why there have been no follow ups to the sereies, seems perfect for a what happens when they cross the great divide.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Epic! This reboot of the classic just gets better and better. Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan is both chilling and heart wrenching. Zachary Quinto treads the fine line between Spock's logical Vulcan side and his more emotional human side nicely. Well done!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I am very impressed with the ebay app for my android - I was able to win my item in the last seconds of the auction, as well as search and keep updated on my items right from my phone. GREAT APP!! I never would have won the auctions had I not had this app, since I'm too busy to sit in front of my computer to bid in the last minutes/seconds of an auction.
B0034JKZ86|2.0|I never watched these movies but when my nieces say boring they mean it.  I wouldn't recommend the movie to anyone
B006O2QNOU|5.0|I love this movie. I don't watch a lot of dramas but watched this on the recommendation of a friend. It feels quite realistic to me, in most respects. It is an accurate portrayal of how most corporate functions communicate between themselves, how the people involved attempt to both have and avoid responsibility at the same time, and how precarious the whole thing can be in times of crisis.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|I guess I was expecting something totally different.  A movie about magic I was expecting some more realistic magic scenes.  Most of everything they do is so unbelievable that it pretty much seems make believe.  But in the movies defense it is a movie.
B0018O4YT0|1.0|I liked everything about this movie except for the plot, the script and the acting.  The first few minutes is pretty good, then it starts to get rather tiring, and the ending is just plain silly.  It's like they showed a bunch of high school kids a cool opening scene from a film-noir and asked \\"what should happen next?\\" and by the time the kids got to the end they were drunk or something.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! I am glad you run out of lives or I'd probably never stop playing! I wish you had more than 5 lives though. Like maybe 10 but no more than that
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book is action packed with wild adventures with crazy infected people, deadly creatures, and betrayal. I would rate this give stars.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! It was full of twists and turns that I could not have predicted. This was such a great read!
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|Great new album.  Very familiar sound yet the progressive sound remains. Just love it. Very happy with the purchase great group.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am an old school Star Trek Fan, this movies was GREAT!<br />I would like to see the next one and the one after that.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I needed an application that can download videos so that I can go on the road without using up my WIFI mins.
0226264211|5.0|As a free marketeer I've heard all this before, but never so well said.  After reading his thoughts I can't understand how anyone can not agree with him.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I'm  so disappointed  that this app is no longer working on my kindle due to a error that force  closes it. contacted tech support; I hope they can fix it; I really. love this game.
0062238868|4.0|This is a good story of Chris Kyle's life.  It covers his years growing up in TX, his military training, and the action in various locations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I think you also get a good insight into the mind of a sniper.  This is not a literary work of art, it's an autobiography by everyman.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|American Horror Story is soooooooo scary. A &#34;definite buy&#34; for those who like to be scared out of their wits. Couldn't believe it was actually on a Prime TV station (due to complete nudity scenes), but I had / have a hard time watching this scary show home alone.<br />If you love to be scared over and over again, then, by all means, buy the dvd !!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Love the game but feel cheated when friends send extra lives and i dont get any of them. I understand you only get extra games if played on an iphone which I dont have.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This audio book was wonderfully written.  It showed the culture of the day and was so much better than the movie!
B0000256VK|5.0|This ia a favorite oldie but goodie. Used to have it on tape until cars and home sound systems no longer had tape players. Bryan Ferry at his very best. It has a musical motion and movement to it that is perfect for a road trip. Transports me back in time. The kind of recording that you will recall exactly when and where you first heard it. Has that quality and uniqueness that music afficiandos refer to as \\"a musical sense of smell\\".
B0029LCJJS|4.0|The costumes and furnishings were wonderful. My husband and I would look up history to see if it was historically accurate and was impressed with that as well.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I find to be not good.I can't even open it on my kindle fire HD.I wasted my money and time to download a product that I can't use.
B0030ZOYJ0|4.0|the movie is all fine and dandy, and it even came with a little picture book or whatever, but the case came with a dented corner :(
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Sometimes new artists have a great debut album but then the second one seems to miss something.  That is not the case with Unorthodox Jukebox, catchy songs, beautiful songs, it has the same great mix as the first album, can't wait for Bruno Mars third album.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Its a good game, but overrated. My brother and his girlfriend love this game! I don't get what the fuss is about, and they charge money to level up! Gimme a break!
B00DI75SWM|4.0|This is fun and so easy to use.  My 7 year old works this app like a champ.  I REALLY LIKE IT
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great follow up to the The Shining ( the book not the movie).  I thought it was well thought out and segwayed easily from the first book. You could read this on its own but you would be doing yourself a disservice by not reading The Shining first.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is challenging. I however wish their were a few more free lives to play with. All in all I enjoy it very much and look forward to playing it when the time has elapsed and I have new lives to play with.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|This was a great documentary.  Not too long, but had enough information to make it interesting.  Several sub-stories that can be shared with students in segments.  Well done!
B007MU85D0|4.0|I download this album after listening to the samples. I think it's a moving evocative piece of work, reminding me very much of the Dream Academy in the 80's.
B0015D3YQI|4.0|This great 80s flick with Jennifer Connelly is a nice piece of work by Argento, with good locations, awesome soundtrack, and a bizarre and fascinating story featuring a girl who communicates with insects, which lead her to dead bodies and the discovery of a serial killer.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|I was sorry to hear that Creed broke up, formed a new band and replaced Scott Stapp as their lead singer, but after listening to this record, I think Alterbridge has a much better sound than Creed ever did. This album is powerful. energetic and moving at the same time. I'm not a huge fan of heavy metal, so some of the power chords were a little too over the top for my taste, but I think as a rock record overall Fortress succeeds very much, and Myles Kennedy(with his four octave range) is clearly a much better vocalist than Scott Stapp ever was. Stapp has a good voice, but it definitely has it's limits, whereas Kennedy wails lyrics like he could go on forever(a la Chris Cornell).<br /><br />I also found it curious that Stapp released his new single on the same day that Fortress came out. A coincidence?<br /><br />I don't think so..
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Enjoyed the action and working together of super-heroes!<br />The gizmo side of the plot is interesting as they point to what can be... or not!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Thank you John your latest book just kept me up late at night for the past three nights.  I think I have read every one of your books and I can't wait for the next one.  You did a lot of research and brought up some of America's darkest history.  You are the lawyer, you know the law and procedure.  I suppose it could have worked that way.  That's why I am such a huge fan!  What's next?
B0054PSY2W|5.0|My dad and I love this movie.  We even call each other when we run across it playing on the TV.  I bought this for him for Christmas, and we got a great laugh about it.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|Started watching it after I completed the 10 seasons of SG1 and this was the perfect dessert.  Was hooked after the first show.  So it a few years ago, so I decided to watch it again...
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|well I watched the movie and played the first one and was dissatisfied as their was no astronomy or Zeus. but I'm gonna get this and see what its like so no rating its just random
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|This met and exceeded my expectations.  I hadn't heard Alan do any Bluegrass previously but he really outdid himself on this album.  Tremendously talented man.!!!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|**There may be some potential spoilers**<br /><br />The number of 1 and 2 star reviews this book has received is very disappointing to me. A lot of the big problem people have is that they didn't &#34;like&#34; the ending, which is distinctly different from the ending not being &#34;good&#34;. When you spend a few years developing a character and their history, their background, and the way they process information, you do them a complete disservice by having them act the way the reader would want, rather than the way the character would act. If a different decision had been made, it would have rendered so many statements and choices in the series unimportant or useless. The character did what she would have done, and I commend Roth for keeping in line with how she knew her character would behave.<br /><br />There were a few things that kept me from rating the book higher.<br /><br />1) The switch between points of view was soft and confusing. The two main characters act in such a similar fashion that it could be hard to tell who was who. There were times where I would forget whose point of view I was reading  and have to go back and check.<br />2) The transition at the end from how life was to how it is was sort of weak. There were a few simple, basic explanations, but it was almost hard to picture the community after everything happened. It felt a bit rushed, like the author didn't want to write much of the book after the main climax of the story.<br />3) The issue with genetic purity/vs damage was also sort of weak and unrealistic. It simply doesn't seem like something that would have wiped out so much of the population so quickly. I think there could have been a stronger element to why that happened.<br /><br />These few things aside, the book still held my attention and kept me turning pages to see what happened next. It's important to go into it expecting the characters to be true to self, however. If you just want a nice, puzzle-perfect fit, contented ending,you may find yourself disappointed.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Son's review:<br />Takes to long to upgrade land dragon vale<br /> is a much better game this game just take s two long
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I bought my first Iron Maiden album when I was a teenager.  When I got to college I moved away from metal into other genres but I have always been a metal head at heart.  I added this to my collection and love the new sound and songs. You cannot find any better metal band than Maiden.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|the only problem is the nickle and dimeing they do in game they want you to keep paying for extras I would rather just pay once if at all
B00FMZSN8Y|3.0|Definitely not Disney's best little golden book movie version, but it gets the point across.  My 4year-old enjoyed it.  We are looking forward to the movie.  PS-Not as bad as some reviews made it out to be.
1419702238|5.0|My son loves this series. He read this book in one day! And the price it was well worth it. Anything to see him read. Looking out for the other volumes at the same great price
B007N8RULO|5.0|It is different from the other solitaires & makes me, like the others, think about what I am doing & that is one reason I do puzzles.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|The Hangover Part III is so so, not good as the The Hangover Part I and The Hangover Part II.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|No complaints here. Works very well and helps me out tremendously daily. Helps organize my tasks and lists. Love the checkmark list the most.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Game is fun but with 8 hour breeding time plus 8 hour hatching time slows down dragon creation. Treasure<br /> can be made and treats grown easy.  Once again getting gems to speed things up is pretty much left to buying until your  island builds up.  Be prepared to spend money to make this game move along<br />.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Great movie, and maybe the best Disney movie of all time cant say enough good things about it. See this movie!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great fun! Can't stop playing it....I just wish you could customize your robot even more. I hope there is a new version by the time I finish this one.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Who isn't haunted by their mother?  Awesome story, captivating characters, it's a beautifully written novel.  Must read, Flynn's best by far!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This has been the best app I've used for the weather. I gave used other apps but this one works better and gives me the information I need.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy Crush is very fun and very addicting! The only thing I would say is I can't get past level 8 but I guess that's my problem! :)
B00847KFDS|5.0|Even after all these years, Fogerty's unique talent shines through in this duets/interpretations of his music. This is a needed addition you you music collection
B0091V6TJ0|5.0|It is mindblowing that this stuff was sitting on a shelf somewhere.  If you're a Can fan, I think this box is a must-have.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Have seen Forrest Gump many times and it is enjoyable each time.  I like Tom Hanks and this is one of his best movies.
0385537131|5.0|As always Grisham is a talented writer.  This book is not any different, but IMHO it is in the top 2-3 books he has written.  At times I was sure I knew what was happening, at other times I thought he was confusing the reader.... but the ending is GREAT but rather unsettling.... and you can not wait to tell friends they need to read the book.  I have already bought a second one to loan to friends and family members. Mostly new characters tell the story of Seth who is dying and RICH.  When he gives most of his money to a very unexpected lady... the relatives and lawyers all head for the courthouse.  Deep character development and a feeling that you (the reader) are part of the cast... makes this a really outstanding  read.  Go for it or you will be sorry !!!!!!!!
0345803450|3.0|A little slow and a little heavy politically, but an OK story. Not the best writing either. Read for my book group
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love Draw Something! This game is so much fun to be able to interact with your friends and send drawings back and forth with each other! On my list, a must-get!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|great game but buggy on my 1st gen. Fire. Keeps freezing or totally kicking me out. Would like to see these issues resolved.
B00C5R8364|4.0|This is vintage Forsyth, meaning it is all about the technical, step-by-step process his hero uses to track down and destroy the villain. Don't buy this book if you are looking for constant action and endless shoot-em-ups, but if you are already a fan of Forsyth's work, this is almost a throwback to the \\"Jackal\\" days.<br /><br />A charismatic cleric known as The Preacher is using Internet sermons to inspire young Muslim fanatics in the U.S. and Britain to assassinate government figures. As these Preacher inspired incidents escalate in scope and violence, U.S. government spy hunter Kit Carson -a Marine officer codenamed The Tracker - is tasked with hunting the cleric down. Carson has a dazzling array of hi-tech tools at his disposal, but his quarry is well aware of them and has insulated himself by going low tech, refusing to use a cell phone or radio. His taped sermons are delivered to his distributor through a series of cut outs and couriers, and he could be anywhere in the world. Still supported by drones and satellites, Carson must fall back on HUMINT, or human intelligence, including agents in place, friendly intelligence agencies, and a severely introverted computer genius. Then, suddenly, for Carson the hunt becomes intensely personal, a mission of vengance.<br /><br />As the pieces of the puzzle begin to come together, The Preacher realizes he is in danger and prepares a gruesome last act before going to ground. Carson must find a way for the leaders of two nations to take a huge political risk. And he finds more than his reputation on the line when, as part of an elite commando team, he parachutes into hostile territory in a last ditch effort to save an innocent boy and stop The Preacher.<br /><br />This is a page turner in the grand Forsyth tradition, and, I can say truthfully, a great beach read. But I do have a major quibble. The strength of such a book lies in the conceit that the omniscient author is providing you with authentic, inside information thathe is privy to, and that his descriptions of techniques, materials, and equipment are true. Any simple error can shatter that illusion and Forsyth makes a major one. When a young American kills with a Glock pistol, Forsyth describes it as \\"Swiss made\\". The Glock is an Austrian pistol and, what is more, a Glock purchased in the United States, as this one is claimed to be, would have been made in the U.S., one of only two places the Glock is officially made (the other being, of course, Austria). Perhaps he confused it with Sig Sauer, a Swiss company that manufactures pistols in Germany (because of Swiss laws) and the U.S. In any case, it is a simple, easy to check fact, and flubbing it calls into question everything else the author is telling you.
1451666179|5.0|Now Hyperbole and a Half can go with me everywhere. It's like a new dimension, reading the blog bits in the treebook - plus the new parts are just as top-drawer. The plain-spoken stories and uncomplicated drawings make me laugh, cry. The Depression chapters are right on target, and you can tell Allie is a Real Person because she gets dogs. the end
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you want to publish on Kindle, this is indispensable.  I learned so much from the book and how to publish my own book - &#34;An Advent Sojourn&#34;.
B00E7SXPVW|5.0|The new mix is a nice alternative to the original.<br />Nice to have the b-sides in one place as well.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|All of liBii' s salon games are really fun! Princess salon, wedding salon, and prom salon are my personal favorites! The only reason why I would give all of them 3 stars is because there isn't much of a selection of girls, make-up, or dresses unless you pay $2 So if you want the real version, you have to pay $2. This is really a very limited version! But still fun! :)
B00E89VXQY|3.0|Haven't they put out new music since 2005??? According to this cd one could only derive that the answer is NO!
B0093WVND4|4.0|Roald Dhal books are a hit in our family and my daughter and wife had a lot of fun reading this book together.  It is also in the elementary school preferred and testable reading list at our school, so my daughter got extra credit for reading it and taking a test.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have this app on my Nook tablet as well. When I got my Kindle I looked for alternatives (trying to be frugal) but found nothing that came close after reading the reviews on the other calendar apps. Knowing this app was already excellent it didn't take any arm twisting. With our active family and several schedules to coordinate this app is perfect because we all use Google calendar. I like that I can set an appt on it while out and as soon as I have WiFi it syncs with my Google calendar without me even having to think about it.<br />I highly recommend this app!!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Be aware....once you begin reading \\"The Name of the Wind\\" you will be like magnet drawn to magnet. Skillful, fluid writing moves the story of Kvothe through deep channels of turbulence into spaces of calm only to drop over a roaring white waterfall. This is fantasy at its finest, worth each one of the five stars.
0553384775|5.0|As a gracious host. Jordan Belfort graces the mind with wit and humor that will at first seem like a strange taste in your mouth but will leave a satisfied feeling afterwards. Far from humble, this book describes a power brokers struggle to make the important parts of his business work. With personal escapades, women and stifling situations galore the book is fun to read. Just don't get caught up in the glamor of it yet, wait for the movie for that.<br /><br />There are two distinct sections of the book. The rise and the fall. Unfortunately, the character does not change much over the course of the book regardless of what issues he is going through. Another book is in process so we might see a different side of the wolf later.<br /><br />This book has its fair share of sex, drugs and rock and roll. Trophy wives, mistresses and the family Jamaican maid. The author spends as much time on the wolfs inner circle in order to amp up the thrill. The book is written with lots of dialogue and in the first person. It was a good read, I really enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Well written. I honestly only read it to monitor what my son was reading. I wasn't, thrilled with the theme of we are powerless.Hopefully the next two have a better theme for young readers than doom.<br />Some people have been having game parties with their children pitted against each other while they dress as capitol residents. It is something I find disturbing. Especially with the parrells to history and in some parts of the world present day.<br />Overall an easy read but the content is really for an audience much older than it is marketed to. Talk with your kids even teenagers about the content.
0385537131|5.0|This book is brilliantly written, great characters, lots of twists and great end.  Masterfully done. Way better than I expected
B00BT68IWG|4.0|Roald Dahl books are a favorite in our house (I loved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as a kid and as a movie (yes the Gene Wilder one)).  My daughter had a great time reading this book with mom.  Highly recommended!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I wanted to read this before seeing the movie.  I enjoyed it.  It wasn't what I had expected from seeing the movie previews, it was better.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|One movie that my husband and I agreed upon.  We watched it together on our plane to Hawaii.  Very entertaining with a surprise twist at the end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|GREAT graphics and all around addiction for horse lovers! It takes some money to be able to get all the good stuff, but it's still a fabulous game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!!!!! I load up on coffee and start playing this game then i lose time and nothing gets done.
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|I totally missed this entire season while it aired on TV. So I spent the rest of the that summer avoiding to know who the mother is (which they showed at the end of this season). The week before the DVD arrived at the door, my Facebook feed betrayed me by showing the face of the mother from the HIMYM fan page... Go figure. This is a great show and this season has picked up some of its funny back. Enjoy
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Wholesome, quality entertainment for a genteel audience. The characters are likable and mostly believable. The plots are engaging, but somewhat predictable. The pace is often a little slow, but that actually lends to the atmosphere of a bygone era that was characterized by a more measured cadence of daily life than is seen today.
B000FC12SM|3.0|This book has not grabbed me yet.  I find it too full of stereotypes and too simple in its language and approach.  The case studies which are few as far as I can tell are more interesting.
B00FJU1HLC|2.0|The quality of the HD was good, the movie was ok, Kinda funny my 5 year old niece had no interest so I guess now we don't need to buy it :)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I almost didn't buy this book because I found the title to be silly. Also, it had so many great reviews that I got suspicious - I've been fooled by reviewers before. I'm glad I decided to buy it - it was sitting in my Kindle for a while, but when I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.<br />Odly enough, the husband's \\"secret\\" doesn't really matter - I mean, a lot happens because of it, but finding it out is not the point. I read some one star reviews justified by the secret being too obvious. But the secret is not important, what really matters is how it affects the characters and how they react to it.<br />I agree with some one star reviewers that the love triangle is lame and not believable, but it's not the main story and still you have some curiosity about what is going to happen.<br />I loved the epilogue, but I must warn that it's not a \\"happy ending\\". If you're looking for that, skip this book.
B002QE3CTY|2.0|Didnt realize it was similar to the Hunger Games!! I was going to read it because our school had the students to read it.
1451666179|5.0|Ive been following her blog for many years, and preordered this book the moment I could!<br /><br />It is beautifully printed on thick glossy paper, and a wonderful selection of all her best posts - including some new ones!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|95% luck, 5% skill.  Resist urge to buy boosters or gold/coins.  Certain levels require persistence!  Need more free gifts to motivate players.  How about some free daily gifts?!
B00ESNE696|5.0|This season every week has been a shocker!!  I love the interaction and intrigue between all of the characters.  It is a joy to watch Alicia grow and develop into the strong independent attorney that she can be.  I hope the marriage works out with Peter yet we will see.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Saw it a long time ago and enjoyed seeing it a second time might even look at it again sometime
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Politics and law are mixed with discrete sex and little violence in this season.  It is scary to know that this happens in real life.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved Fall of Giants, the first book but enjoyed the second book even more. Can't wait to read the third in the trilogy.
B003ZSISGM|5.0|Excellent plot, beatiful dialogues, well balanced, I could not put it down. So sad he cannot continue creating novls like the trilogy.
B005LAZIRY|5.0|This album has very beautiful progressive rock with elements of progressive metal.  I for one can not stand the growling vocals and hope that Opeth records more along the line of Heritage.
B00AZ7V0W0|4.0|I picked up this set on a special deal for $25. The set is in a compact case which is great for saving space. Most of the movies come with extras especially the first movie. There is also a disc of special stuff but surprisingly it's a DVD not a bluray like the other discs. The one minor gripe is that only the first movie is on its own disc. The rest of the movies have 2 per disc. So, movie 2&3 are on disc 2 and so on. Kinda not cool as I'd like each movie on its own disc.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|What a talent. Very fun and energetic music. Joe definately has a gift for song. I love this disc. Easy download.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The Lead character is no longer naive.  Alicia is learning to bend the rules to win inside and outside the court.
B00915G6SU|5.0|Criminal Minds has always been an excellent show. The FBI profilers travel around the world to catch serial killers by studying their human behavior. Joe Mantegna is my favorite actor on this program. All of the other actors do a great job too on this show. During season eight the FBI dealt with an unsub known as the Replicator throughout this season and it kept me on the edge of my seat.
B000NMY7CM|5.0|This movie gave you every emotion there is when you are watching it and I recommend this to movie to anyone that likes heart felt stories.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is GREAT!. It is user friendly. I am a senior citizen and am usually very slow navigating through apps, but this JW Library is so easy to use. I am still exploring it as I can't get enough. I love reading my Bible daily though this new app. Thank you Brothers!
B003WKOU0G|5.0|Four babies who are growing up in four very different places on the planet teach us that love is a language that transcends culture, place and time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app!! It works every time and opens quickly. I use it daily and  recommend it highly for all ages.
B00ERIUO02|1.0|her music is same and same not change.. i just love Unconditionaly, walking on air, roar and dark horses. sorry :(
B00CL151G4|4.0|Elementary is a pretty good show because this another cop-consultant show which I enjoy along with these other shows such as The Mentalist, Castle, Perception and Numbers. Johnny Lee Miller is very good at playing Sherlock Holmes and Lucy Liu also is terrific at playing Watson. Holmes and Watson always catch the criminals on this show and that is what I like about this program.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This is a great movie from beginning to end and it give you everything you wanted in a blu-ray it is a great purchase and well worth it to add to your collection.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have loved this game on my smart phone, so I'm happy it is finally available for the Kindle. Its so addicting.
1451666179|5.0|I read only one page before I was laughing uncontrollably. You'll love it if you're a fan of the blog, and you'll love it if you've never even heard of Allie Brosh before. Absolute hilarity, from simple dog to PARP!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good exercise for the brain.  Can be tricky at times. Every move must be exact or you can't win. Sometimes it's a matter of choosing the correct move when there is an equal choice. Win or lose, it makes you think.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|this is completly best Greatest hits ever... I lovee it, but kinda dissapointed Breakaway not include in this album but nevermind the rest is brilliant !!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Loved the book. Tried the first experiment and it worked within 12 hours. Have others in play now. We'll see how they go. I am confident. We'll worth the read. It's not long.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I know that many people were disappointed with the book because it didn't give them exactly what they wanted.  I think if you step back and think about the arc of the entire series, you will have a new appreciation for this book.  Unlike other dystopian YA series, this one is cohesive and well thought out.  It tells a complete story instead of trying to wrap up all the loose ends in the last 20 pages, like the Hunger Games did.  Obviously, there are some areas that could be improved, but overall it is a quite beautiful series.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Where do I begin! I was waiting for this book to come out, about as much as I am waiting for the movie. I LOVE the romance between Four and Tris..they are definetly ment to be.<br /><br />The Allegiant are a group who want to overthrow the fractionless. They want their lives back. Tris, Four, Uriah, Christiana, Caleb and Peter leave their city in hopes to see what is on the outside. I am not a fan of the worls within a world with Big Brother watching every move they make. It took some of the utopian feel out of the book for me. I may have stopped reading but the relationships Tris has with Caleb and Four make you read on.<br /><br />Tris and Four learn more about where they come from and the Divergent gene. It threatens to tear them apart.<br /><br />I would have given the book 5 stars but I dislike the ending. It was written beautifully and you can feel the sadness and loss....but is not the ending I hoped for. In some of the other reviews I have read people are saying Veronica Roth ended the series this way so there is no hope for more. So there would be an end. I can see that, I just don't think you should anger your fans in the process.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|This book is intriguing from the very beginning. Jack London brilliantly shows how harsh reality is for a basically wild dog.  The book is written with plenty of style and talent. Jack London unfortunately did not hesitate to kill a beloved character.  Overall the book is wonderful and I would definitely recommend it to any reader.
B00FG1Q5J8|3.0|For a mobile game that was in development for over 2 years I expected what was originally billed as &#34; a cross between Star Trek and Game Dev Story.&#34; Instead Star Command is a rather dull button-pushing game with virtually zero tactical elements.<br /><br />The game progresses in a way that is completly linear and almost impossible to deviate from. It's a charming looking game which helps hide the fact that it's also quite boring. Not worth more than a dollar.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I didn't like Ben Affleck for his acting but his direction in movies is in a word Superb.  The Town, Gone baby Gone, and now Argo. Bravo Ben!!!!! Please don't make a mockery of being Bruce Wayne/Batman.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book kept my attention enough to finish it the day I started it. John Grisham never lets down. The main character Malcolm had me at GO. And in traditional Grisham fashion, he leaves you wondering if Malcolm really did the original crime. The twists and details make you want to continue to the next page. What next? Have to love it! Again, Grisham makes me run to his next book!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great book especially if you are interested in the World War One era.<br />Warning: It will make you loose sleep because you can't stop reading it when it is past time to go to bed.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|great game! you don't have to way to long to complete missions. Fun way to kill time when your bored.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I liked how unique the format was, in having the story told through audio tapes from the main character. I also liked all the characters, and thought this was a very insightful look into the lives of teenagers, and the real pain and frustrations they have in growing up. Very well written, engaging and different from anything I've read.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I can`t get enough of this game. It is fun and addicting. It is a must have for all gamers.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't get enough of it. I play it every night. My kids can even play it. The best game ever.
1439177783|4.0|Interesting book. Short but did shed some light on the subject. Bought this a few years ago but forgot to leave feedback.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was very suspenseful and I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend reading this book if you like fast paced and suspensful.
B000EVQ56S|5.0|I gave this to a huge fan. They were so pumped and won't stop playing it. This is a great album.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|the main draw for me with the Chromecast was the ability to take it anywhere, mainly on trips where i'm visiting people, and plug it in and have the music and movies available. I don't even do it that much, but the idea of building a collection of purchased media that is portable is more attractive to me than spending money for digital copies that are accessible in just once place. Controlling it from my phone is just awesome, and now I actually have a reason to spend money on a digital library of movies.
B004Y1WCDE|3.0|This is SLOW, comparatively, the pictures in my library do load thumbnails fast but ~60% of the time will not actually load the image when clicked. Works great on streaming video though and I guess that's what really counts here
0143122916|5.0|No escapee from a prison/labor camp has been more straightforward about his/her ordeal than Shin Dok-hyuk. Others have had different backgrounds -- usually from educated families -- but Shin was born in the labor camp. This affected his entire survival strategy and his long recovery from the ordeal. Unlike the famous The Long Walk, this book's veracity has never been challenged. Another effective memoir, Escape from China, relates the escape of one of the Tiananmen heroes from the state, and it, too, rings with honesty. However, the author, Zhang Boli, came from a background that was indeed privileged compared to Shin's. Shin's escape and his lengthy healing process attest to the toughness and ingenuity of the human spirit, even if the human being has never been treated like one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has a great story line. I found the characters very complex and the chemistry refreshing. A good read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very entertaining, the story has its up and downs and it seems to be the preparation for the final book. Still want to know more about the uprisings, ends quite abruptly.
0670024856|5.0|Yet another Elizabeth Gilbert success. She is so fabulous. You will just fly through this book. I got it less than a week ago and I am almost finished!
B004FOA84A|5.0|This was a very enjoyable game to play. the graphics are absolutley beautiful and I woud buy this game again
1608871827|5.0|I like the movie so much and decided to buy the book. I ordered it on September 20, 2013 and Amazon told me that the item is out of stock, so it will be shipped by the end of October 2013. I was a bit disappointed and hoping that i can get the book sooner. Then, on September 12, 2013, i received an update email from Amazon that the book is back in stock. I was so excited. It has been shipped on October 17, 2013 and arrived in front of my door on October 22, 2013! :D I’m so glad i finally got it. Good job, Amazon! The book is great, especially as a coffee table book (for nerds of course)! It is approximately 11.5  x 10.25 x 0.75 inches and features tons of concept artworks, Jaegers’ blueprints, character profiles, kaiju designs, and etc. There are 2 propaganda posters and stickers attached inside the book as well. It's worth every penny and i just love it!
B0029QRA1U|3.0|did not do what I expected. they no longer change to MP3. I had to get another program.. it added another step.
B00204AA0O|4.0|This was my first Regina Spektor purchase. I really like it! Refreshingly different from the \\"chart toppers\\" played on the radio (yes, I'm one of the few people who still listen to the radio in the car)... I've always been a fan of Kate Bush & Tori Amos & I wouldn't be surprised if Ms. Spektor took cues from them. I love when an artist breaks through the conveyor belt of cookie cutter music, although it never lasts long enough. The big companies get too greedy, while the best artists get waylaid & overrun by pop plastic..... Hooray for those who dare to be different!!!!!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I think this is a great series with sooooo much wonderful stuff and ideas and views on things. I am not a fan of how it ended yet it is not my story to tell. I still recommend this series to people.
6305252572|4.0|48HRS, a classic action comedy from the 80'S<br />this is about the DVD and Blu-ray release of this classic film<br /><br />Eddie murphy's first film and he's a Natural in the film<br />Great comedy performance and same with Nick Nolte Great performance aswell<br />Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy are a perfect team in this film<br />Brilliantly Directed by Walter Hill from the first scene to the last scene<br />i have the 2006 DVD reissue of the film<br />so the DVD release on the amazon listing is wrong<br />the cover shown is correct but the release date is wrong<br />the picture and audio quality on the 2006 reissue is excellent<br />bright coloured Widescreen the Audio is Digitally remastered in 5.1 surround sound aswell<br />better than VHS quality for sure<br /><br />but very Dissapointing there's no special features at all<br />No new interviews with Walter Hill or Nick nolte or Eddie murphy about the making of the film<br />not even an Audio commentary by Walter Hill<br />there is only a Theatrical trailer<br />but at least the picture quality looks excellent, brilliant Widescreen transfer<br />very Disgusting that there's no extras except for the Trailer<br />a classic film like this deserves a special edition for sure<br />this film deserves a Interview with Walter Hill, Eddie Murphy or Nick nolte at least<br />but Dissapointing for some reason Paramount pictures have not released a special edition of this film.<br /><br />but Paramount have released this film on Blu-ray, which i think is a waste of money<br />cause the blu-ray reissue is the same as the DVD release<br />absolutely no new interviews at all except for Theatrical trailer<br />maybe the films presentation has been given a blu-ray upgrade to HD quality.<br />i havn't seen the blu-ray version cause there's no extras at all<br />so i didn't bother wasting my money buying it, i already have the DVD release.<br /><br />Hopefully one day Paramount pictures will get a wake up call and finally realize<br/>that this classic film deserves a special edition Blu-ray release<br />with all new interviews with Walter Hill, Eddie murphy and Nick Nolte<br />but who knows so don't Hold your breath waiting.<br />if you think the blu-ray is worth buying<br /> just to check out the film's presentation if it's HD or not then fine burn some cash.<br /><br />i'm staying with my DVD release<br />i gave this review 4 stars cause i love the film and the DVD 2006 reissue<br />picture and audio quality is Good enough for me in terms of Quality<br />if the new blu-ray release had all new extras like new interviews<br />then i would give it a 5 star rating but sadly it's barebones release.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game starts off easy, but gets progressively more difficult.  I would recommend<br />it to kids of all ages, and they would probably master it much quicker than me.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great sequel to the series! Wonderful writing and continued character development. I can't wait for Entwined with you! So excited!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love all DA - keep it coming for many years to come.  Best television available for anyone who hungers for real viewing!
159463176X|4.0|I thought his other two books were better.  This book jumped around a lot and at times it was difficult to follow.  I hope he continues to write as he is one of my favorite authors.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Worked really well on my kindle so I decided to download it to my cell phone. Works effortlessly on both.
B00DCRE8TW|5.0|Excellent album! Has a slightly more modern rock sound with a Mad Season feel. Listened through a couple times and picked up more to appreciate each time. Definitely recommend
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Delightful read.Bridget is as scattered and loveable as ever. Enjoy the ride and ups and downs. It will make you smile.
B00003CXAW|5.0|A classic for a reason. This is a masterful presentation of one of the greatest films ever made. The film itself is a true classic (despite some dated attitudes towards women and certain ethnicities) of adventure and excitement. The special effects may not be convincing but they're never dull to watch. The special features are a treasure trove for any fan.
0446556726|5.0|OMG My husband and I purchased this book on CD for when we travel. With each chapter it was like I was watching a movie. The reader was awesome.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is an awesome app. if you are a horse person you will love it. my horse is Milo he loves the different games and I enjoy playing them too
0385344228|5.0|I was eager to read this book with all the popularity hype it was receiving but I typically read an author in order of publication date.  This forced me to listen to the stand-alones of MISSION FLATS and THE STRANGLER before getting to this one.  I wasn't too impressed with either book for various reasons which then made me question how my third read from this author was going to impress me.<br /><br />DEFENDING JACOB did live up to the hype and I was very impressed.  The book had a good pace and it kept me interested from beginning to end.  It was a whodunnit, a psychological thriller, and a court room drama.  It was a murder mystery and an engaging story about family.<br /><br />I thought this book could end in a multitude of ways.  While the ending was a bit predictable in one manner, I thought it surprised me in another way.  Not sure it was my favorite of all possible endings but I'll just say it did do the story justice.<br /><br />Looking forward to his next book because I have now concluded that each book is better than the last.  I wish him luck topping this one.  Hopefully the success of this book doesn't drag out the release of his next one as I have seen with some authors in the past.<br /><br />Strongly Recommended
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Great game very addictive used to play it on my phone wanted on my kindle with it being free was easy to start playing again and enjoyed replaying it you do not have to spend real money at all to play and progress
B008602KQI|3.0|I read parts of the 1st book on a flight years agao and sort of felt the same way, though I have to say the film was better than the movie, because it was less thinking and tlaking and focussed (relatively more) on the action.  Still there wasn't a ton of that, it really only started about half-way thru the film.  I probably wont watch the other films in this series unless I'm bored.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|It's time to saddle up for another go around with my personal favorite Doctor, paired with possibly my favorite companions (I do feel the Ponds function best as a duo.) We also finally meet the Silence, which is a frightening and clever foe indeed. Things perhaps fold back on themselves a little too much in this season but I still can't get enough of it.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is unquestionably one of the greatest albums ever recorded.  Anyone giving this album one star ought to get their hearing checked.  The songwriting, instrumentation, lyrics, and singing are absolutely perfect on this album.  It's not often that you get an album where every single track is a great song.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I really enjoy this game! You can easily spend a few hours getting your vamp through the perils. Lots of fun
B004UID2LC|4.0|The app sometimes doesn't work, but over all its a really fun app. My whole playlist on my kindle mostly consists of thing i've gotten on this app. Buy it!
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|The DVD is ever thing I had hoped it would be, and the movie is worth the wait, nothing else to say
B00499QUK2|5.0|I missed these when they first came out on PBS.  My daughters told me I would love them, so I was ecstatic to find them on Amazon.  I will watch them all!
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Really good plot storyline action-packed and lots of drama just like a soap opera should. But most of all it was so original I've never seen another movie like it since  Even considering purchasing the DVD and Blu-ray
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I seriously cannot, for the life of me, understand why this album has gotten such negative to lukewarm reviews.  It truly is one of the most underrated albums ever made.  I'm not giving 5 stars because I think it's a good album, I'm giving it 5 stars because I consider this to be a masterpiece and one of the greatest albums ever made.  The songwriting, lyrics, and execution of this album really do not get much better.  Is This It? may be a better album, but not by much.
0060555661|3.0|While the concepts are very good and still apply today, the historical information in this book is out of date and won't be relevant to many of today's readers.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have never written a review before for a book but this struck me so strongly I felt I needed to save others their time & money. I don't think I will pre-buy again or start a series before it is complete. The first books in this series were fantastic & this was so bad I questioned if it was even written by the same author. If it tuly is I almost feel sorry for her as she has surely cost herself a previously strong readership. As a reader a certain amount of trust is required of & given an author when investing in their creation. This is lost in this book. The problem wasn't only the end as many others have already mentioned... but the weakness & lack of continuity of this book in its entirety. Sadly what a dissapointment!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent game. Best ever played. Was a good enough challenge to keep me entertained, but not so hard as to frustrate me. It took about a week playing a few hours a day, but most entertaining week with a game ever. Worked on Kindle fire just fine. the graphics were awesome!
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Dr Seuss is timeless  I get tired of television and my family thinks I buy these movies so we have something for when the little ones visit.  I actually buy them for me and that benefits everyone<br />It was shipped and arrived without problem.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|I liked the campaign and the graphics everything was nicely done only complaint I have is the length of the campaign
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The 1st book in the series gripped you immediately and held your attention with new unexpected twists and emothional cliffs.  The 2nd book was OK in a different way, bringing a larger picture of the politics and life styles, but not quite as exciting.  This book is satisfying in that it brings closure and has a few surprises, but I don't think it would stand alone.<br /><br />There is action and emotion as before, but some of the action is almost too pact -- i.e. we expect her to succeed and she does.
B00180R06I|4.0|&#34;Vampyr&#34; is a landmark of German expressionism; the story of a man trapped in a nightmare. The nightmare is that he's in a town where a vampire is terrorizing a family, and he's got to find a way to stop it. The movie's got some really scary images, but I won't spoil the film here so all I can say is watch it!
B001HZK8FY|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3E30DJJOFAFD1]]In the book and movie, we bought from Amazon, the rich daughter's family owned the historical Boone Hall on Ilse Of Palms SC. Our son recently was married on the lawn behind the Big House (Boone Hall Plantation) in front of the marsh. To ad a little more excitement, there was a reason our son chose this site when both bride and groom and most friends and family live in Atlanta. The bride's family lived in North Carolina.<br /><br />The bride is a drummer in the Atlanta Pipe Band and yearly they compete in the Charleston Scottish Games held at the same grassy field behind Boone Hall in front of the old slave cabins by the marsh. The day after the wedding the 42nd competition was being held and many of the bride's band would be there for the compitition. Five of them played the wedding music. The bride's brother in his kilts walked her through the guests and 4 bagpipers and one drummer played. The wedding ended just as the sun was setting behind them. Only two of the around 75 guests were living close by and they had just moved there from Atlanta.
B00DYVU9K8|1.0|I'm a big fan of Lost in Translation by Coppola, but this movie is awful...very pointless and not very entertaining!
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I am a Depp fan so I enjoyed it.  I also grew up watching the original series so there is a bit of nastalgous (is that spelled right?) ;)<br />It was shipped and received without incident
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|Have found this to be quite addicting.  I want to see if I can beat my last score knowing that it is giving my brain a workout.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|How can this get anything but 5 stars?  Lets just exclude Alien 3 and the terrible 4th movie from this review.  Even if it was only the first two movies its still a great collection with tons of extras and a cool case.  Why are you even reading this, go buy it
B005WUHAX8|5.0|A little pricey but well worth every penny.  If you spent a ton of money on the Iphone and are like me, you worry about breaking it, getting it wet, etc.  The name says it all, this phone really is LifeProof and that says a lot considering I have a 2 and a 5 year old.  Took some fun video going down the waterslide with my kid.  If they make a LifeProof case for your phone, do yourself a favor and get it.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Works great, but you have to know how to use it, so if your looking at getting this know that it is not a tool that you can use without any skill.
0689835604|5.0|My baby is only 5 months, so she's not quite up to reading this, but I think it's very cute.  The flaps just add to it, where is baby's toes, behind the puppy (or something like that) so sweet.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|...fortunately it is a very short drive. Just a load of fun and frustrating as all get-out and I am loving it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am enjoying being able to play this fun game on my Kindle.  Unfortunately after Level 35 you need to get friends to give you a ticket in order to move on.  Will have to get the kids to hook me up to Facebook.  Am disappointed as I  thought I would be able to play and not depend on Facebook.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|I couldnt wait for this movie to come out on DVD since I missed it while it was in theaters.  What a let down! there was nothing funny.<br />I guess the magic finally ran out. (in a big way)
B009X00E18|3.0|Was looking for a case for my Kindle Fire HD and could not decided because there were too many options.  This one appeared pretty solid and was cost effective.  I am not disappointed but do wonder if there was another case that could have provided a little more protection.  So far has lasted almost a year and kept the Kindle working so maybe my concerns are unwarranted.
B000I9W08I|4.0|Hello Dolly - I've seen this show on tv long ago, but I'd forgotten the great music in this musical.  A delight to watch.
B00AN0KBJC|2.0|The books are so much better than the series. For one thing the series doesn't show the battle scenes and this is the reason why I fell in love with the books.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Loved the old star trek series and this one had a dialog by Roddenberry  (sp?) to go along with it explaining the pilot and some of the scenes.  Very interesting.
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|Not all of these movies are that exciting, but it is interesting to see them all again on a 16:9 scree.
B000YMDQQ4|5.0|So many great stories for most any kind of day that I was having.  I especially like the troll story and I will aways like the story of Bod, in the graveyard.
B0000793ZB|5.0|Simple Minds have been around a long time and are still performing (just in Philly on October 18) and releasing new material.  They have a lengthy catalog of music and like many groups that have survived the music industry have evolved over the years.  This album marked a change in direction for them from their earlier stuff, which I highly recommend checking out.  Once Upon a Time was highly successful commercially, also, as it followed closely after the song they performed for The Breakfast Club soundtrack, &#34;Don't you forget about me.&#34;  This was an excellent song, which they made their own, but is not representative of the material as a whole.  Highly Recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addicting. The only thing I don't like is you only get five lives then you can't play again for several hours. That is really hard when you have insomnia.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|I really want this season to live up to it's prequels. I love this series and am hoping that it doesn't disappoint.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Really fun and addicting game.  Can be really frustrating to keep running out of energy.  You just get into the game and then you are out of energy.  Otherwise really fun game.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|This one is the last of the &#34;Die Hard&#34; movies. The &#34;Die Hard&#34; fans will forgive its flaws and an aging Bruce Willis.
B00C3TCBFS|4.0|A little hit-or-miss but generally very well done.  &#34;Grenade&#34; and &#34;Radioactive&#34; work particularly well - Sharon's voice has never been stronger, and WTY's musicianship is at top level...
B000002LBH|5.0|Sadly The Smiths career (five years?) was too short but they released a lot of material in that time.  Morrissey and Marr wrote the music and Morrissey's gifts as a lyricist and vocalist combined with Marr's riffs and arpeggios gave them a sound that is absolutely unique.  When you hear it, you know instantly that it's them.  Simply a great piece of work and highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|it glitches and won't let me play regularly. disappointed.  I load the game start to play and then then i locks up and i lose the life.
B0019IB0II|4.0|In `My Stroke of Insight' Jill Taylor, a neuroscientist with a PhD, details from a scientific as well as a personal point of view what it was like to have a massive stroke.  Her particular stroke destroyed part of the left side (speech and logical thinking) of her brain.  Before her stroke at age 37, she was at a high point of her career and she would have known all about what was happening to her.  She wrote the book after her painfully difficult recovery which took eight years.<br />She was lucky to have professional friends and family who helped her through an almost super-human effort following her stroke.  It's important to realize the difficulty of rehabilitation following a stroke.<br />After a few years of primary progressive MS my symptoms were stroke-like.  My left side of my body was extremely week.  I struggled to walk with a cane and a leg brace.  My Doctor sent me to a state-of-the-art stroke rehabilitation program for two intensive weeks.  It was multi-disciplinary, it was comprehensive, and it was exhausting.  Imagine trying to make your earlobes bend.  That's what it seems like you're up against when you try to find new pathways in your brain.  I have enormous respect for what Jill Taylor has accomplished.  Few people could do it.<br />Jill Taylor has managed to recover much of her pre-stroke former brilliance.  It is inspiring and informative to learn what she went through.  I have a few problems with her writing style and with some of her insights.  But, they are minor compared with the book as a whole.
B00001ZWTT|5.0|Anyone who loves steampunk will love this movie that set the trend and shows steampunk in a fascinating way! Way to go!
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Interesting that the Die Hard series of movies has been on as long a run as it has. Well worth getting for any &#34;Die Hard&#34; fan.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|While some of the text frankly went over my head, I believe that what Dr Perlmutter contends, is true. I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease (CD) in 2009, and have kept a very strict gluten free diet. I never had typical CD symptoms. All of my symptoms where neurological. Gluten Ataxia as Dr Hadjivasolliu has termed it. My brain was under attack. Going gluten free has saved my life.<br /><br />Inflammation is the enemy to all of our health issues. This book explains why and what you can do about it.<br /><br />I've been a vegan since 2011. I'm at a crossroads as to where to go from here. I'm also, as I write this, awaiting test results to find out if I have other food sensitivities my gut doc ordered this week.<br /><br />I recommend this book.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Thought that we'd seen them all, but only saw one or two that were familar.  Lots of fun to see them all.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|these cables are of good quality and i feel i got a wonderful buy.  highly recommend any one to buy these.  thank you
